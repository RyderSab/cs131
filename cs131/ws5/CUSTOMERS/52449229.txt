US	52449229	RQFNT8B4051HB	1841491799	816153289	The Last Battle: Dragonmaster Book 3	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A fitting ending	The first book, Storm of Wings, began with a typical boy-runs-away-from-home-turned-adventurer, except that the boy did not get apprenticed to powerful wizards nor warriors but learned to ride a dragon before getting conscripted into the war. He had enough sense and survived the war to become a veteran. After his unit got wiped out, the second part of the book began with heavy resemblance to WE Johns Biggles stories in the World War One when (military) aviation was in its infancy. <br /> <br />In fact, the whole development of the war and the stalemates were lifted almost directly from the events of World War One with disastrous results in attempts of breakthrough. Those familiar with the Great War could identify Somme as well as Gallipoli. <br /> <br />The second book Knighthood of the Dragon continued the war between Dermaine (Britain) and Sagene (France) on one side, and Roche (Germany) on the other. Here, the author adapted an episode from World War Two - The Great Escape. Eventually, Hal Kailas's side managed to break through and take the war into the lands of the Roche, despite it being slow going. The change of the nature of warfare in real world history to include destruction of civilian properties in order to starve the enemy into submission was also reflected. Hal Kailas ended the war as a hero and a lord. <br /> <br />The final book - The Last Battle, began with the end of the war. Veteran Hal Kailas who found himself enriched and ennobled found frustrations as he could not find a new meaning in his life - leading to the estrangement with his wife. He finally sought to do something - to repay the dragons for their contributions to the war, by finding out what caused the dragons to flee from their original unknown homelands across the Great Sea. <br /> <br />In this series, dragons were depicted as little more than aerial steeds adapted for war, with hardly more than animal intelligence. The dragons did not speak, breath fire nor cast magic. In fact, mankind had little fear of them, finding them nuisance to animal husbandry and even bully their youngs. The dragons did not have sufficient intelligence to recognise their innate advantages. <br /> <br />Hal put together an expedition to sail to find the mysterious original homeland of the dragons. <br /> <br />SPOILERS follows! <br /> <br />After some adventures, Hal discovered the dragons were fleeing demons. This could be taken directly from the movie Evolution, whereby an alien entity (the demon) entered the world, and began multiplying itself, taking the forms of the mightiest creature it encountered, through a series of speedy evolution. <br /> <br />While there was nothing really original in the series, the author's attention to details and ability to answer questions in the readers' mind through his narration was to be commended. <br /> <br />The author indeed convinced us that the \\"heroes\\" in the book knew what they were doing instead of being small-minded characters.	2005-06-06
US	52449229	R129BROB4ZU8R	078691565X	820363698	Dalamar the Dark (Dragonlance Classics, Vol. 2)	Books	1	6	8	N	N	Too many inconsistencies with existing DL	Had Nancy Varian Berberick played D&D before or read up on Dragonlance before writing this? <br /> <br />One of the most painful moments in this book is reading about Dalamar taking out a Blue Dragon by himself, by casting lightning bolts! <br /> <br />There is also the parts about not one but many dwarven mages running around the realms. <br /> <br />The portion about Dalamar taking the Test at the Tower of High Sorcery was not too bad though. <br /> <br />The book started off well enough.  After a prologue which basically recapitulated what readers of Legends already know, the first chapter set Dalamar as a lowly servant in a caste-rigid society of Silvanesti.  The elven kingdom was under threat by the dragonarmy - and Dalamar suggested strategy to hit the rear of the enemy when it was clear the elves were overpowered.  The strategy was carried out but the sheer might of the dragon against the elves meant it could not turn the tide after all. <br /> <br />The book followed with Dalamar fleeing along with the rest of refugees from Silvanesti to Ergoth where the haughty elves enslaved the wild elves inhabitants of Ergoth. <br /> <br />Through the process, until the elves returned to Silvanesti, the author made repeated shows of Dalamar losing faith and totally put off with the Silvanesti's obsession with the worship of Eli, or Paladine.  However, the true clerics had long ago been removed from Krynn prior to the Cataclysm and elven societies were supposed to have given up on the gods as well.  They may preserve the memories, but no cleric received any spells until (1) the Dark Queen granted her followers spells, and (2) Goldmoon became a cleric of Mishakal through the staff and the Platinum Discs were recovered.  Clearly the author missed out an integral aspect of the settings of Dragonlance.  An author may reserve her own creative license, but when writing within an established fictional setting, should either comply or set up her own.	2004-09-30
US	52449229	R3UMUV51MLIJW7	0786932023	448127848	Condemnation (Forgotten Realms: R.A. Salvatore's War of the Spider Queen, Book 3)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	TSR needs a better editor	This is the third book of what was promising to be an epic.  No other Forgotten Realms series, was planned to have so many books in the series.  The Sembian series was an exception, and it was focussed on individual characters of a single household.<br />The fact that this series will have different authors for each book is both a boon and a bane.<br />The boon was that the massive scope of the series will have rich contributions from various perspectives, making it more multi-dimensional and more credible.<br />The bane was that the same characters written by different people will inevitably have different interpretations.  Not all these differences are subtle, and I wonder at the end of Book 6, whether the characters will get as garbled as in a \\"secret message\\" game.<br />There were two threads of development in this book.  One followed the party of drow despatched from Menzoberranzan to Ched Nassad, the other on a secret organisation of male drows engineering attacks on drow cities.<br />Barely escaping with their lives when Ched Nassad was destroyed, the party of drow picked up two additional travellers, and considered on the next step in order to learn of the silence of Lloth, the Spider Queen.  Without her granting spells, drow societies, which had for millenias been ruled by her clerics, were under great tension and verge of breakdowns.  The enemies of the drow cities were quick to take advantage, with a deep dwarven kingdom and a fiend-led horde of evil denizens converging on Menzoberranzan.<br />Here, colourful characters were fleshed out through witty dialogues and stylistic actions.  Unfortunately for the book, editors, or the writer, failed to spot a number of irritating errors, which other reviewers have posted.<br />Another problem was the level of credibility.<br />The party of six drows and a draegoloth faced many enemies - their combat strength do not seem to be consistent.  One moment they could fight off powerful foes in an apparently deserted city, the next moment they were fleeing from mundane pursuers.  Then they would be taking on lower-planes denizens and an unusually powerful beholder.<br />There were several brief references to sexual encounters, which are reminiscent of Hollywoods obligatory nude scenes in many mainstream movies - these sections could have been better written to add to the characterisations.  Unfortunately, each section was little different from each other without adding anything new.<br />Nonetheless, I look forward to reading the next book as this book ended with cliff hangers on each thread development.	2004-06-11

The problem that besetted Drizzt &amp; Company was that the element of surprise, or the element of danger, had been missing for a very long time.<br />As a writer, Salvatore had painted himself into a corner in previous books by imbuing his characters with too much power.  Their losses had been greatly disproportionate to their victories.  While Salvatore tried his best to flesh out the characters as three-dimensional, with personal thoughts and fears, these efforts were kinda lost when they bashed through hundreds of orcs with relatively ease.  Readers had come to accept that they would win any battle they fight.  Throughout the history of Drizzt &amp; Co, their significant losses had been <BR>(1) when the barbarian Wulfgar was lost in the Underdark, and <BR>(2) when Wulfgar returned alive with serious psychological problems.<BR>Indeed, the only way to overcome this group appear to be overwhelming force - first it was war against the whole of Menzoberranzan, the drow city, and now, it is against the united horde of orcs in the north.<br />Now that introduction to Drizzt and Co is over, let's review what Salvatore had done in The Lone Drow, Hunter's Trilogy Book 2, continuing from A Thousand Orcs.<br />It has been a long time since I reviewed any of Drizzt books, simply because they did not incite in me a feeling that I was reading a *new* book.<br />In The Lone Drow however, the author Salvatore appeared to be opening a new chapter in the life of his famous characters.  Once-lovers, Cattie-Brie and Wulfgar came to terms with their relationship with each other as bosom friends.  Cattie had to consider seriously whether she would be Mrs Drizzt and mother to half-drow broods, and be gone long before Drizzt reached middle age.  Wulfgar had to convince himself that even as he had a wife and adopted child, it was all right for him to go adventuring and risk being killed (however small the chance of that happening!).<br />After success of Drizzt in Icewind Trilogy, Salvatore treated readers to his background in the Dark Elf Trilogy, and introduced &quot;musings of Drizzt&quot; in the books to reflect the development of Drizzt's personal philosophy, his responses to twists of fates and eventually, his acceptance of who he is.  Such musings were icings in the cakes in the earlier books.  However, it became stale when continued in books like Silent Blade when the assassin Enteri Artemis tried to prove himself superior to Drizzt.  It would have been more interesting if the musings came from Enteri as Drizzt should have been more confident of who he chose to be.<br />In The Lone Drow, the musings became relevant once again as Drizzt thought his friends - Bruenor, Regis, Wulfgar and Cattie-Brie, dead.  The noble drow ranger became the Hunter, burying his humane side in order to kill as many orcs as possible.  Here, Salvatore had a difficult task.  He had to bring out the savage beast in Drizzt, and yet keep him from doing anything to stain his noble self permanently.<br />In this book, heroes aren't as invincible as they had been.  Suffering serious injuries, they had to ask themselves whether they had committed the hubris of seeing themselves infallible in their decisions and in their fights.<br />In the meantime, a more interesting foe appeared, one more interesting than Enteri Artemis or Jaraxle, or even the drows of Menzoberranzan.  It came in the form of Obould Many-Arrows.  In the previous book, Obould was leader of great tribe of orcs, driven to seeking alliance with frost giants at the manipulation of four drows.  Obould was more far-sighted than ordinary orcs, a great fighter as well, but still an orc.  In this book, having received blessings from the orcish deity Gruumsh, he became frighteningly intelligent and wise - knowing the exact shortcomings of his orcs and able to keep situation from developing beyond his control.  He actually envisioned a practical plan on orcish domination of the north!  Traditional AD&amp;D orcs had always been strong but stupid, and too chaotic to unite to form a serious threat.  Obould changed all that.  His strategy could have come out from some of the most obscenely paid consultancy firms today (those that worked, not those that cheated.)<br />I hope the author will not disappoint in the last book - he has some very promising developments that could lead to a very exciting climax and bring himself to new heights as an author.	2004-03-22

This book is meant for those who are already familiar with Terry Brooks' Shannara stories.  It took place a generation after the events in Voyage of the Jerle Shannara and continued with some of the main characters.  Those who had not were only given very brief glimpse of the past, and the little details would not aid their enjoyment.<br />Returning from the previously unknown land of Parkasia, the reformed Ilse Witch inherited the mantle of druidhood, and from the last druid, the charge to reestablish the Order of the Druids in Perennor.  The other only other hero to feature here was the elven prince Ahren, half brother to the elven king who had despatched Ahren to get Ahren out of the elven court.  The other heroes like Bek Ohmsford were mentioned but did not make an appearance.<br />Creating a new Druid Council composed of representatives from (almost) all peoples of the Four Lands - humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and even trolls, was not difficult.  Making the Druid Council effective in its work to bring peace and a renaissance was.<br />Almost right from the start, leaders of two major states of the Four Lands - the Elven Kingdom to the northwest and the human Federation to the south, were personally opposed to the Druid.  The opposition were directed more personally at the Ard Rhys, head of the druid council and former Ilse Witch, rather than the Council itself, because of her past.  Because the Druid Order practiced open-door policy, the Order accepted many members who were not committed to peace but their own self-interests.  The disagreement among the members meant that little could be achieved even though members learned magical prowess and had the capability for impressive feats.  Even the chief of the Order could not make any progress because she wanted consensus rather than rule-by-force.  She believed that the new order would only be lasting if it avoided tyrannical methods and members mature on their own pace.  The picture is an uneasy reminder of thefailures of democracy when each group is more concern about its own immediate short-sighted self-interest.<br />Finally, despite her precautions, her enemies within the Druid Council managed to banish her to another world of existence.  Losing no time to seize power and eliminate potential avengers, her enemies despatched forces to seize the Ohmsfords.<br />The plot development were woven along three main threads.  The first followed the Ard Rhys as she strove to discover where she was banished to and tried to survive in the hostile world, and if possible, to return.<br />The second thread followed her enemies as they sought to consolidate power, and the successor to the head of the Council discovered some of the things that vexed her predecessor as the Ard Rhys.<br />The third thread introduced the new generation of heroes - Pen Ohmsford and Khyber (nephew to Ahren) as they fled from the force sent to eliminate the Ohmsford and sought for a way to return the Ard Rhys to the Four Lands.<br />What disappointed me about this is that Terry Brooks couldn't seem to change the geopolitical balance of the world which always weighed so heavily against the heroes.  The Federation, which was introduced in the Druid of Shannara series, remained in power and hungry for world domination.  After all that had taken place, they should have been out of business long ago.<br />As the first book of a new series, Jarka Ruus served as little more than setting the stage and introducing the characters.  Though it promises to be an exciting new story, I feel a little cheated that the entire book did not reveal more.<br />However, I am surprised that there is an element similar to Lord of the Ring's first volume - Fellowship of the Ring.  A quest is set, and a fellowship of heroes was formed to set on it, but before it could get very far, a major character, and possibly the most powerful member of the fellowship, perished, and the fellowship had to go on, greatly weakened.	2004-03-22
US	52449229	R1CZT11Z45NQLB	0312319517	604432126	Avenger	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Just can't put it down	The premise of the story is a little extraordinary - among the thousands who died in the chaos that followed the breakdown of the Yugoslavia was an idealistic American young man who had volunteered to provide humanitarian assistance in the conflict zone.  I used the adjective extraordinary because this young man was unusual among the victims, even among the relief volunteers, in that he came from a very, very wealthy family, which could unlike most families of other victims, could afford move heaven and earth to discover the truth of his death, and hire the Avenger bring the perpetrator to justice.<br />Unlike other thrillers which focussed on only a main characters, the author dealt fairly evenly with the cast of Avenger.  In Part One of the book, chapter titles such as the The Hard Hat, The Victim and The Magnate provided detailed backgrounds of the the Avenger, the victim and his wealthy grandfather who was a World War 2 veteran.  These main characters were further developed in subsequent chapters, while supporting cast such as the investigator hired to find out what happened to the victim merited their own chapters such as The Tracker.  The culprit who became the object of the hunt also got his own chapter in The Killer.<br />The author made clever use of compartmentalisation to weave different threads to represent different stages of development from different perspectives.  Besides introducing the major characters, chapters in Part One also helped to set the stage to explain why despite their wealth and influence, the family of the victim could not get the legal authorities to apprehend the culprit and had to turn to hiring a bounty hunter.  It also had a glimpse into the consideration of taking the law into one's own hands, the difference between killing the culprit and bringing the culprit to face legal actions.  I thought the author had written too short a section here and the subject offered more potential for scope.<br />One thing the author had done wellwas to avoid repetitive scenes in introducing the characters.  It would have been too much of a bore to see different characters go through similar rites of passage to become the kind of people they were at the onset of the story - priviliged/underpriviliged childhood, distinguished service in the military before making good on their own merit.  Here, the author managed to brew a different flavour for each individual.  Unfortunately, these rich background materials were almost lost in the later parts of the book, except for the Avenger's.  Sharp-minded readers could recognise characteristics and tools-of-trades from the Avenger's background being utilised in bringing the culprit to justice.<br />The end of Part One introduced a twist to the development - the hunt for the culprit would be hampered by the fact that the culprit might be being protected by some government agency.<br />Fewer major characters were introduced in Part Two, which detailed how the culprit was finally tracked down, and which government agency was protecting the culprit.  Characterisation slowly gave way to plot development.  Readers are introduced to the issue of &quot;setting a thief to catch a thief&quot;.  While this is a familiar old theme, the author painted a bleak picture of what it actually means to have to make deals with ruthless criminals in order to go after targets they consider more dangerous.  By now, the cast of characters had grown considerably, but the skillful characterisation means that readers are in little danger of losing track of the names.<br />The last Part of the book deals with the build up to the climax of when the Avenger would finally confront the criminal.  Here, readers see the Avenger being hunted down in a manner akin to the assassin in the author's early book, Day of the Jackal.  The Avenger had not only to go through false identities, but also lay false trails and avoid traps by authorities.  The manner in which the Avenger penetrated the heavy wall of protection surrounding the culprit is highly original which would become a classic.  I saw some reviewers commenting he had too much luck on his side.  My own careful reading indicated that luck had nothing to do with it, the Avenger was a survivor of Nam, and was a Tunnel Rat.  He was also a student of history.  He had to outthink worse opponents, and the so-called luck was actually advanced planning.  Luck was Luke Skywalker walking into Jabba's den and had Jabba decide to bring him and his friends out of the den to the Pit of Sarlaac.  Knowing where your opponent would run to and to wait for him is not luck.<br />In no part of the book did the Avenger depend on his superior firepower, martial prowess, personal charm or gadgets or some invicibility that plagued characters such as James Bond.  This is indeed another masterpiece from the author.	2004-03-12

He also produced some from a more common man's POV, such as Graveyard Shift.  Readers could actually feel the flesh and blood of the characters, or enjoy the plot development with unexpected twists.<br />No more.<br />Ever since he hooked up Sean Dillon, the quality of the writing steadily went down.<br />Readers do not feel the characters were going through any real danger, whether it be diving, flying, parachuting, sailing or driving.  The villains were mostly UK or US war veterans turned bad, and failed to impress.<br />The worse was it appeared to be a game played in the children's playground - police &amp; thief.  The good guys know where the bad guys are, and the bad guys know where the good guys are.  Ask the hacker, and bingo, you have your foes' complete historical dossier, his itinerary, not to mention the blueprint of his house, his boat and his plane.

While stories of twins separated at birth and unwittingly compete with each other is cliche, there is still scope enough to be explored to make a worthwhile novel.  This was not done in Sons of Fortune.<br />The publisher's extract from the inside fold of the hardcover flap was promising enough - twins separated, falling in love with the same girl yet never meeting until one defends the other in court and both end up running against each other for state governor.  Peter Cartwright became Fletcher Andrew Davenport, separated from his brother Nat.<br />One terribly handled aspect of the novel was the introduction and fade-out of important characters.  In the beginning, Ms Nichols, who was hired as nanny prior to Mrs Davenport's delivery, and Mr Davenport, who confirmed the swap, played crucial roles in the development of the story.  After a fairly well-done introduction, their characters became inexplicably missing from the later parts, no fade-outs, nothing.  This is inconsistent with the roles they took in the beginning, both had high stakes in the deception, and did not do justive to Mr Davenport who was not someone content to be in background without showing some interest in his \\"son\\"'s (Flether) future, either with respect to the family-owned pharmaceutical firm he married to or the fact that he and his wife tried very hard to produce an offspring.  In contrast, the hopes and expectations of Nat's parents continued to be addressed in the continuing saga.<br />In terms of character development, the author tried to be fair to both twins, but it was obvious that Nat got the much better end of the deal - scholarship, leading role in Shakespeare's play, the draft service in Vietnam and war hero, and to irreversibly tilt the balance, numerous love affairs in Italy.  Fletcher had to make do with patronage from a veteran senator.<br />The author might have drawn from hispast novels on American politics, namely, the Prodigal Daughter.  However, Sons of Fortune was much less vicious and dirty, and the villain of the piece, Ralph Elliot, was never given a chance to speak for himself, always being referred to in third party terms.  He was hardly a silhoutte, much less a character, another weakness in this novel.<br />The author did make a tantalising gap in the story, to be filled up later in the novel at \\"appropriate timing\\" and supposedly lead to the death of Luke, son of Nat Cartwright.  This death was pathetic though, and the complete failure of characterisation in the story - nothing in the story could give justification of Luke's death, unlike the suicide of the son in As the Crow Flies.<br />The ultimate letdown of the novel was in final resolution of the gubernatorial election between the two brothers.  Here, the author repeated practically verbatim what he had written in First Among Equals.<br />In all fairness, the book, on its own, had some value in being read to idle time away, and deserves more than 1 star.  I was going to give this 1.5 stars if I could, but it doesn't really deserve two stars.	2003-05-26
US	52449229	R1RM30I2WK1XVZ	0880389141	635010649	Night Watch (Tsr Books)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Regretfully, it was a standalone	TSR obviously did not know how a good stuff when they see one.  Some of its best books were published in innocuous covers with hardly any marketting support while it pulled out all stops for a number of its worst written drivels.<br />Night Watch, written by Robin Wayne Bailey (Thieves World), was published in 1990, just as TSR was experiencing a lot of difficulties (which they oft do but that's another topic).  Gary Gygax, founder and anchor writer for the Greyhawk series, had left and the company turned to other writers to carry on the Greyhawk series, the results which was so bad that it cancelled the series before Night Watch was printed.  As a result, Night Watch was published without the customary Greyhawk logo.<br />Despite not being a role-playing gamer, the author took painstaking efforts to study the Greyhawk setting for his first and only (to date) Greyhawk novel.  The results produced should put to shame the works of many other TSR authors who began with greater familiarity, both past and present.<br />Instead of trying to ride on the formula of previous Greyhawk writers, Bailey created his own - a detective thriller in a fantasy setting.  The novel was placed in an undefined time in Greyhawk, and without contradicting any canon, could be fitted almost anywhere in the Greyhawk timeline except the major wars.<br />Rather than revisiting the same scenes mentioned in the earlier Greyhawk book (Saga of the Old City), Bailey made his main character, Garett Starlen, captain of Greyhawk's Night Watch. He gave a brief glimpse to Garett's past, just enough to present him as an honest man, educated and competent in his duties without unjustified idealism, and was good enough to inspire loyalty from other competent subordinates - Blossom, a seven footer amazonian, Burge, a half-elf who hated his faerie ancestry, and Rudi, a short fighter sensitive to his height (or lack of).<br />Greyhawk, in an ordinary day, was bad enough.  The poor had a hard life, regardless whether they had an honest job.  The rich, protected by the privilige of wealth, spent their hours protecting their wealth.  The district for temples were lined with religious institutions of varying, even opposing, dispositions.  The city was governed by the Directorate, composed of various factions of power, including leaders of the Thieves Guild and Assassins Guild.  All were aware that orderliness, with a smattering of chaos, was in their best interests and hence the Watch was not merely an instrument of the elite.<br />Magic was very much part of life in Greyhawk, and the story opened with the successive murders of the city's fabled seers by their own instruments, all within one night despite being quartered in different parts of the cities.  It fell to the captain of the Night Watch, Garett, to investigate those murders, which were certainly caused by magic.  While the Watch could normally seek help from the Wizards' Guild, there was no response at the Wizards's Tower, and no sane person would intrude a wizard's lair, much less the Tower of the Wizards's Guild.<br />Further disturbances in the form of unusual flocking of black birds, inexplicable departure of the city by elves, warned Garett that an approaching danger, which was why the seers had been killed.  Garett could get no help from the Directorate, whose members were more keen in protecting or promoting their own interests than the city's.  It would take an intercession from one of Oerth's legendary Circle of Eight to provide Garett with the clue to the threat and the instrument to overcome it.<br />Readers familiar with Dungeons and Dragons or Greyhawk settings might be put off by the portrayal of magic in this book.  Instead of the usual spells like wands of fireball, the investigating characters were virtually bereft of magic.  Instead of an adventuring group mixture of paladins, clerics and magic users, they were all fighters belonging to the Night Watch. And when contact with the Wizards' Guild waslost, there was no other magic-user in the city of Greyhawk they could turn to, a phenomena any Greyhawk fan would vow as impossible.<br />But as someone who appreciates the essence of fantasy more than game-mechanics or statistics from RPG supplements, I really like what the author had done.<br />The clues were well laid, but it took the main character to act upon his gut instinct and against incompetent superiors to get anywhere.  Critics who say this is another Thieves' World novel in Greyhawk guise are probably right, but it should not mar the enjoyment of the novel.  I need only to point to the Knights of Crown series by Roland Green, set in Dragonlance setting, as another example of enjoyable fantasy novels borrowing an established setting but lacked the distinctive \\"essence\\" of the setting.  Even the recently published novel Keep on the Borderlands which was based on a well-known Greyhawk classic had hardly any Greyhawk-ness in it.<br />Having said that though, while I regret there is no sequel to Night Watch or Garett Starlen, to date, any further work should include more of Greyhawk-ness.	2003-02-21
US	52449229	RB11YY9HOASH2	0439064872	667539744	Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A little mystery, a little detective work, and a lot of fun	What positive values can be derived from JK Rowling's second Harry Potter book besides \\"fun\\"?<br />Well, as compared to the first book, the treatment of Muggles by the magical folks were less stereotypical.  Arthur Weasley, father of Ron Weasley, best friend to Harry Potter, offered an alternative perspective.  The Muggles, unable to do any spells, came up with non-magical solutions to handle problems in life.  An example was the development of lock-picking skills - something which apparently never occurred and a source of facsination to wizards who had become accustomed to using spells to overcome obstacles.<br />The author also showed the prejudice is a prevalent human nature that exists not only by Muggles like Harry Potter's guardian family against the magical folks, and vice versa, but also among magical folks between those whose antecedents were magical and those whose antecedents included Muggles.<br />For those who had read the first Harry Potter book, they might appreciate that JK Rowling added further development to her characters in the second book.  The principal characters showed either they learnt from the experiences from the earlier book, or revealed characteristic weaknesses in failure to wise up.<br />Plot-wise, unlike other authors who tried to re-use the formula of an earlier success, JK Rowling took the story through a different plot.  In reminiscent of good old traditional mysteries, more clues compared to the first book were scattered through the book on the identity of a mysterious adversary who plagues Hogswart, the school of magic.<br />What is similar to the first book was that the school staff at Hogswart maintaining an official denial to the source of the threat.  In the first book, the Philosopher's Stone (renamed the Sorceror's Stone in the movie) was a closely guarded top secret.

The ex-wife of Blake Johnson was murdered for trying to expose Jack Fox, a new generation of Mafia don in America.  Blake Johnson was a personal friend of the US President as well as the head of the Basement, a clandestine US agency which answered only to the president.  Clandestine my foot, Jack Fox easily got a gambling addict of a computer don to hack into government computers and found out all about Blake and the Basement, and no warning was triggered in one of the supposedly most secure computer systems in the world of intrusion.<br />Deciding to strip everything away from Jack Fox before killing him, Jake learned through the assistance of British G4 - Ferguson, Sean Dillon, Hannah Bernstein & recently added temp member hacker whiz Roper - that Jack Fox needed to snag several big illegal deals in Europe & Middle East to make good the financial losses he incurred in legitimate businesses.<br />What followed was a series of computer arcade style of shoot, bomb and destroy mission, with Dillon & Johnson targetting every one of Jack Fox's illegal business deals outside the Mafia.<br />Readers would get no kick as the heroes blast their way across from New York to London to Lebanon to Ireland.  The villains did absolutely nothing to counter Dillon and Johnson, except for a few minor attempts at reprisal.  Not even the flash-forward in chapter one whereby Johnson was captured and brought to Hellsmouth did anything to increase the excitement.<br />Higgins made a pathetic attempt to add dramatic tension by Hannah Bernstein's moral delimna of her boss Ferguson andher colleague Dillon's impunity at operating outside the law, and add another female gunner to balance her.  However, these fizzled to nothing than a few phrases to state she felt upset.<br />On the whole, there was nothing added to the recurring characters and the villain Jack Fox who was supposed to be a Desert Storm veteran played mafia like a backyard bully - and was even derided by Dillon and Roper as not lasting a minute in Belfast.<br />This book may suit those into the shooting arcade game culture, but nothing more.	2002-10-14

I did feel a little cheated when I discovered it.  Nonetheless, the two which I had not read did give undeniable pleasure.<br />Murder in the Mews took place on a location which Poirot and Inspector Japp happened to stroll by on the night of the crime.  Despite it being Guy Fawkes day, it was such a place that they remarked it would have been perfect for a murder.  And the next day, they were summoned to attend to a suspicious suicide at the very same location.  In this short story, Christie tantalised the readers with a myriad of clues, most of which would mislead rather than clarify.  A worthwhile mystery.<br />In the Dead Man's Mirror, Poirot was summoned by an old fashioned aristocrat, only to arrive moments before he apparently committed suicide.  This story appeared in another publication as \\"The Second Gong\\".  Suspicions were cast on the dead man's adopted daughter and his nephew - especially when it came to light that the aristocrat intended to cut them off without a penny if they did not abide by his wishes to marry each other.  It was important in this story for the reader to visualise as accurately as possible the scene of the murder in order to find proof whether it was suicide or murder.<br />The Incredible Theft was almost a carbon copy of \\"The Submarine Plans\\".  Two leading British politicians had a small weekend party which included a well-suspected female spy.  Ostensibly, she was included to entrap her, to catch her in the act.  However, when vital plans were stolen without a clue, the politicians had to call in Poirot to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  Poirot had to question all those present carefully to clear their names, or nail them with the evidence.<br />The last story, \\"Triangle at Rhodes\\", had Poirot on holiday in a resort at Rhodes.  Other guests at the resort includeda glamourous socialite who was flirting with other men despite the presence of a jealous husband.  In the absence of Hastings (which would not have fitted well into the setting), Christie used another female guest to hold conversations with Poirot to flesh out the narration.  Being familiar now with Christie's sleight-of-hand tricks, I was not misdirected.  However, it took an unrevealed-before-hand witnessing of Poirot to nail the culprit when someone did die in the triangle of passion.<br />I would recommend reading the book but not buying it.	2002-10-07

But frankly, it [wasn't good] even though the graphics were passable.<br />In this story, the distinction between the Jedi and the Sith became blurred.  The stage was set for the showdown between the Jedi and the Sith, except that readers can't really tell the Jedi from the Sith.  The Sith seemed to have diminished greatly in their dark stature from Tales of the Sith etc, while the Jedi were little better than lightsaber-wielding adventurers.  The writers reduced both side to engage in purely physical combats without regards to their creeds.  The Jedi-Sith showdown became a brawl in the mud.<br />Jedis were also depicted to be indiscriminate in who they kill, and even more foolish in bringing in untrained and undisciplined children who had little sense of right and wrong into the thick of battles, exposing them to anger, hatred and fear, fuels for the dark side.<br />This is one of the worst Star Wars story, totally unfit to be part of a critical tale of the Star Wars history.	2002-10-01

Sayers narrated several entertaining mysteries.<br />Beginning with two tales of Lord Peter Whimsey, Dorothy L. Sayers played with the theme of gothic horror in The Image in the Mirror and The Incredible Elopement of Lord Peter Whimsey.  Having been forewarned though, readers were less likely to feel entertained, though these stories had excellent settings for a Twilight Zone evening.<br />The Queen's Square though, is a classic though tedious challenge for mystery readers to keep track of characters in a fancy dress party when one flirtacious young lady guest was strangled but every suspect appeared to have an alibi.<br />Necklace of Pearls would make a good holiday mystery, when a string of fine pearls went missing during a Christmas party.<br />Sayers, while supplying sufficient clues, would require readers to visual the atmospheres of parties in the 1930s, a gay affair but very formal compared to the present in the 21st century.<br />Montague Egg made his appearances in several short stories that followed, entertaining readers with various maxims for his Salesman Handbook.  First, his professional standing was called into question when one of his clients died of poisoning after drinking one of the ports purchased through Egg.<br />In another tale, Egg almost became the suspect when he discovered a potential client had thoughtlessly died before Egg could even introduce himself.<br />In yet another tale, Egg found himself playing the chivalrous role of a knight aiding a girl in distress.<br />Humourously told, Montague Egg was one excellent observer of human nature, though apparently more innocent compared to Agatha Christie's Mr Parker Pyne.<br />Two other tales rounded up the book without recurring characters. One involved a man who was told of a perfect murder through the bath, and started noticing unusual number of deaths in baths being reported.<br />Readers would quickly finished this book and want for more. Sayers did not furnish unnecessary details but managed to allow the readers feel uncheated of being narrated tales of mysteries from the 1930s era.	2002-09-19
US	52449229	R22UB6OHBGIN6Y	0312966059	711993811	Final Curtain	Books	3	1	2	N	N	From a first time Marsh reader	As a fan of Dorothy L. Sayers and Agatha Christie, I was disappointed with the beginnings in Final Curtain.  Perhaps it is because this is the first time I read Ngaio Marsh.<br />Sayers and Christie were skilled in narrating upper British class society in a very comfortable and convincing manner.  Marsh on the other hand, though her characters were supposed to be British, did not realistically convey her portrayal of the upper-class Ancred family from a native's perspectives.  In this aspect, it was unfortunate for Marsh that she was a New Zealander and a first time reader like myself would conclude that was at least partially responsible for her characters not being genuinely British enough.<br />The story began with Mrs Alleyn, nee Troy, wife of Inspector Alleyn who was one of Marsh primary detective character, being commissioned to paint a portrait of Sir Henry Ancred, an aristocrat equally proud of his background in the dramatic arts.<br />Arriving at the manor of the baronet, Troy discovered a menagerie of Andreds, by blood and by law, in a highly tensed family situation.  While tension was a familiar atmosphere in a family with most members from theatrical background, the severity increased significantly with the widowed Sir Henry being taken by third-rate actress Sonia Orrincourt, and therefore placing the inheritance of his children and grandchildren at risk.<br />Despite a series of practical pranks and family bombshells, Troy managed to complete the portrait, just before the subject was found dead several hours later.<br />No foul play was suspected at that time, and Troy resumed her life, meeting with her husband who had been away for nearly two years.  For Marsh fans, this would be a significant reunion, and Marsh did not disappoint them by being economical with the details, I suspect.<br />Shortly after that though, the focus returned to the Ancreds whom all except Sonia received anonymous letters saying the death of Sir Henry was murdered contrived bythe one who benefitted the most.  Inspector Alleyn was charged with sorting through the menagerie in the Ancred household, from the widowed daughter-in-law who kept the house, to the love-struck first cousins, to the precocious granddaughter, a wide range of colourful characters who couldn't seem to stop being dramatic off stage.<br />The mystery itself was rather disappointing.  Agatha Christie's Poirot would lament at the lack of pattern.  However, a positive point to be made was Marsh did not have her detective over-analyse the suspects as Christie was sometimes prone to do.	2002-09-17

For his own life, he wanted to write, though he had yet to sell any of his writing.<br />The novel is written from a first person's narration.  Oliver found himself at loose ends, trying to find some sense in his life even as he went gallivating to various dance halls, trying to pick up girls, at the same time earning a living until he could sell his writings.<br />He bounced from one girl to another, each different in her own way, some satisfactory, some not.  Yet for this dance hall romeo, it seemed that it was the women who taught him something instead of the other way around - that was the very element in the story that defeated its title.<br />Told as a tale of a coming of age, it ended with the young man finally finding his feet and just about to embark on his life's journey properly, or at least, with some aim in life.	2002-09-11

It was understandable that he would be half-dazed on the Thames Embankment at night when he finished his work and returned to find his girlfriend gone with all his hard earned money.  What was not understandable was he being charged with murder of a girl he just met briefly at the Embankment, escorted home and got knocked out after a drink.  His only clue was a face he saw vaguely.<br />Sentenced to life imprisonment, Matt Brady knew he was set up and planned to escape.  Serendipitously, he did not manage to escape before another prisoner was hired to kill him, thus giving him the first real solid lead when Matt persuaded the would-be killer that confession was healthy for the soul, and his body.<br />After a clever but risky escape, Matt went on to track down the people who wanted him dead, presumably the same who framed him for murder.  From one sex joint to another, Matt applied the only persuasion he had on the leads he tracked down, the fact that he had nothing to lose.<br />Though similar to The Fugitive, Higgins' novel focused more on the action of Matt Brady risking his life, foolishly walking into traps and coming out alive through sheer bravado.<br />This was a fairly short story, straight forward with little complications.  The only hitch was when Matt discovered the truth and realised that there may be no way he could ever clear himself legally - what was a man to do in such circumstances?	2002-09-04

A temporary clone spell could create the perfect alibi for any criminal.  Victims can be resurrected.  Culprits can teleport from practically anywhere and to practically anywhere.<br />Of course, the presence of magic, or technology, does not on its own exclude a murder mystery.  Isaac Asimov did it in his one of his Spacer novel \\"The Robots of Dawn\\".  The Realms Anthologies have some good short stories which could be termed as murder mysteries.<br />As Agatha Christie's Poirot once commented, a study in crime is a study of characters.  An entertaining murder mystery is not marred by technology or magic making the impossible possible, but by interaction of characters.<br />Chet Williamson appeared to be aware of this formula.  However, he fumbled rather badly in his delivery.<br />The narrator was one Jasper of Ghars, a slop-boy of halfling-human ancestry, apprenticed to retired Cormyrean war-wizard Benelaius after a failed attempt to raid the latter's home.<br />The scene was Ghars, a hardly noticable village on the Cormyrean side of the border with Sembia, soon to host the annual meeting of Grand Council of Cormyr's Merchants' Guild.<br />Somewhere in the story was a legendary headless ghost of a brigand leader who was supposed to guard his hidden loot in inhospitable marshlands.<br />It began with the discovery of the murder of an impersonator of the ghost. Then Grodoveth, King Azoun's envoy-at-large within the kingdom, was found dead.<br />Chet Williamson painted a colourful picture of a normally idyllic village beset by misfortunes on the eve of trying to make a name for itself hosting a merchants' conference.  The characters involved were diverse from money-grubbing barkeepers to lovely daughter of the local tycoon.<br />Jasper found himself assisting his portly master in the investigation.  Theirs was a contrast of methods, Jasper trying to emulate a fictional detective who employed deductive reasoning and logic to solve his crimes, and Benelaius apparently just sitting back and unhurriedly gathering his information mostly through others.  Mystery fans should recognise the caricature of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, or rather more aptly, Arthur Hastings and Hercule Poirot.<br />Unfortunately, though Chet Williamson gave a lot of attention on character interaction, he failed to negate the possibilities played by magic.  There were clues around to be sure, but they were not significantly crucial enough, and were open to alternative explanations.<br />Fortunately for Chet, his endings did tied up these loose ends, though leaving mystery fans not quite satisfied.	2002-09-02

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Original, entertaining, intriguing, challenging	This is one of the most original mystery of all times.  Agatha Christie treated the readers to not one, not two, but three deaths, each death being a very clever deception!  The final outcome is almost guaranteed to please all mystery fans.  The fourth deception is the title, which I personally thought seriously failed to convey anything meaningful to the contents.<br />During an air raid in London, World War 2, Poirot happened to overhear a Major Porter musing over a news report he just read.  Mr Gordon Cloade, rich old man and once thought to be a confirmed bachelor, had married a young girl Rosaleen shortly before being hit by enemy bombing of London.  The widow and her brother were the only people succesfully rescued, the rest of the household staff perished and Gordon Cloade did not awaken though the rescuers dug him out too.<br />Major Porter mused that he had known the first husband of Rosaleen in Africa, a colonial by the name of Robert Underhay.  The couple realised that the marriage was a mistake.  Pious Roman Catholic Underhay confided in Porter that he might do an \\"Enoch Arden\\" (in reference to Alfred Tennyson's poem of the same name), letting the world think he was dead and enabling Rosaleen to move on with her life.  Whatever the case, word came to the colonial office that Underhay died in the outbacks and later, Rosaleen had a lightning marriage with rich Gordon Cloade, only to be widowed again shortly.<br />The story moved on to a year after the end of the war and life in Britain was difficult for most people, not the least to other members of the Cloade family.  Gordon Cloade was the financial protector who had actively encouraged the other Cloades to venture out on their own, tacitly promising financial backings to pick them up if they fall or to take care of them.  The quick succession of his marriage and death meant that all his money went into a trust for his widow instead.  Though the Cloades were not parasitic, one by one, they ran into difficulties in post-war Britain, ranging from a housewife whose pre-war investments shrank, to a farmer struggling to make his farm viable, even those in the medical and legal profession had financial problems.  They might have come to terms with the apparently simple-minded Rosaleen but for her outrightly hostile brother David Hunter.<br />Things became very interesting when a man arrived in their village claiming to be Enoch Arden.  An inn's maid overheard David Hunter being blackmailed with news of Underhay still being alive.  Shortly afterwards, Enoch Arden was found murdered.<br />Agatha Christie normally provided readers with one strong highly involved enigmatic girl who was either instrumental in the plot or in providing insights, such as Elinor Carlisle in Sad Cypress, Joanna Burton in The Moving Finger, and Veronica Cray in The Hollow.  It was a rare treat in this novel that she had two such female characters: Frances Cloade, wife of Jeremy Cloade the lawyer who was determined to save her husband at all cost and show him that she loved him and had not married because he saved her father before, and Lynn Marchmont, a discharged WREN trying to decide if she still wanted to marry Rowland Cloade the farmer who stayed behind during the war to farm the land, or it was a different person she wanted.<br />Agatha Christie's female characters were always more interesting than her males, their insight, sheer determination and tenacity would quickly dispel the myth of women being the weaker sex.<br />In a true Christie style, readers were given a glimpse that each of branch of the Cloade family had something to hide.  In a novel twist, none apparently is what could usually be guessed.<br />This book ranks with one of Christie's must-read, along with Death on the Nile and Murder On The Orient Express.	2002-08-26

Harry Jackman, gunrunner in turbulent Africa, wanted out, and wanted immunity from prosecution.  His words on the last day hinted at nuclear material shipped to Islamic extremists.  With his dying breath, he pointed Sam to his daughter Julie.<br />Very few clues emerged from Julie, who was warned by Harry's last letter that the British Intelligence might find it more convenient to kill him off.  A tenuous link was made to a rogue agent from the former Eastern bloc, but the agent was notoriously hard to find.<br />Sam Packer was dealt with a double blow - Harry had threatened to expose British Intelligence involvement in a failed African coup, and exposure did come after his death, identifying Sam as the conduit.  His second blow came when it was claimed that his father, deceased Naval officer, had passed secrets to the Soviets during the Cold War.<br />However, Sam was to learn that by keeping his chin up and braving on, the seemingly unwanted cards fate dealt him could have a serendipitious effect, if he perservered.<br />The author created interesting characters through his main cast - Sam Packer who was brilliant but lecherous, Julie Jackman - neglected child with low self-esteem, and a host of other supporting cast with little foibles which made them not only seem more real, but also contributed greatly to the plot development.<br />Thankfully, unlike most conspiracist novels which had the bad guys infiltrating every govermental departmental and knowing every move the hero makes, the threat was kept at a fairly realistic level and government departments actually had a chance to show themselves as other than bumbling interference.<br />The pace picked up fairly early in the book, but the author gave some breathing space for Sam Packer to actually ponder and review his facts and to actually do some thinking.<br />The tale lacked the pounding thrill of Alistair Maclean but a lot better than the last few works of megalomaniacs such as Clive Cussler, Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum.	2002-08-23
US	52449229	R1ZGFJXECAHDOM	0425169227	108482839	Halloween Party	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Nice mystery more suited for the screen than the print	This is one of Agatha Christie's most visual mystery.  At a party, a girl was drowned in the apple-bobbing tub shortly after boasting she witnessed a murder.  The fact that she admitted she didn't know it was a murder at that time did not make her, a habitual liar, believable - but somebody apparently felt threatened enough.<br />Mrs Ariadne Oliver who was present at the party was very upset at the death, especially since it was to her, a famous mystery writer, that the dead girl Joyce was boasting to.  She enlisted the help of Hercule Poirot immediately.<br />The setting of this mystery was at a English suburb.  Agatha Christie tried to give vivid description of the place and the people, which would be the key to solving the mystery.  A beautiful garden, an elfin wisp of a girl, a small community where most people know what happened - including three mysteries from the past.  Unfortunately, she could not carry out a perfect job, and had to resort to some rather outright adjectives.<br />This was especially jarring for a murder mystery.  The challenge to the readers was not who was the culprit, but rather could Hercule Poirot unravel the thread to bring in the evidence, the motivation and bring a proper conclusion to the mystery.<br />The key would be found in the visual description - I am sure it was very clear in Agatha Christie's mind the picture she wanted to convey, but alas, her words failed to adequately expressed her ideas.  Properly done, this would have been a fantastic movie, if the producers could find the right locations.	2002-08-20

Especially after she mentioned she might have murdered someone?<br />Weaving together several subplots from her previous works, Agatha Christie tried to create a new setting for her recurrent characters: Hercule Poirot and Oliver Ariadne.<br />The Third Girl referred to a term used to advertise for a third female tenant to share the rent of a London apartment.  She was also the \\"Orhelia devoid of physical attraction\\" who insulted Hercule Poirot. It was later realised from his indignant outpouring to Oliver Ariadne that she was probably the one who recommended Poirot to this girl.<br />Thus began the mystery that might not have been a mystery. Poirot's connections to the police did not reveal any possible candidate for the murder mentioned by Norma Restarick, youthful daughter to one Andrew Restarick.  Andrew Restarick had abandoned his wife and daughter fifteen years before and left for Africa with another woman.  The deaths of his wife, then his brother, brought him back to England, with a new wife, and took over the family business.<br />Between their visits to Norma's flat and Restarick office in London, and the visit to their home in Crosshedges, Long Basing, Poirot and Ariadne composed a picture of a family challenged by the \\"revolution\\" of the 60s.  Yet there was something beyond the normal angst, and as Poirot and Ariadne continued in their pursuit, they realised there was a very real danger.  There were gossips of guns, knives and bloody stains, but no murder victim to account for; which begged the question whether Norma was guilty, innocent or insane.<br />But the questions like what was the danger, who was in danger and from whom, remained frustratingly vague, resisting most attempts of illumination. This is a departure from most detective genres and fans seeking a good old crime would be exasperated at the development of the story.<br />Nonetheless, fans of Agatha Christie would be able to garner clues if they had learned how the Queen of Mystery usually placed them subtly.<br />There were two perspectives to the deception; as a male, I uncovered the male perspective of the deception so easily that I did not realise there was a female perspective deception in place.  Certainly it was nothing to complain about for as a reader, I received my entertainment of being mystified and surprised.	2002-08-07

She was necessarily less physically active but her mind was as keen as ever.<br />The title was taken from Alfred Tennyson's the Lady of Shalot:<BR>...<br />Out flew the web and floated wide;<BR>The mirror crack'd from side to side;<BR>'The curse is come upon me,' Cried<BR>The Lady of Shalott.<BR>...<BR>It referred to the face of actress Marina Greggs, observed shortly before Heather Badcock died from drugged wine glass which was originally meant for Marina.<br />The setting was Ms Marple's village of St Mary Mead, the scene of the crime was Gossington Hall, the very same mansion in which a previous death was discovered many years before in the novel The Body In The Library.  The Hall had passed through several hands since the Bantrys in the earlier novel.  In this novel, it was just renovated by the new owners; film director Jason Rudd and his wife Marina Greggs.  Marina Greggs was making a comeback after several years of recovering from a breakdown due to giving birth to a mentally deficient child.<br />On the day of the crime, Gossington Hall was venue to a local fete and there were numerous visitors.  Ms Marple herself however, did not appear at the Hall until much later.  However, she was informed of the events and interviews by many other people, some like local \\"gossip\\" of Mrs Bantry her old friend and Ms Knight her companion, others more official like Chief Inspector Dermot Craddock who apparently continued to hold enormous respect for Ms Marple's insight.  Readers were not always told the specific words given to Ms Marple, but they were given first hand accounts of the interviews.<br />Several crucial clues weregiven in very subtle manner but they would only be meaningful to readers who did not start on the wrong premises.  I was fortunate enough to bring with me the skepticism developed as a mystery fan not to take anything at face value and hence I was able to come to the conclusion pretty fast.  That however did not diminish the pleasure I derived from reading the book.<br />Another aspect which made this novel interesting was Agatha Christie introduced new types of characters, or at least characters with fresh and different portrayals.  One of her maxim was either a study of the victim, or a study of the crime, or a study of the culprit, would reveal all.  Readers could use 2 of the above to solve the crime for themselves.	2002-07-31

Did Jack Higgins think he was designing a computer game with progressive scenarios and cut scenes of tete-a-tete between the heroes and the villains between scenarios?<br />The premise of the story was this: a union of the a Mid-Eastern tribe and a Scottish noble family produced the Rashid-Daunceys, financially rich, ambitious and aristocratic from long traditions.  Family motto \\"I Always Return\\".<br />All the male scions of the family graduated Stanhurst, with the eldest, Paul, serving in the Gulf War and Northern Ireland.  Post Gulf War, they concentrated their efforts to monopolise control of the oil production in their native Bedu.  Enter American-Russian consortium intent on bypassing the Rashids, involving some failed assassination attempt on Paul.  An unfortunate accident also killed their mother, coincidentally involving a Russian representative of the consortium.<br />It was from here that the plot began to become ridiculous.  Granted that their Arabic blood (and Scottish as well) demanded some revenge, but Paul chose the assassination of the US president to make a warning against messing with the Bedu, never mind that the president Jake Cavalet was acknowledged as a decent guy who was not involved.<br />The first big question was: even if they could assassinate Jake Cavalet, how would the world know it was for messing with the Bedu?  And if the Bedu or the Rashids claimed the kill, what would be left of the Bedu or the Rashids after the outraged Americans were done with their vengeance?  Frederick Forsyth's Day of the Jackal had the assassin carefully planning his moves, erasing his tracks and maintaining his anonymity, intending on permanent retirement in the aftermath.  In contrast, Higgins' plotters talked like they accepted such deals every second Tuesday of the month.<br />The failed attempt of Jake Cavalet (no thanks to dismal security), and capture of one of the assassins, leaked the entire plot to the president, his advisor Blake Johnson, and through a connection with Sean Dillon, the British PM and MG Ferguson of Group 4.  This was where the ridiculousness was brought to a new height - they did nothing except to watch the Rashids and try to catch the Rashids at the next attempt.  Had there been no surviving witnesses, the authorities might not have been able to do anything.  But enough evidence was present to confirm the Rashids involvement, and instead of bringing the very expensive agencies, the US and UK leaders took the passive role.  The Rashids swaggered through town with impunity after failing to kill the US president and left one of the assassins to be captured alive; this was where the book lost its credibility altogether.<br />The rest of the book had Sean Dillon playing cat-and-mouse game with the Rashids, except that they could not agree who was to be mouse and who was to be the cat.<br />Jack Higgins tried to make this a little different from his previous Dillon-is-the-hero book by introducing two sidekicks for him; former London gangsters; one of whom the readers were repeatedly reminded of how many times he was imprisoned, and Jack also took out policewoman Hannah Bernstein, having her wounded and confined to the hospital.  However, instead of making this book fresh or different, the scenes became trite with cliche conversations and reactions from the characters.<br />Though the locations moved across the world from UK to US to the Bedu's Hazar in the Middle East, there was nothing meaningful significance about each scene.  In the end, it concluded with Paul Rashid telling his sister Kate that he wanted to continue the game with Dillon because it gave him more kick than earning another billion.  The charaters in this book could hardly be less cardboard-like.<br />The epilogue ended with Kate Rashid, still a free (and bloody rich) woman, despite being clearly and personallyinvolved in the plots, promising vengeance on Ferguson, Dillon & Co., all in a cozy bar just like the British commenting on the weather.  The hint of the sequel did not hold much promise, Jack Higgins had better realise how awful this book was before he became condemned permanently as a has-been.  He ought to re-study his previous books like Cold Harbour, the Eagle had landed and A Game for Heroes to rediscover the human element which made his book so good.	2002-07-30
US	52449229	R2WGE4WYQNLDB6	0786901195	414482987	Once Around the Realms (Forgotten Realms)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	This is a FUN book, read it as such	I suppose it would be inevitable given the nature of the Realms and some of its writers that an attempt would be made at such a parody.  The Forgotten Realms has more than its share of jokers compared to Greyhawk, only recently &quot;lightened up&quot; by Paul Kidd, or Dragonlance (okay, you can't take kenders seriously, but they aren't really funny if they weren't kenders, if you know what I mean.)  From Danilo Thann by Elaine Cunningham, to Giogi Wyvernspur &amp; Olive Ruskettle created by Kate Novak and Jeff Grubb, to the various cast of the short-lived comic series - crew of the Realm Master, centaur heroes of Waterdeep and of course, Maskar Wands, the Forgotten Realms has somehow a strong element Wodehouse humour which fitted right in amidst the Elminsters, the Zhentarims and Cyrics.<br />It was only a matter of time before someone in TSR thought of &quot;Around the world in 80 days&quot; and the realms was the perfect setting for it; since it had the undisputable candidate who was just perfect for the job: Volothamp Geddarm, author of Lonely Planet of Toril.  The fact there was already published an Atlas for the Forgotten Realms was probably an added bonus.<br />It must have been a difficult choice of places and people to include, but I suppose the author must have done all right not to get killed by other authors for not including their respective pet characters - no, I'm not mentioning who were left out.<br />Anyway, the story needed a premise, or to put it another way, the author needed a good reason to send Volo around the world.  In the absence of the Reform Club in the realms (I suppose the Stalwart Club would do too, but they did not really have a readily recognisable character with such inclinations), the author had Volo goaded into the challenge by Khelben.<br />Of course, a Passpout had to be included, and since the name was so recognisable, Brian Thomsen didn't bother to play around with it very much.  Together, the intrepid travellers, or at least,one intrepid traveller and his reluctant sidekick (notice Passpout didn't change very much), sought to cover the world ASAP.  Which was not soon enough for Volo when he discovered the pact he made somehow interfered with his magical abilities.<br />Always the veteran traveller, Volo though sought out every opportunity to hasten his journey, always on the look out for alternative modes of transport.<br />Along the way, besides picking up a couple of fellow travellers, they encounter a variety of characters from the realms (such as Drizzt) and out of the realms; i.e., characters from other fictions reprising their cameo roles.  What was fun for people who read widely was spotting these characters, like spotting &quot;Where's Wally?&quot;.  Read it and see if you can find characters from Les Miserables (Victor Hugo), Count of Monte Cristor (Alexander Dumas), Around the world in 80 days (Jules Verne if course, gotta pay a tribute to him who inspired this book), and others.<br />Oh, of course, like the journey of Phileas Fogg, there is something *sinister* involved as well, you know, just to add a little more fun into it.	2002-07-22

These have got nothing to do with crimes.<br />A couple of other stories such as the Blue Jar have some crime involved, and could be considered readable.<br />What mystery and crime readers would normally expect from Agatha Christie was a thorough investigation of the paranormal, sifting the clues and evidence, and exhaust all possibilities before leaving it as ... unexplainable by known facts.

Don't ask who is Martin Hussey, that name never appeared in the book at all.  Upon investigation, he came across a name of the Iraqi tank driver, Khalid, who appeared to possess extraordinary \\"good luck\\" which kept his tank from being obliterated.<br />At the same time, a savant English girl demonstrated some interesting capabilities which intrigued a writer for a British science magazine.<br />Both the tank driver and the English girl became target for the ruthless Max Shannon who sought to duplicate their prowess, even if it meant killing them in the process.<br />The writer made some research into paranormal studies done, and offered some insight into certain scientific, or pseudo-scientific, perspective into the functioning of the universe.<br />However, he made bad errors in using Uri Geller as a subject.  According to information found the website for CSICOP, Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, in 1994, Uri Geller's libel suit filed in 1992 against Prometheus Books was dismissed with Uri Geller being required to pay for the costs.  Prometheus Books had published \\"Physics and Psychics\\" which denied Uri Geller's claim to psychic prowess and revealed them as tricks.<br />Other than that though, it was rather entertaining except for the ending epilogue which left the picture rather ambiguous.	2002-07-18

But it is not, and to appreciate or understand this novel, readers must place it in the proper context.<br />The problem was at first vague; Ariadne Oliver was asked by a stranger if the mother of Ariadne's goddaughter killed the father, or was it vice-versa.  The deaths were actually some twenty years or more before.  As the stranger was the mother to a man who was contemplating marriage to Ariadne's goddaughter, she could be partially forgiven for her apparent concern.  Of course one of the things Ariadne did was to call on Hercule Poirot, and together they embarked on elephant-chase to pry for secrets from the past.<br />&quot;Elephants can remember&quot; was published in 1972, that is 52 years after the first Poirot novel &quot;The Mysterious Affairs at Styles&quot;.  Many people did not even live that long.  Agatha Christie aged her characters along with the years, and therefore there were cases that were different from bodies being found all over the place.<br />Other similar novels before this whereby Christie's detectives investigate deaths long in the past included Dumb Witness, Five Little Pigs, Mrs McGinty's Dead, Ordeal By Innocence, and Nemesis.  The common theme among them was that the investigator(s) had to depend on memories of various people who might not even be present; but from their recollections, clues were found to provide either the definitive picture of the culprits or the definitive picture of the crime.  What a lot of impatient readers would find irritating was having to sift through the useful information from the useless.  Elephants is such another tale.<br />Mystery veterans would probably have been able to jump to the solution before Poirot's grand finale, but would they have been able to unravel the threads in the manner necessary?  Proofs have to be gathered, and evidence, motivation, etc were all the necessary persuasions for Elephants before they would give up their secrets.<br />The meat and drink of this novel is more than solving the mystery of who killed who, but to recapture the atmosphere, the mood, the aura of that time in the past, and to be able to put events in their proper perspectives.  Also no less important was Poirot's being able to relate the past (in its correct perspective) and its impact on the present in order for persuade the elephants to give up their secrets.	2002-07-17
US	52449229	R15YIUKOWN1PIU	0312981643	274606132	They Came to Baghdad	Books	3	6	8	N	N	A spy thriller genre set in the style of a children�s book	In a theme similar to some of her other works, namely the Big Four, the Secret Adversary, Destination Unknown and Seven Dials Mystery, Agatha Christie moved away from familiar settings of a murder/crime investigation within a confined setting to the global stage for an international conspiracy that sought to manipulate the 2 world powers in 1950.  Such conspiracies were the favourite of writers like Robert Ludlum, fleshed out with all the dirt, cynicism and playing hardball, gratuouis sex and violence and profanity liberally sprinkled.<br />Fortunately, or unfortunately, Christie's descriptions tend to be milder, child-like (or childish if you prefer) even.  Bringing out a theme which she used a few times in other similar novels, the writer sought to try her hand into the realm of grand-scale conspiracy, extensive penetration of government officers by spies, huge amount of money movement camouflaged in indescripherable financial transaction, and missing scientists brought to a secret remote base far from civilisation.<br />The readers were treated to a prologue scene where a couple of British agents were worried about a conference among the Great Powers to be conducted in Baghdad soon.  Their man who had on a rumour gone off in pursuit of evidence of the conspiracy was on the way back but the path is hindered by people who sought to silence him and the evidence at all costs.<br />The scene officially opened with Victoria Jones, orphaned, typical working girl in a London office whose only escape from her dreary existence was inventing juicy tales, the type of juiciness that could only come from the subject being related to familiar characters, such as her boss.  Thus when her boss returned early unexpectedly, Victoria Jones found herself shortly munching her lunch in FitzJames Garden, considering her externally imposed career revision.<br />Not the type of girl to let such things depress her, Victoria Jones found herself attracted to a man sitting nearby.  Boldly introducing herself to him, Edward charmed her by the simplistic way he reflected on life, universe and everything, probably very much like what Wodehouse's Bertram Wooster would say in candid guiless moments.  After Edward took a snapshot of her before rushing off back to his boss, letting out that he was bound for Baghdad the following day, it took Victoria Jones all of a minute or so before deciding she too would go to Baghdad, with her exchequer being of a respectable sum of five pounds, or so.<br />With the kind of serendipitous encounters that could only happen in the movies & PG Wodehouse, Victoria Jones made her way Baghdad, a comfortable trip, legal and all without stowing away like rats on a ship, and with just a bit of the madcap hare-brained (yet undeniably successful) schemes that PG Wodehouse put his poor heroines through.  Victoria had to through becoming several different people before arriving in the Middle East and finding Edward.  The encounters she had in her journey would serve to provide her with the information later she would need when she found herself involved in the BIG conspiracy.<br />For a change, her first involvement was not due to any of her doing.  A man simply got into her room, begged for sanctuary like the room was the Church of Notre Dame in Paris, then most inconsiderately, died.  A nearby British agent quickly assisted her through the crisis, and Victoria Jones found herself off in search for clues at the Olive Branch, a literary society where Edward was employed.<br />The mystery deepened when Victoria Jones was kidnapped at the arrangement of a colleague who was just as besotted with Edward. Though she was just an amateur blundering in the dark, Victoria showed herself no less resourceful by escaping, taking on more identities before returning to the Baghdad.<br />Readers can't help but admire her quick-thinking and acting skills when she finally discovered that the truth was ...<br />For its merits, readers would have to consider this book as being about Victoria Jones and how she handled herself through sticky situations, instead of viewing this as a mystery or a thriller.	2002-07-01

Poirot could not lose a client he never had, nor was there a witness, dumb or otherwise.<br />Nonetheless, it was an interesting story - Poirot received a letter more than a month after the writer died, written just days before the demise.  The writer had not mentioned the problem except her having suspicions after the incident of the dog's ball, and need utmost discretion to protect the family name.<br />Upon arrival at the Littlegreen House in Market Basing, Poirot and Hastings learned that the late Ms Arundell changed her will right before her passing and left everything (except gifts to servants) to her none-too-brilliant companion Ms Lawson, denying her only relatives, 2 nieces and 1 nephew, even a single penny.<br />Here, we saw Hastings mortified by Poirot's employment of deceptions in gathering information from various people in Market Basing.  A familiar reader would find that odd, wouldn't a long-time companion of Poirot be familiar with his un-Englishness approach to problem solving?<br />The characters involved were interesting, but not very colourful. One dowdy niece married a charming Greek doctor, practically a scandal in the insular society.  Another led a fast life in London, then inexplicably got engaged to a pedantic country doctor who seemed more interested in his research than her.  The nephew was generally acknowledged as an incorrigible rascal, charming, but not to be trusted.  Last but not least, the suddenly wealthy Ms Lawson who had an unhealthy interest in spiritualism.<br />The sharp-eyed Poirot immediately deduced the truth of the incident of the dog's ball which prompted Ms Arundell to write the letter.  He felt he had enough justification to continue his investigation despite all signs to Ms Arundell dying not to foul play.  This was a well-done tale, true to Poirot's formula - study the murder, and you would find the murderer.<br />There is also aninteresting part in the book looking through the eyes of a dog.	2002-06-26

The unsuspecting sister returned to England with her daughter, just in time for the girl to start in Meadowbanks, an élite girls school, where a female cousin (& fiance) of the deposed prince, was also arranged to attend.<br />Several interested parties had been on the prowl searching for the gems, the pilot's efforts had not been as clandestine as he had hoped.  With new girls, new teachers, and also a new young handsome male gardener, was it a wonder that some residents of Meadowbanks felt as if there was a hidden cat among the pigeons.<br />Agatha Christie painted an excellent picture of an English public school going about its daily business.  There were staff as well as students who were trying to get use to a new environment.  There was a headmistress, who having successfully established the school according to her vision after years of struggle, was considering passing the torch to the next generation.  There were old faithfuls among the staff who were less prominent but had heard and seen much of what others missed.<BR>Meadowbanks was probably Agatha Christie's of what an ideal school should be like.<br />Having got the background set, Agatha Christie got down to business with the first murder, the victim being a rather unpopular new staff in the recently completed Sports Pavilion.  Readers would have been given enough outright hints before this as to what would be of interest in the Sports Pavilion.  The object of the mystery quickly turned from recovery of the gems to the discovery of the murderer.<br />Midway, a second murder almost threw the investigators off-track, and a third murder was committed before Hercule Poirot who was called in late in the game seriously got down to business.<br />Mystery readers could find little fault in way which the authorities set abouttrying to find the culprit, but it took bringing back a student's mother from Anatolia to trap the murderer.<br />All the while, Christie managed to maintain a light hearted atmosphere despite the deaths in the story, with occassional injection of humour and wit.  She included important and interesting roles for the diverse characters from students to faculty to police to parents in how the mystery was played out.  This is truly one of her most readable book.	2002-06-24

The French authorities, represented by the rivalling local magistrate and Parisian detective, jumped on a series of clues thoughtfully left behind to assist their investigation, but could not agree on the verdict.  Meanwhile, Poirot did his own investigation, drawing attention to clues which neither the French and Poirot's companion Hastings could not imagine any significance of.<br />The mystery was cleverly thought out.  However, Christie failed to tie up loose ends, several of the deductions made by Poirot in the middle of the story were inexplicably ignored and forgotten at the unravelling of the case, causing certain inconsistencies.<br />The primary significance of this book though was on how Hastings got his girl.

While both threads were properly developed in their own right, their intertwining was almost accidental and had no element of a plot at all.<br />The author planned well the series of events which gave the readers an intimate insight into the character of the druid hero. He did not do so well with the villain Borran, readers were left guessing to Borran's actual motivations.<br />There were numerous references to events in the From the Sea trilogy by the same author, I guess Mel Odom just couldn't resist.  Though there was *some* connection, the repetition just gets on the nerves after a while.<br />As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the author appeared to find too little pages to do justice to the climax after a skillful build-up which took 262 pages (the book had 311).  The element of intrigue deftly introduced by Allis, the liason officer assigned to Borran Klosk by shadowy masterminds working behind the scenes, simply evaporated.  It could have been put to better use, the additional pages would have been justified by a stronger storyline.<br />While I have no real complaints about the hero and the villain having only *one* showdown, it was brilliantly done and flowed very well with the story (who needs recurring encounters anyway), I was rather disappointed that it did not bear any significant impact on the hero; emotionally, intellectually or otherwise.	2002-06-19

As a reward for their thwarting attempted raids, the castellan tasked them with hunting down bandits and what-nots that threatened the security of the region.<br />This novel is obviously not about high-level adventurers, which was fine in itself 'cos I get bored with high-level fancy stuff like Elminster casting a spell to detect all but the most powerful enemies from the safety of his lair.  Eddis and Blorys had to get down and dirty, going through hostile wilderness to search out the lairs of the raiders, and wipe them out.<br />But the boring part was that for most of the book, they did not encounter anything that posed serious threats, and they could go on fight after fight against superior numbers.<br />There was a little attempt made to characterisation and PC interaction, but the basic simplicity of the plot (to rid the raiders) sort of made it rather unexciting.<br />What could have made the book much better was instead of finishing abruptly, an analysis of the impact of the clean-up on the Borderlands to be presented. <br />On the whole, fine for beginners, yawners for others.	2002-06-18

It had a feather on its head, a needle of a sword and it stood on its hindlegs.  This book deserved better attention, unlike blood and gore and cynical world weariness which seemed to pervade most fantasy books today.<br />Mus of Kerbridge is almost like one of Grimm's or Han Christian Anderson's fairy tales - of knights and castles, ladies and love, magic abound and courage renowned.<br />In a magical world which was not named, centaurs, humans, satyrs and harpies dwelt together within the same kingdoms.  A political intrigue led to an accident which created another sentient race - the mouse of which Mus was the first.  Mus was forced to infiltrate the chamber of Miriam, a centaur lady.  Turning against his tormentor, and swore to protect his lady.<br />As war threatened the kingdom, Mus became the source of inspiration to battle-weary soldiers to rally against the invaders.<br />This book is very much written to relate to children, but cynical adults could learn a lot from it, if only to open themselves to the possibility of beauty and kindness.<BR>Paul Kidd managed to re-create the fantasy feeling of childhood days in an expanded puss-in-boots fantasy.	2002-06-17

Meanwhile, the SIS agent in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, and those investigating in London, found clues that this was more than a mere publicity stunt by Kutuans.

Somehow, her picture of what the house should look like after renovations coincided with exactly how the house used to look like.  Even scarier, she could picture a strangled woman in the hall and knew her name was Helen.  Yet, there never was a murder reported in the region for ages.<br />Enter Ms Marple who guessed Gwen might possibly have spent time in the house as a very young child and might possibly have witnessed a murder.  But how would one go about solving a murder twenty years before which had no prior record?  How would the Reeds start when they were both newly migrated to England?<br />Ms Marple's advise to let sleeping murder lie went unheeded by the young couple.  Somewhere, there was a murderer who committed the perfect, almost perfect, crime and had been probably been comforted by the years of safety.

These fans would be disappointed.<br />The book Theros Ironfeld dealt with the protagonist as a boy volunteering to join the minotaurs when the latter raided his coastal village home.  It depicted a lonely boy whose mother died and was unloved by his father, yearning to find a place for himself in the world.<br />There was a lot of promise in the beginning for the boy who won personal recognition from the god of the minotaur Sargas for his sense of honor.  From the minotaurs, Theros learned the skills of a weapons and arms maker, equipping him for his destiny.<br />However, the story went downhill from there.  Freed from slavery by the minotaurs for his personal honor and loyalty, Theros went knocking around Ansalon, from Sanction all the way to Solace over many many years.  A few things of interest happened, I would leave the readers to discover those for themselves, which are supposed to shape the mind and character of Theros.<br />However, while the events were exciting, they were not lived to the potential and frankly, quite anti-climatic.  Encounters which began with promising sparks simply fizzled out as Theros turned his back on the road less travelled and seemed bent on shutting himself personally from the world, concerning himself with nothing else but setting up a forge and dooming himself to a mundane life.<br />Readers would have thought that Theros' personal contacts with the minotaurs, Solamnic Knights and Baron Dargon Moorgoth would play significant roles later in his life but nothing doing, Don Perrin seemed to be intent on just planting theseeds which readers would never see to bloom.<br />The ending was rather abrupt, Sargas behaved in a rather uncharacteristic manner which would leave DL fans disappointed at the quickness the author chose to end the book.<br />BTW, Theros was never a gladiator under the minotaurs, nor was he ever a soldier nor chose to follow Paladine.  Then again, his story in this book seemed different from those in DL gamebooks too.	2002-04-30

What improvement???<BR>To hormone-charged adolescent, Dirk Pitt is the ultimate G-Guy.<BR>To critics, Cussler has put Pitt on the ultimate pedestal from<BR>which there is no meaningful challenge left.<BR>Fortunately, all these has changed in Valhalla Rising.<br />But to begin at the beginning, should a book review consider the<BR>merits of the book on its own, or should it be considered in the<BR>light of the previous books in the same series.  This is a tough<BR>question, and it would not be fair to be dogmatic either way.<BR>A more meaningful way would be to try to achieve a balance of<BR>both.<br />Clive Cussler's formula of integrating historical events into<BR>significant impact into the present day is a good formula.  A<BR>sense of being something more than \\"just a modern-day anomaly\\"<BR>is introduced, the anomaly being a big baddy waiting to be<BR>taken down.  New readers would get a sense of being shown just<BR>a glimpse of something which is part of a very much larger picture.<br />While Cussler repeated that formula in Valhalla Rising, this time<BR>incorporating Norsemen ventures into Northern America in the 11th<BR>century, followed by a \\"Captain Nemo and the Nautilus\\" in the 19th century.  In his previous adventures, historical events seldom have gone beyond mere historical significance awaiting discovery into scientific significance, but this time it did.<br />There was a shift in the villains through the history of Dirk Pitt adventures from political foes (internal and external) to corporate megalomaniacs.  The only problem about this is if they are part of a series, surely these evil corporate overlord-wanna-be would have stumbled over each other in infiltrating the government and staking their claims.  But to make the story interesting, it could not of course be allowed to happen, and hence the sense of continuity in Dirk Pitt's adventures is never established.<br />Thus has been the problem with recent Pitt's stories that one wonder why I said this book has major improvement.<br />Well, the improvement lies in the characterisation.<br />Dirk Pitt has descended from superman into a more normal fellow.<BR>He gets tired, he no longer can beat Mike Tyson single-handedly, and he makes deductive (not intuitive) mistakes, he no longer try<BR>to bed attractive women, but shows certain loyalty to his long-time friend Congresswoman Loren Smith.  And also, towards the<BR>end of the book, his age showed with a definite stamp.<br />Another major change is villains are no longer all-pervasive and completely shielded by anonymity, private armies and more layers of defences than Bin-Laden.  There was no final assault on the<BR>ultimate fortress.<br />More time was also given to the supporting characters, besides the usual suspects.<br />Of course, it was disappointing to see how easily the baddies could take out the normal cops, Cussler should make them more than cannon fodder.<br />Nonetheless, more return to realism, less glamour and more brainwork put into writing novels by Cussler is a welcome move.  Authors get to get megalomaniac over their heroes, like Tom Clancy's.  It might be good for them to change to new characters and story lines to develop new perspectives, and when they return to their old characters, they bring refreshing innovations.	2002-04-28

Next was the elderly widow Lady Tressilian, matron of Gull's Point.<br />Rounding up the usual suspects, we have Neville Strange, young, rich, semi-pro sportsman; his second wife Kay, a glamorous hothead from the Riviera; his divorced first wife Audrey, a complete contrast in character to Kay, stately, willowy and dignified; Thomas Royde, family friend on home visit from Malaya, devoted to Audrey for years; Edward Latimer, friend to and similarly devoted to Kay; Mary Adlin, Lady Tressilian's companion and manager of the household; plus an assortment of domestic help.<br />Did Kay kill Lady Tresslian, thinking she would be the beneficiary to the legacy as wife of Neville Strange?  Especially when Neville declared he intended to divorce her to get Audrey back.<br />Was Audrey the culprit, knowing she was the actual beneficiacry, being the wife of Neville when the will was drawn up, mentioned in name specifically?<br />Or was it Neville, to thwart Lady Tresillian's objections to his divorcing Kay to get Audrey?  Much as Lady Tresillian disliked his first divorce and his second wife and as much as she liked Audrey, she disapproved of his irresponsible behaviour.<br />Or perhaps it was Edward, confidante to Kay, who thought of doing her a favour by securing her an inheritance.<br />Or even Mary, who could be a repressed woman.<br />Slowly, possible motives and opportunities emerged for the suspects.  Inspector Battle who had to cut short his trip found himself applying the lessons he learned from his daughter and from Hercule Poirot to detect the fiendishly cunning traps set by the murderer.<br />It was one of the more difficult puzzles created by Christie.  While readers may be justified in feeling upset when characters narration were purposely withheld from them, enough clues and hints and omens were given in the book to point them to the culprit.<br />It would take a patient and careful reader to pick up all the clues and be able to see the final light when the last piece of the puzzle was revealed.	2002-03-08

The similarities between certain key characters are striking, both are supposed to be idyllic rural havens with very laid back lords of the manors, both suffered plagues of chaos determined to put its stamp on them, and both also suffered from energetic young girls pining for action.  There is also a bit of courtship and marriage proposals prevalent in Wodehouse novels.  And not forgetting the insufferably competent secretaries.<br />There however, the similarity ended.  Whereas Wodehouse was anything but seriously humourous, Christie was humourously serious.<br />A party of young men and women, idle rich, who were guesting at Chimneys, embarked on a practical joke to launch 8 alarm clocks on their Rip-van-Winkle friend Jerry Wade.  The joke turned sour when Jerry was discovered dead in bed the next morning, and only seven clocks were found, arranged neatly from their original locations.<br />Bundle, daughter of the manor's lord, found an unfinished letter written by Jerry which suggested sinister forces at work in relation to his death.  The significance of the reference in the letter to the \\"Seven Dials\\"  was confirmed later when she came across Ronny, (one of the guests engaged in the practical joke,) dying of gunshot wound.  His last words referred to the Seven Dials and to Jimmy, yet another party to the alarm clock prank.<br />To a girl yearning for adventure, it seemed to her her desire was practically forced upon her.  Bundle proved herself resourceful, investigating staff in her own household, throwing in together with Jimmy and Lorraine Wade (Jerry's sister) to investigate the mysterious deaths.<br />Reprising his role as the chief representative of the law was Superintendent Battle. Bundle was acquaintted with him in an earlier Agatha Christie's novel \\"Secret of Chimneys\\".  Through him, she found the lead to the Seven Dials Club via Bill Eversleigh, also a repeat character from Secret of Chimneys.<br />Soon, Bundle found herself in the middle of an international conspiracy, from eavesdropping on a secret society while hidden in a cupboard, to rubbing shoulders with foreign dignitaries in a diplomat party hosted by George Lomax, the insufferable bore from the Foreign Office (also from Secret of Chimneys).  She discovered that an innovative technological breakthrough was the target among local business enterprises and commercial espionage.<br />Here, we saw Agatha Christie being naive in understanding of science and technology.  Her description reflects those of children's stories were important discoveries could be recorded in several sheets of \\"secret papers\\", of which only one copy in the world existed, handled carelessly in the studies of private residence.  This happened not only in Seven Dials but also in several other of her mysteries.<br />Overlooking that, Seven Dials was a great romantic adventure thriller set in the romantic era of the 20s where young women were gaining confidence in the area of action.	2002-02-20

Especially Agatha Christie's.  In several of her novels, she had the investigators looking into a murder that did not exist, a person that did not exist, a motive that did not exist and many other red herrings.<br />Hence, when the good Rev Stephen Babbington died during a party thrown by retired actor Sir Charles Cartwright, none of the guests present appeared to be who they were supposed to be.  There was no motive, nothing was left to show the death was a criminal act.<br />Some time later, Dr Strange who was also a guest at the party died, this time, the nicotine poisoning was clear.<br />Told primarily from the perspective of Sir Charles Cartwright, his friend Mr Satterwaithte, and modern girl \\"Egg\\" Hermione Lytton Gore, Hercule Poirot took the passive role most of the story.  The other three went about gathering clues, examining scenes of the crime and interviewing the usual suspects.<br />The only problem with such an approach could be revealed by one of Christie's favourite dogma : people do not tell what they saw or heard, they tell what they thought they saw or heard.<br />In many instances, it was merely written Sir Charles, Mr Satterwaithe and Egg reported what had happened to Poirot rather than describing the words they used to convey the information to Poirot.  Therein lies one of the weakness of this book.<br />A second weakness of the book was some of the offstage investigation work done by Poirot was not revealed to the readers.  In stories where the clues for opportunities and accessories were (subtly) evident, motive was not as vital for the readers to correctly guess the solution.  However, this story was weak in all but the opportunities department.  Only the camouflaged opportunities was masterfully done by Christie for both deaths, requiring people to consider things in the opposite of the conventional direction.	2002-02-15

So hailed of Ms Marple by Mr Rafiel, eccentric wealthy old man who was to feature in a later Agatha Christie mystery titled \\"Nemesis\\".  To readers of this review, I mention this because I read Nemesis before this book and therefore could easily eliminate several characters from the list of potential suspects.<br />Ms Marple's brain could not rest even though she was supposed to be on vacation in a beautiful Caribbean resort, courtesy of her nephew Raymond.  Just the day before, the retired Major Palgrave was yakking away to her his life experiences, the following day, he was found dead in his room.  The verdict was heart attack, which Ms Marple found strange as the major had no history of heart problems.  Or could it be related to the photograph of a murderer whom he was about to show her but changed his mind hastily?<br />Though set in the tropical West Indies, the background was quite incidental, similar to a number of Christie's other tales set in exotic locations.  A failing of Christie in these books was to cause the rich background to fade to near obscurity.  Perhaps this was her method to train the focus of the readers to the characters, underlining the customary emphasis of Hercule Poirot and Ms Marple that to understand a murder, one must look into the people, their character and their interpersonal interaction.  While a legitimate claim, nevertheless, such an approach would render the titles of these books near to the category of false or misleading advertisement.<br />Another disconcerting feature of the book was the readers were offered many glimpses of happenings not available to Ms Marple.  Thus while the clues were in abundance to the readers, they were not supposed to be so to Ms Marple.  However, Christie revealed some of these information to Ms Marple in almost a ridiculous manner, female gossip.<br />As an avid reader of her mystery book, I pit my armchair detective prowess against the array of pieces presented and my correctly deducing the answers were not as satisfactory as I considered this one of the less hard mystery.  The pattern is clearly discernible, one just needs to know where to look.	2002-02-14

He and his modern sister Joanna took a lease on a house, Little Furze, whose owner had been forced to let out due to financial needs.<br />At first, the village appeared perfect.  It was certainly small enough that the Burtons got to know a number of notable locals who were to play prominent roles in the nasty affair to follow.<br />There was the village pastor who appeared to be more a scholar than a shepherd, and his wife who made people she could see right into their souls.<br />There was Owen Griffith, the local doctor, and his sister Aimee, the alpha female with boundless energy.<br />There was Richard Symington, the lawyer, who had two sons and an enigmatic step-daughter from his wife's previous marriage.<br />There was also Elise Holland, whose appearance sent Jerry Burton to the skies and whose voice brought him crashing down to earth.<br />Perhaps it was traditional provincial animosity towards outsiders, Joanna received a poison pen letter soon after their arrival.  But later they realised they were not the only ones.  Various other ladies also received one.  Strangely, though there were authentic materials available, the writer of the letters chose to fabricate the accusations.<br />The recepients tried to ignore or deny the letters until one day, Mrs Symington, wife of the local lawyer, apparently poisoned herself with one such letter found nearby.<br />Shortly after that, her maid was found murdered.<br />As the progress of the police appeared slow, the pastor's wife called in Ms Jane Marple.  Using the subconscious observations of an outsider, Jerry Burton, she pieced the truth and ferreted the real culprit out.<br />The writing of this novel is excellent.  Again, Agatha Christie managed to vividly desribed the personalitiesand interpersonal interactions of various characters to subtly build a background to a murder, without the whole picture being obvious.  She also gave a lively description of a bucolic small village scene, making it interesting even to those who had no real interest in being personally involved such rustic settings.<br />The only flaw I could detect was in the evidence, the typewriter identified used in the crime.  Due to certain timings of the recepients getting the letters, the poison pen writer should not have been able to use the typewriter in the described manner to send one of the letters.	2002-02-11

To add insult to injury, another passenger of the flight, Hercule Poirot who had slept through the incident, found the blowpipe stuffed behind his seat.<br />The flight was not full, and the victim sat alone.  The list of suspect was immediately produced - in the rows in front of the victim, there was the businessman James Ryder, the mystery writer Clancy, the dentist Norman Gale and a hairdresser Jane Grey, across the aisle from the victim sat two French nationals; a Dupont father and son team of archeologist, a Harley Street doctor who played a flute sat next to Poirot, and two society ladies who parried each other bitchily.  The two stewards who had served the compartments were included but quickly dismissed as suspects.<br />The clue to the murderer was to be found in the belongings of the suspects listed by the police as requested by Poirot, but being a mystery fan, I had zoomed in immediately on a most logical but errornous clue.<br />The writer contrasted the methods of the police, as represented by Inspector Japp, to that of Poirot.  While Japp &quot;measured footprints and looked for dropped clues&quot;, Poirot sat back tried to determine the murderer from the profile of the victim.  Several possible motives became apparent, Ms Giselle was a rich French moneylender who encouraged her multi-national clients to pay up by possession of secrets her clients could not afford to have publicised.  She lived alone, leaving her fortune to an only daughter whom she left with an orphanage at a very young age.  That was after she became disfigured in her face and chose to pursue a non-traditional lifestyle, distancing herself but not completely cutting off ties with her family.<br />Poirot was able to perceive clues where the British and French police failed.  From dealing with the lower classes (being a private citizen), to interacting with other suspects (being a suspect himself), he was able to glean out certain details which appeared to be of no significance, but when put together, clarifies the entire picture properly.<br />Having read a number of her books, I thought myself more familiar with the era of her stories, learning the customs etc, and I pit myself against Christie to put together her clues before it was revealed in her story.  I did not win often, and this is another such instance.  Can you do better?	2002-02-08
US	52449229	R2D21PQY0OJZBF	0880389052	243097701	Homeland (Forgotten Realms)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	One of the best FR books ever	Re-reading Homeland after the first time five years ago brought back much memories.  Undoubtedly, some of Salvatore's best works were in his earlier periods.<br />When the book came out, Drizzt was already a familiar character to to readers of FR novels, having been introduced in the Icewind Dale Trilogy - Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver and The Halfling's Gem.  His combat skills with the twin scimitars were already well documented, as well as his faithful friend the magical panther Guenhwyar.<br />In Homeland, Salvatore attempted to explain the origins of how a drow, traditionally enemy of the surface world, came to be a defender of the weak and upholding justice in the realms.  He began with societal description of Menzoberranzan, a mighty drow city where Drizzt's natural family resided as one of the stronger noble clans.  Through a combination of macro and micro view of interaction between the drow clans, Salvatore depicted a society where the strongest rule, not only among families, but also within.<br />Born to a world dedicated to Lloth the Spider Queen, where everything is permissible (except being caught) to further personal benefit, Salvatore showed how a unique combination circumstances shielded the young drow noble was shielded from the despoiling influence of his society until he was sufficiently strengthened physically and emotionally to face the stark truths of everything around him.<br />Throughout the theme, Salvatore dictated a furious pace of the progress of the young Drizzt through his formative years, learning his place as a page, a warrior trainee and a student in the drow academy where inter-student rivalries were literally deadly, before Drizzt finally took his place as a fully fledged male noble in his clan.<br />At intervals, there would be a page or two of personal contemplation of Drizzt on his Menzoberranzan years, the lessons he learned, and re-learned upon the benefits of hindsights. These musings serve as an interesting read to readers, allowing them to bring their own mullings to pace with Drizzt's developments.  This, is one of the better parts of the book, which overall is an excellent piece of reading.	2002-01-25

The map which led them there brought them to the site of an ancient ruin from an era bygone.<BR>At the end of the first book, the landing party had been savagely assaulted by strange mechanical devices and subsequently separated from each other.  Their ship was also ambushed by the Ilse Witch and taken over.  The book had concluded with the first face to face meeting between Bek Ohmsford, heir to the Wishsong, and the Ilse Witch, who was also his long-lost siser Grianne Ohmsford, the only other living wielder of the Ohmsford legacy, the Wishsong.<br />The book Antrax has several separate, sometimes intertwining, threads running at the same time, which is similar to Tolkien's the Two Towers.  Bek Ohmsford found himself trying to convince the Ilse Witch that she had been duped by the Mograwr and most of her life was a lie.  Truls, the shapeshifter, fought hard to keep him alive and help Bek gain better control over his nascent prowess of the Wishsong when Grianne disbelieved him.  Finally, Bek decided that he had to make Grianne face the truth, and allow himself to be \\"captured\\" by her.<br />Bek's childhood friend Quentin Leah, along with several elven Trackers, had been separated from Walker in the ambush in the ruins. With Tamis and Panax, they encountered a strange race of natives, the first sign of sentient settlers in that land. The natives had been hiding from the inhabitant of the ruins which they called Antrax.  Recovering from their ordeal in the native village, the party learned that Antrax had been sending out mechanical moving machines to kidnap the villagers, disasssembling them and reassembling into part machine part flesh creatures.  Quentin and company learned the truth of this when they saw Ard Partnell, an elven warrior who had fallen in the first ambush, being sent after them.  Quentin learned thehard way of dealing with these machines.<br />Ahren, the unwanted elven prince, found himself cowering during the ambush.  Shamed by his cowardice, he unwillingly escorted Rye Ord Star the seeress to enter the ruins in search of Walker. Unknown to him, both of them were weighed down by guilt of their own betrayals.  Somehow, each must find a way to redeem himself and herself from the past.<br />Walker, who knew more about the supposed treasure than he admitted, found himself in a nightmare where an unknown being was siphoning off his magic. He finally realized the truth about Antrax later, and realized that the fabulous treasure could help or destroy the future of the world, and the choice fell on him!<BR>Unable this time to let the people make their own choice, as previous Druids had done, Walker, for the first time, had to make the choice on behalf of the world.<br />A refreshing change in this book from previous books, Brooks as well as non-Brooks, was that the dialogue was more mature.  Characters were less narrow-minded and could actually reason things out themselves. The success of Brooks in this case was that he could make them no less distinctive as individuals, each with his/her own sets of fears, hopes and dreams.<br />The background revealed so far was the Antrax was a legacy from an era prior to the Great Wars which obliterated civilisations, wiping out technological achievements of the world. With the mission to protect the libraries of knowledge, Antrax evolved somehow a need to gain more energy and sought this from the magical sources of the Four Lands, which had forgotten technology and had developed magic in its place.<br />The ending of the book was somehow unsatisfying, with cliffhangers for each development thread. For readers who got the book early, the waiting is simply killing.	2002-01-24

A couple of days before his retirement, Paul Chavasse was approached by a Tibetan monk requesting information on an extremely classified operation he had carried out in 1962, smuggling a brilliant mathematician out of communist Chinese occupied Tibet.<br />As he recalled his adventure, readers would see Paul Chavasse, who had 3 years before successfully smuggled the Dalai Lama out of Tibet, return in order to extract a 70-year old sickly mathematician.  His mission almost ended the moment it began, running into a group of Chinese soldiers and Russian journalist who happened to be passing by as he landed in the remote wilderness of Tibet.  His mission was made even harder with the presence of a beautiful Russian house helper Katya in the home of the mathematician, and the relentless diabolically shrewd Colonel Li, commander of the regional Chinese garrison.<br />Betrayal, torture, deception met Chavasse at every turn.  How was he going to return with a sickly geriatric over such long distances of inhospitable terrain at Himalayan altitudes ?<br />Readers may not get a treat of how harshly beautiful Tibet is, but there is no shortage of excitement as Chavasse fought to remain true to his mission.  Unlike other books where the adversaries are depicted rather one-dimensionally, Colonel Li posed as a most worthy foe, Jack Higgins being able to portray him as having realistic mind of his own.	2002-01-16

Watching over the pair was Fendel, a gnomish tinker priest of Gond.<br />While on the run from the Purple Masks, Lhasa crossed paths (and more) with Corin.  The latter had bankrupted himself after two years of unsuccessfully trying to restore his sword arm at the Temple of the Morninglord.  Somehow, though drunk most of the time, he managed to keep himself in good shape enough to tackle a patrol of the Maces, the ruthless enforcers of order in the city.  Lhasa persuaded him to be her bodyguard, holding out the hope that her mentor Fendel would be able to provide him with prosthetic arm.<br />To finance the replacement arm, and to flee from the Masks, Lhasa took on a dangerous assignment, not knowing it was from a traitor who betrayed the White Shields two years before.  Corin and Lhasa soon found themselves embroiled in an underworld war between the Cult of the Dragon and an shadowy independent syndicate led by someone known only as Xiliath.  Xiliath's top lieutenant Graal was the one who had taken Corin's arm.<br />No stilted dialogue, excessive self-pity or tedious passages, this book went right into the action.  Both Lhasa and Corin acted well for their situations, and no wasteful time nor words that would make the readers feel impatient with the characters.<br />The book also gave a good introduction to Eversult, which had not been covered in any other FR novels - a city built by smugglers, highlighting its unique flavour, distinguishing it from being just another city with underground mazes.	2002-01-09

There were really multiple personalities in the tale rather than figureboard mouthpieces of the author.<br />That is why there was a Mr Rafiel, eccentric wealthy man who charged Nemesis, which was what he called Ms Marple, to set out on a quest to right a certain wrong.  In his will, read after his death, Ms Marple was left 20,000 pounds if she would take up his charge.  He left no explicit instruction for her, other than referred to the only time they had met, when together they solved a murder.<br />Not one to idle, Ms Marple went forth enthusiastically to learn all she could of the late Mr Rafiel to find out if he had anything unfulfilled in his life.<br />Next, she was contacted by a tour agency informing her that Mr Rafiel had pre-booked her on a tour of old English houses and gardens.  On the tour, she met various personalities, of which two revealed themselves to have links with the late Mr Rafiel.<br />In due time, Ms Marple learned of several noteworthy things which had happened in a little village - vicious murder of a girl engaged to the son of Mr Rafiel, conviction of the latter for the death, another missing girl, three sisters who had brought the girl up and also well acquainted with the late Mr Rafiel.<br />Little by little, Ms Marple learned more about the people around her, and it was from their personalities and characters she determined the kind of persons they were and what they might and might not have done.  Alert for danger, Ms Marple sought to assemble disparate pieces of information to uncover a hidden picture of what could have happened which would be of interest to Mr Rafiel.<br />I found that having read several of Christie's mysteries, the trend was easy to spot, and being alert for the red herrings, found them fairly easy to spot.  However, it would still offer a challenge to those who enjoy reading mysteries which gave clues through relationship of people rather than clues in the forms of dropped matchsticks etc.	2002-01-08

How were the persons of Blunt, a most influential figure in the world of British finance who remained largely in the background ?  Or the rebellious Raikes who was in love with the niece of Blunt ?  Or the retired civil servant Barnes ?  Or the mysterious missionary lady Seale who inexplicable went missing soon after?<br />Red herrings abound in this story, with numerous twists and turns.  The time interval was long, with weeks or more passing between chapters, making one marvel at how Poirot managed to keep the right focus on the murder even though he must have attended to numerous other affairs in the meantime.<br />Unhappily, when all was revealed, what the book lacked was a credible motive for the murder of the dentist.  Given the resources available to and the intellect of the culprit, the killing seemed most unnecessary.	2002-01-03

Thus it was with Star Wars, it is the same with Harry Potter.<br />I read the book with great relish, having been a fan of Enid Blyton in my younger days, I recognised many of the characters appearing in the story having parallels to other such school days stories written nearly a century before.  There would be bullies, there would be those who lack confidence, there would be the smug, the wastrel, the showoff etc., and almost as many varieties of the faculty.  The magic was merely a tool, a decor, a setting, and another of making the readers to cease taking things for granted.<br />Rowling had probably borrowed ideas not only from Blyton's stories, but also from R Dahl, notice the various goody treats the students can get and compare them with Charlie and the chocolate factory.<br />Being able to cast spells is no big deal if every other person can learn to do so too.  Pranksters in the real world learnt to do the same using knowledge gained from chemistry classes, physics class and just a lot of imagination.  In fact, in Enid Blyton's school stories, the students had access to devices not available to their teachers, which is not the same in Hogswart.<br />There are dark elements in the story, instances of bloodiness etc, but these serve to warn that magic, even in fiction, is not without terrible consequences.<br />Ultimately, the book is just pure fun to read.  It is certainly not meant to be a Christian message, but it does not deserve more blame for leading children astray any more than superhero comics or star wars movies.	2001-12-11

Movie stars, insurance agents, beautiful women all combined to produce volatile tension when an abandoned plane was discovered in the middle of nowhere with 2 dead bodies.  A supposed griefing widow, an overly solicitious insurance agent, Joe discovered that greed can rear its ugly head in the most unexpected quarters.<br />In a fashion, this book followed the style of Alistair Maclean when the narrator described everything that he saw, heard and felt, but refrained from revealing all the knowledge available.<BR>A good mix of mystery and turns, even if the excitement of the wilderness and artic aviation failed to rouse you, the superb drama between lively characters, with all the human failings and foibles would serve to delight and entertain, making this book hard to put down.	2001-12-10

Hercule Poirot was engaged to clear up his death, sixteen years after the incident, by the daughter of the victim, and to establish the innocence of the accused, her mother, who had died shortly after the crime<br />Amyas' wife, Caroline Crale, had been indicted by the court for poisoning him, and though much of public, and private sympathies of the witnesses, were for her, only her beloved sister Angela Warren believed her innocence.  Angela had been disfigured by a jealous Caroline when she was young, but the pig who cried all the way home grew to a mature confident modern woman who established herself firmly in the archaeological circles.  Due to her youth, and eagerness of Caroline to spare her public scrutiny, she was the only &quot;pig&quot; not called to the witness stand at the trial.<br />Her governess, Ms Cecilia Williams, was then, and still was at the time of the novel, unencumbered by material possessions, the pig who had none.  Ms Williams had sympathised strongly with Caroline who had to put up with her husband's philandering ways and eccentric temperament, not believing for a moment being an artist was a license to do as one pleased.<br />The cause of the apparent conflict between the victim and the accused was the rich girl Elsa Greer, the pig who had roast beef. The household had come to known while Elsa was being painted by Amyas that the latter intended to divorce Caroline and marry Elsa.  <br />The source of the poison was to have come from the neighbouring estate's laboratory owned by Meredith Blake, an amateur herbalist.  As heir and successor to the estate, he was the pig who stayed at home, in contrast with his younger brother, Philip, who went to the (stock) market and made his fortune.  The Blakes had grown up with Amyas and Caroline since childhood, and remained on close terms with them after Amyas and Caroline married.<br />Sixteen years after the affair, upon coming of age, the daughter of Amyas and Caroline returned to Britain from Canada where she had been fostered out.  She had, along with her inheritance, received a posthumous letter from her mother stating her innocence.  Eager to clear the dark cloud in her life, Poirot was engaged to seek the truth.<br />After preliminary interviews with the legal and law personnels involved in the case, Poirot concentrated his attention on the &quot;five little pigs&quot;.  As most of the book was a recounting from various perspective presented by the witnesses, it had been categorically divided into sections catering for each witness.  This was unlike other Christie's books where the author narrated events as they were unfolding, with many conversations and actions of various parties intermingling.<br />As warned by the police officer interviewed, Poirot obtained five different scenarios from the people, but incredibly, he managed to uncover layers after layers of deception.<br />Towards the end, Poirot recalled all witnesses and the daughter of Caroline, also named Caroline.  He presented to them what really happened, and clarified what appeared to be misunderstandings left over the years.  It was a surprising revelation of the truth, though most mystery fans would have been able to uncover the first level, the actual truth was surprising indeed.<br />The only thing that was unsatisfactory was that throughout the build up of the story, readers would expect the actual culprit to be properly punished, and that did not happen.	2001-12-01

Hastings, part-time sidekick to Poirot, is back and the tale is narrated through his eyes.<br />Hercule Poirot faced an international syndicate known only the Big Four, composed of a French, an American, a Chinese and a mysterious figure known only as the Destroyer who was a human chameleon.<br />They came across several subplots of the Four which was bent on world domination.  At their arsenal were secret weapons which can wipe out an entire fleet of destroyers etc.  On the more insidious part, they can incite world unrest, financial crisis and social instability, such as the Russian revolution.<br />Unfortunately, Christie did not give proper credit to an organisation which possessed such prowess.  Instead, all Poirot had to deal with was minor subplots of the Big Four, such as kidnapping of an English scientist in France, death of Russian nobility, following a trail of murders of people purportedly having some inside knowledge of the Four.<br />In each case, the tale was a brilliant piece of detecting.<br />Unfortunately, there was nothing to tie the pieces together.  Nor was there any explanation for what knowledge these victims could possibly possess to threaten the Four.  Nothing was given to explain the real aim of the Four, nor the resources at its disposal.<br />The story ended literally with a big bang in order not to have to explain anything else.<br />Big bad organisation existed, big bad organisation went up in a boom.  This was very disappointing.	2001-11-28

While this book is definitely an original Christie's, it is hardly a vintage.<br />Writing from the perspective of the vicar of St Mary Mead village where Ms Jane Marple lived, the writer unfolded a scene of a little village's usual &quot;transquility&quot; being disturbed by an outsider in the form of Mr Lawrence Redding, an artist who drew various local ladies.  One of the ladies was Griselda, wife of the vicar, and another was Anne, second wife to a not generally loved Colonel Protheroe, the latter being a murder victim found in the study of the vicar.<br />Rounding up the usual suspects, there was the victim's daughter, Lettice, nearly as old as her stepmother and hated the latter utterly, a ne'er-do-well local by the name of Archer who was jailed by the late Colonel who happened to be on the bench, plus a mysterious Mrs Lestrange, a recent reticent arrival to the village.<br />Instead of treating the readers to a conventional detective story, the writer described everything from the eyes of the vicar, a possible suspect himself if not for a cast-iron alibi, he had been calling on one of his flocks. The narrator attempted to clear the mystery himself, unsatisfied with the effectiveness of the investigating police officer, a certain Inspector Slack. Together with the local doctor Haydock, they spoke to almost everyone imaginable in the village, trying to reconstructing the truth from various perspective.<br />As a detective novel, it did not help that the star sleuth Ms Marple was herself a witness, her residence being right next to the vicarage.  Readers would get a feeling that they are not being treated fairly in terms of the information being provided, depending instead on evaluations provided by Ms Marple.<br />Several red herrings of course were thrown in, which made the story more life-like. As the investigation proceeded, new clues were revealed which oft led the amateur sleuths on wild goose chases.  It was only when they returned to re-examine the sceneof the crime that the truth finally came to light.<br />Readers who loved mysteries would find nothing to complain about, except that they had been led on a wrong trail and for most of the book, missed out on the real mystery.	2001-11-15

There is no who-done-it, though<BR>there are few clues left around, there is no crime actually defined.<br />Scientists from the West have gone missing.  When the wife of one such scientist went on a holiday, supposedly to recover from the trauma, British agents had her tailed, suspecting she could lead them to the whereabouts of the missing scientists.  But when her plane crashed and she was seriously injured, the trail appeared to go cold.  Enter Hilary Craven, a suicidal woman who bore a passing resemblance.  Offered a more exciting way to die in an almost certainly fatal missiong, she eagerly took the chance.<br />Not knowing what she could expect to find, the British agents could brief her little except to play-it-by-ear.  As they hoped, she was accepted as the supposed wife, and led to be with her supposed husband.  But as closely as the British agents trailed her, the adversary was a step ahead to outsmart the shadowers and Hilary found herself in an unexpected place, with even more unexpected encounters.<br />Would she survive, or would she be exposed as an impostor?  The strangely diverse people she had for travelling companions on her way to the lair of the enemy made her wonder if the whole business was what it really appeared to be.<br />In Hilary, the writer had a perfect character for such a mission, a person who had no desire for self preservation, and could mold herself into another being who had a dual purpose in life, one as a impostor wife, another as an undercover agent.<BR>To paraphrase a line from a popular song, when she fooled the others, she fooled herself as well and through the ordeal, she actually became the force which pushed others to cling on to hope, and eventually, regaining her sense and purpose of existence.<br />A highly enjoyable book, in the cast of adolescent adventure but written for adults.	2001-11-12

Here, the author appeared at one point to be revelling in writing about the exaggerated formalities and pomp of trying a peer that it seemed to be her climax and that the case was just an excuse to write about it.<br />To be fair, she did write about a nice case.<BR>The case itself, which appreared to be another who-dun-it murder, introduced many side plotlines.  As in real life, most of the time, a person finds himself in numerous roles that often when something like a murder mystery occured, most writers neglect all other aspects of the person and present only the relevant ones.  This author however, had managed to present the different roles a character has in &quot;real-life&quot; without falling into a rambling trap.<br />Certainly for a fan of hard-core detective novels, this book may be rather disappointing in its conclusion.  However, taken as a novel, it provided an interesting glimpse into the British aristocratic society and its interaction with other parts of society as a whole.<br />Except for the conversational language used, Peter Whimsey could have been substituted by a certain Belgian detective and the entire novel would have appeared as a Christie's.	2001-11-01

A rogue, Kestrel, found herself inexplicably drawn into a quest in Myth Drannor to liberate the corrupted Mythal from a dracolich and its gang.<br />Strangely, while Elminster appeared in the background as the patron, he did not despatch more powerful adventurers even though he should be aware of the critical nature of the situation.<br />As story-telling goes, the writer made good use of newly introduced characters and gave them enough of &quot;role-playing&quot; such that their backgrounds were gradually fleshed out with consistency and sensibility.  A paladin, a fighter, a mage and a rogue started out as strangers to each other, gated to Myth Drannor to pick up on a quest from a fallen group sent previously by Elminster.  Like a computer game, they meet the easier foes first, gradually learning more about their quest, clues to the solution, and even found a sanctuary amidst the ruins of Myth Drannor to recuperate from their wounds.  They even get to get new members as the story develops.<br />The author did it in a simple and straight forward manner, lending several twists customary to an RPG.  Unlike traditional novels, this one took it from the computer game, without narrating any part from the adversary's point of view.  The baddies were just there, having sprung from nowhere, with enough firepower to drive off the phaerimms and baazetus etc from Myth Drannor, but just careless enough to be taken by a small group of mid-level adventurers.

But then, this is Greyhawk, not Forgotten Realms or<BR>Dragonlance.<br />However, breaking Enid from the afterlife was just a tad too much.<br />Otherwise, it is a rather interesting book, with realisitic development between characters, romance, seduction, anger, possessiveness, honour and what-nots.  The author gave a good account of Justicar's past and his recognition of the flaws of his previous mentor Recca.  Romance between human and sphinx is a new avenue, but so far, little words were used as judiciously possible, after all, what can a teenager say to an all-wise sphinx?  Even Cinders have some development of its own, learning several suprising tricks.<br />While readers would enjoy the characterisation, veterans would feel cheated by the less than titanic battle between the rangers' band and the queen of the demonweb pit.	2001-10-30

Oh, and of course the proliferation of trashy adventure thrillers also helped spark off their imagination; few glamourous adventure heroines suffered from sea-sickness or the availability of dashing boyfriends always there for them.<br />When Anne, an orphaned English young lady, witnessed a death in the London tube, she found herself drawn into a real adventure without any clues to what she was really going after.  All she had were vague clues that she had seen the &quot;man in the brown suit&quot;, who was known to be present at two apparently unrelated deaths, one being the supposed accident at the tube, another was a strangled woman in the house belonging to an English MP Sir Eustace Pedler.<br />Finding herself on board a cruise to South Africa, Anne found the web of intrigue expanded to include several more persona dramatis; the events seemed to surround these people whom all appear to be totally legitimate.<br />Slowly, she learned that the affair was somehow related to one of the most daring diamond theft that occurred years ago, to a mysterious criminal organisation led by a shadowy mastermind known only as the Colonel, and with the luck of the British, she only got a couple of attempts on her life.  Of course, just to make things a little bit more interesting, she found herself drawn to a man who personally declared he would strangle women with his bare hands.<br />Although the background of South Africa had certain significance to the plot, like the attitudes of most colonials of the time, the native colour and people were relegated far to the background.	2001-09-26

The obvious suspect, the woman jilted by the victim's husband, had a cast-iron alibi; the jilted woman just shot the victim's husband.<br />On board were other colourful secretive characters, not a few could have a reason to want the victim dead.  Also on board was Poirot who was determined to get to the truth, if for no other reason, that he was sleeping right through the murder!<br />Diverse clues were found throughout the book, a great deal given before the murder took place.  Agatha Christie unhurriedly built up the backgrounds of the characters in the book such that doubts can be cast on everyone but none could be suspect.  Her portrayal of an intelligent woman jilted, a beautiful heiress born with a silver spoon, idealistic cynic, hypochondriac dame etc were interesting, insightful and most descriptive.  Readers would find their personal responses to betrayal, persecution and temptation etc elicited from the various cast.<br />The only fly in the ointment was that Egypt as the setting was relegated too far in the background.  Ancient curses and scheming natives may be passe but one can't help but feel that the ancient Nile put up but a superficial appearance.	2001-09-26

A fair number of legitimate cases unrelated to the spies came their way, and the two played the game by pretending to be famous fictious detectives, including Father Brown (creation of GK Chesterton) and Sherlock Holmes (creation of Arthur Conan Doyle).  They solved the cases with more than an element of fun, typical husband-wife oneupmanship, female intuition etc.<br />While entertaining, the backdrop of the detective agency being a Trojan horse for counter-intelligence was rather naive and unrealistic.  It presumed the Russians did not know the faces of the English traitors they recruited, and once the trap was exposed, they would prefer to spring it rather than leave it alone.	2001-09-11

Now, at the age of fifty, married with two children, Webb decided to put an end to Carlos once and for all in order not to have to keep looking out for a shot in the dark.  He knew that Carlos was also impatient, being older, ill and having little time to gain the level of recognition long denied.<br />In the pursuit of their hunt, David Webb and Alex Conklin created a ghost from the legend of Medusa, only to find the ghost becoming real!  Finding two major adversaries instead of one did not detract David's attention on Carlos, and he allowed the CIA to focus on the Medusa, only to find the Medusa zoning in on his family closer than he could have imagined.<br />The hunt which started from the USA, carried on to the Caribbean, to Europe and finally, the Soviet Union where the Jackal had been trained.<br />In this novel, more sides to David, Marie (his wife), Alex and Panov were revealed.  Some are logical, having 13 years passed since the Bourne Identity, the characters have matured without losing their personalities.  Others are annoying, such as David being so obsessed with his prey he wilfully ignored other dangers such as the Medusa.<br />More interesting characters were introduced, but they were restricted largely to the first or the second half of the book.  The good thing is secondary characters were not cardboard figures but with humanly plausible characteristics such as the Soviet's agents David had to work with.  The annoying thing is many of them &quot;disappeared&quot; without proper accounting to their fate.<br />The main question posed in the beginning of the book, who leakedthe identities of Conklin and Panov to the Jackal, was not resolved and totally forgotten.<br />The ending could have been satisfactory too if not for the last paragraph which left the readers in limbo.	2001-07-05

But in xenophobic Chinese dominant environments, Jason Bourne would have stuck out as a sore thumb and would never have been able to camouflage himself from Chinese who hunt him.<br />That aside, the author's Chinese translations were atrocious.  He was savvy enough to know the people spoke mainly Cantonese in Hong Kong, but Mandarin is usually only spoken well in the north of China.  Some of his swearings and curses were laughable.  For example, no Chinese would use &quot;Dong Wu&quot; to curse someone as animals, because &quot;Dong Wu&quot; had no such connotation.  Instead, they would use &quot;Cu Sheng&quot; or &quot;Qin Shou&quot; (meaning brutes, or beasts).<br />The author should have researched more carefully, and get native Chinese-ethics for input and feedback.	2001-06-28

The man, with unremarkable appearances, found himself marked for death by unseen enemies.  Using skills he never realized he had, he raced across Europe, leaving a bloody trail of deaths.  Millions of dollars are somehow involved, with different people pursuing him for different reasons.  Along the way, he found assistance from the least expected source ...<br />The author did well in several things about this book:<br />The phasings - The book consisted of several phases, with the first phase being the unidentitied person fished out of waters and taken to a small port in southern France. There, he was nursed physically and mentally back to health by an English doctor.  The doctor played the part of the readers, acting out their more common suggestions on how to regain the identity of the amnesiac man without going to the authorities.  Readers who wondered about why the authorities were kept out received a plausible explanation.  However, it is a pity that no more is heard from the doctor for the rest of the book.  He was the more interesting character in this part of the book.<br />Next, having regained his strength and some measure of confidence, plus a bit of control over his emotions, the mysterious man set off to Zurich.  There, he found a city which had known him, or known of him.  He also found himself recognised and targetted to be killed.  It was in this part of the book more of his skills surfacing, not only in self-defence in physical contact, but also self-preservation.<br />The pace of the book picked up from Zurich as more names from the man's past emerged : Jason Bourne, Carlos, Treadstone, New York, and Cain ...  Also, somewhere in his memories are remembrance of assassinations.  Bourne, as the man realised he was known as, had to find out what role he had in the killings and the money, before he was killed.  More and more parties emerged who wanted to neutralise him.<br />As the story travels across Europe, the book entered different phases, each distinct, with the mysterious man changing, evolving or rather, the man who was his past emerging.  Though the book is long, there is no repetition of plots as the man desperate sought for and followed clues after clues to his past. The irony which would have struck the readers was that the action of the man so thoroughly confounded his opponents, though it was the action of a man who couldn't remember, the very actions saved him several times from their traps.<br />Finally, it was only in the last phase that the identity of the man was revealed to readers, who could not have guessed the twist.  Unfortunately for him, his main opposition had also been busy severing his past so that he had nothing to return to.<br />Readers were left wondering how the tale would turn out.  It was rather disappointing as readers would feel that loose ends were left unattended, unaccounted.  At least, within this book.<br />The man created by Ludlum was an excellent piece of work, who would win the readers' sympathies.  Action thrilling paragraphs were also interspersed with contemplations without pointless ramblings, a failing of many thrillers which tried to take themselves too seriously.<br />Definitely a worthwhile read.	2001-06-04

In Nazi thrillers, the professional honourable gentleman German officer usually have Prussian ancestry and has to deal with powerful rabid SS maniacs.  If they come to blows, the SS always shoots first.<br />2. Women who despaired of life and went into nunnery are always beautiful and unable to completely severe their ties to the mortal world.<br />3. Tarot card readings are way more accurate than scientific projections.<br />Sounds familiar?  Perhaps with movie blockbusters today, all movie-goers would be familiar with the inexplanable facts of life but remember folks, you read it first in the books, one of those books being Higgin's Luciano's Luck.<br />The unusual title is more unusual considering the central character of the story is not really Luciano, a big-time American mafia who was convicted on a bum rap.  As the invasion of Sicily looms, the Allies desperately sought the compliance of the Mafia to reduce casualties and win over the Italian troops weary of Il Duce Mussolini.  The most widely respected figure in Sicily was of course not the local governor nor the Italian generals nor the German commanders but the illusive Don Antonio, the capo of capos in Sicily.  On his word, the whole island would rally behind the Allies, &quot;encouraging&quot; Italian troops to cease resistance and provide passage over inhospitable terrain from the landing beaches to Palermo.<br />But Don Antonio disliked the Americans, just a little less than the Nazis.  Only his estranged granddaughter, the Sister Maria, and the famous Sicilian American &quot;homeboy-made-good&quot; Luciano had any hope to gaining the ear of the Don.<br />Harry Carter who slipped in and out of Sicily countless times found himself saddled with the two &quot;persuaders&quot;, dropping into enemy held territories, where not all Sicilians greeted their arrival with full enthusiasm.<br />At the core of the matter, no one reallyknew how Don Antonio thought, and whether the mission was futile in the first place.<br />Characterisation wise, there was a good range provided, from shepherds to soldiers to airmen.  Higgins played out the full range of human emotions, from love to hate, jealousy to bitterness, pride and prejudices.  It was a drama of humanity as much as gunfights and subterfuge.<br />With additional work, Higgins could have made the book longer and even more interesting.  But it was tricky, and the wrong move could kill the potential of a better book.  Maybe he was right to quit while everything was still in place.	2001-05-23

Beneath the normally jovial relaxing surface are strong undercurrents that each member of the party knows that things are not what they seem - one or more among their number knows a deadly secret and threatens to expose it or utilise it for self-gain.  The CIA operation recruited John Tanner to expose Omega, a Soviet mole who holds numerous influential people in the US hostage.  Omega has a time-table when he will squeeze these hostages to do as he bid, resulting in financial, social and economic catasthrophe in the Western world.<br />Action is seen much through the eyes of John Tanner, a man trapped by the CIA, who has no choice but to see his family at risk to catch the Omega.<br />But Omega seems to be on the game, leaving a bloody trail of hints and attempts on Tanner's family.<br />The good thing about this novel is you never know where the author will take you next, the twists and turns are more of classical mysteries rather than a thriller.<br />Ludlum did a fair job, but he could have done better if he had concentrated more on the suspense and leaving of clues.  Instead, he gave the settings and characters of a mystery, the plot of a &quot;save-the-free-world&quot; thriller, and the between both worlds, he was unable to maintain a proper pace in either.	2001-05-22

A trail of dead bodies marked his passing as he grasped the flimiest clue that would led him from one place to another.  Certainly, it was the better part of the novel where reader can admire the tenacity and brilliance of the would-be-retired-agent.<br />The later part of the book tracked the conspiracy to its source, but this part is less well-written as convoluted details were rambled and readers get lost in data overload.  Also, Michael's jogging through his memories became more confusing for readers.<br />Character wise, there was little to be criticised, though dialogues were a little stilted.  But otherwise, each character was clearly distinguishable with a fair degree of realism.  Twists in characters could not be anticipated but were introduced brilliantly.  The only complaint was readers today could tell if someone calls to say he's got vital info that could not be communicatedimmediately or needs more confirmation, something bad is sure to happen to ensure the communication would not take place.  But to be fair, that is after countless movies and thrillers today, and should not be judged on a book that was written long ago before it became a common ploy.<br />Everything points to an explosive ending and it was almost anticlimatic when it did end though.  On the other hand, I suppose no one would really expect an all-out nuclear war.	2001-05-13

No one in the Kremlin wants the last possibility to happen, so two factions emerged, with the bare majority, including the Secretary-General, advocating negotiation.  Through a Kremlin informant for British agent Adam Munro, the British PM and the US President learned just how desperate the situation in the USSR was.<br />Meanwhile, the survivor of a shipwreck in the Mediterranean aroused the interest of a British Andrew Drake.  Drake descended from a Ukrainian nationlist, whose mission in life was to strike a humiliating blow against the USSR, and the shipwreck survivor provided him with an opportunity to do just that.<br />Somehow, the different threads spun by the author in the book came together, climaxing with the world being held hostage to an all-out war between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, or the greatest environmental catasthrophy yet.<br />The author did not stint on fleshing out his characters, providing them with ample description, motivations and attributes that the reader can just imagine the kind of actors and actresses that would be cast if this was a movie.<br />Plot development were fast and furious sometimes, yet deliberately slow and detailed at others, paced out well like the different variations of a symphony, but never a dull moment.<br />In the end, it will be up to our hero Adam Munro to save the world from the various catasthrophies, and the numerous twists in the end came round a blind corner, hitting the readers where they least expect (unless of course, they've been reading way too much thrillers like me who managed to guess a couple of them).	2001-05-11

The job consisted of infiltrating the IRA, posing as an arms dealer, locate a shipment of gold stolen by the IRA to be used as the war-chest, neutralise the threat of a certain Michael Cork who masterminded the heist.<br />The development is anything but.  From the start, it was a game of deadly deception between the G-men and the IRAs, not just one, but 2 competing factions.  Simon found Michael Cork too cautious to get near, and had to deal through the latter's niece Norah, a Harvard-trained doctor who had seen too much death, and her bodyguard Binnie, still believing in an honourable war.  Frank Barry, leader of the rival IRA faction, also wants the gold, and the arms, and seems to shadow Simon and his group at every step.<br />Through their conversation, readers cannot help but feel sad at the state of affairs - it had definitely gone beyond where any side can claim higher moral grounds, yet it cannot seem to stop or the victims might just lose any cause to go on living with their pain.  Almost everyone has a decent reason for what they do, whether it be the IRA or the British government.  And almost everyone has their hand in some unforgivable misdeed.<br />Higgins set out to write from his personal experiences and of those around him and he succeeded in describing the situation as a no-win for anyone but pain for everyone.  It was also a warning against simplifying the heroes and the villains, but also to focus on the real victims, people who had to live with the bombings and shootings while simply trying to lead a normal live.	2001-05-03

I reserve 5 stars for classics like &quot;The Eagle has landed&quot;, but this book comes close. There are plenty of twists and turns and unlike repetitive characters of Higgins, you wonder when a major character in this book will get bumped off the next page.<br />Sarah Talbot and Sean Egan came from 2 different world, an ex-SAS from London East End who had to quit due to a knee injury, and a Wall Street terror whom Washington bigwigs queue to kiss her hand.  But they have one thing in common, people they love had died under strange circumstances and the corpses to smuggle heroin.<br />Ferguson of Group 4 (in this book, Harry instead of Charles, wonder if they are one and the same), Tony Villiers, another intel officer, knew it was linked to some sensitive issues and made no open inquiry, effectively denying official investigation.<br />But Sarah Talbot and Sean Egan had no such burdens and vowed to discover the truth and the mastermind behind the tragic deaths of their loved ones.<br />It was interesting as the bad guys found out early in the game they had crossed powerful people and tried desperately to stay ahead, denying Sarah and Sean information without killing the two bereaved.  Sarah carried an aura of protection due to her political connections to the White House, and Sean used his underworld connections to get clues and leads, his uncle being Jack Shelley, an infamous London gangster.<br />Their adversary was one ex-para named Jago who works for the mysterious Mr Smith.  One by one, Jago sought to eliminate the links from the 2 bodies but Sarah and Sean just managed to gain a little clue each time before their links were terminated abruptly.<br />From London, to Paris, to Sicily, to Ireland, the trail finally leads back to the shadowy streets of London East End where the mysterious Mr Smith is unmasked.<br />Higgins gave a good description of the trial by fire of Sarah who was determined to step into a different world, of murder and mayhem and lawlessness(illegal ones, not the legal kind in Wall Street). Readers could actually see that it is one thing to be incensed by the murder of a beloved, it is quite another to go out to the streets seeking revenge.<br />This is definitely one of Higgins' better books, where the reader is kept in suspense and the action was fast and furious but not mindlessly so, with each chapter providing clues and hints and kept essential to the development.	2001-05-02

Keeping himself anonymous and working only with 2 greed-motivated underlings, Manson sought out a notable mercenary leader Cat Shannon who just returned from an unsuccessful mission from Africa.<br />Unwilling to be pawn to an unseen mastermind, Shannon initiated his own counter-espionage to learn more about his paymaster and the interest in the apparently insignificant African state.  To add spice to the game, the Russians, who had the major influence in the state, also learned that a British survey completed several months before in the Crystal Mountains which reported no significant tin deposits (the original object of the survey) may not have been completely truthful ...<br />The start of the tale focus on the cat-and-mouse game Manson and his underlings played to keep their discovery a secret while trying to launch a military takeover, finding the suitable men to fight and another to be the puppet head.  The middle of the tale looks at the mercenary acquiring, financing and transporting the necessary hardware from various sources in Europe.  The narration is well-detailed, showing for the right price, anything can be bought from the street hoodlums or from the your own government.<br />Manson and his underlings were well-constructed, appearing to be more mercenary than the soldiers of fortune. Shannon, on the other hand, a man who after his earlier African experiences could not adapt to a cog-in-the-wheel life in civilised Britain, showed such sharp mettle and acumen that one could not help but wonder what a splash he would have made if he had found the determination to make his mark in the business world. The other mercenary characters were also colourfully potrayed, though sometimes their identities became mixed.<br />Another aspect well-written was Shannon's inner self who found himself always fighting a war whose ultimate beneficiaries were the people he despised bitterly.  An entertaining moment was found in Manson's daughter, beautiful model well-versed in the ways of the world, a barracuda to break men of wealth, becoming almost innocent and childlike when confronted with Shannon's world.<br />Unfortunately, unlike the promise of the book's introduction at the backcover, the Russians never did was played to their full potential.<br />This book offered an alternative perspective to the 60s &amp; 70s, contrasting the concerns and motivations of Europe then to the really dark times in Africa.  Certainly an interesting book, enough to occupy for a long journey, best read uninterrupted if one does not want to lose track of the details.	2001-04-20

Salvatore that is based on his previously created characters in Forgotten Realms.  His previous works in the realms, apart from the Cleric Quintet, focused too much on Drizzt Do'Urden.  Even Spine of the World, considered a radical departure by fans, dealt with Wulfgar, a character which many readers are already familiar.<br />In comparison, Servant of the Shard continued where Silent Blade left off, and finally, two very interesting but under-developed characters, human assassin Enteris Artemis and drow mercenary company Bregan D'aerthe' enigmatic yet brilliant and astute leader Jarlaxle, took the centre stage.<br />Readers would already be familiar some of Enteri's philosophy through earlier novels, but that had at most been a sideshow and a less significant contemplation to act as a comparison to Drizzt's own private reflections.  In this book, Salvatore presented a new yet old Enteri - a man who walks carrying his past, his past life, his old motivations and thoughts, along with new ones which came from his experiences in Menzoberanzan and from finally surviving his duel-to-death against Drizzt.  The fact that Enteri had been forced to work for the Bregan D'aerthe in the latter's foray into the surface world served as a catalyst to Enteri decide what kind of an existence he really would want.<br />Readers did not really get to see the inside of Jarlaxle because he was clearly, though not definitively, influenced by the Crystal Shard.  As the Shard urged to expand its influence, the inevitable conflict leads to more-than-cursory role-playing of secondary characters who were often under-utilised in other novels.  Jarlaxle's top lieutenants from the Underdark, along with Enteri's subordinates running the guild which Enteri took over in Silent Blade, had their work cut out for them.  It is refreshing to see such supporting cast do more than come, go, obey, betray, kill and die, these characters actuallyaffected the development of the events.<br />The plot of the book is a little of a typical gangland turf-war, with more devious plottings and intricate intrigue rather than outright brute force (compared to less flattering depiction of sterotype gangsters in most novels), motivated by the possession of an ultimate weapon (isn't it nice that such a weapon is used in turf wars instead of the run-of-the-mill take over the world, it is so less damaging).<br />Jarlaxle, having completed his goal of establishing indirect but definite influence and network on the surface, brought danger to his mercenary group when goaded by the Shard, sought to expand that dominance aggressively, threatening to expose the drows' presence on the surface.  His lieutenants, justifiably worried, and none-too-kind on Enteri, had to decide the steps to take to protect themselves.<br />Thus set the background stage for one of the best books on underworld intrigues in a fantasy setting where in the foreground really was the internal conflict within Enteri as he fought to keep alive.<br />This is one book where any loopholes are not really discernable nor distracting, worth keeping if you have the money.  The actions are fast and furious, but not too detailed with swashbuckling details as Salvatore's previous books. Salvatore finally came up with something fresh, thankfully.

US	52449229	R9AAIENGNPR92	0425157547	346539551	Drink with the Devil	Books	2	8	11	N	N	Major plot holes mar thriller	Introduction : in 1985, Ulster Loyalist Ryan successfully robbed 50 million pounds of gold, only to lose it in transit when the Irish Rose, a vessel carrying the truck which carried the gold, sank somewhere off the coast of Ireland after sailing off from England.<br />Ten years later, a New York mafia don discovered Ryan and his connection to the lost gold.  He arranged for Ryan to escape and forced Ryan's niece along to salvage the gold, working together with Jack Barry, retired IRA chief.  It appeared that Ryan's gang of robbers had included an IRA mole, whose identity is easily guessed by readers familiar with Higgins' work.<br />Through a stroke of luck, the British authorities learned of the planned salvage and Group 4, aka PM's private army, was put to work to prevent the refunding of either militant factions in Northern Ireland.  The rule, as usual, is &quot;no publicity&quot;, which is somehow important amidst the US-mediated Irish peace process. Higgins' work, as usual, is action packed.  There are less twists and turns, with the prologue taking almost half the book.  His heroes, and heroines, seemed incredibly lucky and outskilled the opponents all the time, and trip only the sheerest bad luck.  As usual, they know exactly where to inquire for their quarry, rendering zilch the laborious detective work.<br />This book would have served well enough if not for some incredible plot holes.<br />First, it was in the papers that the gold was on the Irish Rose which sank between England and Ireland.  Though the British may find it hard to locate the wreck, the IRA had strong clues to narrow the location, and 50 million pounds of gold would have been worth the effort, regardless of whether one is driven by  idealism or greed.<br />Second, Ryan could have retrieved his gold without too much difficulty, but instead he took chances to rob a bank in American and landed in jail.  Why he did nothing, even after finding himself in prison, is a major plot hole.  He could even have contacted his comrades to work something out instead of growing old in prison.	2001-04-09

Day of the Jackal is a ground breaker that has since been copied countless times.<br />The book is about an assassin hired by the OAS (nowadays, they would be called French terrorists, patriots, far-right extremists etc) to kill Charles DeGaulle, president of France. The OAS was composed of French war veterans who felt betrayed by the country they had served with enormous sacrifice to their lives. When Charles DG gave up Algeria, he became the symbol OAS decided had to be struck down. Events turn out such that a foreign professional assassin had to be hired to do the job, and of course, to ensure the balance, the French police had to be tipped off.  Thus the game of cat and mouse began. As the author detailed the workings of both sides, readers are captivated and would actually root for both sides, nevermind the author did explicitly state CDG survived.<br />Of course, critical readers may find certain about of suspension of belief required. First, it was the repeated failed attempts of the OAS members to do the killing themselves that cost OAS its support. The cause of the failure was supposed to be sheer bad luck and silly oversight of the OAS, who were supposed to be experienced soldiers. They may not know much about politics, but to fail in such operations seem rather unforgivable.<br />Second, the serendipidity of the authorities getting on the right track to hunt the Jackal was also incredible.  Whereas the Jackal, codename for the assassin had relied on careful planning and relied not on luck, luck was the only thing the authorities had. The message might be that detective work is long labourious and luck only favours the prepared.<br />Third, I guess there is no way the author can short change the Jackal's effort except to make the assassination attempt fail by the sheerest bad luck.<br />Nonetheless, the structures introduced by the author to the assassination and manhunt was wonderfully captivating. This novel definitely makes true the saying the goal is the journey, not the destination.sination and manhunt was wonderfully captivating.

They kidnapped her to force the President to launch surgical nuclear strikes against Israel's primary adversaries in the Middle-East.<br />Then, the plot just went on a completely wrong angle.  They kidnapped Sean Dillon to act as their messenger to the President. Though what happened later were not bad for an action thriller, I keep wondering why did they want to get a man like Sean Dillon, and more importantly, Charles Ferguson, involved. They could have convinced the President they got the girl and they mean business without involving people who eventually caused their downfall.	2001-03-30
US	52449229	R3FEXFJOSUD60J	0553283936	475102812	The Negotiator	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A great novel, fresh and full of twists	The thickness of the book is worthwhile the effort going through it.  In the Negotiator, Quinn is tasked with negotiating with kidnappers of the son of the US President.  But behind the kidnap is a diabolical plot to destabilise the President who is keen on de-armaments, much to the dismay of some of his own countrymen.<br />Fast and furious through much of the story, the author knew how to slow things down to reflect the tension mounting while waiting for the kidnappers to call, and waiting for them to call again. The novel is not a handbook on handling a kidnap crisis but it does highlight certain issues worth bearing in mind, mainly, survival of the victim should be the most important.  The author added twists in unexpected places, unlike many writers nowadays who made everything so plain with clear subtexts.<br />Quinn as a character, was driven first to secure the safety of the kidnap victim, and later find himself tracking down the kidnappers, his only clue being the flimsiests of flimsiests.<br />What was not satisfying was the parallel plots introduced early in the book on two militant groups, one Russian, one American, to launch take-over in oil-producing countries of the Middle East to secure the fuel supply for the colossal demand of their respective countries. As the novel progresses, one plot became inexplicably dormant, while the other produced a subplot which was also left hanging in the air.  Both plots were too casually concluded at the end of the novel.<br />Also unlike other thrillers, readers are not told that the villains are all-so-powerful that penetrated the highest government and have spies everywhere; it just makes them boring.<br />The novel did provide a few good portrayals of the characters, not too shallow, but enough to make it interesting to watch them act according to their motivations. The author showed that villains did not do bad things because they were evil, they were evil because they did things following their own motivationswhich had unhealthy impact on others, except for psychopaths, of course. In such light, even characters who are traditionally the villains can be put in a good light, something which the author has accomplished.<br />This book gives pure pleasure while reading because readers would not be able to know the ending, just that it would be ... unexpected.	2001-03-15

Why is the sense of déjavu so strong in this one, especially following right after Thunderpoint??!!!<br />I give the books 3 stars because it is fast moving action-packed with a simple plot peppered with some witty dialogues, enjoyable especially for those who had not read Higgins' previous works.<br />Character-wise, is it my imagination or is the old BG Ferguson, veteran of Korean War, getting more and more into the action, seeing him accompanied by different aides (the female in this one is so similar to the one in Eye of the Storm, but of course *SPOILER* Higgins can't use her 'cos she had a thing against Dillon).<br />The introduction of physical/mental therapy for Dillon through Chinese arts was refreshing, but frankly, the short duration it took stretches the credibility.<br />Our heroes seem to make the same mistake again as in Thunderpoint, namely, going after vital objectives while being clearly outgunned when they could have been more careful. And of course, there is slight rehash of Luciano's Luck later in the book.<br />The interesting character was Asta, an enigmatic woman who had no problem shooting to kill but couldn't take care of a drunken lout, namely, one Fergus Munro. Those familiar with Higgins novels would immediately notice this character has the worst of two of Higgins' famous creations : Dougal Munro and Dougal Munro 2nd generation Ferguson, without any of their redeeming qualities.<br />Another bright spot of this book though, is that the villains (Mafia) got news of the Chunking Covenant before a mole leaked out the information to the establishment (heroes). Usually in Higgins story, it is the other way around.	2001-03-14

Readers of Higgins' previous works would have been introduced to Sean Dillon, ex-IRA turned mercenary, a man who had his own codes regarding keeping of one's word but kills ruthlessly.<br />The background to the plot is this : a long lost sunked German U-boat from WW2 was found, and somewhere inside is a briefcase containing a list of secret bank account numbers to fund Nazism after the war, and a list of British secretly supportive of Nazi Germany, including the abdicated former monarch Duke of Windsor. The potential embarassment and backlash led the British PM to give the job for Group Four under BG Ferguson, who in turn sought the assistance of Sean Dillon, given the delicate nature of the job, the sub being in Virgin Islands, US territory and all. However, the operation is not as secret as it should be, for already, descendants of people named in the list were urgently seeking to get the briefcase first.<br />Higgins' flair in his work lies in keeping his story short, quick-moving with not too complicated characters who are just about credible.<br />Unfortunately, there were some loopholes in this one. First of all, the capture of Sean Dillon was rather hard to believe given the past records about him. If he was a chameleon who travels constantly under various guises, it would have been rather hard to believe that Ferguson could have known to bait him in Vienna.<br />Second, how the actual site of the wreck was discovered was rather incredible, given how no one thought of it earlier. Most divers would have come to it sooner.<br />Third, given the resources available to G4, and the critical nature of the job, it seems hard to believe that such a small force was despatched and they kept being tangled by simple hoodlums. People of experiences like Ferguson and Dillon should have been able to prevent most of their mishaps through simple but effective precautions.<br />What is satisfying though was how the villains were terminated.<br />What I could not forget though, was the promise of Martin Brosnan in a previous book, Eye of the Storm, who intended to hound Dillon down. Of course, it was not widely known where Dillon was, but if Dillon was going to come out in the open after completing his job, Brosnan would find him sooner or later to settle the debt. Can't wait for that to happen, hope it does, in a later book.	2001-03-12

Archeological background that dated to the days of King Solomon. 2. Nazi plot to assault the Suez Canal to show Britain her determination after taking Poland 3. Beautiful woman in search of her missing British archaelogist who had earlier went off in search for the legendary Temple of Sheba 4. An archaeologist-mercenary-smuggler Yank who is like Indiana Jones gone native 5. A beautiful smart mixed-blooded businesswoman who liked nothing better but meddle in affairs of other people, always accompanied by a hulk of an escaped slave with a life-debt (think Chewbacca) 6. A host of desertmen, Arabs, throw in even a German professor and Greek moneyman<br />Then it all started to go wrong. Using the title &quot;Sheba&quot;, what could have been a pulp 30s adventure in the mysterious Orient just didn't turn out. Higgins had the ingredients but just didn't know how to produce the right product. Such a mystical name, Sheba, didn't deserve the ignominious treatment Higgins dished out.<br />It's acceptable that the characters didn't have the same depth and complexity as Macbeth by Shakespeare. It's pulp fiction. It's fine that the Nazi plot failed, we know anyway that the Suez wasn't destroyed in WW2. But we also know the Germany didn't win and Churchchill wasn't kidnapped (or was he?) and these didn't detract from his other works, including the famed &quot;The Eagle has landed&quot;.<br />It would have been better if Higgins had collaborated with another writer who knows how to use the ingredients better.	2001-03-07

Brit Intel agents 2. Master-criminal/spy 3. Ambitious larger than life targets - as usual, the British PM 4. Small-time crooks who became untied loose ends that eventually tripped the villain 5. Traitor within the British establishment<br />There is now of course the introduction of the veteran Liam Devlin, the man who never grew old and moved as he did during the Gulf War as he did during the WW2. His successor is Martin Brosnan, with the same self-effacing humour, a former IRA who through strange circumstances found himself working for British interests.<br />Sean Dillon though, was unforgivably stupid to have made the errors that eventually led to his failure.<br />The final question is, is there a criminal in Higgins' novel who is not virtually invincible?<br />This book is worth the reading, for a quick theory/speculation of how the British War Cabinet survived an almost random assault - the kind which would never have been detected if not for stupid mistakes on the perpetrators.<br />While the characters echoed those from earlier novels, there is enough variation in the plot to make it interesting.	2001-03-05

Tension, fast moving plot, sometimes excruciating while the author takes the reader slowly through the thoroughness of the details, leaving the readers in suspense of the outcome.<br />Like many masterpieces, villains and heroes are not always so well defined. British MI5 agent John Preston has the serendipidity to be at the right place at the right time despite his superior's best efforts to the otherwise. Uncovering the scent of a case after case, his doggedness enabled him to penetrate layers of deceit and patience rewarded by necessary breaks.<br />The Russians were no less masters of the game, and in fact, better and it was through sheer bad luck that they were discovered.<br />Despite the lengthy introduction of characters though, readers could not really feel for the cast, except for perhaps John Preston who was separated from his wife and looks forward only to spending time with his son.<br />Nonetheless, the lack of characterisation was more than made up by brilliant twists and turns that would keep a reader continuing through anything.	2001-02-28

Nonetheless, the fate of the world depended on such for defence against a despotic ruler aided by mysterious knights.<br />Unlike other fantasy settings, there is never a grand stage which detailed the lands and the people - the author gave little information about the world. Nonetheless, the official persecution of the group of people in the book known as the Nomads hardly require any elaboration as it is a throwback to the anti-semitic practices in history.<br />It is a refreshing to see the heroes are practically outclassed in terms of magical and physical prowess, with barely an edge on moral grounds. Heroes can die and did die and the ending is not predictable.<br />What is unsatisfactory is that the epilogue ended a tale which have not ended.	2001-02-23

In the fourth book chronicling the adventures of Sir Pirvan, a Solamnic knight who started out as a thief, there are two threads of development in the tale.<br />One is of Sir Pirvan's adventure to discover and eliminate the threat on Suivinari island which menaced human and minotaur sailors who had a rare, mutual, if unspoken, agreement, to share the island as a replenishing station for their ships.<br />The other thread involves Gerik, son of Pirvan, who had to defend their home, Tirabot Manor, against minions of the kingpriest who would like to eliminate those who practiced true virtues instead of paying lip service.<br />The book went through many events without giving a proper account of events and background.  Instead, the narration is given through eyewitness accounts of the characters but very little explanation of what the character thinks and knows and thereby how they came to the conclusions they made.  This is a maddening pattern.  People unfamiliar with the world of Krynn would be unable to follow the book at all.  This applies to all four books.<br />The reason why I described the titles of the series as misnamed is because little so far had been given to provide insight to the workings of the Knights.  Instead, each adventure becomes like a process in gaining experience points to promote the lead character up the ranks of the Knight, without giving a proper account of the Order, the Measure and the Oath.  The writer's way of addressing the Measure and the Oath, the central tenet of the knighthood, became merely a conceptualisation of the experiences of Sir Pirvan.  What is wrong with this is it cheated the readers from actually learning about the Order itself, which is what should be expected, given the titles of the book.<br />Even the last title, the Wayward Knights, was not truly reflected by the story contained; there is little sense that the knights mentioned had really been wayward.<br />There is actually little wrong with the story as a fantasy tale, but when a series of book had the Knights of the Crown, Knights of the Sword, Knight of the Rose and the Wayward Knights as their title, I expect to be shown more about a knight making his way through the Order, dealing with more people within the Order, rather than merely setting off on quests.  The series reflected little of learning of loyalty associated with Knights of the Crown, little of how valour is associated with Knights of the Sword, little of how justice and wisdom is associated with Knights of the Rose, and how Habbakkuk, Kiri-Jolith and Paladine are honoured and modeled after.<br />Furthermore, higher level ranking Knights of the Sword and Rose have at their disposal certain spells which they should have been utilising.  After all, this is pre-Cataclysmic Krynn.	2001-02-09

The premise is that the Istarian expansionist ambitions led it once again to send an army to assert its authority and influence in foreign legions, this time, towards the elves of Silvanesti.  Anxious to prevent a military endeavour that would probably cause Istar (further) shame and drag the Knights to a dishonourable campaign, Sir Marod despatch Sir Pirvan &amp; Company (this time, accompanied not just by his wife Haimya, but also his son &amp; daughter as well as proteg&eacute; Darin).  Along the way, he won the confidence of the Plainsmen, known as the Free Riders.  Finally, Pirvan reached Belthukas, a sanctuary for all races, led by a couple of half-elven rangers and their daughter Ryth.  Belthukas was to be THE meeting point of all forces as the Silvanesti elves send a delegation there to parley with the tax-collectors from Istar (in the form of mercenary companies and Istarian regulars and another delegation of Knights led by Sir Lewin, another disciple of Sir Marod).<br />Like Knights of the Sword, it becomes a tightrope situation for Pirvan who had to steer the situation from escalating into a full-blown all-out war.  Greedy and ambitious mercenaries, anxious to make a name for themselves and win credit for Istar preferred to force conflicts against outnumbered entrenched local defenders.  Pirvan had to defend Belkuthas as best as he can, keep them surviving until cooler heads can prevail.<br />Noteworthy of the author is that the detailing of the journey which added interest in the earlier books were skipped over, avoiding the tedium it would become had it been included in this book.  More attention also given to new supporting characters and the stage is set in a totally different location - no eventful maritime voyages!<br />What went wrong with this book is that the author opened up a lot of possibilities: romances among the youngsters, titanic battle of the arcane arts between wizards, elven racial prejudices and political intrigues back in Istar (or civilisation).  Also, nothing was mentioned with regards to Sirbones being more than familiar to Darin and Pirvan &amp; Co from the previous book.<br />Sir Marod and Sir Lewin who played important (but short) roles were not properly fleshed out.  The enigmatic behaviours of the lord of Belkuthas, Krythis and the elven ranger Tharash were not explained at all, leaving a strong sense of dissatisfaction.<br />Last but not least, the slightest detail regarding the political resolution at Istar which culminated with the resignation of the Istarian commander and elevation of Sir Pirvan to Knight of the Rose is completely left out (given the title of the book, it should be no spoiler) - the same brickbat for Knights of the Sword.<br />Roland Green had simply left too many things in between unaccounted for.nic battle of the arcane arts between wizards, elven racial prejudices and political intrigues back in Istar (or civilisation).

Throughout the entire tale, there is nothing to explain why the book is titled &quot;Redemption of Althalus&quot;?  Althalus is supposed to be the main character of the book.  Unlike Eddings' other books where the tale is told through the perspectives of more than one person, every scene uses Althalus eyes and ears.<br />Readers are introduced to Althalus at the beginning of the novel as a burglar, thief, sometimes robber and occassional murderer.  He gambles, drinks and womanises, but is also a great story-teller and comedian.  Even though he was meant to be a reformed hero of the tale, the authors failed to villify him enough in character and deed to make the readers feel for any significant reformation necessary.<br />Eddings did make Althalus different enough from the rogue characters in the previous novels - Silk (aka Prince Kheldar) and Stragen.  Althalus was truly poor, and hail from rural regions rather than urban environments.  In the beginning of the story, readers saw how Althalus found himself out of his depths when he tried to ply his trade in civilisations.  It does raise the question however, how slick a thief can he be without ever operating in larger communities?  Thiefs find it hard to stay long enough in small communities to become experts - a practicing thief in a small village will soon be discovered, if not caught, and small communities are usually wary of strangers.<br />After being commissioned to steal a Book from the House at the End of the World, Althalus found himself shanghai-ed by the House's occupant, a talking cat who was later named Emerald.  Emerald took many centuries teaching Althalus to read, and to use special Words to effect magic.  Then she took him out back to the world to gather a group of special people destined to counter Daeva's (the ArchNemesis) plans to re-define Creation. After the gathering, Althalus' group began to counter the moves made by Ghend's group.  Along the way, there young people falling in love, clans of highland mercenaries fighting to defend civilisations, as well as peasant insurrection.<br />The good points about this book is the sardonic humour found in the beginning before Althalus gathered his little group.  Eddings could bring in good humour in self-conversation and other secondary characters etc.  However, the humour immediately dried up when Althalus began recruiting other characters.  The story became plain narration of events without giving depths of the important characters.<br />It became rather boring once Althalus acquire the Knife because there is no real sense of threat or quest.  Whether it was recruiting group members or countering enemy threat, everything was plain sailing for Emerald and Althalus.  They were simply too powerful with the means to do anything, everything, anytime and anywhere.  Their opponents were supposed to have the same powers as them but just did not use them properly; the exception, a saving grace, was an unexpected move which cause serious injury to a member in Althalus' party, and even then, it was resolved without significant turns in the plot.<br />There were a few half-hearted attempts with respect to introducing the theological paradigms but it fizzled because it had little relevance to the tale.  Bheid, the priestly member of Althalus group, talked like a half brain-washed drone rather than someone who had human intelligence.  Religious people aren't brainless, they see things (very) differently and are differently motivated. Their talking may sound nonsensical to others but not themselves.  Even when they encounter doctrines or events they are uncomfortable with, they don't immediately fall apart speechless.<br />Althalus' countering of Ghend's moves in three different areas - a pasture land region, cities and peasant insurrection, were okay - a bit boring 'cos he's got just the right troops for everything, but the story went wild with the introduction of time-travel.  In changing the past, Eddings seemed to forget that they would change the things to come, even though it was supposed to be minor changes.  SPOILER ALERT - if Althalus was not known as the thief who robbed Gosti, his name (and infamy) would not have been passed down the generations, something which he had used extensively in the story.<br />The introduction of Gher as someone who offers unusual perspective is brilliant - Gher seems to offer a voice for the readers to the possibilities available to people with amazing powers.  Unfortunately, it all fell apart with changing the past.<br />The enemies are never fleshed out, a weakness of Eddings taken to the extreme in this story.<br />Annoying as Eddings' male-female conversation can be sometimes ('cos they are mainly rehash of previous works), those aren't the novel's real weakness.<br />The real weakness of the novel is the failure to convey an epic sense of adventure, danger, threat, thrill, grandeur, sacrifice, and ultimate victory.	2001-01-16

In this book, the reader is introduced to an adventure set in the pre-Cataclysm Ansalon.  There is the growing complacency among the humans, especially in the court of the PriestKing of Istar. There are the White, Red and Black Robes and the Towers of the wizards. Last but not least, there are the not-so-stuffy Knights who embarked on a mission to evacuate a too-successful band of bandits to prevent a potential war in Karthay.<br />Waydol, an exiled minotaur, went among the humans to learn of their strengths and weaknesses. In the course of his mission, he created a highly organised group of bandits that roamed the countryside of Karthay. Ever alert to the potential of expanding its power, the Istarian court despatched an army to Karthay to eradicate the bandits, threatening to take direct control of the distant region. Anxious to prevent a war between the Istarians and the Karthayians, Sir Pirvan the Wayward, along with his wife and old friends, embarked on a race against time to evacuate the bandits if the outlaws are willing, or to eliminate them before the Istarian army entrenches itself in Karthay. To meet Waydol, Pirvan had to travel over hostile countryside riddled with various outlaws, some in tacit support of Waydol, others finding the bounty on the minotaur too tempting. Meanwhile, his friend Jemar the Fair led a convoy of ships, braving the rough seas and stormy weather and above all, his pregnant wife who insisted on tagging along.<br />Against them, besides the outlaws, is the highly disciplined Istarian army, locally raised militias of Karthayians anxious not to give Istar any excuse against Karthay, and the Istarian fleet complemented with the mysterious priests of Zeboim who were acting under orders from the PriestKing, or was it really Zeboim?<br />Pirvan was counting on the help from his wife Haimya, Jemar the Fair, his old friend the mage Tarothin, the mage's love interest the Black-Robed Rubina and Epron the mercenary captain.<br />Roland Green did a good job in fleshing out little know aspects of the Dragonlance world. His characters are interesting in their virtues, weaknesses and motivations.<br />Unfortunately, he left out parts which could have been interesting undeveloped - the schemes of the priestking, his silent servants etc.	2000-11-30

Would they share the same ideals beneath the contrasting exterior ?  Or would they turn into mortal enemies, each a product of his own background ?  But instead, all I got was two people going through virtually identical processes, becoming flying aces and shooting down bandits like duck hunting season.  Identical promotions every step of the way.  They could have interchange their identities at any point as many times as they'd wish without making any difference to the tale.  They fly because that's all they want to do, with scant regard for the cause they fought for. At least the Baroness, though not necessarily a very likable woman, knew what she stood for.<br />Speaking of promotions, in no other book have I seen officers like Munro and Carter being promoted every few chapters/pages. This just stretches the credibility of the book.<br />As usual, Himmler was up to his old tricks, manipulating everyone and using the same old tricks.  Even the officers he entrusted the missions to appear to have the same old struggle between doing a job as a professional and becoming a mere lackey.  Somehow, the Third Reich never seems to be short of undercover agents in London ready to work for them.<br />Higgins would do well to seek better reviews and revisions before getting his book published in the future.	2000-11-13

Nearly two years later, a hostage rescue mission in the Middle East conducted by the Royal Marines in conjunction with warplanes from the HMS Eagle resulted in the death of the hostage and all the would-be rescuers except for the commander, Captain Peter.  All the botched operation achieved besides the destruction of the organisation of the kidnappers was to leave their leader Abdul Habib alive with a burning hunger for revenge, and the enough money to achieve it. Two events : a prominent Turkish political commentator died attempting to warn the President of the United States of an impending nuclear outbreak in the Middle, and a known associate of the Habib was spotted smuggling into Spain, convinces Peter that the two events are linked. With little information and links to follow, stopping them would be difficult.  But more difficult for Peter would be to convince his bosses who were convinced that Peter was still suffering from the trauma of the botched rescue.<br />Unfortunately, the author failed to develop several promising areas which could have make the book more gripping.  Instead, the focus was on Peter as he stumbles through the bureaucrats and his own self-confidence. Abdul Habib could have been a very interesting villain who was confined to displaying his desire for revenge and seems to possess a clairvoyance to evade his pursuers without any problems.  A sideplay of &quot;naughty naughty&quot; in the Whitehall failed to make itself relevant but became just a related premise.  More interesting was the play of rivalry between the forces of the UK, US and the Russians who had to cooperate together but with very different agendas.<br />If Tom Clancy had written this book, it would have been four times as long with only twice the content. Geoffrey Archer though, gave too little to flesh out the characters.	2000-11-10

They range from murder to abandonment, to fraud, everyone wants a piece of Patrick Lanigan and it seems that there's not enough of him to satisfy all.<br />But Patrick had yet to play all his cards.  He has a beautiful and smart partner out there coordinating with him, using the US$90M as a powerful tool.  Despite his infamy, he still has friends in the legal circles, sympathetic and willing to help.  However, his most powerful weapon it seems is the truth itself, which he deployed to unravel everything that stood against him.<br />It was interesting how much court room scene actually turned out in the face of all the legal actions flying around.  Despite the atrocities charged to Patrick, the author made it clear that he is a figure to root for, hence readers could expect from the beginning that Patrick was not a monster.  Thus it was not surprise that revelations and twists came to save him, only the nature of those twists.<br />Despite the seemingly brilliant plan Patrick had to save himself, thoughtful readers would notice several large holes in Patrick's plan - namely, the one thing he had failed to plan for in the event of his capture turned out to be one of his most important salvation.	2000-10-24

To those who are familiar with Dragonlance, or indeed AD&amp;D, this book breached a number of &quot;traditions&quot; -<br />1. Pirvan the Spell Thief - cast without memorising from notes, fights better than the average fighters, has a highly developed sense of honour etc.  Many thieving characters do have honour, but hardly as finely developed for one who is supposed to be so young.<br />2. A thieves' guild asking a thief to return the loot which had been acquired &quot;fair and square&quot; ???<br />3. What is actual strength level of the Golden Cup ?  At times it seems to be weak, especially in Karthay, but they can kick minotaurs' butts!<br />4. How difficult is the voyage supposed to be from Istar to Karthay to Craters' Gulf?  Or is the Golden Cup just plainly unlucky?<br />5. How is it that Pirvan can become so well known and endangered upon his return?  Unless the comrades he went through the voyage are big mouth louts who are reckless of his safety.<br />6. How powerful the House of Encuintras really is ?  They can't keep a thief out of the room of the daughter of the House, they can deter people from crossing them openly, they can't get Gerik released for a long time, they can send an expedition to ransom him with enough force to fight minotaurs, they quibble over the ransom sum so much that Eskaias has to add her own dowry to it, a lot of things are just internally inconsistent.<br />7. Fustiar's and the black dragon completely lacked any personality and motivation, more info on them would have improved the book.<br />8. Now we learn that the Solamnic Knights are so stiff-necked holier-than-thou after all, they actually run a CIA-type of agency doing some dirty work which normal honourable knights wouldn't dream of.<br />The title of the book is completely misleading - at least in Luck of the Weasel and Galen Beknighted, we have a more realistic expectation of thebook.<br />BTW, where in the story did that red dragon and plate-armoured knight wielding the long weapon feature in the story ?	2000-10-19

Two of the more interesting characters, Morgalla and Vartain, introduces a study of contrast in characters - one is not generally regarded as capable but has a strong sense of empathy, the other can be a teacher of Sherlock Holmes but lacks even a sense of humour - between these two, clearly, we may admire or respect the latter more for his capability, but only associate with him to bask in the reflected glory or only to utilise his skills, never as a friend which is what we would like the former to be.<br />The pitting of the Lords of Waterdeep against the Knights of the Shield would have been more interesting if the author had given readers more insight into the two organisations.<br />Even towards the end of the book, new revelations keep appearing, making this one of the most interesting book to read.  Unlike a hack and slash story, the key to this one is that of wits and relying on one's soul.	2000-10-11

Clancy's books I liked : Patriot Games, Hunt for the Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, Clear and Present Danger, Sum of All Fears, Without Remorse, and to some extent, Debt of Honour and Executive Orders.  Had not the chance to read Red Storm Rising, yet.<br />What I liked about his stories : 1. Originality 2. Realistic characters, with strengths and vulnerabilities and faults. 3. Very diverse lines to development until brought together neatly. 4. More-or-less accurate information technology<br />What is lacking in The Bear and the Dragon ? All of the above. Plus spelling errors and errors in grammar. 1. Originality - a kind way to put it is the premise has been done with Red Storm Rising - big country, big army, desperate for oil and resources. 2. Realistic characters - the only realistic guy is the undersecretary of state, the treacherous amoral twerp, others carry haloes around their heads or pitchforks with tails. 3. Diverse plots - the only bit of mystery of the assassination attempt, and even then, it was weak.  Without giving away the story, my guess is that most people can guess the development and the ending even before they are halfway through the book. 4. Information Technology - how easily can the computer of a PA to a minister be tapped.  Clancy was mixing 70s technology with the 90s (not 2000s) hardware.  Good grief.  That is about the most clumsy way to plant a bug and it succeeded.<br />Clancy portraits the Chinese the way they were in the 70s - 80s, technologically and culturally.  Wake up, their governments' IT hardware may not be up to par with Europe's or America's but they are certainly not in the stone-age.<br />Another thing is the rest of the world would not idly stand by when China invades Russia.  China has a lot of close links with the governments and economies of Europe and South East Asia and North Asia.  Did they simply disappear ?<br />Credibility aside,Clancy seems to be preaching Americanism. Good luck with the next book, now that the last superpower crumbles under the American might, Ryan would be preaching Americanism to the Klingons next.	2000-10-10

There are parallels between most of the characters - the pilot, the blackmarketeering gangsters, the Nazi spies etc.  The British were not as serendipitious in this case as before, though Ludlum did lead readers to think they might be.  Devlin should have learnt not to leave live enemies behind, esp blackmarketeers. The ending though, was rather abrupt.  Readers could have guessed that Himmler had something up his sleeve but I was disappointed when his real intent for the rescue of Steiner was not more sinister.  OTOH, how his plots were discovered were just to ridiculous.	2000-09-29

The characters were done well, the good guys ain't so good and the bad guys aint' so bad - Elaine did a good job introducing their background and why they are like that. The treatment of the paladins sucks, they were like, cardboards. And a high ranking official among the paladins who can masquarade without being detected, unbelievable. Worse was the reasoning why Khelben fell out with the other & quot;good & quot; forces, and why the Harpers would be under suspicion.  The tale just doesn't warrant that kind of split.	2000-09-28

This was before the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis occurred, though the threat of Communism was looming.  Finally, the conspirators all (but one) backed off because of threat to their financial ruin, their most closely guarded secret achilles' heels - all discovered by a dame within less than four weeks.<br />What would have made the book great was 1.  How the conspirators came together, their motives, etc. 2.  What the conspirators really hoped to achieve to their gain. 3.  How dame Scarlet discovered their vulnerabilities. 4.  How she knew the potential horror of their project.<br />From the beginning of the book, readers are already told that Ulster lived, and that there were records in the government archives.  From what happened in Zurich, how much would have been revealed to the government anyway ? The ending of the story was, totally boooorrrrrrriiiiinnnnggg.<br />The whole creation of the book seem to be like the author had an idea of a conspiracy, wove the peripheral details around it in an excellent manner (give him the credit here), lost his Muse and couldn't provide the real meat for the dish.  For all its excellent starters and garnishing, the main course proved hollow and there was no desert to attempt a decent exit.<br />*sigh*	2000-09-25

However, the  motive supplied for the Hagannah's violent intervention was unjustified,  potential of failure high with great risks of exposure.  Secrecy was the  key to the success of the Tortugas players (ie, to get what they wanted and  avoid being exposed for dealing with the enemy).  All the Haganah needed to  have done was make some public exposure, or even give just a hint to make  things hot for the players and all Tortugas players would be stopped cold.   The rest of the book was okay, fast moving and the action sequences rather  lame. That David Spaulding led such a charmed life that his life was  continually spared while Ed Pace was snuffed out was rather hard to  swallow.  Furthermore, no explanation was given about Leslie's mention of  Bonner.	2000-09-07

Also, the power of the Black Warlock was stretched beyond  &quot;realism&quot;.  Come on, taking on the Emerald Witch AND the White  Mage, IN their own DOMAINS.  And how was he able to imbue his dead general  and the artefact with so much power, not unless he clone his power.  But if  it were that easy, the others could have done so too, not in the same  &quot;evil&quot; way but in a &quot;good&quot; way.  Militarily, rushing  mass numbers against fortified bridges is pure suicide.  Maybe the Calvans  etc don't have much knowledge of military tactics but common sense + Billy  Shanks should provide some clue there.  Besides, why didn't the Calvans use  incendiaries and other heavy stuff like catapults (they had the  Firethrowers).<br />Where it lacked emotional appeal; death of Andovar +  rescue of Belexus = senseless.

There are plenty of Antediluvian &quot;resources&quot; available that could have been taken made use of to  flesh out more life into the book.  The plot is so darn straight forward  that nothing surprises the reader anymore. Cussler's world has so many  secret organisations that are so high-powered super-financed with links to  every government that they cannot be prosecuted (add the baddies from all  his earlier novels) that it is a great wonder that they don't run into each  other or conflict each other's interests.  It seems that only the  mainstream government is completely infiltrated. What is so terrible about  the Fourth Empire (so unimaginative) is that they are supposed to comprise  of so many people (hundreds of thousands) and yet remain undetected even  though they have hit teams everywhere in the world. That the Wolf sisters  were genetically engineered served absolutely no purpose in the story other  than to indicate advances in biotech which the Wolfs couldn't find better  use.  Neither was the nanotech which if they really had it, could be better  used than what they had to achieve their purpose.  It's like having an  aircraft carrier to fight a war and using it only to fire grapeshot  cannons. And how many times must Hitler be revived in novels ?  His  inclusion again served no purpose at all other than to irritate readers.	2000-08-23

Even  right to the very end, the possibility that the Germans could have  succeeded in real life was hinted without stretching credibility.<br />The  introduction of characters were done in a very orderly and logical manner,  unlike other books which pop them out of the blues before tying the  characters into the plot together.<br />What is more remarkable is the  recognition that regardless of nationalities, everyone is human (except for  Steiner who's almost perfect).  Not everyone from the Allies is good, nor  is every German or Irish bad.	2000-08-22

It may be hard to accept traditional  enemies as being humans and even honourable but that is how life is.<br />As  practically everyone knows that Churchill lived to see the end of the war,  it was not a real issue whether the Germans succeeded but the Higgins wove  the tale in such an absorbing way that the reader actually forgets that and  think it really could have been pulled off.

None of his friends could fathom the demons that haunt him, even if he could speak of them.  Just imagine going through abuse, torture, torment  and death in the most sadistic VC POW camp (or anything else you can think  of) not just once but many times.  At least in the real-world, one only  dies once.<br />Salvatore had made a good attempt to provide readers with a  glimpse of the extent of the torture Wulfgar had suffered without going  into needless details of gore, the robbing of Wulfgar of his humanity, his  loved-ones and his seed. That he could still be rational (at times) after  that is a testimony that his soul is not lost, but terribly wounded.  Those  who call him a whiner, well, unless they have been through his hell and  came out better, what do they know besides making callous insensitive  judgements ?<br />I had been wondering at the end of Silent Blade how  Salvatore was going to bring Wulfgar back to &quot;normality&quot;.  Not by  being protected by his friends Bruenor, Drizzt or Cattie-Brie, that's for  sure.  They, like Duerdemont, wanted Wulfgar to back the way *they*  remembered him, or at least, wanted Wulfgar to *snap out of it* somehow,  but that only made Wulfgar feel isolated from them, the message was they  did not want to accept Wulfgar the way he was.  They can pity him, but they  cannot make Wulfgar believe they understand him, or even accept him because  of the Wulfgar they knew.  Even without them doing much, Wulfgar felt the  pressure and the demand on him to be who he was to them in the past, but he  had not been able to deal with himself in the present, much less come to  terms and get on with life. Wulfgar needed to be away from them.  Morik and  Arumn had not known him before, so in their presence, there was no pressure  of any sort for Wulfgar, no image to live up to.  He took to the bottle to  numb his pain, but at least, he could concentrate of himself rather than  live day to day without the &quot;pressure&quot; to be back to his former  self. Salvatore tried to show how gradually Wulfgar exorcise part of the  haunting demons, and how gradually he starts to rebuild himself.  It was  important to Wulfgar that he was free to rebuild himself without having to  meet the expectations of other people who had known him in the past. The  ending of his redemption, if the process was indeed over, was a bit fast.   But then again, at the end of Passage to Dawn, when Wulfgar was rescued, he  was acting in much better way and did not exhibit the strain shown in  Silent Blade.  Wulfgar was able to settle the issue of the leadership  wisely with regards to his tribe. That left me wondering whether Salvatore  worsen Wulfgar's condition in Silent Blade or it was usual that a person  suddenly freed from torment could be &quot;normal&quot; for a while before  the strain fully manifest itself. It also took a while before the two half  of the story intertwine.  I don't grudge Salvatore for writing the two  halves the way he did.  It is a fantasy novel, but in that way, it offered  a glimpse of how the &quot;normal&quot; people lived, the  &quot;normal&quot; people who worked the farm to produce the food and  drinks our heroes use in all their adventures.  I don't think it is a  cliche romantic novel half at all.  Ordinary people are important in their  own right, and that is not something that is always properly addressed in  fantasy novels.  They are afterall, the backbone of any milieu. I don't  usually have the patience to go through details of combat, and I am glad  that unlike others, Wulfgar was not portrayed as invincible.  I hope this  does not end when Wulfgar recovered fully. Looking forward to the next  book.	2000-03-29

He went too far, too deep and too preachy in his imagination of how things  were to turn out.  His lengthy preface to Major Barbara may well reflect  sentiments at the turn of the century, but he never looked at the question  &quot;whether he imagined the impoverished becoming like him or him  becoming like the impoverished&quot; when he talked idealistically against  the tyranny of poverty.  He showed no comprehension of basic economics,  social evolution nor human nature.  Had he lived longer, he might have seen  it in the collapse of communism in eastern Europe.  That is not to say Shaw  was espousing communism, and it can be argued that the communism was an  imperfect implementation of a perfect solution.  The same then can be said  of a lot of other things, including Christianity, the Church, the Salvation  Army, nationhood, law enforcement as well as the judiciary.  None set out  to commit the sins they did.  At the end of the day, helping feed a single  individual may cause no more harm than helping no individuals but sitting  down and espousing fine rhetorics and theories and ideals which lead to  establishment of institutions modelled after them which affect thousands  instead.	1998-10-09
