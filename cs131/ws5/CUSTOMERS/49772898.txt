He has no expertise whatsoever in medicine. He has been arrested for [...] in similar scams to this book. Seriously, don't buy it.    His advice, such as it is, boils down to three types:    1) The self evident; he tells you the \\"secret they don't want you to know\\" that excercise is good for you. Gosh, that's sticking it to the Man!  2) The meaninglessly vague/misleading; ie much blather about \\"natural\\" and \\"organic\\", with little actual insertion of meaning into those buzzwords  3) The outright false and dangerous; ie advising you not to wear sunscreen, claiming that it's the sunscreen which will give you skin cancer. (That claim, btw, is totally false!)    Oh, and he frequently tells you very little, often referring you to his website... where you have to pay to get any info (NOW do you believe he's simply a huckster, out to cheat you of your greenbacks?) and if you do fall for it, he just offers more of the three types above.    Don't buy this. The fact that anyone does merely proves some old adages of PT Barnum & HL Mencken.	2005-09-12
US	49772898	R1IUF9NDOAFQCG	0689876475	322710441	Nothing's Sacred	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Back in Black	Like probably everyone who has ever heard of him, I first encountered Lewis Black in his weekly rant on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. And if you don't watch that arch news parody show, bygosh you should. Black is a very component of a very funny show. <br /> <br />His comedy revolves around two main facets. One is his complete outrage at the idiocy of it all. And of course, idiocy is in plentiful supply in the world. He aims his anger at stupidity on all sides of the political aisle. He calls atheists stupid for caring that the words \\"under God\\" are in the pledge of allegiance. He calls the religious right stupid for caring whether gays can get married. He lambasts Bill Clinton for being a moron. Then lambasts George W Bush for being a moron. Idiocy is the great uniter. <br /> <br />His other great strength is his delivery, his raspy voice the shouting embodiment of exasperation. If you are familiar with it, you can picture this book in your head as you read it, spoken in Black's trademark cadence, and it will be a lot better. If you're unfamiliar with him, you might want to subtract a star from this review's rating. <br /> <br />Note that the book is not a collection of his stand up routines or Daily Show rants. [Note, also, for the sensitive: the book is frickin' loaded with profanity.] It's mostly an autobiography, where he talks about his family, his life in college, his failed attempts at theatre, his college life in the radical 60's, even his dog. He frankly discusses his own drug use, fairly admitting his own stupidity on this count, though clearly he has some sentimentality about some of t5he old tripping days. <br /> <br />It turns out that Black is a pretty good storyteller. He has some interesting tales to share, he convincingly defends his anti-stupidity/anti-authority streak, and much of the book is quite funny, occasionally laugh out loud funny. <br /> <br />Worth a read, though as I said, it goes down smoother if you're already a little familiar with his style.	2005-05-26
US	49772898	R37X51KG619MUV	0399149864	919064525	Pattern Recognition	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Gibson Tries the Prsent	William Gibson is well known as the godfather of cyberpunk, imagining techno worlds of the near future. In Pattern Recognition, he takes a different tack: the book is set in the real world in 2002. You can argue how realistic the book is - but nothing about it is so fanciful to qualify as \\"science fiction\\".    The heroine here is Cayce Pollard. Like Laney, the protagonist in 2 previous Gibson novels, she has an intuitive talent for cutting through the BS and seeing what others can't. For Cayce, this means being able to  know at a glance what kind of advertising will be effective. She's sent on a job by a marketing tycoon to locate the unknown creator of some online movie footage that is generating significant underground buzz.    This has nods to some of the author's earlier work (heck, Pollard's name alone echoes Case, the hacker hero of Gibson's breakthrough book, Neuromancer), but the author really being channeled here is John Le Carre. The picture of post cold war intrigue clearly bears the influence of Le Carre's later work, notably Single & Single and The Tailor of Panama.    First, the bad stuff: While the envisioning of a world where it's not government spies in search of intel, but corporations in search of information/ideas is interesting (and a clear bridge to the corp-dominated world of cyberpunk), but seems a little out of whack with the present. Investing in ideas without product? Didn't that burst with the 90's tech bubble? While some of the characters are well developed, others are mere cyphers (including one of the main baddies; he might as well have just named her \\"(...)\\"). The straightforward plot resolves fairly enough... but not to any great revelation. There's no twist, no surprise, no new revelations when all is revealed.     On the good side: Gibson has always been more about creation of a strange new world and strange ideas that might be ingenious visions of the future (or might just be nuts - which is almost as good). He's never been the sci-fi author for whom intricate plotting is his strength (check out Neal Stephenson or Walter Jon Williams if that's more your cup of tea). Even in the real world, his dream-like way of looking at things is fascinating, aided by his formiddable prose skills. Some reviewer once said that Gibson could spend 3 pages describing a wall, and you're left thinking \\"That's an interesting wall!\\" I concur with that assessment. In Pattern Recognition, he applies that almost-real-yet-kind-of-different lens, and we get zealous fangroups that feel like they could indeed happen, marketers who seem mighty extravagant - but maybe not >too< much more than real ones, and computer tech that may or may not be realistic (I've no idea) but definitely >feels< like the present en route to the future.    It's a decent book, but not his best by any means. In fact, it seems like a variation on Gibson's usual fare, and might be more rewarding if you've read some of his earlier work. (Try the short story collection Burning Chrome, and/or the \\"cyberspace\\" trilogy: Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive).	2005-02-26

As one who's been doing it for a little less than a year, I found his book very helpful. <br /> <br />The various chapters cover useful topics, including: how to select your binoculars (and what those numbers on them mean); what to wear - and not to wear - while looking for birds; how to set up a feeder and make your own back yard more attractive to birds; protecting birds from threats ranging from cats to glass; finding a good field guide; organizations and events; the basics of identifying birds; plus some interesting stories from the field, care of Dunne and other experienced bird watchers. There's a lot of helpful information, that will make a nascent birder feel less clueless. <br /> <br />A few things that might have made it better: there's little info on ornithology itself - Dunne frequently mentions various types of birds as examples, but you may have no idea what he's talking about. When discussing the all-important field marks, for example, there are some (black and white) photos, but more of them (and perhaps illustrations) might have made his points more clear. For instance, showing the difference between the different tail shapes would have been useful. Also, while he mentions many species and family, there's not even a basic rundown of the different types of birds - so if you don't know a sparrow from a warbler, some of his text seems meaningless. <br /> <br />Note also that this is not a field guide (nor does it claim to be) so you'll need something else to help you identify the birds you see. <br /> <br />Combined with a couple of other books like a good field guide (the Peterson guides seem to be the gold standard) and a basic text on ornithology (David Sibley's books get high marks from many) and Dunne's book on birding techniques, and you should be ready to go.	2005-02-12

At the bottom of every review on Amazon, it asks \\"Was this review helpful to you?\\" and lets you click on yes or no. Yet perusual of books on any controversial subject - especially politics - leads me to suspect that people often vote yes/no on \\"do I agree with the politics of the reviewer?\\" <br /> <br />I'll try to review GYWO2 in a way that at least will be helpful for anyone, whether you saw \\"Farrenheit 9/11\\" or whether you never trust anyone not on Fox News. <br /> <br />This book collects a comic strip, which is entirely 3-panel strips using clip art. Presumably Rees wanted to do a comic but can't draw. The illustrations all show office workers talking, with a few variations, enough to suggest Rees is trying (and partly succeeding) to use the comics medium fully. It also suggests an \\"everyman perspective\\" for the material. All of the strips are on politics, almost always foreign policy - as the title suggests, the war on terror is the main focus. Here's a typical one-liner from this collection: <br /> <br />\\"Will future historians describe Bush's foreign policy as the Grand Theft Auto school of diplomacy?\\" <br /> <br />If you found that amusing, this looks like the book for you. If you're a conservative who found that to be a pile of crap, then definitely avoid this book, because it is pretty much all scathing criticism of the Bush administration.  <br /> <br />A couple other factors that might influence your purchasing decision: this is also not a book for those who feel uncomfortable/offended by lots of swearing. Also of note, the author's royalties go to a charity that clears landmines from Afghanistan and other areas (though you could just contribute to them directly if you like).	2004-10-28

The Illustrated Longitude has much going for it. Handsomely produced, lovely illustrations, an obscure but interesting topic, and written well in Sobel's engrossing prose. The book seems like a labor of love by an author who is fascinated with her subject, and she passes on some of that enthusiasm to the reader. Well done. <br /> <br />The book is about a problem that we scarcely think about today, in the age of GPS, but was life and death serious in the 18th century: how do you determine where the heck you are when sailing long stretches of open ocean? In other words, how can a ship determine its longitude? Sobel touches on many answers that people proferred, some quackish, some good ideas that were impractical, and one that finally worked well. She touches on many scientists and navigators, but most of the book focuses on John Harrison, a watchmaker who ultimately succeeded in solving the longitude problem. <br /> <br />Sobel faces a difficult task: she needs to elucidate the problem of finding longitude and why it was so difficult to do - but at the same time, not get too bogged down in technical details of astronomy or the mechanics of timepieces... that might be a too difficult for the average reader (like me) with little experience in clock engineering, and might result in some deadly dull prose. For the most part she does well walking this line. As history of science, it informs on the subject m,atter, even without acting as a detailed \\"how to make it work\\" text.  <br /> <br />Where I think the book stumbles is that she tries to mold the quest to discover a longitude method into a grand melodrama, and it just doesn't work, for several reasons. <br /> <br />For one, the main \\"protagonist\\", Harrison, remains rather obscure. While interesting (he was self-taught, and went against the conventional wisdom of the time) not much info is revealed about him, and what is known shows... well, a guy who was rather dull. (Contrast this to another Sobel book, the fine \\"Galileo's Daughter\\", where the titular character and her scientist father both come very much to life.) <br /> <br />Her attempts to craft an \\"antagonist\\" for Harrison out of several government officials also falls flat. She seems to be aiming for more drama than actually was there. (Compare this to the figures from Deborah Cadbury's excellent book \\"Terrible Lizard\\", where the colorful Thomas Huxley humbles Richard Owen, who is revealed in the book to be a true dirtbag, especially in the way he ruins the sympathetic Gideon Mantell. No such personalities or intriguing clashes emerge in Longitude.) <br /> <br />Also, in a method uncomfortably reminiscent of (ick) reality TV, Sobel tries to sell the drama by virtue of the fact that a 20,000 pound prize (very serious money in the 18th century!) is offered for solving the Longitude problem. But by making the conflict of her story one about cash, it gets duller, in my opinion. I would be more intrigued by a conflict over science, to see whose ideas would prove better. Think on this: which do you find more intriguing - a medical researcher searching for the cause or cure of a mysterious disease; or a guy trying to get his HMO to pay the money they owe him for his treatment? Longitude focuses too much on the latter. <br /> <br />Moreover, it isn't exactly as though Harrison got screwed by the Longitude board. He received many government grants for his work, and upon meeting the challenges of the Longitude Prize, he was awarded half the prize, and later the rest. Sobel also falters somewhat in her presentation of the scientific method, oddly enough. When Harrison met the Longitude Prize's requirements, the government only gave him half the prize, demanding that his newly efficient timekeeper be replicated and that it pass additional tests before he receive the full prize. Yes, in one sense this was a ripoff, as those were not part of the contest's requirements, but this was a case where the government was practicing good science. An experiment or technology that can't be replicated would be useless. By playing these demands as the grave injustice that Harrison had to overcome, Sobel comes too close to glorifying a poor execution of the scientific method.  <br /> <br />I give this book an extra star for the excellent illustrations. Photos of Harrison's fascinating timepieces, historical portraits, astronomy diagrams, it's all beautifully done, worthy of a fine coffee table book. The story is an interesting one that is well told, I just feel it would have been better if it weren't oversold, and Sobel hadn't attempted to build up melodrama where little existed.	2004-10-22

By using humor that ultra-snarky, and occasionally just plain goofy, it manages to sneakily make a point and get you to think - sadly far beter than much of the \\"serious\\" media today. <br /> <br />Some reviewers will whine that the book has a political bias... by which they're really saying \\"Boo hoo! It's not biased in favor of MY opinion! Waaah!\\" Indeed, the Daily Show and America the Book takes aim at any target it can find. Liberals, Conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, Americans, other countries, lobbyists, judges, activists... everyone is fair game. Written as a parody of a civics textbook, it also takes aim at the ludicrousness of education. (\\"Were you aware that the Magna Carta was signed in 1215, and that this is the only fact you'll ever be required to know about the Magna Carta?\\") <br /> <br />The book's favorite target is the idiocy of the media. And in an age of Dan \\"Fact checking? Bah!\\" Rather and Fox \\"Fair and Balanced, in the same sense that Mike Tyson is calm and sane\\" News, this is very much needed. The opening page of the book's chapter on the media (opposite a phot of the \\"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" shot from the movie \\"Network\\") is a damning indictment that oughta be framed on every wall in every newsroom in the country. <br /> <br />Above all, the irreverant skewerings are done so well that the book made me laugh. A lot. So pick it up and share the chuckling before you start to fear for your country's future.	2004-10-08
US	49772898	RUGCL4EU7JPG8	0879751983	281452341	Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions	Books	4	167	176	N	N	Not Amazing, but Pretty Good	James Randi is well renowned as one of the world's most prominent skeptics, as well he should be. He has offered a million dollar prize to anyone who can prove in scientifically controlled tests that they possess some kind of paranormal power. Go figure, no one has ever been able to do so, and most self-proclaimed psychics, diviners etc have simply refused to be tested. A common excuse is that 'negative vibrations/energy' from non-believers interfers with their 'powers'. Translation: \\"I can prove I can do anything... as long as it's only to people who are already firmly convinced that I can.\\" <br /> <br />This book's most interesting sections include accounts of some people who have tried to claim this prize, and often descriptions of the trickery they tried to pull. Famous scams and flim-flammery are also discussed. The perpetrators range from the honestly mistaken, to those manipulated by others (including children) to the deluded to the knowing liars. It's not a read that will lift your opinion of humanity, but it's well worth reading. <br /> <br />The book is not without its flaws. Randi is correctly portrayed as pissed off - and given the insistent idiocy he deals with, perhaps that's no surprise. The topics veer through a hodgepodge of the allegedly paranormal, making it read a little too episodic. At times, the prose gets dry. For example, the chapter on the Cottingly Faeries goes into technical details about cameras, which I had a tough time understanding. <br /> <br />Worth noting are some false claims that negative reviewers have made on Amazon. Randi does NOT maintain a dogmatic insistance that all paranormal claims are false. He bases his belief that such claims are hooey not on faith, but on evidence, having seen many (many, many) which are false, and none that have proven true. That's merely rational thinking. He does not claim \\"There are no paranormal powers and I can prove it.\\" One cannot prove a negative like that. [Quick: can you play the tuba? Canyou PROVE to me that you can't?] Moreover, the burden of proof does not lie with him. If I say I can fly like Superman, you say I can't... who do you think should be assumed correct barring evidence about my claim? <br /> <br />This book is a good one for those who value rational thinking. There are others that are better written (To name just a few: Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon Haunted World\\", Robert Park's \\"Voodoo Science\\" and Randi's own, more focused \\"The Faith Healers\\") but I still give it high marks.	2004-09-03

Today, nations of Europe (or European descent, ie the U.S.) dominate the world. They have the most economic, military and political power. Why?  <br /> <br />For example, Europeans ended up completely conquering the Americas. Why did that happen, instead of Native Americans conquering Europe? The obvious answer is this book's title. The Europeans had better weapons, better technology, better national organization, and were vectors for more lethal diseases (most notably smallpox). But why did those conquering advantages develop in Europe rather than the Americas (or Africa or Australia)? <br /> <br />Diamond's answer boils down to geography. In short, the Eurasian landmass had advantages that the other continents lacked. More domesticatable plants (leading to more success in the agricultural revolution). More domesticatable animals (assisting with farming, labor, war - and the aforementioned germs). An east-west axis, with less severe geographic barriers (ie Africa being cut off by the sahara) allowing agriculture and technology to spread. <br /> <br />He explores these factors, and others, in detail. He cites evidence to support his case: biological, archaeological, linguistic. He also takes us on a brief history of human history over the last 13,000 years, and convincingly attacks racist views that whites took over because other people are stupider. (Noting, for example, that people in all parts of the world domesticated pretty much every plant possible - even modern technology hasn't improved on our old record in that area. If you were unlucky enough to live where there were few such domesticatable flora... you had a problem.) <br /> <br />On the downside, while Diamond makes his argument convincing, he perhaps tried too hard to do so, and ends up repeating his points a bit. The topic is, of course, a vast, incredibly complicated one, and he speaks in general terms on some points, often simplifying a certain subject  (but to his credit, admits when he is doing so).  <br /> <br />There is a lot of interesting history to be learned here, and it is well argued and well written. If the topic interests you, this book will will clearly whet your apetite to learn more.	2004-09-03

It has its fair share of funniness, sharp wit, and politically trenchant observation. Right-wingers probably won't find it funny, but if like seeing the powerful criticized via mocking humor, you'll probably like this. <br />  <br /> But there are several detriments to the strip, even if you agree with McGruder's political and social outlook. He gets a lot of credit for presenting a minority perspective in the comics (certainly a good thing) but maybe too much - he's not totally alone in this. Perhaps your local paper doesn't carry &quot;Curtis&quot; or &quot;Baldo&quot;.  <br />  <br /> There are many occasions when he gets so worked up about the point he's making that he seemingly doesn't bother to even include any joke to it. There are times when the strip reads less like a comic, more like a shouted rant. <br />  <br /> It doesn't help that McGruder doesn't draw facial expressions well - Huey Freeman usually looks the same whether he's supposed to be angry (most common), surprised, amused or whatever. The characters simply don't emote via the illustrations. (I have high hopes for &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;, written by McGruder but drawn by a far superior artist Kyle Baker.) <br />  <br /> Lastly, character development has fallen by the wayside in favor of the politics. Doonesbury, for example, is highly political --- but the characters get to develop personalities and histories, and Trudeau lets the politics can thus be brought out from a personal angle (ie BD losing a leg in Iraq). McGruder doesn't bother with this approach and has let interesting/funny supporting characters disappear. <br />  <br /> Boondocks makes me laugh relatively often, I like it, but I wouldn't rate it as one of the great strips.	2004-07-30

It's a little hard to understand why this became such a mega-bestseller and cultural phenom.<br />Dan Brown gives us a by-the-numbers thriller. It jazzes things up with a lot of puzzle clues the reader can try to solve with the characters - and some are clever enough. He also adds in some semi-interesting socio-historical perspectives on religion and art. Combined with the easy reading style of the prose, that can explain some level of interest.<br />But then there are the downsides to the novel, and there are many.<br />The quality of the writing is really bad in many places. The dialogue resembles nothing actual people would say. Typical \\"conversation\\":<br />#1: \\"[supposedly shocking revelation]\\"<br />#2: \\"Are you trying to tell me that [supposedly shocking revelation]???\\"<br />#3: \\"Yes, I am saying [supposedly shocking revelation]\\"<br />It goes on and on like that, and it gets irritating, as does the ham-handed way Brown tries to hold off on revealing information until it's (supposedly) more dramatic. The book takes itself VERY seriously, without a trace of wit or style. Rather than say \\"this could symbolize that\\", the characters always have to say \\"when one looks at it symbologically\\". (\\"Symbologist\\", and its permutations, seems to be a presumtuous word the book enjoys using ad nauseum to inflate its own importance.)<br />One of the \\"big secrets\\" - about what one character saw another doing ten years ago - is a yawner of an anticlimax. The main protagonists register absolute zero on the personality meter. Absolute zero also describes the amount of heat they generate, though of course they end up together.<br />Brown also plays fast and loose with real life stuff. Did you ever have a college professor who always declared that his one, overarching theory explained absolutely everything? That's what goes on here. Brown throws in enough real-life people, groups, events, art etc to make his fictional work sound legit, but mixes it with pure fiction - maybe hoping you won't be able to tell the difference.<br />[One real laugher: Isaac Newton is repeatedly mentioned in the plot. In real life, Newton was deeply anti-social, devoutly Christian and almost certainly died a virgin. His biographer, James Gleick, describes the physicist's attitude towards sex as \\"morbid distaste.\\" The Da Vinci Code posits Newton as part of a pagan group that worships the \\"sacred feminine\\" - another phrase Brown beats to death - and engages in ritual sex. Yeah, right.]<br />It's not the worst thing I've ever read, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.ork sound legit, but mixes it with pure fiction - maybe hoping you won't be able to tell the difference.<br />[One real laugher: Isaac Newton is repeatedly mentioned in the plot.

It's also a tough branch of science to grasp. What's the difference between DNA, a gene, a chromosome and a genome? How much of a role does genetics play in your health - is DNA destiny? <br />This book is a solid introduction to understanding genetics: the basics of the science, the history of humanity's knowledge of it, how it relates to other fields (ie evolution) - all explained well, in both word and the highly helpful illustrations. As always, Gonick tosses in some humor with his cartoons, but don't be fooled into thinking this is kid stuff. He delves into serious science.

Not that it was horrible or anything, but it was nowhere near as good as The Goblet of Fire. (minor spoilers below...)<br />Good stuff: This is the most heavily character-based book of the series so far. It's not just the big 3 (Harry, Ron, Hermione) who get face-time - the other kids, teachers, the members of the Order and even the Dursleys all get flushed out, generally to good effect. The new villainess of the piece is well and truly contemptible - I was happy to see her suffer defeats. The overall ambiance of fear and paranoia was well done and appropriate, given what happened in book 4. Rowling's easy-going writing is still quite readable, and several scenes (notably teen Snape meeting teen James Potter) were powerful and sometimes chilling.<br />Bad Stuff: Two main things cut down my enjoyment of the book. For starters, in such a huge tome, surprisingly little happens. There's no central element driving the plot (ala the trwizard tournament, finding what's petrifying people etc) and the storyline, such as it is, leaves the book little different at the end than the start. Think about it: in the first 4 books (especially #4) when the plot comes together at the end, you can go back and see all the clues and foreshadowing that were leading up to it, where all the red herrings led into minor elements of their own, all good. Nothing like that happens here. At all. The \\"big secret\\" that is revealed at the end is woefully underwhelming. Plus, stuff that should have gotten a bit more page time is glossed over quickly. In the denouement, one event fans have been waiting/hoping for happens, with barely any mention.<br />The second problem is Harry himself. Throughout the book he's angry, verbally abusive, sullen... not very likable. Yes, I know, he's becoming a teen and is definitely under stress and has reason to be in a bad mood given all that's happened/happening.... except that his mood never changes. Other characters step upfor Harry with friendship and loyalty, in a big way, but this seems to bounce off him like water off a duck. And at the story's end, he's pretty much in the same state, no growth or evolution of his character occurs.<br />Here's hoping Rowling gets a little more back in the groove in book 6.	2003-06-28

Don't criticize him for that. He does not, however, have the right to publish his opinion and forbid others from offering their own. So feel free to lambast him for being a huge bigot, which he certainly is.<br />2) How interesting that Buchanan sees declining birthrates as such a peril for the white, hetero, christian, uber-conservative way of life he so cherishes. Buchanan himself has no children. There's a word for that....	2002-04-21
US	49772898	R2PXVKZPVV84HH	0525946357	476723752	The Crocodile Hunter: The Incredible Life and Adventures of Steve and Terri Irwin	Books	3	14	15	N	N	Crocodile Rock	Steve Irwin, Animal Planet's &quot;Crocodile Hunter&quot;, and his wife/co-star Terri, bring their wildlife adventures to book form, and it works pretty well.<br />The hardback book has excellent production value - glossy pages and loads of color photos. Very niuce, and informative if you don't know what a perentie looks like.<br />Steve's persona on tv - that of the highly excitable wildman who picks up venomous snakes and wrestles gigantic crocodiles - is no act. He describes it as merely having an enthusiasm for wildlife, and that enthusiasm is contagious. The book tells of how he developed this love of animals (basically, he was raised with it). Terri tells of how they met and fell head over heels in love at first sight. On their first date, Steve told her &quot;You're not at all ladylike!&quot; (which he meant as a compliment, it's sweet, in a weird way). <br />Neither of the Irwins are particularly stylish writers. The phrase &quot;passion for wildlife&quot; is repeated often, making the text occasionally sound repetetive, though not insincere. Still, both are gifted storytellers. Just like their tv show, the book draws you in to their world. You feel like you're right there with them trying to save a giant reptile that's trying to rip you apart.<br />If the book has a shortcoming (aside from the minor fact that some of the tales will be familiar to regular viewers of the tv show) it's that it is too short. Steve does impart a good deal of knowledge about his beloved wildlife, but could have explained more. For example, he tells that apex predators like crocodiles are key to the health of an ecosystem - true, but he doesn't elaborate on why. Terri tells informative and fascinating anecdotes about caring for a wide variety of creatures at the Australia Zoo. I wanted more of those.<br />Overall, the book does a good job in its primary mission: making you interested in animals, so that you'll care enough to try to fight for their survival.	2002-02-28
US	49772898	R1RAUOO6PJMCN8	0767908473	495549695	The Sorcerer's Companion: A Guide to the Magical World of Harry Potter	Books	4	202	204	N	N	Folklore 101	This is a good book that covers a lot of basic mythology, folklore, superstition and history, and (tangentally) connects it to the Harry Potter series.<br />First, the good stuff: it includes a lot of entries (accurate - so far as I can tell) about a lot of supernatural creatures, beliefs and other topics. Want to know the different mythologies of the phoenix from different countries, and which parts J.K. Rowling made up for her books? It's here. Want to know the historical beliefs about unicorns, how they differ from the &quot;classical&quot; interpretation of the glowing white horse with the long slender horn, when (and possibly how) these beliefs came about? You got it. <br />Also good: there are many helpful illustrations. The writers treat the superstitious beliefs of different times and places with a certain respect, not saying &quot;man, they were idiots for believing in ghosts!&quot; or anything like that. But skeptics won't be disappointed, either. For example, when frankly talking about how many alchemists were charlatans who only pretended to create gold with the &quot;sorceror's stone&quot; (or, more accurately, the philosopher's stone) --- it even tells you HOW it was possible to fake this wondrous transmutation. Nice.<br />On to the bad stuff... actually, not BAD stuff, but things you should know the books is NOT about.<br />While it uses the Harry Potter books as a jumping off point, it doesn't really go into depth about the HP series. For example, no entries on Argus, Remus or Minerva (despite some famous residents of Hogwarts who bear those names, often as none-too-subtle cues on their characters). It won't comment on the (rather obvious) symbolism of Dumbledore having a pet phoenix, when one of his hallmarks is giving people a second chance. <br />[Still, it's rather disturbing to read the negative reviews of some people on Amazon who refused to read the book simply because it was about the mythology of magic, and not enough about Harry + co. Don'tget me wrong - I love Rowling's work. I bet she'd be a little dismayed to learn that her writing has caused some readers to be interested in only her writing, and not inspired them to read more about different, if related, subjects.]<br />The book also shouldn't been seen as an in-depth guide to mythology, but then, it wouldn't be easy for any one volume to do that. Vampires, for example, get 2 pages here, but whole books could be written just on the mythology of vamps in different cultures (and pop culture).<br />There's some mention of literature - Bram Stoker is referenced in the vampire entry, the one on cauldron's refers to the famous &quot;eye of newt&quot; scene in MacBeth. But there's only a little of this. No commentary on the influence of, say, Tolkien, on Rowling's work.<br />Including &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in the title of this book is quite possibly a bid to increase sales. That being said, it's a good read, and a solid intro to the mythology of the magical.	2002-01-04
US	49772898	R3SJT2W39RPNM1	9652292494	378828480	But He Was Good to His Mother: The Lives and Crimes of Jewish Gangsters	Books	3	37	40	N	N	Big Tsuris	A seldom-covered aspect of true crime history and Jewish history, &quot;But He was Good to His Mother&quot; is a fine read for anyone interested in either. It delves into the histories of several gangsters, their misdeeds, relationships to the Jewish community and anecdotes that shed some light on what these crimelords were really like. Plenty of photos are included.<br />Rockaway does a fairly good job of striking a balance in tackling a delicate subject. He points out the occasional admirable deeds of the gangsters (protecting American Jews from anti-semites, for example) while making it quite clear that these were very bad men. He fesses up that these killers and lawbreakers were admired by some in the community, but by no means all. <br />Occasionally, books about influential Jews get a little hokey when they gush over how the values of the Jewish community produced so many great people. (As though, without centuries of respect for learning by the Jews, Einstein might never have come up with relativity; whatever.) As a Jew myself, I think it feels more honest and refreshing to see it acknowledged that these same values and shared history produced some no-goodniks along the way, too. And ones who broke the stereotypes about Jews at that.<br />If anything, I'd have liked more information, more stories about the gangsters in the book. Especially nice would have been more on their role in the general public's perception and pop culture. The book doesn't tell you that the purple gang was infamous enough to be mentioned in Elvis Presley's JailHouse Rock, no opinion on who did a better job of playing Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth in &quot;Hoodlum&quot; or James Remar in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;?), no word on whether Mickey Cohen was really as daft as James Ellroy portrays him, no mention of &quot;Bugsy&quot; or &quot;The Godfather, part 2&quot;.<br />Still, I liked the book. I wouldn't label it an offer you can't refuse, but it's an offer it wouldn't kill you to accept.	2001-12-24

Confidential	Books	4	62	68	N	N	Comparing book to movie (no real spoilers)	I had seen the superb movie (several times) before reading this book, and wondered how the two would compare. Ellroy's novel is also superb, and in some ways the movie reads direcrtly from it (much dialogue lifted verbatim) but there are large differences.<br />Fit into a couple hours and what feels like a year's worth of time, the movie is more concise. The book is far more sprawling, taking place over almost a decade --- and it connects to both the prequel (The Big Nowhere, excellent) and sequel (White Jazz, also excellent). The screenwriters actually did a fine job capturing the essence of the book while truncating the plot.<br />The book is, of course, far more involved, with more seamy threads, the plot much more byzantine. I was having a tough time figuring out how the Evil Scheme tied together, but Ellroy does a surprisingly good job of tying it together in a short time at the end, so read closely and stick with it.<br />The book's larger scope lets the three main characters get more face time and more depth. Not to slight Guy Pearce's fine performance, but Ed Exley is a whole new level of fascinating here. And Jack Vincenes isn't quite the super-slick hepcat that Kevin Spacey memorably embodied. Bud White is far less restrained than Russell Crowe made him look. The actors who played smaller roles in the movie (James Cromwell, Danny Devito and David Straithairn) were dead on.<br />Ellroy's prose is a thing of beauty, with its raw expose of violence and corruption and 50's slang (though not quite as polished or stylized as in White Jazz). While the movie was chock-full of badness, it didn't come close to the book. For those unfamiliar with the author: let's put it mildly and say he doesn't have a good opinion of human nature. No nice guys here.<br />If you like down and dirty crime fiction or film noir at all, this is the book for you. Personally, I'd recommend reading The Big Nowhere first, and then White Jazz, for a terrific trio of ungoodness.	2001-11-05

So I was looking forward to Omerta. I was disappointed.<br />Not totally disappointed, as there are some things about it that I liked. Puzo's tight prose reads well, and his descriptions of things ranging from food to chilling violence often carry you away. Parts of the novel, especially those that delve into the characters' histories, start to make them come alive.<br />But there are other parts, and far too many of them, that are big letdowns. Not giving anything away, but one key character in the plot has a bombastically megalomaniacal motivation that feels very much out of place. The Don's children seem mere shadows of well developed characters - a far cry from the kids of Don Corleone or Don Clericuzio! At one point, a woman's dogs are killed and she says: &quot;Our poor dogs!&quot; It seems to me more likely she'd say &quot;Oh, poor Spot and Rover!&quot; and Puzo just didn't bother coming up with names for the ill-fated canines. About 8 zillion characters are described as &quot;charming&quot; - but they do nothing to convince the reader that this is an accurate assessment. (&quot;Show, don't tell&quot;, every writing student is admonished. I wish Puzo had taken that advice.) The book's ending reads like the script to one of the countless lame action movies Hollywood foists on us.<br />You probably won't hate it, but I wouldn't recommend it.	2001-09-22
US	49772898	R233XW4ZX9YV90	0140280553	654799136	Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love	Books	3	81	84	N	N	What is and isn't	Sobel's biography of Galileo does many things. As a result, it doesn't cover any one of its aspects in tremendous depth, but does do a good job of covering each of them. This also helps make the book more enjoyable to read. A straight up, full frontal discussion of the great scientist's theories on motion would have been tough for a reader not well-versed in math and physics. By contrast, when Sobel talks about Galileo's scientific breakthroughs, it's clear what the subject is, even if some details are left out. <br />It also hits some new territtory in its revealing of Galileo, the person, especially his relationship with his daughter. Her correspondence with him shows a woman of ironclad (almost self-flagellating) faith, devoted love for her father (which he clearly shared) and the two of them as just ordinary folks who worry not only about the movement of earth, but also about the laundry. Galileo is also is shown to have a sense of humor; when fined for not wearing his uniform at university, he circulated a tongue-in-cheek poem asking if clothes were really necessary at all.<br />The book also does a nice job of illuminating Galileo's true greatest feat - changing our definition of &quot;science&quot;. In his time, the &quot;natural philosophers&quot; held that the universe was unchanging, that math was useless as a tool to describe the world, and that &quot;if Aristotle said it, it must be true.&quot; These concepts are total anathema to science today, thanks largely to Galileo, who disproved them.<br />With due respect, I'd also like to correct a few errors in some other reviews. Galileo's book &quot;A Treatise on the Tides&quot;, did indeed try to use the tides to prove that the earth was not stationary in space. But he claimed that it was earth's motion which caused tides, not the Moon. (He was incorrect, as it IS the moon which causes tides. Newton was the one who discovered this.) This is just one example of science as a constantly evolving, self-editing process. Even the great minds - be they Aristotle or Galileo or Newton - could make mistakes.<br />Moreover, it would be wrong to characterize this book as anti-Catholic. There's no denying that the 17th century Church was often tyranic and anti-rational. &quot;Galileo's Daughter&quot; doesn't try to whitewash that. But the Church's persecution of Galileo is shown to not merely be a case of religion vs. science (tho that played a part) but also a personal and political struggle. Nor was the Church a monolithic entity. While Pope Urban VIII pursued Galileo with a vengeance, many churchmen continued to support him, even after his condemnation. For that matter, the book's titular character, who comes off as downright angelic, was a nun.<br />Overall, this is a good read for those interested in science or history.	2001-08-05

He criticizes them, justifiably and intelligently, for doing a poor job. As he sees it, zoos should be able to help animals and truly educate people about nature (of which fauna are just one part), but most often they don't do so well enough.<br />He goes through the history of zoos, from ancient menageries to Disney's Animal Kingdom, and shows how that history relates to political, religious and scientific trends. He explains lucidly how zoos should (and sometimes do) interlock zoology with conservation, botany, geology, architecture and other fields. He doles out praise to various institutions when merrited - which is in several cases, but sadly, far outweighed by the times when zoos have failed. It's time to start doing a better job, while there's still time.<br />This book will give you a lot of food for thought, and make you see animals and nature and zoos in a new light. It will makes you see zoos' flaws, but also their potential.	2001-06-17

Not for nothing has he been called &quot;the funniest  man in America&quot;. But how would his work go over in the form of a  fictional novel?<br />Pretty darn well, it turns out. Dripping with the  influence of Elmore Leonard, this tale of common folks and uncommon  lowlives in South Florida also is infused with Barry's signature comedy.  And it's only slightly less absurdist than in his columns.<br />The characters  are colorful, but the ending is somewhat telegraphed. No surprises on what  the ultimate fate of any of the characters turns out to be. But I didn't  care. The pandomeum of the plot twists may be wacky, but Barry manages to  write them better and with more credibility than some professional  action/thriller writers do in some of their books. (&quot;Hannibal&quot; is  coming to mind.)<br />It's a fun read, summer or no. At the end, one  character's reaction to learning what's in the suitcase echoed my own.	2000-09-04

After all, time can't even be defined, only measured. He jumps around a number of  related topics - the science behind watches, computers and more, and a  lucid assessment &quot;hurry sickness&quot; in society. All interesting  stuff. Loved when he cited the best example of contemporary impatience:  that some people press elevator call buttons repeatedly, even this doesn't  do a damn thing to make it arrive sooner. (Yeah, I do it, too.)<BR><BR>Some  reviewers have (fairly) stated that by the end the book seems less  analytical and almost ranty. It is also written like a series of essays,  rather than a whole book, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  <BR><BR>It also helps Gleick avoid a wee small pitfall of his earlier  works: being a little TOO enamored of his subject. As great as  &quot;Chaos&quot; was, it was occassionally annoying with phrases like  this: &quot;Before Chaos, knuckle-scraping neaderthal mathematicians could  barely add 1 + 1. Today, thanks to Chaos, the super-brained Math People can  cause money to materialize out of thin air just by thinking of it.&quot;  [OK, I know I exagerate. But not by a lot.]<BR><BR>Faster reads well (dare  I say 'quickly'?) and provides food for thought.	2000-06-08

I've seen the movie, of course, and I have seen some of illustrator Eric Shanower's work (very good here).<BR><BR> The concept seemed a tough one to pull off; I  know enough to know that Oz is a fantasy-based universe, while Einhorn's  plot uses time travel, alternate universes --- the stuff of science  fiction. The two styles don't always mix well. [Example: Star Wars takes  sci-fi stuff like spaceships, galactic empires etc and mixes it with the  mystical jedi knights; this is good. The Phantom Menace tells us that the  jedis' abilities with the force are based on microbes in their blood; this  is lame.]<BR><BR> For the most part, it works in Paradox in Oz. In a world  with such famous absurdist characters as a cowardly lion, Einhorn's  additions such as the Parrot-Ox and the Man Who Lives Backwards fit right  in. The logical conundrums are often quite cleverly done, and the plot ties  together nicely (pay attention and you may see it coming; I didn't til the  very end.)<BR><BR> This is a good book for the young or young at heart. I  wouldn't say it's too dark for kids (come on - think of ANY fairy tale and  there's menacing stuff) but I suspect some children might get a bit  confused by some of the paradoxes.<BR><BR> And, a bit of a paradox itself,  I couldn't help but smile at the fact that all of the characters have no  problem expositing frequently - including Glinda. If she'd been that  forthcoming to Dorothy at the start of The Wizard of Oz (&quot;Oh, just  click the shoes to go home&quot;) the whole movie never would have  happened.     :)	2000-06-01

As I scanned the other reviews of this book, I found that I couldn't agree less with many of them... but did agree with parts. Don't know what that says about different peoples' perceptions of this book.<BR>I'll start by  saying I liked all of Gibson's previous work and I liked Idoru, too. I was  a little stunned to read some people who seemed to find it went on too  long, as the hardback edition I read is under 300 pages (large print,  breaks between chapters.) The plot is admittedly simple: rock star plans to  marry a virtual reality character. When do computers become alive? ---  recurring theme for Gibson.<BR> Rather than tell it from the POV of these  two lovebirds, he alternates chapters between the book's two main  characters. One, Chia, is a teen fan. One, Laney, has the the strange  talent of... to put it in contemporary terms, he can separate the signal  from the noise when websurfing. (That &gt;would&lt; be a useful skill!)<BR>  Things I liked? While the plot is straightforward, I preferred it to more  overarching books that start out well and have things crumble by the end.  There have been plenty of those. Second, I found the charactrers all well  defined and appealing, especially Laney, a sort of everyman who ends up in  the middle of a lot of weird stuff.<BR> And of course, there's Gibson's  writing, powerful and at times even hypnotic. Each chapter reads like a  story unto itself, but they do all move towards a clear resolution. Even  the title seemed like a subtle commentary on the story. (&quot;Idoru&quot;  = &quot;I adore you&quot;, perhaps?) <BR>I give it a big thumbs-up.	2000-05-20

Too bad that the state of affairs which angers her so bears no resemblance whatsoever to reality. In Rand-vision, for example, the most  oppressed people in the world are the super-wealthy. Forget the philosophy  and politics for a moment, and ask yourself whether the people you think  have gotten really screwed by life resemble Warren Buffet.<BR><BR>  Considering this as a novel, it's blessed awful. Droning prose (that goes  on for FAR too long in MANY passages), and a plot that reads like a  self-indulgent persecution fantasy. Not only do Rand's protagonists get to  whine about how unfair they've been treated, they get to take over the  world, form their own private club that owns everything, and crow - among  other absurdities - about how much better they are in the sack than the  idiots who disagree with them. Please.<BR><BR>From a political standpoiunt,  if you want a novel that tears a new one for communism, read Orwell's  &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. It's much better written, and is much more in tune  with the real world, even though it features talking animals... which says  a lot about how out there Rand is.	2000-05-15

Well, it is indeed surprisingly  prescient about future technology. But that's the only good thing to be  said about it.<br /><br /> The plot is flimsy at best, the characters have no  appeal and the overall tone is one of self-indulgent whining. Incessantly  so. Oh, how awful a world would be if certain poets ever failed to be  lionized! The same list of poets repeated ad nauseum.<br /><br /> In short,  don't waste your time on this. If you want a well-written book that shows a  dystopian future with a culture-technology clash, read Aldous Huxley's  Brave New World or Ray Bradbury's Farrenheit 451.	2000-04-29
