This compelling story is stuffed with characters that you simply cant get enough of:  Puck, BuenaVista, and of course Cassie herself and her family of women.  Her sister Belle is going one way -- toward success and accomplishment? - her mother is a Greek tragic figure with a pack of Camels and a heart that still understands love -- and Cassie goesout into the world to kick a little ___.  Well done and so magical to enter her world, Kimmel has triumphed here with exquisite grace and plenty of humor.	2004-02-23

What strikes me as immediately pleasant and refreshing is the fact that it has a timeless quality - the small towns, the simple lives, the beauty of a good story well told.  There are no ambitious husband-seeking female characters, no thinly veiled and politically correct &quot;messages&quot;, no references to designer clothing or celebrities.  Her simple style is reminiscent of Willa Cather, yet the bursts of the human comedy and the unique yet 'ordinary people' characters remind me of how Pat Conroy hooks in a reader.   Yet Kimmel's voiceis her own and it shines with an elegant subtlety, her dialogue is flawless.  Characetsr liek BuenaVisa and Puck and Belle keep this book firmly on the sacred groundof Truth.  Laura has many of the best lines and the kind of elder wisdom that is rarely seen in today's novels.   It is simply and extraordinary book and I hope it gets the recognition it so richly deserves.	2004-01-10

Something Rising is studded with the kind of characters that seem to emerge whole from the pages:  Puck, Jimmy, and of course Cassie are so real one feels they could touch them -- and we in the reading are surely touched.  Cassie's redemption is a fierce will and the gift her father passed along:   pool (billiards to the brits).  The story is so compelling and funny and sad that it briskly engulfs the reader in a tide of lyrical bliss.  Laura's speech about the Holiness of Love is surely one of the finest to ever grace my eyes.  The novel is a mystery as well, careening through some agile plots twists until its grand finale.  Brilliant, absorbing, tender, and uniquely satisfying, Ms. Kimmel has triumphed again.	2004-01-05

Postcards From The Edge defined its time, and now after an elegant absence Ms. Fisher once more sets pen to page to amuse the rest of us mortals.  Tackling the subject of manic depression is something only teh very brave and the very eloquent would assume; luckily for readers, she is both.  I believe history bears this out...and The Best Awful is a great read, as well as a wonderful quasi-rebuttal to her father's conceit of a \\"biography\\" whose name hardly bears mentioning.  Eddie Fisher.  Proof that there is a Goddess, and that she has smiled again upon those of us who sprang from less-than-ideal loins (although i adore and respect Debbie Reynolds - a great talent and a survivor) and survived drugs, alcohol and other various maladies to triumph.  Well done, Ms. Fisher.  You rock.	2004-01-03

Having read the original and liked its quirky, flawed movements, I am now absolutely savoring this rewrite.  It is a full novel, rounded and studded with unforgettable characters like the elderly Jessie (the car driving scene - the long one - isi sidesplittingly funny), the romantic but wise Lou, and of course the charming and lovely young Willie, whom we all know out there somewhere, the eternal boy-man.  Oh it's all pure delight.   Fey to the naysayers!  A perfect read for the intelligent reader who doesnt need a Hollywood plot or a pat ending.  I will not,howvever, be satisfied until Anne writes a sequel to Rae's character in Rosie.  We need the Rae book, Annie!  We honestly do.  All hail Lamott, writer for women (and men)  who think.	2003-11-27

It has the wit and soft spoken charm that speaks to children as well as adults.  The storyline is no sachharine tale --- instead it uses reality and real characters to illustrate the finer points of love and synchronicity and the need to not judge by appearance.  Parents who want their children to grow up with wise and age-appropriate books will want to get Orville. I've also purchased extra copies for my nieces and nephews.  A lovely, strong and moralistic tale.  The artwork was fresh and evocative as well. <br />Other titles I recommend are Crictor by Tomi Ungerer and also Moon Man by Tomi Ungerer.  The McDuff series is also very fine and lovely (that made me want a dog also)  Enjoy!	2003-11-23

Yes, Operating Instructions has some political points of view but it's really nothing compared to the meat of the book: a new life and a best friend's illness, both honestly told, striking at the core of the human heart.   The Zygote Chronicles has more laugh out loud moments but this one has a huge amount of heart, in my opinion.  I also loved Bird by Bird, also by Anne Lamott.	2003-11-07

It was a superlative book, very compelling and unique in its voice, and it stands up well to time.  As to the recent trend of fiction with engagement as its topic ( as well as motherhood ), look to Suzanne Finnamore (Otherwise Engaged, The Zygote Chronicles) or Jennifer Weiner, (Good in Bed, In Her Shoes) who at least can write their way out of a wedding dress.	2003-06-05

It's so great to see women authors opening the Pandora box that is motherhood, and breaking the silence.  The Big Rumpus is a quick, light read that illuminates the travails of motherhood with uncommon wit and candor.  The Zygote Chronicles, by Suzanne Finnamore, is another must-read in this genre -- not as fluffy and sweet, but just as hilarious and startlingly poignant as well.

This is not a strictly urban read, it should resonate with any reader who has struggled with addictive tendencies, personal demons, or an unexpected U turn in the road of fortune.

It was wonderful.....	last week, a winter storm brought down power lines in my neighborhood and plunged me into a blackout for five days.  luckily, i had my first edition of BLUE SHOE to tide me over until the power went back on.  it was crucial to my well being, and for that I thank Ms. Lamott.<br />BLUE SHOE offers Lamott's trademark array of real-life characters that endear one to them in much the same way that Anne Tyler's do; we relate to these people because they are not shiny and happy lobotomized versions of human beings -- deeply flawed, they struggle to the surface of their lives as we root them on, never quite knowing what will happen next.  No cookie-cutter relationships here, thank GOD. although I am not religious, I didn't feel alienated by the christianity references -- this is hardly OLD TESTAMENT stuff, just a gentle sea current of spirituality that threads its way through the text.  my favorite passages seemed to squeeze time sideways, protracting the moments in the character's lives that plot is made of.  of particular sensitivity and beauty is Lamott's portrayal of Abby, and the tenuous relationship with her dead father which resolves itself by the end of the novel in a way that can be understood and believed in.  All in al,l I got the same feeling of well being and good company that each of Lamotts novels have stirred in me.  the fact that she makes it look easy does not mean that it IS easy to write about complex moral dillemmas and family secrets with such style and grace.  I found the final pages of the book to be glorious and I was saddened to arrive at the last page.  Closing the book with a full and round feeling of  contentment, I found myself wondering whether, after all the agnostic nonsense and harsh petty criticism leveled at her on this site, Lamott will do us the honor of another novel soon.  Let us hope that she does.<br />Annie -- you rock.  --  Eve	2002-12-20

US	49992802	R3TRKIZTJTS2C6	0684859769	855011156	Transformation Soup: Healing for the Splendidly Imperfect	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	it's all about slow cooking	great book for women going through a divorce, as it teaches us to flow with life and nurture our selves, in ways this culture rarely gives permission for.  sometimes at night it's good to turn off the tv and just take the sark journey.  she really is amazing, in that she has made art/writing out of self expression and she encourages others to find their growth and creative side.  healing is an overused word, but this book gives you real methods, not to mention blessed permission.	2000-11-04

I've read her latest two books and everyone recommended this one.  I am so glad I bought it - every character has facets that develop artfully and with great tenderness before your eyes.  She is a master storyteller.  Read everything she writes.......	2000-10-19

US	49992802	R1S0B6NQ6N2W3I	0679767959	430418898	Heartburn	Books	5	13	15	N	N	One of my all-time favorite novels	this book would be worth the price of admission were it simply to contain  the life-saving pototo recipes and their droll commentary.  it would not be  an exagerration to say I've read this book more often than I care to admit  -- its wit, poignancy, and page-turning vivacity make it a modern classic,  especially for women.  I also enjoyed the film -- it's difficult to dislike  anything that stars meryl streep and jack nicholson; and the music by carly  simon was memorable.  read the book, then rent the movie.  you won;t be  disappointed.....	2000-09-04

I  emphasize with her pain and know that she is somewhere doing terrifically  now, having shed herself (though unwillingly : as women, we will fight for  our loves and our families especially beyond reason) of a man who could not  go the distance.  I feel that he is recreating his stuff with a new face,  but what he left behind can never be replaced or compensated for.   catherine has her family and her life and the knowledge that she gave  everything she could for what she believed in....that's a lot.  and she  will triumph, with or without a man.  I know this by her writing and by the  courage it took to bare herself so openly in her work.	2000-09-04
