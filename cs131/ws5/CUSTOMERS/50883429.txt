It's a large-format board book, making it suitable for young and unsteady hands. The gimmick is that in the center of the book is a soft plastic monster that flashes its LED eyes and electronically growls when you push its tummy.<br /><br />There is also a story and artwork, but they seem almost beside the point. If your child is a little too young for \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" this may be just the ticket!	2005-09-15

Is it an animal story? Is it SF? Is it Biblical? Is it environmental?<br /><br />It's just a story. Young kids don't care about adult categories; they just like stories. The illustrations are bright and, like the storyline, free from adult conventions. The spaceship doesn't look like Star Trek, nor should it.<br /><br />This book is not for adults. It jars our nerves because we see that the author is trying to draw a lesson about the harmony of the Old Testament and environmentalism. But  who cares? For kids ... it's just a basic \\"journey there-and-back-again\\" storybook to enjoy. If they pick up some other stuff too, well enough, but give them a break ... there's time enough for education another day!	2005-05-30

The main character, Timmy, is simply someone for the reader to follow on a trip across the Pacific in a flying boat. This craft may be wholly fantastic to children of today, who may leap the ocean in a single (very long day) whereas Timmy's China Clipper must visit several islands on the way.<br /><br />The book's drawings, both black-and-white and color, describe the flying craft itself as well as the islands that children of today skip over: Guam, Wake Island, Midway, as well as Manila, Hong Kong and Hawai'i. Timmy has a few adventures which add interest, but this is not a plot-driven book; rather it is to be read and enjoyed for the journey. Timmy and his point of view are nearly as antique as hobbits, yet may be almost as interesting for their bygonity.	2005-05-20

This book is a fine example of the principle.<br /><br />Because it is based on a well-known nursery rhyme or song involving lots of repetition, this book can not have a whole lot of surprise in its pop-ups; from the title, you can pretty much guess that they will all involve someone exiting the bed one way or another. And you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />However, the pop-up mechanics work just fine in service to the story. The illustrations are nice and amusing, and the various \\"...and one fell out...\\" mechanics vary enough to keep interest.<br /><br />Most of all, the re-reading value of this book does not depend on the pop-ups; they are fun enough, but it's the well-worn nursery song that children enjoy over and over, using the pop-ups or ignoring them as the whim strikes. That makes the book a solid choice for early readers.<br /><br />But be warned .... if the song drives you batty, this book won't help at-all!!!	2005-05-20

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Teach Your Children Well ...	... each generation has its musical heroes who have their time at the top, and then must give way to the next. Some retire to a well-earned obscurity; some suffer through endless \\"Monsters Of Rock\\" tours; a happy few move on to other creative endeavours.<br /><br />This book comes from a man who has moved on. Building on his experience as a working musician, Novoselic tells in concrete stories how he learned that (a) community-level politics are important to all of us, (b) it is possible for all Americans to do our part in politics and (c) this can be a source of great personal satisfaction and achievement.<br /><br />Novoselic's claim to fame is his music, so in this book he starts with that part of his life. And why not? he's just the latest of many showmen who used their skill & experience to move into American public life, from Ronnie Reagan and Sonny Bono to The Terminator. It's only fair to attract an audience by using what interests them; give them a few Kurt Cobain stories if that's what they want!<br /><br />Novoselic moves from the music to the politics by writing about experiences he has actually had, e.g. a small town meeting discussing whether to host a music concert; a large city debating dancehall regulation. By the time Novoselic gets to his general ideas for improving the mechanics of our political process, he has demonstrated that he's not just makin' it up; he's actually walked the talk, and is reporting what he's learned.<br /><br />Novoselic's words are not complex and erudite; some might think that he writes too simply or plainly. That's not a fault, it's an asset for people who want a quick read. You can zip through this in an hour, and then pass it on to a friend.<br /><br />The most important asset of the book is the political neutrality of the author's call for civic involvement. Novoselic is clearly a populist and proud of it, but he is calling for all Americans to get into the game, not just those who agree with him. The prescriptions he gives for political action work as well for Red Staters as for Blue Staters. We will not all agree with the author's particular political goals, but we all will benefit from reading what he thinks we should do to improve our political process.<br /><br />We can't all be rockstars. But, as this book points out, we can ALL serve our community and our country in local politics.<br /><br />Or ... we can sit on the couch, watch MTV, and fade away.<br /><br />Your call, dude!for Red Staters as for Blue Staters. We will not all agree with the author's particular political goals, but we all will benefit from reading what he thinks we should do to improve our political process.    We can't all be rockstars.

And indeed, religion and rationality need not be foes, as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Stephen Jay Gould. Reduces our choices to \\"religion or madness\\" is just silly.<br /><br />Schaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality, but authoritarianism with a clerical face. His fans won't like that characterization, but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what's in the book; if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion, this book's skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start.	2005-01-16

This can lead to problems in the later volumes as he runs out of superlatives ... but have no fear! In \\"Valeron\\" Smith tries adding the FOURTH dimension to play in  (which makes his one-dimension characters two-dimensional, almost.) It ends up being a lot of fun.<br /><br />Don't read this expecting anything as deep as, say, \\"Star Wars\\" &lt;g> but do have a good time!<br /><br />(But I STRONGLY suggest reading the other books in the series first, starting with \\"The Skylark of Space\\" because the background will help.)	2003-06-22

Other reviews have gone into more detail on what this book is about, but for me, the key point is this: too many kids' books are uninteresting to adults, and vice versa, but this is one that you will enjoy reading to your child or having your child read to you!	2003-06-04
US	50883429	R27XCR4UTB8MWD	B00005VERT	325409950	Anthem	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Ayn Rand for the Complete Idiot	Anthem compactly expresses Ayn Rand's plusses & minusses. If you like her philosophy & style, you'll like this book; if you don't, you won't. Read this book before you try \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or \\"The Fountainhead\\", so you know whether or not to invest your time.<br /><br />As for the book itself: at the time, it may or may not have been revolutionary, but today it is a bit of a snore. Like Edward Bellamy's utopian \\"Looking Backward\\" and Sir Thomas Moore's original \\"Utopia,\\" this book has been surpassed by works of greater plot, characterization and (... unless you're an Objectivist ...) thoughtfulness, such as \\"1984\\" and of course the great \\"Minority Report\\" (...both the book & the movie... ).<br /><br />The weakness (or strength) of Rand's philosophy is most glaringly evident in the end of \\"Anthem\\", when the protagonist throws off the shackles of collectivism (yay!) and moves into a house built by another (HUH? what happened to individualism?) It's a characteristic found in her other works, but \\"Anthem\\" gets you there faster & more efficiently.	2003-05-22

It finishes up with an imaginative discursion on the Bombadier Beetle and how it can explain the literal existence of fire-breathing dragons.<br /><br />Wow! Fire-breathing dragons in a science book!
