Jack Newlin comes home to find his wife dead. He immediately thinks his 16-year-old daughter, Paige, committed the act. But did she? I won't give away the whole plot, but in some instances the outcome was not satisfying, two major ones towards the end in particular. There are too many easy outs.<br />The message in this story, to me, was that parents are often too quick to try to shield their children from taking responsibility for their actions. This is a very important message. But we don't really see anyone take responsibility for the killing of Mrs. Newlin. There is no final justice in the story, where we see the perpetrator going down in flames. <br />Scottoline's two most interesting characters are the detective team of Brinkley and Kovish. They have an understanding of each other, fighting and joking like an old married couple. I would enjoy reading more stories centering around these two.<br />'Moment of Truth' is a quick, easy, sometimes humorous &quot;beach book.&quot;	2004-02-16

'Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom' is Cory Doctorow's first science fiction novel. Set around 100 years from now, the main character, Jules, lives in Walt Disney World in Florida. Jules has died a few times and been rebooted from a back-up each time. At Disney World a power play ensues between &quot;ad-hocs&quot; over the control of the Hall of Presidents and the Haunted Mansion. Jules has to deal with this while also dealing with the fact that his inner wiring is failing.<br />Doctorow's writing shows signs of a first-time endeavor. It shows undeveloped characters, glaring editorial mistakes, and somewhat adolescent viewpoints. It also shows tiny bits of brilliance. I really enjoyed the premise of Whuffie, the barometer of a person's respectability, which one can use, in a sense, the same way one uses money today; the more Whuffie you have, the better position in life, the nicer living arrangements, etc. For me the ending was unsatisfying. Overall, this book is 3.5 stars.	2004-02-11

Jeeves is Bertram (Bertie) Wooster's manservant in jolly old England. Jeeves is always there to get poor Bertie out of his farcical jams. This book was first published in 1925, but the comedy plays out just as well today. I especially love the variety of turns of phrases that pop up on every page. (Imagine being described by Bertie as: &quot;As vague and woollen-headed a blighter as ever bit a sandwich.&quot;!) Each of the ten short chapters is another adventure, with the last adventure being told from Jeeve's own point of view. I highly recommend this book, and I can't wait to read the others in the series!	2004-02-08

Bernard Goldberg worked for CBS network news for 28 years, sometimes on the same news programs as Dan Rather. On February 13, 1996, he wrote an op-ed piece, published in the Wall Street Journal, which pointed out in simple language that there was a bias in the network news business that he had come to be aware of firsthand. This was essentially the first day of the rest of Bernard Goldberg's life. His coworkers shunned him for letting out such a secret. Now, Goldberg expands on his theme with &quot;Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News.&quot; In his Introduction, Goldberg explains that he is neither traitor nor enemy. The enemy is 'on the other side of the camera.'  His point is that even though there is a distinct liberal bias to their news reporting, either the networks are completely oblivious to it, in a state of denial, or just plain arrogant. Unfortunately, even the best reporters have to, in turn, report to their bosses, and in the world of network news there are many unwritten rules that dictate what a reporter can and can't say. Having stopped digesting news from major sources in 1994 myself, for some of these same reasons, I applaud Goldberg's work. We should all think about WHO is telling us something before considering WHAT it is they are saying. We should be aware of what words they ARE saying and which they are NOT saying.<br />Titles such as &quot;I Thought Our Job Was to Tell the Truth,&quot; and &quot;How Bill Clinton Cured Homelessness&quot; head the 15 unique chapters. There are chapters devoted to the liberal slant on such issues as homelessness, AIDS, gender, race, working moms, and terrorism. Appendix A is the Wall Street Journal op-ed piece written by Goldberg that started it all, but most of it was quoted in the general text anyway.<br />Although 'Bias' starts out somewhat whiny, the book soon gets into the meat and potatoes of liberal bias on the big TV networks in a way that is both familiar and humorous. There are so many examples of bias here that you can't read this book without at least saying Goldberg raises a good question. How do they get away with this? (Read Chapter 10 to find out.) He cites several media studies over the past 20 years, and quotes from numerous printed articles. If you weren't aware of this problem before, you will be convinced after reading 'Bias.' He puts forward a very complete argument.<br />There is a lack of footnotes, which would make Goldberg's information more easily crosschecked, and an index would have been helpful. Do students of media have 'Bias' on their required reading list? They ought to! I liked that the chapters were on individual subjects, yet all of them tied together on the basic theme. This is informative reading!	2003-11-30

John Dunning has written several fiction books, and also a couple of non-fiction books about old-time radio. He at one time was in the bookstore business, which gives him a knowledgeable insight into the world of 'Booked to Die', a story set in the world of secondhand book dealers and a book that has won the Nero Wolfe award. The 2001 paperback edition includes an update written by Dunning, which tells us what has happened since the original release of this book in 1992. Anyone who haunts used book stores and/or likes old-fashioned detective stories will love this book.<br />In 'Booked to Die' we find Cliff Janeway, a member of the Denver police homicide squad and a book collector, wanting nothing else but to take down his nemesis, Jackie Newton. Somebody kills Bobby the bookscout and Cliff is sure it was Jackie. He won't stop until he has pinned the murder on him. Other murders occur, Cliff thinks he has fallen in love (again), and ultimately the story is neatly tied up. This book is a hard-boiled detective story. It's simple, fast reading. I enjoyed following Cliff on his investigations, both lawful and unlawful. He's a great tough-guy.<br />My only complaint is that two of the four main female characters are just awful: Barbara Crowell, Jackie's current interest, says insipid things like, 'God, I hate having you hate me', and Rita McKinley, who everyone calls 'the ice lady', somehow throws all her stoicism out the window and hops into bed with Cliff. Maybe a tough-guy detective needs to bounce off characters like this, but it doesn't play well these days. On the other hand, maybe the fact that I wince is because there are, unfortunately, people out there like Barbara. I highly recommend 'Booked to Die'. Its a great book for sitting by the fire on a rainy day.	2003-11-29

Besides 'Mysterious Island' he also wrote '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea' and 'Around The World in Eighty Days', among others. Here in 'Mysterious Island' he writes a tale of castaways on a Pacific island. I don't know anything about the person he was, but who knows where he got such imagination! It was all so fantastic at the time of his writing and is still fascinating today. 'Mysterious Island' is a great castaway story.<br />My copy of this book was printed in 1962 (before barcodes!). There is no introduction and no pictures to give things away. In this book there are three parts: 'Dropped From The Clouds', 'The Abandoned', and 'The Secret of the Island'. The first part tells of how five prisoners of war, Captain Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert, use a balloon to escape from Richmond, Virgina, during the Civil War. They end up crashing onto an island in the Pacific and proceed to explore it. Strange coincidences start to happen. In the second part they continue to make a home for themselves on the island, and also venture out to another island, where they find a sixth man, Ayrton, whom they bring back to the now-called 'Lincoln Island'. Finally in the third part, there are battles with pirates, and eventually the mystery is solved about the coincidences which have saved them time and time again.<br />Verne's writing not only includes a story, it is full of hard science and facts about nature and animals. The instances where chemical interactions are explained were fascinating. Each of the characters has their own unique approach and offers their specific knowledge: Cyrus is an engineer, Gideon is a reporter, Neb is a servant, Pencroft is a sailor, and Herbert is a budding biologist. This story touches on the fact that man cannot conquer nature. The men transform the island into a paradise for humans, but they do not get to keep it no matter what inventions they come up with. They buildcorrals and storage areas, but storms disintegrate them. You'll have to read the book yourself to find out the final ravage of nature! It might be hard to accept for some people, but nature really does eventually reclaim everything. Nothing is permanent!<br />I was expecting some kind of giant monsters in 'Mysterious Island'. None of that occurred. The way that the mystery was explained was a bit out of left field, and I felt the story dwelled too much on it. Science fiction fans should appreciate this early classic, as I do. The story captivated me, and the hard science was interesting.	2003-11-27

'If Chins Could Kill' is the biography of Bruce Campbell, star of the 'Evil Dead' movie series, TV's 'Brisco County Jr.,' and more. He has a cult following owing to his wise-cracking everyman hero persona. Barry Neville, Campbell's editor, writes the humorous foreword. In the introduction, Bruce dedicates the book to &quot;the players on the second string, the &quot;B&quot; people,&quot; of which he includes himself as a member. The 2002 paperback edition also includes a 39-page addendum: 'Chins Across America, The Tour,' in which Campbell discusses his book tour in 2001 for the hardcover edition. <br />This is the story of Campbell's career and the people behind the scenes with whom he worked. He feels it is very important to recognize the contributions of all the employees who handle the various duties required in making a movie or television series. It is obvious that Bruce wrote this book with his fans in mind, because there are stories involving most of his projects. Campbell writes in a conversational way. Included are many discussions between himself and his buddies, reminiscing about their adventures from Michigan to Tennesee, from Hollywood to New Zealand. Through most of the book he talks about his friends he grew up with and made the first 'Evil Dead' with, including Sam Raimi, who went on to produce and/or direct such mega-hits as 'Spiderman.' Throughout the book, Campbell's humor is apparent. There are photos on nearly every page that tie into the text.  I loved the humorous captions!<br />All Bruce Campbell fans will find something to like in this book. My personal favorite is 'Brisco County Jr.,' but I found this section of the book rather short. Probably because it is my favorite I just wanted it to go on and on.<br />There are several typos in this book (Mr. Neville, Bruce deserves better!). I believe the addendum is a necessity, as it gives his observations on interacting with his fans, and an update on 'where are they now' for the buddies he talksabout in the main part of the book. <br />I am a Bruce Campbell fan and, of course, my copy of this book has his signature in it advising me to 'shop smart!' If you are also a true fan, you MUST 'shop smart' and purchase this book!	2003-11-08

I can say this - it got me interested in reading Plato.<br />Mostly this story centers on Ravelstein, a political philosopher, and his friend 'Chick', whom he has asked to write his biography. Throughout the book we learn the type of person Ravelstein is, which is not the most likable, and then near the end of the book it switches focus entirely and we are given an account of Chick's near-brush with death. Why? Am I missing something?<br />I found this book to be anticlimactic. One thing that irked me is this: There are people in this world who focus on their identity with one group, be it race, religion, or class, and never leave that fact. It is always in their speech. They keep coming back to it. You can't get them away from it. Such is the case with this book, the fact here being one of Jewishness.<br />There are flashes of great writing in 'Ravelstein', but not enough to overcome the irritations.	2003-10-25

Bill Bryson continually makes me laugh out loud. My neighbors must think I'm loony. 'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' chronicles Bryson's return to the United States after living abroad for twenty years. Each chapter is actually a column he wrote for a publication in Great Britian about his experiences in the good ol' USA since coming back. He writes about things that have changed since he left, things that are the same, things that are in a state of flux... His exasperation at some things, including his own foibles, is hysterical. There are so many extremely funny passages it would be impossible to try to pick out some highlights. Read this book!

Peter Benchley has written a suspenseful story about modern-day pirates. Well, maybe not so modern-day, as the pirates behave in a decidedly archaic manner.

The intelligence! The wit! 'The War Against Cliche' is packed with literary criticism that sparkles on its own as outstanding non-fiction and it is immensely pleasurable to read! This collection of Amis' writing spans 30 years of his work. One can see how the writing has matured along the way, but even in the beginning he was already great. <br />I have not read most of the authors that Amis covers.

I was minorly disappointed in the Hollywood-type ending when Lit is going through the streets of her hometown of Kamensic. Still, if this book were to end up a series, I would definitely read it.

Stephen Ambrose REALLY likes Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson. He positively gushes adoration when speaking of these two figures of American expansionism. Roughly, UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the story of how Jefferson and Lewis put their heads together to form an expedition of men to forge through the wilderness of what is now the northwestern United States in order to try to find an all-water passage to the Pacific ocean, and how the resulting exploration succeeded in some ways, but failed in others. At 480+ pages, the book is just long enough to give you the feel of the whole account, with plenty of excerpts from Lewis' and Jefferson's writings, but left me wanting to read more of the details. Where can I get a copy of Thwaite's edition of the Lewis &amp; Clark journals?  :o)  I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of the United States in the early 1800's.

I had no idea that there was a more deadly sinking than the 'Titanic' until I read this book. The 'Wilhelm Gustloff' quite possibly could have taken 4 times as many lives as the 'Titanic' when it went down in the Baltic Sea. The exact number will never be known. At least 4000 were children. Why haven't we heard about it? The Russians didn't want to admit that their submarine had sunk a refugee ship (although it was still painted like a military ship). The Germans didn't want to admit the loss because Hitler wanted to keep what was left of the dwindling German spirit at the closing of World War II.<br /> I learned so much from this book.

In a brief but classic book, you will experience the incredible power of a typhoon while on a steamer as if you were there.  Especially real is the scene in the chart room after the initial damage.  It is very dark, and Captain MacWhirr lights matches to see his surroundings.  Conrad's concise descriptions make you feel even the flame of the match as it burns down.  If only this book were longer! I would have loved to know more about Captain MacWhirr's adventures.  I HIGHLY recommend this book, as well as Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;	2003-01-27

The letter written by Groucho Marx is great, you can hear his voice in it. About two-thirds of the way through I got tired of wading through the muck to get to laugh-producing material, and gave up.  I understand that this is not a joke book, but I just thought it would be funnier.	2002-11-06

It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe. It brings tears to me each time I read it, because if your mind is open, you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading. I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do.<br />I also recommend listening to Richard Harris' reading of this book, though it may be out of print these days.	2002-11-06

An engaging story of young &quot;Billy Bathgate,&quot; who is enamored with the local Bronx gangsters in the 1930's.  Here are his adventures and sometimes his doubts in trying to become a part of the team.   E. L. Doctorow is a master at descriptions of people and locations.  They leave you almost able to smell the surroundings!  The ending was not predictable - you don't know if Billy will or won't end up a gangster himself.  I recommend that you read the book and see for yourself!	2002-10-13

There are so many voices in this book, I still don't know how many characters there are.  Two married rabbis, a Christian priest, somebody's father, a bird-watcher, a writer, a Nazi-hunter...  And most of them speak separately.  Don't get me wrong, there are some golden nuggets of wisdom and insight into the Western world's views of the beginning of the universe, and God, or whatever you want to call that force, or non-force.  This is one heck of a book and its very timely right now when so many people are questioning faith.  This book makes you think, and I like that.  But what's with the birds?...	2002-09-18

If you're looking for happy endings, don't look here. Tragedy, suicide, and deceivement abound in these short stories. (My 1965 hard-cover copy also includes A FEW CRUSTED CHARACTERS.) But if you appreciate remarkable writing that will take your breath away, this is it! Comparable to Hardy's THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE.	2002-06-09

I've just finished SALMON OF DOUBT, and I have tears in my eyes.  The ending of the book contains a letter written by Richard Dawkins, an author and hero of Mr. Adams', which he wrote upon hearing the news of DNA's death.  Mr. Dawkins couldn't believe it had happened.  Who could? It was a very sad time.<br />I can recommend this book if you are a true fan of DNA's, and if you are not already a fan I can recommend this book because it holds many of the pieces of his personality.  It is not a complete book by any means, just a collection of articles, speeches, and unfinished works.  Just a taste of his genius.<br />Douglas Adams was one-of-a-kind and will always be missed.	2002-05-30

Death, Snow, and Mistletoe is great for what it is - a breezy little mystery full of good humor and wacky characters. Tori Miracle is someone with qualities you can relate to.  She is a relocated soul in a Pennsylvania town very different from her previous New York dwelling, still trying to fit in but sometimes wondering if maybe she's landed on another planet!<br />The mystery storyline is very good. I did not know who the killer was until it was revealed, and it made sense.<br />If you want to read something fun I recommend this book.	2002-05-05

I don't favor short stories, but this collection sounded like something I might get into.  Well, I did enjoy the stories. My favorite would have to be &quot;Unready To Wear&quot;. The thought of being able to leave your body and enter dead bodies to use whenever the need arose (say, if you might want to be in a parade), sounds like a pretty good way to extend your life some. Also, I've discovered that since I began the book, I've been thinking in a more abstract way. This is a good thing. A freeing feeling. <br />Kurt Vonnegut wrote in a way that makes you think of possibilities. I appreciate that.	2002-05-02

Ms. Carson draws our attention to the effects of pesticides on all tiers of life-forms. It is the book that made the American people aware of what our Department of Agriculture and the Department of Forestry were doing to destroy life as we know it in this country. Carson writes in an easy-to-understand language that readers at the high-school level will get, and I urge ALL high-school students to read this! &quot;Silent Spring&quot; will have you running for the Organically Grown food section of your grocery store the next time you shop!	2002-04-19

I was interested because of the computer angle. I REALLY enjoyed this! Lots of characters and sub-stories, although most of the characters are not delved into very deeply. That was O.K. with me because I was looking for action, not emotions. This book has LOTS of action! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the schmaltzy anti-feminist ending. Other than that, I would HIGHLY recommend it!	2001-08-20

The Mayor of Casterbridge faces secrets told and untold, misunderstandings, betrayals, loves won and lost... a bona fide soap opera set in a faraway time! Yes, some of the coincidences are a little too convenient, but they kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning! And in the end I cried. This book's characters help us to consider the effects on others of the way we live our own lives. We are truly sorry for the way the Mayor lived his.	2001-04-03

Maybe a smile occasionally, but no laughs certainly. I kept wondering, what on earth is this book about?? When I was nearing the finish (a mighty 600 pages), I rushed to see what the main point was, but as I half-heartedly predicted, there was no answer. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY enjoyed this story! I was frequently flabbergasted by the strange, surreal, quirky happenings! There seemed to be meanings in everything, but not without taking some time to think about it, for the meanings weren't thrown in your face. So much went on that I feel as though I've read five books! I CAN say that this book is the life story of a man named Herbert Badgery. You will not soon forget this name, nor the abundance of bizarre characters in \\"Illywhacker\\".	2001-03-21

The royal family finds itself living among the poor, having to adapt to the equivalent of our Social Security.  Sue Townsend does a marvelous job capturing each of the royals' personalities and how they might (humorously) react to existing in such a manner.  Even the chapter titles are funny. I found myself avoiding reading the titles until I had finished the chapters, then I would go back for a chuckle.  One of the funniest characters is the Royal Dog, Harris.  His attempt to run with the local pack is priceless! Of course I winced when someone asks Diana what she will miss the most of her former lush life and she answers, \\"My Mercedes.\\"  But take into account that this was written well before Diana's tragedy, and the rest of the book is indeed worth reading.	2001-01-27

What a hoot! Bill Bryson's account of his attempt to walk the Appalachian Trail is quite endearing to me, a 41-year-old out-of-shape wishful hiker. You will laugh out loud at some parts. Bryson has an amusing take on the people he meets along the way, and his sometime sidekick Katz. I appreciated his descriptions of the wonders of the Eastern woods which I will never see, because Bryson has convinced me that the Appalachian Trail is beyond my abilities, although it will not stop me from attempting the trails in my own home state of California. I came across an advance reading copy of the book, so I don't know how it compares to the end product, but the situation near the closing of the book nearly had me in tears over concern for Katz. This is a wonderful, funny, informative book. Please read this book!	2000-12-31

One thing that really bothered me: Mr. Secrest references &quot;Black Bart&quot; nine times, in sentences such as &quot;but he was no... Black Bart&quot;, or someone was rumored to have hung out with Black Bart, but never does he give you the actual story of Black Bart! When many characters are mentioned, its as if you were supposed to already know who they are. For instance: &quot;Badly wounded in the aborted raid, Emmett admitted that his brothers had done the Alila job.&quot; Who is Emmett?? This is the first time he is mentioned, and it took me a minute to figure out that he must be one of the Dalton gang. That aside, this WAS an enjoyable book to read, and I will keep it in my library for future reference.	2000-11-28

I suppose those people who were &quot;of the age&quot; when this book originally came out in 1967 might relate to it. For me, I was offended by the use of phrases such as &quot;my woman&quot;, when referring to the mother of his child. The book left me with the impression that this was a man who thought others should do for him, that he wouldn't help with anything unless asked. Very &quot;me, me, me&quot; - a sure sign of a self-involved sixties child.   The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster, originally published in 1968, is a book of poetry which is better than Trout Fishing, although still dated. There were several poems that were quite enjoyable.   The best of the three books contained in this volume is In Watermelon Sugar, originally written in 1964. It has extremely brief chapters, but at least it has a continuous, occasionally surreal story that you can follow. I liked his way of naming things, and I'd like to explore Bolinas, California, where this book was started, just to see what his inspiration was.	2000-11-17
