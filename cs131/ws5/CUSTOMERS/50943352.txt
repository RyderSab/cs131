I do not know why I decided to start here, but I am glad I did.  King first presents the reader with a brief account of his journey through ecoming a writer.  His witty sense of humor about his own beginnings is enjoyable.  He emphasizes that even the best of writers have gotten rejection letters, including himself.  This first part lets you take a glimpse into what made King the writer he is today(which is very interesting!).  King then concludes with a section on writing.  He does not give a magical formula for becoming a writer, but instead gives basic advice.  Read and write alot is what I got from it (very basic).  Overall, I really enjoyed reading this first piece of writing I have read by King, and by the way...I have already bought The Shining for my next read!	2001-01-01

I must say that I liked this one even better than the first, and I hope that the  series conitnues in this path.  There are more moments of magic, mystery,  and excitement to be found once again.  It is nice to open up the book and  see that you are returning to Harrys life that you came to know so well in  the first.  I like the further development of the beloved characters, and  there is never a dull minute while reading this second book.  I highly  reccomend this book if you fell in love with the first one!  Great read for  all ages.	2000-08-23

As a teenager myself, I feel like Anne is writing my own thoughts  on the pages before me and I realized that this hardship of the Holocaust  she faced made her wise beyond her years.  What a strong and optomistic  girl in the face of such adversity!  I wish I could have the chance to  speak to Anne Frank and tell her that she has written a true statement of  human nature so wonderfully.  I admire her so much for her abilties to  write freely and honestly about issues facing all human kind and especially  in the hearts of teenagers.  I am glad that I came upon reading this small  treasure that was written in a time of war, and am able to hear her voice  so loudly now in the present many years later.  I would reccomend this book  to all who want to see and hear what it was and is like to be a teenager  faced with such a terrible hardship.  There is much to learn from Anne  Frank, young and old.	2000-08-23

Through  presenting 4 types of extraordinary minds : Master, Maker, Introspector,  and Influencer, and then providing an example for each (Mozart, Freud,  Woolf, and Gandhi respectively) insight is gained. It is a quick, but  knowledgable read, and I reccomend it for those interested in seeing what  makes a mind higher than the average individual.   Overall, intriguing in  the fact that Gardner is able to pick out traits and then term them on the  path to extraoridinariness.	2000-08-23

I am hopelessy enthralled by the ways of Anne!  The only sadness to remark about it the fact that she is growing up!  I  feel like Marilla at times because she feels a part of her not wanting Anne  to let go of her girlsih spirit.  However, I know that Anne will never  loose her imaginative and creative ways, for she would cease to be Anne.  I  liked this second novel in the series once again because it continues the  story of a girl who is young and adventruos and shares her wonderful  stories with you.  Much lies in store for those who loved the first, and I  will not spoil the new attitudes Anne has come to hold, but you will  probably be eager to read the third after finsihing the second!	2000-08-23

I am eager to learn more about the subject after  reading these essays.  It was also interesting to see the routes that these  philosphers took before reaching this subject.  Many were changing their  majors of physics to philosphy at the last minute or finding that thier  previous interests of arts or literature just did not compare with the  wonders of philosophy.  I think I would have gained more from this book if  I possibly had expereince and knowledge of philosphy, but maybe it worked  just as well to get me interested in the subject!  I recommend this book if  you have studied philosphy before and liked it, or are just interested in  the subject or philosphers in general.	2000-07-20

His  quest is to discover the nine insights of a rumored artifact called the  Manuscript.

However, I found the book lengthy, and possibly would have liked to read a more abridged version.  I realize that Gardner must have sufficient support  for his theory, but it did get a little long at times.  Despite this, the  book was a well-detailed analysis of the wider range of human intelligences  and I believe that this theory will prove to be important in the future of  education.	2000-07-07

I recieved this book from a special teacher as I graduated from high school.  I had never read it, so I eagerly opened the cover to see what lied inside.  I found it such an excellent and moving book about life that  I thought Dr. Seuss wrote it specifically for me.  The truth about life is  there are always obstacles to overcome, but still &quot;you will move  mountains.&quot;  His lively and comical words are just as indispensable  as his wonderfully colored and creative illustrations.  A truly magnificent  book because it is about something we all have to go through:life.  A great  gift for people beginning new phases in thier life or a rewarding read just  for yourself.  Remember &quot;Life is a Great Balancing Act&quot; and you  can succeed even if you fall into the Slump for awhile or visit the Waiting  Place for quite some time.

I found Tom Stoppards'play to be a magnificent combination of wit, humor,  and creativity.  Stoppard takes you backstage to Rosencrantz and  Guildenstern are waiting to play their parts in the Hamlet production that  is going on onstage. Their utter confusion about making decisions and  frequent mentions of death make fun of thier basically inconsequntial parts  in Shakespeares' Hamlet.  Its length was very short, but there were always  plenty of interesting allusions and thought-provoking lines.  Overall,  Stoppards' play was a witty twist on the orginal Hamlet and I would love to  see the play in action.	2000-06-06

It was definately worth reading.  It had an interesting plot  and you can closely identify with Enders very human feelings.  The basic  plot line is the smartest young children go to a cadet academy that trains  them to save the world.  The book describes Enders story through this  sometimes cruel way of life, and ultimately there is a great end which I  thought was powerful. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in  something suspenseful and satisfying.	2000-06-06

The personalities of T.S. Garp, Roberta Muldoon, Jenny Fields, Mrs. Ralph and of course the Ellen Jamesians all  create a world for the reader full of wit and intrigue.  By the end of the  novel the development of Garps character is so complete you feel as though  you knew him.

In Owen Meany, he does just that.  Though most of the book is seen through the eyes of the  narrator, John Wheelright, Owen Meany dominates the spotlight.  Owen Meany  is a complex character, but his nuances make him incredibly interesting.   John and Owens life are hopelessy intertwined and John comments on his  everlasting friendship with Owen and how he affected all other lives that  he entered into.  Its amazing how closely you can identify with Irving  characters.  His witty sense of humor, eccentric plots, events, and  supporting charcters make A Prayer for Owen Meany a definately worthwhile  read.	2000-06-05

She places particular emphasis on the negative effects of our culture and says that the best  solution would involve the decrease of our girl-poisoning environment. She  comments that girls face pressures to be someone who they are not and this  causes loss of true self that is replaced with a false self.  She boldy  asserts that this is a new &quot;problem with no name&quot; following in  the footsteps of Friedan who coined that phrase in the Feminine Mystique.   Throughout the book she reviews issues such as drugs and alcohol, sex and  violence, media, eating disorders, depression, and the like that all  contribute to the loss of true selves.  For each issue she presents, she  also gives real life examples of girls in her thearapy sessions that have  faced the same problems.  Overall, Pipher does a great job of presenting  these issues to the public, and in doing so the possiblity for help for  adolescent girls is increased.	2000-06-05

I learned that there  has been a massive transition from the past to the present.  Its amazing  that feminine products such as bras and tampons that women now consider  ordinary were in fact only created in the 1920's.  Brumberg comments that  women have made a shift from  internal character to external beauty, and  she wants to initiate a reversal. This was ones of her main points, and  whether or not Victorian women focused on internal chracter, it is  important to realize now how prevalent the image of external beauty has  become and its negative effects.   Throughout the book she provided visual  insight though pictures, and real life perspectives from a variety of  girls' diaries.  Overall, she creates a informative portrait of the body  images that women have had to endure and continue to endure.	2000-06-05

I believe there is nothing wrong with the substance  itself, for I thought that was very intriguing. However, the style in which  it was presented was somewhat boring.  Thats not to say the story of the  Professor and the Madman is boring, but only the presentation was a little  on the dull side.  Therefore, if you wish to learn of the backround of the  OED and the two principal characters behind it, this title is very  informative in that aspect.	1999-12-29

I found The Code Book an extremely interesting and informative read. I think Singh did a phenomenal job at bringing together the numerous length of history and presenting it to the common reader in a easy, readable  fashion.  I am impressed once again at Singhs' ability to create such a  organized and clear work like he accomplished in Fermats' Enigma.  I knew  nothing of cryptography before reading The Code Book, but now I know not  only the history, but many techniques of encoding and decrypting as well.   The figures behind the process were equally fascinating and I found out  about many people that I previously knew nothing about. I found the  explanations behind Mary Queen of Scots, the Enigma, the Navajo code,  Bletchly Park, RSA, and quantum cryptography to be both intriguing and  educational.

I can just imagine the considerable effort that went into the genuis of this book.  Catch-22 is a powerful satire composed of such well-written, unique, and frightening  characters.  It can be so absurd at times, but then you find that you are  chuckling to yourself at others.  Then you realize what you found humorous  and that is kind of scary in itself. Catch-22 is such a challenging and  complex read, it is full of allusions, images, and metaphors.  You also  cannot overlook the very organized way Heller used for the time sequences.  However, all these aspects contribute to show the sheer genuis of the  author and how well he was able to create this work. I am sure Catch-22  will remain prevalent in society for a very long time, and just getting  through the book can become a great reward.

Why? Because you are able to witness how a man suffered from the effects of prejudice and his whole disposition was formed from it.  You see  how a very angry man stays angry at the &quot;white devils&quot; for most  of his life.  However, the unique aspect of Malcolm X is that he changed  his views towards the end with the realization that his religion and own  understanding gave him.  This book serves as a learning experience, for one  learns not only about racism and a mans struggle with it, but how to listen  and read with a open mind. Many people get very offended at what Malcolm  says and I can relate.  However, your purpose as a reader should not be to  judge Malcolm, but just listen to what he has to say, and learn from his  experience. Knowledge, insight, and power of personal change are all gained  from this story. I cannot stress enough the importance of having his  autobiography in your memory. A highly recommended read.	1999-12-04

The three main qualities that most women exhibited were that of  hardworking, smart, and independent individuals. These powerful attributes  seemed to be the recipe for success for those women.  I had already  believed those qualties would lead you far, but now that I have seen a  research project I am all the more convinced.  I recommend this book not  just for women, but men as well, for anyone can learn from its important  message.	1999-11-30

Although some people felt like this installment did not live up to the previous two, I found that this novel was important, as well as exciting,  because the shift of focus is taken off Rand for once, and you actually get  to know characters like Perrin and Mat in more depth.  I believe that  Jordan took a great oppurtunity to expand on these supporting characters  and in doing so, has me eagerly awaiting to read the fourth novel, not only  to see what Rand will do, but everyone else as well.  In my opinion I think  that readers of the Wheel of Time need to lighten up on the criticsm of  individual books. Since this is a long series, it means that Jordan has to  take the time to describe, expand, and involve all principal characters in  order to heighten your own concern for them when the climax occurs.  The  way I think about the Wheel of Time is not an collection of separate books,  but rather one long novel that had to be spilt into individual volumes  because of its  size.  In that way, lengthy descriptive parts might happen  to occur in one book, and in another you may be in suspense the entire  time.  I think Jordan has done a fantastic job with The Dragon Reborn and  the whole series in general.  Many like to compare him to Tolkein, and  others say he doesn't live up to Tolkein.  I think Jordan should be  appreciated for his own style.  Jordan is creating his own world with his  own ideas and he is doing a terrific job.  I reccomend this book and the  others highly.	1999-09-10

However, now I have read about the 350 years of history behind his seemingly simple equation that baffled even the best mathmeticians.  I  really enjoyed this book because not only was it interesting, but I learned  a lot about math itself and the people who studied it.  I would highly  recommend this book.	1999-07-16

She is the most imaginative and lively girl who also spreads goodness and hope to whomever she meets. Anne is hopelessy romantic in her  ideals, and I love how she embellishes on simple things such as when she  changed the name of &quot;Barrys' Pond&quot; into the much more appropriate  &quot;The Lake of Shining Waters.&quot;  Another example is how she insists  that Marilla call her Cordelia Fitzgerald instead of Anne.  Overall, the  story makes me laugh at times, cry at others, but essentially every part of  the engrossing story should capture minds that enjoy the descriptions of an  inviting rolling pasture called Green Gables, the perseverance and laughter  of Anne with an &quot;E&quot;,and appreciate all the love and joy that Anne  gives to the characters in her life as well as the reader.	1999-06-26

(Adventures of a Curious Character)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Fantastic Book	I thought it was a wonderful autobiography because Feynman shared all his comical incidents and how he progressed as a physicist at the same time.  Not only did I laugh out loud, but I know a lot more about physics!   Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about an  incredible personality and the genius of Richard Feynman.	1999-06-04

When I first looked at this book, I thought it was going to be a long, drawn out story about feminists that I really didn't want to go through.  However, I was delightfully surprised when I could not stop reading the  book.  I was unaware of the conditions of the American women during the era  of the 20's through the 60's.  I never knew that most women went back to  the home and dropped their fight for womens rights.  I am so glad I was  able to read this book, not only is it one of the best books I have read,  but also one of the most important, for men and women.  I highly recommend  this book, because it proves that women are equal and that they have every  right to do whatever they choose.	1999-03-27

I have never been in war or close to war, but this book made me feel like I was next to Caputo during the hard times in  Vietnam.  I didn't understand war before reading his book, but now I  definately have a clearer reason of why people result to war and what makes  them so evil when they fight one another.  This is an essential book for  every person because it is real, and it is important in understanding the  mind of a soldier.  I recommend this book very stongly, it happens to be  one of my favorite books.	1999-03-10

I probably would never have picked up the Great Gatsby at my own accord, but thankfully I was required to read it for school.  The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books now.  Its short, but full of substance.  I like  that it moves quickly when reading and how human the characters of Gatsby,  Daisy, and Nick all seem.  The reader can connect with these characters and  I think Fitzgerald did a wonderful job on creating this novel.  It is about  the great American dream, so I like it even better. However, Fitzgerald  does an expected twist at the end which makes the book even more effective.  I really like this book, I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes a  little bit of reality, humor, and a great American story.	1999-03-04

I thought it was going to be another one of those boring books, but I was surprised to find it far from boring.  At first, the characters seem excessively weird and  there doesn't seem to be a point to the story.  However, if you have proir  knowlege to religion, you will probably enjoy this book. Among all the  absurd characters of Haze, Enoch, Hawks, and Mrs. Flood there is a point  that makes their stangeness make sense.  I loved this novel because it was  very different from other books that I have read before.  Not only does it  give you a challenge to discover what all the nonsense means, but it is  hilarious at certain times too. I had to laugh the time that Enoch dressed  up in a gorilla suit, the thought of him makes me laugh over and over.  I  highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in something out of  the ordinary that is full of wit, humor, and radical characters.	1999-03-04

I can't wait until my brother is old enough to read it because I loved it so much.  Lowry creates an really interesting world  that leaves the reader wanting to read more and more.  It doesn't matter  what age you are, 12 or 40, its a great book for all ages.  It definately  deserved the award that it received.	1999-03-04
