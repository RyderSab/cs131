The Mary Celeste was a ship found adrift in the Atlantic in the 1870s, with nobody aboard and no sign of a struggle or bad weather. Since that time the mystery of her crew's fate has puzzled and intrigued writers and historians. Hicks lays out all the known facts of the case, while delving into the personal life of the captain and the details of the lawsuit which followed the incident, when the ship was salvaged. He then takes a few amusing detours, recounting the ship's subsequent ill-fated story, the absurd tales that grew up around it, and more plausible early theories of what had happened. In the end, Hicks lays out what he believes occurred, and his case as presented here is certainly the best explanation to date; I do fancy he's solved it. We close with a brief discussion of the Mary Celeste's wreck, which was found recently by divers off Haiti, and this satisfying, well-rounded true tale is complete.	2005-08-17

It tells the story of a misguided 1887 mission by the famed Henry M. Stanley (who had \\"found\\" David Livingstone a decade earlier) to rescue one Emin Pasha, a curious European figure only vaguely associated with Stanley's Victorian Britain. In clear, succinct fashion we are introduced to the twisted situation that led to the grandiose mission, the mission's hidden motives, and its organization. Then we are off, going up the Congo river, feebly traversing the then-unknown (and hellish) forests of Central Africa, and finally on to the shores of Lake Albert where Emin Pasha is thought to be waiting. From the start, the expedition was a disaster and Stanley a violent bully, but somehow it all carries on to its ambivalent victory and aftermath. Good maps help the reader navigate the trip, and overall it is a breezy, engrossing read, despite the sometimes dark tale it tells. There are many footnoted asides, which one might think would be distracting, but aren't especially. A fine summary of a lesser known African adventure.  <br /> <br />(P.s. One niggling quibble to the author with regard to the \\"rear column\\" episode: Ward is sent back down the river to cable the financiers in London and ask what they should do; we are told he gets a response from London, but are never told what that response actually said.)	2005-08-05

Nothing quite like them has ever come along since. Take the opening of this classic, \\"Green Eggs and Ham.\\" A fellow introduces himself by telling us his name is Sam. Out of the blue, another character inquites whether he likes green eggs and ham. This leap is the purest kind of hard-edged absurdity; nowadays if you tried to sell a children's editor or agent on this kind of thing, they would ask for more context, inquire who these characters are and what is their relationship, and why does this fellow want the other to try this food so much, and why green eggs, and blah blah blah instead of just admiring the fact, as most small kids will, that this thing is beyond zany and funny as hell!!! Sure, it has an ostensible lesson about trying new foods, but it's also such a playful piece of nutcase fun that it will stand forever as a simple rhyming reader classic.	2005-07-15

Devoted Sherlockians will want to own this handsome two-volume set, with its completist tables of the chronologies of Holmes' cases among other treats. Some footnotes are quite helpful, where the shed light on hansom cabs and other conventions of the late 1800s which modern readers might not be familiar with. Others are rather pointless, as when the editor throws in long asides about matters of pure speculation by Holmes nutcases, views apparently compiled from years of reading insular Holmesian journals. While giving endless print space to absurd theories about subtexts and Holmes' secret love life and whatnot, the editor sometimes ignores more obvious questions, such as whether anyone ever thought it plausible that a snake could be trained with milk to obey commands in \\"the Speckled Band,\\" and if this was indeed a common belief at one time, why was it? So, not perfect, but a recommended set all the same.	2005-07-15

It was released in 1983 to make a quick buck by cashing in on a popular trend of the time, the \\"choose your own adventure\\" series of books for kids. This book was not in that more reputable series but is the first in its own short series of knock-offs. What makes them funny is that it is awkward attempt to take the choice book style and throw in Harry Blackstone, then a popular television magician, as one of the characters. This doesn't work for two reasons, one of them being that we occasionally have to pause as Blackstone informs his young friends Alex and Amanda (stock kid protagonists) and the reader how to do some convoluted card trick or other, hardly a good narrative device in an adventure story. The other reason it doesn't work is that, like all good choice books wherein the reader makes decisions to alter the fate of the story, there are both good and bad endings, and many of the bad endings involve untimely death. The book has a heck of a time trying to sell and promote Blackstone while at the same time allowing both him and the kids in his custody to get bumped off in various absurd fictional ways. A mask sent to Blackstone by an African headhunter, when tried on by Alex, turns out to contain poison which kills him. Snort. Another time, the kids are captured by a desert sheik and Amanda is forced to spend the rest of her days amusing his children (and hers through concubinage?? They don't say but one wonders) using magic tricks she had been taught by Blackstone. I nearly spit out my tea when I read that one. The writing is, need I say, poor, but I give this one an extra star for the humor value and the period piece it is. This kind of manufactured crap will always be cranked out, and it all becomes funny as heck years later; this one I suspect was funny the day it arrived.	2005-07-08

They just slapped that title on here because Benchley wrote \\"Jaws\\" and they wanted to cash in on it. Second of all, what the creature actually is is so completely ridiculous that it loses the power to frighten the reader. If you need a cheap summer thriller to burn through in a day or two, there are probably others out there that have at least a shred of credibility to make it interesting.

The jacket flap assured me that this was a story about a fellow who moves into a mysterious house full of dragon figurines that come to life. Great, I thought, should be fun. But inside I found a long, slow, tedious grind of a read about a geeky british room renter, a put-upon landlady, a whiny little girl obsessed with squirrels, and a nasty neighbor. Much more than half the book goes by before there are any dragons worth mentioning; they certainly take their sweet time coming to life. Instead we mostly get endless silly exploits about trying to rescue a squirrel with one eye from being trapped by a suburban neighbor. I'm still not sure why the reader is supposed to care. Heck with the squirrels, let's have the dragons. The writing seems flat and contrived, and the whole thing lacked much magic or fun until waaaay towards the end.	2005-06-29

Rey (of Curious George fame)was out of print and now it's back. As ever, Rey's drawings are expressive and fun. However, the story itself is a little problematic; Elizabite is a carnivorous plant who keeps eating things she shouldn't and growing, which sounds funny but is actually kinda weird and frightening, especially when she tries to eat a scientist towards the end. Small kids who aren't put off by this kind of thing may enjoy it anyway, or slightly older kids, maybe. Like \\"Cecily G and the 9 Monkeys\\" which features a giraffe removing its own skin, there is something a little unintentionally disturbing about Rey's more obscure, offbeat efforts. Stick to the CG books and to the recently rediscovered \\"Whiteblack the Penguin.\\"	2005-05-17

The author goes on an endless series of camping trips(often with companions who range from greenhorns to backwoods experts) to find Anasazi ruins in the southwest that most of us will never see, nor according to the author should we ever see them, because too many people would destroy them, but this author gets his thrills going to see them anyway. Along the way he discusses this and other controversies surrounding the famed old ones of the Four Corners region, stories of other explorers who came before, and the occasional eerie thrill of discovery. A helpful appendix explains the different periods archaeologists use to discuss Anasazi history (\\"Basketmaker I\\", \\"Pueblo II,\\" etc.) but there is precious little Anasazi history or achaeology per se in this book, which is a more personal take on the region. We are left with the same appreciation and fascination for the Anasazi which led us to pick up the book in the first place, and some understanding of the problems of this field of inquiry, but not much more understanding of the Anasazi themselves; who they were, where they came from, how they lived, what they believed, etc. Admittedly much of this information is murky and unknown, but, well, it still is after reading this.	2005-04-19
US	52769408	RI6JSFZ7UP2TO	1932425136	705391757	MVP*: Magellan Voyage Project	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Decent	This is an amusing bit of unlikely fluff for kids in maybe 4th or 5th grade. Adam is a lonely computer geek who immediately finds out he has been chosen by a mysterious sultan of some sort to travel around the world in forty days (planes aren't allowed.) Off he goes, but it soon turns out that he is in competition with other kids his age who are doing the same thing in a high stakes game, not to mention obstructionist spies and dart-shooting fiends. Independent-minded Adam is soon at odds with both his protectors and his persuers, and it's hard to know who to trust as he buses, trains, and boats it around the world. This fast-paced narrative, filled with many plot devices and countries to keep track of, is necessarily cursory as far as the places the kid goes, the people he meets, and how he feels. But it's an engaging idea for an ephemeral (soon-to-be-dated) fantasy all the same, and will probably fill a few afternoons for some young fans who will be rewarded for their trouble with high adventure and occasional witticisms.	2005-04-01

This book is highly readable for a general audience; indeed, it pulls the reader along quite well, while vividly describing the personalities involved, the life of the average crusader, the magnificent city and court of Constantinople, and other lively evocations. Where there is discrepancy in the historical sources, Phillips gives us both sides and then weighs in with his own considered opinion. A tour de force of history writing.	2005-03-01

The Berenstains should be remembered for their beginning reader books of the sixties and early seventies. Back then, the drawing style was more free, the stories were simple but clever, and the bears were a memorably comic tour de force. (In latter years they became cranked-out and preachy, and dealt with all sorts of issues in longer picture books and novels. Bah.) What child has ever completely forgotten the impages of their early adventures? In this, their first book, we meet Papa Bear, the bluff but incompetent teacher, and his son, the woshipful pupil who is actually smarter than the teacher. Off they go with a bucket to get some real honey from bees, eschewing the store next to their house. A series of comic misadventures ensure, climaxing with the bears being chased by a swarm of bees and hiding underwater. They return home to buy honey the easy way, as Mama told them to do in the first place. Funny, concise, and still fun after all these years - such are the early Berenstain Bears.	2005-02-23

Filled with colorful photographs, it describes the author's search for what may be a previously unknown species of bear in the tropics of southeast Asia, and the subsequent DNA tests that shed further light on this mystery. Montgomery weaves travelogue, science, and culture together wonderfully. She does not shy away from issues such as poverty, landmines, and cruel treatment of animals in southeast Asia, but her tone is one of wonder and hope. Above all this book may help inspire young readers to care about wild animals and to inquire what they themselves can do to help the environment. Appendices offer extra facts about many kinds of bears as well as organizations, books, and web sites for further investigation. A magic book about a magical, and previously obscure, creature.	2005-01-05

A car comes driving along with no apparent driver, but it is wrecked when a huge truck comes plowing out of the tunnel. Next a small plane flies by, but it is wrecked when a jumbo jet comes out of the tunnel. And so on..! (Young boys will find the repeated, predictable crashes hugely funny.) All the while the man calmly waits, despite the smash-ups happening in front of him. At last bus 24 arrives and the man boards the bus, and it drives off, without getting smashed by anything.

Supposedly a sequel to \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" this one does not come up to the first book at all. This tends to be the case with many sequels, but this one even goes so far as to tarnish the original it follows, by veering what was a splendid story into a realm so absurd and outlandish that it loses the vital toehold on believable reality that made the first book so endearing, magic and all. The first chapter, entitled \\"Mr. Wonka Goes too far,\\" might be applied to this whole story, in which the author sends the characters (none of whom are as likeable as they were in the first book) into outer space to battle space aliens, and off to the White House to wrangle with the U.S. government, and other nonsense that has nothing to do with the first book and its accessible fun. I prefer to read \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" on its own and not to acknowledge that it even has a sequel. Kids may enjoy some of the silliness here, but few will remember it or treasure it like they will do with some of Dahl's other books.	2004-10-28

This one is basically a hodge-podge coffee table book, combining a few interviews with Beatles-related folks (George Martin, Klaus Voorman, Pete Best, Peter Asher, Donovan, etc.)with some memories of Beatles press officer Tony Barrow and some fawning drivel by one of Paul's modern toadies telling us what he's been up to lately. This book was apparently rushed to market, as it has no central concept, a few typos, and the book actually ends in the middle of a sentence. Most of the \\"unseen\\" photos are boring, blurry shots from 1960s television that we could have done without. If this book has any value, it is from the odd collection of guest interviewees; most of these folks have been heard from in other places before, but still, a decent Beatles anecdote is always worth a glance.	2004-09-22

For this reason, her show and any collection of interviews from it (this one focuses on the artists and entertainers) is likely to contain some fascinating material. The interviewees are great. However, as an interviewer, the much-praised Gross actually leaves much to be desired. She is: 1) Competely obsessed with sex. There has never been a sexual reference, however casual and irrelevant, that she didn't follow up on with gusto. 2) Clueless about when to stop pursuing a certain line of inquiry and go on to the next question. The guest may make some passing joke to wrap up the topic and Gross usually hangs around asking him to explain exactly what it means, thus both defusing any humor in the joke and also missing the point that it's time to keep moving. 3) Gaga over everything HBO has ever done. 4)Tactless. A guest may have just lost his leg to a shark. Terry will ask, \\"So, how did it feel losing your leg to a shark?\\" 5)The reason guests often say \\"nobody has ever asked me that before\\" is because the question isn't terribly insightful nor will it shed much light on the subject.

She also does a fine job of articulating why all of this is bad for children and for society in general, and she backs it all up with evidence from psychological studies.

In this long overdue memoir, Mr. Taylor takes us briskly through the Beatles story firsthand, from Taylor's accompanying Epstein to see the Beatles for the first time at the Cavern, to his final ignominious sacking at the hands of Allen Klein. Anyone who has an interest in picking this book up will probably already have a pretty good understanding of the Beatles' history, so it won't matter that the book is cursory in describing the chronological details of that story. Instead, this book is best read for its many anecdotes, which give us insight into the personalities involved, especially Brian, John, and Paul. Taylor himself comes off as a likeable, loyal fellow and while he is honest, he does not dish nasty dirt the way Peter Brown did in his book &quot;The Love You Make.&quot; Taylor also takes time to clear up certain myths, among them the idea that there ever was a &quot;Raymond Jones&quot; who came looking for the Beatles' German single &quot;My Bonnie&quot; at Brian Epstein's shop. (Taylor made the name up when he placed the order himself.)Taylor also cannot hide his disappointment with the Beatles, whom he served so loyally, when they did nothing to prevent his firing in the end. (Indeed, they don't even mention Taylor in &quot;the Beatles Anthology,&quot; though they do reprint the famous photo ad he appeared in for Apple records.)<br />So, while this book is rather a jumpy hodge-podge of anecdotes, it will give you a new admiration for Brian Epstein, an appreciation of the mirthful madness of working with the Beatles, and some understanding of why they inspired such loyalty in the first place. Recommended for fans.	2004-04-30

It reads briskly, which makes it highly suitable for a popular audience. Some of the places Cook visited are only touched on briefly, but overall we get a good idea of what life was like onboard ship and what drove Cook to venture &quot;farther than any man.&quot; We see his character develop from shy underling to commanding presence, as he escapes the class politics of England to make the Pacific his personal exploring playground until the tragic downfall of his third voyage. Dugard has obviously visited many of the places that Cook did, but he mercifully confines his narrative to Cook and his time, instead of inserting long, boring personal adventures of the author the way Tony Horwitz did in &quot;Blue Latitudes.&quot; Meanwhile, I think Dugard's own book &quot;Into Africa&quot; about Stanley and Livingstone exceeds his Cook book in depth and detail, but I came to this book knowing little of where Cook went or what he did, and I came away with a serviceable knowledge and an appreciation of the man's accomplishments. (One other thing, there is a nice general map of Cook's voyages but I could have used a little more visual detail or a few other maps with it. I would also like to have seen a portait of Cook.)	2004-04-20

The genre was invented by Edward Packard, who remained its best author, offering a logical consistency and imagination that was never equalled by other authors of the series such as R.A. Montogomery. \\"Ghost Hunter\\" finds Packard in his usual fine form. This one is nominally a sequel to \\"Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey\\" (which was #9 in the series, and probably the best of them all), but one need not have read Thrombey to enjoy this or any other book in the series. The protagonist, you (the reader), decides to become a ghost hunter, and has many adventures involving spooky mansions, missing diamonds, guard dogs, crooks, and yes, ghosts. It's all great fun, and will keep many a kid interested for afternoon or two.	2004-03-11

I always wondered why others in the fine \\"Moomin\\" series (originally from Finland, and translated in England) were available while this one was not; but now it is, and I couldn't be more glad. Fans of Tove Jansson's writing will know that she has a fondness for quirky creatures, seasonal moods, and an almost effortless ability to strike profound chords in the reader's inner world through faint suggestions and an economy of words. All this from a writer who is known as a children's author, but these novels could appeal to anyone in grade four on up to adults, so long as the reader is of a quiet, thoughtful turn of mind. In this particular story, the Moomin family (rounded, fuzzy little \\"trolls\\") is absent from Moominvalley (see the book \\"Moominpappa at Sea\\" to find out where they went). In their absence, an unlikely group of misfits comes looking for them and ends up sharing a month at their house together. All are seeking for something or other, though they do not yet know that the something is within themselves. Moomintroll's practical, taciturn friend Snufkin (well-known from other books) is onhand to help them sort themselves out, and in the end all are transformed by the shared experience. If this sounds like the plot of an inner world rather than an outer one, it is; yet it is amazingly well done through a very down-to-earth, everyday narration, filled with subtle comic touches and good cheer. Jansson's inimitable, cartoony illustrations of her own books add much to the tale while still leaving some to our imaginations. As you may gather, I have a hard time describing this unique book properly; all I can do is to heartily recommend it to any child (or adult) who is a little offbeat and likes some peace and quiet to be alone with their thoughts.	2004-02-04

Nesbit's classic story of about some Edwardian children who find a sand fairy one summer is an unsentimental delight. Each day the odd fairy grants them one magic wish, be it beauty, wealth, great size, etc. which will only last until sunset. Somehow each wish they make turns into a disaster, but through their own cleverness and a bit of luck, the children are able to make each problem work out in the end. Nesbit's writing is particularly full of amusing asides and offbeat humor in this one. Her turns of plot are inventive, and as the plucky children face their outlandish predicaments, it becomes clear that Nesbit has her finger on the pulse of the way real children might think. Her work has held up quite well considering it is over a hundred years old. This novel would be suitable for kids in about fourth or fifth grade.	2004-01-16
US	52769408	R19OWYDCKNHG7G	0671510126	412606618	The Good Earth (Enriched Classics)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good and solid	&quot;The Good Earth&quot; is justly called a classic. Its straightforward language makes it a breezy read, while its scope remains broad, telling more or less an entire life story. The story is notable for its painstaking, flat realism; its tone remains almost the same whether its protagonist Wang Lung, a peasant farmer, is in good times of prosperity or harsh times of near-starvation, whether he expresses his good side (honesty, hard work, kindness) or his bad side (indulgence, anger, thoughtlessness). For all his faults, we end up caring about the main character. In this the book is a very human, and apparently realistic, view of turn-of-the century China. The cyclical and ever-changing fortunes of its characters mirror the cycles of the land for which the book is named. Somehow the story remains engrossing as it rambles on for page after page about matters both large and small in one man's life. Despite a few inconsistencies (at one point it says &quot;many years later&quot; and proceeds to describe something that is happening in the very same year), loose ends (why did Pear Blossom hate men so?) and frequent stylistic repetitions (&quot;of this and of that,&quot; &quot;well, and...&quot;), the book holds up as sturdily in the long run as the land itself.	2004-01-08

(Sorry, no British studios. Abbey Road, Olympic, and Trident spring to mind - anyone want to write one?) Each chapter picks a particular studio (Sun, Chess, Motown, Western, Columbia, etc.) and gives a brief overview of its history (down to the present day; alas many of the studios no longer exist), its features, and the people who made it special, both artists and engineers. Indeed, the authors have interviewed a number of studio owners and engineers, which adds much to the text. The book certainly succeeds in being evocative - these were the days when echo chambers could be someone's bathroom, when everything was recorded on glorious analog tape, when most basic tracks were done live all in the same room with sonic leakage, and cigarette smoking in the studio was glamorous. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ray Charles, Muddy Waters, Elvis Presley, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, John Coltrane, the Doors, and other greats make walk-on appearances, and there are good photographs of many of them at work. (Actually, I could have used even more photos.) The book also rescues from relative obscurity one Bill Putnam, who apparently designed many of the sweetest-sounding rooms in the country. Often there are anecdotes about the history of studio owners and their labels, which are interesting, though one might hope for even more anecdotes about the artists and recording sessions. I found myself wishing for a little bit more technical information too, about how each room was set up and what specific gear they had, though some of this is mentioned briefly. And, of course, they can't cram every studio in here - for instance, there is no chapter on Muscle Shoals. However, the book ends with a nice discography of tracks to hunt down and listen to, each associated with one of the studios,and all of which I want to listen to after reading about these places' heydays.  I find this book fascinating for what it does tell us, and inspiring in its depiction of an era when artistic talent, engineering skill, and human warmth made sometimes low-tech rooms into hallowed cathedrals of sound. A good gift for anyone interested in recording, or in the 50s-60s period.	2003-12-29

Sure, there is innocent charm aplenty in this tale of three children whose father is mysteriously called away. The family (Roberta, the eldest girl and main character, Peter, and Phyllis) go with their mother to live in the country, and while mother tries to make ends meet by writing stories, the children explore the area, make friends with people at the train station and on the passing train, and involve themselves in a couple of daring rescues. Each chapter is like its own little adventure, but always there lingers the question of where has father gone, and how will the family pull through its crisis. Sunny the author's outlook may be, but it is not sentimental, as evidenced when the children throw a surprise party for Perks the porter and he is angered rather than glad, fearing they do it our of charity. The children fight amongst themselves, and worry, and fret, like real children of that or any era might. Throughout the story, the reader comes to enjoy this country town and its cast of ordinary but amusing characters. The story's ending is actually very moving in its simple way. A classic.	2003-12-29

Unfortunately, it would be a rare child who would possibly be interested in any such thing, and this verbose, detailed picture book is not likely to draw them in. His books are more popular with the New York Times set who thinks children's books ought to be aimed at adults.

Ever since Mark Lewisohn published his momumental session-by-session \\"The Beatles Recording Sessions\\" in 1988, I have been waiting for other important artists to be given the same thorough, studious treatment. It's been a long wait, for while some vaguely similar titles have been published (including one about Jimi Hendrix), few of them could offer access to the same obsessive documentation that Abbey Road studios required of its engineers. Syd Barrett, the offbeat genius and erratic founder of Pink Floyd, also happens to have done most of his work at Abbey Road, and David Parker has been through every corner of the studio files to come up with this impressive offering. In it, we learn the date and content of every professional recording session Syd Barrett (with and without Pink Floyd) is known to have done during his finite career, from the first 1965 demos through the last, unheard, abandoned sessions in 1974. Some of Syd's engineers, friends and managers (Peter Jenner, etc.) contribute memories and comment perceptively on each of the songs and sessions. (Alas, no comments from members of Pink Floyd.)It should be noted that the author did not actually get to listen to many of the tapes; indeed, sometimes tape was recycled at the studios and the originals no longer exist. Nevertheless, the documentation is here. This is a wonderful, respectful reference work for any Syd Barrett fan, and an amusing read for anyone interested in recording sessions in general. Discographies, a compendium of live shows, and other appendices add to the completist fun. Wow, a winner.	2003-11-05

It contains the numerous factual errors and unsupported assumptions that so often plague books written by professional book-writers and journalists who have done some research but are not intimately familiar with the subject matter. We glide through Harrison's complex life at a brisk pace, stopping occasionally to note his generosity or his personal failures and struggles with fame. To its credit, the book is not especially tawdry, and takes some stabs at insight into Harrison's character, though again it would take a deeper Beatles scholar than this to succeed in any such endeavor.	2003-08-29

If so, you must seek it out at your public library. All of Jansson's &quot;Moomin&quot; books are wonderful, and this one is too. Moominpappa, a round little pudgy creature, writes down the memoirs of his youth - how he was born under a lucky star, how he escaped from an orphanage, and how he met his friends and fellow oddball creatures: Hodgkins, a practical, mechanical genius; the Muddler, a worried collector of bric-a-brac; the Joxter, a lazy fellow with a no-nonsense philosophy; the Mymble's daughter, a mischievous but merry girl; and Edward the Booble, a giant something-or-other who keeps popping up when least expected. The cast of curious characters goes on in this delightful tale of a fantastic world that is also gentle and funny in a very offbeat way. Moominpappa's meandering adventures are interrupted now and again as we cut back to the present time, where the next generation listen with rapt attention to the heroic tale of its author. Sweet, subtle fun for kids around grade 4.	2003-07-29

Spike and his owner Shannon spend a day in the city, where Spike is roundly ignored by snooty dogs and cats, steps in gum, gets splashed by passing trucks, and generally gets in a mess. However, the love of his owner recalls Spike to good humor. I found this ending a little contrived and lacking the power that a similar message dealt when delivered in \\"Spike.\\" Structurally, I get the feeling that the book is kind of rambling, and it repeats the gag of Spike being ignored by other creatures unnecessarily. There's not much story here except a dog bumbling around, which is good for some giggles at any rate.	2003-05-09

Dickens' first historical fiction, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is not a big favorite either with Dickens fans or with critics, largely because of its curious lack of the divinely memorable characters for which Dickens is usually known. (There are some good characters, but not the all-star cast we come to expect from the master.) Be this as it may, there's no denying that the buildup and eruption of the Gordon riots in London offer us some of Dickens' most compelling writing. Once the riots finally begin, they sweep us along in a torrent of demonic energy that is suitably appalling to the reader. For this reason, &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; is certainly worth reading. Even &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; does not conjure the same breathless chaos as &quot;Rudge&quot; does. Also, though it is one of Dickens' earlier books, it has much more evidence of structured planning than do more improvised works such as &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop.&quot; Dickens would not truly master the art of creating a well-rounded novel in serial installments until &quot;Dombey and Son,&quot; but he is clearly on the right track here.	2003-04-28

In just a few short pages it manages to draw the reader into an exciting plot about a boy whose uncle sends him to pick up a mysterious package. When the boy returns, his uncle has been kidnapped. Inside the package is a plaster cat (rather like the Maltese Falcon), which is both the cause of the mysterious kidnapping and a clue to its solution. With his friend, the boy visits a sinister collector of these cats in town and find out what is at the bottom of this fishy business. This story is action-packed and full of memorable images; it is also illustrated by Quentin Blake. I remember reading it when I was in third grade, and I just tracked down another copy fifteen years later to enjoy again. It's not great literature but it's good fun.	2003-02-25

(Moomintrolls are not trolls as we commonly think of them, but handsome little round fellows - see the picture on the cover. That's Moomintroll on the left in the brown coat.) At first he feels terribly alone in this strange season, but he soon discovers companions in the form of Too-Ticky, a sensible creature who has taken up residence in the bathing house, and Little My, a devil-may-care little critter known from other Moomin books in the series. Alongside these friends Moomintroll faces the winter, with its freezing cold blasts, sledding on tea trays, equinox bonfires, ice fishing, and blizzards that promise spring. He soon discovers that the winter landscape is full of lonely, oddball (and comical) creatures who are not around at other times of year, and does his best to shelter and entertain them in the Moominhouse. Like all of Jansson's fine Moomin books, this one astounds me with its ability to convey power and subtle emotion with just a few choice words. Her exquisite attention to the aspects of the season, as well as to the sensitive inner worlds of her characters, render this a masterpiece. (Its subtleties, both comic and deeper, might perhaps be appreciated by slightly offbeat children who like a little peace and quiet sometimes to be alone with their thoughts.)	2003-02-19

When Milton and Marvin decide that \\"valentines aren't just for girls, they're for everyone\\" they set about procuring valentines to give to everyone in the neighborhood. Money being short, they make their own cards and slip them under people's doors instead of mailing them. (People are delighted.) When they have some left over, they sell their homemade valentines for 5 cents each, so other people can have the joys of giving. Milton laments that they didn't get any valentines themselves, but that isn't quite true, for with the money they made the boys are able to buy a box of candy to share with one another in friendly fashion. This is a sweet book about random acts of kindness and overall generosity, and the straightforward text and cartoony illustrations keep it from being sappy. A good one.	2003-02-12

Like many western readers, I knew next to nothing of the history of Tibet and central asia before the Chinese takeover. The first few chapters here do a good job of outlining this subject, all the while leading up to the author's central thesis that Tibet has historically been separate from China, both politically and culturally. However, political history is seldom cut and dried, and as we move towards the twentieth century we see how British, Russian, and Chinese imperialist politics combined with divisions and corruptions inside Tibet to seal the fate of this isolated country. It was eye-opening to see Tibet as not merely a hapless victim of a cruel invasion, but also as an active, humanly flawed player in the region's mutable history. The author is a college professor but his writing is easily accessible to a general audience.	2003-02-05

It's good to finally get some information about Paul's Wings years. This is obviously Paul making his own case, though he is certainly honest about matters such as his frustration with the band's ever-changing lineup, as well as his 1980 arrest for pot in Japan. Overall, one cannot help but admire the bravely carefree attitude with which Paul formed this new band and made some spotty but often good music. Above all this book is meant to be a tribute to Linda McCartney, a defense of her role in the band, and an inspirational look at how a family man can combine work and play. Personally I would have liked to see more in-depth interviewing by someone more impartial, as well as interviews with other band members, most especially Denny Laine who stayed with Wings through the entire decade but is given rather short text shrift here. But then, I'm grateful for what we get. As Paul comments, Wings wasn't rocket science, it was just making music, and this is a fun, breezy book about a fun band.	2002-12-30

Old Mr. Putter and his old cat like to sit and watch the snow, but they must act soon if they want to think of something to give their nice neighbor, Mrs. Teaberry, for Christmas. Knowing her unlikely fondness for fruitcake, the intrepid pair decide to bake her one that wouldn't \\"break her toe if she dropped it.\\" After much ado, they finally succeed in their effort, and fall asleep on Christmas morning in Mrs. Teaberry's house, having just delivered the cake. In the end, Mr. Putter goes home with \\"a very nice toaster that sang 'America the Beautiful' when the bread popped up.\\" This gentle, subtle humor runs throughout the book and goes well with the colorful, expressive illustrations. Mr. Putter's persistence in trying to bake a cake is admirable. Furthermore, like many good Christmas books, this one shows the importance of giving. A fine book for kids who are just beginning to read.	2002-11-27

Perhaps this is because of its ingenious plot premise. In this story, the famous deductive detective and his friend Dr. Watson are called upon to investigate at Baskerville Hall, a remote country mansion where the new heir to the property fears for his life. Apparently an old family legend has come true, and a horrible hound who haunts the moors is thought responsible for the deaths of the previous landowners. I know of no more chillingly atmospheric and mysterious setups for a mystery than this one. Unfortunately, large portions of the book feature yawning gaps in which Holmes himself does not appear, and we are forced to subsist on less interesting characters. Still, it *is* a Holmes story (fans of Holmes were delighted when this novel first appeared, since it was the first new Holmes story in some years, the author having previously killed off his famous hero in \\"The Final Problem\\") and the mystery is a good one, featuring red herrings, suspicious goings-on, and clever sleuthing by the great detective. The climax of the tale, when it finally comes, is as exciting as any Conan Doyle ever wrote. A must for mystery fans.	2002-11-21

(I think his best may have \\"Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?\\") It begins with the protagonist - you - returning to the Cave of Time (book #1 in the series) and ending up in medieval England, where the ruthless King has offered a fortune to anyone who can solve the riddle that will lead to a Forbidden Castle of great power. The riddle is a clever one with a logical explanation, and the quest for the castle proves a dangerous and ultimately rewarding one, though not in the way one might expect. Young readers (say, 3rd-5th grade) will want to read the book many times to discover all of the endings, and enjoy the historical fiction in which sensible decisions really do take you somewhere. The book features appealing illustrations by Paul Granger.	2002-11-07

While Mama decorates, a little girl (I think it's a girl) asks questions about the irrational worries she has - what if snow covers the door? What if the reindeer's antler gets stucik in the branches of the tree over my window? Etc. Mama responds with practical solutions to each of these fears, and eases the child's mind. This is an engaging idea for a picture book, as many children are apt to wonder odd things like this, and will appreciate the tone of comfort. Those who know better will find it all funny. The book is marred only by the completely unnecessary ending, where the mother says \\"Merry Christmas, my stinky face\\" to the child. Readers are apt to wonder why the mother uses this supposed term of affection, as it has never been introduced before - for some reason it is also used as the title of the book. But with some explanation, most kids will enjoy the rest of the story.	2002-10-29

In well-turned verse couplets, it explains how the bunny family (Mom, Dad, three kids and baby) set up house in a bungalow and \\"made it all their own\\" by decorating it (including a carrot weathervane) and living in it (baths, picnics, playing, bedtime, etc.) All of this is skillfully illustrated with simple strokes and appropriate washes of color.

However, the book is presented to us in the form of a novel, and thus, alas, asks to be reviewed on the grounds of one. As a novel, this is a stinker: an implausible adventure story about some guy flying all over the jungle on a whim, trying to find out various &quot;insights&quot; and illustrate them with his adventures. As I say, the insights themselves are interesting and may prove valuable to readers, but the story they get crammed into is an albatross.	2002-08-20

It cannot work very well as a mystery story, since most of us already know the secret of the book, that one character transforms bodily into the other. (Nor is Mr. Hyde a straightforward horror monster - he is capable of vaguely civil conversation.) This short tale unfolds in a somewhat disjointed series of vignettes, as a certain lawyer grasps various strands of the mystery of Dr. Jekyll through chance encounters and legal documents. For all these possible flaws, the concept of the book goes straight to the reader's imagination and also to the conscience. Hyde is the evil within all people, and who among us cannot identify on some level with him, and fear him all the more? Who among us has not in some fashion struggled for our better natures as Jekyll has? The concept is brilliant, and timeless. For this reason, the book remains as absorbing as ever. (Incidentally, the introduction to the \\"mass market paperback\\" edition by Vladimir Nabokov consists largely of a summary of the book's plot, and is thus of limited value.)	2002-07-31
US	52769408	RRB7E6N4873NC	0374324522	303089041	The Forest	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A gentle treasure	There are really very few picture books each year that are truly wonderful, but I think this is one of them. \\"The Forest\\" is in many ways a subtle and quiet book, but its simple plot is one that kids can easily relate to. Told in a first-person narrative, the book tells of a mouse living in a little town who is afraid of the forest. One day he decides to face his fear, and so leaving the cosy home and town, he ventures towards the looming woods. When at last he enters them, he is scared stiff but soon realizes that he really had little to fear except fear itself. The message is thus a very positive one about facing our imaginary fears. Adults as well as children will appreciate the beautiful, detailed, moody paintings that illustrate the story; they show just enough menace to make mouse's fears seem real, but not so much that they are actually scary. The pacing of the story is excellent. Simply put, this book does everything it sets out to do very well.	2002-07-29

The plot (told in short, readable chapters) involves some twins who are at a crummy orphanage until they are adopted for the summer by an elderly pair who live a rustic life in the woods. Eventually the two pairs warm each other's hearts, while the orphanage owner plots to steal the old folks' money. My problem with this novel was that it seemed so random at times, going inside the heads of and giving humanity and depth to its villains for no apparent reason, and leaving some important things (like what happens after we find out who the kids'parents are, itself an unlikely twist) unresolved. The inner workings of the characters seem ambivalent at times - is it best for the wife to go off and take a trip by herself or to stay home with her loving husband? I don't know. I don't much care, actually. Nonetheless, this is a pleasant read for those who will root for the kids to find a happy home.	2002-07-05

It can also be read straight through if you prefer, and the story it tells is comical but strangely poignant. A young boy from a large family leaves his happy home in the country in search of donuts, heedless of the classic advice which he keeps hearing from a wandering old lady - \\"Who needs donuts when you've got love?\\" The boy makes his way to the big city, where he falls in with a slightly shady character who gets him all the donuts he could possibly imagine. (The boy proceeds to wheel them about with him in a wagon. This immense pile of donuts is hilarious to behold.) At this juncture the shady guy deserts him at the drop of a hat, and the boy is left alone with his donuts. Gradually he becomes dejected, but then he finds a use for the massive pile when a bull escapes from a china shop and ruptures a vat full of coffee, which begins to flood the basement home of the sleeping old lady whose advice gives the book its title. Thinking quickly, the boy comes up with the perfect rescue, and returns home where he belongs with his loving family. Adults as well as children may enjoy the unusual humor of this charming book, with its genuine moral message about material things.	2002-07-03
US	52769408	R3TNN9SY9OZWBV	006447089X	269868178	Saturnalia	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Atmospheric read	This slim volume is a good historical fiction glimpse for young adults. It tells the story of William, a young Narraganset Indian who was captured in King Philip's war, and now serves a printer in Boston, where he is treated kindly and learns to study books and English ways. By day he is English, and by night William sneaks out and scours the December streets looking for his lost Indian brother. Though the plot focuses on William, the book is full of colorful characters of the Puritan city, some ridiculous, others tragic. What I like most about this book is the cimenatic way in which our focus is led from one character to another, keeping the perspectives fresh and interesting. (For this reason I think the book would make a good film for television.)Fleishman has done a good job of conjuring up the atmosphere of early Boston, and the eerie world of the dark city at night. Because the book is so short, I'm not sure Fleishman does entire justice to the complex themes he has raised - the struggle of the young Indian between two cultures, the struggle within the English colonists between Puritan strictness and the human need to have fun (in ways such as celebrating the ancient Roman holiday for which the book is named), etc. Nor does it entirely resolve the fates of some of the characters, such as the wood carver who seeks to atone for his wartime past. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable, atmospheric, and original read.	2002-06-21

There have been many volumes of bad verse before (though few as thorough), but Nick Page has also generously included a few excerpts from bad playwrights and novelists as well. He also comments amusingly on many of the entries. The bottom line is, there isn't a page in here that won't make you grin or even laugh aloud. I think my favorite discovery herein is a man who tried to write a phrasebook of English for those learning the language, whereas he himself couldn't even speak it! Anyone with an interest in written English will not want to miss the outstandingly bad poetry and prose in this impressive collection. (Those who are fond of bad verse may also want to try to find a used copy of &quot;Pegasus Descending,&quot; an anthology from the early seventies edited by James Camp and others. That volume is notable for its inclusion of clunkers by otherwise great poets such as Emily Dickinson.)	2002-03-15

It should be noted that this book is not an in-depth discussion of how Beatles records were made, but more of an overview of Martin's larger career (yes, he did do many other things besides produce the Beatles!), and a rumination on the astonishing changes in recording technology which have taken place in so short a time over the course of Martin's career. Special chapters discuss such specifics as the acoustics of studios, the changing role of record producers, and methods of writing film scores, all in a clear way that the average reader can understand without being very technical. I was struck by the breadth of Martin's sonic understanding, his appreciation of many kinds of music, and his down-to-earth approach to everything. Along the way we are treated to anecdotes about his personal life, his work with comedians such as Peter Sellers, his financial struggles with EMI and his own company, AIR, etc. The Beatles are mostly discussed in a chapter on &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; though his recent book &quot;The Making of Sgt. Pepper&quot; is an even more illuminating tract on that subject. <BR>&quot;All You Need is Ears&quot; first came out in the late 1970s and may seem a bit dated now, were it not for the fact that Martin predicted most of the technological advances that have happened since, including the rise of digital recording and compact discs.<BR>Fans interested only in the Beatles should also look elsewhere, but anyone interested in a larger view of various aspects of the recording industry will be fascinated.	2002-02-07

Unfortunately, there isn't quite enough known to make a whole book out of, and the author is forced to pad the book with seemingly irrelevant details like the barometric readings of each hour of the day, simply because these facts are available. A little bit of the book necessarily seems like speculation, and reads like fiction - &quot;he wiped his forehead&quot; or some such unknown detail. Where it sticks to first-hand accounts of what happened that day, the book is a welcome triumph and an amusing read for obsessed fans.	2002-01-15

The author is inspiring in his recommendation that you listen carefully to sounds and figure out ways to combine them that are interesting. The book may seem a bit dated now in its understanding of technology, since it came out in the early seventies (I think), but then again all anyone needs to have some fun with this is a tape recorder. I will say that it's interesting to see how out-of-the-loop the author is, from an ivory tower background where he knows about the sonic experiments of Berio but seems utterly ignorant of the amazing accessible advances that were made by rock artists like the Beatles. Still, we all come from where we come from. Anyone with an interest in playing with tape will enjoy this dated but inspiring missive.	2002-01-08

If you are familiar with this artist's unique brand of sophisticatedly absurd stories, illustrated with a distinct, careful pen-and-ink style that is halfway between fine art and cartoon, then you will be intrigued to find out more about the eccentric man who made them. (If you are unfamiliar with his work, I strongly suggest you find a copy of a collection of his called &quot;Amphigorey.&quot;) This book collects the best interviews and magazine pieces about Gorey that appeared from the sixties until his death in the late nineties. Taken together, they give a pretty good idea of what Gorey was like - erudite, obsessive, reclusive, and above all, a man who did his own thing regardless of whether it brought success or not. (In this he is a truly inspirational figure, however odd you may think him. It's not that he was a particularly happy person, but he always allowed himself to be himself.) Gorey speaks of his artistic influences and offers sporadic glimpses into his family life and work habits. Where else will you find this much information about him in one place? This may well be the truest glimpse of the man behind the art that we will ever see.	2001-12-31

I would recommend this book for kids in grades 4-5, as it is not for the fainthearted; many animals die or get eaten in the dark first half of the book, which is realistic but might be unsettling for kids if they are unused to reading about these harsh things. The premise of the story is a very original one. A pair of clockwork mice are joined together as one toy, and when they are used up as toys, they get sent to the dump. So begins an odyssey of adventures and perils. These include: slavery to a rat (who will pursue them for much of the book when they escape), bank robbery, war (among shrews), arty theater (an an audience riot), school (run by a psuedoscholarly muskrat), immersion at the botton of a pond for an entire summer, and getting dropped from a great height by a hawk. Along the way they meet a series of comic characters, which helps lighten the mood despite the harrowing nature of their ordeals. The ending of the book is so very empowering and happy that I did enjoy it. The message here is one of persistence and self-confidence in the face of overwhelming odds. With its quirky but genuine power, this one stands out among children's novels, and would be a good read for adults too.	2001-12-19

However, he sure takes his sweet time to get there. I found it slow going getting through his manneristic writing (especially the endless scene where Mrs. Glass speaks to Zooey in the bathtub and simply won't shut up or leave.) I didn't find any of the dialog believable, and I didn't care very much about the characters either. Young people may enjoy the intellectual exercise of keeping track of the Glass family and their verbose meanderings, but I grew tired of it all. I'm glad I got to the end because the message there is indeed an important one, and helps justify the reading of these stories; they are not great, however. Salinger showed off his writing skills better in some of the Nine Stories.	2001-12-11

In understatedly witty text, it tells the story of Delver mole, a young mole who lives underground and knows nothing of Christmas. One day he hears about it from a mouse, and wonders if this &quot;fat man in a red suit&quot; will bring him his dearest wish - a telescope so that he can see the stars. (Being very nearsighted as most moles are, he has never seen them.) Risking the peril of facing the local owl, Delver and his family build an above-ground chimney and leave a letter for Santa. They then fall asleep waiting on Christmas eve in the open, and are about to be snatched up by the owl when, in a curious and believable way, the owl finds some Christmas spirit and is duly rewarded by Santa, who also brings the telescope for Delever. The illustrations are memorable and the story is a complete charmer. Highly recommened for kids preschool through grade 2.	2001-11-23

The art work is simple, appealing, and very colorful, right down to the endpapers. Best of all, there is a map of bear's house at the end of the book showing all the rooms we have visited.

Its premise is that mice are putting on a play about the first thanksgiving. We watch the show and then cheer at the end. The artwork has a few clever moments in it depicting stage hand mice pushing Plymouth rock props into the scene, etc. The text, however, doesn't flow very well. It is told in terse couplets, as if in verse, yet often the verses fail to rhyme - or if they do, we wait a few pages for the rhyme to come. Thus, any readaloud singsong quality which the text is apparently meant to have (and which is the only thing that might compensate for its abruptness) is foiled. The idea of the play is engaging enough to make this an interesting addition to the sometimes thin genre of Thanksgiving picture books.	2001-11-20

Holly Hobbie's ever-dazzling watercolors are back in force, and she really shines painting snow scenes. As in their first book, Toot the pig is off traveling while his best friend Puddle carries on at home, and the book skillfully cuts back and forth between their comic efforts. This time Toot is visiting an aunt in Scotland, who gives him her &quot;lucky nut&quot; as a keepsake. He sends word to Puddle assuring him that he will indeed be home to Woodcock Pocket for Christmas, whereupon Puddle happily busies himself with holiday decorating and baking. But Toot's plane is delayed by ice, and when he finally lands in Boston the whole city is shut down by snow. He bravely hikes off into the woods, but can only go so far. As he sits down to shiver, he notices the lucky nut and makes a wish upon it that he will make it home somehow. Soon he hears the jingle of bells... well, you can guess what happens! It is cleverly done, and never explicitly stated or known by the pigs who exactly gives Toot a lift in his sleigh. Naturally the pigs are delighted to be reunited at home, whereupon they hang the lucky nut on their tree and they go to bed on Christmas Eve knowing they will wake up together on Christmas. All in all, a satisfying and suitably magical book for kids (say, preschool through 2nd grade) - and for adults who like fine painting, and reunions too!	2001-10-22

She has done a good job of conjuring the excitement and drama of this historical mystery, bolstered by impressive research and a keen perception. However, I must agree with some of the reviewers below that her persistent failure to write in complete sentences makes for choppy reading at times. Perhaps she intended this fragmentary style to heighten the drama - I can think of no other way an editor would allow it. Also, I agree with someone below who said that another map or two would be helpful. She mentions many specific place names, many of which have changed since that time, and it was a little hard to follow the exact whereabouts of certain events, even though I am familiar with the Outer Banks. Be that as it may, the story itself is so compelling that I recommend the book and commend the author for her valuable probing. Above all, Miller makes it clear that there is ample evidence from which we may conclude what really happened to the colonists (and she does a convincing job interpreting every scrap that remains) and that much of it has been suppressed or forgotten for 400 years. Perhaps the Lost Colony is a mystery no more! This fact alone justifies reading this book.	2001-08-08

Fans of Gorey's unique world, with its obscure humor and painstakingly rendered artwork, will enjoy this offering as yet another fine example of the master's hand.

Fans may find this one reminiscent of &quot;The Willowdale Handcar.&quot; Those unfamiliar with Gorey's work should first investigate his fine &quot;Amphigorey&quot; collection to get a sense of the utterly unique niche Mr. Gorey occupies, a mix of fine art, cartooning, illustration, highly subtle literate wit, and a morbid turn.	2001-07-18

In sober tones it presents all the available documentation we have about &quot;The Pushcart War&quot; as if it were an actual event, all the while making fun of big business, corrupt government, and mass media manias. The Pushcart operators are a collection of likeable and eccentric characters. Big truck companies who are blamed for tying up traffic use pushcarts as scapegoats for the problem. One day a truck pushes a florist and his cart into a pickle barrel, as part of a campaign to get the pushcarts off the streets. The pushcarts decide to fight back with various clever strategies, and the &quot;war&quot; that ensues is engaging, memorable, and fun. (The book is not pro-war, however, so don't worry.)

John Collier is perhaps better known for his short stories, but this first novel was an exquisitely funny satire. It tells the story of Emily, a chimpanzee who pines for a certain Englishman, Mr. Fatigay, while he teaches school in Africa. When Fatigay returns to England, he takes the friendly chimp with him as a companion, for he realizes that she is clever... though he has no idea that the silent chimp is able to read and to recite literature in her head, nor that she loves him. Emily is handed over to Mr. Fatigay's human girlfriend in England, who will tolerate no rival of any sort and treats her new servant shabbily. Still, Emily finds time to dress up and sneak out to London and the British Museum Reading room (where she is taken for a fascinating woman of mystery!) among other absurd adventures. Though the book is lighthearted, we do feel for its protagonist and her hidden love. Collier has a keen eye for the petty foibles of humankind, and of course the big joke is that the chimp is more intelligent and sensitive than any human here. The premise is somewhat outrageous, but the good writing allows us to suspend disbelief and go along for a ride filled with subtle giggles and wicked belly laughs.	2001-07-06

In this case, a man's wife suddenly becomes a fox, and we follow the man's doomed efforts to conceal her from dogs and people, to keep her living a human-like existence, and to carry on as best he can. There a moments of odd humor in so strangely premised a tale, but overall it is fairly sad and really touching. A few readers may find the ending unsatisfying, but I think it works well enough,and even suggests a moment from Greek Mythology. This is a short novel that can be read at a sitting or two, and one that may haunt your dreams.	2001-07-03

I would recommend it for kids in third or fourth grade. It tells the story of an odd cafe where, in each chapter, something mysterious happens - such as a famous movie star coming and eating there and then leaving, whereupon everyone remembers that the star in question has been deceased for many years. This is a gentle, charming, subtly magical book.	2001-06-19

I read &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Bleak House&quot; and did not find it boring. I read &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; and did not find it boring. But &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is, well, boring. Here's why: I never gave a damn for this Hemingway hero Robert Jordan. He seems like a pretty aimless tough guy, making love every fifth chapter and cussing around trying to be cool. The ending was entirely unsatisfactory - we end up having gone just about nowhere. Fortunately, Pilar is an interesting character who adds some spice to the proceedings. The only real point to this novel seems to be conveyed by its fine title, a reference to a John Donne poem. Loosely, the poem conveyed the idea that whatever happens to any human being ought perhaps to be the business of all of us. In the case of the novel, Hemingway draws attention to the largely overlooked Spanish Civil War and its suffering. But he does so with the title page alone; the rest of these 400 pages add little to this noble premise. Hemingway needs a better plot to devote his fine style to.	2001-05-07

One goal of any serious eastern meditation practice is to eliminate the false dualities so often present in human perception - including the duality of male/female. It is also a selfleess means to the cessation of suffering as exemplified by desires and attachments. It is not a means to enjoy yourself shamelessly or indulge the senses in pleasure-seeking, for these too are delusions. This is apparently a niche marketing book aimed at women who want to find a way to relax. As such, it has some value for dabblers, but anyone who is actually interested in meditation should look elsewhere.	2001-04-02
US	52769408	R2JDT72G0BMZ91	0224611232	543612563	Cannonball Simp	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Beautiful classic	Burningham's classic is as beautifully illustrated as any of his books, and is filled with memorable images. It begins as a very sad story about a stray dog, who must face the perils of cats, rats, and the dogcatcher before finally finding her way to a circus, where she is adopted by a kindly clown. The clown is in danger of losing his job, because crowds do not like his act. Simp decides to help her benefactor by climbing into a cannon when nobody (including the clown) is looking and being fired through a hoop at the climax of the clown's act. She is a big hit, and they all live happily ever after. This book shows how a good soul can muddle through in the face of adversity, and how kindness begets kindness. There are many words on each page, making it appropriate to read aloud to K-2nd graders, or to preschoolers who can sit still for the words.	2001-03-28

It is a wonderful true story, written for a western audience by a distinctly adventurous man. Anyone interested in the mystery of this isolated country will find some of the reality emerge in this affectionate, straightforward, well-paced volume.	2001-03-16

(He chose not to venture to the south, out of a repugnance for slavery.) This brief account of his travels begins with optimism and the usual Dickens eye for the comic. As it goes on, we begin to sense the weariness of the journey and the author's disappointment with what he found. We get a vivid picture of a nation still being built, quite literally in the case of frontier places. The fine introduction to the Penguin edition places this work in the context of English travel narratives of the time. This edition is also well footnoted and contains a sampling of letters Dickens wrote to friends at home, in which he is quite candid. Modern readers may find fascinating glimpses of American life at the time (such as the disgusting habit of spitting and the nastiness of the press), but may be less interested than the author was in prisons, courts, and other public institutions. Furthermore, some places are passed over cursorily, but this is to keep the journey moving along. (My favorite parts are the anecdotes about individual characters that Dickens meets while travelling.) As the introduction suggests, this book is as much about Dickens and his personal evolution as it is about America, despite the fact that Dickens does not speak extensively of the inconveniences he faced due to his fame. The trip was to inspire parts of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; and must be taken in the context of Dickens' career - some of the views herein were moderated by a second trip to America later in life.	2001-03-15

It tells the story of a young boy whose favorite thing is dragons. When he learns that there are real dragons on the island of Komodo (which is in fact true - huge monitor lizards inhabit the island) he takes a plane there. Distressed by the many tourists, he takes off on his own for a very private, magical, fleeting moment of discovering a Komodo dragon in the wild. The book has bits of subtle humor in it - for example, the text deadpans that &quot;it is always easy to find me in a crowd because of my dragon T-shirt&quot; - while the illustration shows a huge crowd of kids that actually demands a lot of searching to find our hero! Preschool/1st grade nature lovers and explorers will enjoy this gently exciting tale. A brief postscript talks about real Komodo dragons.	2001-03-08

Libraries would do well to own it, as would browsers and thoughtful seekers. Here we find interviews with Americans from a range of faith traditions - everyone from a Catholic Bishop to a Quaker pacifist to a Wiccan writer to a Hindu doctor. Each one recounts their own personal experiences, and how they were drawn to the paths they chose to follow. It is this personal storytelling that makes the book most appealing - too often religion is seen merely as a set of stories or rules. Here we see it operating in the lives of individuals. There is a distinct emphasis on interfaith tolerance, acceptance of all (women, gays, etc.), and social activism that may prove inspiring to young people. Some interviews are more interesting or relevant than others to me, but of course it depends on your point of view. Each chapter ends with a helpful list of further readings and approved web sites.	2001-02-15

I am a big fan of Seymour Simon's books - he always presents interesting information, clear prose, and beautiful pictures. His truck book, however, seems to suffer from the use of file photos as illustrations instead of any pictures taken just for the book. A few of his photos are not sufficiently illustrative of his text - like his photo of a tractor shows only half of a tractor in dim light. Still, there are plenty of young truck fans out there, and you could do lots worse than this concise book.	2001-02-12

I can honestly say I would recommend it for anyone in 5th grade right on up to senior citizens. (&quot;A Year Down Yonder&quot; also stands alone very well - you don't need to have read &quot;A Long Way From Chicago&quot; in order to understand or enjoy this one.) The narrator is a 15 year old girl who is sent from Chicago to live with her grandmother in a rural town during the depression. We quickly come to appreciate the comic aspects of small-town life, but most especially we enjoy the wily ways of the grandmother, who is nobody's fool and mischievous to boot. At the same time, we admire her toughness and the warm heart behind the hard exterior. Each chapter is an amusing anecdote all its own, as we follow the town through a year from fall to summer. Small town incidents like halloween pranks, Christmas plays, ladies' luncheons and big storms become masterfully funny stories. Moments of this coming-of-age story are genuinely touching, while mirth prevails throughout. You will have a great time reading this one.	2001-02-08

Its plot is simple enough on the surface, about a sailor who guides a steamer up the Congo in search of a vaunted ivory trader. But beneath the surface, in a palpable atmosphere of unease, lie the book's complicated themes. This isn't just a condemnation of European activity in Africa, but a glimpse at the evil within every man. In some ways this book is a precursor to &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and other twentieth century books of despair, and yet Conrad does not leave the reader without hope. In skilful, mystical passages about light and dark, black and white, tall and short, jungle and sepulchre, Conrad gives us much food for thought about the nature of humankind and the possibilities for both good and evil. I see this book more as a warning than a simple cry of despair - though it pays ample attention to &quot;the horror&quot; of it all.	2001-01-25

The plot is simple but pleasing for preschoolers - the kids bundle up, go out, make a snowman, sled, skate, fall down, and come back in to get warm. The story is told in curt rhyming verses, that sometimes strain a bit in ways that small kids won't understand (a hat is a &quot;proper topper,&quot; for example), but the main pleasure of this book is its visual aspect. Good winter fun.	2001-01-24

One was his famous &quot;Lennon Remembers&quot; interviews with Rolling Stone in 1970, and the other was this one, shortly before his death in 1980. Lennon was a complex man, and it is interesting to compare his attitudes among the two milestone interviews. Yet this one (conducted over several days) stands alone for its insights into Lennon's personal life, his relationship with Yoko, his philosophising, and his song-by-song discussion of his work, both with the Beatles and afterwards. It offers an unprecedented glimpse into his mindset and outlook at the time of his death, filled with the usual engaging Lennon wit and wisdom. Lennon comes across not just as a vital source of information about his own life and career but as an interesting conversationalist, period. We are also treated to Sheff's brief glimpses of Lennon and Ono at work on their &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; album. This book is an important document for anyone interested in the man or his music.	2001-01-23

Simply put, kids love it. (Adults love it, too.) The premise of a poor starving boy who lives near the most wonderful and secretive candy factory in the world is inspired. Dahl has a skillful knack for making you want to read the next chapter. Once you meet the interesting characters such as Charlie's Grandpa Joe, and hear about the mythical Mr. Wonka, you are hooked. The pace accelerates as the world learns that Mr. Wonka will allow five lucky children into his secretive factory, if they happen to buy a candy bar that has a golden ticket in it. The winners are mostly awful brats - each one is presented as an example of how NOT to behave. There's something Dickensian in Dahl's wild wit and unabashed morals. But what of Charlie, our hero? How can he find a ticket when he can't even afford a candy bar? I won't give the rest away (there's much more to this plot), but suffice it to say that there are moments of pure excitement and fun throughout this book that will be remembered for a lifetime. And as a children's librarian, I urge you: please have your kids read this book instead of just showing them the movie version. Let them imagine it for themselves first.	2001-01-03

Eventually he goes off into the woods, where he discovers a cave. Seeing some rocks shaped like a bear, Henry is frightened and runs outside. (There is much comic irony to this moment, as Henry is only frightened by rocks, while the viewer can see what he can't, that there are real though harmless-looking bears asleep behind the rocks!) Now it is dark, and a party of neighbors has been sent to look for Henry. In another comic twist, Henry goes around in circles while the search party follows in circles, and never the twain meet. Henry arrives nonchalantly home, and the search party shows up eventually to be welcomed in for coffee while Henry goes up to bed. There he reads about exploring the jungle, and we are left to wonder what ideas that will put in his head! My summary does scant justice to the beauty of the painted illustrations, the memorable images, the gentle humor, or the genuine excitement of this story. Kids will not forget it.	2000-12-27

One was that the movie plot bears such little resemblance to the original classic book &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; by Dr. Seuss that a different book was in order. The other was to make another buck and add to the millions they already spent and recouped on this entire Grinch project. I can only say that the movie is a corrupted failure that shouldn't presume to call itself the Grinch, and any book based directly on the movie is just as silly (and extremely bizarre; young kids might be frightened by these photographs.)	2000-12-22

US	52769408	R2WWSJHEIC667U	0679887768	389386159	Father Christmas	Books	5	20	22	N	N	A Classic	This beautiful and comic picture book stands as one of Briggs' finest achievements. A pop song in the nineties asked the famous question &quot;What if God were on of us?&quot; This book answers a different intriguing question - what if Santa Claus were just an ordinary bloke? In his inimitable careful style, Briggs follows Father Christmas through his ordinary routine on December 24th and 25th. Each page is a series of illustrative panels, rather like a comic book, though the artistic style is the same kind of fine color work Briggs used in &quot;The Snowman.&quot; Many panels are silent, or else punctuated by our hero's curmudgeonly mutterings (&quot;blooming chimneys!&quot;) Father Christmas is rudely awoken by his alarm clock on December 24th, in an ordinary semidetached home in England somewhere (this is a very British book.) He gets up, has breakfast, feeds the dog and cat, gets some presents from storage in the barn, hitches up a few deer, and is off through various kinds of weather to visit various kinds of homes, mildly complaining about his hardships the entire time. The humor of the book's tone grows on the reader as the story proceeds. At last he finishes his rounds at dawn and comes home to a most pleasant Christmas of a warm bath, a good meal, and some holiday brochures. Then we follow him up to bed. I reread this book every Christmas, with equal joy each time. It is funny in a slightly irreverent way, but it still captures the warmth and joy of a Christmas well spent. Kids may enjoy the comic book format of the story, but I think this book can be even better enjoyed by adults who can imbibe its full wit.	2000-12-12

Here at last we can gaze at this delightful tale. It's all here: Rey's special mastery of facial expressions, his knack for appealing character, his optimism and whimsy, his bright and gorgeous watercolor strokes, and his imaginative storytelling. The sweeping adventure tale tells of a penguin's voyages from the freezing pole all the way to the African desert and back, along the way riding boats, camels, and perilous ocean waves.  This book stands up as well as any of his other fine books, be they &quot;Curious George&quot; or &quot;Pretzel&quot; (about a long dachsund) or his pictures for &quot;Katy No-Pocket&quot; (about a kangaroo.) (Like many picture books from earlier in the century, this one is told with a decent amount of text, and is thus suited for children whose attention span lasts longer than the average quick-cut videotape. Therefore, it may be better to share this one-on-one than to read it to large groups of preschoolers.) All in all, a joy, with dazzling reproductions of Rey's simple and excellent artwork.	2000-11-14

This offbeat small-press offering is more for connoisseurs of his work. It collects some postcard series by Mr. Gorey, as ever using an anagram for the author's name, in this case Dogear Wryde. The artwork is the usual brilliant, careful pen-and-ink fare. &quot;Scenes de Ballet,&quot; the first series, pokes hilarious fun at the pretensions of the high arts with absurd ballet names and costumes (though you may need some understanding of French to get some of the joke.) &quot;Menaced Objects&quot; is my favorite series, by far the funniest. It depicts lackluster objects like a spool of thread and a &quot;tray of calling cards&quot; supposedly in peril from other vaguely menacing presences. (My personal favorite: &quot;Formal glove shone on by gibbous moon.&quot;) &quot;Arms for Oblivion&quot; is a drawn-out joke displaying utterly forgettable objects in forgettable locations. It's good for a smirk, though you may not return to it often. &quot;Interpretive Series&quot; shows a creature acting out various adjectives that begin with the letter &quot;I.&quot; These indeed would make wonderful postcards, though in book form one needn't read them more than once. (I wonder where I can get actual postcards. This reprint book is valuable as a catalog of the master's work, but the work was indeed intended to post.) &quot;Neglected Murderesses&quot; is exactly the kind of morbid humor one would expect, a rogues' gallery of obscure women who used odd means of killing people (such as tipping their wheelchairs over precipices and braining someone with a bowling ball). &quot;Tragedies Topiares&quot; is outrageously funny because the entire premise is so bizarre - various topiaries (sculpted shrubbery) are held up as examples of menace; a shrubbery automobile is seen apparently running somebody over, etc. The contextlesness of the whole thing is marvelous. &quot;Whatever Next&quot; is an intentionally boring series of views of obscure corners of rooms, with no text atall. Again, a one-time look, although one wonders how Gorey could spend so much time to so carefully render this curious joke. Overall, this book is a highly amusing browse for a rainy day, but it helps if you were a fan already.	2000-11-10

The first is &quot;Pegasus Descending,&quot; an earlier collection of bad verse that was among the first of its kind. (I think it may come back into print in 2001?) Hilarious. The other is the catalog of &quot;Moba,&quot; the Museum of Bad Art in Massachusetts. Lord, are those paintings funny.	2000-10-27

As far as I know it is the only book on the subject. I do hope that eventually someone will sit down and write a coherent and better one. A lot of what Priore gives us is primary source material, articles and clippings and recording charts from the 1966-67 period. Some of these articles, especially &quot;Goodbye Surfing, Hello God&quot; and a few attempts to reconstruct a proper list of what was recorded for the project are of value. A lot of the newspaper clippings are repetitive and meaningless, and some of the photographs are marred by the author's writing his own unfunny voice bubbles on them. Indeed, Priore's own writing is poor (especially his ridiculous reliance on the word &quot;bitchin'&quot;), though it does convey a lot of enthusiasm. This is the personal scrapbook of an obsessive fan. There are nuggets of good information in this mess, but you will need to sift. It's a shame that a more coherent and scholarly digestion of this material hasn't yet been written, and I eagerly await the day. Meanwhile, curious fans should all be listening to the &quot;Smile&quot; era recordings that are provided, with excellent sound quality, on the box set &quot;Good Vibrations - 30 Years of the Beach Boys.&quot;	2000-09-29

At first it seems quite disjointed and jumpy, more a series of random anecdotes than any sort of linear history. However, it builds as it goes along. The anecdotes become engrossing and amusing, and eventually a lot of it fits together to make some important points. It refutes the idea that the library was burned by Caesar, or that it even contained its original collection by the time it was burned by conquering Moslems. It also gives a picture of how and where the library was housed within the palace walls, which has often been a subject of confusion. The topic is overall fascinating, so that even those of us who aren't familiar with the many classical names that flit in and out of these chapters can get something out of it all. This may not be the definitive book on the subject (anybody want to write one?), but it is well worth perusing.	2000-09-27

Carefully researched and  footnoted, the book also includes a list of further readings and an index.  The body of the book is clearly written and substantial - indeed, adults  interested in the subject would also do well with this one. It contains  many direct quotes from primary sources, along with many fascinating  photographs of the people involved, and hand-drawn illustrations by Sioux  people who witnessed these events. The facts are presented in a  straightforward manner, and while there is natural sympathy towards the  unjustly dispossessed tribes herein, overall the book is remarkably  balanced. Depth is given to people such as Custer and Major James Walsh. I  like the way readers may draw their own conclusions rather than having them  forced. There are few clear heroes or villains here, rather there is  historical truth and tragedy.	2000-09-26

It tells the tale of a mischievous mouse who plays with his food and makes a mess of a human family's kitchen, then retires to bed. Children will love the absurd irresponsibility of it all, especially when Mouse surveys the scene he's created himself: &quot;Who made this awful mess?&quot; said Mouse, &quot;These people need to clean their house!&quot; Adults will enjoy witty moments such as Mouse raking corn flakes with a fork as if they were leaves, and jumping into the pile. This one also makes a good read-aloud for storytimes.	2000-09-25

It tells the story from the point of view of a 12-year old son in an upscale California family who decide to adopt a black toddler. The community disapproves, and the family must ask themselves difficult questions. With short chapters, the book makes a quick and easy read for teenagers, but it fails to draw many conclusions except for uncertanties. Perhaps this makes it more believable, but it does not make it more readable.	2000-09-25

Montogmery could never equal the mastery of the &quot;Choose Your Own  Adventure&quot; genre that Edward Packard did. Too often his books were  preachy and overly arbitrary. This book may be his best effort, however,  telling a fairly gripping series of adventures of your search for the lost  city of Atlantis.

Competent  journalist Hunter Davies spent a year observing the Beatles and  interviewing them in their own homes during the heady, fascinating year of  1967. He emerged with a time piece: the Beatles as they were at that time,  reflecting on what came before and unaware of what was yet to come. A  chapter describing the writing and recording of &quot;With a Little Help  From My Friends,&quot; &quot;Getting Better,&quot; and &quot;Magical  Mystery Tour&quot; offers  unique and especially valuable glimpses of the  Beatles at work. Chapters depicting the home life and personal outlook of  each Beatle are also very interesting. I must also say that for an  authorised biography, this is remarkably honest. Perceptive readers will be  able to detect the whole truth here, and a fine introduction written by the  author years later helps fill in any gaps. Apart from being hugely  entertaining, this book is a tremendous boon to historians interested in  the Beatles.	2000-09-06

This book is a fine sampler of some favorites among  the paintings, lavishly reproduced in color and featuring intelligent  commentaries about each one. Highlights include famous works by Sargent,  Rembrandt, Munch, and Renoir, although you may also discover some hidden  gems that you were not previously aware of.

Hilary Knight is also the illustrator of Kay Thompson's &quot;Eloise&quot; books, but here he  shines on his own with a masterpiece. The more famous &quot;Where's  Waldo&quot; books seem but a pale imitation of this earlier, more original  winner. For one thing, Knight's book is full of wit. It even has something  of a plot, about a clever orangutan who is allowed to escape from the zoo  by his friendly keeper. Every time he escapes, the keeper goes to look for  him. Knight's panoramas invite hours of searching, not only because Wallace  is hidden in them somewhere but also because the pictures are fraught with  hilarious activity. Kids will read the book through once and find Wallace,  but perceptive ones will then return to the book innumerable times because  Knight has generously included at least seven other characters who recur in  the backgrounds of every fun-filled page, among them a jogger and a  knitting lady. Filled with winning characters and gorgeous pictures, this  classic definitely deserves to be restored to its rightful place as THE  find-the-character book. I recommend owning it. I'm still studying the  pictures, even in adulthood!	2000-08-21

Many  adults remember this book from their childhoods, and I strongly suggest  that they reread it every now and again. Seuss begins with a very engaging  premise to draw the reader in - an old mysterious person locked in a tower  in a ruined wastelend that will tell you a story if you ask carefully. The  story he tells is of himself in the past, when he came to a thriving  environment and set up shop exploiting the resources of the area. This  draws the Jeremiads of the Lorax, who points out the ill consequences at  every turn. The narrator ignores them, not out of ill will towards the  environment but out of ignorance and the belief that he can do whatever he  likes anyhow. In the end, the place is utterly destroyed and all its  creatures leave, including the Loraz who departs with an infinite sadness  on his face. The story sounds like a dark one, but somehow Seuss's  whimsical rhymes and drawings make it more palatable, though it speaks  harsh truths. The ending is superb and offers hope - a small boy is given  the last seed of the disappeared trees, and asked to do what he can to  renew the land. May we all do the same to the best of our abilities!	2000-08-09

Ebert and some of his old English teachers have written an interesting guidebook, recommending a route that you can take  for an enjoyable day's walk through historic London, visiting parks,  historic homes and grave sights, and a pub lunch. I haven't tried the walk  myself, so I can't vouch for it, but I do know that this book makes me  keenly interested to fly to England and try!	2000-08-09

I guess some older kids and  adults will really get into trying to solve the mystery and searching for  the obscure clues, but honestly, when I finally read the answers in the  back I was dismayed. How is any child supposed to find or figure out any of  these obscure ciphers, or avoid all these red herrings? And who wants to  sit around finding &quot;one hundred and eleven mice&quot; that are hidden  throughout? If your kids want a lavish mystery picture book about animals,  they might prefer &quot;Piggins&quot; by Jane Yolen, which might not  involve hours of searching, but which tells a similar story and won't be so  frustrating. Base is a little too clever for his own good.	2000-08-04

The idea was that inhabitants would live on unleavened bread  and apples, abstain from sex, and expound on the universe. The experiment  lasted only from July to December, when it predictably fell apart. In  adulthood, Louisa trained a comic eye on the whole experience, and wrote  this brief, funny parody of it, with only names changed to protect the  innocent. Also included here are girlhood diaries kept by Louisa during  this experience, which offer insight into what life was like at such a  place in those days. These diaries are made doubly amusing by a few  marginal notes Louisa added to them later in life. For anyone interested in  Alcott family history, or in the crazy days of the transcendentalists (the  19th century's version of the sixties), this short work is a must read.	2000-07-31

As you might imagine, it tells the tale of a lonely guy who bums around the  country with some crazy characters for no particular reason, getting drunk,  trying to meet girls, and living completely in the moment. Kerouac's  flippant style is amusing, often quite funny in waves of cumulative effect,  and made more engaging is his apparent understanding of the sadness beneath  the fun. One can see where Truman Capote's tart quip that &quot;this isn't  writing, it's typing&quot; comes into play, but nevertheless this is surely  the most coherent of all the beatnik books. It's probably inconsistent in  many ways, but who's bothering to keep track of all these friends? Overall,  it doesn't mean as much as most people would imagine, but it is  entertaining for the hell of it.	2000-07-24

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Amphibians for all seasons	Along with Seuss, Lobel is perhaps the most beloved writer and illustrator of beginning readers. In this effort he turns in another winning series of five short tales, each one in plain language but highly entertaining,  enlivened by Lobel's superb two-tone illustrations. Frog and Toad are  distinct and likeable characters, comically foolish in their own ways but  buoyed by their genuine friendship. This book features the added appeal of  stories from all the year round, from winter (how funny they look in big  winter coats!) to spring rain (a genuinely sweet tale) to summer ice cream  (what a mess!) to fall leaf raking (in gift-of-the-magi form, each rakes  the other's yard in secret) and Christmas Eve, perhaps the most pleasant  story of all - nothing sloppy or sentimental, just goodhearted. Readers of  these domestic adventures will also enjoy Lobel's &quot;Owl at Home.&quot;	2000-07-21

Artistically it is beautiful, mixing expressive and energetic line drawings with the occasional full-color painting quite effectively. The story mixes  very comic elements (like the girls all fighting over who will have the dog  sleep on their bed, while their harried nurse keeps getting up in the night  as always) and elements of true poignancy, like when the dog is lost. We  see Madeline in her window looking at the empty streets, sighing &quot;Oh  Genevieve, where can you be? Genevieve, please come back to me.&quot; The  direct, sad, but unsentimental tone of this moment is really moving.  Overall, a most satisfying tale indeed, both in story and in art, with a  happy ending that is sure to please.	2000-07-21

The mixture of an ordinary life of friends,  bullies, and school and the menacing world of dark magic is expertly  handled. Who is sending Lewis strange postcards in the middle of the night?  Who is the tall figure he sees under a street lamp? The story carries  itself forward with excellent pacing, moral dilemmas, and mystery. I think  the magical objects used at the climax ought to have been introduced  beforehand; here they seem to function more like a god from the machine, as  the saying goes. Still, few young readers will mind, they will just want to  know how it all comes out.	2000-07-13

As a children's librarian, I often try to get kids interested in the wonderful Moominbooks. However, only certain children seem to catch on, while many do not. I'm not quite sure why this is so. The Moomins  originated in Finland, where perhaps kids are more attuned to nature and  the world around them, to taking time for subtleties, thinking outside the  box, and quiet wit; instead of being bombarded by extra stimuli all the  time. At any rate, adults as well as kids would do well to investigate a  superb book such as this. Each character has a depth all their own in this  tale of a family who sets sail to discover an island and a mysterious  lighthouse. There they try to understand their new environment, each other,  and themselves. Delightful cartoon drawings by the author illuminate this  wistful, magical book.	2000-07-12

The point is well made, but otherwise this  is a depressing book that seems almost ridiculous at times in its  representation of the tortured artist. In my opinion, this is a book that  few women or Americans would be fond of, but it is thought-provoking for  students of the period.	2000-07-10

These books  are going to keep getting longer and darker - by the end it will be  Dostoevsky! But seriously folks, I want the adults out there to ask  themselves - are you reading these books because you like them and are  genuinely interested in children's literature, or are you reading them  because everybody else seems to be doing it?

I am so glad that this book came out to help make the collection visible to a larger audience. Like bad poetry (see &quot;Pegasus  Descending&quot; by Waldrop), bad art at its best is unbelievably  hilarious. Some bad art is merely bad, but the utter sincerity with which  the works in this collection were painted accounts for much laughter. If by  some chance you can't tell why the thing is so bad, there are helpful  titles and captions by the authors to explain it to you.

This book, however, is a highly personal tale that he seeks to tell, and it is a rather complex and mystical one - for  this reason I recommend it more for adults, though there's no harm in  reading it to your child if you think it will go over (just don't be  surprised if they don't appreciate it as you do.) I say the tale is  complex, because the plot has many layers. Sis himself is a child in Cold  War Europe, whose father disappears. The father then returns, saying he had  been sent to make documentary films in Tibet. His memories are contained in  a red box, which Sis does not open until later in life. These memories tell  of tales both possible (meeting the Dalai Lama, Chinese takeover of Tibet)  and exxaggerated (mythical cities, wild adventures, etc.) The overall tone  of the book is not a political one, but a spiritual one. Having taken us  through a dazzling series of illustrated mandalas and different colored  rooms, Sis concludes that he isn't really sure what went on with his father  in Tibet, and whether it was all a mystical dream on the part of his father  or on the part of himself. It's difficult to explain all this, but I hope  you get the picture as to how sophisticated the book really is. It will  merit careful revisiting by adults, and its beautiful, stylized artwork and  haunting mysticism will render rich rewards.	2000-06-23

For my money it is Dahl's best book, (though &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Mister Fox&quot; come close.) I think  that although the intended audience of kids is sure to enjoy it, adults too  would appreciate the tale. It is not only a ripping good adventure story,  about a boy and his father who attempt to poach pheasants from a wicked  landowner, but an atmospheric one as well - we can feel the palpable  thrills in the early fall air as the characters plot the fine art of  poaching for the pure private pleasure of it, like any great artists. As  with all of Dahl, this book has moments of great comedy as well as a love  for food and freedom, all of which appeal to its audience. There is also  the subtly tender relationship between Danny and his father that add depth  to the story. Well, we could go on. All I can say is that anyone who can  read, adult or child, will thank themselves for reading this one.	2000-06-20

But that doesn't matter - it's a fine novel, depicting the life  of a young boy growing up with his grandparents and dogs in the mountains  of Cherokee country in the Depression. The young boy's point of view makes  for many comic and touching moments. We grow to care about these characters  and their struggle to live free amidst discrimination a good deal, which  makes the end all the more emotional. This is a fine book for both adults  and junior high/high school readers.	2000-06-13

He has dug up all the dirt he can find, all of which we could have imagined and none of which tells you much about any of the music or  personalities involved. There's more information here about certain record  company executives and swindlers than there is about Al Jardine or many of  the other group members. It's amusing enough for an airplane ride, but  that's about all.	2000-05-25

The gentle story of an elderly woman's retirement while her forceful  children squabble over unimportant matters is at once comic and poignant.  The author has peppered the tale with curious, memorable characters, among  them the eccentric art collector who is allowed to eat in portrait  galleries because museums hope he will donate to them when he dies; the  benign landlord Bucktrout, who sees Lady Slain's desire for peace at home;  and the coffin maker who pictures people dead to reveal their true  characters. This fine little masterpiece deserves to be read today.	2000-05-24

Like  many Dickens novels, this one is long. Yet it reads rather quickly, because  of the author's unfailing eye for comedy, even amid adversity. The plot of  this novel is a little more carefully wrought than some of Dickens' earlier  works, especially as regards the plot thread about Emily; though to the  modern reader it may still seem rambling and in parts simplistic. Yet the  novel excels as no other in its conjuring of characters - you will never  forget them, down to the smallest bit players. Sometimes people assume that  because the protagonist is a child at the outset, that this is a book for  kids to read. It isn't; but it is a great novel. Tolstoy thought it a  masterpiece, and I concur.	2000-05-23

I don't know if it is because of the translation,  but the English versions of his short poems occasionally and unfortunately  fall off the meter.

Edward knew Thoreau up until the latter's death in 1862, when Edward was about 17. He has supplemented his  own memory with interviews and anectdotes given him by other Concord  citizens who knew the Thoreau family. These writings are a valuable  resource for anyone who is researching Thoreau, with its humanizing slant  and defence of its subject against perceived misunderstandings by the  public. Any Thoreau fan will find this brief tract illuminating and  amusing.	2000-05-15

However, their titles are exact, so I will assume that  this is the book collected by Peter Haining and published in the 1990s.  This book is a great boon to the many obsessed fans and scholars of Doyle's  work, as it reprints many obscure articles, stories, and plays that might  otherwise be unavailable. Little of this material approaches the quality we  expect of the regular Holmes canon, but much of it is interesting. This  book contains: Two commentaries by Conan Doyle about his creation, neither  of which sheds much new light. Two brief Doyle parodies of his own  characters, neither of which are very funny. Two short stories in which a  noted detective that many believe to be Holmes plays a small and unfruitful  letter-writing part. A fascinating plot outline by Doyle for a story he  never wrote. A poem Doyle wrote to defend himself against a critic. Two of  Doyle's other short stories, that have much less to do with Holmes than Mr.  Haining seems to imagine, but one of which, &quot;The Mystery at Uncle  Jeremy's Household&quot; is a ripping good yarn anyway. A long story called  &quot;The Adventure of the Tall Man&quot; which Mr. Haining wants to  believe is written by Doyle, but which stylistically stinks to high heaven  of being written by someone else. Two short plays by Doyle, one of which is  an odd Holmes comedy and the other of which is an excellent stage version  of what would become &quot;The Mazarin Stone.&quot; Also, a most  interesting list of Doyle's own favorite Holmes stories. All in all, this  is a hodge-podge, valuable to completists and students of Holmes.	2000-05-10

The dark portrait of the loveless marriage among the Dombeys is remarkably compelling. As ever, there are moments of brilliant comedy to lighten the mood, here involving the characters of Captain Cuttle  (a fine, warm creation) and Babstock. A must read for Dickens fans who want  to understand how his art developed.	2000-05-09

Amazingly, he comes up with a winner. His writing style is sophisticated yet fluid and enjoyable. Ample maps are provided, both  political and geographic, so we know what is going on and where. Special  attention is paid to the architectural feats of India, complemented by  photographs and a thorough index. This book would serve as a fine  introduction to either students or casual readers who want to begin to  delve into the Asian subcontinent.	2000-03-28

Montgomery's work  was pretty incoherent, but this one offers a consistent tone and unified  set of plots that make it among the better of the &quot;Choose Your Own  Adventure&quot; games.

Accordingly, we get the whole western panorama here, from gambling saloons  to small town newspapers to desperadoes, gold prospecting, ranching, etc.  Parts of this one do seem to bog down here and there, as you keep endlessly  saddling up to go to Silver Springs, and not really getting anywhere.

Hilary Knight's drawings have always been fantastic, expressive and fluid - see Kay Thompspon's &quot;Eloise&quot;  books, now back in print. In addition to the wonderful device of searching  for the title character in a complicated scene, Knight enlivened this book  with a PLOT - a winning one, about an irascable orangutan escaping from the  zoo. And when you finally find him, he's always in such funny places! The  text is full of humor too. And, not only can you search for Wallace, but  close observers will note that other characters recur in these scenes,  doubling the fun as you search for a number of people - among them a  jogger, a mischievous girl, and an old lady knitting - in various settings.  Great fun, an original.	2000-03-13

This essay is an important first attempt to place Gorey's unique vision into some kind of context, and  though quite descriptive, it doesn't reveal a whole lot to me. The best  part of the book is plates of some of Gorey's less well-known material, his  stage curtain backdrops, etc. Fans of Gorey will appreciate a glimpse of  these things for their collections. Those unfamiliar with his work would  find a better introduction with one of the &quot;Amphigorey&quot;  treasuries.	2000-03-08

Gorey is a one-of-a-kind genius, though these are not all his best works - most of those are in the first of the &quot;Amphigorey&quot; series. Nevertheless, we are treated to  some visually stunning works - &quot;The Sopping Thursday,&quot;  &quot;L'heure Bleu,&quot; and all of them, really - and some first rate  Gorey humor in &quot;The Blue Aspic,&quot; &quot;The Broken Spoke,&quot;  and the adverbial wordplay in &quot;The Glorious Nosebleed.&quot; Perhaps  the greatest inclusion is &quot;The Awdrey-Gore Legacy,&quot; an anigramic,  enigmatic piece that creates genuine interest upon further study of its  vagueries; plus it is funny. For Gorey fans, an essential part of your  collection.	2000-02-07

It is up to his usual snuff, however, with an atmosphere of quiet distress and beautiful illustrations. Gorey's famous morbid humor kicks in towards the  end, when after eating flour and water sauce for days a member of the  household dies and is buried on Christmas Eve, while the family paints the  ornaments black. The usual odd Gorey fare, brilliant in its own way.	1999-12-17

Much of her portrayal of this bizarre, insouciant living may be  accurate, but I must confess that the writing style is offputting and  really not very good. Despite this, Block somehow manages to create  sympathy for her character, even though by many standards she participates  in an immoral universe. Some teens might find it all appealing.	1999-12-08

My only objection is the use of  some scientific biology words which may be common enough among scientists  but which are curveballs for us lay folk. Otherwise it's a fine read.

Anyway, I never felt much for this narrator, who goes  wandering around smoking hash and matter-of-factly looking up Brion Gysin  (who for some reason keeps letting him in) whenever he happens to be in  Morocco. In the end he manages to take a completely fascinating cultural  and musical world and figure out little about it. What was the point? I  still don't know.

The parts with the Dursleys were  funny, but the rest of it lacked the same level of humor. Rowling has been  very inventive in creating this world, but so have a lot of other authors.	1999-10-28
