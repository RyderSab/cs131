I started the book late one evening and stayed up way too late that night. I finished it the next day.<br /><br />It was an excellent read. I applaud the writer for being able to keep the reader on edge all of the way through the novel. I liked all the characters as well as his excellent storyline and development.<br /><br />I believe that this is only his second book, but I predict that there will be a lot more before he's finished!<br /><br />Read it........you'll be glad you did!	2005-01-29

He makes the characters literally come to life with his 'not too far fetched' schemes and quick wit.<br /><br />I found this to be probably his best work to date.  It was the only one the I honestly didn't want to finish!

John Grisham has never written a bad book...only great ones and even greater ones!  The Last Juror is not an exception.<br />The characters were real and the storyline was believable. In his true writing style, Grisham did a supurb job of telling the story.  This is one of those books you really don't want to finish!<br />The beginning is fast...the middle is steady...and the ending is wonderful!<br />I won't give it away here. I'll just challenge the reader to pick it up, read it for five minutes, and just try to put it down!<br />Buster Wasden<br />Albany, Ga	2004-02-14

I think that Dr LeHaye and Mr Jenkins have done an excellent job relating the &quot;End of the Ages&quot; to us.  While I may differ with some of the theology, I think it's an excellent account of St. John's Revelation of Jesus Christ.  This not only tells the story but makes you really soul search yourself to make sure that you are where you need to be. Thank the Lord, I am!<br />I am anxiously awaiting the final book, &quot;The Glorious Appearing&quot;  of Jesus Christ.	2003-04-26

I found it to be quite wholesome and interesting.It is refreshing to read a modern novel without all the vulgar language that most authors today feel nessessary to inject.  I am from the South and have been in Connecticut only on one occasion. It was a beautiful state. I only wish I could have seen  more of it.<br />The book is fiction to say the least. I can't imagine this plot in real life,however, it is possible.  I thought Archer probably dug down deep to come up with the numerous plots.  I especially liked the courtroom discourses and arguments. It was quite believable.  The election process was fascinating. I seem to remember this method of counting ballots from the last presidential election.  I was wondering throughout the book, how it would end. I was completely taken back with the surprise ending. I was afraid that it would be 'onesided', but Archer managed to pull it of well.  I still like his work and will continue to read more of Jeffrey Archer in the future.	2003-02-15

I guess that the characters are so beleivable and can get in the same jams as all of us, that I relate very well with them.<br />My favorite Grippando book is A Kings Ransom, but Beyond Suspicion was really close. Jack Swytech is a great character. I hope that James will continue to use him in future works.<br />The ending is teriffic.....I never saw it coming!<br />Don't start this unless you intend to finish it!

The first nine were excellent, however, number 10 leaves me cold.  I had a difficult time remembering all of the characters. It seems that there are too many to keep up with now.  The first 150 pages were more of a &quot;catch up&quot; exercise and not a new plot.<br />The biblical truths were good. I believe as Dr Lahaye does and find no fault there, but please try in the future to leave out some of the characters.  It's too confusing.	2002-07-12

Well, I thought I  would never say it, but.....this was the worst book that I have ever read!  I didn't think that James Patterson was capable of writing such junk!<br />He has tried to mix religion with the occult...didn't  work!  He researched the Catholic Church pretty well, but didn't give  enough credit to the faith of those folks.....the very idea that there  would be another virgin birth...hey, why did you go there?
