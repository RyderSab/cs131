There are many similarities between both books when it comes to the writing style, the underlying suspense of where the book will take you at the end.<br />It's hard to give details of the story without giving away the book - but Selah was born to a young mother who wasn't ready to be a mom herself.  So she ended up being raised by her grandmother - this book will take you from her childhood up to a grown, married woman and how the actions of her past now affect her as an individual, spouse, and career woman.	2003-08-22

Lori Gottlieb did an excellent job of putting questions in your head of how it is that we can let society can make one think they must look, feel, and act a certain way.<br />Remember that this book is also referring to the 1970s and there was also a lot less information on anorexia at that time, so there are parts in the book when you will not believe the way Lori's situation was handled (with both family and medical staff).  The book is both humorous and poignant with great insight on anorexia looking through the eyes of an adolescent girl. This is an extremely great book and very true in all aspects of what a person thinks when they do have an eating disorder.	2003-04-26

Their occupations range from book and article writers, to psychologists, speakers, teachers, parents, and more. Having many authors, instead of just one, gives this book an advantage over one author's opinion. It was definitely written to spark an emotion in everybody to make change. The book's topic effects and influences everybody in some way in life to make a change, even if it's just within themselves. It succeeded in doing so. The book analyzes the factors in our culture, which promote and support not only rape, but also sexual assault, and harassment. It also presents ideas and methods to end it. All the sections throughout this book are linked nicely together giving it a strong analytical flow from all the authors - all seeking nothing less than a fundamental culture change with a method achieve it through the change of power, gender, race, and religion.	2003-01-02

If you are easily embarrassed in public...I would advise only reading this book at alone. You can not hold the laughter in. Moving on in the book it takes you through his college years and odd jobs...up to his move with his significant other to France.<br />Most favorite chapters would be \\"Big Boy\\", which is solely dedicated to a turd! Other chapters that were among my top picks were all the chapters regarding the move to France.
