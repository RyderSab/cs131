There are very young children characters put in jeopardy. (A cozy no-no). A four year old girl's mother is poisoned and she's left in the care of a group of young single parents. (Would this happen in real life?  Probably not without the supervision of a Social Service). This same little kid is traumatized when she finds the body of her mother's friend.  The setting is the college where the protagonist teaches rather than the usual antique show.  There are few characters so not much of a mystery.  We know early on that it's one of a only a few disagreeable suspects.<br /><br />Maggie has no Watson.  The fun of cozies is meeting again the likeable characters from earlier books.  No Will Brewster, no Gussie to help within this story.  Maggie withholds evidence from the police, out of character for the Maggie of the earlier books.  The motive of the murder was to hide the kinky bondage sex of a wealthy college supporter who will live to endulge his proclivities another day.  The only character I liked was Winslow Homer, Maggie's cat and also the only element in this book of a true cozy.	2005-08-29

But not at the same time as this particular group of guests, the Hargreaves family.  They are gathered to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Lionel and Emily.  Included in the party are their sons and daughters-in-law, an unmarried son, as well as Lionel's brother, Maurice, the financial patriarch of the family and first victim.  Caroline finds his body in the gazebo where he'd gone to do some uninterrupted paperwork.<br /><br />The police are called, of course, and are represented by Lt. Hank Nightingale and Sgt. Davies.  Caroline wants to help get the case cleared up so she can get on with her innkeeping.  At first, Lt. Nightingale is resistant but comes to recognize her ideas as valid.<br /><br />This book meets all the requirements of a good mystery.  The first crime occurs early on, there are many interesting suspects, the setting is fabulous and there is just a hint of romance as the Lt. becomes attracted to Caroline.  The denunciation at the end is worthy of a Poirot.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic mysteries.	2005-08-22

I really enjoyed this book, perhaps more so than other reviewers because I've never seen \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" and if I read the book, it's decades ago, so I came to this with an open mind.  And I'm reading it because it's a Sherlock Holmes story.  I've read and re-read the originals and enjoy the pastiches if they capture the voice or essence of Doyle's work.<br /><br />I read Meyer's first two Holmes books but missed this one somehow for over a decade. It's as good as the earlier ones, I think.  Holmes is telling the story and it sounds like him and what we have of Watson is very Watson-like.  Holmes as an orchestra violinist is believable.  And what fun it is!  What a villanous villain Nobody is.  And what an attractive bunch of characters, the innocent Christine, helpful, friendly Ponelle. Holmes is not a man who cultivates friends.  Even \\"that woman\\" turns up wearing her masculine disguise.  And that labyrinth of basements beneath the Opera House.  I haven't a clue if the really exist or if they figured in \\"Phantom\\", but they made a fine setting for this story.<br /><br />I recommend that you read it for all these reasons.	2005-08-12

Hughes, Charlotte Armstrong, Patricia Highsmith, and Mignon G. Eberhart.<br /><br />The lives are all interesting if you enjoy reading biography.  The author has done a credible job of analysing the work of these women, summarizing the plots of their best work and also pointing out the shortcomings of the books that were not up to each woman's best effort.  And, of course, he has included the usual biographical data, date and place of birth, family, education and awards.  He has included a bibliography of each writer's work in their section, and a short list of the names of writers currently in publication who write in a similar style.  Also, the book is fully indexed.<br /><br />While I have read some work of at least five of the seven women, my favorite is Phoebe Atwood Taylor and her inclusion is the reason I bought the book.  I have read and sometimes re-read all of her books.  Her life had none of the drama of Millar's, for example, whose life had elements of tragedy and periods of anguish, or Highsmith, who was angry, usually lonely and who acknowledged being lesbian at the age of 69.  I was saddened to read that of all these writers who garnered such awards as Mystery Writer's of America Grand Master (Millar) and two Edgars (Hughes) and the Malice Domestic Lifetime Acheivement (Eberhard) plus numerous others, Atwood Taylor received none, not even a nomination.<br /><br />But then I was comforted by an imagined \\"tea\\" in the corner of heaven reserved for mystery writers.  The ladies are reminising about their earthly success and PAT has the last word because her amusing, regional mysteries are still being printed, read and enjoyed thirty years after her death.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that amazon.com did not include in their book description a list of the authors covered in this book.

This last of the Asey Mayo mysteries opens with the whole town of Quanomet involved in a local historical pageant.  A chance visitor, Buff Orpington, meets an old friend, Kay and her son Bobby.  He'd been best man at her wedding about 8 years before.  She lost her husband and he his friend in the war.  She tells him of all the efforts to sabotage the pageant, grandstand braces have been sawed, nails put in tires, etc. Kay has asked Asey Mayo to help figure out who is trying to ruin the event.  Then the historical know-it-all, Muriel Babcock, is murdered in the cemetery.  Not long after Asey turns up, he gets biffed over the head too.  There are elusive clues and much chasing around to talk to suspects in borrowed cars because someone keeps filching Asey's Porter.  The Doc is there mouthing off, and Jenny, with her fascination with genealogy, helps too with the problem of the irregular tombstone.  Even little Bobby helps and is rewarded with the gift of a geiger counter, his heart's desire.<br /><br />This is a book I'll read again just to pick up on elements I've missed the first time through.	2005-06-15

This book has won scads of awards.  I don't know who decides these things but doubt that it's mystery lovers like me.  It is probably the quality of the writing which is quite moving at times and the very involved plot that garnered the awards.  Hopefully it's not Clare, the lead character who acts and speaks without thinking.  A minister ought to be reflective.  She accidentally learns one of the suspects has lied and instead of reporting it to the police, she rushes off to confront the suspect.  Later, she accidentally learns the identity of a victim's boyfriend and rushes off to confront his parents, again without reporting the information to the police, this time because she's angry at the police chief because he quite naturally had  gotten  a search warrant for the earlier suspect's vehicle.  These are minor idiocies that escalate as the book goes on.  She opens her mouth and puts another victim in jeopardy, then endangers herself to rescue the victim.  I'll skip the details in case you happen to like these kinds of perils of Pauline stories.  Clare is also incredibly naive on the personal front.  She's always riding around with the police chief, has dinner at his home when his wife is away, has him to dinner at the rectory, then is surprised there's gossip.  What?  She forgot she was a woman long before she became a minister.<br /><br />It is particularly galling to me that these kinds of stupid heroines are so often written by women.<br /><br />I'll pass on any future tales of the perils of Clare.	2005-06-12

The first, \\"The Headacre Plot: is the weakest of the three although there are two murders committed with a unique weapon but because the story is told quickly the characters are not very defined.<br /><br />The second, \\"The Wander Bird Plot\\" is my favorite of the three.  The wander bird is an early version of a travel trailer in which a young woman is travelling around the Cape with her Uncle Wilber, a man who lost all his money in the stock crash, but he won the trailer in a cereal contest.  There are the usual colorful characters, the very wealthy widow, Nora Latimer, who has a young man protege each summer and Mrs. Lizzie Chatfield, an annual tourist, who loves to survey the views from her inn with her binoculars.  There's one murder with the ever popular blunt instrument, an arson to destroy evidence, and a second attempted murder, as well as a romance.  Asey takes charge, of course, and sorts it all out.<br /><br />The third story, \\"The Swan Boat Plot\\", is unique in that it takes place in Boston, rather than on the Cape -- the only Mayo story as far as I can remember, that isn't set on the Cape.<br /><br />Asey is picking Jenny up in Boston at 5:30 am as she returns from a family funeral in Chicago, but Jenny has mis-calculated the time difference and arrives early.  She goes into the Public Garden to feed the ducks and look at the Swan boats and witnesses the shooting of a photographer.  He's working early before the park gets crowded.  Jenny thinks his glamorous model has shot him and runs after her.  Asey follows a trial of Jenny's possessions, suitcase, pocketbook, hat, etc.  The model has a rich, jealous fiance, who objects to her possing.  There's the former model, now secretary to the photographer, who's in love with the model's brother, and a retired judge who used to have a summer place on the Cape and gave it up.  This story has many red herrings, two victims and complex situations, so it is not as relaxing a read as the earlier two.  I think it may have been written later because when Asey wraps it up, he has to return to the Porter factory which is starting to construct big tanks.  None-the-less, you can't beat three good stories for the price of one.ot as relaxing a read as the earlier two.

I recently finished this book and want to recommend it to all who enjoy traditional cozy mysteries.<br /><br />It was great.  I liked everything about it.  I was a bit leery in the first few pages cause I didn't want a ghost story, but that soon faded and I got engrossed in the plot and characters, etc.  I like the old houses - live in one built one that was built in 1863 - so that was a great part of the book for me.  And as with Shadows at the Fair, I enjoy the little print descriptions at the top of each chapter.<br /><br />Maggie goes to ME to visit an old college friend who, with her husband, has abandoned life in NYC for a an old house on the coast of ME.  Amy is intrigued by the history of the house they've bought and hopes to have a family there.  She's already fixed up a room as a nursery.<br /><br />Soon Will, an antiqueing friend of Maggie's, meets her.  All of his ancestors are from ME and he's there visiting an elderly aunt.  Maggie tells him about the weird experiences Amy is having in her old house, a baby crying in the night, minor accidents, etc.  Then the young girl, who has been working for Amy,  is found dead in a field behind the house and Maggie can't help but think about it, maybe ask a few questions, etc.<br /><br />Altogether, an excellent read.	2005-06-01

Asey Mayo is back on Cape Cod waiting out a strike at the Porter (auto) plant.  His old friend, Doc Cummings comes along and wants Asey to help him meet Carolyn Barton Boone, a glamourous activist who is President of a college.  She's in the area with a bunch of students doing a study of small towns.  Asey agrees when he's called upon to find a missing guest.  As always there are lots of interesting characters.  Some we get to know quite well.  There's Gerty, a beautiful ex-Wac and former showgirl.  There's an ex-Wave, a couple of young men, one who's very smart and another who was much decorated in the military.  There's Miss Shearing who actually runs the college while Mrs. Boone gathers the attention of the public.  And there are the locals, including a couple who write a popular radio soap opera and old Silvester, who lives in a shack in the woods.  The first victim is Mrs. Boone, but no one knows she's dead except Asey, the Doc and the murderer because the body was hidden.  Further along in the story there's another victim.  Asey manages to have it sorted out by the time the bodies are found.  Much of the dialogue is very funny.  I'm an avid reader of all these books and think if you'd give them a try, you might have as much fun reading them as I do.  The punch of the title is a paper punch, not a blow or the stuff you drink.	2005-06-01

He arrives to a bake sale going on at his house to raise money to repair destruction wrecked upon the Cape by a recent hurricane.<br /><br />Jenny, his cousin-housekeeper, sends him off to wander in the woods dressed in the business suit he was wearing to travel.  He finds the body of a well-dressed young woman who turns out to be the daughter of a former enemy.  Other people are about, sorting through the debris left by the storm.  He chases someone, is chased himself and gets thrown into a muddy swamp. He even becomes the primary murder suspect.  Soon he's cleared and free to detect by talking to the characters that people these books, a bitter writer, a love-lorn ex-Wac, a grouchy old lady, even a chubby eleven year old girl named Mildred, who all lead to the murder's solution.  Oh, and he also had to contend with a sharp-clawed Siamese named Zanies.  Shorter than most Atwood Taylor books (189 pgs), it makes a fun read for an evening's entertainment.	2005-05-27

The story opens with Asey's housekeeper-cousin upset with him because he allowed his photo to be taken for the cover of the NEWSORGAN magazine wearing his old clothes.  The set-to is interrupted by the arrival of a friend in an antique Porter car that Asey had a lot to do with perfecting years before.<br /><br />The next morning this friend, Bart Paget, is found dead of a clawing.  There's a wealthy young widow who keeps a pair of lynx cats as pets -- Smith and Wesson are their names and someone has let them out of their cage.<br /><br />Asey sets about investigating and sorthing out a bunch of characters that include a flighty, impetious neighbor, her ex-Navy son and a live-in friend who is a fortune teller.  There's a one armed man who's obsessive about his small golf course, a sunken ship that has re-surfaced in a recent storm and a pretty young woman who knows too much and becomes the second victim.<br /><br />There's suspense, but it's not intense.  There are murders, but they are not graphically violent, there old-fashioned detecting such as you'd find in an Agatha Christie book and there's humor.  I often find myself chuckling at the antics of the characters in these mysteries.  This is a good one and one of my favorites.	2005-05-24

This book is also set in the early 40's but the war activities seem to have become routine, so the story could be told in a manner similar to Atwood Taylor's earlier works with their amusing portrayals of Cape Cod characters.<br /><br />Asey is on vacation from tank manufacturing and is sorting fish line when cousin and housekeeper Jenny gets him to take her to an estate auction.  Leaving her there, he goes off fishing, but when he gets home he's asked to open a trunk bought at the auction by one of the heirs.  It contains the body of a local antique dealer who had failed to attend the auction.  We're off with Asey wandering around, talking to a raft of auction goers, getting biffed on the head and left tied up, etc.  The big questions are what happened to the money the estate owner kept in his house and what happened to the books that had been in the trunk before it was used to hide the body.  The dead woman had been on the rations board so there were folks with a motive related to that as well as to the missing money and the antique business.  As always, Asey cleverly sorts it out -- A recommended mystery from the classic era.	2005-05-21

He gets a two day vacation and comes home to Cape Cod and a mulititude of changes.  There's a mob in his house having First Aid lessons, the women are all wearing slacks including his cousin Jenny who doesn't have the figure for them.<br /><br />Once they all depart and he gets inside, he finds a body in his buttery.  The victim, a man who is not in the military because of a heart condition, has been bashed with an iron frypan, the spider of the title.  All of the suspects have bought one of these spiders as a birthday gift for the victim.<br /><br />As with all of Atwood Taylor's mysteries, it's a good story with clues and complications but because she is using life as it was at the time as part of her plot, the story is more frantic, faster-paced and the characters don't have the depth of those in the earlier works.<br /><br />My parents mentioned food & gas rationing and shortages of that period, but they never participated in all the war related activities of this book, the practicing for disasters, bandage making, Red Cross work or spotting.  It was never clear to me if it was ships or planes that they were trying to spot.  So possibly that was exaggerated for the story, or maybe it really was like that on Cape Cod.  In any event, it made for lots of complications for Asey's detecting and a lively read for me sixty years later.	2005-05-19

Then he wants to know why.  It's early 1940's war time, the women are organizing themselves into the Women's League to Defend America at all Costs with Action.  Asey, of course, opposes the whole idea of women running around with firearms and tells them to return the assorted weapons that they've gathered.  But then, he's shot at as he heads off to the Yacht Club and once there, he finds a woman guest has been poisoned.  She'd called and wanted to talk to him too.  He's off detecting with some help from a reporter and his pretty young illustrator AND the local housewives with their guns.  They've decided he might be doing defense work and needs protection.  Sometimes their efforts are rather ineffective, such as when one of these gals with a gun doesn't recognize him, but other times they prove to be a Godsend.  There are bits here and there that are laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />Everyone is obsessed with listening to the radio for war news, there's a second poisoning, but as always Asey manages to sort it all out and even relents about women bearing arms.<br /><br />Not Atwood Taylor at her very best, but still an entertaining read.	2005-05-18

(Asey Mayo Cape Cod Mysteries)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Asey Goes It Alone	While I've never yet read an Atwood Taylor that I'd give less than 5 stars, this is one of my least favorites.  Usually Asey has a quasi-Watston who is a middle-aged woman than accompanies him on his detecting, asks questions, and listens to his ideas.  Most of the women in these stories are portrayed as sensible, even courageous.  The story is also often told from their point of view.<br /><br />In this book, the opening introduces a spoiled little rich girl who Asey nearly runs over.  She's known for playing tricks, so he hardly believes her when she claims to have stumbled on a corpse.<br /><br />Her mother is a woman who \\"takes up\\" a new interest from time to time and now she's taken up politics to the point of spending so much time with a younger politician that it has caused gossip.  Minor female characters are Jenny, Asey's housekeeper and an aunt of the first victim.<br /><br />Aside from no admirable women, it's still a good mystery with a first victim to wonder about within the first few pages.  The body is later delivered to the Dr. as a large C.O.D. package wrapped in dry ice.<br /><br />With some minor help from cousin Syd, Asey investigates on his own, even gets knocked on the head with a fry pan.  And, of course, he figures it all out and exposes a surprise perpetrator at the end.  I recommend this book for it's credible mystery.	2005-05-17

If you've never read one, the setting is Cape Cod, MA.  The detective is an area native with diverse experience, a sailor, a cook, a master mechanic, etc.  He's referred to as a hayseed because he's usually dressed in old corduroy trousers and flannel shirts.  His age is never given beyond saying he's somewhere between 45 and 60.<br /><br />In the earlier books, the story is told in the first person through the eyes of an older woman who accompanies Asey on the investigation.  In this one it is Penelope Colton.  The time is the 30's.  The stock market has crashed and this woman is reduced to clerking in a department store, but a friend has invited her to summer at her house called Sandbar.  Once there, she gets drafted into acting as housekeeper and the house is soon full of family and guests -- lots of suspects when there are two murders on the same night.  Asey and Pen find the body of a young man in the boathouse and the body of the home owner buried in sand on the beach.<br /><br />Of course, there are no TV's, PC's, cell phones, etc. but I don't find their absence jarring because the mysteries are so well plotted.  I am seldom able to figure out \\"who did it\\" before Asey wraps it up at the end.  I do have to remind myself that in the 30's life expectancy wasn't as long so a woman in her 50's was considered older than she would be today.<br /><br />Also, the author was turning out these great mysteries one after another at a young age, (25 when she wrote this one,) so her perception of age would have been affected by her youth.<br /><br />I recommend this book and all of Taylor's work - great pure old-fashioned mystery.	2005-05-09

I read the first book in this series, \\"Roots of Murder\\" and enjoyed it.  I missed the next two, then happened on this one. I expected to enjoy it as much as the first but was very disappointed by the amount of violence in it.  Also, the author increased the level of suspense higher than I prefer.  Our heroine was run off the road, seriously injuring her romantic interest (who did that?  We're never told).  Her car was vandalized, a woman was gruesomely stranged, another was blown up, there was arson -- far too much mayhem for a traditional cozy and as that's the type of book I prefer, this was not for me.	2005-03-25

The premise that a modern college president would expect a teacher to renounce witchcraft because her late husband's ancestor was hung as a witch is 1692 is tenuous.<br /><br />The disappointing aspects are that the killer is so sketchily referred to in the beginning of the book that when the revelation comes at the end, the reader is thinking, `who's that?'<br /><br />Both the dust jacket and amazon's description referred to Sally's fellow teacher, Jack, as her lover, so I kept watching for Jack to break up with Vera, and realize he was still interested in Sally.  It never happened.  While it would enhance my reading pleasure if this amateur female protagonist had a romantic interest, the bad part of her not having one was that she had no backup when she inevitably found herself in the usual `perils of Pauline' situation.<br /><br />Henceforth, I'll stick with Bill Crider's excellent Sheriff Dan Knowles series with it's colorful and dependable folks in Clearview, TX.	2005-03-13

One of her issues is that she's agreed to be bridesmaid for a friend, Jeanine, on the same weekend that she's playing golf in a tournament with her father, who left her mother for another woman when she was young, and her boyfriend who she's not getting along with very well.<br /><br />The first 40 to 50 pages are rough going because we are bombarded with characters, the bride to be, her family including a lecherous father and a bossy aunt, the fiance's family, Cassie's own family, father, step-mother and stepbrothers.  It was difficult to keep track of who was who, and I almost gave up, but was glad I didn't because then there was an accidental death, the bride's father disappeared, an enemy of his got shot at a wacky bridal shower where the guests were required to wear costumes, and Cassie got picked up for drunk driving after a beer and a half, by an over-zealous woman cop.  The book became a page-turner that I could not put down.<br /><br />Cassie did find herself in danger a couple of times, but it wasn't caused by her own stupidity. I especially liked that and that she always had the help of two dependable cohorts, Laura, a friend and caddy, and Joe, a sports psychologist.<br /><br />As neither a player nor a viewer of golf, the tournament setting was not a problem, but might be an enhancement for golfing fans.  There is a handy glossary at the end to help with unfamiliar golf terms, such as yips, one I did look up.	2005-03-07

We learn early on of the death of her fellow teacher, Patsy Steinberg, who drowned in the school swimming pool nearly a year ago.<br /><br />Margo's Watson is the zany Roxy who is \\"into\\" genealogy and learns that one of her great-grandmothers was a Cherokee Indian.  She provides comic relief by becoming a generic American Indian, freely borrowing from any tribe's traditions.<br /><br />While shopping after Thanksgiving, Margo meets Patsy Steinberg's husband.  He thinks his wife's death was murder and Margo agrees to look into it.  She and Roxy are know to have solved some prior crimes.<br /><br />This author's strength is descriptive narrative and so we are treated to lavish accounts of the ordinary events of Margo's life, the preparation of special foods for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.  I was particularly impressed by the descriptions of nature, such as the effects of cold and snow on the landscape.<br /><br />Interspersed with these accounts are spurts of investigation.  Margo learns there was another death a year prior to Patsy's that was attributed to suicide.  That teacher's widow does not believe he was suicidal and also suspects he may have been murdered.<br /><br />It is in the last quarter of the book that serious sleuthing takes place when Margo and Roxy (who now calls herself Dancing Moon) realize there is the possibility that another murder will occur.<br /><br />This book would not please the hardcore mystery buff who wants total emphasis on crime and suspense, but I can and do recommend it to any reader who enjoys the bonus of an entertaining picture of life in another place along with their mystery.	2004-12-03

Having read and enjoyed all the earlier books in this series, I expected to enjoy this one too.  But Ms. Swanson has upped the level of everything in this latest book.  We're told more than we need to know about Skye Denison's lovelife with her bland boyfriend, Simon, who no longer even worries about her tendency to place herself in danger.  And the number of acts of violence in 250 pgs. are mind boggling.  Skye's brother is battered several times.  A musician is killed, the school is set on fire.  A student is shut up in a locker, another has to be taken from the school's roof before he jumps, Skye's car is run off the road, a woman is shot dead, and most annoying of all, Skye keeps stupidly putting herself in jeopardy by going off on her own to investigate such things as methamphetamine labs without anyone knowing where she's going.  All this in a town of only a few thousand citizens.  It's all too much.  I won't rush out to get the next installment.	2004-11-27

I've no desire to become a collaborative writer, but read it out of curiousity, to learn how writing a book, something I've always thought of as a singular activity, could be done by two people.<br /><br />The authors don't just relay their own experiences as a husband and wife team, but have included many other team's experiences, teams that consist of sisters, other couples, friends, even a mother & daughter team.<br /><br />They discuss finding the right partner and everything that comes after, division of work, settling disputes, contracts, etc.<br /><br />There is a tremendous amount of information that is useful to any aspiring writer, a sort of quiz of required talents and a realistic, hard look at the difficulties involved in getting published and achieving success.  This is something that is glossed over in most books on writing.  It is unique to find this aspect of the writing life spelled out as it is here.	2004-11-21

The writing is fine, the characters are fascinating and so well defined that you can understand them even if you've never personally known anyone like them.

This is a really fine book, a rarity in that it is a small town police procedural.  The kind of story the Brits do well, but most American police procedurals are set in big cities like LA or NYC, and are much grittier.<br /><br />There is a twenty-five year reunion of the class of `69 in Mellingham, MA.  The story starts off slowly as we meet both returning students and the ones who've remained in Mellingham.  It was a bit hard to keep track of so many characters at the beginning but once the first event of the reunion started at around page 50, I was caught up in their lives and what intricate lives they had.  Becka, an attractive woman was once married to Richard, one member of the class, is now married to Hugh, another member of the class, and is being hit on by Vic, her neighbor and a former lover.  She's the mother of a son by Richard.  The two husbands and the neighbor are all involved in the same paper manufacturing business.<br /><br />Another classmate, Elliot, has returned in search of the secret of what really happened that caused the disintegration of his family twenty-six years ago.<br /><br />There are many interesting supporting characters too - the proprietors of the inn and bar where events are held, and Polly, the class secretary who persistently organizes everything.<br /><br />Vic is sent home early in a taxi after creating a disturbance on the first evening of the reunion.  In the morning, Becka finds him in a coma on his dining room floor and his wife no where to be found.<br /><br />And, of course, from the first event on, we have Police Chief Joe Silva questioning and analyzing the behavior and emotions of the classmates.  He was at the first event because he is dating a member of the class.  Silva is an admirable protagonist, intelligent and compassionate, and by doggedly gathering evidence and talking to everyone, he clears up all of the mysteries, Elliot's past, the missing wife and Vic's coma.<br /><br />A truly satisfying read that I recommend to all mystery lovers..	2004-11-03

I'm not going to waste words describing this book's plot as that has been ably done by earlier reviewers.<br /><br />The story grabbed me from the beginning.  Grace is a likeable protagonist.  The descriptions of the Lake District, fox hunting, the beleaguered play, are all fine and funny.  Something new kept happening that kept me reading far into the night.<br /><br />But then, about 2/3rds of the way through the book, when Grace is asked to meet one of the suspects in the deserted theater, she tells herself that it's \\"not only dumb, it's cliched.\\"  Nevertheless, from that point on, she behaves like a stupid school girl rather than a literary scholar, and walks into danger repeatedly.  (Amateur female detectives who do this are a constant irritation to me and many other mystery lovers of my acquaintance).<br /><br />The story's ending was a disappointment.  It's never made clear why Peter hied off to the thieves' lair.  But he's a mysterious man who never explained anything so that might be overlooked.  However, while no one got away with murder, one villain did seem to be depicted as special and did, unfortunately, escape justice.<br /><br />I gave this story five stars because, in spite of my dislike of the ending, it has great readability and there was no point at which I even considered not finishing it.	2004-10-19

The beginning is confusing because there seem to be too many characters to keep track of.  Then the presence of jazz age celebrities would slow me down.  I was not alive during the 20's, the setting of this book, but many of the real people put in as characters were still alive when I was young, Millay, O'Keefe, Picasso, Hemingway, etc.  Each time one of these characters appeared it would make me pause and remember hearing about them in the past.  Reading about a fictional character who is mentally disturbed is altogether different than reading about a character who was, in real life, a disturbed woman (Zelda Fitzgerald).  3/4 of the book was searching for a missing person - it wasn't until the last 1/4 that we learned of the murder and read its ultimate solution.  The writing is good and younger readers might find the book more gripping than I did.	2004-10-09

Susan Lombardi is a professor at a Connecticut university who used to teach at an exclusive private girl's school.  She left Wintonbury Academy and moved on to the university because of conflicts with the school's headmistress, Sabena Lazlo, the murder victim.<br /><br />We learn about her death on the very first page of the book.  Susan is appalled because a good friend, John deHavilland, who still teaches at Wintonbury, is the primary suspect.  She decides to look into the crime to see if she can clear John.  While following her investigation we're introduced to an interesting cast of characters, her best friend, Elaine, Swash, her likeable husband, Mark, a former adult student with a P.I. license, as well as numerous instructors and students at the girl's school.  There is a sub-plot involving a conflict with a  manipulative professor at the university, etc.<br /><br />The story is told exclusively through Susan's point of view, which helps us to identify with her.  The descriptions of the characters are good, enabling the reader to \\"see\\" them in the mind's eye. The quotes that introduce each short chapter are fun, and the whole thing comes to a very satisfactory conclusion in the last couple of chapters.  My only complaint is that I would have liked more story, a bit longer would have been great.	2004-09-30

This one was a disappointment.  The story started off interestingly enough with a hospital setting and Aunt Julia having to be taken there because of a heart attack.  Julia is an interesting and likeable character who has appeared in many of the earlier books.  But then the story started to drag -- there'd be long sections with no plot progress, and the relationship between Sarah and her doctor husband, Alex, was nearly non existant or strained, unlike in prior books where they frequently worked together.  It was fairly obvious who the villians were a good hundred pages before the end, so a very slow finish.  I won't abandon Borthwick because she's a fine writer, will just hope her next book measures up to the earlier ones.	2004-09-22

It's about Stoney, a man who's lost his memory, they said.  Yes, but not completely.  He remembers bits, here and there, but cannot connect them, and he seems to have acquired some psychic abilities.  He has a woman who loves him, they said.  Yes, but it's no ordinary romance.  Kate is an unusual woman who is encumbered with a husband who has MS and she loves Stoney on her own terms.<br /><br />I was emotionally drawn into Stoney's life.  Any story told from a single point of view does this best.<br /><br />I grieved along with Stoney when Lyle was murdered.  He was Stoney's first real friend since he'd come to Maine and a likable character.<br /><br />Stoney learns about himself as he investigates his friend's murder and there are things about himself that he just is, without questioning why he is.  For instance, he won't become Kate's lover without her husband's permission.  So, he has some standards of morality.  And he has a sense of humor.  While there's not much that's amusing in this story, Stoney's \\"conversations\\" with Ralph always made me smile.<br /><br />The Maine setting and people are accurately portrayed.<br /><br />There was one tiny aspect of the ending that strained my credulity but overall it was satisfactory.<br /><br />I have questions.  There are things about these people that I want to know.  I will welcome a sequel with enthusiasm.	2004-09-15

This books starts off funny, drew me right into the story.  I kept watching for a major crime (murder) but there wasn't one.  One of the book's characters said the worst mysteries are when there's a murder right off.  I totally disagree with him.  I didn't recognize it as a forwarning but it wasn't long after that that I noticed the cover of the book said \\"novel\\", not mystery.  But by then I was engrossed in Nick's problems and read on through the night to the end, which was a little disappointing.  I notice there are many reviews here by people posting their first and only review.  This suggests that whether they did or did not like the book, they too, felt compelled to keep reading to the end, just as I did.	2004-08-25

The provost, Merry Ginka, appoints the least likely candidate chairman of the department, bypassing the usual election process.  Peter deJonge, a graduate student, has asked Nick to do some \\"detecting\\" for him.  Nick is thinking about that and he's thinking about whether or not he might be bisexual, as he keeps finding himself susceptible to the attractions of Juno, a flamboyant professor in his department.<br /><br />Stefen, Nick's pardner, had been planning for them to have a tropical vacation for spring break in March, but decides they need one now and off they go to a Club Med on Serenity, a fictional Carribbean island.<br /><br />One of the first people to approach Nick on the beach is deJong, the graduate student.  He'd learned from Stefan where they were going and had brought his problem with him.  Oh, and there are intrigues among the Club Med staff and one of the fellow guests is a hot new writer that Stefen hates and probably envies.  There are other colorful characters and eventually a murder.<br /><br />This, as with the last couple of these Nick Hoffman mysteries, is not a typical murder mystery.  It breaks most of the traditions of the genre, the major crime occurs far into the story, the perpetrator is often a surprise and the reader is seldom given enough clues to figure it out for him or herself.<br /><br />But the book is a stimulating read, very erudite.  I usually have an English and a French dictionary hardy.  The quotes sprinkled throughout are thought provoking.  And a good deal of it is funny, the kind of sauciness that makes me chuckle outloud, all by myself.  I recommend this book.	2004-08-19

The whole bit about the editor's visit to Washington, the despressing discriptions of the government's treatment of the bonus marchers (some of them children) may appeal to history buffs, but had little to do with the crimes in upstate NY.  Also the editor's involvement with one of the marchers,a young mother with two children had nothing at all to do with the murders.  She was there in a wagon with a mule.  I vaguely wondered about the historical accuracy of that.  Would there be a mule pulled wagon on the highways between DC and NY in the 30's?  But no matter - it was filler.  I read another in this series earlier, In the Still of the Night, and enjoyed it, but will not seek out any more of them.	2004-08-07

I read a couple of the other books in this series before this one, and if I could start over, I'd read this one first. The later ones stand alone well enough, but this story presents some background for the later ones. Having read this book, I now have a better understanding of the later ones.

First off, we have a body on page 18.  Die-hard mystery lovers notice this. Christie could open with a body, but modern writers often don't introduce the victim until half way through the book.<br /><br />Nick, the protagonist, is upset about the death of a  former student and from time to time, asks questions, talks to people who might know something. Stefen, his pardner, advices leaving it to the police.  In between, we have fun peeking into the lives of these academic types.  They cook gourmet meals together, drink exotic and expensive wines and whiskies, listen to classical music, watch old movies and ogle the yard boy working in the neighbor's yard.  That handsome yard boy, who is student of the professor whose yard he's mowing, soon insulates himself into Nick's life, maneuvering to be his teaching assistant and flattering him.  Stefen seems jealous.  There are women associates storming around and behaving erratically.  There are no nice women in this mystery, with the exception of a cameo by Stefan's step-mother, Minnie, a sweet Jewish mama type who handles her husband well, by ignoring him.  So, anyway, the reader gets interested in what they are doing about the death of the student and how they are relating to each other and their associates and soon you're caught up in the whole thing and can't put it down, until the neat ending when everyone gets what they deserve - maybe.	2004-08-05

I've never been to TX or Mexico but these novels make me feel like I have.  This book has an involved plot that is eventually all connected and sorted out.  The reader is not left with any loose ends.  The characters are interesting and charming.  Texana's husband is a vet, so there are even interesting animal characters.  I particularly enjoy Phoebe, their pet bobcat who lives in the trading post with them. While some horrible things happen, we are not given such graphic details as to give nightmares.

Naturally I expected it was a mystery with murders in the title, but reading it felt like I'd stumbled into a literary novel about writer's Angst.  One writer was so obnoxiously obsessed with jealousy and envy that I immediately rooted for her to be perpetrator or victim.  A bit over 1/3 of the way into the book, there was a murder and the story evolved into a proper mystery with the appearance of a traditional character, a likeable cop, Lt. Valley, and later, Angie, a criminal justice student who helped with the detecting.  Nick's pardner, Stefan, is the practical down-to-earth one.  The relationship reminded me of Hall's Stanley Hastings and his wife, Alice.  Alice brings Stanley down to earth from time to time, too.  Thankfully, there are no details of the men's intimate relations which is as it should be.  The largest number of consumers of mysteries are mature women (like me) and the majority of them abhor sex scenes, be they hetero or homo. The book's ending was a very satisfactory wrap-up.<br /><br />As to Wharton, she serves as catalyst for the gathering, but we are not bombarded with biographical data.  If you want more, read a biography, and if you come to southern New England, visit The Mount, Edith's beautiful home in Lenox, MA.	2004-07-30

Lillian's Watson, Tess, of the bad feet, is clever, practical and a true friend.  There's even a sub-plot of a romance between Lillian's granddaughter and a bartender/student.

I like these books because I'm a lifelong Sherlock Holmes fan and this one featured Holmes from the beginning in an absorbing story in which he was impersonated, traveled from England, to NYC and and then to Chicago and even was involved in a bit of a romance.  Rafferty and other characters from previous books made appearances in an auxillary capacity, which suits me fine.<br />Mr. Millett's ability to capture the voice of Watson (as created by Doyle) is the most appealing aspect of this tale.	2004-07-03

I loved the 1st 3 books of this series and highly recommend them.  In those books, Mr. Millett captured the &quot;real&quot; voice of Dr. Watson (as created by Doyle.)  This book is all over the place with different points of view -- a street person who catches rats, Shadwell Rafferty, an axiliary character, the author and when we hear about Holmes it's in the awful form of journal entries with initials and ampersands that slow the reading. I intent to try again to finish the book, but think I'll find the next one at the library rather than buying it as I did the first 4, just in case Millett has truly abandoned Holmes in favor of Raffety and is tired of writing in that beloved voice that he was clever enough to re-create when he chose to.	2004-06-20

A constable's wife overheard two  bank clerks talking in a queue at the supermarket about Miss Wansdyke's  dying with a quarter of a million pounds in the bank.  This is brought to  Inspector Sloan's attention and starts the investigation.  Where did she  get it? She lived modestly.  And Sloan's rather hapless Constable Crosby  was acquainted with Miss Wansdyke because she'd very recently come to him  about her missing dog.  The story is well plotted, very absorbing and  entertaining. Inspector Sloan, about to become a father in this book, is  one of the more likeable of the British police Inspectors.  British cozies  are a great favorite of mine and Catherine Aird is a master of this genre.  This one is a gem!	2000-05-11

Harold Medburn, headmaster of the village school, is found dead in the schoolyard on the night of a Halloween party.  The police accuse his wife Kitty of killing her husband because he  was about to leave her.  The school's caretaker loved Kitty when they were  young and wants to help her.  He sets his daughter to asking questions.  No  one is sorry Harold is dead, he'd been a bully who took pleasure in  tormenting his staff, even some parents.  So the emphasis is not so much on  solving his murder as exonerating Kitty.  Insp. Ramsey, who usually has a  more effective role in Cleeves' mysteries, is almost a secondary character  in this one.  But the portrayals of the townspeople are well drawn and I  enjoyed the story for that and the murder was solved in a surprising  fashion in the end.	2000-05-11
