Furthermore war releases the work of compassion and love for the needy which breaks through all barriers of naturally given groups, and it does this as a mass phenomenon.  Religion, from its side, can only in general provide a similar ethic of brotherliness in the heroic-warrior communities.  And furthermore war performs something for the combatant himself that is quite distinctive in his sensibility: the perception of the meaning and consecration of death, which belongs to him alone.  The community of the standing army in the field is today aware of itself as a community until death, the greatest of its kind - just as in the times of the warrior bands. . . Death in arms, only here in this massiveness of death, can the individual believe he knows that he dies `for' something.\\" <br /> <br />Max Weber, Intermediate Reflection, ca 1916 <br /> <br />Few would believe in such sentiments today.  Weber himself did not look at the war the same way two years later, although his quoted comments were meant to describe the \\"meaning\\" individuals placed in war, as members of a political community of destiny, comparing it with religious sentiments. <br /> <br />William Pfaff's The Bullet's Song is arguably his best book.  Here he takes a subjective look at the great crisis or complexus of crises that arose with the First World War.  With the chivalric moral values that underpinned Western Liberalism destroyed by the war, a vacuum resulted that had to be replaced with something.  Unfortunately for humanity that something was a series of militant and irrational utopianisms that have led to an unprecedented series of man-made global disasters.  As Pfaff implies we are not at the end of this tendency, might actually be in the grips of the last and potentially most powerful of these secular replacements for God.  \\"The enemy is identified as a metaphysical or spiritual reality. . . This marks an advance of American political thought toward the darkness of totalitarian conceptions and discourse, translating human conflict into metaphysical combat.\\"  Page 309.  Also \\"it is easy to conceive of the future in Hobbesian terms of totally self-interested power struggles, however disguised these may be in the rhetoric of liberalism\\".  Page 307.  And finally \\"It is essential to recognize the possibility that the disordered and morally catastrophic century in which the persons in my book lived might represent our future and not only our past.\\"  Page 319. <br /> <br />Pfaff looks at these utopian ideas from the perspectives of seven main biographies of men who were caught up in the confusion and promise of their times and attempted to resolve their sense of chivalry with the confusing and massive violence around them.  All came up short and some ended up turning on the very ideals they had suffered so much to fulfil.  In the end all the main characters arrived at a certain clarity of what their actions had achieved or failed to achieve or had unintentionally achieved.  They had got beyond their own ideals/ideology and realized their distinctly human limitations, or perhaps the (un)avoidable tragedy, farce and chance of human experience? <br /> <br />This is no minor issue today in a time of schizophrenic public debate/information available,  which relies on endless and ambiguous assumption .  You are suppose to \\"just know\\" which way to go, whom to follow.  But it never really works out that way.  <br /> <br />Instead, we always struggle with a compromise of irreconcilable values - which is the curse of modern times.  Somebody always gets screwed over - either your parents, or your kids, or your spouse, or yourself.  Endless value conflicts in a war of opposing \\"gods\\" who fight on in dis-enchanted form as obscure interests.  Whereas before there was only the absolute ethic, there is in modernity a variety of warring value \\"spheres\\" - Weber defined modernity in terms of the conflict in values interacting with modern social processes.  What Pfaff really seems to lament is the loss of this absolute ethic, what Medieval Christianity for example promised and for generations many believed . . .  His appeal seems to me that of a modern follower of Thomas Aquinus, someone looking for a synthesis of reason and faith, which is unfortunately not possible in the modern West.  Or is he more in the line of the stoics and Marcus Aurelius, actually appealing to a pre-Christian ethic?   <br /> <br />In any case, as Nietzsche indicated, it was not the end of chivalry as a value set, but the end of the absolute ethic that Christianity once supplied that was the crisis facing the West.  The lack of that absolute ethic, transcending all other values - what after all could compete with serving the Lord and safeguarding one's own everlasting soul? - has been replaced by a return to \\"polytheism\\" as Weber described.  This of course pre-dated 1914, so what was the effect of the war?  The war acted as a catalyst, quickening the pace of change, challenging the old values and notions which did not survive this \\"hammer\\".  Nietzsche said that new values were necessary and that we as individuals would have to choose them.  Few are up to such a challenge, even today, so the tendency is to find a replacement for the lost absolute ethic in political ideology or retreat and attempt a \\"re-enchantment\\" of religion or other traditional dogma.  <br /> <br />This is where Pfaff's ideal falls short imo, since it requires a rather extensive \\"surrender of the intellect\\", in effect repeating the same sort of commitment (this time a return to traditional Christianity or Christian-like stoicism) without questioning what might be the unintended results of those commitments.  Even a Marcus Aurelius was afterall the father of a Commodus.  In this way, Max Weber'sideal of the politician balancing the ethic of responsibility with that of conviction, yet being conscious of the historical processes and tragic outcomes that befall human endeavour, is more intellectually appealing than Pfaff's call for a re-enchantment of the lost Christianity of our great-grandparents.  Pfaff's idea of virtue is based on ascetic self-denial and sacrifice \\"to achieve perfection in the performance of something of no inherent utility\\" (page 311), but it was Nietzsche again in his influential 3rd Essay in The Genealogy of Morals that showed this ascetic ideal as the mother of science which leads us back to the confusion or debasement of all values, since as in his example of Ernst Jnger's focused and scientific study of beetles, even science can have no \\"inherent utility\\". <br /> <br />Still the journey that William Pfaff takes you on to reach his conclusions is an impressively insightful view of the 20th Century and the sanguinary ideologies that caused it to destroy much of the tottering moral universe that had existed at its beginning.  He knows his history, especially of the struggle against Communism and his description of Willi Mnzenberg and the Comintern provides much that makes some of the current methods of mass persuasion comprehensible.  Contrary to those who think that recent actions of groups to undermine the legitimacy of the state is something new (referred to often as 4th Generation Warfare), Pfaff shows that it was in reality Soviet policy from the 1920's on.  It all comes down to how one defines the state. <br /> <br />This brings up another important question that Pfaff never asks.  If the attitude as expressed in the Weber quote no longer expresses Western attitudes towards war, how come it does in fact express the attitudes of many in the world today, those political communities fighting for what they consider their very existence?  I suspect that a fighter in the current Iraqi resistance, or among the Palestinians of the West Bank, would find Weber's view of 1916 obviously correct.   <br /> <br />Here, I mention America since it is only in America, only here in the West, where anything approaching the old chivalric ethic still survives.  Who in America joins the military with the idea that they would welcome a hero's death?  That their death would have special meaning for the entire community that they represent?  That's not really it, is it?  Does not in fact every volunteer join with the idea that he or she will undoubtedly survive and experience old age, with grandchildren on their knee, telling of their service for the great cause?  It is more the trappings of the old ethic that attracts us, discounting the materialist incentives, the shards of the old ethos, not the moral ideal - the real essence - that attracts us.  When the reality intrudes we react bitterly - \\"how could such a thing happen?\\" <br /> <br />Should we lament this fact?  It is in fact only in the West, and in Japan, India, South Africa, much of South America. . . where we have nothing left to fight and die for. Our societies are either prosperous and powerful, or we are not willing to take a violent alternative due to historical experience.  Beyond attack in most senses, even the \\"threats\\" more the nature of \\"blowback\\" of our own failed Western policies, better dealt with as a police matter.  Obviously a war for oil would never command the same sort of devotion or commitment, which is why our current war(s) have to be packaged with compelling masks. . .   <br />This is all within Pfaff's argument, which makes it a powerful one.  One which would <br />allow humanity to focus on the real dangers at hand.  We need not fear each other, but rather need to address questions concerning our environmental survival, not a moral question at all since it does not involve a choice. <br /> <br />One last comment: Pfaff seems to misread Leo Strauss (page 307) since Strauss rejects Natural Law - divine or otherwise - and argues Natural Right (see Natural Right and History vii). Strauss's view is that the rational can achieve objectivity and can create objective theory on which to base social/political policy.  It is in reality, yet another utopian fantasy as we see today with those who have convinced themselves that when they act they create their own reality, are history's unquestioned actors.  There is no misunderstanding of Strauss's message by his current followers, rather its deterministic conclusion, as in the conclusion of every other utopian fantasy that Pfaff describes.  <br /> <br />Finally, one should discount the Washington Post review provided here since the reviewer obviously misunderstands Pfaff's argument.  The civil rights movement was not utopian in the sense Pfaff uses the word, but a demand for justice, a democratic movement, contrary to the totalitarian utopias described in the book. <br />	2005-08-31

I would rate it at the same level of Michael Handel's Masters of War, but below Raymond Aron's Clausewitz and Uwe Hartmann's Carl von Clausewitz.    Professor Smith's work is well written and organized.  He presents not only Clausewitz's views but also those hoping to replace his paradigm of war which has been the dominate one for the last 200 years.  In addition I find his work to be far better in describing the current Global War on Terror, although that is not its main intention, than recent works by Colonel Hammes for example.  While Hammes loses himself in a maze of his own and others' reified concepts, Smith knows what strategic theory is, the natural tension between it and praxis and the danger of attempting to make the reality fit the subjective doctrinaire model and thus \\"falling short\\".    In fact On Clausewitz presents the tensions associated with Clausewitzian theory very well, with one exception.    First we have the tension between analysis and doctrine.  War does have a rational element, and that rational element ought to make war into an instrument of policy.  So analysis becomes when dealing with this rational element fused with doctrine.  The same is true concerning political - military relations, conflicts between which Smith sees as \\"a serious omission\\" since Clausewitz fails to discuss this (page 219).  He assumes that the state will treat war as a policy instrument and will not expect from war something outside its nature to achieve.  Yet this happens, as in Bush's plan to remake the Iraqi political identity into an American (and Israeli) friendly anti-traditional arab state with only a limited investment of military resources to carry it through.  I see this \\"omission\\" more the nature of a warning since the nature of war as political instrument remains, if one side loses control of the instrument it can mean that the other side gains control and thus uses the war to achieve its own policygoals.  Notice how this describes well the current situation in Iraq in regards to Iran and Iranian goals in Iraq. . .    Clausewitz remains silent as to what the military should do when the political leadership botches a war, but his own actions at Tauroggen in 1812 indicate his subjective response in this matter.  I think Clausewitz was unable to deal with this difficult situation in a theoretical manner, dealing with as it does personal values, which leaves each officer to find his own way should he find himself serving a strategically incompetent political leadership or a leadership which wages war for its own interests and not those of the nation it represents..    The next tension that Smith brings out beautifully is the tension between theory and praxis.  He goes through Clausewitz's Kritik methodology and introduces praxis as the third step where of course it belongs.  Theory for Clausewitz is used to understand history and in understanding current reality.  Clausewitz's theory is not a grand system of reality (this is where he is definitely not tied to Hegel, but actually anti-Hegelian) but a flexible and tension filled framework of concepts and principles used to sort out the important events from the unimportant.      The third tension I would mention is that associated with Clausewitz's concept of cohesion.  Cohesion acts as the force that keeps a state together, forms its center of gravity(ies) and forms the basis for its alliances.  A lack of state cohesion detracts from the advantages otherwise associated with being on the defense.  On the international level, states pursue policies equal to their own weight and cohesion.  The international balance of power is maintained by the cohesion of international relations and interests which tend towards equilibrium, to the detriment of a single state that attempts to gain power over all.  This  flexible concept is very applicable to the international situation today in the Middle East and elsewhere where mineral resources are becoming contested.  So cohesion works at all three levels - the tactical, the strategic (or operational) and that of war plans.      However it is this fourth and last tension I will mention where Smith's excellent book falls a bit short.  Had he been familiar with Hartmann's work (unfortunately not available in English) he would have been aware of the Schliermacher dialectic, or rather the three types of this dialectic that run all through On War. Instead, Smith mentions Clausewitz's thinking as \\"dualistic rather than genuinely dialectic\\" (page 61), since for him there is only the dialectic associated with Hegel that comes into question.  Rather as Hartmann, and indirectly Aron, have pointed out, Clausewitz.deals with conceptual pairs that exist in a sort of constant tension that is never resolved.  Instead of a synthesis, this version of Schliermacher's is a reverse dialectic which returns to the source of the conflict between the two types - thus the Weberian ideal types of Absolute and Real War when \\"reduced\\" reveal the \\"remarkable trinity\\" as the unifying and tension-causing element able to explain both.    This shortcoming does little to affect the overall worth of the book, is more the nature of a specialist's comment.    In all I recommend this book to all readers of On War and or those with an interest in cultivating an effective strategic analysis of the current the Global War on Terror.      Smith's work shows Clausewitz's applicability to the full spectrum of warfare, including Nuclear War (strangely similar to Clausewitz's concept of Absolute War) and what he describes as \\"Anti-Modern Warfare\\" or Guerrilla Warfare along with Terrorism.  Smith's comments at the end of this chapter are particularly useful in lifting the conceptual fog surrounding \\"Terrorism\\".  Although in connection with this latter type, I think retaining the Clausewitzian terms of Kleiner Krieg and \\"People's War\\" along with a discussion of Clausewitz's seminar of 1811would have been very useful.      Contrary to the current 4th Generation Warfare view of Mao as the father of this \\"art of warfare\\", as Smith shows, he must be placed in a larger context of revolutionary war which would include Lenin and the Comintern.  The connection between Clausewitz on the one side and Lenin and Mao on the other is clear and historically proven: Lenin having extensively commented on Clausewitz and Mao having read On War in translation in 1938.  Aron has detailed the entire connection between communist strategic thought and Clausewitz well in the work I mentioned above.    Hopefully this book will not only shed light on a complex subject for students of On War, but also for those followers of the currently popular anti-Clausewitzian faddish concepts which only achieve in clouding the waters ever more thoroughly.	2005-08-22

I give the book four stars.  If there were half-stars it would get three and half, which indicates more my evaluation. <br /> <br />First Kunstler writes well.  His ironic and biting humor at times made me want to laugh out loud which is not easy given the dank depression ouzing out of the book.  Let's face it the end of the cheap oil economy is going to change the world as we know it and with Matthew R. Simmon's book out now to provide the technical data behind the Saudi peak there is little reason to doubt that Hubbert's peak is now upon us. <br /> <br />Kunstler goes through the alternative energy sources as well, pretty much kicking the stands out from under the vaunted \\"hydrogen economy\\", tar sands and oil shale.  The Energy returned over energy invested (EroEI) does no compute.  Not to mention the additional costs of poisoned ground water - fresh water being the other rapidly depleting resource we need to worry about. <br /> <br />So the author does a fairly good job of thinking outside the box as far as the end of cheap oil goes and also harbors no illusions about Globalization (\\"primarily a way of privatizing the profits of business activity while socializing the costs\\").  His discriptions of what life could be like at mid-century are hair-raising. <br /> <br />The down side is that his clear realism and trashing of comfortable myths avoids a series of myths that he is very happy with leaving unquestioned.  The Global War on Terror being the main one with various others such as the de-contextualized \\"dark interstices of Arab politics\\", not to mention the war in Iraq.  That war was according to Kunstler, \\"strategically about setting up a police station in the middle of a very large bad neighborhood\\", or \\"a forward base to . . . moderate and influence behavior\\" and of course those WMD's, \\"since the UN team was prevented from completing the search, the US had to do it in person\\". <br /> <br />Kunstler has difficulty with military history as in a misleading comment about Stalingrad and does not do much better with the more recent history of the second Iraq war, going from use of dubious metaphors to a passive form that hides exactly who decided on war and why.  Iraq was a basket case, not even in control of its own airspace  in 2003 which is the reason we attacked.  As to the goals of that war the Oil Ministry was secured whereas the UN-sealed bunkers and atomic materials we knew of were not.  Instead of enough troops to secure the area and cost-efficently allowing the Iraqis to rebuild their own country, Bush let loose the dogs of shameless war profiteering and the chaos only spread.  This of course ignorring the fact that the presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia was one of the main reasons for the radicalization of that country's attitude toward the US.  The \\"accelerating mood of dark, bottomless fury\\" in the Muslim world is directly linked to our policies over the last twenty-five years and most recently to the ham-fisted cluelessness of George W. Bush.  One would think Kunstler, so eager to destroy the myths that blind America to its current dilemma would not stop short of tackling some of the biggest and most destructive ones.	2005-07-14

US	51104090	RUUX1HAD3P8UA	0316000647	657855247	Absolute Friends	Books	5	14	18	N	N	Rage at the Machine	This book is only partly a spy novel.  It is more the story of a journey.  That journey only begins when the main character Ted arrives in West Berlin of 1969 and pairs up with the student radical Sasha.  Ted is not really so political, but rather taken up by the enthusiasm of those around him.  After his years on military posts and British public schools the freedom of the Wohngemeinschaft must have been particularly liberating. <br /> <br />There is some brilliant imagery in this book - the snow-covered oval skywindow of Sasha's Kreuzberg loft; the cold, grimy reality of East Block cities of the late 1970's into the late 1980's; the person of Sasha himself who embodies much of the German spirit (not to mention its crippled modern history) that Ted finds so appealling. <br /> <br />Perhaps the greatest message that John leCarr gets across is his rage.  The great ideals for which the Cold War was waged have been betrayed.  Cynical opportunism and war profiteering, dressed in gaudy patriotic garb is the rule today.  Even our history has been repackaged, deformed, perverted to provide support for mindless militarism.  The betrayal of Western and US ideals, these same ideals that provided the necessary element  for the greatest triumph of positive human will which brought on the end of the Cold War, is what fuels leCarr's rage imo.  Contrary to what is sold to the American public today it was not US military power or Reaganism which \\"won\\" the Cold War, but the peoples of Eastern Europe themselves, who went out on the streets and freed their own countries, became actors in history.  For obvious reasons this has been flushed down the old memory hole.  It was the influence of America's ideals which mattered, the military and the intelligence effort played far lesser, supporting roles. <br /> <br />Today in their never ending wars against \\"terror\\", the enemy is faceless, unknown.  The distinction between public and private, corporate and state, friendly and enemy have become hopelessly blurred.  Pseudo Operations exist and with each outrage, one has to many times question the official version and simply ask \\"cuo bono\\"? <br /> <br />As a Cold War Intel Veteran I understand leCarr's rage because it is a rage we share. <br />	2004-11-24

As policy becomes more ambitious and vigorous, so will war, and this may reach the point where war attains its absolute form.  If we look at war in this light, we do not need to lose sight of this absolute: on the contrary, we must constantly bear it in mind.\\" Clausewitz, On War, Book 8, Chapter 6. <br /> <br />I've looked forward to reading this book for some time.  Here finally (I thought) there would be a Clausewitzian analysis of  our current political/military dilemma which would act as a sort of signpost, allowing for orientation and reassessment.  I've just received this book and have only read one chapter, but already I can say that it is something of a disappointment. <br /> <br />My rating is four stars, since I assume that the balance of the book will be an improvement over Chapter 12 - \\"Iraq: High-Tech versus Fourth Generation\\".  Any good book on strategic thought requires some time to contemplate, to think over.  Since the chapter on Iraq is current, and we can judge it based on reporting from Iraq through a Clausewitzian lens, I needn't wait to weigh the mass of dubious assumptions that pass for analysis concerning Operation Iraqi Freedom.  A thoughtful Clausewitzian analysis requires a hard look at the situation on the ground and an honest attempt to get beyond one's own cultural or national outlook/interests.  One must try very hard not to deceive oneself. <br /> <br />Col. Hammes starts with a quotation from Clausewitz, which is appropriate, but then fails to follow up on exactly what Clausewitz means by \\"nature\\".  Referring to the paragraph preceding that quote is helpful here, \\"First, therefore, it is clear that war should never be thought of as something autonomous but always as an instrument of policy; otherwise the entire history of war would contradict us.  Only this approach will enable us to penetrate the problem intelligently.  Second, this way of looking at it will show us how wars must vary with the nature of their motives and of the situation which give rise to them.\\" On War, Book 1 Chapter 1 Section 27. <br /> <br />So the nature of any war is determined by its subjective  political goals, since war is an instrument of policy, not something autonomous, with the influence of that policy going through the entire course of the war into the following peace, as Clausewitz points out elsewhere.  So where is the discussion of what exactly US policy is?   <br /> <br />There is no discussion, there is no thought given as to how the extensive nature of US war aims in Iraq define the nature of that war.  Instead, we are told that \\"the Bush administration failed to understand the type of war they were embarking on.  They tried to turn it into a short, high-technology, conventional war. . . Unfortunately, the underlying nature of the Iraq War is not that of a high-tech war but rather that of a fourth-generation netwar\\", page 172. <br /> <br />That is not \\"the underlying nature of Iraq war\\", it is rather \\"the grammar\\" of that specific war that Hammes is describing, that with the metaphor \\"4th Generation Warfare\\".  What makes the Iraq war 4th Generation, and not just another Guerrilla war, or a war of national liberation similar to that in Spain against Napoleon in 1809?  There are in fact a great many simularities with that bloodbath as even a simple viewing of Goya's works will make clear.  Hammes provides no convincing answer. <br /> <br />My main complaint here is not the use of the term \\"4th Generation Warfare\\", but the Procrustian bed of catagories that it seems to entail.  Should we not rather look at the four generations of warfare as Ideal Types, that is as being pure conceptual tools with which to measure reality, instead of trying to get reality to fit our measure?  Are not modern militaries a combination of various complex elements belonging to all three (or even four) generations, and even pre-modern warfare? <br /> <br />Under weaknesses, Hammes notes that the Anti-Coalition Forces (a much better term than the Administration's \\"Anti-Iraqi Forces\\") \\"lack a unifying political creed\\", and \\"have no comprehensive plan for the future of Iraq\\".  Their unifying creed may simply be Iraqi Nationalism as it was in 1920 against the British, what more do they need?  And, is not simply rejecting our plan enough?  As to not having any unity, their dispersion and decentralization is necessary, since if they were to form a united front we would target that front.  Their nebulous consistency, btw, is also pure Clausewitz as pointed out in his chapter, \\"The People in Arms\\". <br /> <br />In short, the Iraqis have every reason to fight us since they seemingly reject the Bush Administration's vision of what Iraq's future must be.  This is tied to the radical and extensive nature of our war aims - not the public war aims of WMD - but the restructuring of the Iraqi state, the disbanding of their army and civil service, the implementation of \\"market forces\\" which is in effect the economic control of the country by foreign investors, not to mention the permanent stationing of US forces in Iraq.  \\"Their government\\" consists of exiles (many former Baath party members) and dual nationals who have little following in Iraq.  Hammes mentions \\"the daily improvement in power, sanitation, water and trade\\", but this is going on behind a backdrop of the constant aerial bombardment of their population centers. <br /> <br />The assumptions go on and on, piled one upon another.  Yet there is no mention at all of how our extensive war goals require as Clausewitz points out, \\"great physical and moral superiority or else an extremely enterprising spirit, an inclination for serious risk\\".  In effect we are demanding that the Iraqis accept under threat of violence a new political identity, one which has been an abject failure so far.  This is the same policy that Israel has pursued with the Palestinians which by the way has also been a failure.  By confusing the nature of the war with its subjective grammar, and labelling it \\"4th Generation\\", we conflate this dubious \\"war of choice\\" with the very real struggle against Al Qaida.  <br /> <br />I am not arguing that there is no such entity that we could refer to as \\"more or less 4th Generational\\", and I believe that Al Qaida is a serious threat, but conflating the struggle against Al Qaida with the Iraqi debacle, which was unnecessary and fought for very questionable goals (I would say goals which betray our ideals as Americans) we have injured ourselves seriously, as well as our prospects in the real conflict with Al Qaida.   <br /> <br />Instead of offering us a way out of this quagmire, Col. Hammes has only added to the general confusion.  <br />	2004-10-20

As much as Professor Chomsky is one of the few real American intellectuals left who has a wide audience, I find much of what he says here to be repetitive. . . He sees more or less the same bad guys he would have seen in 1952 (Truman after all who was also one of our most Liberal Presidents), in 1962 (JFK), and even in 1980 under Carter.  The problem has always been the National Security State and the crimes perpetrated in its name or rather in the pursuit of empire. . .  but does it then follow that the rise of &quot;Reaganism&quot; is simply more of the same, the latest version of something that was rotten from the beginning?  I reject this view.<br />Reaganism is the name I use to refer to the confused ideology that hides under the label of &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;Repubilican&quot; today.  It is btw neither in any real sense of either word.  <br />This is where Chomsky's argument falls flat imo, in his failure to see and gauge the radical and &quot;fascistic nature&quot; of Reaganism for what it is.  <br />Finally it would be nice for Professor Chomsky to break loose from his past and give his readers something more beyond the same old &quot;evil American Empire&quot; song and dance . . . If Hunter S. Thompson can do it then so can Chomsky.<br />Anyway I don't buy his story, think it far more complex than<BR>that, think that we have turned a corner since 2000 with Reaganism and that our noble experiment is in danger of being destroyed for good. . .	2003-11-29

I suspect the author, with a strong sense of family, wanted to have something to present to his decedents, something that he had completed as a young man still with the full emotion and confusion of the initial bewildering and catastrophic events that were the fate of his generation.<br />This memoir is interesting on a variety of levels.  One is the account of mountain infantry training the author received as a young volunteer for the Waffen SS.  Far from politically indoctrinated fanatics, we see an elite military organization preparing men for combat in modern war.  I suspect that the emphasis on political and racial indoctrination was more a product of the pre-war years, when the Waffen SS was seen as a force against potential enemies within the Reich, not after say 1941 when large numbers of new replacements were needed to man an expanding number of divisions fighting in foreign theaters of operations.  That and the fact that many foreign volunteers, some from ethnic groups lower on the SS pecking order, where filling the ranks of these formations as well.  The emphasis went from \\"elite order of racial Uebermenschen\\" to \\"cadre of the common European struggle against Bolshevism\\".  This latter attitude is mentioned by the author numerous times and obviously was one of his main reasons for joining the organization.<br />On another level is the sociological perspective of various views common among Germans during 1941-3.  He sees his own class in school as divided between the idealists and the pragmatists.  Some, like the author, saw the war as a personal challenge and were eager to commit themselves, while others saw it as the business of others and hoped to survive the chaos as best as possible, which is hardly the usual view we have of German youth of that time.  Interesting in that the author shows us how universal this conflict of views is.  One need only think of the attitudes of the generation of young Americans confronted with the Vietnam War and how they reacted, although in some cases in later life only to adopt the opposite view when it no longer required a personal commitment.<br />So some of us can respect the author's decision to serve his country as a soldier in wartime.  But the branch he chose to serve with was the Waffen SS, part of the larger SS, which was to be branded a criminal organization by the Allied courts due to their administration of the Holocaust among other crimes.  The author admits the crimes and the guilt of the SS (he found out about the death camps and other atrocities as a POW after the war), but can't condemn all his comrades, most of whom are dead, as criminals in serving a cause which they believed in, which the author never thinks included common knowledge of the criminal character of the SS.  It is a quandary for which the author never finds an answer, perhaps because no answer is possible.  That the author saw the Nazis as having perverted all the values that his generation had believed in, of destroying his country in a senseless war while pursuing the most inhuman crimes imaginable is tempered by the fact that he doesn't see the defeat of Germany as a liberation. . .   See page 133.  <br />The mistake was in not overthrowing the criminal regime themselves, which was a \\"disgrace\\", but in having to have their enemies do it for them.  Furthermore, the final outcome of the National Socialist swindle was not inevitable, \\"All the same one lesson is clear: never again must there be any public authority without active popular control\\".  Page 71. <br />There are others points the author mentions as well such as the belief common in Germany after the First World War that a new movement which would do away with the old distinctions of class and status, create a Volksgemeinschaft, was necessary for national rebirth.  Also of special note are his interesting and gratifying comments concerning US troops in action and his description of Operation Birke, the German evacuation of their Lapland Army from Finland to Norway in the fall of 1944, an arduous trek of over 1600 kilometers conducted in good order under pressure from both the Red Army and later the German's former allies, the Finns.  I doubt that this unique military achievement of the Lapland Army will ever be repeated.<br />This book should be of interest to all readers interested in the Eastern Front in World War II, particularly since it is one of the few accounts available of fighting on the Karelian sector, those interested in the history of the Waffen SS or those interested in a sociological perspective of Germany during World War II.	2002-10-20

Perhaps, because \\"classical Greece still offers us the best - perhaps the only intellectual - explanation for how the pragmatic concerns of our own daily existence in Western society have been addressed and solved\\" (page 7).  As you may guess, overall, I enjoyed this book.  Professor Victor Davis Hanson is knowledgeable of his subject, writes fairly well and provides some insightful comments.  Exactly what one would expect from a good work of military history, however there is something of a bad aftertaste to the work.  <br />To start he takes the famous German historian Hans Delbrück to task for not being \\"merely wrong, but also misleading\\" (page 23).  He quotes Delbrück as to numbers of troops engaged in ancient battle, but seems to misunderstand the German historian's point.  He believes that Delbrück thinks that mass always decide a battle, that the biggest battalions always win, but that is not the point that Delbrück is trying to get across.  Rather he is interested in questioning the numbers that are quoted by the ancients.  For example, Herodotus records that the Persian army under Xerses numbered 2,641,610 fighting men and at least as many crew members, servants, and camp followers.<br />Delbrück concluded, based on the actual size of the plain of Marathon and the contemporary estimates of the population of ancient Greece that the Greek army numbered 12,000 men and the Persians, a professional army emphasizing quality, even less.  So contrary to Herodotus, the Greeks were not greatly outnumbered, but more numerous, which goes against Hanson's thesis of the overwhelming nature of the Greek phalanx.  It should be pointed out that Delbrück is consistent in his questioning of numbers given in the original ancient sources.  He also proved rather decisively that Caesar inflated the numbers of his opponents in Gaul for political reasons.  Questioning numbers is a part of what is known as Sachkritik, since as Delbrück wrote, \\"a movement that a troop of 1,000 men executes without difficulty is a hard task for 10,000 men, a work of art for 50,000, an impossibility for 100,000\\".<br />In all Hanson unjustly criticises Delbrück, fails to mention, let alone answer, the valid questions he brings up concerning Marathon and then misleads his readers as to Delbrück's true attitude and the quality of his contribution to ancient studies.  He then goes on to use Sachkritik, that is Delbrück's own method, in his own historical analysis.  As I said, bad aftertaste. . .<br />Many of the Hanson's own attitudes come out clearly in the work as well, as when he seems to lament that the Greek hoplites may have gone into battle \\"drunk\\", that is having had wine with their meal before the battle.  This almost caused me to laugh out loud as I was reading the book.  Having worked in Europe for almost 20 years I think poor Professor Hanson would be shocked, SHOCKED, to know that hundreds of thousands of Europeans also have wine with their meals and function very well afterwards thank you.<br />Finally he fails to mention the influence of the rise of the Athenian navy on democracy in ancient Athens, since is was the growing importance of propertyless Athenian sailors, unlike their propertied fellow citizens serving as hoplites who supplied their own expensive weapons and armor, that made Athenian democracy something trully different.  This is taken pretty much as a given in historical sociology, but Hanson seems to prefer the hoplites as the limit of his elitest view of ancient democracy, and fails to mention this rather important influence of military technology on social development.  <br />In short, we see influence of highly subjective attitudes and politics in his work which leaves this reader with a bad aftertaste.  In all a good book with some interesting  comments on the nature of Greek infantry battle, but marred by the author's own rather obvious blindspots.	2002-08-21

Unlike perhaps all other accounts of the start of the Great War, Eksteins' emphasises the actions of the crowds, \\"the fine days of that July and August encouraged Europeans to venture out of their homes and to display their emotions and prejudices in public, in the streets and squares of their cities and towns.  The massive exhibitions of public sentiment played a crucial role in determining the fate of Europe that summer.  Had it been a wet and cold summer, like that of the previous year of the next one, would a fairground atmosphere conductive to soapbox oratory and mass hysteria have developed?  Would leaders then have been prepared to declare war so readily?  There is evidence that the jingoistic crowd scenes in Berlin, St. Petersburg, Vienna, Paris and London, in the last days of July and in the early days of August, pushed the political and military leadership of Europe toward confrontation.  That was certainly the case in Germany.  And Germany was the matrix of the storm. . .\\" pp55-56.<br />So instead of Pan-Germanism, or Pan-Slavism, or \\"Germany's Grab for World Power\\", or the clueless Kaiser signing a blank check to a conniving Hapsburg Empire, or a coldly calculating German General Staff knowing that time is against them, or a French-Russian-Serbian plot, that is all plays of grand power politics from on high, we see the old world leadership attempting to stay ahead of their respective raging publics, attempting to keep the frenzy from turning against them. . . interesting, and doubtlessly part of the story.<br />The influence of artistic currents are interesting, but hardly new.  Eksteins' thesis is similar in part to Werner Sombart's famous manifesto of German war propaganda of 1915, entitled \\"Merchants and Heroes\\".  Obviously, for Sombart, the English were the merchants and the Germans the heroes, social carriers of twoWeltanschauungen trapped in a fight to the finish, a struggle for the right to dictate the further course of \\"civilization\\" which was of course only Western in those days.<br />Cultural pessimism had been around since Nietzsche as Ekstein points out and reached its height around the turn of the century.  From that point it became more refined, discussed at length in the intellectual circles in Heidelberg, Vienna and elsewhere.  Contrary to a dominant feeling of \\"German\\" exclusivity, besides all the regional sympathies and animosities native to Germany, there were also many influential German intellectuals, such as Max Weber, a friend of Sombart's, who saw Britain's political system as offering something of a model for a politically reformed Germany.  The war and the frenzy which accompanied it made any such comparisons seem to recede in importance, to the presumed duty at hand.  Later such pronouncements would be considered dangerous.  To Weber's credit it should be pointed out that he argued publicly for domestic liberal reform while the war was actually in progress.  <br />Instead, centralization of state power to wage total war encompassing the total mobilization of society became the goal, not liberalization of the political system.  <br />In other words is it a question of the dreamer, the artistic side of the German character being the catalyst for the war frenzy of 1914 or is it the other way around?	2002-08-15

This is a great book for those interested in Weber or in social theory in general.  I would recommend reading Professor Kalberg's new translation of Weber's classic &quot;The Protestant Ethic &amp; The Spirit of Capitalism&quot; before tackling this book.  Kalberg's introduction to PE provides a nice intro to this book as well.<br />Of particular interest to me were the varied uses of Ideal Types and how they are shown by the author to have a &quot;broad-ranging theoretical capacity&quot; besides being useful has a heuristic yardstick in sociological comparisons.<br />All in all I came away with a sense of awe and respect for not only Max Weber's, but also Stephen Kalberg's achievement here -- The former in originating and conceptualizing and the latter in synthesizing and reconstructing Weber's intellectually stunning methodology and structure.  In short this is a brilliant work from one of today's foremost Weberian scholars.	2002-08-12

A soldier follows the orders of his superiors, goes where he is told, works as part of a team to perform a specific mission.  A warrior on the other hand fights, anyplace, anytime, anyway he sees fit, ignores the actions of his \\"superiors\\" if he so chooses and stays on or goes home when he wants.<br />Collins seems committed and showed unquestioning courage in fighting for his cause.  His distinction between what he sees as legitimate jihad, what he did in Chechnya for example, and \\"a bunch of cowards in Egypt killing old ladies and kids in the name of jihad\\" (the attacks of April 1996 and November 1997) is important in possibly building a conceptual wedge between Islamic warriors defending unarmed Muslims and terrorist acts such as 9-11.  This distinction or rather confusion is obvious in the videos made of would be \\"martyrs\\" among the Palestinians, who sport camouflaged uniforms and AK's and make martial poses for the video, only to in reality wear a baggy coat to hide explosives when they detonate themselves in a crowded place full of civilians.  They obviously wish to see themselves as real jihadis and not as cowardly murderers.  Not surprisingly Collins sees the latter as a threat to his religion.<br />He converted to Islam while in a California Youth Authority prison and seems to have found peace in that religion, which only brings out one of its apparent paradoxes.  How can the fastest growing religion on earth, one that appeals to so many millions on an individual level be so unable to deal with modernity or in separating the concepts of religion and the state at the macro level, that is \\"rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's\\"?  In my view Islam is rapidly approaching a social/political crisis which has been a very long time in the making.  When dealing with such a powerful sociological force, it is better for non-Muslim societies to step aside, let it \\"play itself out\\", rather than meet it head on.<br />In addition his comments in connection with the attacks of 9-11 are interesting.  He knew at least one of the highjackers personally and questions the government version of events. His description of a \\"terrorist training camp\\" in Afghanistan also calls into question what exactly has been accomplished with Bush's easy overthrow of the Taliban government.  As in the past getting in to Afghanistan is the easy part, getting out in one piece and with something to show for it is the far more difficult.    <br />Just more indications that we need an independent commission to investigate the events which led up to and surround the attacks of 9-11, in order to get a better picture of exactly who was responsible and who are real enemies are.	2002-08-12

A good background in 20th Century military history as well as Clausewitz is necessary to get the most from this very impressive work.  So why bother?  What are the uses of Neo-Clausewitzian Strategic Thought?<br />In the post 9-11 world there is no better way in my opinion to understand the Al Qaida threat.  Professor Gray published this work in 1999, but his views and methodology remain as important as ever.<br />The reason for this is that the grammar of war changes (the ways we fight it, the increasingly complex \\"elements\\"), while the nature of war remains the same.  Politics and political goals have always been the core reasons for the violent struggle of wills between polities which we call war.  That was true in ancient times and remains true today.<br />Following Clausewitz and Gray I think one could make a very convincing case that Al Qaida is waging war in three forms simultaneously-- guerrilla war, terrorist war and revolutionary war which all put heavy emphasis on the political.  With this in mind our MAIN  weapon against Al Qaida should be our foreign (political) policy, not an emphasis on high-tech, military responses against obscure targets, the resulting \\"colateral\\" destruction only hurting our political policy and playing to the goals of our enemies.  Such are the nuances of Clausewitzian strategic thought, far from the \\"war-as-ideal Mahdi of Mass\\" strawman usually portrayed by the great strategic theorist's detractors.<br />Of interest also are Gray's appreciation of the contributions of John R. Boyd, his untangling of the confusion surrounding the term \\"Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), and his comments on the little known (or understood) impact of the Second Smuts Report of 1917.<br />In all this book is a great work in strategic thought of high intellectual merit.  Of interest also is a recent article in the Spring issue of Parameters by Gray on Asymmetrical Warfare.	2002-06-05

It is organized alphabetically by topic and provides clear explanations to various types of usage.  Need to find out about the use of the subjunctive form in English or whether it is permitted to use they/them/their to refer to a single indefinite person?  This reference can answer those as well as many other elementary or advanced questions that may come up.  The only source of confusion I have found was his partial omitting the terms 0,1,2,3 and Mixed Conditional tenses, grouping these all instead under &quot;if&quot;.  Many students learn the conditional tenses using the 0-M system and find it quite handy and useful in learning the various structures and meanings.  The author mentions types 1-3 on pages 245-6, and then goes on to insist quite correctly that there are many different structures for &quot;if&quot;.  However, he fails to mention the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;M&quot; conditionals, which would account for most of the rest (including conditional sentences that do not use &quot;if&quot;).  In all this could be a rather minor irritant to at least some users of this book.  <br />To repeat my view, this is an excellent reference and one I recommend to my advanced students.	2001-02-28

First published in 1977, it remains a unique work among World War II histories.  Essentially the book is a history of the formation (especially the politics involved) and personnel policies of the SS Totenkopf Division from 1933-45.  Those looking for a history of the battles, in which SSTK fought, especially during 1943-45, will have to look elsewhere.<br />In addition to the other strengths of this work let me point out two that I have not seen mentioned in any of the other reviews:<br />First the author provides very interesting information on the comings and goings of SSTK officers and men between the division and other SS authorities, especially the concentration/extermination camps.  From the SS ideological perspective both organizations, the Waffen SS at the front and the camp guards were performing the same function, fighting the same merciless enemy.  It is interesting that the SS stressed from the very beginning of the war that &quot;guard duty in the camps was no less soldierly or important than service in the front lines.  The SS Totenkopf units guarding and running the camps were depicted as heroic detachments filled with exemplary SS men performing an invaluable service by protecting Germany from the internal enemies&quot; behind the wire (see footnote p 324).  For the SS the fanatical enemy faced in Russia which supposedly hoped to destroy Germany was the same as the helpless inmates being driven to the gas chambers of Auschwitz, killing either in as great of numbers as possible guaranteed not only Nazi victory, but the physical survival of the German race in its death struggle with the &quot;Jewish-Bolsheviks&quot;.   As an explanation for the unexplainable this attitude along with the terrible experiences of the SSTK on the Eastern Front does much to answer the question as to how such slaughter of innocent civilians was possible.  Today such simplistic thinking seems ludicrous,but we should not underestimate the effect of racist or other type of exclusionist ideology on young minds that are indoctrinated over a period of years from figures in authority (not to mention specially-selected fanatics) that they trust.  An indication of the power of their persuasion is the fact that in May 1940 only four men in the entire division had not publicly renounced Christianity (see footnote p 85). <br />The second point, which comes out in the book was the wastefulness of such units as SSTK for the German war effort.  The author mentions repeated complaints of German Army commanders as to the high battle casualty rates among the SSTK, rates due in many cases to incompetent officers.  Also due to the stringent selection process that Eicke maintained men who could have served as officers or NCOs in other formations, served as privates in the SSTK.  This was a trait common to all the Waffen SS formations, the Army's Grossdeutschland Division and all the Luftwaffe ground formations.  Germany, facing so many enemies, could simply not afford wasteful misuse of men or material.  It would have been far better to have utilized such men in the regular Army formations insuring that they received the proper replacements, qualified leaders and equipment rather than concentrating these scare resources in a handful of elite formations to the disadvantage of the army in general.  In the case of the SS and Luftwaffe this wasteful policy was clearly due to internal Nazi political considerations.  Of course such elite units provide interesting history. . . Compare this to the Soviet practice of combat units earning a &quot;Guards&quot; designation for success in combat.<br />All in all this is a very worthwhile book for those interested in World War II or Holocaust history in general and those interested in the history of the SS in particular.	2001-02-26
US	51104090	R3E0FQQOKZVDLQ	0891415750	24864137	Moltke on the Art of War: Selected Writings	Books	5	46	48	N	N	Moltke vs Clausewitz	Count Helmut von Moltke was perhaps the greatest military leader during the period between Napoleon and the First World War.  Moltke shaped the way that the German Army looked at war up until 1945.  What was important to Moltke was not a set of rules or principles, but rather a way of thinking.  Initiative and control were stressed, &quot;when in doubt advance toward the sound of the guns&quot;. . . While he had great respect for the Prussian philosopher of war, Carl von Clausewitz, whom he had limited contact with as a young staff officer, Moltke rejected several of Clausewitz's most important concepts, perhaps the most eventful being the place of the military in strategic decisions made during time of war.  For Moltke the military should simply be allowed to fight the war to the finish at which time the political leadership would be allowed to negotiate the peace.  Clausewitz saw war as the continuation of politics by other means, meaning that political decisions did not end with the commencement of hostilities but continued.  The editor of this book mentions several similarities including one that upon closer study is in reality another break between the two outlooks.  Referring to Book 6, Chapter 8 of On War, he mentions that Clausewitz wrote, &quot;that all strategic planning rested on tactical success alone, because only tactical successes could produce a favorable outcome.&quot;  Moltke obviously agreed since he thought, &quot;strategy grows silent in the face of the need for a tactical victory.&quot;  However if one actually reads that chapter in On War one comes away with a different impression since Clausewitz's view is far more nuanced than that of Moltke.  Clausewitz had experienced terrible defeat and great hardship during the struggle against Napoleon, having served with the Russians during the fateful campaign of 1812.  It was the experience of that campaign which showed Clausewitz the importance of a Fabian strategy (denying battle, allowing an enemyto exhaust himself through exertion).  Thus Clausewitz writes, &quot;One may admit that even where the decision has been bloodless, it was determined in the last analysis by engagements that did not take place, but had merely been offered.  In that case, it will be argued, the strategic planning of these engagements, rather that the tactical decision should be considered the operative principle. . . That is why we think it is useful to emphasize that all strategic planning rests on tactical success alone, and that  -whether the solution is arrived at in battle or not - this is in all cases the fundamental basis for the decision.&quot;<br />Moltke, during his most successful period, could only see the winning of offensive battles as assuring strategic success.  For this reason he developed his strategic sequence which combined mobilization, transportation, deployment, movement and combat into one continuous chain of events.  Widely deployed forces would converge at the proper moment and destroy the enemy in a complete or partial envelopment.  This worked well in 1866 against the Austrians and in 1870 against the French.  His system seemed to promise victory in any war.  He had taken the gift of fire from Prometheus and changed its very nature, or so his followers thought.  Moltke himself grew more cautious in his later years, suggesting that only a partial success could be achieved in a war against both France and Russia, a political solution would have to be found for the strategic dilemma instead.  During the period up to and following the First World War, most German military thinkers followed Moltke's earlier views while giving lip service to Clausewitz.  Moltke was the more modern man, the technician of war for the machine age, while Clausewitz was a philosopher, belonging to another time and mode of thinking, or so it seemed.<br />Professor Hughes' book provides translations of various examples of Moltke's writings.  I found Moltke's views on the training andduties of General Staff officers particularly interesting.  The editor includes excellent commentary on various German military terms and the ways that they have been translated into English in the past, some rather confusing.  <br />In all I find this book well worth the money and would recommend it to those interested in German military history, 19th Century military history, and military strategy and tactics in general, particularly the evolution of military thought.  What seems to be missing is an edition of the works of Sigismund von Schlichting, who as Hughes points out provides the key link between Moltke's theories and modern theory.	2001-02-13

Dmitri Volkogonov's book,  Trotsky, provides a stimulating portrait of this fascinating personality  and the various roles/political outlooks that he struggled through.<br />To  start let's consider Volkoganov's view of the 2nd Party Congress held in  London in the summer of 1903.  Far from repeating the usual interpretation,  he offers a new one, namely that instead of being simply a question of  party organization which divided the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party,  it was \\"over a difference in the theory and practice of revolutionary  methodology.  The congress formalized the coexistence of two parallel  tendencies: one radical, revolutionary and uncompromising, which would  characterize the Bolsheviks; the other reformist, evolutionary and  parliamentary, which was to become the hallmark of those henceforth known  as Mensheviks\\" page 29.  As the author mentions, it is also interesting to  note that the original platform of the RSDLP advocated democracy, secret  suffrage, inviolability of the person, freedom of thought, speech, press,  movement, assembly, strikes and trade unions as well as other similar  goals.  <br />How did all these noble dreams of a great humanist state end up  as a mass gulag?  The answer in one word is Lenin.  Lenin, the egotistical  nihilist, rejected out of hand any \\"bourgeois theory\\", relying solely  instead on his own interpretation of Marx and Engels.  Any non-Bolshevik  political opponent wassubject to the worst sort of derogatory comments and  personal attack.  In March of 1917, Lenin arrived in revolutionary  Petrograd unwilling to compromise with anyone and enjoying unlimited  financial resources thanks to the German General Staff.  Trotsky, who had  since joined the Bolsheviks, supported Lenin's hard line unquestioningly.   While the Provisional Government worried of an attack from the right,  Lenin, ever the cynical opportunist, promised an end to the war and land to  the peasants.  Bolshevik agitators spread through the army to convince the  troops to desert or simply ignore the orders of their officers.  By October  the stage was set, a radical party of limited support and scope was able to  overthrow what remained of the Provisional Government with little effort or  bloodshed, but by rejecting all compromise and by ruthlessly exercising  complete power, Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks made the Russian Civil  War a reality.  After the October \\"Revolution\\" Trotsky became ever more  important to Lenin, whose effectiveness as a speaker was limited.  As  Yaroslavsky described him at the time, Trotsky was \\"a man most profoundly  dedicated to the revolution, a man who has grown up to be a tribune, with a  tongue as finely honed and flexible as steel, a tongue that can cut his  enemies down, and a pen which scatters a wealth of ideas like handfuls of  artistic pearls.\\"  Page 82.<br />Perhaps the author's most important view is  that the tragedy that became the Soviet Union required each of the  Bolshevik triumvirate to play the part he was most suited for.  Lenin was  the ruthless opportunist, his unquestioning will to destroy and control by  terror setting the tone and shape of the entire system.  Stalin was the  pathological paranoid master of conspiracy, the consolidator, basically a  fascistic criminal, who had got his start in the Party as a bank robber.   And Trotsky?  He provided the siren's song for the masses, the pure light  of his reason projected to attract a storm of adolescent and unquestioning  human devotion and energy willing to follow whoever held the red flag.  Is  it any wonder that Trotsky didn't outlast the Civil War period by very  long?  After his expulsion, Trotsky provided the excuse for Stalin's  tyranny, even supplying the ideological framework for the disasterous  \\"Second October Revolution\\" of 1928-40.  The Bolshevik system required all  three and played itself out in a very mechanical, a very deterministic way,  success meant retaining absolute power and in that one sense, the only goal  with any meaning for Lenin, it was successful until 1991 when the machinary  collapsed.   <br />Why do unrepentant Leninists in the West continue with the  charade that Bolshevism held any hope for mankind?  Pride and egotism,  along with a cynical and patronizing view of humanity blind them to the  shambles all around them, block their noses from the smell of the  grimacing, yet rancid Leninist corpse that they have strapped to their  backs.  That and the role they play as scarecrow/whipping boy for the  reactionary and Reaganist right which automatically labels any opposition  to the corporate-dominated national security state as \\"communism\\" gives  them a false, yet ego-enhancing, sense of importance.  In other words  they'd love to stop acting like trick dogs, but they can't give up the  attention they get.  <br />This book and the author's biography on Lenin tell  the whole sordid history.  Time for the \\"left\\" to finally bury the Leninist  corpse and decide on a counter-argument that exposes Reaganist  \\"behind-closed-doors-government\\".  What America especially needs is a new  urge and will to protect our basic human rights and liberties, such as the  original goals of our Founding Fathers or, for that matter, of the RSDLP.   Nobody needs another utopian ideology, such as Leninism or some deluted,  \\"people-friendly\\" version of Reaganism, but a pragmatic program that sees  humanity, its naturalphysical environment and its artifical economic  environment for what they are and responds accordingly.	2000-09-03
US	51104090	R2TZRF7OUJERZG	0691015945	214663564	Dueling	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A Question of Status	Say you were a young German male, a college graduate, a member of a fine family and while at a party a drunken army officer made a crude comment to  your girlfriend.  Say the time was 1900.  You would be honor-bound to  challenge the rouge to a duel and probably would not have even questioned  whether it was proper or not, whether you would be better off simply  letting the insult pass.  As a perceived member of the top five percent of  the German population considered able \\"of providing satisfaction\\" (it was  up to you to make the distinction as to whether you belonged, that the  officer belonged was indisputable) you would be required to challenge or  thus lose all claim to elite social status.  You would have seen the slight  has not one against your girlfriend, but as one against yourself, your  honor, since the perpetrator obviously expected to get away with this  insult unpunished.  By offering a challenge you became his equal and by  accepting it he accepted you.  Honor was in the act of coolly facing death  at the hands of a worthy opponent, showing your courage.  In all an  antiquated attitude as seen from our perspective or to some even idiotic,  but worthy I think of tempered respect since it showed despite its faults  and trivialities a spirit of nobility and honor largely forgotten and  almost incomprehensible in our materialistically-obsessed world today.   <br />Kevin McAleer's book, Dueling, The Cult of Honor in Fin-de-Sièle Germany  is a brilliant attempt to dissect a society confronted on one side with  rationalized industrial modernity and \\"traditional\\" concepts of honor,  manliness, courage and duty on the other.  In a society increasingly  dominated by new elites who achieved their status by making money or  acquiring an education, the older Junkers saw their concept of  \\"Standesehre\\" or class honor, as being one of the few unique qualities they  retained.  As McAleer points out however, the urge of the up and coming  elites to the duel was almost insatiable.  German Catholic and Jewish  student groups, traditionally considered incapable of giving satisfaction  by the Protestant Junkers, were some of the most enthusiastic duelists  prior to World War I, while dueling among military officers actually  declined.<br />Why did dueling last so long in Germany?  In Britain it had  disappeared by 1850 and in the US died for the most part with the  Confederacy in 1865.  Here McAleer goes into the importance of the army in  German society, in its still intact aristocracy of that time and in the  desire of the newly formed middle classes to ape their social \\"betters\\" in  all forms.  <br />The book describes the whole process of dueling such as the  levels of insult (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree), the duties and importance of  seconds, negotiations between seconds, different forms of pistol duels, the  student Mensur, a strange variant known as the \\"American duel\\" and much  more.  According to McAleer lethality increased greatly with the  introduction of rifled-bore pistols.  Still, one in four German duels was  with sabers, which were hardly ever lethal.  Along the way he destroys  several myths about dueling that have come to us through Hollywood, such as  the free for all sword fight with flying furniture, obstacle course run  around and flowing conversation as well as the act of one duelist blatantly  firing into the air.  As the author points out, any self-respecting German  duelist would have seen this latter action on the part of his opponent as  an additional insult, an indication that he was not worthy of even  participating in the duel.  The author also provides the various German and  French language terms in italics to aid in further study.    In all a very  interesting book that should please anyone interested in German History,  the History of World War I, or 19th Century European History.	2000-08-23

George Orwell's Animal Farm is such a work.  We can read  it as a child's fable or as a description of the 1917 Russian Revolution  with Snowball-Trotski, Napoleon-Stalin, Old Major-Lenin (or is it Marx?)  and Squealer-a collection of various Stalinist toadies- providing the  history lesson.  That can be instructive and we come away feeling that we  understand the fundamental dynamics of totalitarianism, in all quite  contented with ourselves.<br />That would however be missing the most  important point for Americans today that is brought out in the book.  Dictatorship doesn't arise in one fateful moment, people don't become  manipulated pawns overnight, rights are not eroded or even reversed with  one blatant stroke of a pen on a governmental decree.  If anything the  history of 20th Century dictatorships shows us that this is a gradual  process as in Orwell's book.  Napoleon's plans are put into effect slowly;  the laws are changed methodically one by one, at night when the animals are  asleep.  History itself is taken away and washed of any conflicting  elements that displease the powers in control or bring up uncomfortable  questions.  Gross inequalities are said to be necessary, unavoidable, even  positive, while a strong police presence backed with cruel punishments  discourage any overt opposition.  The most important element of control is  to convince the people that things are \\"better\\" than before without  actually telling them what the \\"before\\" was like.  Convince them that  theirs is the best of all possible worlds without really comparing it to  anything else.  Arouse their sense of patriotism and use popular symbols to  distract and confuse.  All this is shown in the book to be very effective  in establishing and maintaining control, all the while the real condition  of the animals/citizens only worsens, the manipulation and domination only  becomes more obvious, more difficult to rationalize and explain away.<br />Now  for the clincher - How has OUR country changed in the last 20 years?  Are  we as a people more manipulated and dominated by unseen and unaccountable  plutocratic elites, less in control of our supposedly democratic government  than in 1980?  Are we, the common people, not confronted today with a far  more refined, more subtle type of control and domination, which allows us  steadily decreasing room to move about, a constantly constricting pen so to  speak, whose artificial veneer of \\"liberty\\" is wearing increasingly thin?  Is it even allowed in polite company to pose such questions?<br />A  biologist friend of mine tells me that if a frog is put into a pan of hot  water it will jump out, but put the same frog in a pan of cool water and  gradually increase the temperature to boiling, the frog will stay in the  pan until his eyes burst.  Perhaps we Americans should ask ourselves where  we are, metaphorically speaking, in the Animal Farm herarchy.  Are we at  least hard-working horses who occasionally question what is done supposedly  in our name, or are we simple frogs, sweating now, only semi-sentient, but  still smug and stupid in our belief that things will only get better?, more difficult to rationalize and explain away.<br />Now  for the clincher - How has OUR country changed in the last 20 years?

US	51104090	R3MKCL69KM6S4B	0865274231	978537760	Storm of Steel From the Diary of a German Stormtroop Officer on the Western Front	Books	5	65	68	N	N	During War A Soldier Should Never Mention the Word �Peace�	Ernst Jünger's memoirs of his service as a junior officer with the 73rd Hannoverian Fusilier Regiment on the Western Front are different than any other war memoirs I've read.  Jünger provides a cold, insightful, yet  evenhanded view of the war in the trenches.  He respects the English  soldiers he's up against, hears funny stories about pre-war Cambrai from  the elderly French couple in whose house he's been quartered, and is  invited along with his comrades to share bountiful suppers with Flemish  farmers.  While passionate about the honor he must uphold as a soldier and  his support of the \\"idea\\", he refuses to demonize his enemy.<br />His  descriptions of the fighting are horrific.  At Guillemont, during the  battle of the Somme as they are digging out their foxholes, he notices that  the \\"earth\\" is composed of layers, representing each company that had been  fed into the furnace, annihilated, ground to bits only to be replaced by  the next company and the next. . . Whole units disappear without a trace.   For Jünger the battlefield has its metaphysical element:  Gas mask-clad  pickets become demons that he converses with, fields of dead and dying  exude a sweet smell that drives the living giddy, men disappear for no  apparant reason and are never seen again.  <br />Yet for Jünger even though 10  out of 12 soldiers fall, the desolation of war emphasizes and even  spiritualizes the joy produced by the noble drive to endure and overcome  battle.  The fire of war produced over the four years of his service an  ever purer and nobler warrior ethos.  For this description alone is perhaps  the book worth reading, since it provides us with a link to an  aristrocratic/military ideal which put service to that ideal above  everything else, even one's own survival.  Not that such men were prepared  to waste their lives, that is the view of today, but that they were  prepared to sacrifice themselves in defense of an ideal, or even a sense of  honor without which life would have been unbearable.<br />After reading the  above comment on the ethos, on page 159 of the German edition, I noted \\"but  at what cost?\\" in the margine.  As in so many human endeavors, we are  confronted with the unintended consequences of a chosen course of action.   Jünger's generation offered themselves, their best and brightest in a cause  that they believed in, resulting in two million war dead along with  hundreds of thousands of maimed and broken bodies and spirits.  Putting the  economic argument aside for a moment, we can say that when the true crisis  came, in 1933, there were too few men of honor left alive or conscious to  withstand the onslaught of the refuse, of those without any sense of honor,  of the haters, all to the great misfortune of not only the country they  served, but of all of Europe.	2000-07-21

That is true but he is also very much a man of our times, with both the advantages and disadvantages of the current Weltanschauung.  I  bought this book after having read some rather rave reviews and had high  expectations.  I can't say that I have got anything from this book that I  didn't already have or suspect.  He's reinforced some of my opinions  without adding to my empherical knowledge to back them.  The concept of the  individual, individualism if you will, is dominant today, representing a  narrow and superficial deformation of the Western idea.  Market Capitalism  does not guarantee democracy; you can have poor democracies and prosperous  dictatorships. Today we are in an unconscious process of masochistic  suicide destroying the very substance of our public institutions,  institutions which were the products of decades of thought and democratic  debate, all in the pursuit of making things more `effective', more  `business-like'. . .  So according to Saul, and on target IMHO, but what  does this all mean?  What can we draw from these intermediate  conclusions?<br />He then goes on to describe the crisis that grips the West,  which he dates from 1973.  Bureaucratic thinking and rationalization  continue to manipulate our perceptions, dominate and drive our existence,  controlled by what he describes as `Corporatism'.  He states, \\"the  corporatist movement was born in the nineteenth century as an alternative  to democracy.  It proposed the legitimacy of groups over that of the  individual citizen.\\" Pp16-17<br />Napoleon, Hegel and Bismarck helped the  process along by emphasizing rule by elites and adherence to the state.   This was all only a lead up to the great <br />\\"new all-powerful clockmaker  god - the marketplace - and his archangel, technology.  Trade is the  marketplace's miraculous cure for all that ails us. . . I would suggest  that Marxism, fascism and the marketplace strongly resemble each other.   They are all corporatist, managerial and hooked on technology as their own  particular golden calf.\\" Pp19-20<br />Amazing how simple it all is.  He then  goes on to blame Max Weber for having given \\"corporatism a sophisticated  intellectual shape\\". . . In what way?  Weber warned of the dangers of  bureaucracy, of how capitalism mated with ever increasing rationalization  and technological innovation would become a very difficult beast to  control.  He also warned against the subversion of democratic institutions  by powerful non-democratic groups with oligarchic tendencies.  Saul's view  on the triumph of rationalism is also, by the way, influenced by Weber.  So  instead of damning Weber he should be thanking him.  Here we see the  tendency so common among US (and Canadian) intellectuals today of putting  the blame for their perceived crisis on foreign thinkers (usually German or  French) who have some how lead the well-intentioned, but all too trusting  North Americans astray.  Alan Bloom, on the right, was guilty of the same  thing in his The Closing of the American Mind.  In all, this tendency  represents a mixing up of cause and effect.  If you want to look for a  foreign culpret, how about the English Utilitarians who put morally  accepted self-interest and quest for profit in the service of individual  gain above anything else?  An attitude that has since then been  enthusisatically and uncritically accepted by the mass of American  intellectuals.     <br />What is Saul's solution?  Persistent public  commitment by the citizenry can turn the tables on corporatism.  But how,  given the power that Saul says the elites have to manipulate and control  all the spheres of our existence?  What of their ability to define  \\"freedom\\" in wholly consumerist terms, making it a mere matter of material  choice?  As long as the US Constitution allows for majority rule the public  will have the last say, but how to mobilize the public, howto educate them  as to defending their best interests when the reigns of mass communication  are in the hands of the corporatists?  How do we make the interests of  society take priority over the interests of profit?  The moral dilemma in  all this is ignored by Saul who distrusts anyone who even mentions it.   Unable to follow Nietzsche's lead he stumbles.  Nietzsche, alas a  foreigner, was also primarily a moralist.  Morals are important since they  shape the way that we adjust to the struggle for our very existence in an  ever more competitive world.  While a sense of the spiritual is necessary,  the vast bulk of our actions, the reality we must deal with in our every  day lives, is economic due to the pervasive market system which is the very  air we breathe.  It is therefore very much man-made, synthetic, something  that has been grafted onto society, not a component of it.  Morals are as  necessary now as when we lived in small farming communities, since it is by  working together, by accepting each others' strengths and weaknesses, by  learning to control our own impulses and irrational drives and by accepting  the inate worth of each person that we insure not only our own but the  survival of our species in the coming hard winter.  A, \\"myth-building\\"  exercise you say, but is it any more a myth than that of \\"the Market  corrects itself and all we need do is trust in it\\"?   <br />Since the end of  the 18th Century we in the West have lost almost every remnant of our  pre-Capitalist past.  We have forgotten our entire community or social or  human-to-human history, we are unable to recall when an action did not  infer some sort of self-benefit.   We fail to see that the so-called Third  World is as we were two hundred years ago.  It is not a question of  scientific or technological or commercial progress, in the most human  sense, but of the maturing and decay of an idealogical-based social system.   <br />Saul's main drawback is that he lacks the indepth knowledge of the  numerous diciplines necessary for this very complex subject.  That and  `distance' since he approaches the problem with far too many  preconceptions.  A much better book in a related subject is Karl Polanyi's  The Great Transformation.  His history of the market economy provides much  of the background necessary to illuminate our current situation.  Few if  any thinkers today have the breadth of knowledge to provide the big picture  of our current post-modern situation.  Men like Max Weber, who had a  encyclopeadic knowledge of several wide fields of study no longer walk the  earth.  Still a much more refined, yet wide view which would include a  fuller understanding of social economics, history, political science,  sociology, theology and philosophy is necessary in order to get a grip on  the tendencies which are slowly eating away our society and threaten to  turn us all into what Max Weber described as \\"a culture of specialists  without spirit, sensualists without heart\\".	2000-07-03
US	51104090	R3J536AB5A1862	0691019835	206555027	Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist	Books	5	116	126	N	N	A Work of Genius	I found this book to be a great aid in understanding Nietzsche.  Professor Walter Kaufmann does an admirable job describing the evolution of Nietzsche's philosophy, his anti-system yet systematic approach, the will  to power, eternal recurrence and much more.  I recommend reading at least  Beyond Good and Evil before taking this on in order to get a feel for  Nietzsche and his ideas.  <br />Walter Kaufmann was arguably the best  translator of Friedrich Nietzsche into any language and is responsible to a  large extent for his rehabilitation after World War II.  In contrast to  those who attempt to trash Kaufmann (see especially the reviews to Will To  Power) he was better equipped to interpret Nietzsche than the vast majority  of amateur Nietzscheans today.  First Kaufmann was German-born, meaning  that he had a native ability with that language.  Normally when choosing a  translator it is the normal requirement that the target language - in the  case of Nietzsche's German, English is the target language - is handled by  a native speaker.  Kaufmann was an exception to this rule in that his  English was exceptional; his writing is better than most native English  speakers.  In addition to that he had the intuitive feel for Nietzsche's  German that only a native speaker of that language could have.  Consider  too the cultural context.  His generation was closer to Nietzsche's than  ours, he grew up in and knew intimately the culture that had produced  Nietzsche.  With all this in mind, for someone to then come along, say a  30ish American with perhaps a smattering of High School German, and attempt  to trash Kaufmann (all the while using his translations which one would  expect were tainted) shows a distinct lack of intellectual consistency.  In  other words if Kaufmann is wrong, don't rely on his translation, go back to  the original German yourself to make your argument, or give up the effort.   <br />However I expect that the main reason to attack Kaufmann is political.   Today there are those who wish to reclaim Nietzsche for the Nazis even  after Kaufmann decisively demolished the arguments for that connection.   Those who wish to portray Nietzsche as a racist who focused on breeding and  bloodlines ignore what the man actually wrote and betray more about their  own opinions than Friedrich Nietzsche's.  Far from being a proto-Nazi,  Nietzsche in his own words comes across more as the Anti-Hitler or rather  more to the point Hitler was the Anti-Nietzsche.  Is it so surprizing that  German culture was capable of producing both?  Although in Hitler's case, I  find him more a product of the times, than of any particular culture.   <br />Much has been made of the fact of Hitler's fascination with Nietzsche.   As a young soldier he most likely read Zarathustra, which was issued in  mass to German troops in World War I along with the Bible.  Like most  readers who start with that book and read nothing else of Nietzsche, he  understood little of the man's ideas.  As Kaufmann mentions on page 292,  the Nazis got their racial theories not from Nietzsche, but from Hans F.K.  Günther who in turn was greatly influenced by the American racists Madison  Grant and Lothrop Stoddard among others.  Stoddard, a Harvard professor in  the 1920's, is an interesting figure, in a certain perverse way, almost  forgotten today except among white supremacists.  His views (along with  Grant's) on the Germans classified them as racially mixed with only a small  quantity of superior \\"Nordic\\" blood.  One wonders the influence this view  had on Nazi policies and their fanatic and murderous efforts to \\"cleanse\\"  foreign elements from their bloodlines.  In fact Stoddard's influence on  the Nazis clearly outweighs anything they got from Nietzsche, but while  Stoddard is unacceptable today for mass consumption, Nietzsche's appeal  goes on.  Any attempt to link Nietzsche to the Nazis must be seen as the  cheap political fascist trick it is.	2000-06-21

We let the existence of this singular noun influence and cloud our perception of the actual situation,  the cross-purposes and confusion of those times.  Hitler fought wars on  various fronts and also at least one behind the lines, against a people he  had decided to destroy, that great massacre which we call today the  Holocaust.  Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union was undoubtedly the  largest of them all.  Did the strategic bombing of Germany and our  operations in North-western Europe influence the final decision in the  East?  Yes, but it was the actual Soviet victory on the ground which made  the difference.  For that reason both sides deserve an impartial analysis  as far as the operational military history is concerned.  Let's leave the  other considerations aside in this instance.<br />Professor Earl F. Ziemke's  Moscow to Stalingrad: Decision in the East is the second of a planned three  volume set of the US Army's historical series of the Russo-German War.  The  first three chapters of this volume take us up quickly to the failure of  the Wehrmacht's Operation Taifun before Moscow.  The German Army was the  most combat experienced and militarily efficient force in 1941.  It  consisted of masses of good light infantry but only a thin layer of panzer  and motorized troops for long distance movement.  The Luftwaffe too was  designed and equipped to support short swift wars of annihilation.  The  Soviets, on the other hand, hadn't fought competent enemies at all before  1941 except for the Finns and had subdued them only with difficulty.   Ziemke's story actually starts with Chapter 4, where he describes the  Soviet Counteroffensive in detail and the German response to it.  All in  all this is a good operational history of this period of the war put  together overwhelmingly from primary sources.  Here one can read of the  build up forManstein's operations in the Crimea, including the deployment  of `Dora', the most powerful artillery piece in history.  In addition the  book provides good history of Soviet Operation Star, the battles along the  Finnish border and the combat involving Army Group North (including the  capture of Soviet General Vlasov) as well as the German build-up for the  Stalingrad campaign.  The author uses the official unit war diaries  whenever possible for the Germans, but must rely on pre-1991 Soviet  official histories for the Russians.  Due to the sources, the emphasis is  more weighted to the German side, but the author doesn't ignore Soviet  development as he describes the evolution of the reeling Soviets of 1941-42  into the unsure practitioners of the vast mobile operations, which nearly  destroyed Hitler's southern flank in 1942-43.<br />A mention of the situation  with sources is necessary.  Since 1985 when this book was published the  former Soviet archives have partially opened.  While some interesting  information is now available - most importantly perhaps the actual losses  that the Soviets suffered - compiling and analysing documents takes time  and dedication as well as `distance' on the part of the historian.  Ziemke  has a good grasp of the German side in this regard from a decades-long  thorough study of the archival material.  It will be some time yet before  we will have someone with as good a view of the Soviet side, perhaps due to  nothing else but that their archives were kept secret for so long.  The  definitive study of this war has yet to be written, but the last volume of  this set, that covering the period of June 1941 until the failure of the  German drive on Moscow may be the first to combine both the German and  Soviet views objectively.	2000-06-07

Half German, from his mother's side, Sajer feels divided loyalties.  Is he German or French?  To the Germans he's German and thus eligible for military service.  At first his  German is heavily accented and he feels at a disadvantage among the  \\"race-conscious\\" Nazi-indoctrinated German soldiers around him.  Once he  joins an elite division however, he finds himself accepted, except for one  incident during a drunken party.<br />Besides the remarkable descriptions he  gives of his infantry training after joining the elite Grossdeutschland  Division, his participation in the Kursk offensive and fighting partisans  as part of an ad hoc Kampfgruppe is a sense of the panic that gripped the  Germans in 1943-44 as they were forced back out of the Ukraine and towards  Germany itself.  His description of the retreat across the Dnepr as well as  the welcome the survivors received at the hands of the military police  gives a good impression of the incomprehensible fear and shock that almost  overwhelmed the Wehrmacht.  It was only with ever increasingly brutal  methods that the authorities felt that they could keep the men fighting,  keep their army from falling apart.  The best historian of the Wehrmacht,  IMHO, Omer Bartov, has much to say about this and also has some interesting  things to say about Sajer's account, but that should wait until after the  reader has completed this book.	2000-05-31

This book covers the period 1945-53, the years of the Truman Administration and the formation of our modern military/national security sturcture.  Thomas D. Boettcher weaves an interesting story going from  Truman's White House office to the trenches in Korea where outnumbered GI's  fire their last HEAT round at approaching North Korean T-34/85's.  Included  in this fine history are heroes, such as George C. Marshall, Arleigh Burke,  Hoyt Vandenberg, along with my favorite, Matthew Ridgeway, `bad guys' like  Louis Johnson, Frank \\"Rowboat\\" Matthews and of course Joe McCarthy, as well  as epic figures like Douglas MacArthur.  The author's handling of Harry  Truman is balanced.  On page 172 he writes, \\"Truman's . . . personal  attitudes and policies had created a highly charged, polarized enviroment -  these attitudes and policies being, in particular, the President's distrust  of the career military, his dislike for the Navy . . . and his disposition  to keep decreasing already austere military budgets while dramatically  increasing the roles of the US military services in world affairs.\\"   Needless to say that such policies enjoyed broad bipartisan support prior  to the fall of China, after which the Republicans attempted to smear  Truman.  Republican Anti-Communism, which held the party together for so  long, started at that time. <br />At the end of the book however, Boettcher  gives Truman his due.  Towards the end of 1952 during peace talks in Korea,  the President rejected Communist demands that all UN-held prisoners be  mandatorilly repatriated, remembering the fate of the Cossacks at the end  of World War II. Allowing the exchange would have been a politically  expediant decision, but it wouldn't have been Truman.  As the author  concludes on page 404, \\"Still the world is a safer place for Truman having  been Commander in Chief.  Another leader might have been more likely to use  atomic bombs to save the Eighth Army back during that terrible winter of  1950.Truman did not and thereby established the most important precedent  of the cold-war era.\\"<br />What came out most of all from reading this book  was the desire among all those described to do right by the country.  Sure  there was intense interservice rivalry, but there was little hint of the  self-serving \\"cashing in\\" so evident among both US civilian and military  officials today.  Truman and Marshall left government service with little  capital worth enjoying (by today's standards) modest pensions.  Nor did  they worry about landing a cushy job in the private sector upon retirement.   Gone too is any indication of political vision or stature.  Comparing  Truman to the current Reaganist candidate (a scarecrow in comparison) is  only one more indication of how far America has degerated as a functioning  political system answerable to the real needs of her people.<br />Oh, the  answer to my title question?  Harry S. Truman of course.	2000-05-29

By careful  research, crosschecking and comparison with other resources Professor Gross  has been able to produce a work of exceptional clarity and importance in  understanding the workings of Stalinism in particular and totalitarianism  in general.  <br />He provides an outline of Soviet occupation policy and  methods.  The whole process seems to have been well planned out, one phase  setting up the conditions to implement the second, which in turn set up the  conditions for the third, all this operating within an artificial  atmosphere of fear, chaos and confusion.  An initial period of lawlessness,  promoted by the Soviets in order for a rapid collapse of the old order  accompanied by the promoting of ethic hatreds among the four main groups-  Poles, Ukrainians, Belorussians and Jews, was followed by rapid  consolidation of police powers by those who owed their new won power to  Soviet authority alone.  In the process of laying out this interesting  story, Gross adds many interesting insights.  <br />Discussion of social  control, prisons and deportation, NKVD interrogation methods (including use  of female interrogators) and much more provides a well rounded sketch of  this particularly brutal episode of Polish history.  I found his analysis  of the \\"privatization of the public realm\\", \\"the spoiler state\\",  \\"totalitarian language\\", and Soviet use of family networks to insure  discipline and control illuminating.  <br />Actually the only short coming of  this very interesting book is that is was published in 1988 just before the  end of the Soviet Union and thus produced without the use of the since  partially-opened Soviet archives.  He only has limited information on the  Katyn massacres for instance.  While this should not affect his conclusions  or insights, it may give more accurate statistics than those quoted.   Perhaps a new revised edition is called for.  In the meantime, this book  should be a welcome addition to any library on Polish history, Soviet  history or the history of World War II.	2000-05-21

It takes sustained attention, several readings of the most important parts, guidance from supplementary articles, time and interest.  After the required investment, the diligent  reader will come to understand Clausewitz's system and the remarkable way  that it stills aides in understanding the phenomenon of war.  Readers who  know of what I speak will agree that the results of the recent NATO war  against Serbia over Kosova can be explained very accurately in  Clausewitzian terms.   Much has been made of the fact that Clausewitz died  before he could complete the work.  We will never know what added insights  the Prussian philosopher may have been able to come up with or the  additional nuances that he may have added to the framework that he had  established.  While true, this attitude detracts from what he was able to  accomplish.  The only finished portion of the book, Part 1 of Book 1 is  also the most important.  The rest of Book 1, Book 2, Book 3 and Book 8  (the last) are in Bernard Brodie's words, \\"pure gold\\".  The other books  have relevant information for our times too, but one must shift through  much which belongs to the past.   Clausewitz's theory of war considered war  to be \\"a remarkable trinity\\" of rational action (policy), irrational action  (passion) and the play of chance (friction versus genius).  These three  points act as poles above which \\"theory\\" itself is suspended like a magnet.   Alan D. Beyerchen has pointed out that Clausewitz was talking about a  non-linear system in that the course the magnet will take as it hovers  above and in and out of the three fields of attraction produces an  irreproducible trajectory highly sensitive to the initial conditions which  set it in motion.  In addition we have other important concepts such as the  duel nature of war, the importance and uses of theory, friction, war's  psychological element, tactical and strategic centers of gravity, and of  course the primacyof policy over purely military concerns in strategic  planning.  All of these are still of interest today.  Not bad for a work  that was published initially in 1832!<br />One additional note.  I recommend  the Everyman's Library Edition of On War.  First it is the Michael Howard /  Peter Paret translation which is the best in English.  Second it contains  four interesting and enlightening articles by Howard, Paret and Bernard  Brodie and last it is a hard cover book printed and bound in Germany and of  excellent quality.	2000-05-15

Hunted from place to place, cold, filthy and in rags, we wander about like gypsies and in the end are destroyed like vermin!\\"<br />The origin of this  lamentation-- perhaps a victim of the Holocaust?  No, rather an excerpt for  a letter written by a German soldier on the Western Front in November of  1915. I found this book very interesting as far as it went.  Omer Bartov  sets the stage for the argument that the experience of the Great War set  the paradigm which made the Holocaust possible.  Personally I've suspected  this for a long time and Bartov mentions many similarities between trench  warfare and the death camps.  Less pervasive is his description of the  perpetrators as \\"frustrated pacifists\\".  In addition Bartov has interesting  comments concerning the way that industrial killing in general and the  Holocaust in particular are commemorated.  In the end however I thought he  could have carried his main argument further, but all in all a worthwhile  book and definitely needed in this field.	2000-05-07

The context in which the act takesplace, whatever the meaning of the act in and of itself, is one in which men have social, economic, political, and physical power over women. Some men do not have all those kinds of power over all women; but all men have some kinds of power over all women; and most men have controlling power over what they call their women.... The power is predetermined by gender, by being male.  Intercourse as an act often expresses the power men have over women. Without being what the society recognizes as rape, it is what the society-- when pushed to admit it--recognizes as dominance.\\" Quoted from Chapter 7. Interesting.  And I don't doubt that some men need to read this, but hardly an objective truth.  But then is it really meant to be?  Andrea Dworkin is a feminist agitator and theorist, who is one standard bearer of an ideology.  She provides the intellectual bullets and bombs to fire up the troops, to motivate them for \\"the great struggle ahead\\".  In this respect she most resembles the likes of William Bennett, the would-be philosopher of the right, of Reaganism, which is nothing but another ideology, although on much shakier legs intellectually.  Actually I prefer Dworkin to Bennett since she avoids the stench of opportunism which permeates the Reaganists.  Conclusion: If you don't want to read a feminist theorist than perhaps you shouldn't buy this book, just as you should avoid Bennett if you aren't looking for something to reinforce your prejudices.<br />One additional point.  I used quotes from this book in a discussion that I put together for my Proficiency Level English language class.  The class, predominately 20ish Portuguese female college students, rejected Dworkin as too radical and badly in need of \\"balance\\". The question which begs to be asked -- How much of her radical view, setting aside the personal element, is not based on universal sexual roles or relationships, but on US cultural conflict and sex-based animosity?  Perhaps a more in-depth study (real social science not ideology) of how sexual relations are handled successfully in other cultures and the influence of a strong family relationship on female self-esteem are badly needed.  <br />I gave the book three stars; I don't think it's her best.  I liked Right Wing Women more.  END	2000-05-07

Bruce Gudmundsson has served as a Marine Corps officer, as did I, and his study  provides the answers to those many questions that were floating around in  our heads during those cold nights in the woods around Quantico.  The  German Stosstruppen were the originators of the infantry tactics still used  to this day.  Even modern special operations forces can trace their linage  to these small units that formed after the failure of the great Schlieffen  Plan.  It was the decentralized character of the German Army, as the author  points out, that was the true secret of German combat efficiency and  innovation.  Company grade officers were given responsibly for their units'  training following only broad guidelines dictated from above.  Gudmundsson  traces the evolution of the German infantry company and battalion, the  development of new weapon systems and the coordination of infantry and  artillery to maximize offensive operations.  He provides and explains the  original German terms for the various tactical concepts and organizations.   Quotes from the Stosstrupp commander Ernst Jünger and others add an  additional perspective.  The only flaw I see in this otherwise superior  book is the poor quality of the map illustrations, which provide little in  the way of supporting information.  The line and block charts on the other  hand are useful.  It's interesting to note that the reputation of the  Stosstruppen or Sturmabteilungen was so great in Germany after the war,  that the Nazis appropriated the latter term to describe their bands of  uniformed thugs; an irony when considering that the original Stosstruppen  included young German Jews and Poles who were more than ready to die for  their Kaiser.   I think a good companion to this book is the Osprey Warrior  Series, German Stormtrooper 1914-1918 by Ian Drury and Gerry Embleton.This second volume provides photographs and color drawings of the weapons,  troops and equipment discussed along with a bit of supplementary  information.	2000-04-16

At that time the Fritz Fischer  thesis, that Germany's decision on war was a grab for world power, had  considerable appeal.  I've always had problems with that view since it  didn't address the question of why war in 1914, but not in 1905?  Had  Germany really wanted to make short work of Russia and France she could  have done it then with the Russian Army in a shambles after their defeat by  Japan.  War did not come however.   Instead it came nine years later with  Germany in a much weaker strategic situation.  What I think is most  difficult for the reader to do today is to see Europe from the eyes of the  elites who made the decisions in 1914.  The German Army was viewed by many  experts has having considerable flaws, not as the precision mechanism we  preceive today.  Also the European opinion of the Germans was different.   Not too many years before many believed that Germany was unsuited for  industry, that her people lacked the talent to master science and  technology, that they were primarily a simple pastorial people.  For many  British to have thought, as Ferguson shows, that they could win the war  with money alone stems from this.  Also we Americans especially today lack  any feeling for the sense of inferiority and weakness that the Germans felt  towards the French especially.  Germany had been before 1870 a collection  of petty princedoms which had been played off against one another by the  French, British, Swedes and Russians.  Napoleon, still a impressive image  at the beginning of this century, had fought most of his battles in  Germany, moving about the country at will defeating the best armies put up  against him.  Our view today is dominated by what happened after 1914, not  by the history which preceeded it.   This book attempts, in part, to  rectify this.  For balance I recommend G.F. Kennan's The Faithful Alliance:  France, Russia, andthe Coming of the First World War and David G.  Herrmann's The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War. As  far as the attrocity argument goes, Germany's main crime in my opinion was  that they used those  methods, which had up to that point been used only  against aboriginal peoples, against Europeans.  One must remember that the  original lopping off hands and feet stories were based on actual Belgian  attrocities in the Congo.  As to over 5,000 Belgian civilians killed during  the invasion, Admiral Dewey dispatched that many Filipinos during the first  days of our own Philippine-American War in 1899, a war that we instigated  and fought with blatant cruelty.   This brings up the trully controversial  point (from a US perspective) that Ferguson brings up on page 55.  As he  states, &quot;Compared with the US, Germany was a pacific power.&quot;   Stange that none of the reviews have mentioned this.  A comparison of even  our more recent history (Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama in  1989) to the 1914 German actions in Belgium seem to justify the opinion of  Ambrose Bierce, when he wrote, &quot;War has never found us ready.  War has  never found any modern nation ready, excepting Prussia, and her only once.   If we will learn nothing by experience, let us try observation.  Let us  cease our hypocritical cant, rise from our dreams of peace and of the love  of it, confess ourselves the warlike people that we are, and become the  military people we are not.&quot;	2000-01-18

I've found this book to be hard going, not being a sociologist or Weber expert, but with careful reading I've come to get an understanding of Weber's fascinating thought.  I agree with the author that Weber's ideas  are as pertinent now as when they were put down at the beginning of this  century.  Is it because we still haven't come to grips with the basic  problem of dealing with a demystified modern age?  Are you an intellectual  wanting to keep a place for religion in a world dominated by science and  rationality?  Read Weber!  Are you a former Marxist wondering what went  wrong?  Read Weber!  Are you simply looking for answers in dealing with a  political system which seems out of control, unresponsive to the needs of  its own people?  Read Weber!  This book doesn't have full answers to those  questions, but this thinker does.  This book however provides an excellent  overview of Weberian thought, the best book on Weber I've read so far.	1999-08-19

Here is an excellent portrait of America in 1917 with warts and all.  Professor  Kennedy brings many interesting personalities of that time to life  including John Dewey, Randolph Bourne, George Creel and many others.  This  book also contains the only good discussion of economic warfare as waged by  the United States against Germany during 1917-18 that I've come across.   Mitchell Palmer convinced Congress to seize control of thousands of U.S.  chemical patents held by German firms or individuals.  This amendment was  passed on 4 November 1918, just seven days before the armistice.   &quot;Shortly thereafter he sold 4,500 lucrative patents at  bargain-basement rates to the Chemical Foundation, a newly minted creation  of the American chemical industry.  (sound familiar?) The Foundation then  licensed to member firms production rights under the various patents.. .  Palmer provoked the German government to complain that his policies, 'were  designed to destroy Germany's economic existence upon this  continent.'&quot; His handling of the military side, including mobilization  and the Meuse Argonne offensive are also insightful.  His view of Pershing  and the effectiveness of the AEF will rouse some scorn from those who only  wish to read unquestioning tales of American superiority and genius, but  that is as it should be given the actual events.	1999-06-30

This is a  powerful statement coming from a man who once served the Soviet state as an  Army General, a man who as a young officer willingly drove a tank through  ground zero of a nuclear blast.  His informed view deserves more weight in  my opinion than the smug attitudes of comfortable armchair communists in  the West or unrepentant apparaciki in Russia. Leninists will of course hate  Volkoganov for this in that he has shown their bogus saint for what he was  - a cynical opportunist, a close-minded dilitant, operating with but the  fig leaf of a political plan.  What interested Lenin most of all, as shown  by the author, was not the establishment of communism, but rather the raw  use of power.  Thus he could write of the withering away of the state in  &quot;State and Revolution&quot; while at the same time planning the  creation a bureaucraticized police state based on mass terror. Volkognov  sheds amazing light on various aspects of Lenin which until now were little  known, such as his family background, his connections with the German  General Staff, his responsibility for the murder of the Czar and his  family, his actions in the Kaplan affair, and his unrealistic hopes in  spreading the world revolution.  What was for me perhaps the most  frightening aspect of Lenin is how much his style has been copied since  1917 by cynical political manipulators, especially in the West.  The quest  for unrestrained power is for them, as it was for Lenin, the sole reason  for their political existance.	1999-05-22

That one line from Carl von Clausewitz's most famous work, On War, is the most often quoted and perhaps most misunderstood concept that belongs to  the Prussian officer's theory of war.  Clausewitz's ideas are complex and  his writings require study and contemplation to understand, but for those  who invest the time and effort the results will be that your view of war  will change forever.   Professor Paret's book provides a helpful aide to  this understanding.  While Clausewitz and the State is not light reading  and a background in German or at least Napoleanic history is helpful, this  book provides the basis for developing a fuller understanding of Clausewitz  and his concepts. The Clausewitz that Paret introduces is hardly the  stereotype Prussian marinet.  He's a reformer and distinctly modern in his  outlook.  A career officer who joined a line regiment as a cadet at 12, saw  his first action at 14 and rose to the rank of Major General, yet wrote of  the profound sorrow he felt upon leaving home at such a tender age,  Clausewitz put his sense of duty to the state, and by extension the  Prussian people, before his duty to the monarch.   Branded a radical his  career suffered, but he remained true to his convictions.  The General  Staff officers of the 20 July 1944 plot against Hitler can trace the roots  of their decision to him. This book provides an excellent base from which  to start in understanding the thoughts of this trully novel thinker.  I  also recommend a visit to the Clausewitz Page on the web.  Read this book  before you attempt to take on On War.	1999-02-18

Max Weber was a modern thinker who defied categorization.  Was he a philosopher, an historian, a political theorist or a sociologist?  This leads to some confusion as to his message.  For  instance, contrary to what one of the reviews mentions, Weber didn't view  Capitalism as an &quot;iron cage&quot;, but it's modern derivative,  bureaucracy as that cage.  Few people will argue with that comment.   Strangely enough too, as Professor Diggins indicates, the questions that  Weber struggled with one hundred years ago are still very much with us  today.  Could that be because the situation of pre-World War I Germany  burdened as it was with a dysfunctional political system and weak leaders,  yet possessing a strong, vigorous economy and formidable military, is very  similar to the that of America today?  I found the author's discussion of   Weber's problems of reconciling the &quot;ethic of principled  convictions&quot; with the &quot;ethic of responsibility&quot; particularly  timely.  After finishing the book I found myself wanting to know more about  Max Weber's insights into the modern condition.	1999-02-15
