Roger Kimball -- who was among the first male students at Bennington College -- works as an art critic.  Born in 1953, he is a shade too young to have been part of the 60s.   Why did he write a book on an era he wasn't part of, at a time too early for real reflection?  1.) Because he is an arch conservative who draws his weapons from the conservative arsenal: chiefly name-calling, which somehow passes as &quot;wit;&quot;  2.) Because he lacks a sense of history.    Kimball is almost smug about having majored in the Classics in college.  To study the literature of a period, one needs to know something about the period in order to understand why the people reacted as they did; what was beautiful to them; etc.    Kimball understands nothing about the historic roots of the upheavals of the 60s and lays most of the blame at the feet of Norman Mailer.  According to the jacket blurbs, this is a &quot;radical analysis.&quot; It analysizes nothing. Kimball's method is to look at the writings of some figures from the 60s and quote them, along with their speeches and articles about them.  There is no tying together of the words from the past with the state of the present, which is what this book is supposed to be about.	2001-02-09

US	49139219	R2ZU4NN02HSPX0	0880015268	303404799	Home Bistro	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Simoly elegant	I wonder if a reader from Plaino, TX read the same book or if a reader somehow got confused when reviewing Home Bistro?  This is a book in which EVERY RECIPE HAS A SHORT LIST OF INGREDIENTS.  In fact, it is the perfect &quot;last minute&quot; cookbook, which is how veteran author Betty Fussell describes it.  Small in size, it is the perfect book to glance through after a long day at work, sitting on the stool in your kitchen, watching the tv news while trying to figure out how to rest your soul by enlivening your palate.  Fussell's aim is to suggest one dish meals, although she does offer valuable side-dish and wine go-togethers.  And her one-dish meals are not the &quot;hot dish&quot; of Lake Woebegone fame or your mother-in-laws dry macaroni and cheese with a corn-flake topping (yuck!), but imaginative meals that draw on European, New World and Asian traditions.  Let's face, what is more relaxing and more rewarding, 1.) a meal made up of take-aways from the deli where the mayonnaise always tastes suspicious; 2.) a meal made up of convenience food from supermarket boxes; 3.) a meal made from simple and fresh ingredients that can be ready in the time it takes to cook frozen french fries?  For me, three is the answer and that is part of the reason why I like Fussell's book.	2001-01-21

It is also a book for either accomplished cooks or for those who want to become accomplished cooks.  Barabara Tropp is fun.  She writes well and reveals a light and charming personality with a fine sense of humor.  This book is conversational and literate.  It is not filled with photos, so if you are very visual and want to see what the finished product looks like, then this book is not for you.  That is not to say that it isn't handsome.  Recipe titles are set off is a pleasing blue type that is easy on the eyes.    There are informative sidebars that we associate with the best of the teaching cookbooks.  Someone already compared it to the Silver Palate cookbook, but it is also like the works of Julia Child and Elizabeth David: a knowledgeable cook/writer fills you in on secrets that you could waste years in learning the hard way.  One drawback: Tropp suggests that you begin by establishing the China Moon pantry.  This takes a bit of dedication.  The plus side of doing this is that you have all the ingredients ready and they can be used in other styles of cooking by today's eclectic cooks.	2001-01-21

I was working on a master's degree in English in Detroit and had just met the man that I would marry.  Sigh! How I wish that I had listened more carefully to Atwood.  I would have run from that!  The Edible Woman is broadly humorous -- the heroine works for Seymour Surveys -- and very much a girls night out.  Funny, perhaps slightly dated, it is a warning to listen to your inner voice.  I seldom read more than one or two books by an author.  The next book from Atwood's pen that I read, Surfacing, turned me off to her for many years.  However, during that time, her reputation as a writer grew.  When I finally picked her up again, I was glad I did.  Atwood has grown into one of the major voices in 20th century literature and will, most likely, continue to be heard into the 21st century.	2001-01-02

Based on a fairy tale idea, this is a thoroughly contemporary novel by one of the great satirists of all time.  This novel lives -- not only is Atwood's city of Toronto magnificently and accurately depicted here -- but the characters are all women that we might have known.  The central character -- oh, dear, who is the central character, is it the professor Toni who narrates the book and seems so much like Atwood herself -- or is it the focus Zenia, the perfect woman who seems so model-like, so tall, so slender, so  hip, so intelligent?  Anyway, this is a book about allusions.  The Robber bride is based  on the idea of the Robber Bridegroom, the evil fairy tale character who murders his wives.  Zenia is completely other than she seems.  Far from perfect.  Far from accomplished.  A myth.  This is a book to read now if you haven't read it already and then to reread in about five years.  I think it is time for my second reading!	2001-01-02

First of all, this is a scholarly book. However, just because it is  academic does not mean it is dull.  Far from it.       Georges Duby was one  of the leading historians/social theorists of the 20th century.  Most of  his career was spent in the south of France but when he was finally lured  to Paris, his lectures were so popular that people waited in line to obtain  tickets to hear the good professor.  Professor Duby's was a long a fruitful  career.        His concerns were with the economics of the early Middle  Ages and the records of the Counts of Guise in northern France.  From the  patterns of marriage of these ambitious men, Duby found the beginnings of  the marriage practices of today.  Duby shows how these ambitious men  manipulated pedigrees and married and discarded wives in order to increase  their wealth and power. Love had nothing to do with it.      Like many  French histories, this one is not burdened with footnotes.  It originated  in a series of lectures that Duby gave in this country, which probably  accounts for the streamlined presentation of material.  I think it is an  important book for legal historians, but its value would not be lost on  feminists or Francophiles and people who love the Middle Ages.	2000-08-03

Although the sun has set on the British Empire, a peculiar sort of English genius for analyzing  and explaining history emerged after WWII. It is a genius that flowered  because of television.  Michael Wood, trained as an historian at Oxford  (note that the flyleaf of his book on the Trojan War says his master's  degree is in 20th century history while Maryland Public Television claims  he was trained as a medievalist), is the latest in a line of charismatic  English (his surname ought to be Anglo-Saxon) telehistorians. He is both  scholar and journalist.       My introduction to Michael Wood was through  his series, &quot;In Search of the Trojan War,&quot; in which Wood began as  a sort of detective, looking for the people and places behind Homer's epic,  and, who, along the way, taught the public- television-public a great deal  about history and archaeology and how computers can be used by  practitioners of both disciplines. Although there does not seem to be a  video tie-in with Wood's latest book, this is, essentially, a book for the  public-television-public: educated, curious people who don't mind the  felling of an idol or two.  It is well-written and witty, erudite but not  overbearingly so.        This is not a book for people who want a quick,  general overview of history.  Wood seemed to have two purposes: to examine  what it means to be English at the present time and to look into the myths  that have made England England.  Which means that it is also not a book for  the legions of New Agers, the Celtic Revivialists and sentimental  spiritualists of any stripe. He is, however, fair to both Celticists and  Anglo-Saxonists: he can find neither an historic Arthur nor an historic  Robin Hood.      We need populizers: people like Wood with specialized  training in a discipline who can bring their knowledge to a wide audience.   I was trained as an historian at Harvard, where a professor answered the  question, &quot;Do you think Arthur lived?&quot; with the story of  Dunstan's finding of Arthur's tomb complete with lead placque at  Glastonbury. It is perhaps important to the future of the English nation  that people not believe that the body of a tall man and his blonde wife  were found in a remote abbey in the Middle Ages.  It is important that we  know exactly who Alfred the Great really was.      It is also important  that our current charismatic English telehistorian is a real scholar and a  gentleman with a fine sense of humor.  Read this book.	2000-08-02

With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre.  About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it  before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the  discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience.  So did  another.  We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still  only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre  was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the  book, we knew it.  Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of  the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her.  George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th  century.  While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit,  Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome.  I can not get into Dickens or  James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap  between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no  one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.<br />  That is not to say that the plot holds up.  It is riddled with  co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions.  However, her  characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not.  So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of  dead white European males.  Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our  thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte  Bronte is part of the Western canon.	2000-07-28

However, I picked up the book because the very title addressed 1.) the basic reason why I became a feminist of my own sort;  2.)something frightening that I noticed as late as 1972.     1.)During the  late 1950s, alcoholism among women -- no, make that housewives because the  concern was not for all adult females -- began to be a theme in women's  magazines and in private conversations.  Women, bored and lonely in their  homes, were falling prey to Demon Rum.  On the other side of the fence, men  were dying too young of heart attacks because as the sole breadwinners they  were far too stressed.  The call went up for a new synthesis: another way  of approaching the family and its income.  Co-incidentally or perhaps not  so co-incidentally, Simone de Beauvoir and Betty Friedan published their  essays on women. The first wave of Baby Boomers went to college, convinced  that their's would be a life different than their parents: those who wanted  to be married were positive that each wife and each husband would find  part-time jobs and would share the tasks of child-rearing equally.  That,  for many women of my generation, was feminism and we became that kind of  feminist in order not to end up tippling at the kitchen table.        2.)  Once all those Baby Boomers had their degrees in hand and were working or  in graduate school, it seemed that friends would sometimes fall from the  ranks.  Where was Karen? Linda? Diane?  In mental hospitals.  If we ever  knew a male mental patient, he was always a total whacko, but Karen was  successfully pursuing a ph.d in English and Linda had a wonderful baby and  a husband who adored her and Diane's career was blossoming.  Do you catch  my drift?  Women who seemed normal, who had every reason to go on with what  seemed like productive and happy lives ended up in hospitals but there  never seemed to be a male population of mental patients.I found Carol  Warren's book helpful in addressing the issues of women and alcoholism and  other social ills of the 1950s and in answering the still lingering  concerns about people like Linda and Karen and Diane.     As for the  previous reviewer from Kansas who was irritated by this book: in Kansas,  they're still doing battle with Charles Darwin.	2000-07-25

After all, should we trust a book more suitably sized for the coffee table than for the kitchen counter?  But my mistrust was misguided. The food is wonderful.  All people have  assumptions about &quot;others,&quot; and one of the assumptions Americans  make about the French is that their food is very difficult to prepare and  relies on expensive ingredients.  The truth is that French food need not be  difficult and that it is a cuisine that recognizes the beauty of each  season.  Since my children bought this book for me, we have been building  seasonal rituals around it.  For example, we get salt anchovies from the  neighborhood Italian deli for our Christmas eve appetizer. At Mardi Gras,  we make the oreilles found in this book, which are the pastries sold as  &quot;pig's ears&quot; or &quot;angel wings&quot; in the last days before  Lent by Polish bakeries in Detroit.  Depending on the bakery, they were  known as &quot;pig's ears&quot; or &quot;angels wings.&quot;  My only  criticism of the book is that I feel the need to keep it open in the dining  room, lest kitchen grease spoils it.	2000-07-21

I had never heard of grappa but I knew I wanted to copy that  recipe and so I bought the companion book for the series.  Many years  later, La Cucina di Lidia crossed my hands and I'm glad it did. And not  just for the recipes, which are superb. Lidia and I are the same age.   While I grew up is a working class suburb in the American Midwest,with its  small lots ringed by chainlink fence, Lidia grew up in a country still  scarred by WWII.  We were not wealthy -- my father, who never went to high  school, was a skilled laborer -- but we never had the sort of struggle to  put food on the table that Lidia's family had.  That struggle and the story  of her families immigration is told in this cookbook.  And, yes, it is a  cookbook, but it is just as interesting as a document of perhaps the  &quot;other side&quot; of the Baby Boom generation that has been soundly  criticised for materialism and self-indulgence. From generations of Istrian  cooks, Lidia learned how to feed a family suberbly.  To my Irish and Polish  family, the Italian dishes that were making their way into the Midwest in  the 1950s were exotic.  I remember my mother buying the &quot;spaghetti  kit,&quot; (can I mention the brand - Chef Boyardee) a yellow, rectangular  box in which there was a long, thin box of dry spaghetti, a medium size can  of tomato sauce and a small can of grated cheese. When there were only 2  children in the family, we were fed from one box, but as the children grew  in size and increased in number, so did the number of boxes it took to feed  the family.  It was with considerable trepidation that my mother bought her  first pound of dry pasta and cans of whole tomatoes and tomato paste and  made her first &quot;Italian&quot; dinner from scratch. More than red  sauce, this is a wonderful book that captures an era and an area. Bythe  way, Lidia also answers the question of dry v. &quot;fresh&quot; pasta.  A  great book.	2000-07-20

I agree with the latter.  I have  come to the conclusion that Simone's own diligence sometimes brought her to  her knees. This was a woman capable of working for hours on end. . .and  drinking just as hard. Clearly, she was ambivalent about herself:she knew  she was of superior intelligence -- she finished her aggregation at the age  of 21 -- yet she maintained a position that she was second to Sartre.  She  said that she never felt handicapped as a woman and yet she suffered from  many of woman's woes -- crying and jealousy.        I started with Simone's  war-time memoirs -- Force of Circumstance -- which are so riveting that  they draw you immediately into them.  I expected the same sort of lush and  wonderful writing here.        I may have approached this volume with my  hopes too high. A word of warning: Catholicism obviously made quite an  impact on the young Simone.  Readers who are not Catholic maybe mystified  by this book.	2000-07-20

First of all, the recipes in this book are complex -- but -- there  are books that are much more challenging.  Haute Mexican and Japanese  cuisine are more difficult, the first because it grew out of a class  culture where the food was cooked by maids the second because it is so  unlike western food. There are things in this book that are exotic, even to  Bostonians where &quot;the Italian North End&quot; was made such an imprint  on the city.

It brought back memories.  Growing up, my best friend from the fifth grade through college was the daughter of a French war bride.  Although her  father worked for Ford Motor Company, like many of the father's in my  suburban neighborhood, their family was different.  One of the strangest  differences was the way my friend's mother treated stomach upsets. In our  family, like most of the families in the area, we would be given a glass of  Vernor's Ginger Ale.  My friend's mother administered small glasses of  Chartreuse.  After Elizabeth David and Colette conspired to infuse a love  of all things French in my character, I began to collect books about  France, hence the gift.  How wonderful to read this cookbook from a  wonderful auberge in the neighborhood of the grand old monastery of  Chartreuse.

Elizabeth David went to France in the still dark days following WWII -- an English friend told me that meat was rationed in Britain until 1953 -- to earn a master's degree in romance languages and discovered that there was a  way to prepare food undreamed of in still wartorn England.  I bought  the book nearly a quarter of a century ago in a tiny, independent  bookstore, a white-painted, uninsulated building with flowers growing all  around it, in a resort town in NH.  I took it back to where I was staying  and read it avidly: if you don't cook, it is a wonderful evocation of  French life in a simpler time, before Robert Mondavi tried to buy vinyards  in Langue d'Oc.  I am still reading it, although the original book, stained  and darkened with age, has been replaced.  It may sound dramatic to say  that it changed my life but I think it did.  Elizabeth made me think of  food and France in a different way.  The next time I returned to that  bookstore, I bought a novella by Colette.

US	49139219	R3LGLY3CRDK4XJ	0375700757	11590154	Cold Mountain: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	TWO PEOPLE _DREAMING TOGETHER	Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain is an amazing first novel.  His characters are rich and real. An updated telling of Homer's Odyssey, Frazier, like his Greek forefather, reaches into mythology to show how the characters are  more than their physical selves: they are points in history, the  fulfillment of centuries of social and political events, religious beliefs  and personal destinies and dreams.       Inman, the hero, is more than a  reluctant soldier and more than an avatar of Odysseus.  Walking home after  recovering from his war wounds instead of returning to battle, he marks the  beginning of the counter-mythology of war: the soldier who is disallusioned  with the cause for whom there is only guts and no glory.        Interestingly, the woman he longs for, Ada, is also something new.  She  foreshadows the liberated women of the 20th century.  By allowing herself  -- the daughter of an aristocrat fallen on hard times -- to be taught by  lower class Ruby, she learns the value of work and stewardship of the land.   Cultured and well-educated, she allows her sensuality to come to the fore,  making her truly worthy of Inman's trek home to her.       Some readers  have been disturbed by the use of mythology and folk music, but once they  learn that old traditional songs, like &quot;Three Ravens&quot; in which a  pregnant woman in the guise of a doe comes upon her fallen husband, are  woven through the book and serve to foreshadow events within it, they  become more accepting of the improbable elements.       During the first  broadcast of Ken Burns' &quot;The Civil War,&quot; the point was made that  if anything would have created an American epic, it would have been that  conflict.  At the time, I said that we are not a people who rely on epic  poetry and ours is no longer an oral culture; therefore, it is not  surprising that there has been no American epic.  In the 20th century, we  use the cinema to spread our mores and ideas and tell our stories, so that,  forgood or bad, the epic of the Civil War was Margaret Mitchell's  &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; and its cinematic adaptation.         However, what Frazier has done is simultaneously look backwards -- to Homer  and the beginnings of Western civilization -- and stand in the present --  by borrowing the technique of magical realism and apply this to the  American Civil War.  He retells an event in American history and honors  19th century American culture through the inclusion of ballads and  folktales. Mitchell wrote a &quot;rippin' good yarn,&quot; but Frazier  showed how the Civil War changed America and defined this country for the  20th century and he did it by being respectful of our greater cultural  heritage.       He also created a wonderful love story, of two people,  separated by circumstances that ultimately were not beyond their control  who were able to fulfill their dreams of each other. Frazier may have  redefined what an epic is and he produced a love story that is stronger and  more romantic than the tale of Scarlet and Rhett.      By the way, if  anyone is interested in the sort of music Charles Frazier carried in his  head while writing Cold Mountain, American musician extraordinaire Tim  O'Brien recorded the songs of Cold Mountain.	2000-07-19

Once, a friend was poking in my kitchen bookcase and asked, &quot;Is there such a thing as simply French food?&quot;  Yes!  I read this book and  Elizabeth David's books many time during the first years of my first  marriage and both gave me a basis for preparing delicious and non-fussy  meals for my family.  My only criticism of this book is that vegetable  section is weak.	2000-07-19

In the intervening years, I came to know Helen  Wentz, the &quot;American Quaker&quot; who was one of Simone's pen-pals,  and Nelson Algren but remained blissfully ignorant of the fact that Simone  and Nelson were once lovers until recently.  I happened upon a volume of  Simone's memoirs, Force of Circumstance, decided to read them to research a  project of mine and came away awed by her writing ability.Driven by the  need to understand this complex woman, I decided to reread her favorite  book.       Yes, it is repetitive, but the story is that she wrote and  researched it very quickly.       Yes, it is dated.  However, sometimes  there is genius in stating the obvious. Freud's genius was in reminding the  world that humans are composed of the conscious and the unconscious.  We  knew that: we simply had to be reminded of it. A more recent example of  that kind of genius is Jared Diamond's book &quot;Guns, Germs and  Steel.&quot;   Sometimes, genius consists in opening the debate.  An  example of that sort of genius was Henri Pirenne's work, which I believe is  called &quot;Charlemagne and Mohammed.&quot;  Although it is generally held  that Pirenne's speculations are wrong, in order to challenge them,  generations of scholars discovered and rediscovered much about the Middle  Ages.       In The Second Sex the genius of Simone de Beauvoir was to state  the obvious and to open the debate that led generations of scholars to  learn and relearn much about women.       As the 20th Century drew to a  close and pundits began drawing lists of most influential people and books,  Simone and The Second Sex appeared on all of the lists.  It was well  placed. The  book needs to be read today not as history but as philosophy,  argument and document.  Where would we all be without it?	2000-07-18

Butterfly	I hated this book, partly because I found the writing style pedestrian, but mainly because I thought it had already had a successful life as Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind.  There is, of course, the  long-standing question of whether male authors can and do depict female  characters accurately. (I've not seen the obverse of that situation. Has  anyone been part of a debate as to whether female writers succeed in  getting under the skins of their male creations?) Did I think the American  male author gave us an authentic Japanese female voice?  No. She had about  as much life as a fifth-grade math problem: if one train starts in San  Francisco, travelling at 50 mph...      I realize that the Geisha of the  title begins as a child but she remains a child throughout.  There is no  maturation and no charm in her character.      Furthermore, I detested the  use of coincidense in this book and the  interesting thing for me  personally about my own rejection of this novel is that I have spent long  hours puzzling over the coincidences in my own life and yet I hated the  melodramatic coincidence found here. The whole thing was silly.	2000-07-18
US	49139219	R2PF92ACGCKZR1	0679731725	247754060	The Remains of the Day	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Young author transcends time and space	Ishiquro was born long after the events that inspired this novel passed into history.  It is amazing that a man so young -- and native to another part of the world -- could capture so richly and so well England before,  during and immediately after the war.  It is also interesting that a person  of Japanese descent would chose to examine the English reaction to the  &quot;other&quot; enemy of World War II: Germany. Ishiquro's butler is a  man without emotions and perhaps without thought.  He is unable to relate  to his father and to the nubile housekeeper.  Was he in love with her as  other reviewers have stated?  Probably not.  I think that the point that  Ishiquro may be making in his novel is that one must feel, have emotions,  if one is to think. The butler relates to no one and so is left behind, a  relic of another time and another social system.  He is an automaton in a  living museum.	2000-07-18

Can one really give an award to a novel?  The winner of a race is usually easy to spot, but how can a novel win an award?  In the case of The  Mandarins, the merit may have been due to the depiction of the political  fragmentation of France immediately after the War.  Simone de Beauvoir was  bitterly disappointed that France did not emerge as an authentic world  power with the coming of peace.  The division within the country, however,  was more painful to her than France's diminished stature.  During the War,  some of the factionalism of that country with more than 260 kinds of cheese  abated somewhat, but peace meant a return to acrimony.       Most of  Simone's fiction is based on her life and the people in it.  However, no  character is ever a one-to-one representation of any individual. To say  that the fictional Anne is Simone and Anne's husband is Jean-Paul Sartre is  to over-simplify for Simone invested some of her personality traits in both  characters. The correspondance between Anne and Simone is greatest when  Anne falls in love with the American known as Lewis. (Lcarver of Florida  thought this was the weakest part of the novel and I heartily disagree.  I  knew Nelson Algren.  I think Simone wanted to love him but there were many  reasons why she never fully allowed herself that luxury.)  Once Anne meets  Lewis, Simone's writing becomes freer and more relaxed.  Simone desperately  needed an editor, someone who would have sent the manuscript for the  Mandarins back to her with orders to tighten.  It may have been that by the  time she wrote The Mandarins, she was an embryonic sacred monster.      One  of my criticism's of Simone as a novelist is her 19th century habit of  acting as the omniescent author.  It is annoying when Anne smiles knowingly  or Lewis nods sleepily.  The young Simone (aged 10) read and admired Louisa  May Alcott -- who had more in common with Simone than most Americans might  suppose -- and Louisa loved melodrama.  So did Simone.  In fact, her novel,  &quot;She Came to Stay,&quot; has been criticized as being melodramatic.   Toril Moi, who has written a study of Simone called &quot;The Making of an  Intellectual Woman,&quot; says that book is melodramatic because  existentialism is a melodramatic philosophy.         There is more than a  bit of melodrama to The Mandarins.  It is a shame that the fine writing of  which Simone was capable -- America Day by Day and Force of Circumstance --  didn't transfer to her novels.	2000-07-18

How many women, involved in a  triangle, have wanted to eliminate their rival?  While Simone left her real  life rival unharmed, her alter ego Francoise murders her rival.  Based on  the trio well-known to readers of Simone's memoirs, this is a flawed but  still enjoyable work.  First of all, it is a little too quotidian.  We know  that Simone was a work-a-holic who parceled out her day into writing and  confering with J-P, but that sort of lifestyle is too accurately portrayed  in this novel.  Second, there seems to be a basic flaw in the  &quot;plot,&quot; that arises from the basic situation of the Sartre-de  Beauvoir shared life and that is while both Francoise and Pierre can excuse  their own sexual explorations, when their protege Xaviere exercises her own  FREEDOM OF CHOICE (remember that slogan from the 60s? Not to choose is to  choose?  That was Sartre.), her elders discipline her.  Why does Simone, a  woman with impeccable philosophical credentials, contradict her own  ontology?  At the same time, this book accurately portrays some very real  human emotions.	2000-07-17

This book is fun.  We think of Simone as the woman who initiated  the second wave of feminism with her book, &quot;The Second Sex;&quot; as  the companion of Jean-Paul Sartre, a man plagued by lobsters and his own  sense of self; as the globe-trotting political activist.  Some may know her  as the author of the frightening novel, &quot;She Came To Stay.&quot; The  Simone who wrote this book was the best part of Simone de Beauvoir.  The  book is a snapshot of America, entering the center stage of world power,  taken by a native of a country whose time of leadership has passed.  It is  also the story of a middle-aged woman falling in love. This book was  unavailable for many years but it is important both as a view of America in  mid-century and as an insight into one of the most important women of the  20th century.	2000-07-17
