I wonder if any of the critics so raving actually read it. I wonder how much history or even militery knowledge any of them might have beyond watching a few JAG episodes.  <br /> <br />This is the awful type of book I have come to loath, an  unrealistic sci-fi set in the past. A modern carrier battle group falling into the past to 'save the day', why not the starship Enterrise?  <br /> <br />I should not have been suprised that this book is awful by the choice of whom the carrier was named for.  <br /> <br />Certainly all this book proves is that though the technowlogy of the past was inferior, the brains were much better.   <br /> <br />'Sexist' and 'racist' attitudes of the past so eagerly condemned can only be matched in brainlessness as tThe Politically Correct attidudes   the elite espouse here in the present. <br /> <br />I put this one back on the shelf.  <br /> <br />Not worth buying.	2005-07-15

Clair was to prove less than half a century later. And British ineptness must be deemd the primary cause.  <br /> <br />Gearge Washington and the British learned from their mistakes and went on to win the war. The French failed to learn from their victory and lost, even though to the North, under one oftheir own Generals, they too committed a similar blunder and suffered defeat, which would make another nice book.  <br /> <br />Rene Chartrand gives a good build up to the conflict and describes the action quite well. Especially in regards to the blundering of the British in battle. He also describes the forces and their relative strengths and weaknesses well. <br /> <br />However, though he mentions the Indians, he fails to name the tribes, which mars otherwise excellant work.	2005-05-02

This book had a lot of potential, but fails everywhere. The story feels plotless and plodding to a dull beat. He provides nothing with which the reader can feel or identify with the time period. The characters are poorly written. The frenchman does not feel french. The scot does not feel scotish. None of the characters have any depth because the author doesn't give them any room in which to grow before the reader or the attention they need. And the author wanders too much over the pages. Literally runninig a historical tour through the period at light speed, without giving the reader any time to feel or see what is going on. Indeed, the reader is given very little to see. No descriptions of the area, people, cloths, dwellings or anything of any kind. A few brief parts make nice short stories, but that is the best that can be said of this book.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-24

Most informative about the fortified towns the French built in New France. I found it peticularly interesting since no other work on the subject exists. Quebec and Louisbourg being historic sights of American military history have always facinated me. Well illustrated and well detailed for the novice to read and understand.  <br /> <br />However, no critic is truly satisfied, and I have my wants.  <br />1. I wish the author had illustrated and detailed the cannons the French used for their fortifications. <br /> <br />2. I wish he had provided a map of the continent showing where the cities are. <br /> <br />3. The author illustrated the outlying forts of Montreal, ( fort Senneville, fort de la Montagne, and fort Longeuill), I wish he had done similar work with the Louisbourg Royal Battery and Island Battery, rather than use period illustration. Just as I wish he had detailed a few of the bastions and provided a map showing the relaiton of the fortifications to each other.  <br /> <br />This is a must for anyone interested in this period. <br /> <br />Now if the author could go on and do a sequel of French forts of North America with Fort Duqusne, Fort Niagare, Fort Carrillon (Ticonderoga). Perhaps also the English forts such as Fort Pitt and Fort William Henry.	2005-04-23

I regret I payed so much for it even though it was on sale. Fortunatley, a used book store offered me a good trade. <br /> <br />Poorly written and quite booring. Ten years of research may have provided the author with ample facts to assemble. but he should have spent more time developing a style with which to write it.

Somehow the meaning felt true while reading this book.     <br /> <br />From the little boy who was beaten by nazi teachers because his father was Jewish, to the little girl whose Jewish father fled to America but sent divorce papers to his gentile wife, the stories here are in many ways far from pleasant. But not all the perpetrators are from the same group. A husband kicked out of the nazi party because of his wife's heritage, balanced against that of a girl kicked out of the BDM because of her heritage, only to discover after moving into in her new town the local BDM leadress telling her she was going to be in the BDM whether she liked or not 'unofficially'. A girl whose policeman father was driven mad by the stress and murdered by the T4 fiends to the loss of so many Jewish relatives by each, this is a very insightful book.  <br /> <br />Life was not happy for these women when they were girls. Being prevented form joining the BDM because of their heritage or kicked out if the BDM found out.  Being kept out of many things. Being stuck in the middle of nazi germany with less than politically correct heritage under allied bombs.  Somehow they survived to tell their stories.  <br /> <br />I didn't think it was up the the standards of Hitler's Jewish Soldiers, but that book drew from a larger pool of individuals.  <br />But within its small scale, it's pretty good.	2005-04-14

The period in which it is set is too terrible and many of the misdeeds described are too terrible to speak of.  <br /> <br />But the Joy in this work, the proverbial Silver Lining is there were good people during this period. Many of whom happily risked their lives for strangers. Opening thier pockests and their homes to the hunted with no expectation of rewards of any kind. Some of these heroes were actually anti-semites who drew a line within thier own souls to do good for those they did not like. Just as many of the villeins were mercenaries who did what they did for just money, not caring who thier victims were. And the Author admits he can not tell the stories of all these heroes but just the few mentioned here.  <br /> <br />Besides the noble deeds of the great humanitarian scoundrel Oskar Schindler, who so reminds me of the hero of the Film The Music Man, and the simple Dutch farmsers the Bogaards who turned their farm into a sanctuary hiding Jews from the Dutch police, We hear of an SS man who hides a Jewish inmate from one of his superiors in Dachau. A gypsy family who hides a Jewish Girl. Nuns and priests who hid Jewish children. So many risked their lives and liberty for strangers. And many paid for those lives with thier own. So many heroes, just not enough to do any real effective damage to the beast at work. <br /> <br />It is good to know some good people did exist during these evil times, and that is the joy of this book.   <br /> <br />I must also say I do not like the Israili supreme court changing their designation from Righteous Gentiles to Righteous Persons. <br />It cheapens these heroes and prevents the casual observer knowing the full extent of their nature. There are Men. There are Women. And then there are 'persons'.	2005-04-13

Neo nazi revisionists fregquently mentioning it along with the acts of various Jewish kapos and collaborators for use to trivialize the Holocost. All of which is morally repugnant to me. As repugnant as mentioning the Confederacy's Judah Benjamin to justify anti-semitism in the US which the nazis did before world war two. <br /> <br />This book does not give these people any material.   <br /> <br />What the author reveals and details is that for all Hitler and his cronies neo pagen and new age insanity, they readily employed men of ancestry they loathed, mostly as cannon fodder, and perahps to kill them off in battle rather than send them off to the gas chamber later. Often to bizar lengths with the rules they  created swith their crackpot minds. The author describes these men well and in great detail far greater than Alan Abrams, especially in regards to Werner Goldberg.  <br /> <br />This is their story. And he describes it well. <br /> <br />These men faught for Hitler. Bled for him. Some died for him, while he planned to have them sent to the gas chambers or sterilized once he finished off their full Jewish relatives. <br /> <br />After the war, they got to be treated to bigotry by the Jews who survived who saw them as not Jewish enough to care about, or never let them forget the master they had served.  <br /> <br />He also mentions the notorious Stella Goldschlag, the Gestapo's best Jew Catcher, who helped the nazis catch hundreds of her co-religeonists to send to the camps to murder in her place. Though he does not mention that there were many Jews among the Fascists of europe, such as Italy's facists, the Dutch NSB, the British Fascist Union, and in France. <br /> <br />A must read.	2005-04-08

But I am glad I did not.  <br /> <br />Though I doubt he understates any of the crimes committed within, I absolutely doubt his conclusions.  <br /> <br />If the German people were so virulantly anti-semitic, why did the government ship Jews off to Poland, Riga and Minsk to murder them when it would be much much cheaper to ship them to Germany, to places like Madhausen and Dachau to gas them there? <br /> <br />Whydid they go to such great lengths avoiding population areas so none would see the trains and their pitiful human cargoes despite the extra costs? <br /> <br />With a war going on and rolling stock necessary to keep the armed forces alive and the factoreis going, why did the government waste so much rail resources?  <br /> <br />Why if the German people were so anti-semitic did the government go to such great lengths at keeping knowledge of their attrocities from them? Why not publicly announce their work? <br /> <br />Yes the average young Hitler Youth was well indoctrinated, but most attrocities against the Jews were perpetrated by the adults who were not educated under the nazi system. <br /> <br />Yes Hitler and his crowd were fanatical monsters and the guards and murderers beasts. <br /> <br />But the author has not proven this in the average german despite his efforts at such. <br /> <br />One can just as easily find similar facts to 'prove' the American people hate children in this day and age.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a waste of money.

And the conclusions are hard to accept since Britain was demoralized from France and very low on ammunition and the Germans were very good. Once the Krauts are across, they live off the land and can be supported by air. Once the panzers are across and first armored division done in it's over. It would have been as messy as Crete, but the result would still be the same.  <br /> <br />Personally, I doubt Hitler really planned to do it.

And when he finished, he loaned it to me to read. <br /> <br />I must admit my disapointment. The background information, especially in regards to early Luftwaffe drop tanks and German radar is very good. And I enjoyed Mr. Spick's vision of a carrier fight between Kriegsmarine and Royal Navy.  Very good. <br />However, I find myself disagreeing with the author on most parts. Killing off Goering would hardly effect the Luftwaffe. Like the rest of Germany's armed forces the problem was Hitler. Killing him off would have done much to improve Germany's potential. Indeed, such was Hitler's propensity for picking bad leaders but good cronies, he would undoubtedly have picked poor Udet to replace Goering. Luftwaffe problems would have hardly changed with Goering's demise under Udet. Another problem with the book is the Dornier 19 which was no B17. And even if it were prefected for service, the author fails the next hurdle, providing a long range fighter for the new long range bomber. The Messershmitt 109 just does not have the range, even with a  working drop tank. One need only look to the American expereince over Scweinfort to see what the Luftwaffe would have suffered over Russia.  <br /> <br />The research is good, but the follow through fails. <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-04-08

I susppect the Eurowhining about how people should be Government tax sheep who exist only for them to fleece might explain some of it, but he really does forget things, especially about Americans.      1. The author goes to great lengths to say what litttle in taxes americans paid but forgets what little cash the British empire allowed americans to circulate, always shipping it home and sending letters  of credit to sop what else was on hand. Because of that we were basicly a barter economy.    Paper money was all we had, redeamable in each other's debts.    2. He forgets that after the French and Indian wars, many Americans like Benjamin Franklin actually expected we would have direct representation in Parliment. Brits refused, possibly because of one little study of his. Apparently American women had more children. Families of ten were usual.Families of with twenty five kids were not unheard of. The population doubled every twenty years. And then there was immigration. Apparently the Brits figured in time America would own Parliment, as most of the population would come to live here.    Taxation without Represenation was our grievance. No place in Parliment for Americans than no right of Parliemnt to tax Americans.    3. He forgets things like the Iron Act which prohibeted Americans from developing the vast resources of our land to our own enrichment.     4. He forgets that many Americans saw in the ENCLOSURE ACT the future of things to come from Britain.  What was going on in Britain was merely what would come our way soon. And then there was what was going on in Ireland. Many displaced Englishmen and Irish were coming across the waters to settle, having been literally driven off their own homelands.      I suppose we could all blaim this all on Clive. When he pillaged India without  having to do anything for the locals. Just attack take over and tax the stuffing outof everything and everyone. Treat the locals like dirty savages. He certainly showed the way to Parliment and the Crown. The way of conqest. The way of exploitation. The opium wars of China and the Concentraiton camps of South Africa.    We Americans just didn't care to be treated this way, and were willing to fight.	2005-01-04

So I shall evaluate it as  such.<br />I liked that the author gave the caliber, bore, weight and barrel length of the British naval guns. (This information is readily available in most books on the subject). But I am a little bit peeved that he forgot to give the same information on the artillery for the French and Spanish navies. Though this may be in the next book of the series.  At the same time I am a little bit bemused that he forgot the name for the long barreled musket used by the french, F 1, shown on page 31. It is called a Buccanneer. <br />I shall keep my full judgement until after I have seen the entire series.	2004-06-14

That the word of Five Justice's on the United States Supreme Court can over ride the express written word of all the Founding Fathers and all the American People. To know that what happened in Germany is not unique to any specific land.  <br />However what really shocks me is not all the innocewnt blood the German Judiciary helped spill. Being involved with every aspect of the Nazi state. They were even represented at the Wannsee conference. What really shocks is is that after the war all the nazi judges lawyers and Law professors got their  jobs back. Not one was executed by the allies, despite all that blood. And then they covered for the murderers. Many times revictimizing the victims of nazi persecution or genocide.<br />If this book proves anything it is that in any country an independent judiciary is a hungry fox with a key to the Chicken coop.  And should be done away with.<br />One need only look at this country, whose courts in the past few years have systematicly through 'Evolving' Standards (LIE)begun replacing the Bill of Rights of our Founding Fathers with a Liberal Bill of Lies. With 'Cruel and Unusual Punishment' they try to abolish or restrict the Death Penalty for murderers. 'Seperation of Church and State' which is not in this country's constitution but that of the SOviet Union's, they have launched a culture war on the values of this country. The Second Ammendment they ignore.  With Campain Finance 'reform' they deliberately allow the very people outside the political establishment to be gagged abridging the first ammendment rights they demand be respected for pornographers. I could go on. <br />This book is a must read.	2004-01-04
US	44417255	R1B2TUTRRX2J4W	0785329633	484783177	The Holocaust Chronicle	Books	4	40	45	N	Y	informative	This book is one of the best sources of information on Hitler's bloody act of social engineering I have come across.    However, it does have deficiencies I would like to see corrected in a future edition.     It mentions the crimes of Aufseherin Irma Grese, but gives somebody else's picture.    But even worse, it omitts the activities of Germany's very activist Juduciary in assisting, through Dynamic Interpretation, (what would not be called 'evolving standards'),the nazis with their agenda.    It does not mention the case of Erich Charrel vs Ufa Film studios in which the courts defined Jews as being Legally Dead, (Civil Death) as far as contractual purposes are concerned.    Nor does it mention the Airforce House Conference of 23 -24 April of 1941 in Berlin where the heads of the courts gave Hitler a green light to murder the sick and others deemed as people with Lives unworthy of life. (This actually shocked me). Though it mentions Wannsee Conference.      Nor does it mention the travesties after the war in which the courts of Germany and Austria covered for the murderers. Granting them pensions. And givingthem mere slaps on the wrists for murdering thousands if not tens of thousands of innocent human beings.     I did like the listing of the dead, as far as numbers go. But to make them more effective at comunicating the extent of the attrocity, I wish they had given the number of dead with the number available to be murdered.    Beyond these flaws, this is an excellent book on the subject of the Holocaust.	2003-12-17

And then you will want more. <br />The Uchronia List of alternate history does not do this novel justice in its description of 'An Israili goes back in time to assasinate Hitler only to disover that this does not prevent the Holocaust'. It is much  much more.<br />Well researched, well thought out, well written, Politically Most UnCorrect. This author knows his history, and blends it well with his story. And though the price is higher than most books of this size, it gives the reader more value. <br />Superior to any other novel of this genre, alternate history. Which are  all too often Sci-Fies set in the past devoid of logic or factual base. And all too often written by writers who did not bother to do more than a slight bit of research. <br />This is not a comic book plot novel, but a trip through history.<BR>Indeed, despite the time travel parts which are logically portrayed, this is more a Historic Novel based on what could have been, as true alternate history novels should be. <br />The characters are three dimensional, and could be living in your neiborhood.  The settings they are in are most believable.<br />If you enjoy historical novels, you will enjoy this novel.  If you enjoy Jack Higgens or Tom Clancy, you will enjoy SeaLion's Byte. <br />The only thing this novel needs is a sequel.	2003-12-16

It was this nation's greatest war, as well as being the war in which this nation was born.  <br />Just as I have been an admirer of Osprey Publishers for the quality they produce in their books.<br />Brendan Morrissey is one of the most facinating of their writers. Because here is an Englishman writing so well about battles in a war his country lost, without putting in a single sour word.  And though I still think ins work Boston 1775 is his best so far, Quebec 1775 is pretty good. Since it gives a good view to a campain that took place during the crucial early phase of this war, in which had anything gond different, we might still be part of the Commonwealth, Though we would be controling it.  <br />I enjoyed this book.	2003-11-18

Just as you get to meet the innocent human beings who were slaughtered there.<br />It is a cold expression of human evil in its coldest unemotional form.<br />The cold facts are depressing. And an appetite killer for the unnitiated. Like all material on the Holocost, there is only depression from what is here. <br />I only wish the death camp of Chlemno had been included in this work, for scholarly reasons. I know that Chelmno, the first of the death camps, used gas vans, and there are a fed other differences. But it would save the reader one less visit to hell to study.	2003-08-01

Had it not been for that, our children would be living among the stars today.   Fact is, so much of the Fedral government is a waste of money that could have been spent here for something truly worth while.<br />Imagine if you will a world of rolling grass covered hills and green vallies, much like Seattle and and various other areas, endless land and clean aiar for which real families can grow and thrive without any restrictions on resources.  This is the interior of a Space Island. This world, if we reaach for it, can be our's. <br />I would urge that this book be updated and brought back into print and be made required reading for all High School Science students so that they may learn to reach for the stars.<br />Another book worth reading on this subject is The HIGH FRONTIER by Dr. Gerard K.
