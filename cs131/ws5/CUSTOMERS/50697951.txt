These tales of workplace poverty, humiliation and misfortune aren't happening in a land far, far away. And they are less and less likely to be happening to nameless, faceless strangers as our national standard of living declines. Middle class degreed Americans get layed off from organizations as jobs are outsourced or eliminated by technology. The rate of return on professional job applications diminishes with age. Those who venture into the promised land of self employment often find it difficult to make a living. The author writes from the perspective of one who has experienced privilege adding realism to this virtual experience for others currently in privileged socio-economic situations. Read this book with a sense of outrage or a sense of voyeurism, but be at least a little concerned. Even if you aren't faced with a work deficit, your taxes are guaranteed to rise to support those who do.	2005-05-03

But if they possess the magic key to getting an interview, they don't share it. Readers won't get the interview everytime because the advice is tired and common: list your experiences and education on your resume; attach a cover letter. Basic online job hunting tips have been layered on top to make the advice seem fresh. It's not. And if it worked, there wouldn't be any need for newer strategies such as the \\"accomplishment\\" strategy (at least you prove that you were useful to a business) and the \\"self-marketing\\" strategy (much more aligned with a business's needs). As an employer, I want to know what a candidate will do to bring profit to my business and peace of mind to me. It's that simple. I don't want to infer or guess.  And, contrary to what this book implies, I am more receptive to candidates who show initiative and creativity.	2005-04-27

The book's message is a truism: only you are responsible for your own happiness. It goes on to encourage you to ask for what you want. These aren't bad assertions but they're more complicated to implement than this book would have you believe. The content is structured like an article in a woman's magazine: it uses a bulletized format with basic questions to ask yourself like &quot;What do you enjoy&quot; followed by inane suggestions like &quot;Decorate your office&quot;. Cloying and without substance, this book fails to answer many core questions. What if your boss declines your request? What motivates an organization? How do you make lateral moves? Where are the examples of individuals who reengineered their work situation and how exactly they did it ? Granted, too many employees don't understand the work relationship or how to work an organization. But this is not the book that will address those issues. If you're still determined to read this book, my copy is up for sale on Amazon's used site.	2004-03-22

Not much is going well in his life. But that doesn't necessarily make a story bad - just much darker than the previous installments. It isn't even poor because the conclusion is obvious from the start. Uncharacteristic of Burke, the story lacks soul. The characters are ambivalent. One can't even decide whether to be violent. The descriptions of weather replace the humor, observations and philosophy that enriched previous accounts. In fact, Robicheaux has a major life event which isn't developed at all. Maybe true to life, Robicheaux has become jaded and faded, but it doesn't make for interesting reading.	2004-01-09

The prequel, \\"Raising Your Spirited Child\\", teaches parents to first adjust to their child's temperament and is quite good. Much of content is repeated in this book. The disadvantage of this book is that the messages get lost in the overly abundant stories used to humanize and illustrate behavioral points. And all have simple causes and neat conclusions. Reading was slow and not particularly beneficial. For a parenting book that better addresses common problems, common responses and better responses, read \\"How to Talk to Your Child\\".

Avoiding \\"bad\\" foods does not always result in a nutritious diet. In this book, basic nutrition is followed by nutritious - and mainstream - recipes. What would have been useful is a section describing how to increase the nutritional content of existing recipes without changing their essense. But there is good content in this book. One surprise - the author also takes a hardline with firm tofu: forget it. It was truly liberating. Instead of obsessing with incorporating tofu into our diet, I decided to have more fun with other nutritious foods that we like better. And this book is intended to be fun and is targeted to parents. There are few better gifts to give children than a nutritious diet and an understanding of nutrition.	2003-11-26

That's probably because the book assumes some context. If you already know Portuguese but have gotten rusty, this IS a good book. It focuses on your most likely scenario: casual conversation. It makes it especially easy to shore up verb tenses (my problema). However, it doesn't convey pronunciation. To supplement this book, try to locate a local Brazilian group (start with a university's language department) and meet new people in the process. Or watch a Brazilian film and try not to peek at the subtitles. Another fun approach for conversational Portuguese is to pick up a Brazilian novela (although you'll also need a dictionary for this).	2003-11-24

He is accessible, direct, humane and free. Foremost, he gives callers enough information to make their own decisions. That's why it was so surprising to find such strong biases in his book. For example, he downplays the danger of fat. He goes further to imply that weight loss attempts are futile. That can't be so - most of us have seen Subway's Jarred on TV? But then Dr. Dean counters that the media is not necessarily the best source of medical information due to its underlying motivations. He doesn't mention that scientific findings are not always concrete and sometimes conflict. This is why anyone does well to consider multiple reference points and form educated conclusions. Don't misunderstand this review: this book is full of interesting data and made me view my kitchen differently, but it is not the ultimate medical reference.	2003-11-06

The goal of this book is to give parents insight into why certain situations occur and how to help their daughters address them. Politics are part of any social interaction but the compilation of scenarios in this book are complex and vicious. While informative, the book takes a reactive stance. Just how do girls get entangled in these webs in the first place? How do parents raise a girl to have enough sense of self worth to let ugliness roll off or stand up for whatever is right? This book is truly a huge inspiration to read books about child development, self esteem and socialization.

When is the last time consumers said \\"I'll pay more\\" or shareholders said \\"I'll take less\\" so that employees can afford decent food and healthcare, land isn't polluted or pillaged, small businesses and local jobs are maintained, etc.?  The note-worthy part is that corporations operate with limited consequences for using detrimental means of accomplishing their goals: low wages, environmental damage, health hazards, etc. And it is probably no different in any other industry. The author implies that socialism is the answer. But this is exactly where freedom and democracy come into play. Vote with your wallet. Don't vote for candidates who disregard the public's welfare. Corporations have not foisted these practices upon the public; the public has allowed them. The question is whether the public is ready to personally and literally pay the price.	2003-09-08

But far worse, it is a very real danger. A large percentage of childhood molestation goes unreported, silently scarring a child for life. This book strikes the right balance: it is not too technical, not awkward, and most importantly not frightening. The message is conveyed through a mom telling a story to her child and through repetition. The content and wording is geared toward a child as young as 3 although concepts such as trickery and secrecy are a little difficult to teach at this age. The book gives context and viable solutions that a child can handle. My child is now very good at screaming \\"Get away from me; I'll tell my mom and dad!\\" Don't take the risk; read this book.	2003-08-09

There's something special about an Italian cookie bakery with the variety of designs and flavors. I tried four recipes. Two were good but were similar to recipes I already had: Coconut Macaroons and Anise cookies. The other two were failures: the Florentines were so thin that they separated from the almonds and the Sesame cookies were inedibly bitter. Many of the recipes use the same base ingredients which makes for easy preparation but somewhat redundant taste. I wished for the more elaborate cookies. My biggest issue was the lack of photos for visual guidance. Also appearance is a huge part of Italian cookies. I'm sure that the absence of photos kept the cost of printing down but it was a false economy.  I will try more recipes in this book but will also look for others with more instruction.	2003-06-02

This is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained - some missing context, some missing closure. And they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense, as stories may focus on nature, archaeology, sociology, etc. While the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference, there is good information (ex. &quot;wisdom&quot; of cave diving). Some stories hit the vicarious adventurer's sweet spot. The author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in Kentucky, engaging the reader with educational content (ex. barometric effect on air flow), spectacular descriptions(ex. lightening igniting bat guano), and hair raising suspense (ex. getting lost in a maze of passages).

The legal system is a game of chance with much beyond the control of the average person (easy examples: the judge and jury). The odds are improved by money which you probably don't have if you're reading this book. A contingency arrangement is unlikely judging by the book's content devoted to paying a lawyer. The odds are also improved by finding a lawyer who will pursue a case with a vengeance, also unlikely given this book's cautions and the fact that lawyers without contingencies get paid regardless of outcome. This book is one source of information to help you decide whether to get involved in a legal matter; counter to its title, it actually advises against legal action.
