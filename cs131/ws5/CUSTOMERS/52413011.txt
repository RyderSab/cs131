And check out the Alice-in-Wonderland take on Fair Isle... the stripes are creatively skewed! <br /> <br />For a more conservative dresser, some of the patterns may be too experimental, but if you want to skip the asymmetrical tank, you'll find some pretty ruffled gloves and a ballet top.	2005-04-29

If you're looking to create a beautiful knitted home accent and don't feel like worrying about gauge, this is the book for you. Knit Mediterranean-style mosaic rugs with slip-stitch knitting, or a cheery 5-color rug for a baby's room, or a handsome cable-edged rug, a Shaker pinwheel, or even a loopy pile bathroom mat.

The size small of the easy buttoned cardigan measures only 18 inches long, which must be a size 0-2. A beginner would not necessarily realize this; experts could make their own adjustments, but the book is written for those who have a bit less experience.	2005-01-13

Ms. Modesitt, a master knitter, writes a book from the perspective of a natural problem-solver with innate talent. Intermediate to advanced knitters will find a wealth of information in her book, from cabling without a cable needle, slip-stitch color knitting, and even knitting with wire. However, although Modesitt is adamant about not \\"dumbing down\\" her excellent and innovative material, beginning knitters or those who learn more slowly may need a bit more guidance than is offered in this book. Perhaps a later edition will provide more photos and explanations.	2004-12-13

My only gripe is that I think it would have been helpful to rate the patterns by difficulty. For this beginning knitter, some projects look like they would be simple but then require more advanced skills (such as the grafting in the felted slippers project). It definitely helps to have the first Stitch N Bitch book to refer to, in those cases. <br /> <br />The beginning section about the spread of the Stitch N Bitch phenomenon and about customizing one's own patterns is very enjoyable to read because the author has an engaging, enthusiastic writing style. I admire her for starting and capitalizing on a trend that is providing hours of creativity and enjoyment for many new knitters... and indeed ceasing to be a trend, instead becoming part of our popular culture and a link to the past.	2004-11-20

The author is passionate about this foolproof way to knit a customizable sweater to fit absolutely anyone.  <br /> <br />As a previous reviewer said, the point of the book is for the knitter to customize his/her own sweater. So, although the designs at the back of the book are not very attractive to someone with a more contemporary fashion sense, the lessons outlined at the beginning of the book are invaluable.	2004-11-17

I've tried to learn to knit about three times and thrown down my needles in frustration.

There's also a helpful chapter on fixing all kinds of knitting mistakes, which I'm sure I will need a lot.	2004-09-17

Unfortunately, as some others have attested, the character of the dog in this novel is much more sympathetic than those of the humans. Lexy, the narrator's wife, was a whiny, irrational and frustratingly self-involved character who I found it difficult to care about. The focus of the novel is on how the narrator deals with his grief over the loss of his wife, so this was a major problem.<br />Also, there were some really nice metaphors and good, original descriptions, but the leap into &quot;noir&quot; halfway through the book felt forced.	2004-07-14

The author of Soul Signs has created her own via the guidance of her spirit Grey Eagle and her own 20-odd years of observation of the human psyche. Although you may not take her word as gospel, she has developed an interesting system of \\"typing\\" people. There are 13 spiritual \\"types\\" in her system.<br />I myself am having a difficult time deciding which of the 13 \\"soul types\\" I am, so the book is perhaps not as helpful to me as it could have been. Also controversial is the idea that there is a very small minority of souls who are truly evil, not just disturbed. The author opines that there are people who born \\"dark souls\\" who are here just to revel in the hurt they cause others and for which there is no redemption.<br />If you can accurately choose your own type from the  descriptions, then you'll be able to choose your most compatible soul mates from several charts included with the book. Good luck.	2004-05-30

She mutilates herself whenever she feels sad and lonely. <br />A virile young student with conventional ideas of romance falls in love with the her. However, the teacher's concept of love is of the S&M variety. The handsome student misunderstands her intentions towards him and interprets them as rejection. His wounded pride eventually leads him to beat her up and rape her, breaking her nose and rib. The teacher walks around in a short dress afterwards, carrying around a knife to mutilate herself further.<br />This book tries too hard to be disturbing and the results are over-the-top and irritating.	2002-11-23

Emerson traces the convergence of the various terrorist groups to the year 1989 and proceeds with a detailed history of their growth from there. Among Emerson's colleagues is the liberal Muslim, Khalid Duran, who wrote a book about fostering understanding between religions. Duran has also been subject to death threats from militant conservative Islamist organizations.<br />Especially disturbing are Emerson's observations on how the militant groups hide under the cover of \\"charitable organizations\\" which are exempt from scrutiny. And the way the militants deny their activities even as they are caught red-handed is maddening. <br />This is an extremely important book. We ignore it at our peril. The very existence of the United States is in danger unless we pay attention to the militant Islamist threat.	2002-02-07

I received this colorful cookbook as a gift, and I have already tried several of the uncomplicated (one-star) recipes. I have just finished sharing the tasty Spinach Rice with my boyfriend and there is none left. Tonight I made the chickpea curry, a flavorful dish seasoned with paprika, turmeric, coriander, cumin, chili powder, and an Indian spice called garam masala. This dish is very low in fat (only one tablespoon of oil) but the spices make it quite delicious!<br />There is an entire chapter on polenta that I can't wait to try, and there is even an entire chapter on beverages, with different coffee and cocoa drinks.<br />I believe this cookbook was written in British English, so some of the vocabulary terms will be slightly differ ent than in American English (spring onion = scallion, capsicum = hot pepper,etc.) but overall this is a scrumptious and easy-to-use cookbook!	2001-12-15

They are also difficult to put in chronological order. <br />This book was written in 1999. The author wrongly predicted the untimely death of Bill Clinton and the ascension of Gore to the presidency at the start of the millennium. Although Kane does make many references to the beginning of an Islamist war, he fingers Iran as the culprit, when Shiite Iran is one of the only Middle Eastern countries who is hostile to the Sunni fundamentalists.<br />One impressively interpreted quatrain is:<br />&quot;Pestilences passed, the world becomes smaller<BR>For a long time lands will be inhabited peacefully<BR>People will cross through the skies, safely, over land and seas<BR>Then wars will start again.&quot;<br />Kane says that this quatrain deals with the new millennium. The attacks of September 11 have indeed brought the safe crossings to a halt.<br />Most impressively, Kane says about a particular quatrain dealing with World War III: &quot;I wonder if the Arab prince in line 1 is the notorious Saudi Osama Bin Laden; a billionaire who funds Islamic fundamentalist groups....(and who is known to his followers as the &quot;Prince of Terror&quot;.<br />So the reader must judge for him/herself.	2001-11-14

Witness the recent cozying up of Rupert Murdoch's media empire to the Chinese government. Censorship? Coming right up!<br />&quot;No Logo&quot;, written in the late '90s, is proving to be very prescient. This week I read in the news that two teenage boys are offering their entire lives to First USA in exchange for a college education (they are becoming walking advertisements, bringing the company up in every conversation and only wearing clothing with the company logo), and that a family is offering corporations the chance to name their infant in exchange for some money to build a house.
