I was very impressed by it.<br />I find that this book is quite different from Theory and Practice of Conseling and Psychology.  In simple terms, this book is not very technical, and is very shallow in many respect.  Definitely not a book which I would recommend if you are interested in studying Counseling and Psychology, in which case I would recommend you to purchase Theory and Practice of Conseling and Psychology instead.<br />However if you are a teenager and would like to know more about yourslef, this book may not be a bad choice.	2003-07-31
