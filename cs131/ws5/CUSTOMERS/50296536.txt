I used to play The Virginian on NBC television, for those of you who can't remember that far back. It's that time again, time to read Shane. I'm only into it up to chapter six, and already those old memories have flooded back, and I recall why I love this book so much. It is timeless, to use a perhaps overused word. It is nearly a flawless book, although for the first time I've noticed that a few of his time elements are incredible, such as, for example, the time it takes Marion to bake a pie in the book. But this is such a good book that things like this don't matter. The only Western author I can truly say I enjoy as much as Jack Shaefer is Kirby Jonas, a young author whose books I read on audio for Books In Motion, who can be located at Booksinmotion.com . But in my opinion Shane can never be topped nor matched by anyone. If you are a young person and feel forced into reading this book, I wish I could tell your teachers, &quot;Don't force Shane on anyone!&quot; This book should be read in your leisure time, when YOU want to, to be truly enjoyed. I hope you will give it an honest chance.	2003-05-08

I'm James Drury, and I've played in plenty of Western shows myself. For those of you who don't know me I portrayed The Virginian on NBC television for many years. So I hope that qualifies me to leave a review on a Western book. Of course I could say the same thing about any Elmore Leonard book I've had the pleasure of reading, but the Bounty Hunters was great. It was short and to the point, but Leonard has this way of giving you such a great feel for the country and old West settings it just makes the book pleasant. He excels at making us see what he does in very few words. I have read all of the Western novels of Kirby Jonas on audio, and while I of course think he is my favorite author of Westerns, I have to say I have never read a bad Elmore Leonard book, and The Bounty Hunters is no exception. I don't know Leonard's history as far as how he does his research. I know Kirby Jonas lived in southeast Arizona when he was working on his first books, however, and it seems to me that Leonard has done a large amount of work in getting the facts about the Arizona and Mexico country down pat. I guess I've gotten into the habit of comparing every Western author not to Louis L'Amour but to Kirby Jonas, and although I would never put Leonard above Jonas I would sure say his books would &quot;do to ride the river,&quot; with Jonas', so to speak. Give the Bounty Hunters a try. Right now I'm starting into Escape from Five Shadows, and it already holds great promise!	2002-10-16

Shane was such a book. The fact that there could be any rating in this section other than a 5 simply astounds me. People keep talking about this stump in the book like the book was about the stump. If you think the book was &quot;about a stump&quot; you are too young to be reading beyond grade school level. Jack Schaefer had a hugely powerful grasp of the West and of Western characters, and he left us a legacy with this book that can never be topped. That's coming from a man who reads Kirby Jonas's novels on audio tape. I enjoy Kirby Jonas's books to no end, and I know of no better author, but Jack Schaefer's &quot;SHANE&quot; is a book for anyone to strive to match. It is an all-time classic that I would put hand in hand with Kirby Jonas's DEATH OF AN EAGLE. It's a shame anyone ever has to feel like they're &quot;forced&quot; to read such a tremendous book as Shane.	2001-11-13

I've done some other reviews on some of Louis L'Amour's stuff, and I don't know if these ever get used, but I wanted to say I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've been reading Kirby Jonas's Westerns on audio tape lately and have enjoyed them so thoroughly because, frankly, they reminded me of Louis L'Amour's style. Kirby admits he grew up on Louis L'Amour, so I guess that explains it. And by the way, if you run out of Louis L'Amours and want to give someone else a shot, try one of Kirby's. You won't regret it. But back to Kilkenny, it is a fast-paced surefire way to get your afternoon, evening, or even your morning in gear, and a thoroughly entertaining way to spend an afternoon on a deer stand!	2001-11-13

You might remember me from the Virginian. I don't read many of Terry Johnston's books, but I read this one and I want to leave you some of my thoughts. First, it's a shame to have Terry Johnston gone. He left us way too young, and cancer got another one. I do enjoy Johnston's stuff, but I have to say it's a little rough for my tastes. I read all of Kirby Jonas's novels on audio tape, and Kirby has a similar flair to Johnston as far as historical authenticity but without the bite of graphic violence, too much cussing, and other things just better left to the imagination. I know I sound like I'm slamming an author who was well-loved by many and always will be. I don't mean to slam him, and I do recommend this and all of his books if you are strong of stomach. For a milder, but still authentic taste of the West, read Kirby Jonas's books or listen to me read them on audio. Thanks for hearing me out.	2001-11-13

These days I'm reading books onto audio tape, so I get the chance to read a lot of books. I must say, if you like gritty realism, you will like this Johnstone book. I liked it, but because of the amount of violence I probably would not let a younger reader pick it up. I have heard Johnstone compared to Kirby Jonas, and I guess my best way to review this book is to say, if you enjoy realism with a lot of violence, go with Johnstone, and if you enjoy your realism with the violence slightly toned down, go with Jonas. He is my personal favorite. But both are great writers and will surely live on forever with well deserved notoriety!	2001-08-20

I used to play the Virginian on television, and now I read books on tape. It's a lot of fun and has given me a lot of chances to read books like this one by Compton, as well as books by Kirby Jonas, William Johnstone, and Elmer Kelton. This book is one that will appeal to any audience who enjoys a lot of action in their books and some enjoyable characters. Kirby Jonas is by far the best writer of Westerns, in my opinion, but this book by Compton certainly puts him in the running, and I think once you read it you will agree. It keeps you hanging on until the very last page. Believe me, you won't want to put it down. For another treat, try Kirby Jonas's The Dansing Star next, and then Compton's Death Rides a Chestnut Mare.	2001-08-20

I used to play the Virginian on NBC television, and most recently I've taken to reading books on audio. I had to chuckle with surprise when I read the review below by Dan Huff, who compares Blakely's writing to Kirby Jonas'. I know both of these men, and both are great writers, although their work is highly varied from each other. In this book, Comanche Dawn, Blakely does write differently than some of his books I've seen in the past. It's more of a literary novel, and a good one in its own realm. Blakely plays a mean guitar and has one of the best singing voices in America, in my opinion, so his talent should take him far. Read this book to see what it was like for the Comanches and their best friend, the horse. It is a deeper book than Blakely's earlier stuff, but just as enjoyable. And if you want to compare him to Kirby Jonas yourself I would suggest you try out Jonas' Legend of the Tumbleweed, also available on Amazon.	2001-08-20

I used to play television's Virginian for many years, and I hope that gives me some kind of credit in reviewing this book.<br />I thought the book followed along well, but it was a pretty harsh, perhaps too harsh book at times. <br />Anyone interested in reading about the West but not necessarily what one would call &quot;Westerns&quot; might want to pick up books by Elmer Kelton, Kirby Jonas or Mike Blakely as well.

I used to play the Virginian on TV, for those of you who might not know me. I just saw that last review on Mike Blakely's book, Too Long At The Dance, and I couldn't let it stand without an argument. I have read several of Mike's books, and a lot of other western novels, including narrating Kirby Jonas' books onto Audio Tape for Books in Motion. I hope that qualifies me as one who can judge a good or a bad Western novel.<br />This novel by Mike is superb. It is packed with high quality research and excitement and very believable characters, and it brings a very satisfying ending to the story begun with Shortgrass Song. I hope you folks who read these reviews will take my review to heart. I have no idea what the last reviewer was doing when he was supposed to be reading this book, but he obviously knows nothing about the West and perhaps has never read a Western book before in his life. This was a very good novel and well worth anyone's time, if you like authenticity in your reading.	2000-12-30

(His others need a six!) This was a great ending to the first book, which left me on the edge of the proverbial seat wondering what would happen to this character, Tappan Kittery.

I played The Virginian for nine years, as some of you may remember, and I had occasion to read many Western and to enjoy many of them come to life on the screen. None of them were much better than this book by A.B. Guthrie. This man writes with a power that is seldom seen anymore, a power and a flowing poetry that would be hard to beat. If you haven't read this book, please do yourself the favor. I promise you will not regret it. This one is not to be missed. A.B. Guthrie, with this book, has produced a story as ruggedly poetic as the best of Elmer Kelton, Kirby Jonas or Elmore Leonard--even Jack Schaefer.	2000-12-13

I say this only to add a little authority to this review. If you haven't read Louis L'Amour, and particularly this book, you ought to build up the fire, sit down on your couch, and kick back. You are in for a treat. John Wayne brought Hondo to life, but he couldn't have done it without this book to build from. Wayne said this was his favorite Western novel, and in the world of Westerns we all trust the Duke! Make sure you read this book if you get the chance, and if you haven't read L'Amour and you take a liking to him you might also want to try Elmore Leonard, Elmer Kelton, Mike Blakely or Kirby Jonas.	2000-12-13

But I must say this is probably Kirby's best work yet. I played the Virginian on NBC television for nine years, and this book is as good as any of the many scripts I saw over all those years. Kirby has created a super character here in Kate Winchester, and every character in the book is someone who draws your interest, whether you like them or not. If you like this book, you might also like the audio version of it and all of Kirby's other books, which I narrated on tape for Books in Motion. I have read many Western novels, and Kirby Jonas is my favorite Western writer.<br />Make sure you give this one a try.	2000-12-11

Folks, I have to say this is the best Larry McMurtry has ever written and probably the best he will ever write, as I didn't care tremendously for much of his other stuff. But here we see Gus and Woodrow and Jake and Deets and all the other wonderful, colorful characters who have come to mean so much to us as an American people, not only because of the television portrayal by superb actors, but because of this book. If you haven't read Lonesome Dove, you really need to do yourself the favor. If you noticed, I gave it a rating of five, even though McMurtry stole many of his names for real life people of the old West and fudged on some of his historical dates. It was easy to forget that because of the wonderful dialogue and the emotion he built inside us all, far more than a Louis L'Amour book ever could have. <br />Larry McMurtry, in creating Lonesome Dove, made for us a novel that can be appreciated by all, a novel as good as the best of Elmer Kelton, Elmore Leonard or Kirby Jonas. It is a story we could never forget, even if we tried. It is a novel, like Kelton's, Leonard's, and Jonas', that doesn't have to be read by a Western reader to be enjoyed. It is a novel that will reward readers from all walks of life.	2000-12-01

I've just finished three novels by Ralph Compton in the last couple of weeks and this is one of them, so tonight I wanted to share with you my views on a rare writer that I think the world  should be sad to have lost.<br />Ralph Compton kept his books clean and  readable for anyone, and that is certainly a rarity these days. He kept the  action moving, and if you don't mind some historical inaccuracies you will  really like his books. As the previous reviewer indicated, just please  don't take Mr. Compton seriously on a lot of his writing where historical  figures are represented. He is not always true to facts. His gun leather  and much of his detail about western dress is also erroneous, and these are  my reasons for not giving this book a five star rating. Otherwise, it is  very readable.<br />As an aside, I'm reading books on tape now by another  author by the name of KIRBY JONAS, and I highly recommend that if you like  Western novels you try him out. He has quickly become my favorite. And on  his newer books, I am one of his proofreaders--so YES, I can vouch for his  historical authenticity and beautiful writing style.	2000-05-10

I played television's The Virginian for nine years, and I hope that gives me some kind of credit when reviewing a western novel.<br />For those of you who haven't read Ralph Compton, you are  in for a real nice book. It's fast moving and vivid. If you don't mind a  few trespasses outside the realm of accuracy on Old West outfits (boots,  gun leather, etc.), you will really like Ralph Compton. I am only sorry he  passed away. I'm sure he was headed for a very long and promising career if  he had continued.<br />Incidentally, for those of you who read a lot of  westerns, Kirby Jonas is a young author whose books I'm recording on audio  cassette. I must say he is probably the best author of Western novels I  have ever read, and if you like Ralph Compton, or even if you don't, give  Kirby's books a try. I guarantee you won't be sorry.	2000-05-10

This was a great example of his  work.<br />I used to play The Virginian on television for nine years with many  great actors. I read the work of many writers, and there are very few as  good as Kelton for realism and grit. The only man who can match him is  Kirby Jonas, whose books I record on audio. They call Jonas the New Louis  L'Amour. But as far as I'm concerned, and I've seen this written elsewhere  by other reviewers, you don't need any other writers than Kelton and Jonas.  Give the Buckskin Line a chance! You won't be sorry. Then try Death of an  Eagle, by Kirby Jonas.	2000-04-20

I had never seen that done in a  western novel before, but it was extremely effective.<br />I would recommend  this book to anyone. It is clean, with no sex, very little cussing, and no  graphic violence. But it reads very realistically, all the same, without the  offensive material. I can't say enough good about it. They didn't put my  entire forward on this site, but if you get a chance to read the book  you'll see everything I really think about Kirby Jonas and his books.

For nine years I portrayed THE VIRGINIAN on television, and I had a lot of chances to read the writing of many  different people. After nine years, I can honestly say that Kirby Jonas is  probably my favorite writer.<br />I have just finished reading three of  Kirby's books on tape for one of the major Book on Tape companies,  including the Dansing Star. I have become emotionally involved in all of  his books, and I sure I always will. You readers have a tremendous  opportunity to raise your mind to a higher level and bring yourself to the  edge of your seat. Don't miss out. Kirby Jonas is better than Louis  L'Amour, I must say, and he is going to go a long way toward bringing the  Western Novel back to the forefront of literature today.<br />Since The  Dansing Star, Kirby has gone on to write three more tremendous novels,  Death of an Eagle, Legend of the Tumbleweed, and Lady Winchester. The last  one is not even in print yet, but Kirby gave me the privilege of reading  the manuscript, and you are in for a treat. It has as its central character  a woman, and a very strong one, but also a very feminine one. I guarantee  another hit. Keep watching Kirby Jonas. He is going to leave Louis L'Amour  in his dust.	2000-01-20

As the book that first introduced me to Kirby Jonas, Death of an Eagle may always be my favorite. It had such a new, fresh quality to it that I was intrigued and hooked from the first page. <br />I portrayed television's The Virginian for many years, and in that portrayal I got to recognize varying  degrees of quality in writing and in the way things were portrayed. I have  to tell everyone who has a chance to read any of Kirby Jonas's books that  you are making a grave error if you let this chance go by. I am so  impressed with this author. I was so impressed with his books, in fact,  that I suggested putting them on audio tape, and Kirby and I have since  undertaken that endeavor with a major book on tape company in Washington  State. I have read, to date, Death of an Eagle and The Dansing Star onto  tape and plan to do them all.<br />I have become biased about Kirby's books,  of course, because we have become friends. But I can't imagine he could  write a bad book, and I would stake my reputation on that. What a  tremendous boon this man is to the Western fiction field.<br />Death of an  Eagle will draw you in to the world of Jose Olano and Robert McAllister  with such force that you won't want to let go of them. You'll feel  goosebumps as you read it, and you will smell the smells, feel the  feelings, even taste what they taste. Kirby Jonas is real, and he is  authentic, and as far as I can see he is the best western novel writer  there is. I have read Zane Grey books on tape before, and I never once lost  control of my reading to the point that I had to stop. SUch is not the case  with Kirby. His books drew me in so deeply emotionally that I had to stop  and have a cigarette several times and think about what I was involved in.  What a power this young man has with his audience. DO NOT MISS HIM.	2000-01-10
