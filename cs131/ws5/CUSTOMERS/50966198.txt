Some of the new (1990 and on) editions of Scarry stories have art that is slightly \\"off\\" from Scarry's style, and text that does not convey Scarry's wit and fun storytelling style.  Rest assured that this edition has both of those!	2005-09-05

When I first bought this book, I wasn't sure if my son would like it, but he wants it read again and again.  The illustrations are detailed and very colorful; he loves them.  This is a good introduction or reintroduction to the basic concepts of the four questions for any child.	2005-03-29

He loves the illustrations (especially the one where Henry has had an accident on the floor).  But I wish that it was a little more 'instructional' for him.  The book never discusses some really important elements of potty training, like wiping afterwards or washing hands.  The cover of the book shows Henry playing with the toilet paper roll, but never shows toilet paper inside the book and never once mentions what toilet paper is actually for.  I guess this is a good book for very beginning children who just need to be introduced to the very basic elements of just sitting on the potty.	2005-03-12

My only complaint would be that it does not explain why children look for the Afikomen, or explain any of the objects it shows (Elijah's cup, the Haggadah, etc.)  But this book does interest my 1 year old son.  He seems to understand that it is fun and exciting to search for something, and follows the search in the book avidly.  I would say that this story is best for the very young, and for older children, you may want a book that is more \\"in depth\\" about Pesach.	2005-02-09

This book was a fun way to explain why we don't eat sand, kitty litter, or worms.  He loves this book, and we do too!  We all always laugh out loud when reading it.  The illustrations are really colorful and bold, and the text is downright funny.  Some people are offended by the advice not to eat earwax or boogers, but if you think it's not bad to warn a toddler about that (or even funny!) then your family will love this book.	2005-02-09

He is completely uninterested in the illustrations (both the color and the black and white ones) and the story always fails to hold his imagination.  My husband and I find the story line of a controlling mother slightly disturbing (although in fairness, our son does not seem to pick up on that).  If you are looking for a book from this author, I would suggest \\"Goodnight Moon\\" instead.	2005-02-09

But a novel also needs interesting characters and intriguing plot development.  I found that \\"Prep\\" lacked both.  There are literally places in the book where you can skip several pages and not miss a single important story point.  Above in one of the editorial reviews it is noted that the narrator, Lee, \\"sees herself as 'one of the mild, boring, peripheral girls' among her privileged classmates.\\"  She is indeed that.  I don't read novels to read about mild, boring, peripheral characters.  With all the undeserved comparisons to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" being made, I'd suggest reading that instead.	2005-02-07

For example, one of the \\"questions\\" handled is: \\"is it okay to kiss our daughter on the lips?\\"  The answer given is: \\"if you are comfortable with that, it's fine.  If you're not, don't do it.\\"  Most of the book is like this.  Another example: the authors advise readers that if they find their toddler sticking something dangerous in his nose or ear, they object should be taken away and the toddler told why they can't do that.  Do people really need to be told this stuff?  I found myself rolling my eyes at many of the Q & A topics in the book.  The monthly guide of milestones of development that your toddler should be reaching each month is useful, but other than that, I found this book a waste of my time and money.	2004-10-29

Readers are supposed to believe that she can teach them something about spirituality simply because her book was published.  Her self-congratulatory stories about her various addictions, how \\"fat\\" she thinks she is (even though anyone who has seen a photo of her knows she's thin) and episodes of neglecting her son do nothing to inspire me or move me spiritually.  Lamot thinks God exists to dole out rewards for self-indulgent behavior and make her feel good about herself.  If this is the God you believe in, then by all means, enjoy this book.	2004-09-05

It is an important book for anyone who wants to think about what it means to be a poet today, and why we write poetry.  But the reader should understand that this is not a \\"how-to\\" book.  Hamill does not cover any of the elements of writing skills or how to get published.  This is a book about poetry, not about how to write poetry.	2004-09-05

Most chapters are little more than Lamott's self-deprecating ancedotes about her father's death, what her priest says about being nice to people, and things that her son does that she thinks are cute.  I found myself often flipping ahead desperately trying to find some actual information about the art of writing.  That said, her chapter titled \\"Plot Treatment\\" was EXCELLENT.  It actually showed the real, live process that a writer and her editor went through to make a novel work and work well.  I wish the other 27 chapters had been as helpful in illustrating what it is that writers actually do.  I mean, telling us that we need to \\"know\\" our characters, or that we need to keep index cards and a pen with us all the time so that we can take notes for our novel, is hardly ground-breaking inspirational writing advice.  My time would have been better spent actually working on my writing instead of reading this book.  I suggest you save your time, as well.	2004-09-04

This book really helps you understand not just your disease and the tests and procedures you must undergo, but also the emotional process you will experience, from anger to fear to self-pity.  The author has MS and shares her experiences without being alarmist or depressing.  This book really lifted my sprits and made me feel like I could handle my disease.

The first chapter spends too much time discussing the symptoms of MS and how people who are experiencing these symptoms should be tested for MS instead of trying to convince themselves they have something else.  (Gee, thanks.)  Then it discusses all the tests that will be performed to diagnose MS.  Well, the reason I'm reading this book in the first place is because I have already been tested and been diagnosed.  Much of the rest of the book is ancedotal stories from people with a variety of symptoms, some of which are very alarming and depressing.  Overall, this book made me nervous, and less willing to learn more about MS.  I was looking for helpful and practical info about MS, and didn't find it.  What I did find were scary facts about the worst aspects of the disease.  I needed better from this book, and didn't get it.	2004-06-28

This book can be quite funny, but be warned that it is downright sad at points, especially when the authors highlight the way in which Nanny's young charge is neglected by his parents.  I enjoyed this book on the level that it is a scathing examination of the private worlds of the ultra-rich, from how they decorate their million-dollar New York apartments; to what they wear; to how they party or treat the 'help.'  But occasionally, the main character of this book is downright annoying.  How am I supposed to sympathize with a protagonist who allows her employer to do things to her that would have any normal person running to the Labor Department to file suit?  Take this one to the beach and use it as a light, fun read - don't expect tons of character development or any explanation of why Nanny is such a doormat.	2004-05-06

Every child will love this book even if they are not particularly interested in fire stations.  This is the story of a little boy who is convinced by a mischevious friend to stowaway aboard a firetruck and follow the firemen to a fire at a paint factory.  There are wonderful, colorful illustrations of the little boy and girl getting so covered with paint that their parents don't recognize them, and then taking big sudsy baths with huge bubble and splashes of paint when they get home.  The children I know who love this book enjoy both the adventure of the plot and the vivid illustrations.	2004-03-22

One of my complaints was that the binding (it is spiral-bound, like a notebook) kept opening up and falling apart.  I wish I had known this before I bought it.  I constantly had my husband getting his pliers out to fix it for me!  Additionally, even though this book is supposedly a &quot;journal,&quot; there is barely any room to write your thoughts, ideas, or experiences.  Instead of providing writing space for each day, you are given a 3 inch lined blank spot for each four days to write something.  Not my idea of a journal.  Some people may enjoy the day-by-day descriptions of what is happening inside you, but I found a few of them to be ridiculous assumptions.  For example, on the day of your due date, it says that your baby weighs 7 1/3 pounds and will measure at least 15 inches.  Statements like that made me feel that most of the blow-by-blow information was a 'guesstimate' at best, which decreased my enjoyment.<br />Instead, I would recommend &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting,&quot; &quot;Pregnancy for Dummies,&quot; or even &quot;The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy&quot; (if you are looking for something fun).	2003-10-18

This book is NOT a replacement for other books like \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting,\\" but is a fun read when you are bored and need to smile or laugh about the whole experience.  The only thing I could not identitfy with were Iovine's complaints about her husband.  She writes as though all men are football-watching, beer-swilling fools who are simply waiting for your pregnancy to be over so they can have sex with you again.  But other than that silly characterization of husbands, I found her book to be funny and fun to read.  This is a book to \\"take a break\\" with, and by NO MEANS is meant to be the sole book on pregnancy that you own or refer to.	2003-10-16

Some really important issues - like dealing with illness while pregnant - were dealt with in a very superficial way.  I am pregnant for the first time, and I have a ton of really specific questions.  This book does not go very far in answering those questions.  For a first-time mom, I would suggest &quot;What to Expect When You Are Expecting,&quot; instead.  This book simply does not provide enough detailed information to be truly helpful.

I bought this book because it was described as a \\"Memoir,\\" but it should be classified as an Essay instead. She spends plenty of time discussing her views on life, but none describing the colorful characters she has met and worked with, or the personal experiences that led to her political views.

But the last fourth of the novel was hugely disappointing.  I loved the development of the interesting characters, and the descriptions of NY during the dawn of electrical power.  But the fascinating murder mystery was tied up in a way I found hasty and unbelievable.  And the story's ending was depressing and anti-climactic.  Why introduce two romances and spend pages developing them only to have both of them go nowhere?  Why get us to invest our sympathy in the life of a charming and courageous heroine only to have her make mundane choices that result in such a dull and sad ending?<br />Though I enjoyed most of it, I would not recommend spending your money on this book.	2002-08-27
