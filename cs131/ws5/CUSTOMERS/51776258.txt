This book is big (in every sense of the word), jam packed with pictures of Baseman's art and designed incredibly well. Coffee table books watch out, there's a new kid on the block. <br />Paging through this massive tome you become fully immersed in Baseman's World; a world full of amputee Bunnies, drooling ice cream cones, masochistic snowmen, doggie Dunces, feline pinatas, plus unattainable beauty and human desire. Though many aspects of Baseman's career are on display (advertising, animation, editorial, packaging and product art), it is his paintings that truly shine. This is where Baseman can let go, and let go he does with a torrent of cute and fuzzy creatures mired in the most horribly painful human experiences. The humor is oftentimes juvenile and sadistic, but somehow it manages to engender a smile from the viewer, maybe because we're glad it's the Snowman who is getting his heart broken (by a mermaid no-less) and not us. There is something else, that elusive \\"indefinable\\" quality, that gives Baseman's work it's mass(ive) appeal. His characterizations harken back to old Warner Bros. cartoons (who hasn't grown up on those?), which tickle the child inside, but the emotions and situations are purely human, which grabs the attention of our grown-up self. Baseman's greatest trick, however, is creating what appear to be very simple paintings. As with most great art repeated viewings are required to be able to peel back all the layers, and really see what's going on. And believe me, there is a lot going on.  <br />I doubt that many people unfamiliar with Baseman's work would get this book, but anyone who has been exposed (a very appropriate term actually) to his paintings, magazine/book covers or toys should jump on it. Highest rating possible from me.	2004-09-17

I haven't even read Bukowski's latest collection, THE NIGHT TORN MAD, but I was so happy to finally get the book from amazon, that I had to share my excitement (and give it an anticipated rating of four stars). I guess I shouldn't say I haven't read it yet, as I've gotten to page 27 already, and I have to say, this is classic Buk. John Martin and Bukowski, were wise to set aside poems, some of them dating back to the early '70s, so that we fans could gobble up each new posthumous collection. Speaking of which, this is the ELEVENTH Buk book to come out since he died (the 5th poetry collection, counting BETTING ON THE MUSE), which I find amazing. I can see why the rumor mongers think Martin has a ghost writer churning out these new collections. Anyway, having read only 27 pages I've already come across a Bukowski classic, a poem entitled, &quot;Beagle,&quot; which contains the line the book title was taken from. I can't wait to see what the rest of the book holds for me. Hail hail the Buk!	2001-11-01

This is the first Buk book I ever read, and remains my all time favorite. Is it his best book? No, my vote would go to HAM ON RYE for that, but it is, in my opinion, his wildest and most fun read of all! Along with CATCHER IN THE RYE, CATCH 22, and SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, POST OFFICE should be regarded, and taught, as a CLASSIC American comic masterpiece! Kudos to any high school lit teacher or college prof with the balls to make this book required reading. If you've never read Bukowski, this is the place to start. If you've read all of Bukowski, and there are many of you out there, read this one again...just for the hell of it. Why not?	2001-10-31

It's a well-known fact that Martin never (I stress NEVER) got away with changing Buk's writing. The Buk himself said enough in regards to the problems with WOMEN, where Martin did in fact try to spice things up, but Buk caught EVERY SINGLE CHANGE, and demanded they be changed back, thus producing the only Buk/BSP book to be reprinted due to errors. Why then, would anyone think Martin got away with this with Buk's poetry? As far as literary attacks go, Buk fueled these on his own, and was notorious for burning numerous bridges (i.e the Webbs, the aforementioned Wantling, Steve Richmond, Marvin Malone, etc.). A good poem is a good poem regardless of who gets attacked. Most of these people retorted on their own, and understood the nature of the attack. I'm quite suspicious of this reviewer and am positive it is one of those poets who was villified in this collection, namely in the poem: &quot;300 poems.&quot; &quot;he was rich and I was poor / and the sea rolled in / and I turned the / white / pages.&quot; You know who you are. Regardless of any of that, this is one of Bukowski's finest literary achievements, hail the Buk!	2001-08-30

This collection, which I'm reading at the same time with her latest book MERCUROCRHOME, only reinforces my stance. As a young white male I shied away from Coleman's writing for quite some time, thinking, however ignorant this may seem, that I'd find nothing in common with her, nothing to relate to. When you're wrong you're wrong, and when I finally did dive into her work (her first book MAD DOG, BLACK LADY) I felt like I did when I first read Bukowski: I had found something special. Some have deemed Coleman as the &quot;Black, female Bukowski,&quot; but of course this is too simple a comparison. They both hailed from the underbelly of LA, and both can't seem to get the city out of their blood. Coleman's poetry does share something with Bukowski's early lyricism, but beyond that there is no real comparison (the only other thing I can think of is that Black Sparrow has published nearly all of their books). Coleman's work is more studied and stylized, more diverse in technique and scope. I have had the great pleasure and honor now of actually publishing some of Coleman's work, and her power continues to blow me away. I look forward to every new piece she puts out there.	2001-08-23

Wanda Coleman has been publishing with Black Sparrow Press for nearly 25 years, which is amazing since she's only 55, and looks much younger than that. Even more amazing than the devotion she and BSP share, is the strength and vitality encompassed in each new volume they produce together. MERCUROCHROME, her latest, may be in fact her best. It is not too long, as the review above would suggest (her last collection of poems is nearly three years old now so there's plenty to print), nor is the power diluted. On the contrary, Coleman's voice is as strong as ever. And as diverse. I don't know if I've ever read a collection of sonnets or transliterations of mainly dead-white guys, that was so compelling. This book is as red-hot as the title suggests. Huzzah Wanda Coleman! P.S.

BEERSPIT NIGHT is an interesting entry into the volumes of Bukowski letters published by Black Sparrow. This is a venture between two people who were involved with Bukowski and Martinelli professionally and personally:  John Martin, publisher of BSP, and Steven Moore, the editor of this book, respectively. The correspondence is lively, Bukowski seems to have met his match, and enlightening. Bukowski, as Moore states, reveals more of his artistic and literary leanings with Martinelli than he did with anyone else he exchanged missives with (Martin and Bukowski's widow may be the only other people to have seen this side of him). The book appears to have been a labor-of-love for Moore, who knew Martinelli, and Martin shows his usual loving care with this book as he has with every other Buk book. The only problem I have encountered so far (at only 1/4 of the way through) is Moore's decision to leave much of the original purposeful misspellings and colloquialisms of both Bukowski and Martinelli. It becomes quite tiresome, like spending hours trying to solve word problems. And, for some reason the footnotes are not numbered, so many a reader may actually pass them over not realizing they're there.  Those who think they know everything about Bukowski might discover some revelations in these letters.	2001-04-26

There are many wonderful, never-before-seen photos of this the Quasimodo of Modern American Literature (and great photos of other folks as well). I do agree with the reviewers who think there are too many pictures of streets and places, however, I think the idea here is to give us an idea of the down and out lifestyle Buk lived (for much of his lilfe) and then how that all changed. I also agree with reviewer Jennifer that the picture with Silverstein is one of the best, and most surprising, in the bunch. Well, maybe not so surprising as they both submitted work to ... mags! A note to another reviewer about all the mistakes; first, some of the misspellings are actually British spellings of words (Sounes is British), and the copy I have, at least, is from a British publisher; second, it's not the author's fault there are misspellings or misinformation of any sort, that's the editor/publisher's fault (they're the ones who're supposed to check these things). But kudos to a careful reader. It's nice to see Steve Richmond reviewing books he obviously has a vested interest in, anything having to do with Buk that even so much as mentions him he's got to pontificate on. You're in the new book of letters too. Cheers, Steve. Anyway, a great book about a great writer.	2001-04-26

Dawson sees this as an  expansion of his art, extending beyond himself, out to other people and  their stories.

Krumhansl's labor of love is only for the die-hard Bukowski fanatic. It consists of descriptions of Buk's books, chapbooks, broadsides, and &quot;special&quot; magazine appearances (i.e. when Buk was the only, or  main, contributor). But if you're like me (a big fan), there was nothing  new to the book, I hadn't heard of maybe one or two of the items.  Regardless, the pictures, of some of the rarer pieces, and the history of  these publications, is imminently interesting. And the broadside poem,  available only in the deluxe editions of the book, is a knockout. Of  course, the collector (or ebay addict) can reference the book for print  runs, etc., to determine just how &quot;rare&quot; certain items are.  Krumhansl has done a great job cataloguing Buk's massive output (156 items  are listed, which is amazing in and of itself, but think of the tens of  thousands of magazine appearances Bukowski also had!), and has compiled a  last will and testament for one of this century's greatest writers!	1999-12-02

But anyone who loves to read the advanced guard of American Literature, knows that BSP is actually the leading independent publisher in the world. Looking through this scholarly resource book might seem dry (it basically describes the title page, size, layout, printing history, etc. but NOT reviews, or summaries of the books) to the uninititated, but for anyone serious about 20th Century American Literature this book is a necessity. The authors, besides Bukowski, that Black Sparrow has published in its 35 year history regularly fill anthologies of &quot;America's Best.&quot; Just to name a few, you'll find books by: Gertrude Stein, Cid Corman, Sam Shepard, Fielding Dawson, Micheal McClure, Joyce Carol Oates, Diane Wakoski, Wanda Coleman, Gerard Malanga, Tom Clark, Wyndham Lewis, D.H. Lawrence, Sherril Jaffe, David Bromige, Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, Ed Dorn, Paul Blackburn, etc., etc. New voices such as, Eileen Myles, Lucia Berlin, Andrei Codrescu, Lyn Lifshin, and Michael Lally come later in the press' history, and therefore their work is not compiled here. This is one of the two problems with this book; it's seriously outdated (representing only the first 12 years of BSP's existence), and the photos of the beautiful book covers and title pages are in black and white. Hopefully, they plan to do a new version for the coming millenium! Still, this volume is a valuable source material for scholars, collectors, and fans of the best of the best. Get this along with the bibliography of Bukowski's work by Aaron Krumhansl and start collecting!	1999-11-17

Howard Sounes' new Bukowski biography is much better than Cherkovski's BUKOWSKI: A LIFE, or Steve Richmond's self-serving SPINNING OFF BUKOWSKI; but it's still not great. He does dispel some of the Bukowski mythology  (which Bukowski himself was the main promoter of) that has grown over the  years. Unfortunately, he dwells too much on Bukowski's sex life, which can  be read about in two fat Bukowski books (in every Bukowski book really)  WOMEN and LOVE IS A DOG FROM HELL. This would be a good introduction for  the uninitiated, but for Buk fanatics it's nothing new. Try Gay Brewer's  wonderful CHARLES BUKOWSKI, for a more in depth (though somewhat academic)  look at what Bukowski is important for: HIS WRITING!
