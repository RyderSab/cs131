As he starts to uncover the truth about his family, his past and his future, Thomas questions concepts like family, friendship, good and evil.<br />This is a wonderful story, a great mystery and one that you'll want to read all the way through in one sitting!	2002-09-28

Nothing But the Truth, by Avi, is an interesting documentary/play that reads like a novel.  The voices of the different characters are clear, and rather than being boring, it is nicely broken up to keep you guessing about what is coming next?  What will the principal say next, what will the parents say?<br />This story can also jump start interesting discussions about rules and rights.  It is less about singing the Star Spangled Banner and more about having the right (or permission to do so).  The adults in this novel don't know why they are inforcing the rule, only knowing that they &quot;have to.&quot;  WHY???  <br />Highly Recommended!	2001-11-09
US	52909378	R332Z1UGWHKCFO	0670896888	742941884	Empress of the World	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Lovely story, well written, worth reading	Empress of the World is more than a story about two girls discovering their sexuality, it is about the force of teen friendships, the struggles teens face (and overcome), as well as the pressures teens endure from each other and their parents.<br />The romance between Nic and Battle is the focus of the story, but not for the sake of shock value.  Their falling in love is as lovely, innocent, and believable as any boy-girl story.  The other characters, Katrina, Issac, Kevin and Anne are all finding themselves as well, one summer at a camp for gifted children.	2001-09-12
US	52909378	R2PA79Y1KFQZLT	0440944597	638391927	The Chocolate War	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of the best books ever written- A MUST!	The Chocolate War is a multileveled masterpiece!  On the surface are Jerry and the other kids who attend a middle class private school, that seems to be religiously affiliated, but inside are issues of: authority, self-perception, puberty, decision making, good vs. evil, social responsibility, and so much more.  Of course the adults in this story are evil and rotten, as are some of the boys.  Jerry is the hero in more ways than one- sometimes vulnerable but always strong.  It is possible that Cormier wanted to blast religion in this novel, but I see him as empowering kids, to not simply lie down and let the world happen to them.<br />Don't I wish I'd read this book as a teenager?  YES I DO!	2001-07-25

I thought it was very well written with compelling characters (Angel is a very strong girl and I like to see that, especially when a love story is entertained), and I haven't stopped thinking about what Michael and Angel are, wondering when and if people like them will appear during my lifetime!  A great, quick read!	2001-07-25

As she unravels the mystery, she learns more than she expected to learn about her family, discrimination, and her responsibilities as a human being.<br />Macy grows tremendously throughout the novel, leaving behind her self centeredness and finally gaining empathy and understanding.<br />This book is well worth your time!	2001-07-25

US	52909378	R3HHAP4KNA5YM7	0152164561	29347266	Mary, Bloody Mary	Books	5	1	2	N	N	The perfect way for kids to learn about history	Carolyn Meyer weaves into an exciting story the young adult life of Mary Tudor.  Meyer's story sets up the legends about Mary, her piety and her disdain of her sister, Elizabeth.  The reader also learns about her father Henry VIII and his many wives.<br />I find this book compelling not only because it is a riveting story, but because it sneaks historical facts into the story in such a way that you don't realize you are LEARNING HISTORY!   After finishing this book I decided to read The children of Henry VIII by Alison Weir and find that it collaborates Meyer's story.  It seems to me that Meyer has not taken liberties with her novelization, as many authors do.<br />I think this kind of book would be an excellent compliment to a school curriculum!	2001-06-07

Each story in this collections seems to represent a facet of a girl's youth, whether it be dealing with her self imagine, or standing up and fighting for her dreams.  When read as a collection, I think these stories pull together to present a realistic picture of the trials faced by teen girls.	2001-05-22

Issues of change, death, boy-girl friendships, the nature of learning, and faith are all explored and then some.<br />In addition, this novel requires some &quot;research,&quot; if the full meaning of Almond's symbolism is to be understood. It is a great novel both for showing kids the stresses in life (sick little sister, drifting apart from friends), as well as teaching them about literary techniques (forshadowing, symbolism).	2001-05-22
US	52909378	R22EQA0J3KB843	1886910618	690123527	Cut	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Masterfully Written and Moving	After reading the jacket summary of this book, you may think, why would I ever want to read a book about &quot;cutters,&quot; but this book has something to offer to everyone.  Pat McCormick captures the teen voice in this book, feelings of confusion, guilt, superiority, and depression.  Though I wasn't a cutter myself, I remember having some of the same feelings S.T. has and never found a release for them as she did through self-mutilation.  Her desperation and desire for help is moving, though seemingly unwanted, and by the end of the novel you cry with hope for her future, as well as that of the adults in the novel. Speaking of the adults, they are neither altogether blamed, nor exonerated of guilt. <br />I would call this a masterpiece and VERY deserving of the Printz Award.	2001-05-13

Sally Warner writes a riviting story about a teen girl trying to keep it all together; trying to take care of her mother; and trying to keep it all her own business.<br />I think this book would also be great for parents suffering through paranoia and depression to see what their kids really go through.	2001-05-12

Weaver wrote many genres all into one thrilling, suspenseful story.  Miles Newell's ingenuity saves his family time and again.  His sister is the typical angst teen, with the hair cut and attitude to go with it.  Mr. &amp; Mrs. Newell are mostly self-centered, career driven, pedestal-speaking parents, who rely on Miles to keep them together.<br />I can't wait to read other books by this author.	2001-05-04

Regardless, I found so much to relate to in Stuck in Neutral.  As teenagers, many of us feel/felt like we couldn't be heard, or that we were stifled.  The reality of Stuck in Neutral shows so clearly that what appears to be so on the surface is not what lies beneath.	2001-03-22

I'm only half finished with the 4th installment of Harry Potter and his Hogwart's pals and I can't put it down!

However, beyond being intrigued by the idea of it, Into the Forest falls short of being even a good read.  The characters were not well  developed and some things did not make sense.  Incest?
