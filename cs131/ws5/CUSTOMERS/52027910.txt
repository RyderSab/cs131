Monkey Dancing is a charming story of a father and his two pre-teen children as they make their way through forming a new family dynamic, all the while touring some of the world's most endangered plants and animals. <br />The author tells about how he and his family were dealt a double upheaval-the death of his brother from breast cancer and his wife decided that she wanted to leave her marriage and family to start a new one with another women. The writing is clear and flows fluently all the while weaving a tale of vanishing forest, eat exotic foods, and dealing with the forming of a new family.	2004-05-23

David Heymann found an interesting topic to write about. The women of Washington have been written about, but this book capitalizes on a less told part of Washington. Heymann talks about the parties given by some of the movers and shakers, including Katharine Graham, whose death he opens with.  The author writes about the dinner parties and social events where deals were made and alliances formed, and the gossip that prevailed. <br />While the author found a unique topic to write about, he found very little new information. The bibliography cites hundreds of books and articles, yet he lacks new interviews or original information. Heymann also relies upon quoted material frequently, which was disappointing. In all I found myself wanting more fresh information but he found a great topic to write about.	2004-02-01

Alice Steinbach is for the first time in many years a truly \\"independent woman,\\" without the constraints of young children to take care of, a job that tethers her to an office, and other habits that define many of us. <br />Steinbach writes about her months in Europe and her journey into independence through Paris, Oxford, London, and Italy. Through her trip she meets a young girl getting married, women who she befriends, and a man she shares Paris with. Through these friends she writes about what it means to find herself again. Steinbach has many attention-grabbing insights into what it means to be an independent woman who chooses to look at her life through travel.	2003-07-06

The entire process is documented with a human touch in the Gatekeepers. The author followed several applicants and an admissions officer through the grueling process of assembling the Wesleyan class of 2004. The author details the lives of a half-dozen high school applicants and how emotionally taxing the college admissions process is for all sides. <br />The Gatekeepers provides quite a bit of insight into the admissions process. I was surprised to learn how personally admissions officers take the job of recruiting applicants they believe will impact their campus and how much they believe in their school. A good read to remember the college admissions process does not define a person.	2003-04-07

Sullivan joined Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign as an advance team member. She writes about the nuts-and-bolts of choosing the right podium-not to ostentatious, but not too plain- to planning her own large scale event in New York and having to secure a site with just a few hours to spare. Sullivan writes in a very fresh non-politically jaded voice, yet sometimes languishing to quotes from political books. Sullivan also helps a reader appreciate a candidate who is on the losing side and the work that goes into bringing issues to the American voter as well as a face to Bill Bradley and all political candidates.	2002-12-25

The book starts with Laber?s early life to a fortunate family. Yet, the real essence of the book comes into concentration when Laber begins to tell about the early human rights movement. She writes about traveling to communist countries to quietly meet with dissidents, smuggling her notes out of the countries, taking a contraband computer into a communist country, reporting on the horrors of torture, and other narratives to which many can only imagine. <br />All of these accounts are intertwined with stories about Laber?s personal life. She talks about her abrupt divorce, attempting to keep a balance between work and home life, and her dedication to the dissidents who relied upon her to tell their stories and bring aid to their plights. A very relevant book to the world we live in today, and a wonderful book chronicling the beginnings of Human Rights Watch.	2002-08-30

The book is broken down by seasons as the young boys describes the transformation his neighborhood takes during various times of the year.     I brought a copy of this book home very well expecting it to go on the bookshelf and to languish there until my son got older. I was pleasantly surprised that even at 18-months my toddler gravitated to the book and enjoys looking at the artwork.

Bradley Patterson fills his book with insight and information, yet the book is still very readable and anything but boring.  This is a non-fiction account of the White House and its offices.  It is not a biography nor is it one persons account of his year's in the White House.  It is very much a factual account of the daily workings of what takes place in government. This is a very interesting book that I would recommend for people interested in learning more about government.  It is also a very good resource for those who are doing research on the inner workings of the White House.	2001-06-06

The book also touches upon their roles in the political realm of the Kennedy world.  This book is an entertaining read, but disappointing as a biography.  The book is written in a very easy to understand and fun manner, yet the book has a slightly tabloid angle to it.  While the book is titled \\"Jackie Ethel Joan\\" much more attention is focused toward Jackie than Ethel and Joan.  Yet this is a good introduction to Ethel and Joan Kennedy's lives and their relationship to the rest of the Kennedy family.  In all this book was an amusing and easy read.	2001-05-02

The photographer, Robert McNeely, did a great job in choosing photographs that depict the life of a president.  It is apparent that McNeely choose shots that he thought would draw a reader into the book, versus standard press shots or pictures that have ran in thousands of magazines and newspapers.  I was a disappointed that McNeely didn't elaborate more on the pictures and tell about the events that led to the picture being taken or what happened after the picture was taken.  McNeely does give some insight into the Clinton presidency in the endnotes of his book.  In all a great book and a different view of the presidency.	2000-11-22

The book tells about why these women entered into politics and how they rose to become a Senator of the United States, a position only held by 100 people at any given time.  These nine women Senators also told about their political interest and work and why they believe it is important to the country, particularly to women.  <br />While this book was written by women, and in many ways is about women, the book is not a feminist debate nor does the book bash upon men.  The book does tell about the efforts it took for these women to reach the positions they are now in, and why they believe in inspiring the next generation of Senators.  This is an easy reading book, perhaps appropriate for Jr. High School students and older.	2000-10-06

The Americans profiled in Kasich's easy reading book could  be your neighbor, co-worker, or even you.  Their profiles tell the stories  of everyday people who take the time to help others, display unquestionable  amounts of courage, and provide an inspiration to those who meet them.   <br />Kasich's profiles include stories of Geoffrey Canada (author of Fist  Stick Knife Gun) who crusades against violence, brothers Eric and Bobby  Krenzke who suffer from a hereditary illness yet triumph in their life, a  young girl who provides lunches for the homeless, a retired doctor who  provides medical services to people who otherwise could not afford medical  care, a holocaust survivor shares with younger generations the tragedy of  World War II, and many other stories of courage that will hopefully inspire  and make you want to share this book with others.<br />If you enjoyed this  book \\"Heroes After Hours\\" written by David C.

The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his  material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein)  and articles about the Kennedy family.  Andrews does not divulge deeply  into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or  information to make this book worth reading.  As another reviewer stated,  this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of  the book.  A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other  news magazine reports and other books about the subject.	2000-08-17

Lieberman further describes how this conversation motivated him to  write this book, in defense of politics and public life.  From this opening  prologue I expected to read about the \\"success\\" stories of Lieberman and  others in passing legislation, helping a constituent, or making sweeping  changes that would motivate people into running for office.<br />Yet, this  book is much more realistic, it provides the `real' spin on public life.   Lieberman's style of writing draws upon many of his own experiences to aid  in the understanding of what it takes to be a public official.  From these  examples Lieberman hopes that the reader will understand the sacrifices,  long hours, partisanship, sacrifices of family and personal freedom  required to live a life in public office.  Lieberman further hopes that  this book will motivate people to take a part in public life in varying  degrees- from voting, contacting elected officers, or perhaps running for  office.  In all, this slim book is a decent read and very interesting in  understanding a different side of politics.	2000-08-15

These topics provide the basic knowledge of  political science and comparative politics.<br />Roskin looks at six  countries, including the traditional countries under study- Great Britain,  Germany, France, Russia, and Japan, to the less well-known political  systems of Brazil, South Africa, and Iran.  These countries provide a  contrasting study of countries on various levels (politically,  economically, and geographically).  While Roskin did take care in providing  a mix of countries to study, several geographical regions, such Asia and  South East Asia region are underrepresented, but this is to be expected  with an introductory book to comparative politics.  <br />The book is also  written in easy to understand language.  This allows the reader to grasp  the meaning behind the concepts being introduced.  At the end of each  chapter Roskin provides a list of vocabulary building words to help  facilitate the learning and focus the reader's attention on some of the  important concepts.  Roskin also attempts to engage the reader with  text-boxes, which spotlight a person, topic, or political thought.  These  text-boxes are very interesting and further allows the reader to understand  some of the isocracies of the country being studied.  While these  text-boxes do allow for a greater study of the country a reader should also  keep in mind that this is an introductory book and therefore the book tends  to gloss over many of the complex and complicated concepts and issues of  comparative politics.<br />The sixth edition of this book is a bit outdated in  its material on its material, particularly to Russia.  But overall this  book is a good introduction to comparative politics and political science.	2000-08-09

It is no doubt that the photos chosen to receive the Pulitzer recognize human nature at its most extreme- compassion and brutality. This  book is a collection of the most famed and heartwrenching photographs over  a spanning several decades.  Included in the collection are pictures from  the Vietnam War, Oklahoma City bombing, famine, rites of passage, parents  standing next to the ocean which swept their son to sea, election of U.S.  President Clinton, and other events of various magnitude.  The pictures  (both black/white and color) are printed on large heavy paper, which allows  the true nature of the picture to project their true nature.  <br />One of the  best aspects of this book is the short narratives that accompany each  picture.  The narratives answer many questions about the picture, such as  what the photographer was thinking, his intention with the photo, how he  came across the situation, his feelings, and so forth.  I found the  narratives to be one of the most gratifying aspects of this book.<br />This is  a wonderful collection of photographs that will make you think about life  at its extremes, and therefore appreciate everyday life.	2000-07-28

The author, Ruth Rocha, rewrote parts of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights to help children understand this subject.  Rocha reduces the Declaration's articles into easily understood one or two line sentences.  This allows children to grasp the essence of human rights, and makes the book a great introduction to human rights.  <br />The illustrations are a great addition to the book.  The simple watercolor designs of people supplement the authors words without distracting or overtaking the meaning.  Thus allows children to use their immagination and comprehend what human rights means to them.<br />This a nice introduction to human rights and a great book for young children.

The author of this book, Ann Blackman, did a wonderful job examining the finer details of Albright's  life.  Blackman interviewed numerous people, including President Clinton,  and other close friends and colleagues of Albright, which helps the reader  understand the importance of Albright in the worldwide community.  Yet, all  of these interviews and information are buried in the back of the book.   Blackman spends too much time focusing on Albright's father, Josef Korbel,  and how Madeleine Albright's family ended up in the United States.  While  this information is important in understanding why Albright believes in the  politics that she believes in, it does not do the reader any good if they  cannot get through the inital chapters.  This is a well researched and  through book on Albright's life, a decent book if you do not get lost in  the history.	2000-07-24

The book is well written with an ease of  understanding, and it is easily understood by the general American public.   It is in this ease of understanding that the authors loss a certain edge  necessary to being a well written piece of work.<br />The formating of the  book allows the authors present a case study for a better government, such  as a new way of budgeting, then presenting a specific example of where and  how this worked for one specific form of government.  Yet, the authors  failed to document other examples which would have strengthened their case  studies.  The authors also failed to mention the drawbacks to such methods  of government, leaving one to believe that if government were to implement  all of the concepts in their book we would be living in a Utopia.  <br />In  all, a disappointing book in despreate need of someone to challenge the  concepts and force the writers to provide a stronger piece of work.	2000-07-21

Children will appreciate the detailed and well chosen artwork and the short passages contributed by children from around the world.  The passages come in the form of poems, letters, interviews, and narratives.  These passages are short and easily accesible to both children and adults.  While the book does attempt to give a balanced view of human rights, some ethnocentric and unbalanced reporting did come through.  In several cases the authors failed to explain the reasons behind human right violations.  In this respect, Stand Up for Your Rights is a good resource manual for teachers and parents to go over with children, who can supplement the book with discussion or other resources.  At the end of the book is a listing of organizations and ways for children to get involved with human right causes.  In all, this is a gook book about human rights and I believe children will appreaciate it as well.	2000-07-19

The author, Irma McClaurin, attempts to tell  the story of three Belize women, each coming from different walks of life.   McClaurin tells each womens story from their perspective and captures the  lives they live- facing such issues as divorce, relationship with males,  ownership of property, marriage, domestic violence, and most importantly  how they, as women, factor into each of these issues.  McClaurin does a  wonderful job of telling the story of these women, yet from an  anthropological/social science perspective she does not report on the  consistency of her research methodology nor the ethics behind her research  (example: how forming bonds with the women may have driven the results). A  very interesting book for people interested in the Caribbeans, women's  studies, or cultural anthropology.	2000-07-19

This is a must read for all WWII historians, it provides a different account of the war and the untold  efforts that went into the war effort.  The authors details in her letters  home carry the spirit and humor of those who served with the Red Cross  overseas.<br />I have had the pleasure of meeting several of the women who  served with American Red Cross overseas.  They are truly wonderful women,  who continue to serve their country, community, and the Red Cross with the  compassion and spirit that Rosemary describes in Dearest Ones.  Keeping in  mind many of these women are grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, they  have more energy, happiness, and effervescence than I do at 22- they are  truly irreplaceable and inspiring.  Read this book to capture their love,  inspiring nature, and the sparkle of their unique lives.	2000-07-18
