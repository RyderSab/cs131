I saved this great adventure for vacation and just couldn't put it down. Croke manages to incorporate what is clearly years of research into a breathtaking adventure. Shanghai, the wilds of China near the Tibetan border, the turmoil as war gathered over Asia... it's all there. She's got a compelling heroine in Harkness, a self-made woman who learned to put on a brave face and do what was necessary. And she manages to show Harkness's growth, as well, as she sees what her panda success is beginning to do to the species. Her response -- which I won't give away -- brought me to tears, and shows why Croke, a gifted writer and wildlife advocate, chose to tell her story. This is a thrilling book, with a flawed but admirable heroine. A wonderful adventure between the covers!!	2005-08-24

Knowing record collectors and not really being one myself, I was curious to see what the author would do with this particular geeky subculture. I expected the research -- the really wierd stories (well, some of them) and the celebrity collectors (R. Crumb and his 78s make a particularly interesting portrait). What I hadn't expected was the warmth and the humor that runs throughout, making this a very enjoyable read. The author clearly has affection for his subjects -- he says he's one of them -- and the light touch of his music journalism informs this book with quite a few laughs.	2003-10-27

These are the big questions facing Sarah Smith's two academic detectives, the blue-collar Joe and upperclass Posy, as they set out on a race to prove the authenticity of a Shakespeare letter that Joe has stumbled across in his research. The letter could change scholarship as we know it: it purports to be from the Avon-based player, and it seems to say that he didn't write the plays attributed to his name but that a nobleman borrowed his name. Joe, of course, wants the real working-man to be the plays' author, but Posy is leaning toward someone more of her own social standing, and both have good cases that draw them from Boston to England and into each others' arms. So -- did Shakespeare write the letter? Did he write the plays? Drawing on actual, ongoing literary debates, Smith creates a lively, contemporary mystery with two engaging characters who end up finding out as much about themselves as they do about the playwright they both love.	2003-06-25

I picked this book up on a whim and was amply rewarded -- not only does Fulmer bring historical characters (such as Buddy Bolden, Lulu White, and - very briefly - a young Louis Armstrong) alive, he places them perfectly in their city in their time (the flooding, the banquettes, even the use of terms like \\"lucifer\\" for what we now call a match). Well written, with believable people and good musical description, this was just a not-to-be-put-down read. OK, maybe it's not quite  \\"Coming Through Slaughter\\" (Michael Ondaatje's masterful recreation of Bolden's life), but it beats the hell out of a lot of other mysteries that trade off the Crescent City's allure. This reader eagerly awaits Fulmer's next book.	2003-06-17

I loved this book when I first got it because it was full of fun and interesting advice on everything from grooming to training. The discussions of declawing, etc., were thoughtful, practical, and wise. <br />Then, when my beloved Cyrus started to fail, I reluctantly turned to the section on geriatric cats and although in some ways it confirmed my worst fears (Cyrus's kidneys were failing) the information and advice was given in such a way as to be comforting. Remember, Spadafori wrote, cats live in the day. This was wonderful advice and helped me appreciate Cyrus's last good times. <br />I put the book aside for quite a while after that, but when the idea of a new pet no longer seemed like sacrilege, I pulled it out again and read about &quot;road testing&quot; kittens. And now that the rambunctious Musetta is a year old, I'm reading those sections on training again and just loving it. <br />This is a book for all cat lovers, at any stage of your or your cat's life. - Clea Simon, author &quot;The Feline Mystique: On the Mysterious Connection Between Women and Cats&quot;	2002-06-10

By switching voices -- from two very different young girls to their mothers to such side characters as a serving maid -- Chevalier creates a fully fleshed portrait out of few words, each voice has its distinct viewpoint and very believable vocabulary and tone. The story that these voices build is wonderful and tragic, a realistic tale of the early 20th century. One brief paragraph, in particular, took my breath away -- only two sentences, but no more were needed. Afterward, entranced, I picked up her first novel and although I enjoyed it, I found it clumsy and verbose in comparison. <br />This is a much less conventional novel, but (I think) a superior one.

While I've utterly enjoyed Bourdain's offhand, conversational style in his earlier books (particularly Kitchen Confidential and Bone in the Throat), here it sounds too casual. For all his assertions in KC that he just wakes up and writes a bit, writing is a craft and this time out the author does not pay enough attention to it. Too bad -- the story (which was probably largely researched by others, according to the acknowledgments) is interesting, and Bourdain's take on it is fresh. But sloppy writing -- repeated words and phrases, cliches, etc. -- really slow down this short tome. If this were a dish, I doubt Bourdain would have let it out of his kitchen, and someone at Bloomsbury should have pointed this out.	2001-06-29
