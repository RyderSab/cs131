Making bystanders just as accountable as the bully themselves, Ms. Coloroso sharply criticizes how today's society seems to focus only on the bully's ACT instead of the underlying feelings which cause such behavior.<br /><br />She encourages parents and \\"responsible adults\\" to get involved in the hallways, playgrounds, and streets of our children's world. Not at all defeatist, Ms. Coloroso's attitude is one of seeking to break the cycle of violence through love, communication, and consequence.<br /><br />All teachers, school administrators and parents of children all ages should grab a copy, pencil in hand to underline the nuggets of wisdom Ms. Coloroso offers us. She hands us the solution to a prevalent problem for kids. It is our job to relax our fists long enough to receive what she has to say and to implement it through the doable exercises she puts forth.

In fact, it was with great hesitance that I finished reading the book to my daughter. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Given the contemporary climate of speech control and the like, broaching the subject of gender differences is a dangerous thing. David T. Greenberg does it with grace, humor, and a necessary amount of tongue and cheek. Using language a child would, he mimicks what is said on playgrounds and in school halls and in the minds of girls and boys.<br /><br />From blaming flatulance on members of the opposite sex to pointing towards their lack of hygiene, Greenberg gives voice to both sides of the story. Children will laugh, grin, and agree that boys and girls are different, but they can be cool, uproarious, glorious and wondrous, too.	2005-08-01
US	33661526	R1FEOGN1W2BNJW	0316985600	851169000	Click Here: To Find Out How I Survived Seventh Grade	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Are you there, blog? It's me, Erin...	Denise Vega's \\"Click Here\\" is narrated by seventh grader Web geek, Erin Swift. The book begins with her pre-teen angst as she discovers that her best friend, Jilly, and she will not be on the same track when they begin middle school in the fall. Erin undergoes many changes during the book: from being at odds with her best friend to falling in deep like with Cute Boy aka Mark Sacks. Along the way, she pounds the class bully, ignores her own feelings to please Jilly by being in a ridiculous Thanksgiving play, and heads up the school's Intranet team.<br /><br />Ms. Vega cleverly taps into her protagonist's psyche by using a personal blog which only Erin is supposed to see. She keeps her reader informed by listing what makes her happy and sad. The reader is the proverbial fly on the wall, peering into Erin's inner world with the click of a mouse.<br /><br />What used to be the school newspaper committee has turned into the Intranet Club in the 21st century. Ms. Vega masters the esprit de corps of today's middle school environment, complete with embarassing moments of self-revelation, awkward almost kisses, and love-sick nerds who leave bad poetry in other people's lockers. She equally captures the timeless essence of pubescent moodiness. She portrays good-natured adults such as the Intranet Club's leading teacher, Ms. Moreno, and the janitor who divvies out lollipops and lessons to Erin along the way, people the reader might wish were as uncomplicated and wholeheartedly loving in real life.<br /><br />The reader will recognize her own twelve-year-old self in this book, reminding us all of the pain we went through in growing up. While Ms. Vega depicts a rather mature (and at times unbelievable) Erin Swift, her book is so ejoyable that the reader will forgive her for it. Denise Vega is to today's teens what Judy Blume was to the teens of the 70's and 80's. The only difference is the question Erin asks: \\"Are there blog? It's me, Erin...\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Click Here\\". It is a timely, funny, can't-put-down read!ny, can't-put-down read!	2005-07-18

Books	5	6	6	N	N	Raising the Scepter of Cultural Change	Grab the Queen Power is a personal, yet universal quest for capturing the divine inner voice we all recognize as children. Author Allyn Mitchell Evans shares a touching, heartfelt story about her journey from self-conscious youth to powerful woman. Using the queen archetype in a richly unique way, Ms. Evans delves deeply into the social mores which kept her in shackles for almost four decades.<br /><br />Her origins in Mississippi left her questioning why demure, soft-spoken girls got preference over vocal, self-confident ones. Hers is a story not unlike many Southern women who are constrained by convention and the acute suspicion of strong-willed women quickly pigeonholed as a Scarlett O'Hara. While her Southern background might cause some readers to say, \\"This does not apply to me,\\" they will soon realize their own culturally imposed limitations, chaining them to tradition and a sense of \\"We cannot change what is so.\\"<br /><br />Allyn Mitchell Evans challenges each of us to change \\"what is so\\" into what is real: our own personal power mixed with a passion to make a difference in our own lives and those of others. If you have ever visited her Web site, [...] you will quickly realize she means what she says. She has not only dedicated the last three years of her life to research this fine book, but she also continues to strive for change in a medium which suits her well - the written word.<br /><br />I highly recommend Grab the Queen Power to anyone searching for their lost selves. They will soon find them within the pages of her book, tiara and all.<br /><br />Christine Louise Hohlbaum, official SAHM expert for ClubMom, award-winning American writer and author of Diary of a Mother: Parenting Stories and Other Stuff (2003) and SAHM I Am: Tales of a Stay-at-Home Mom in Europe (2005), lives near Munich, Germany with her husband and two children.

That is, until I picked up a copy of Matt Christopher Â® Legends in Sports: Muhammad Ali. This compact book fills its 118 pages with so much interesting commentary and history about Muhammed Ali that I read the entire thing in one sitting.<br /><br />Glenn Stout conveys the boxing great's image with great skill. From a cocky teen to a mature man with a purpose, Muhammed Ali takes us all on a journey into the passion of a sport widely misunderstood. Stout is able to show us the skill behind the sport, the dedication and the hard work involved to make a master out of a mouthy middle-class kid.<br /><br />Despite the topic, the book never falls prey to graphic descriptions. Its matter-of-fact tone makes it a perfect book for middle school children who are looking for a hero. They'll find what they seek in Muhammed Ali.

The reader witnesses Sunita's transformation from a shy, angry youth to a more mature teenager who celebrates her place in the world.<br /><br />Feeling different is a common theme in teen literature. Sunita feels at odds with her environment because her carefully scripted assimilation into American culture is rudely interrupted by the arrival of her grandparents. Her mother is suddenly bustling about the kitchen, wearing a sari and reeking of curry. Sunita is embarrassed at her mother's transformation and seeks to hide her own identity from the people she loves dearly. Her relationships with others suffer, but most of all, Sunita's relationship with herself suffers the greatest loss.<br /><br />Ms. Perkins' well-written prose places the reader right in the midst of a contemporary teen dilemma. Giving the reader the sense that she has lived the story herself, Ms. Perkins handles the topic of multicultural identity with great alacrity. The reader feels compassion towards Sunita as she struggles to gain her personal freedom amidst rumor mills, peer pressure and the aromas of a distant land.<br /><br />Sunita's relationship to her grandfather remains a constant staple throughout the book. His wisdom, calm and ability to handle conflict with grace will help the young reader find her own way in the maze of adolescence.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Not-So-Star-Spangled Life of Sunita Sen.

Carol Weston has proven once again that she can entertain and educate at the same time. Her latest children's book, With Love From Spain, Melanie Martin, provides an amusing linguistic travel adventure for kids ages 8 and up. Adults will chuckle and relate to the main character of Melanie, who feels the pain and confusion of first love while filling her senses with the compelling Spanish landscape.<br /><br />The Martin family band together for a two-week Spring break vacation as seen through the eyes of eleven-year-old Melanie. The author offers her readers a consistent, even tone throughout the book.  Melanie's sometimes childish, sometimes teenage view of the world sets the stage for all that the Martin family experiences. From art museums to foreign cuisine, the author takes the reader with her wherever she goes. An additional plus to the book is that she phonetically spells the Spanish words that the fictitious Melanie learns. I found myself saying some of the words aloud and learning quite a few things along the way. An appendix of all the foreign words Ms. Weston used would have been an added benefit to the book.<br /><br />You can almost smell the musty old four-hundred year-old paintings and taste the fresh pescado in the various bars and outdoor restaurants in which Melanie and her clan dine. One of my favorite lines in the book comes in the section \\"Angel's apartment, incredibly late\\". The author writes: \\"Spaniards don't believe in bedtime. They believe in nighttime.\\" The cultural differences are fascinating to the reader, made all the more real by Melanie's enthusiasm and joie de vivre.<br /><br />Luckily, Ms. Weston does not harp too long on the lovesick side of Melanie which could, to the adult reader, have become tiresome fairly quickly. Nonetheless, the reader is satisfied with the outcome of Melanie's relationship to the Spanish Migue who is 1 Â½ years her senior. Readers will be relieved to know that they can read more about Melanie and Miguel in the fourth book in the series: Melanie in Manhattan.<br /><br />With Love From Spain, Melanie Martin will make you want to take your kids on a European adventure of your own, no matter where you live in the world!

In an extremely clear and concise fashion, the author lays out definitions of the various spiritual dimensions and encourages every reader with step-by-step exercises to consciously leave their bodies at night.<br /><br />The book is broken down into nine week sessions. In each chapter, Belzebuub explains the topic (such as what astral travel and dreams actually are), then includes a question and answer section from actual students in previous courses. The Q&A adds an interactive component to the book, giving the reader the answer to his own questions without actually having to ask them. I found this part particularly useful as it answered questions raised in my mind throughout the chapter. There is some repetition in the author's answers, but the patient reader will forgive him for that. It serves to reinforce the simplicity of the exercise. An additional section follows the Q&A which outlines the exercise of the week. The author offers practical Web link references such as the sound of the mantra the reader should repeat, thereby enhancing the entire reading experience.<br /><br />\\"A Course in Astral Travel and Dreams\\" should be taken as an augmentation to the free online course offered at [...] I imagine most readers would lose confidence without the interaction of a group setting as it is extremely difficult to follow  through with the exercises without guided support. The book offers novice astral travellers a chance to taste a new dimension and raise their awareness to a level they never knew existed before reading the book.<br /><br />This is not your typical out-of-body experience book. It challenges the reader to probe the spiritual realm in a methodical and purposeful way.

Books	3	1	1	N	N	Passion and Ignorance	Margaret Broderick has penned a red-hot account of her trials and tribulations after living her dream and then watching it dismantled by incompetent professionals. She and her partner, Angee, decide to establish a winery in the heart of the Midwest - in Indiana. Despite the conservative political slant of the State, their company evolves into an internationally recognized winery within a few short years. Angee suffers from a debilitating autoimmune disease, lupus, which causes her joint and back pain in erratic and untimely moments.<br /><br />At one point, despite their relative success, the two partners decide to close down their operation. With an organized 90-day closing plan, they naively believe the bank will accept their terms and be happy that everything was paid off on time. Not so. In fact, their ordeal is drawn out over 18 months, with a forced auction and an impending foreclosure on their home of over ten years. Countless accounts of meetings with blind lawyers and disrespectful bankers leave the reader wishing for a light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />The tone of the book vascillates between victorious over small wins in their fight with the bank and aggressive frustration over the seemingly endless emails and uncaring of so many people with whom they were forced to deal. If you are looking for uplifting literature about a small, women-owned operation in the Midwest, you will be sorely disappointed. The book is filled with disillusionment, frustration, anger, and despair.<br /><br />The book's funniest moments are in the chapter \\"A Fellini Film: Casting and Lessons\\" which details the various characters that worked at Gaia wines. From the impeccable gay man who pilfered wine from various shadowy corners of the store to the intern who couldn't stay awake after late-night beer runs, they are tickling moments which reveal Ms. Broderick's wit and keen eye for what's wrong with other people.<br /><br />When she transfers that same keen eye to the professionals with whom she deals, the reader is left to wonder how much is fact and how much was the author's misunderstanding what was actually happening. At one point towards the end of the book, Ms. Broderick quotes her hard-as-nails lawyer who is fed up with the author's monthly questions about points she wishes Ms. Broderick would leave up to the lawyer. At the same time, the reader understands the author's point of view and shares her indignation in the fraud and deceit that came into play.<br /><br />Passion v.

In her book, \\"One Paycheck at a Time\\", she guides the reader by the hand in an easy-to-follow step-by-step process to becoming debt-free. There is no sensation, no empty promises. She challenges the reader to apply the principles along with hardwork, discipline and perseverance. Without asking them to live an ascetic lifestyle, she asks the reader to assess his current situation with a master plan to beat the debt. While I have a debt-free lifestyle, I found myself rethinking how I approach spending money and immediately taking action to ensure I never \\"sink in the hole\\". Her book is useful not only for people who are currently in debt, but also for those who wish to maximize their cash flow by thinking smart about where their money goes.<br /><br />Her non-judgemental tone takes the shame away from being in debt. She has been there herself, and after digging her way out of $25,000 in credit card charges accumulated by her gambling ex-husband, she applied her prolific financial knowledge to help others, too. Her sometimes hilarious suggestions such as literally soaking your credit card in water until it freezes in the freezer are so outrageous that they work! Reader beware. Credit card plastic melts in the microwave!<br /><br />Griffiths requires the reader to shift his thinking completely about paying back debt on a monthly basis. After all, she reasons, you are usually paid more often than that. \\"Stop thinking you have to pay creditors once a month - those are their terms, not yours, especially if you're paid more than once a month.\\" Her suggestions simply make sense.<br /><br />Her simple exercises motivate the reader with her take-charge attitude. \\"One Paycheck at a Time\\" is an inspirational example of how anything is possible with the right tools. Kimberly Griffiths offers them to us all for the taking. Her book is an incredible investment in your future.

The authors warn not to place all your eggs in one basket or spend your pennies on useless junk that will end up costing you more in the end.<br /><br />The examples are generic with age-appropriate examples such as comic books, bicycles and newspaper routes.

Having grown up reading Erma Bombeck, I have read the funniest and the finest in my day. Tim Bete's humor, laced with a God-based perspective, anchors his stories in every day life in a way Erma Bombeck never did. It makes his writing unique and honest -- a cut above the rest.<br /><br />His wild imagination combined with a nurturing sensitivity towards his progeny makes this quick and fun read very enjoyable. One of my favorite lines comes from his imaginary tale of his home life played out as a movie:<br /><br />\\"There is only one human being in sight. Except for the tormented look on her face, she looks vaguely familiar - almost wife-like. She sits mute on the couch with her head in her hands. I ask her how her day was. She glares.\\" As a writer and stay-at-home mom, I laughed for ten minutes straight. See, see! Some men do see their wives the way we see ourselves.<br /><br />From thinking his children are monkeys taking over the Earth to marveling at his son's recycling ability, Bete offers his readers a much-needed break from the mundane, turning our very lives into miracles, too. Thank you, Mr. Bete, for the reminder that God is with us, even when (or maybe because?) there are graham cracker crumbs in our pockets.<br /><br />Christine Louise Hohlbaum, American expat author of Diary of a Mother (2003) and SAHM I Am: Tales of a Stay-at-Home Mom (May 2005), resides with her family near Munich, Germany.

Without being overly politically correct, author JAne Naliboff offers her readers a realistic context to discuss diversity without the typical exclusion that takes place when differences are a part of the equation. Naliboff underscores each of our unique qualities without preference for one over the other.<br /><br />The main character, Jennifer, is the only Jewish child in her class. She emphasizes her uniqueness by founding her own club, \\"The Only One Club.\\" As the other classmates aren't allowed to join, Jennifer notices how inclusion, not exclusion, is the true solution to her dilemma of wishing to be separate, but equal. She seeks each classmate's individual attribute and offers a membership to each one of them for being the \\"only one\\" to possess a certain quality.<br /><br />\\"The Only One Club\\" is a celebration of difference within a group setting.

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Empowering story of love, trust, and communication	Realizing the Power of Love: How a Father and Teenage Daughter Became Best Friends...and How You can, Too! by the father-daughter writing team V. Michael Santoro and Jennifer Santoro offers its readers a roadmap for an important family dynamic: the relationship between fathers and daugthers.<br /><br />Instead of having a fear-based conversation, the authors suggest helpful alternatives to the typical \\"Because I said so!\\" statements we exasperated parents use to silence our children. Narrated from the perspective of one hard-working father, the book acts as an intimate investigation into a specific relationship between father and daughter. While their story may not apply to every person's situation, I felt drawn to the narrative for its empowering simplicity. `Speak to your teen as an adult' resonated throughout the book. Offer guidelines, not a strict codex that only a military could enforce. Recognize your child's ability to handle things. Allow your child to make mistakes while acting as his or her safety net. It may be easier said, or written, than done, but the gentle reminder gives the reader a renewed perspective on a potentially troublesome area in parents' lives. Raising teens today is not easy, the authors admit. They survived the teen years with a lot of communication, some arguments, and a whole lot of trust. In an era of entrenched cynicism, Realizing the Power of Love is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Christine Louise Hohlbaum, American-born book reviewer, award-winning writer and author of the world-renowned Diary of a Mother, lives near Munich, Germany with her husband and two children.

Duval's 13 poems, each separated by an image of the American flag, is deeply rooted in both patriotic and religious belief in the project \\"America\\". One of my favorite lines in the book comes from her eleventh poem, \\"Rebuilding Twin Steeples: The Sacred Temples of Individual Lives and The Signature Buildings of Our Cities.\\" Duval writes: \\"We cannot rebuild unless we follow, The blueprint of the Master Builder, For we cannot rebuild unless the foundations are firmly established in Him; For truly, we'll labor in vain, If we seek to establish our own fragile foundations.\\" The truth of these words ring in the reader's minds. Duval warns the readers to look first to their own hearts before rebuilding in the physical realm.<br /><br />Duval's work reaches beyond the Christian belief system to touch to the heart of the matter. We cannot rely on our own principles to rebuild the world to a place of harmony and grace. A Higher Power, whether it be named God or some other term, must accompany our journey to find peace in this world. Duval encourages her readers to rise above, dear sister and brothers, to see the beauty in the brokenness and to reach for a greater harmony embedded in the Spirit of humanity.<br /><br />Christine Louise Hohlbaum, American-born book reviewer, award-winning writer and author of the world-renowned Diary of a Mother, lives near Munich, Germany with her husband and two children.

Filled with delightful, loving examples from the author's own experience, How to Be A Family reads much like an operating manual with a touch of personal journaling thrown in. He offers useful, if somewhat obvious, tips which serve as a reminder of the reason we had a family in the first place.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was Chapter 14 about family meetings. The way he described his occasional family meetings evoked images of the family in the TV show 7th Heaven, another great example of how a communicative family can yield a cohesive unit of loving and loved human beings.<br /><br />Chapter 9, which covers a broad range of issues about school, was also extremely helpful. Schiffer cautions parents to be involved without exhausting themselves. It is particularly useful to read this section if your children haven't reached school age yet.<br /><br />Schiffer has a way of conveying practical information without sounding judgmental or preachy. How to Be a Family has the right blend of advice and personal example without feeling as if you are an observer. Schiffer gives his readers a road map by which they can gauge their own journey. The author takes a holistic approach to family life by stressing the partnership upon which the entire family is based. If the parents don't have a strong partnership, chances are the family won't thrive either. He is not just child-centered, which many parenting books are. He also sees the parents' perspective and honors their needs as well.<br /><br />Schiffer's How to Be a Family is a tremendous guidebook for all families, regardless of race, creed or religion. It could act as the Constitution for All Parent-Child Relations, one based on love, understanding, compassion, and respect. Reading his book felt like a warm, and much-needed, hug.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It made a difference in how I view the relationship I have with my own children.

While her plot line sustained my interest for most of the book, Ms. Matthews made the mistake of telling, not showing her readers how great her protagonist, Sadie, really was. Her slapstick antics made her character flat, not warm or someone to which readers could truly relate. We got beaten over the head with how poor Sadie was and we were to fall in love with her for her simple, uncomplicated personality. She seemed more a fool than a lover throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Ms. Matthews wrote the book as if it were a screenplay. She found the right topic, just the wrong medium to convey her story. I can easily imagine Greg Kinnear as the quirky, I-must-act-or die waiter, Tavis; Mini Driver as the bumbling Sadie; Bruce Willis as the well-meaning, yet sorely misguided Gil; and Goldie Hawn as the luscious lush, Gina. I wish Carole Matthews well in her pursuits. It seems she has Hollywood pegged to a tee.	2004-08-10

Her thoughtful essays interweave the right amount of personal stories to give the reader the feeling that Braner has been there, too. I will never look at my &quot;skinny jeans&quot; in the same way; nor will I engage in negative self-talk, which so many mothers do.

Breaking down the stages of her daughter's development from infancy to adulthood, each phase is represented by a dance: Waltz, Jitterbug, Tango, Samba, and Freestyle.<br />In the first section, Waltz, she shows a warmth and willingness to raise her daughter with dream-like wonder. Toddlerhood emerges in Jitterbug, and the dreams are less surreal. She tackles reality head on, for instance, in the poem \\"Mother Magic,\\" which speaks to the heart of motherhood. Ferrer describes her daughter's foul mood as she awakens from her nap. With great triumph, she pulls her daughter out of her \\"royal huff.\\"  All the while, she acknowledges her own mother strength. Her daughter, the \\"Royal Highness\\" breaks out of her mood, declaring her ability to break the magic spell \\"because I am a Princess and I can do anything!\\" Ferrer looks on and replies inwardly, \\"Well, well. I am a mother, and I can, too.\\"<br />Tango and Samba are both heart-breaking and witty. We know our daughters will say they hate us, but we dread the day it arrives. Ferrer removes the chrage of her daughter's emotions with supreme love and banter. Pressing her daughter clean her room, Ferrer treats this common issue with such grace and fun: \\"fill your ears with the mighty music of the vacuum cleaner, your lungs with the derelict dust of this dreadful domain.\\" The reader can virtually smell the odiferous wet towel seeping mildew into the carpet.<br />Freestyle witnesses a mother's mixed emotions of letting go and wanting to hold on tight forever. The wisdom she imparts to her daughter as she prepares her wedding is telling of her love and affection. Ferrer's desire to give her daughter the world is palpable throughout the collection. She manages not only to offer up a \\"place you call Home\\" for her daughter, but a poetic respite for her readers, too.<br />The cadance of her poetry resembles a dance. Sometimes it is a Western swing, other times a true waltz. Harmony and discord meet in her lines. Mothers and daughters clash, cry, yell, and console each other through life's passions. Dancing with My Daughter is a wonderful companion for any mother or daughter who dreams big dreams, lives life with passion, and seeks the very best that this world has to offer.<br />Christine Louise Hohlbaum, American author of Diary of a Mother (2003), SAHM I Am (2005), and \\"American Housewife Abroad\\" at AnotherChapter.com, is a freelance writer living near Munich, Germany, with her husband and two children.

Her premise is simple: there are distinct parallels between the Salem witch trials and the United States' present handling of the war against terrorism. Her somewhat lengthy descriptions of key players such as Increase and Cotton Mather, William Stoughton and John Hathorne in the late seventeenth century reveal her in-depth knowledge of that time period in American history. Where she falls short is in her portrayals of today's political figures such as Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush. The reader is left wanting more information, which may not be readily available, to determine why the Bush Administration is acting in such a manner today.<br />While her arguments may be weakened by the imbalance in treating the Salem witch trials in great detail and the war in Iraq, for instance, in under a few pages, the reader is left to wonder if there isn't some truth to Hill's assessment. A fanatical religious ideologue, Cotton Mather suffered from paranoia and an exaggerated sense of self. He strove his entire life to meet his father's expectations. In doing so, he went to great lengths, often persecuting others, to prove his own worthiness. Similarly, George W. Bush suffers from trying to please his father even now. The fact that he hates reading makes it all the stranger that, after learning about the attacks on the World Trade Center, Bush followed through with his reading aloud to a grade school class in Florida. The ridiculousness of his actions is underscored by his inability to think under pressure.<br />Hill's book shows her solid understanding of the subject matter. She would have made a stronger case if she had concentrated on the Bush Administration alone and had referred to 1692 occasionally. The reader is left dissatisfied in the end and wonders, along with the author, about what will happen next. It is, however, a great read for history buffs and politically concerned citizens of the world.

It is a story of disappointment and reconciliation for a little girl placed in foster care and the dog who is unapproachable until she finds just the right place to touch him. Geared towards ages 6 through 12, Finding the Right Spot by Janice Levy teaches the reader to grasp the perspective of a child who cannot live with her parents.<br />Whatever the reason for the child's placement in a home outside his or her own, this book offers ways for the child to relate to the protagonist's emotions of anger, sadness, hope, and disappointment. It is equally appropriate for adults who work with children living without their parents.<br />\\"She's not coming,\\" the little girl says as she waits and waits for her alcoholic mother to arrive at her birthday party. The grave disappointment she experiences reinforces the reason she is not with her mother. In another section, her foster mother, Aunt Dane, allows her to pound the pizza dough until the house shakes. In the book, the little girl is allowed to show her anger and confusion.<br />Alcoholism, shelter living, and feelings of displacement are handled with great aptitude. The book touches at the heart of every person's emotions, big or small. Finding the Right Spot is a well-written book with exceptional illustrations that speak to all children. A helpful guide at the end, written by Jennifer Wilgocki, M.S. and Marcia Kahn Wright, Ph.D., breaks down the text into digestible parts for the adult reader. Finding the Right Spot is ideal for teaching school-age kids about all types of families, including non-traditional models.<br />I highly recommend this book for its approach to foster care living both for children and for the people who care for them.<br />Christine Louise Hohlbaum is an American author living near Munich.

The guidebook's narrative is interlaced with nostalgia, pointing out the great vitality of the Catskills in the 1950s and the current local proprietors' efforts to revive a somewhat ailing economy.<br />The Catskills Alive! is divided into chapters of the four counties spanning across the Catskills region. Silverman dedicates two entire sections to the numerous campgrounds and farm markets available there.<br />The Catskills Alive! is a great guide to have for an area whose advertising signs misrepresent what is still in business and what is not. Silverman has a rock-solid grasp on her subject matter as she sheds light on the history of grandiose hotels which have since been razed. In the case of the Leibowitz's Pine View Hotel, for example, the building has been turned into a correctional facility. These little facts make her book an easy and interesting read.<br />Even sports fans can find something of interest in Silverman's book. Each chapter offers useful information on sports facilities, golf courses, fitness studios, bird watching, and the like.

Reading a guide book is usually something one does before going to the destinations it describes. Francine Silverman's Long Island Alive! is not only an informative book for prospective Long Island visitors, but it is also an entertaining read for armchair travellers. Silverman writes in a narrative form that makes the reader feel a native Long Islander is showing her around the largest island ajacent to the Continental U.S.<br /><br />The book is divided into seven geographic headings: Nassau County's North and South Shores, Suffolk County's North and South Shores, Fire Island, and Suffolk County's North and South Forks. Farm markets are listed at the back of the book.<br /><br />From helpful, child-friendly tips to detailed historical descriptions of various landmarks, the author offers the reader useful and timely information. Each geographic section is divided into helpful subcategories for transportation, lodging, shopping, recreation and restaurants. Above and beyond the traditional guide book, Long Island Alive! has Web site suggestions for the curious reader to learn even more than its numerous pages entail. Silverman includes enough historical background to whet the reader's appetite, all the while making him or her want to learn more by visiting the places described.<br /><br />Long Island's size is not  its only impressive facet: the sheer number of fascinating historical places that Silverman depicts makes the reader want to pack her bags yesterday to experience Long Island first hand. Being a masterful writer, Silverman uses clear language to detail the most intriguing tidbits about the island. She inserts trivia in an appropriate manner between more somber entries such as the Holocaust Memorial of Nassau County. \\"The giraffe is the symbol of Great Neck - for obvious reasons\\" follows philanthropic opportunities at the Friends of the Arts which sponsors various music festivals and a children's workshop throughout the year.

Erica Miner's Travels with My Lovers delves the reader into a treasure trove of emotional highs and lows as her protagonist experiences a new side to herself.<br />The novella starts off in Florence, Italy in the 1970's. Travel's protagonist is travelling through Italy alone with her two small children. Her orchestra conductor husband, Eric, has chosen to spend the summer in New York City. Emotional tumult lies ahead as she discovers her husband's secret. Sensing a break-up in their future, she throws caution to the wind and allows herself to be pursued by a gorgeous Italiano, Carlo, in his mid-twenties. Just a few years older than he, the protagonist experiences intense sexual love that breaks open her heart and awakens her sexual being at once.<br />The novella is neatly organized into five easily digestible stories, each packed with a new discovery on her emotional horizon. The reader finds herself wishing each of the protagonist's five loves would be fulfilled in a happy-ever-after ending. But that is hardly the point of the book. Miner shows with great alacrity the protagonist's struggles to unearth her very self through these romantic escapades.<br />The author interweaves music, architecture, emotion and physicality in a beautiful blend of scenes and moments that cannot last. The bittersweet realization that one's longings can only be fulfilled through one's own sense of self, not through the Other, is handled with genuine grace.<br />Miner orchestrates the various romantic duets between American woman and foreign man (Italian, French, Swiss - take your pick!) with an unmatchable musicality. At moments, the reader believes to be in an opera by Puccini, witness to the indelible impact of Italian architecture and passion.<br />Erica Miner's book makes the reader long for warm summer nights along the Seine or the Riviera, arm in arm with a lover, gazing at life's beauty and the romance that can explode like a shooting star and then be gone in the wink of an eye.

Caldwell's Stages of a Woman is one of the best collection of short stories I have read in a very long time. Her stories touch the heart, the soul, and the mind. I found myself laughing along with Richelle's inner dialogue about her relationship with her boyfriend (will he marry me? won't he?) and crying at Momma Jowell's funeral as if she were my own Momma! Her uncanny ability to move the reader's emotions deserves world wide attention. Difficult issues such as child abuse in \\"There Was a Hole in My Bucket\\" or abortion in \\"Do You Know What I Did?\\" are handled with such grace, such beauty. As I read Caldwell's book, I was immediately reminded of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye and Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Ladies, move over! J.J. Caldwell has arrived!	2003-12-19

Mom Management helped me focus in a way that I have never been able to focus before. Tracy Lyn's book is well-written, clear, and chock full of wisdom. It served to encourage me to go for the things that I wanted to get to for a long time. For instance, I finally submitted a short story to a literary magazine that I had wanted to send for some time. Placing that task under her category for &quot;immediate goals,&quot; I went for it. It was accepted by the magazine editor within one hour!<br />Mom Management helps the reader actually recognize and then utilize the tools that she already possesses. It motivates the reader to eliminate wasteful activity, drives home the message of prioritizing and helps the reader, in a non-threatening manner, to work towards her dreams with great love and encouragement. Tracy is so real, so honest, and incredibly open in communicating her commitment to helping others. I highly recommend her book to everyone, mother or not, who is looking to hone their time management skills!	2003-11-30

Suspense novelist Larry Pontius provides his readers with a thrilling display of good versus evil with a complex cast of characters to match. His exceptional ability to develop his characters into believable figures makes the novel even better. Pontius makes the words fly across the pages of this lengthy book. I literally couldn't (amd much to my husband's dismay, wouldn't) put it down until the very end. I still have goosebumps from the last scene of the book. A fantastic read for all ages! I highly recommend Waking Walt.	2003-08-25
