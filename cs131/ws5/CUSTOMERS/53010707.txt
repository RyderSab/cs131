That's all due to Jacobs' impressive skills as a writer. He builds this story masterfully, weaving together facts, insights, philosophical ruminations and personal anecdotes so that the reader floats easily between the fascination of minutiae and the big-picture view of what it all means. (What is true knowledge? Who is really smart, and why? Which facts should we retain and which should remain ephemeral?  How can we best improve our minds?)     Another nice dichotomy is the contrast between pop culture and serious thought (although the frequent pop culture references will cause the book to date more quickly than it otherwise would.)    One criticism: I will agree with the reviewer who said this book needed a better editor. (I have no biggger pet peeve than the misuse of \\"it's\\" for \\"its.\\") The editor should definitely be issued one of the grammar citations created by Jacobs' eleven-year-old cousin.    All in all, this is a funny, warm, engaging book by an author you just know you'd love if you met him in person.	2004-12-20

He hasn't opened it yet, so I can't tell you what he thinks, but I'm very impressed with it. The story is entertaining and amusing, the illustrations are lovely, and even as a 33 year old adult, I had great fun trying to find all 76 dragons hidden in the artwork.  What's more, the production values of this book are outstanding. The heavyweight pages are embossed and spot-varnished, and the entire book feels hefty and substantial in your hand.  All in all, a great choice for a gift book.	2004-11-06

The editor displayed  refreshingly high standards when it came to picking which authors to include. The writing is of high quality, and the vast range of works included gives you an thorough, unvarnished look at all aspects of life and travel in Nepal. Taken together the entries accomplish the difficult task of helping the visitor-to--be know what it will FEEL like to be there.<br />You just don't get this kind of stuff out of guidebooks.<br />The book has enhanced my trip preparations and brought my excitement about going to Nepal to a fever pitch. I highly recommend this to anyone about to make a similar journey.<br />I hope to find more books in this series available for all the other countries on my travel wish list.	2004-03-12

Baxter's photographs capture what the country looks like, but more than that, they capture what it feels like. They're works of art.<br />Keep this one on your coffee table--you'll want to look at it often.	2004-03-08

For one thing, it reads more like an adventure or a novel than straight history. It's also much more philosophical than I would have expected. The book begins with the quote, &quot;The observer affects the observed,&quot; and boy is that statement ever borne out as the story unfolds.<br />Author Thomas Goltz sneaks into the country to cover the war, and ends up in a small town called Samashki, where he depends on the hospitality of a man named Hussein. Ostensibly there to record the fighting, Goltz soon becomes intimately involved, raising many tough questions about journalistic ethics and the effects of media war coverage.<br />The book really picks up steam in the second half, as Goltz returns to Chechnya to discover the damage his participation has caused, and tries to rectify it.  <br />It's a thought-provoking book that provides background on the Chechnyan war but also goes far beyond that to dwell on how our shallow media culture affects our understanding of world events (and beyond that, how media coverage actually determines the course of those events as they play out). Goltz is a likable narrator who doesn't shy away from implicating himself when it comes to the sticky moral questions. He brings to life real Chechnyans in such vivid fashion that you'll remember them every time you hear about Chechnya in the news.<br />I had tears in my eyes as I finished the book. Highly recommended.	2004-02-18

Many people who have lived or worked abroad try to write about their experiences, but few actually have the talent to create something worthwhile and lasting. Barbara Scot, however, has managed to capture some moments of incredible poignancy and beauty. A few passages even approach the level of poetry.<br />The book is a bit uneven in places, but nevertheless I consider it an excellent effort for a first-time author. You come away with a deep respect for both Nepal and her people, and for Barbara, who as an adventurous woman in her late 40s, will be a an inspiration for many. She's the kind of woman you'd like to know.<br />On another note--When I saw this book came from a feminist publishing house I was afraid I might be subjected to preachy diatribes about the evils patriarchy, but mercifully that was not the case. Scot does have a special concern for the women of Nepal, but she doesn't preach about it. In fact a sense of evenhandedness is one of the many virtues of the book. She poses many good questions without claiming to have the answers.	2004-01-15

This is the fascinating true story of how the Israeli security forces carefully plotted to track down, capture, and return Adolf Eichmann to Israel for trial. It reads like the very best spy fiction, but it's doubly engrossing because it all really happened. You come away with deep appreciation and admiration for the brilliant minds working in the Mossad, as well as with a sense of the banality of evil (Eichmann is a piteous figure). This isn't classic literature or anything, but it is extremely well done and utterly entertaining. Highly recommended!	2003-11-30

Getting to a place where you reduce your consumption of unnecessary stuff, commit your time, and leave your daily routine behind takes a fair amount of work, and it also takes a major shift in priorities. Vagabonding serves as the kick-start that gets you to that mental place --the &quot;I can do it, and I can do it soon&quot; reply to the siren call of world travel.<br />This book is inspiring, clear, and helpful. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to roam, but thinks they don't have enough money or time. I also recommend it for those, like me, who have gone vagabonding before, know what it takes, and just need a nudge of renewal in order to get back out there again. Great book!	2003-06-23

Paterson's prose is up to par with his images, which are absolutely gorgeous. Seeing Skye in all four seasons through Paterson's photographs helped me get a much better sense of this wonderful island (I've only visited once).

This time the reason I wish I knew the language is because I'd like to see if the original of  Heavy Sand has the same plainspoken, conversational tone which makes the English translation so engaging.  It doesn't take long to get [wrapped up] into the story of the Rakhlenko family and to fall in love with all the characters, from the noble to the scoundrels, with all shades of messy humanity in between.  At times you don't even feel as if you're reading a novel but hearing a good friend masterfully tell his story and those of his parents and grandparents. This is perhaps the most unpretentious great novel I've ever read.<br />The small events of the novel's first half blend seamlessly into the world events of the war and the destruction of the entire village, and in both times and places you feel utterly transfixed by what is happening to the people of this family and their village. And despite its depressing setting, Heavy Sand ends on a relatively uplifting note. There is plenty of horror in the book, but also plenty of hope. <br />I didn't want this book to be over. Highly recommended!	2002-11-05

I was pleasantly surpised, then, to find that Kelly Winters can really write. Walking Home was so engrossing that I couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting.<br />I'm not a hiker myself, just someone enthralled by the idea of undertaking a physical and mental challenge like the AT. I've read a lot of the Trail books and to me this is the best all-around entry. It has all the color and detail that makes you feel like you're there but it also places the quest in a bigger, more meaningful context. Highly recommended.	2002-09-23

I bought this book at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park gift shop. I thought it would be a mediocre look into the search and rescue efforts at the park. But it turned out to be surprisingly well-done! The stories were extremely gripping--I read the book in one quick sitting.  And I was disappointed when it was over. I only wish more stories had been included.<br />As the last event was dated 1989, I also wonder if techology (GIS, cell phones, etc.) has made park rescues any easier. It would have been nice to have had an afterword along those lines. But all in all this is a fantastic little book, a great unexpected find!	2002-09-11

Split between the uproarious devil-in-Moscow scenes and the novel- within-a-novel about Pilate, The Master and Margarita isn't like anything else you've ever read. It has a lot to say about the big themes of art, life and humanity but it's never pretentious and always highly readable. Truly unforgettable and highly recommended.	2002-09-07

Over a period of many years, he sat down with Brodsky and interviewed him about poetry, metaphysics and world events (with a little gossip thrown in for good measure). The result is a thorough and fascinating look at Brodsky's opinions at many different points in time. And the conversations are not just<br />one-sided: Volkov keeps up with Brodsky just fine, so it's like listening in on a tete-a-tete between two brilliant minds.  If you like Brodsky you will love this book.	2002-08-28

This is the best Sept. 11 book I've yet read, and it doesn't even come from America. The reporting is excellent and thorough and the level of detail is impressive. Sometimes gory, sometimes horrifying, but always educational, this book examines the events of that day from the point of view of the terrorists as well as the victims.

Gary (Igor) Shteyngart has managed to capture what it feels like to be caught between worlds, and he's done it in engrossing, enjoyable prose. His protagonist Vladimir is funny and sad and not at all pretentious--he stands as a foil to all those precious heartbreaking, staggering geniuses that seem to be multiplying like rabbits (no real offense to Dave Eggers, who's ok by me).  Shtenyngart nails &quot;types&quot; like there's no tomorrow--the one Slavophile in every crowd, skinny, pool-playing grad students, users of organic toothbrushes, members of the expat scene in Prague (recast as Prava here)--but there isn't any meanness to his skewering. He's just a damn good writer with a story to tell, making a lot of little observations that add up to something bigger. I checked this book out from the library but I'll be buying my own copy soon. Looking forward from more from this writer!	2002-07-05

(At the time I had a Ukrainian boyfriend struggling with his English, so I found Alex's mixed-up language both incredibly accurate and very close to home.) But I wasn't delighted merely because the writing is so clever. There is also something refreshingly innocent about Foer's writing, something that feels very pure, very new, and, well, BIG. I thought, &quot;Thank God...a real talent arrives!&quot;  And the book bears that out.  I look forward to the career of Jonathan Safran Foer...my new literary crush.	2002-06-13

I read this entertaining and suspenseful book in two hours because it's the very definition of a &quot;page-turner.&quot; The pace is fast and the story is great...that is, until the end, when twist after twist piles up into a truly improbable, dumbly cinematic, slapped-on ending. It almost felt as if Harlan Coben died before the book was completed and a third-rate substitute writer was brought in to author the ending. I was quite disappointed that Coben didn't work harder to wrap things up in a more believable and interesting way.<br />If this book had ended differently I would have given it maybe four and a half stars, because it's so incredibly engrossing at first.	2002-05-09

But I couldn't give it 5 stars because there are some moments where it wanders off and falls a little flat...almost as if the book just couldn't sustain its precocity throughout. Still, it's a worthwhile read, very impressive for a debut. I look forward to more from Ullmann.	2002-04-18

I had some idea, but sought confirmation, and Visson's book gave that, in a well-written, engrossing package. Wedded Strangers serves as a sober reminder that cross-cultural relationships have an extra level of difficulty, and that they shouldn't be entered into without preparation and understanding.<br />I have a few wishes/suggestions for any future editions of this book. <BR>--that experiences of more couples should be included.<BR>--that younger, post-Communist couples be explored in a different chapter<BR>--perhaps a postscript on love in the other former socialist republics<BR>--I would also like to hear about a few more of the successful unions. <br />Perhaps the reason Visson didn't do any of that in the 2000 edition is that there simply wasn't room. But when you are seeking understanding of the one you love, you can't get enough...and I was left craving more information at the end of the book. <br />That said, the current edition of the book remains extremely valuable--especially for those Americans who have had little or no exposure to Russian culture and are starting from scratch. Those men who go shopping for brides in the former Soviet Union should not be allowed to leave without reading this book first.	2002-01-15

He's right on  target with how it FEELS to be a birthparent: marginalized, feared,  misunderstood, and sometimes, even shamed. The book should be required  reading for all adoptive parents, so that they know that first parents are  regular people, pretty much just like them.<br />My favorite part of the book  comes at the end, with the simple list of ways adoptive parents can honor  and respect their child's birthparents. My least favorite part is the  description of grief; parts of that chapter didn't strike me quite right. I  think Gritter should have relied more on the words of those of us who have  actually gone through the grief. <br />But he did listen as he was writing the  book: I was fortunate enough to read this book in manuscript, and offered  my suggestions on how this book could be even more &quot;true to  life.&quot; Other birthparents did the same, making this, I think, an  essentially reliable guide to our feelings and desires.<br />In the end, the  message is simple: both sets of parents love and want what's best for the  child. And when both types of parents work together in a true open  adoption, beautiful things can happen.	2000-09-14

Not only is it beautiful on the outside, the  information it encourages you to set down on the inside is something that  the adoptee will surely adore. Even in an open adoption, it can be hard to  make yourself truly &quot;known&quot; to your child, but this book asks all  the right questions so that a complete portrait of the birthparent is  drawn.<br />Lots of space for pictures and personalization. Highly  recommended.	2000-09-14

This is the way literary biography  should be done. It's so good, in fact, that you wouldn't necessarily have  to be a huge Nabokov fan to want to read both books.

But I was drawn in for another reason: to  see how the male mind would react to his body being objectified, used, and  ultimately, thrown out.<br />This book is fascinating for those reasons. The  writing is, for the most part, well done, and the characters will stay in  your head for a long time.  I only give it four stars because the plot is a  little weak in places and some parts didn't seem totally thought through.  But this is a gripping, entertaining book, and very, very unsettling.	2000-08-31

In Emma  Bovary, Flaubert has created a complex, infuriating woman who is  incredibly, utterly real. The reader learns so much about human nature--not  only through Emma's illusions and despair, but through the peculiar quirks  of all the other supporting characters. A masterpiece.	2000-08-31

(Coercion in adoption remains widespread.)<br />All would-be adoptive parents need to read this book to fully understand the grief of their children's  birthparents.

Even more than that, they are inflammatory. I cannot imagine how her son will feel if and when he ever reads this book. If she loves her son, she  needs to respect his birthmother, simple as that.<br />Wolf's idea of writing  the &quot;secret thoughts&quot; is not a bad one, but some of the thoughts  should have stayed secret. Some of them are too ugly to see print.	1999-05-20

But this book doesn't really work as a collection, or as anything but a mere surface-level look at faith.<br />I share her beliefs  and her style of humor-filled, laid-back Christianity, but after a while I  got tired of her whining. Lamott should have been much more ruthless in  editing a book about God and faith. And she should have tried to delve  deeper than she did.<br />But...still worth reading.	1999-05-05

I've read most every book on adoption in print, and this is one of the best.  My one criticism is that I think she tends to  underplay the trauma inherent in giving up a child.

I wouldn't recommend it as the first book prospective adoptive  parents read on the topic, because the extreme openness of the Howells' adoption might make them think they had to achieve such closeness right away, but I do recommend it be read.
