I am sad becouse I want to know what happens to the family in the future. I am happy it's over becouse by then end I was tired of reading the books they started to drag on. In the final book Carter Kent sets out across america in search of himself and riche's and gets in some bad sistuations.. Will Kent becomes a doctor. Eleanor Kent marries a Jewish actor. They end up in the middle of the Johnstown flood and it changes there lives forever. The book draged on I found the charactors to be boring in this on and I ahd no interest in them. I liekd the Johnston flood and Eleanor's charactor the best. Overall it was ok it wasent the worse of the series and it had good parts I just found it draged on.	2005-09-30
US	18379070	RH0WZ3ODIJIJD	0451214528	806377531	The Lawless (The Kent Family Chronicles)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	One of the best of the series action, murder, and romance	I have to say this is one of the best of the series so far. The book has lots of action and romance. It's a faced pase book not like the last few books which have been slow. The story starts out with Matthew Kent, son of Jephtha Kent, is in Paris, pursuing the life of an artists. He is forced to leave the country after some incodents( I will not say you ahve to read). Then there is Dolly the women Jephta loves becomes pregnant and insists that they marry to avoid the stigma of bastardy for their child.There maragie dosent survivve do to many incodents. Gideon has an affair with his dead cousion's wife. Gideon's daughter Eleanor raped then she joines an acting group. This book is great and the second to last book. Now on to the last of the series.	2005-09-21

The book is like to parts the first half of the book was really good with Jeremiah Kent following his promise to his dying commander,Captain Rose who is worried about the fates of his wife and daughter when the Union Army seizes his plantation he changes his name and joins forces with an Indian after an event at the plantation that changes his life forever. That part of the book was good after that the book gose doiwn hill Jeremiah becomes an outlaw. Then we see Michael Boyle where he meets Hannah, the daughter of a whisky selling pedlar. They marry,move to her home state and proceed to build a successful business. I find his story pointless and long. We alsos ee other family memebers of the Kents as they strugle to re-build the nation. I liked how they show a nation after the war you feel for the charactors. Overall it was a good book but still not the best.	2005-09-07

I found the last book in the series was a hugh dissapointment in the series butt his one was just liek the rest full of action romance and adventure. I would not say it's the best of the series but it's still entertaining from start to finish. We see the hatred of the North and South. We see a nation crumble, we see romance on it's highs and lows of the war. One of the best emotional book of the series we see how the people delt with the war. Cant wait to read the other ones.	2005-09-02

I found the 3rd book to be the best so far so ic ould not wait to read the Furies and waht a dissapoinment. The book is so boring and it drags on and on. It's not like the other book's with the war's and the great stories this book is boring. I found the charactors really boring and have no life in this book. I hope the next one is good.	2005-08-25

Then the third vol in the Kent family is The Seekers and it's the best one yet. Finally the stories unfold and the charactors finally develope. Abraham Kent marries is hald sister and moves to the west. I really liked the store of Abraham in the west with there encounter witht he Indians and the strugles. You see the down fall of many characters you fell in love with in the first two books. In the middle things change and new stories begen to unfold which I liked. Then the book ends with a kinda of cliffhanger which makes you cant wait to read the next books. The best in the series so far and I cant wait to read the rest.	2005-08-15

I found it not as good as the first but still it's a good novel. The thing I did not like abput the novel was the war parts some people will like it but I found they draggged on. I like how they shoed the coldness of the winters to the fighters and the harsh reality of war but the battel scences were long. Then there is new character like  drunkard from the Virginian plantation families Judson Fletcher. Then there is Philips wife I was sad to see her outcome in the novel but enjoyed that part of the book. Very good characters in this book and I cant wait to read the next.	2005-08-12

Philip Kent is the main character he flees England with his mother to get away from his Brother who wants them dead. When Philip arrives in America he meets a beatiful women adn gets involved in the Boston Tea Party. On the journey through out the book he come along maney historic figures.

I foud the book to be split the first half was pretty good and then the second half very bad and boring. The book is very depressing there is no happienes in it which botherd me. The book was to depressing for me. The characters where pretty good but it's anchent China and back then the women and no rights so it's very hard on the women. I found it true to facts about the men ruling and the women slave's and do what the men want but the book is to much and again deppressing. The first half was not boring it was intersting getting to know the characters then it changes and it's so boring the second half. The characters change and again it's boring. I liked in the book after his wife steals the jewels the good luck turns and they become rich but his wifes fortune turns bad. The main characters has an affair and dosnet care about his wife which i ddi not like. overall to Depressing for me but some my like it.	2005-07-22

The thing I liked about this book is it gets right to the point and dosent drag on like Goblet of fire and some parts of the last book. The story is great and is like Chamber of secrets. The book is not dark like the last two. The villians are great in the book espesially the second chapter what a shock it was reading that one of the teachers is bad and we thought was good the whole time. Also finally we see Draco turn evil (but I wont say if he turns bad you'll have to read it your self). The big shock was the death of a main character, like the last book in which Seriuos Black died another character bites the dust. When the character dies it's very sad and you think why and you think the next book wont be the same with out the character. I loved how all the characters are going through the crush stages if there live. Harry has fellings for Ginny, Ron and Harminy do but they dont really edmite but the readers know. The ending was very good and it makes you wanting more I cant wait till the next book. I can see the next book being very diffrent from all the rest. Overall the best Potter yet.	2005-07-19
