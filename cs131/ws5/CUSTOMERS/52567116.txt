Good for young readers more as a history of philosophy and an intro to 18th century thought.  Would rate much higher if there was an editor.  Rampant misspellings and content errors.  Ex. The main Greek god was not Jupiter, Tristram Shandy is not a figure from Arthurian legend.  So much for discipline . . . .<br />  Paragraphs are full of exclamation points, all caps, and underlining for emphasis, which is terribly amateurish.  The illustrations are so crude, that it would be better if they were left out.  Prose goes like this:  \\"Only fourteen will end up in the Corps of Engineers.  Fourteen!  That's a telling statistic!\\"<br />  That said, it's still very interesting and full of fascinating anecdotes.  It can be great with some cleaning up.	2003-01-19

Chuck: Maybe &quot;Me and the boys are playing all night&quot; means that the band Kiss are playing music.<br />      He mentions that some of this book was written while sitting on the toilet bowl; unfortunately, it shows.<br />      Tho I admire his honesty saying he only owned 4 albums in college, it painfully adds to my conclusion that he is hardly an authority on the subject and that there are lots of gaps in his knowledge.  He actually admits that he had never heard any Tricky before, while dissing stupid critics who praise him.  But if he never heard any Tricky, then he never heard any of Massive Attack, arguably creators of the best cd of the 90's.<br />      Here is a clue: 11 pages talk about Debbie Gibson, but there is only one mention of the Marshall Tucker Band, 3 mentions of Creedence.  So if he can flip off comments about brain-dead hippies, what the hell does he think he is?<br />   Totally tasteless is the way he raps about his own ideations about suicide while knocking Kurt Cobain.   Unbelieveable.<br />   Positive side:  Not many people are going to know who the Louvin Brothers or Andrea True are.  This book is really packed with trivia, so rocknroll fanatics should really enjoy the memoribilia.  And chapters about players who are missing various appendages are fascinating for anyone interested in this arcana.	2000-09-23

Flaws: 1) No exegesis on why the guy is so homicidal; 2) Children of abuse issues that are simply abandoned; 3) Even romantic sex is kind of a brutal thing; 4) No maniac in his right mind  would walk into such an obvious trap.<br />  Flashes of brilliance       check  this out:  &quot;until the little kid who'd been beaten by his father loved  her, and the adolescent who'd been rejected by his younger sister loved  her, and the man who'd gone off to fight wars because he no longer cared if  he lived or died loved her.

Part 2 (of 3) could have been left out; one nut at a time, ok??      Don't judge a book  by its dreary cover, *Headhunter* is a fantastic thriller, if you can stand  ultimate hard core sicko-sexual.

Usually, I'd walk on by a book about small town Georgia cops, never imagining it could be this enthralling.     The author is masterful at drawing the  reader into this little world; I found myself talking out loud to the  characters.  He doesn't rely on the graphic gore and language of the  typical modern shock thriller, hence making the terror more real.    What  makes the southern authors so good!?  This belongs with &quot;Gone With the  Wind&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Tides.&quot;  As a serial killer story,  it belongs with the best of Lawrence Sanders.	1999-08-24

In the not too distant future can we build a computer that can develop its own identity? consciousness?     This is a rare story.  The plot is let's teach it to pass an English test.  Between the lines is the question: What  is the meaning and purpose of being?     Not easy reading, requires a  dictionary on hand.  Sentences like: &quot;Recursive by nature, mentation  wasn't going to yield to measurement alone.&quot;  But at least it doesn't  have those 3-page paragraphs and 50-word sentences....   Adjust to the  scholarliness, and one will find lots of wit and interesting relationships.  Credible throughout.  No bad guys, no winners, no losers. It was so good I  didn't want to finish.     The theme: Maybe would should appreciate our  human existence a little more than we do.  So simple, yet so profound.	1998-12-09

I'm NY Irish myself, but was  frustrated by the paucity of culturalisms I could relate to.   Notice not  many reviews for this book?

This is your  standard fare vampire-type serial killer with a little &quot;Jekyll and  Hyde&quot; thrown in.  Apologies to Anne Rice, but hasn't this genre been  about pounded to death?  (Maybe not: people keep buying carbon copy serial  killer novels.)   Now get this: one's a vampire but the others are kind of  ok because there were TWO formulas!  (Give me a break!)

Fascinating and involving novel of a mother's return to normalcy via rebuilding her family.  Characters are so real you can touch them and fall in love with them.  After a fantastic first half, the momentum fizzles and becomes a cross between Good Housekeeping and Tom Sawyer.  &quot;Lost in a cave adventure&quot; is out of place here.  But after that the plot tightens agains and the result is a great but curiously flawed novel by a brilliant author who needs a sterner editor.	1998-07-31
