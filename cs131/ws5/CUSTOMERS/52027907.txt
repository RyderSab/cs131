Story is told in a first person P.I. style which means there's some wry humor as well as a focus totally from the main character's POV.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />(1) Fast read;<br /><br />(2) Vampires are similar to the legends but have enough unique differences where we are dealing with something new and enticing;<br /><br />(3) Anita is a nice mix of male and female which means she should appeal to both genders;<br /><br />(4) Well plotted; hardly any gap holes of logic; pacing is well done; and<br /><br />(5) Big finale climax at the end. Satisfying if you like things settled, well, violently. Heh.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />(1) Her early books are great.  I would warn that by book ten she starts to spend too much time in the lovemaking which slows everything down.  Not an issue in this novel but will be later if you fall for the series as I did.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; SETTING/TONE: B plus to A minus; WHEN READ: 2006 (revised review mid April 2012); OVERALL GRADE: B plus.	2005-09-12

Currently reading the second book and no loss of steam power from the author.  What I don't get is why more people haven't discovered this book.  DOH!  Must be that Tor didn't market it as hard compared to more mediocre fantasy novels. <br /> <br />The best way to view the story is to imagine a lot of petty kingdoms with dukes as vassals to these kings.  The first book focuses on several of the dukes of one kingdom as well as other characters who come into and out of the tale.  There's also a race of albino type beings who have short life spans, practice magic and lost big time against the humans in a war from long ago. <br /> <br />I would say the character complexities are close to that of George R.R. Martin's fantasy series.  Coe spends a lot of time developing such characters, and, like Martin, he's big on believable History of the realm. <br /> <br />PROS <br /> <br />(1) At heart this is a murder mystery and conspiracy tale, so, if you like such things, this is good. <br /> <br />(2) Complex characters; <br /> <br />(3) No long typical fantasy tale journeys where it gives the characters and excuse to bore us with the rules of magic or a long, boring tale of Historical stuff that could have been spread out in the novel.; <br /> <br />(4) He doesn't follow the typical fantasy archetype adventure which is refreshing.; <br /> <br />(5) Lots of interesting Historical detail which feels different and not a rehash of previous fantasy books; and <br /> <br />(6) Magic is low and not like some bad RPGing game. <br /> <br /> <br />CONS <br /> <br />(1) There are a ton of names and places to keep track of, but, if you hold out, it's worth it b/c it makes the story more complex than the simple tales.  If you prefer the simple ones, and, that doesn't mean you're stupid by the way, then HARRY POTTER or ERAGON should do nicely.  It's too bad the book doesn't have an appendix of names and places but this is probably more a decision of the publisher than the author.; <br /> <br />(2) If you want to spend all your time with only one main character, then, this is surely not the book for you.; and <br /> <br />(3) Not a ton of battles, although there are a few, so, if you need a lot, this isn't it.  Think intrigue more than hack and slash/break the door down/charge style.	2005-09-12

Most of them focus on the supernatural and there's a whole underbelly of mythical creatures which mortals are mostly unaware of . .. vampires, werewolves, enemy wizards, faeries, ghosts, etc. <br /> <br />STRENGTHS <br /> <br />(1) Innovating idea which hasn't been pursued in quite some time; <br /> <br />(2) Typical wise cracking P.I. type with some funny lines; <br /> <br />(3) Follows a lot of plot/story elements of the typical investigation; <br /> <br />(4) Oh so kewl explanation of how magic works which are typically detailed in most fantasy tales; <br /> <br />(5) Great climatic endings; <br /> <br />(6) A funny talking skull named Bob; <br /> <br />(7) Teaches you how to defeat a demon that's banging on your door; and <br /> <br />(8) Shows you how to be one of the good guys. <br /> <br />NOT SO GOOD <br /> <br />(1) A few cliches at time but nothing to make you want to throw the book against the wall, like other fantasy tales; <br /> <br />(2) subplot love story felt sophmoric; and <br /> <br />(3) Wizard's rants about how he wishes to treat women sometimes feels, well, not so believable. <br /> <br />That said, it's still easily in the top three for the year and refreshingly different, so, HOORAY!!!!	2005-07-06

Men die, they said, but reputation does not die.\\"<br /><br />That produced silence, except for the mutter of the interpreter talking to Ivar. Then Ubba awoke, looked startled for a few heartbeats as if he was not sure where he was, then he stared at me and I felt my flesh shrivel for I had never seen a face so malevolent. He had dark eyes and they were full of hate and I wanted the earth to swallow me.<br /><br />He stared balefully across the encampment where men were drinking. \\"Do you know who wins battles, boy?\\"<br />\\"We do, Father.\\"<br />\\"The side that is least drunk,\\" he said, and then, after a pause, \\"but it helps to be drunk.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Because a shield wall is an awful place.\\"<br /><br />You can hear a shield wall being made. The best shields are made of lime, or else of willow, and the wood knocks together as men overlap the shields. Left side of the shield in front of your neighbor's right side, that way the enemy, most of whom are right-handed, must try to thrust through two layers of wood.<br /><br />I lunged Wasp-Sting forward, and the Dane ran onto her point. I felt the impact run up my arm as her tip punctured his belly muscles, and I was already twisting her, ripping her up and free, sawing through leather, skin, muscle, and guts, and his blood was warm on my cold hand, and he screamed, ale breath in my face, and I punched him down with the shield's heavy boss, stamped on his groin, killed him with Wasp-Sting's tip in his throat.<br /><br />Beware the man who loves battle. Ravn had told me that only one man in three or perhaps one man in four is a real warrior and the rest are reluctant fighters, but I was to learn that only one man in twenty is a lover of battle. Such men were the most dangerous, the most skillful, the ones who reaped the souls, and the ones to fear.

I did, however, give this four stars as I felt this was a 3.5 book, like his last one, and, the time before, I gave him a 3 star rating.     This isn't a five star novel.  George R.R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a five star novel.    That said, it isn't fair to compare anyone to GRRM as he's top of the line and has been writing for over 30 years (i.e. varied in Hollywood and novel genres of sci fi, horror and now fantasy).    In comparison, Keyes has done some spinoff writing for companies but this series is the first of his own.  For all purposes, he's a new writer who's making respectable progress.    Overall, I feel this is a solid book.  Good but not great, but, certainly way above most of the fantasy novels being published.    Okay, now that we put it on the barometer, time to actually discuss the story.    CHARNEL PRINCE (CP) follows shortly after the first novel.  In this tale we have three basic story lines:    (1) Anne Dare's group as she tries to return home and avoid capture (i.e. this includes Neil, the guardian of the queen, trying to track Anne down as well);    (2) Aspar and previous company trying to track down the Briar King, per orders of the Church, and destroy it with the equivalent of an arrow of slaying (i.e. note that these items existed mythologically before the D&D game); and    (3) Focus back on the kingdom with viewpoints mostly on the Queen, who has few allies, and, the composer, who stumbles into court intrigue.    The composer, by far, is the most interesting as there is a focus on music and a national anthem equivalent, which has rarely been done in fantasy works.    In the first novel, I felt that it broke down like this:    GOOD POINTS    (1) Lots of time spent on a believable History;  (2) good cast of character;  (3) it moves;  (4) author is good at creating emotional affects; especially fear and curiousity    BAD POINTS    (1) dialogue needs work. While it doesn't suck it lacks complexity and nuances that we expect in dialogue;  (2) Some of the characters, like the dialogue, needs development. Lots of archetypes for those who like it;  (3) a few plot holes.    In the new novel, I would say that the good points still exist and the dialogue is no longer a problem as much.  There are still a lot of archetypes used, as well as a few minor plotholes.    BTW, Keyes based many of the kingdom names on the Historical Roanoke colony (i.e. the English colonists who strangely disappeared).    Overall, a good fantasy book but not a great or superlative one.  But, once again, better than most fantasy works, so, worth the read.	2004-11-14

In the second novel, we follow Henry II who was but a boy as his mother, Maude, fought for the throne.  In the end, Maude and her opponent tired each other out for almost twenty years, agreeing to leave the throne to her son.  Henry's rise looked promising as he had a distinguished battle record and married the beautiful and clever Eleanor of Aquitaine, making him the wealthiest man in Europe.<br />But, Henry's future rule proved to not be so lacking in turbulence.  One of his first challenges dealt in trying to conquer Wales which only resulted in many dead and lost time.  <br />Things proved better on the mainland where unruly French vassals tried to break away.  True to his past, Henry spent a great deal of time in the saddle brusing his unruly vassals.<br />During this time, Eleanor was having child after child, yet beginning to resent Henry b/c he was ignoring her advice and spending less and less time with her.<br />Overall, the main challenge to Henry was the Thomas Beckett affair, which resulted in a showdown between the Church and Henry's rule.  As many History buffs know, Henry prevailed at first but suffered later when Beckett was slain by vassals to Henry.  A good part of this novel covers the actual Historical meetings, conversations and friendship erosion of Henry and Beckett.<br />I would put this below WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT, as well as SUNNE IN THE SPLENDOUR.  It is definitely better than the mystery trilogy she did on the side for fun, but most likely a notch below the Welsh trilogy.	2004-01-16

Books	5	12	14	N	N	IT'S ALL IN THE MIND, SO TRUE	Of all the RICH DAD books this is my most favorite.  Why? Simply because we've got someone who can walk the talk, telling us that most of the resistance we experience in making money is our own limitations.    It didn't make sense when I was working a day job. Sounded like a bunch of huey, really, but, once I started down the entrepreneurial path, that all changed.    I'm in total agreement. Most of the limitations Americans experience with wealth is all in their heads.    That said, for those willing to take a deep look in themselves and who are willing to grow, this is one of the best books on the matter.    Highlights included:    (1) The most expensive advice is free advice b/c the wrong advice can destroy you.  How many times do we take advice from next door neighbors about stocks when they know nothing, or, almost nothing?  What does this have to do with mental limitations.  Plenty.  The people we associate with or want to believe can hold us back if their advice isn't accurate.  I wouldn't take advice from journalists on TV, who make less than 100k yet give advice on the stock market daily, would you?  Well, lots of people do listen to them.;    (2) The power of expanding one's reality.  How many things do we feel are not true yet are?  Wasn't their a time when we believed man could not fly and now we can fly?;    (3) Why do most of us not have a financial plan?  Why do we rely on the govt to take care of us?  Why do we choose to not have a long term plan?;    (4) Why the language we use restricts us even if we choose to believe it.  If we say CANNOT or SOMEDAY how does that make us feel?  How does it not serve us?;    (5) Setbacks and how they help us.  Most people give up when they're really close.;    (6) How to create a winning team to assist you;    (7) The velocity of money application; and    (8) all types of leverage to achieve our financial goals.    Highly advised reading.    NOTE: I think RK sometimes makes things sound easy.  While some of the concepts are simple, nothing is easy.  I did pre-foreclosures for a couple of years and that was tough work.  I made enough money to sit back and reflect and now I'm doing something I want to do: write a novel.  I don't plan to return to real estate but I do appreciate the many financial lessons. 12/20/05.	2004-01-16

Is that what Rules women want?;<br />#2: If you're always ending calls first, no matter how well the conversation is going, aren't most guys beyond high school going to figure out what you're doing?

One of the authors couldn't hold her man and got a divorce.  Whether it's one fault or both, seems to me that the author isn't clear on what works and does not work.  Likewise, I don't listen to journalists, who make less than 60k, yet give advice on the stock market to make money.  Why would I get advice from people who produce far less results than I do?  So, I ask why are you getting advice from someone whose own relationship does not produce the listed results?; and<br />#4: There isn't enough here about tapping a man's ego.  If more women did that, instead of hanging up on guys or not returning calls, they might get more results.<br />Some of the points, like not being super available or talking about yourself only, are valid points.

This takes place in the early 12th century when Henry I, who had over 20 illegitimate children, loses his one legitimate heir in the White Ship Ordeal (i.e. basically, a chunk of the fleet sank in the British storms).  Upon Henry I's death it was settled that Henry's daughter, Maude, would rule. For his barons this was quite unpopular as women were not supposed to rule, which opened the doors for a cousin, Stephen of Blois, to usurp the crown.<br /><br />What followed was an 18 year struggle in which both sides controlled the throne.<br /><br />The interesting aspect of this tale was that both potential rulers had serious flaws which blocked them from truly ruling. Stephen was kind and gentle yet his kindness was sometimes taken as a weakness by his barons.  Additionally, his stubbornness at the Battle of Lincoln (i.e. when his vassals urged him to retreat) almost cost him his life and resulted in his capture.  But then, Maude underestimated Stephen's wife, as well as the Londoners, who tossed her out and put her in a precarious position.  She then escaped but soon found herself forced to leave her army behind which endangered her illegitimate brother, Robert, and resulted in his capture.<br /><br />Thus, Robert was exchanged for Stephen and the war continued after a truce.<br /><br />Eventual fighting led to Maude's army being confined at Oxford.  Matters got so bad for her during this siege that she and three others wore white cloaks and snuck past Stephen's army during a snowstorm.  Stephen, who eventually captured the castle, was flustered (i.e. during the first battle from long ago he had allowed Maude to leave the castle in an act of gallantry.  His barons blamed him for this much later and, even when he tried to capture her, she always managed to slip away).<br /><br />Victories came and went for both sides, and vassals continued to switch sides.  Maude lost her main supporter, Robert, who died in the later years of this struggle.  Because of this, Maude's vassals could no longer be held together and she was forced to flee across the waters to Normandy (i.e. northern France).<br /><br />Note that during this war Maude's husband, Geoffrey, Duke of Anjou, had managed to seize many of the British territories, giving Normandy to Maude.<br /><br />But kingship for Stephen left a bitter aftertaste.  His wife, Mathilda, died and Stephen continued to have problems with the Church and unruly vassals.  Meanwhile, Maude's son, Henry, was securing Normandy and ended up marrying Eleanor of Aquitaine, which only made more powerful by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />In the end, and, in less than two years, Henry landed in England, where he was supported by his own troops as well as British lords.  Stephen put up resistance, but the tides of war were against him.  Bad omens and war weary vassals eventually convinced him to pass his title to Henry upon his death.<br /><br />And, in the end, Henry II took the throne of England with very little bloodshed.<br /><br />Penman's writing strengths are in her vivid descriptions, her real and varied characters, her build up of conflict and conclusions and, of course, let us not forget that her love stories are pretty good, too.<br /><br />Overall, this is sterling silver quality, so read it right away.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus to A;<br />HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY: A; OVERALL GRADE: A minus; WHEN READ: 2003 (3rd reading in 2011).	2003-07-18

A little trivia: she actually hand wrote a good deal of this novel, lost it and then started all over again. That's commitment! SUNNE traces the life of Richard III, breaking it into three sections of this 800+ page novel:<br /><br />PART ONE sheds light on that confusing Historical time known as the Wars of the Roses. For those who never truly understood it, you will. The War was basically one of cousins who were all descended from an ancestor king. Add a weak king to the pot and we have a civil war. Anyway, during that period, we get to see a very young Richard and the many relatives he lost to the early Wars of the Roses. Major players such as Richard's older brother, Ned (i.e. future Edward IV), are revealed as are the monk-like, insane King Harry (Henry VI), as well as his wife, Margerite Anjou . . and let us not forget Richard Neville, the Kingmaker, who at one point during his life, held two different English kings captive. During this section, Ned eventually prevails for the Yorks and becomes King Edward IV. Immediately, he has a clash of wills with his cousin, Richard Neville, and this sets up the scenario for . . .<br /><br />PART TWO: where Edward IV takes the throne and immediately unsettles everyone by marrying into the Woodville family, taking Elizabeth as his queen. Unfortunately for everyone, the Queen has a poor personality compared to her ravishing beauty, which creates a number of conflicts. Richard, who is heaped with honors, is not comfortable in court nor are the Neville Family, as well as many other allies. Edward IV keeps them all from killing each other and also puts up with more Lancastrian attempts to seize the throne, as well as an eventual civil war with his Neville cousins, and his very antagonist brother, George, Duke of Clarence. George also makes life hell for Richard's love interest, Ann Neville, but, in the end, Ann and Richard are married. Continuing friction grows on all sides as Ann sees that Richard is overlooking the flaws of his brother, Edward IV.<br /><br />PART THREE: follows us as Edward IV's reign spirals downward. His ailing health and his methods to contain a very sensitive secret force him to not only slay mad King Harry but his brother, George, as well. Of course, other reasons are used but that's another story. In the end though, Edward IV's lifestyle catches up with him, leaving his kingdom in an upheaval. Richard III is appointed as the protectorate of the realm until Edward's son comes of age, but, in truth, the Queen and her people do not trust him. Civil war is averted when Richard captures the heir to the throne but even then, things are going badly. Richard loses his one blood son and his allies begin to turn on him. Worse, someone else murders the children in the tower (i.e. this is one of Penman's interesting points where she claims Richard III is not the villain portrayed by Shakespeare) and blames Richard. In the end, Richard loses his wife, feels he is cursed and takes a number of risky measures when a distant Lancastrian pretender to the throne (i.e. future Tudor dynasty) challenges him on the battlefield. Through betrayal and circumstances, Richard III is slain and the Plantaganet line dies out with him.<br /><br />After re-reading many of Penman's novels I have to say that this is still my favorite. Unusual that a first book is written well enough to be comparable or better than later books but there you have it. Penman's writing strengths are in her vivid descriptions, her real and varied characters, her build up of conflict and conclusions and, of course, let us not forget that her love stories are pretty good, too.<br /><br />Overall, this is sterling silver quality, so read it right away. Fans of George Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE should know a good chunk of this historical period influenced him greatly.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A; HISTORICAL ACCURACY: A minus to A; ACTION & WAR SCENES: A minus; WHEN READ: 2003 (third reading) (revised review in March 2012); OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.	2003-07-14

Well, I'm delighted to say that it still has all its magic.  <br />As an aspiring writer, I was breaking down the story, trying to figure out what made it special.  It's not so much the setting as there are many fairy tale legends which are similar to this one . .. nor is it the actual idea as many good princes have been unjustly imprisoned and then tried to redeem themselves later.<br />This tale's strength is in its narrative prose as well as its nuances.  The magical dollhouse, the napkins, the tidbits of legends, the extra push for detailing characters all explain why King is such a great storyteller.<br />If you like King, read this.

But his agent told him to build up his base of fans by writing several more thrillers. His EYE OF THE NEEDLE pushed him up to the best seller list.<br /><br />At a later point, after writing those novels and studying medieval cathedral architecture, Follet got to write his 900 page novel centering around the British dispute of the crown between Queen Maude and King Stephen; these were the contestants who preceded Henry II, who is best known for his colorful History with Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard the Lion Hearted and the gray King John.<br /><br />Story centers around several commoner types, with a few exceptions, whose lives intertwine in the eventual struggle to build a glorious cathedral. Without revealing too much and generalizing this story has: lurid scenes of lust, violence, intrigue, political disputes, wars, loves gained, loves lost, main characters dying, a child abandoned at birth and much more. And, to enthusiasts of History, it even teaches readers of the period.<br /><br />Highly advised reading, even if the dialogue is a bit informal and the structure sometimes isn't as focused as it could be.

It is written in a manner where most readers can relate to the powers on both sides . .. difficult to do especially in the second and third book, when Longshanks or Edward I, comes into the spotlight.<br />Wales is losing ground and, for the first time, England has a powerful ruler who can take advantage of it.  And, he does.<br />And, as the rulers of Wales plot against each other, Edward grows stronger.  He even marries off one of his cousins, hoping to make the strongest Welsh prince, come to his way of thinking but it does little good.<br />This is where the third book starts . . . and where it ends.<br />REVISION NOTE AS OF 09/05/03: I have re-read THE RECKONING so my memory if far more clear.  The beginning of this novel is truly a conclusion to the Montfort Family from the second book.  As some will recall, this is the family that lost to the English King and had to retreat to France.  It is there that old wounds are gradually healed, the Montforts continue upward, or downard, in their lives and the family is connected back to England through a broken plight troth: prince Lwellyn of Wales to Eleanor de Montfort.<br />But unlike his grandfather, Lwellyn Fawhr, Lwellyn ap Gruffyd has more brothers, who are out to fight and betray him; a stronger English King who has the drive and strategy to absorb Wales into the Kingdom, and a number of incidents, resulting in bad fortune.  In addition, Lwellyn's bride is captured by Edward I and held for three years before she is finally freed.  By the time she is freed, Edward has forced Lwellyn to give up territories and privileges.<br />So, by the time Lwellyn goes to war against Edward, a portion of Wales has already been partitioned off.  In addition, a fatal wound and no heir, leaves Wales in turmoil, leaving Edward I the advantage of taking over the country.<br />Note that Edward I was also Longshanks, who was the English King in BRAVEHEART.  A fine movie but not entirely accurate in the Historical sense, since the French princess was 7, Edward I had many more children, there was no bridge shown at the Battle of Stirling and people tended to wear helmets to protect themselves in such bloody fights.  Lastly and obviously, there was no bastard son born from Wallace and the princess.  Nice dramatic punch though.	2002-05-11

In cases where the drama was heavy, the facts are off (i.e. look at BRAVEHEART; great film but missing some Historical points, like the fact that the princess was about 7 or 8 at the time).  Anyway, I know my standards are high but that's the way it is and that's why I'm very glad I've found Penman.<br />This tale centers around the power struggle between Earl Simon de Montfort, a true Historical figure, and King Henry III.  As the latter continues to show his incompetence, Simon realizes he must fight against the tyranny of the British king.  To make this even harder is the fact that the earl's sons have grown up with the sons of Henry III, which includes soon to be Edward I (Longshanks) . . . and, Simon is married to Henry's sister.<br />But, what makes this story above and beyond most Historical fiction is it's heart.  The characters truly come alive and burn through the page setting the readers' soul on fire as we fall deeper and deeper into the story.  In other words, it breathes passion and most of us read to get those experiences which we fail to get in real life.  Enough said.<br />REVISION NOTE: I have just finished a second reading of this stellar novel and need to add a few points:<br />(1)Penman writes excellent subplot love stories;<br />(2) The relationship between Simon and his wife is well charged, lively and passionate; and<br />(3) There is a whole set of chapters about Wales, which deals with Lwellyn ap Gruffyd's conflicting loyalties to his father and grandfather.  A lot of this is setup for the next story in THE RECKONING (edited as of 09/05/03)	2002-05-06

But then, a few different people recommended Penman, I tried her out and she's now on my list of authors worthy of reading!<br />Here are some good reasons to read Penman:<br />(1) EVOCATIVE IMAGERY: the words flow with apparent ease, opening the reader's mind to a new world; you can see this mentioned in some of the more popular reviews below;<br />(2) VIBRANT, INTERESTING CHARACTERS: while Penman may have added some components to some of the Historical figures, she did keep the known personality elements of each character.  This seems especially so of King John;<br />(3) FLOW:  unlike some Historical novels, the author doesn't try to push too many facts on you at the expense of the story pacing;<br />(4) HIGHLIGHTS THE BIG CONFLICTS OF HISTORY: some authors gloss over the big moments b/c they're trying to get everything into the Historical novels.  Penman doesn't necessarily feel obligated to do this and puts more emphasis towards the structure<BR>and flow of the story.  For instance, it isn't unusual for her to cover a year in one chapter and then start three years later.;<BR>and<br />(5) INTEREST: obviously, you want to know about this period; all the intrigues; the Plantanganet line; the royal Welsh line; how people lived and thought back then; the importance of honor today, etc.	2002-04-02

Not only was it a best seller but it also was adapted into a movie, starring Donald Sutherland.<br />Here are some reasons to read THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE:<br />(1) PRECISION: you like reading about cool, precise heroes or anti-heroes or villains who are painfully precise in their plans, the best at what they do and are totally &quot;stone cold.&quot;;<br />(2) WWII BUFF: you love to read about the &quot;big thrills&quot; of WWII; this has it since the German spy discovers D-Day plans and tries to get back to Germany to warn the High Command (i.e. his tap was taken after he was shortly exposed);<br />(3) TAUT THRILLS: if this turns you on, Follet is right up there with Forsythe, Higgins and other masterful spy thriller novelists.;<br />(4) MOVING LOVE/LUST TALES: Follet has always been unusually good at the subplot love stories in his tales; the intimacy level is higher than some people encounter in their real lives; the details of the lovemaking is hot.  I still remember, at one point, the female interest asks the male love interest why he never married and he replied to something along the lines as: &quot;I never loved any woman enough to marry them.&quot;; and<br />(5) LOTS OF COMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHARACTERS: especially for the villain who seems to overcome almost all of them.<br />Follet also does a good job of centering the story on the villain so that you like him and then switching over to another character later.  The transition works for a number of reasons but saying more would spoil the story.	2002-04-02

The pace moves well enough but not as is expected today in the typical 1000 page fantasy epic.<br />That said there are several fantastic elements in these stories which I rarely find in later fantasy novels so, for that alone, the reading is worth it.<br />Remember, his best tale would be the first five books of AMBER and DILVISH, THE DAMNED is somewhere between pretty good and good, but not great, like Amber.<br />Moorcock's pulp stories, which were later put into slim novels, is similar in pacing to that of DILVISH, THE DAMNED.	2002-04-01
US	52027907	R14N9VSJLIZOYX	0671725580	518520568	Nothing Down for the 90s	Books	5	66	66	N	N	Great book to read for beginning real estate investors	This book will teach a number of concepts:<br />(1) That deals can be found if you're willing to put in the time; figure for every 100 ads you call about, 10 will be good enough to make offers on and maybe 2-3 will be accepted;<br />(2) How to use more than just your money to pay your down;<br />(3) How to use the rents to pay your down payment by structuring the closing in that manner;<br />(4) How to negotiate nothing down deals;<br />(5) proper terminology to look for in the paper to spot someone who will do a nothing down deal;<br />(6) using bartering items as nothing down money (some letters in back did this in real life);<br />(7) exchanging for nothing down deals (advanced technique);<br />(8) getting short term loans (hard money); and<br />(9) getting long term loans (banks).<br />TWO POINTS NOT COVERED THAT ARE WORTH CONSIDERATION:<br />(1) CASHFLOW: it's important to look at the numbers with rents minus mortgage payments and expenses (typically 30% for rental units).  Nothing down deals can be accomplished but many times, b/c no money is put down, it puts the monthly cashflow in the negative.  Now, there are ways to work around neg. cashflow per month but, as there are better deals out there, why start there?  Anyway, something to watch out for; and<br />(2) LOCATION OF NOTHING DOWN DEALS: growing small areas have way more nothing down deals . .. places like the Calif Bay Area are less likely to have this . .. still possible but you will need to look around much more.  Options around this might be having a partner in another area, moving to another area or putting up with less opportunities in areas, such as the Bay Area, which are more tuned towards the value of the real estate than the cashflow.<br />One more point, nothing down deals work best in working class neighborhoods or lower in economic station.  It's harder to find it in middle class or upper class neighborhoods unless you're doing an auction or you just find a great deal.  I mention this b/c too many starting r/e investors think that their first deal is going to be a middle or upper class home; ironically, these tend to be the worst place to start anyway b/c the rents between a working class house and a lower middle class home aren't too different in rents and expenses.<br />I would read at least 5 other r/e books before starting on my first deal as the more you know gives you a better chance of locating, securing and making a particular opportunity thrive.too many starting r/e investors think that their first deal is going to be a middle or upper class home; ironically, these tend to be the worst place to start anyway b/c the rents between a working class house and a lower middle class home aren't too different in rents and expenses.<br />I would read at least 5 other r/e books before starting on my first deal as the more you know gives you a better chance of locating, securing and making a particular opportunity thrive.	2001-11-20

As most of my friends agreed (they wanted tangible evidence) and the opposition disagreed (they didn't need tangible evidence), it was always a standstill type of argument.<br />After a few people died in my life though, I felt that the issue wasn't satisfying enough.  So, I started to do some research not related to the Catholic Church, as the people I knew had convictions and didn't want to discuss WHAT IF questions.<br />What was great about this book were several things:<br />(1) He mentioned he did an NDE on children and retold over a hundred stories; I found it less likely children would be able to make stories up on the spot;<br />(2) No one has stepped forward to debunk the author so he must have at least got his evidence together correctly; and<br />(3) The NDEs were, again, over a hundred people, retelling their personal tales.  They were from all over the USA with different backgrounds . .. and they had similiar experiences of seeing a light and feeling comforted and getting in touch with loved ones who had passed on.<br />So, this book has been the first step in helping me believe there is something after death, and I feel a lot better for it.  For those who want something more heavy duty, you can also check out John Edward's CROSSING OVER, which airs every weekday in the mid afternoon.  No one has really debunked that guy either so there has to be more to life than just death and oblivion.	2001-11-14

CONCEPT: It is the time of mercenaries as the Middle Ages come to a close; a mercenary female captain, based somewhat on Joan of Arc, is given special military powers to fight her enemies; but, Europe is about to fall to the Empire of Carthage. MARKETING APPEAL: Main appeal to those who are interested in seeing the later medieval ages turned into a fantasy setting; Historians will appreciate the flip of what happened; most notably that the Visigoths invaded North Africa from Spain and actually started an Empire of merit over there. SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F) DIALOGUE: B+ STRUCTURE: B+ HISTORY SETTING: A CHARACTERS: B EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: B- EMOTIONAL IMPACT: C SURPRISES: B LITTLE THINGS: A MONSTERS: n/a PACING: B OVERALL STYLE: B FLOW OF WORDS: B- CHOICE OF FOCUS: B+ TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A- COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: B OVERALL GRADE: B (1) What makes this a great story or a good/mediocre story? First off, this story isn't as good as George R.R. Martin (the author I use as the best of the best in fantasy stories) or Roger Zelazny or even some of Terry Brooks or THE LEGEND OF HUMA . . . in the latter cases, I am referring to the emotional resonance I received upon completion of the story. While Brooks and HUMA are much more simplistic and black and white story telling, they echoed for me far more substantially. Regardless, this is a good story in some areas (Medieval context, usage of names, most of the pacing, POV of Ash, interesting alternative Historical points, email usage of a Historian and publisher to prove that a part of History was lost to us and actually existed) and not so good in other areas (emotional resonance was lacking for me with the characters, the usage of present and past tense during the story telling got confusing, pacing was off at times, the surprises and twists went up and down at times). It is especially of interest to Medieval History buffs, as well as readers who love to hear about alternative Historical points. (7) TOP THREE CHARACTERS: and list why . . . as to what was learned as a writer and reader. This could very well be one of the reasons the story didn't truly resonate for me. While I found Ash fascinating to read about, she didn't turn me on . .. nor did any of the other characters really. The story, in itself, has a very appealing medieval context and some good plot points and surprises but nothing big like GRRM's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. (19) CHARACTER EMPATHY: did you find yourself caring about what happens to the main or other characters? I didn't latch on to any of the characters unfortunately. This was the biggest drawback to the story for me. While I found the story and setting interesting, I just didn't emotionally resonate with Ash and, since she was the only POV in the story, that left me with no options. They say you need to like the character to feel enough emotions to care about the story . .. and, I agree. I still enjoyed reading the story but I didn't care too much about Ash. What didn't I like about Ash? Hard to say, really. I didn't necessarily hate her or even dislike her. I just didn't care about her even though she was a fully dimensional character. Perhaps I never felt enough of a weakness in her since she was always operating from anger of mistrust.	2001-08-27

(2) Not enough details on asking her out.  It basically says to go up and ask her out after asking a question but spends no time in detailing to be aware of her body language towards you.  The author makes it sound like just your sincerity will get a date.  Not true. (3) There's nothing about the whole dating game.  Not every woman you date is going to be a good match but you won't find that out until later.  There isn't anything about dealing with manipulations or certain actions that a good looking woman will try, knowing that men will put up with more from her because of her beauty. (4) Conflict resolution skills, which are vital to any relationship, aren't helpful.  He basically suggests you take everything in stride which makes you sound like you're afraid of conflict or want her to walk all over you; and (5) There's very little about making yourself presentable to a good looking woman.  Based on the reading, the author makes it sound that a good heart will land you with the girl.  Again, not true.  Look at biology and anthropology, as well as the men good looking women are involved with; while they aren't always good looking guys or guys with money . .. they certainly aren't super overweight smelly guys with bad breathe.<br />...

So, rather than be the typical guy who never tries to get advice, I decided to read several books with varying opinions.<br />One of the things I like about this book is that it has a huge list of problematic people and how to spot their symptoms.  Personally, I feel this is classic b/c it's a lot harder to get out of a relationship with a problem person once you're emotionally involved with them.  <br />How many people have gotten involved with lovers who were emotionally closed off?  How many got involved with a lover addicted to drugs or food or something else which took away from the relationship?  How about a rageaholic who would explode and make you walk on eggs?  How about someone who was still recovering from child abuse?  How about a control freak?  How about those who got involved with someone who was married?<br />If you read this book, you could very well save yourself years from getting involved with someone who isn't ready for a relationship or who has subtle flaws which aren't entirely noticeable until you are emotionally involved with the person.<br />Overall, a 4 1/2 star book.  It also has a great section about finding the right type of person and an exercise chart at the back to figure out what you want and how to spot it.<br />Best of luck.	2001-06-18

Remember, this was during a time when fantasy was just getting some notice but mostly in pulp magazines.

During the 60s to 70s one could easily believe the world was destroyed by nuclear warheads and the results ended up in a future medieval Europe with magic and technology.  Archetypes are heavy (see below for more details) . . . at its time, it was quite original.<br />CHARACTERS: they're average to very good.<br />DIALOGUE:  Again, as character introspection is rare in this tale, it's reflected, to some degree, in dialogue.  See the CHARACTER section on this point.  Overall, the dialogue flowed well and the characters sounded somewhat different.  But, no one stood out exceptionally like in better series like that of GRRM or even lesser ones like Kate Elliot's THE KING'S DRAGON.<br />PACING:  The book is sparse to begin with; only 160 pages . . . but it moves quick.    I think the pacing is great.  Of course, the pacing is so good b/c Moorcock doesn't give us a lot of details.  Everything is brief . . . succinct . . . he should be writing scripts.    Sometimes though; I'd like more details.  Have to be fair here in comparison to authors who have meatier texts; 160 pages; it's easier to move fast compared to 900 pages as the typical epic fantasy.  Back when Moorcock was writing, novels were shorter and would be considered almost novelettes today.  By the 70s and 80s the fantasy novels shot up to 400 or 500 pages.  Since RJ's WHEEL OF TIME series, the novels have shot up to 800 pages or so per book.<br />FAVORITE DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGE: &quot;The castle was built of the same white stone as the houses of the town.  It had windows of thick glass (much of it painted fancifully) and ornate towers and battlements of delicate workmanship.&quot;<br /> &quot;The Baron was almost as tall as Count Brass.  He was dressed in gleaming black and dark blue.  Even his jeweled animal mask, which covered the whole of his head like a helmet, was of some strange black metal with deep blue sapphires for eyes.&quot;<br />OPENING PASSAGE:  &quot;Count Brass, Lord Guardian of Kamarg, rode out on a horned horse one morning to inspect his territories.  He rode until he came to a little hill, on the top of which stood a ruin of immense age.  It was the ruin of a Gothic church whose walls of thick stone were smooth with the passing of winds and rain.  Ivy clad much of it, and the amber blossoms filled the dark windows, substitute for the stained glass that had once decorated them.<br />FLAWS:  Not enough character introspection . . . most of the characters were archetypes so the emotional arcs were less than say in his ELRIC series where the character is far more developed and emphatic.  Again, give it some latitude, as I believe he wrote this out in pieces for magazines.  Quite different from the expected fantasy novel of today.    OVERALL STYLE:  Again, he's succinct.  One thing I really like is Moorcock's narrative approach; he'll sometimes jump in as a narrator to explain things; sort of like Tolkien's THE HOBBIT but not quite as much.  He also has a setup at each chapter to sort of lay down the setting.  <br />THE LITTLE THINGS: Moorcock's division of the Evil Empire into jeweled masked faces in the shapes of different animals was interesting . .. pig, wolf, mantis, etc.  The mix of technology with magic made for some interesting fights and events.<br />COMMENTS:  Apparently, Moorcock was never big on Tolkien so he took the opposite approach in his works; far darker; less details; more gore; not as happy.	2001-05-20

I got through the first 45 pages but there were too many logic holes and problems with it to continue.<br />Pacing and characterization of the main character were average to poor.<br />If you want real fantasy, read Tolkien or George Martin or Tad Williams or even some of the better DRAGONLANCE.<br />Not this.	2001-05-20

But what's  bad about changing something you don't like about yourself or something that is holding you back from experiencing the juices of life?<br />A better question than &quot;I gotta be me&quot; and &quot;I don't change&quot; would be: is my current behavior getting in the way of me enjoying  certain aspects of my life?  Am I dragging other people down with me, including loved ones?  If so, do I want to change or keep living half of the life I could be living?<br />This tapes series contains many subsets . . . not letting other people wound you, taking charge of your life, looking for the things that make you passionate and setting your soul on fire rather than just going through the motions . . . basically,how to live again or intensify how you are already living.<br />But overall, it's really about taking the old you/parts of the old you . . . that you don't like . .. and changing it to the new you that you care to become.<br />The real question though is: are you brave enough to admit there's something about you that you wish to change/reinvent?  And, if so, are you even braver to walk along the path to make that change in yourself?<br />Well, are you? :)  If so, this knowledge will help you.	2001-05-20

An obvious one: as a person's wealth rises, so do their expenses.<br />Translation, if you want to have money, learn to discipline yourself now and not later.  Studies show that most lottery winners are bankrupt within a few years and mostly because they lacked self discipline.  Therefore, the problem is not the lack of money but how it is managed.  Any accountant worth his salt will tell you that.<br />Keep in mind the story is set in ancient Babylon so if you want something more contemporary, while learning, try RICH DAD, POOR DAD by Robert Kiyosaki.	2001-05-20

Not enough wonder or plot; it's more like a Historical epic; I never liked any of his characters and he meanders too much on the prose for my tastes; a lot of people love him though; if you loved LOTR then you may very well like this one . . . while I can appreciate his style, he isn't for me; if his pacing was faster, there would have been promise.	2001-05-20

I tried this with my  older brother and his wife several  years back but they were too close minded and guarded to be honest.<br />Stock's book challenges the mind and makes any literate person take a look at their own life, as well as the lives around them.<br />Even better, if you want to get to know someone really well . .. I'm talking about their values, morals and beliefs; not their favorite rock group or favorite food . .. this is a great book. Just be careful of what you ask; you may not always like the answers.<br />Some top questions . .. (1) If you could get honest answers to any questions you asked, what would be your top three and why?; (2) If you caught your father holding hands with another woman and he asked you not to tell your mother, what would you do?  What if your mother confided it was eating her alive b/c she felt your father was cheating on her?; (3) would you like to know the precise date of your death?; and (4) If 100 people were chosen at random, how many more do you feel would be leading a more satisfying life than you?<br />There are lots of others but you'll have to do some reading and buy the book. :)	2001-05-20

Prince Gaborn and his father try to stop him and in the process involve another kingdom called Silvanesti.  But, there is a greater need . . . the Earth is rejecting humanity and only one such as Prince Gaborn can fully protect and extract the powers/mysteries of the Earth.<br />SHORT WORD FEELING: Good prose but characters weren't entirely fleshed out as much as they could; great idea on endowments and how they would work on the body; flaw with villain since he was fooled and was supposed to be a genius.<br />GENRE: Fantasy (Epic subgenre)<br />CONCEPT: Lords of the lands can drain locals to increase their own powers which creates a race or super human beings and even Gods; one particularly powerful lord devotes himself to taking over the focus on two kingdoms (who are about to marry son and daughter).<br />MARKETING APPEAL:  The endowment idea is fresh and creative.

I've read over a 100 different  fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5  years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and  cliched.<br />  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual:  Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and  man, that was the kicker!<br />  Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to  choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who  won't like this series:<br />  WHY TO READ GRRM<br />  (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats  the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and  all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the  good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the  commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different  . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.<br />  (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this  gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person  comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him  back.<br />  This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die,  but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the  adventure and perished.<br />  (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was  influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED  YEARS WAR.<br />  (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID  OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in  the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the  villain, is stupid or not too bright.<br />  (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND  DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has  the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.  Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if  you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in  the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly,  GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He  purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.<br />  (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are  long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces;  something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten  suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we  sometimes get different opinions.<br />  (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is  your guy. Almost flawless flow.<br />  (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between  characters through threats and intrigue.<br />  (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each  character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story  continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why  each novel is between 700-900 pages.<br />  (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical  archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are  totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of  characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book  three.<br />  (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we  can't understand it but well done.<br />  (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on  that.<br />  (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits;  GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.<br />  (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male  author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think,  too.<br />  (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so  heroes can't get out of jams with it.<br />REASON TO NOT READ GRRM<br />  (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good  job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't  your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so  be warned.<br />  (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like  more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or  Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with  strong archetypes.<br />  (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer  that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for  you.<br />  (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in  real life.<br />  (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK:  this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some  have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.<br />  (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can  be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to  make anyone necessarily good or evil.<br />  (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's  comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE  RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're  this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the  exception of one or two characters.<br />  (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that  case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.<br />  (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of  power (one female exception). ....we                                 sometimes get different opinions.<br />                                (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is                                 your guy. Almost flawless flow.<br />                                (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between                                 characters through threats and intrigue.<br />                                (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each                                 character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story                                 continues and everyone gets scattered.

US	52027907	R3EQ7E37VAMXK1	078691551X	812062848	Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	3	32	35	N	N	Some good rules; some holes; missing a few things though	For new players this might seem like the best thing ever. I have to admit I had some reservations about going from 2E to 3E with my players but they were all dying for it so away we go!<br />I suspect this review will be of more use to veteran types than novice types, as the latter have no comparison, but here goes:<br />THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE 3E DMG<br />(1) WORLD BUILDING: the 2E DMG didn't have this aspect in it. You had to get one of the supplementary sources to figure out all the things that are now in 3E. Good step.<br />Howeer, let me point out that 1E had the best context and advice for building a world. I would say that if you want advanced techniques for world building to seek out that DMG as well as the 2E CAMPAIGN SOURCEBOOK.<br />(2) NPC CLASSES: it was always a hassle trying to make the queen tough enough to not be killed by one sword blow. To do that, you had to make her into a class and most of the classes didn't make much sense for someone who never got out and was in court.<br />Now, there are artisan classes, like a 20th lvl blacksmith, and the aristocrat. It includes usual skills and such as well as the die to use.<br />Great idea. Now, I don't have to make the court queen a 15th lvl thief to keep her alive.<br />(3) PRESTIGE CLASSES: a cool idea. These are organizations of very tough or unique people who have special powers.<br />BTW, for you 1E players, the assassin is now a prestige class. Glad they brought it back.<br />(4) RUNNING THE GAME: again, this wasn't in the 2E DMG; it was in the sources mentioned above but overall, this is great for new DMs. The book helps you describe events like one of story rather than just numbers.<br />(5) ENERGY DRAINS: PCs now get saves against undead hits. That was always a bummer to PCs in previous editions.<br />(6) COOLER PICTURES<br />(7) NEW MAGIC ITEMS: not seen in the usual 2E books;<br />(8) WAYS TO TONE DOWN DEMIHUMANS FROM BEING ANY CLASS: if you're a 1E and 2E purist like me.<br />(9) DC EXAMPLES: very helpful if you need a quick number for skill check.<br />(10) RESULTS OF HAZARDS: better details than in 2E; had to get this from supplements or make it up.<br />WHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THE 3E DMG<br />(1) MAGIC ITEM PROTECTION CROSSOVER: in the 1E and 2E rules, you couldn't combine magical armor and magical rings. No longer true. Now, you can wear both which can upset game balance potentially. Still exploring this issue.<br />(2) XP FOR MONSTERS: you can go up a level for every 2 sessions if you kill enough things. To those who want to give out xp for RPGing and other matters, I suggest you use the optional rule that tones down all monster xp by half.<br />(3) PRESTIGE CLASSES: it should be a lot harder to get into these since they're so powerful. Otherwise, wouldn't everyone do it?<br />(4) TRAINING FOR XP: I know this isn't popular with some people but I find it hard to believe you shoot up a level just b/c you got 100 xp for killing that creature.<br />If I want to teach myself tennis, it's true that I can do it to some extent by watching others and emulating them. But, at the same time, there are certain bad habits I pick up that will have to be unlearned and spotted by a good instructor. I know lots of people who play tennis with weak backhands and try to play around it. Works well with other people who have such weaknesses but you get killed against other players who slam the ball down to your backhand all the time.<br />(5) CRITICALS: in the old rules, only the die was doubled or tripled and then the bonuses were added. Now, you total all the bonuses and double or triple it. Personally, I think that has the potential to kill a lot of PCs but my players want to play with it so they'll regret it soon enough. :)<br />(6) OVERLAND TRAVEL: this isn't listed as it was in the 2E DMG. From it, you could figure out how long it took to get to certain places. Important during downtime especially when PCS are going all over the place.<br />(7) SPELL COSTS: 2E listed some popular spell prices; not in 3E; bit of a turn off.<br />(8) LESS INFO ON HIRELING COSTS AND SUCH: more details in 2E if you wanted to hire people for your castle or get soldiers;<br />(9) NO TERRAIN COMBAT DETAILS: the 2E has more info on underwater and aerial adventures if that floats your boat.<br />(10) EQUIPMENT LIMITATIONS BY MEDIEVAL DATE PERIOD: in 2E, certain things didn't exist if you based it on Historical models. This was for a good reason. For instance, plate armor probably wouldn't be around if you wanted to run a dark ages campaign and, if it was, then you would have some really powerful people around who would be harder to hit.<br />(11) SOME MAGIC ITEMS MISSING: in 2E, there were a lot more. Not in 3E but maybe the missing ones will come out in a supplement.<br />(12) LACKING IN NEGOTIATION AND ROLEPLAYING: this really isn't a problem with 3E but D&amp;D overall. When I was younger, hack and slash was the way to go with a few puzzles and tricks. But, that got old and broke up our group for a while. When we came back, I kept those elements but factored in more of a mulitilayered plot story with context, History and more roleplaying.<br />(13) SOME GREAT MATERIAL LOST: RAVENLOFT belongs to WHITE WOLF now; couldn't handle the extra work or cutting back? Also, unknown of PLANESCAPE and several other realms that may no longer be used in 3E. Big bummer as many of them were good. I especially liked PLANESCAPE even though my campaign wasn't in PLANESCAPE.<br />Anyway, my advice to old and new RPGers is to consider some points I rised. It's a lot easier to change things now then later when players are used to certain rules. Whatever the case, some things are good and some are not in my opinion. <br />To the more seasoned people, hope this helped some. :)	2001-05-04
US	52027907	R3FSDS4FDM2W6G	0786915528	342936691	Monster Manual: Core Rulebook III (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	3	13	16	N	N	Interesting pictures; condensed format; something missing	For new players this might seem like the best thing ever. I have to admit I had some reservations about going from 2E to 3E with my players but they were all dying for it so away we go!<br />I suspect this review will be of more use to veteran types than novice types, as the latter have no comparison, but here goes:<br />GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE MANUAL<br />(1) ARMOR CLASS: a variety of factors are now used to determine AC; the dexterity of very quick creatures; the toughness of the hide; the size of the creature. Some PCs always complained that huge monsters were impossible to hit b/c they were so quick.<br />(2) FEATS: yes, the monsters now have cool feats; some are unique to those in the PH;<br />(3) MAGIC RESISTANCE: this has been changed to SPELL RESISTANCE. Anyway, it is no longer set so a creature with the old MR from 2E now has to worry about higher level spells and higher level wizards dropping it down;<br />(4) TOUGHER CREATURES: some creatures which seemed to be somewhat weak in 2E are now made to be much tougher; of course, this is all around;<br />(5) DEMONS/DEVILS: yes, they no longer fell to the pressure of giving demons and devils stupid names like tannari and baaetzu. Now, they're called, once again, what they were called in first edition.<br />(6) DRAGONS: are super tough. The older ones are almost impossible to kill which makes it nice since dragons were pretty weak in 1E, got better in 2E but were never quite tough enough.<br />(7) ELABORATION ON CLASSING: a lot of humanoid monsters can do more with classes and there are less level limitations on them. Before, most humanoids could only go so high.<br />(8) MONSTER HD IMPROVEMENT: creatures that used to be set in HD now can go up to a certain degree.<br />WHAT I DON&quot;T CARE FOR<br />(1) TOUGHER MONSTERS: means a tougher world. If you already have a game going, you need to compensate for the change in power balancing.<br />(2) BOOK TO EXPENSIVE: for what you get in it. A lot of 2E creatures that are in the basic MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM are missing. What about two headed or giant trolls? Those creatures were great to have around. Lots of others missing, too, but you know that if you played 2E or 1E.<br />(3) FORMAT: the old books gave a page per creature. You dont' get that here. Yes, they're trying to conserve on space but it just looks sloppy. Two creatures detail sheets are on one page and it gets confusing.<br />(4) LOTS OF MONSTERS MISSING: I didn't expect them to include 2E monsters from PLANESCAPE or particular realms but geesh, lots of creatures missing from 2E basic monster book, which I like to use.<br />Some of them are: the two headed troll (like an ettin and troll mix with lethal damage compared to a regular troll), the giant troll (tougher and you need to do a certain amount of special damage), Dracolich (the undead dragon!), Githyanki (another cool, intelligent creature with death swords), all the different types of beholders, etc.<br />(5) CAN YOU SAY ECOLOGY AND HABITAT?: used to be in 2E but not in the new MM. Anybody going to tell us that orcs have an average lifespan of 40 yrs as detailed in 2E? How about the difference between good and evil dragons when territorial disputes transpire? How about spell components for potions and magic used from certain monsters?<br />All gone. You have to make this all up yourself or go back to 2E sources. Not good.<br />I understand there's no way to fit all the creatures in but they took a bit from here and there. Would have been better to keep the basics in one book, spread it out and tell everyone there would be a second one with the special creatures from PLANESCAPE and other areas.<br />Anyway, my advice to old and new RPGers is to consider some points I rised. It's a lot easier to change things now then later when players are used to certain rules. Whatever the case, some things are good and some are not in my opinion. <br />To the more seasoned people, hope this helped some. :)	2001-04-26
US	52027907	R3U0RRPPS2Q5JK	0880386525	635466760	The Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy (Collectors Edition)	Books	3	4	11	N	N	Wondrous world; somewhat stilted characters; good structure	CONCEPT:  A group of adventurers are chosen to help drive back the Evil from another world led by the Dark Queen.<br />MARKETING APPEAL:  The DRAGONLANCE chronicles had the whole AD&amp;D industry behind them; TSR used this tale as a marketing ploy, using their fans and game designers (to set up the world); then, they took some above average writers to do the first trilogy;  Set up in a typical AD&amp;D adventure (rag tag group of mixed adventurers off to save the world with promise of great magic, great evil, great good and an epic scale) the series took off as a bestseller; royalties were probably astounding.<br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: B/B-/C/D (C ) STRUCTURE: B+ HISTORY SETTING: B (A to game designers) CHARACTERS: B+/B/B-/C/C- (C+) EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS:  B- EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B SURPRISES: A- LITTLE THINGS: A- MONSTERS: B (A- to game designers) PACING: B+ OVERALL STYLE: B  FLOW OF WORDS:  B+/C+  CHOICE OF FOCUS: B+  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: B  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: B-<br />OVERALL GRADE: B <br />HISTORY SETTING: Absolutely brilliant.  Only problem is: the authors didn't do it.  A host of game designers, who set it up for their RPG system, ran it countless times and then hired the writers to do it.  So, the best I can give is a B to them.<br />OPPOSITION/MONSTERS:  Done very well.  The Dragonlords are all formidable and the dragons seem nearly invincible.  For the most part, the adventurers must flee from them and it is only through other means that the dragons are driven off or slain.  The means of escaping from the dragons was done quite well, for the most part, except where (CENSORED)<br /> DIALOGUE:  I have to say this is where the DRAGONLANCE TRILOGY is weak.  Most of it is above average or even pretty good.  But some of it is mediocre and a few parts are downright horrible.  Too many 20th century phrases used like &quot;sure&quot; and some are overuse<br />PACING:   Done very well.  These writers know their structure and keep a lot of surprises tossing about.  For the most part, the story never lets up.  Weis and Hickman are very good at being sure to constantly place lots of surprises, as well as wonders in this tantalizing world.    <br />EMOTIONAL IMPACT:  I have to say that even though some of the characters were cheesy or stilted, the story made up for it with its structure, sense of wonder and pacing.  As I said above,  a richly textured tapestry.<br />CHARACTERS:   Okay, this is where the trilogy gets slammed and good. (CENSORED)<br />CONCEPT: The concept was already marketed in DRAGON magazine a couple of years before the trilogy came out.  So, in a sense, part of their customer basis was primmed up for this series. Book trilogy does an excellent job of incorporating the Krynn milieu into an AD&amp;D world.  Characters are not complex and some of them are stilted or stodgy.  However, most of the latter are typical stereotypes that we are sometimes willing to accept. Also, this writing style seems to have been centered on high school ages; fairly simple with some complexities.  Simple humor that sometimes got a chuckle out of me. Overall, this series did very well.  Main reasons I can see for this is: (1) DRAGON, DUNGEON and TSR fanbase; (2) a superb design of the setting and History by the game creators; (3) lots of surprises and twists; (4) a well encompassed adventuring group (quite a challenge for any writer and I believe these two were just starting out) in which there were at least a few who any reader would love; (5) big epic scale with wonder and magic; (6) focused marketing by TSR (in other words, they did the marketing, not some other publisher who wouldn't have been as passionate).<br />GRADE REASON:   Mostly shown above.  But to reiterate, the story did a very good to great job on its History, pacing, surprises and narrative structure.  Story was lacking in character and dialogue, as well as with the emotional feeling of the antagonists, so that brought it down to a B grade at the cusp.  Overall, I'd recommend this book but warn that it's written at a sophomoric level.	2001-04-20
US	52027907	R1W94O10MWGFHE	0451148339	536609901	The Sleeping Dragon (Guardians of the Flame)	Books	3	5	16	N	N	Gamers whisked off to the gaming world; 3 1/2 stars	CONCEPT: A group of gamers are whisked off to an RPG world.   After almost slaying each other as their new personalities take over, the group sets out to find a means of returning back to their homeworld at a place known as the Gate Between Worlds. (Holds promise and attraction to gamers in seeing how these fish out of water types react in their new setting.)<br />MARKETING APPEAL: described below.<br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: B+/B/C+/C (varies) (B-) STRUCTURE: B+ HISTORY SETTING: C- CHARACTERS: A-/B+/C+ (B) EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS:  B+ EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B+ SURPRISES: A- MONSTERS: C+ PACING: A- LITTLE THINGS: B OVERALL STYLE: B  FLOW OF WORDS:  B+  CHOICE OF FOCUS: B  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A-  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: C<br />OVERALL GRADE: B (gamers/ B- (nongamers)<br />DIALOGUE:  This ranged from spotty to good.  Some of the minor characters sounded alike and it was hard to tell the two thieves apart in the beginning.  That may have been why one was killed off.  Nobody stands out greatly but overall, it's a good job.  They're all middle class college students so their speech patterns don't overlap that much.  Probably the best one is the dwarf guy, who has a bit more of his own personality, whereas Karl and Walter do sound alike at times.     I must say that everyone has different motivations and that shows but at certain points, some of the dialogue crisscrosses.   One way that Rosenberg calls less attention to his similar dialogue passages is through a great deal of interparty conflict.  The speakers are passable enough to tell them apart and then when we focus on the fact that they might kill each other and read their inner thoughts, we forget.<br />MONSTERS: I can't really give this much of a score since it was all taken from a homogenous AD&amp;D setting.  Outside of AD&amp;D abilities, like night vision and beserking, we learned little of the culture of various creatures.  Probably glossed over since Rosenberg figured that most of his readers would be gamers from the AD&amp;D setting.  Still, detailing the different species would have been helpful to nongamers and for readers seeking out some type of context to the setting.<br />EVIL SETUP: No real big foe.  It was more a series of small obstacles.  This could very well be a letdown for readers used to a big climax.  Have to agree.  However, check out the characters.  While there was no great threat, the antagonists, at first, were the players themselves.  See below (or above).<br />SETTING: Again, this area was skipped over except to place components in the story that helped the heroes achieve their goal (i.e. a library with a map to locate the Gate Between the Worlds, the arena to get cash together for the trek, etc).  The issues of slavery were done well though but this ties more into the theme and characterization matters.<br />PACING: This story moves very well.  Right off the bat, the group is heading for the gateway to get back to their own world.   And, everything they do is pretty much to get supplies or means to get up there in the first place.  One reason I didn't give it a better score than a B+ is because there wasn't a great need for the group to get to the gateway.  Basically, they just wanted to get back home but half of them were dissatisfied with home so they were torn.    Moreover, since you need to love the characters before you feel the suspense, it wasn't done as well as it could have been (see above).  While I cared for the a couple of the characters (Karl and the dwarf), the rest were just icing on the cake with bits of character here and there.  Finally, no one was chasing them and there wasn't a deadline so if they got slowed down it didn't end the mission.<br />SURPRISES:  There actually were a good deal of surprises in this story.  Obviously, being whisked off and learning to adjust to the new world was a big set of surprises in its own regard.<br />CHARACTERS:  First off, this heading has some good points and some bad points on the characters.  First, the good stuff: Rosenberg does an excellent job of internalizing the sudden problems with a RPG player becoming his character.  In a sense, there is a test of wills.  There are several times when some of the players turn into their characters, which creates problems. (REST CUT B/C OF SPOILERS)<br />CONCEPT: This is an enticing idea and I believe that Rosenberg was the first author to adapt it well.  Just about every gamer has wondered at one point what it would be like to be like the character he created.  And, most gamers tend to get attached to their characters as if they were their children.  This has a keen attraction to gaming types but I have to admit, that fantasy readers, who don't RPG, and first time readers interested in fantasy would find themselves disappointed.  See, there are a number of issues in this story that only gamers would appreciate.  For instance, trying to get a bunch of people, who are used to being independent, to work together and hammering out the personality differences.  Understanding the gaming system and dice as it's explained in the beginning.  Watching how a group of players combat their character personalities and bicker with one another as they try to adjust to these new circumstances.<br />FLAWS: First off, some of the writing was too simple for my tastes.  More detail on the setting would have been helpful, although I suppose the author could counter there was little to know since it was a new world.  Non gamer types probably wouldn't like this book, b/c of the nuances I described in another section.  As already elaborated upon, some of the supporting cast were mediocre at times. I would have liked to have known more about them even if it meant a 100 extra pages.  There were a few parts where Rosenberg glossed over <br />GRADE REASON:  I am giving this a  solid B.  Partly because I'm a long time gamer and see the nuances in this storyline that only gamers would understand, and because I appreciate the challenges in writing such a story.   I think I can excuse the lack of monster and historical settings, since this is based on an RPGing game which is known more for the goal and treasure and hack and slash than details.  Well, most of them.  Although it's much more sparse than typical fantasy books which number 600 pages and over, I found it to be an interesting book.  Again, there was a mix of the medieval thinking with the 20th century thinking.  I had to keep remind myself that the reason they talked like Americans in speech and actions was because they were americans.  Major kudos to doing a fine job with a few of the characters, even though some of the others aren't detailed well enough.  The whole idea of this fish out of water storyline and the adjustments made by the players are interesting.  Moreover, the interparty conflict gives it a lot of texture and in the process, reveals the characters.  One other thing I found interesting is the typical gamer stance of might makes right.  There were several times when some of the players were getting ready to kick someone's butt or intimidate just because they were ticked off.  Typical gamer philosophy and something to chuckle over.  But again, you don't see that unless you are a gamer.	2001-04-20
US	52027907	RZTQI83P13G61	0553106635	549456361	A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)	Books	5	729	824	N	N	An emotional roller coaster ride: bliss, surprise and sorrow	First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time                 (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic                 and cliched. Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves                 the world against the Dark Lord.<br />                So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then                 someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!<br />                Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I                 know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:<br />                WHY TO READ GRRM<br />                (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds;                 boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . .                 . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though                 their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you                 get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old.<br />                (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER                 CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes                 back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.<br />                This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like                 to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.<br />                (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES                 and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.<br />                (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue;                 lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is                 stupid or not too bright.<br />                (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up                 where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.                 Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone                 else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most                 importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it                 vague so that we are kept guessing.<br />                (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never                 get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to                 heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different                 opinions.<br />                (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow.<br />                (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and                 intrigue.<br />                (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate                 storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why                 each novel is between 700-900 pages.<br />                (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypesthat we are used to in most                 fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of                 characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three.<br />                (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.<br />                (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.<br />                (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of                 mystery novels.<br />                (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read;                 realistic on how women think, too.<br />                (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.<br />                REASON TO NOT READ GRRM<br />                (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters                 after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so                 be warned.<br />                (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this                 may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story                 with strong archetypes.<br />                (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few                 characters, this might be confusing for you.<br />                (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life. If you have delicate ears,                 this book may upset you.<br />                (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the                 series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.<br />                (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as                 much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.<br />                (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good                 young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to                 pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one                 or two characters.

First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM.  I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched.  Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves the world against the Dark Lord.<br />So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!<br />Here are the reasons to choose GRRM.  I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:<br />WHY TO READ GRRM<br />(1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.<br />(2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story.  Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.<br />This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.<br />(3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.<br />(4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones.  Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright.<br />(5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.  Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths.  But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels.  Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception.  He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.<br />(6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead.  We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense.  Additionally, b/c the points of  views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions.<br />(7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy.  Almost flawless flow.<br />(8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue.<br />(9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered.  This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages.<br />(10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress.  This is especially true of Jaime in book three.<br />(11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.<br />(12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.<br />(13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.<br />(14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too.<br />(15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.<br />REASON TO NOT READ GRRM<br />(1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die.  But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it.  He kills off several, not just one, so be warned.<br />(2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you.  I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes.<br />(3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF:  if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you.<br />(4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life.  If you have delicate ears, this book may upset you.<br />(5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series.  Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.<br />(6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much.  This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.<br />(7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero.  You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters.  There really aren't any super heroes compared to all the other characters as it's more grittier and no one is shooting fireballs every milisecond or carrying around some super powerful sword.<br />(8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series.  In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.<br />(9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception).  While this is realistic of the medieval era, some readers may not prefer this if they want more girl power, so to speak.<br />By the way, if you don't want to commit to a big book until you know the author better, check out his short story, THE HEDGE KNIGHT, in LEGENDS.  Overall, this is a great series and I happily purchase the hard cover when it comes out...	2001-04-07

It then opens with Nest Freemark, 13 and talking with a faerie pixie creature in a small town, racing to rescue a child from the dark creatures.  Nest is sort of a guardian for people against the Feeders, who feed on the fears and negative emotions of humans, and does her best to keep them all safe.  But larger events are in progress.  A demon has arrived and knows that Hopewell, Illinois will be the powder keg for the big blow up.   Amist her adolescence, Nest must help Jon Ross, as well as her sylvan friend, stop the demon from setting off this little town, which will result in overall chaos and darkness in the world.<br />MARKETING APPEAL:  The genre appeals to some readers especially with the success of Neil Gaiman's works.  As far as Brook fans go, this would appeal to dark urban fantasy types; it's well written and deals with good vs evil at an epic level in a small urban town.  Not a huge story like Shannara (I think the big epic scale fantasies of good vs evil are the bestselling stories in fantasy novels).   SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: B+ STRUCTURE: A- HISTORY SETTING: n/a  CHARACTERS: A- EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS:  B+ EMOTIONAL IMPACT: A SURPRISES: B LITTLE THINGS: A- MONSTERS: B+ PACING: A OVERALL STYLE: A-  FLOW OF WORDS: A-  CHOICE OF FOCUS: A  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A-  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: B+<br />OVERALL GRADE: A-<br />EMOTIONAL IMPACT:  This is where Brooks really hit the mark.  I was emphatic to many of the Shannara characters, especially those in ELFSTONES, but RUNNING pushed it even further for Nest and her grandfather.    There's a bittersweet quality to Nest's adolescence.  True, she has all these magical powers, which ward off the evil Feeders, but she has little control over the dysfunctional families of her friends (i.e. Jared, for instance) nor can she do much to help with the crumbling relationship of her grandparents.    Hopewell is also an ideal, idyllic little town.  Everyone knows everyone and there's more of a community to it.  That was one of the major reasons I enjoyed reading it, since it's never a community I knew or experienced.    The loss of Nest's mother, which has wounded Nest and especially her grandmother (which is tearing apart at her relationship with Nest's grandfather) was heart breaking.	2001-03-29

First, 75% or more of the humans were wiped out by the plagues and now gigantic worm like creatures are further slaying people while they infest the American lands.<br /><br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br /><br />DIALOGUE: A STRUCTURE: A HISTORY SETTING: A- CHARACTERS: A MONSTERS/ALIEN DEVELOPMENTS: A DEEP THOUGHTS: A EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS:  A EMOTIONAL IMPACT: A SURPRISES: A- TECHNOLOGY: A- PACING: A LITTLE THINGS: A OVERALL STYLE: A  FLOW OF WORDS:  A  CHOICE OF FOCUS: A  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: A<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: A<br /><br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME:  First off, I was drawn in and I usually don't go for sci fi books.  That simple.  The means of describing such a disastrous infestation would turn most people off who don't want to read such a gloom and doom story.  I have to admit that at times things seem bleak when they think of coexisting rather than eradicating the Chtorrans.  But the story kept driving forward and you're compelled to follow with it.  Great characters, great dialogues and great writing style (see below for the latter point).  This story works best for people who appreciate investigate stories and aren't afraid to read about the tumultuous emotions raging in this novel.  A lot of these people are on the edge or still carrying anger around.  For me, that was pretty fascinating.  Gerrold revealed it no only from a scientific viewpoint (as most sci fi authors do), but also from an emotional viewpoint.  Flashbacks, for the most part, connected with the current story in scope or belief.  Thus, it was an easy flow.  The class taught by Whitlaw was totally new to me.  Now that's the way a class should be taught; not with the drones we have now in the education system.<br /><br />OVERALL STYLE:  Loved the dialogue (see above).  Also loved the metaphors and similes . . . \\" . . . her head blossomed in a sudden flower of red.\\"  Or  \\"I turned in time to see the Chtorran falling forward through a shower of glass fragments.  They glittered around it like tiny sparkling stars.  In one smooth movement, it poured through the glass and flowed down off the stage and into the shrieking audience.  It hit the front rows like an avalanche.\\"  His play with words are magnificent.  I really could feel the story flow as I read it and it never ever . . . ever dragged.	2001-03-29

This one was done in the 60s before there were a lot of Sci fi/Fantasy writers.  Moorcock is definitely one of the older writers and his works range in quality though fortunately this one is quite evocative of the genre.<br /><br />MARKETING APPEAL: This story came about in the 60s, I believe, when pulp sci fi magazines were a big thing; I doubt it made a lot of money at first but it became a cult classic.  Elric appealed to readers b/c: (1) Unlike Tolkien, it dealt with grayish characters; no big struggle between good and evil; more of protagonist vs. Antagonists; (2) it dealt in an unknown world where there were lots of cool planar areas; (3) Elric was somewhere between good and evil; and (4) the swords and context of the storyline were actually quite well done.<br /><br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br /><br />DIALOGUE: B+ STRUCTURE: A- HISTORY SETTING: B+ CHARACTERS: A- EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: B+ EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B; SURPRISES: B+ MONSTERS: A PACING: A- THE LITTLE THINGS: A OVERALL STYLE: A-  FLOW OF WORDS:  B+  CHOICE OF FOCUS: A-  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: B  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: A-<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A-<br /><br />DIALOGUE:  Dialogue was pretty good. Sometimes it would get formal but in other times it would relax a bit. Overall though, it didn't get too contemporary as some authors are very guilty of doing. I hate it when slang or sayings from our times are used if it's supposed to be a totally different world.<br /><br />PACING:  The book is sparse to begin with; only 160 pages but it moves fast. I think the pacing is great. Of course, the pacing is so good b/c Moorcock doesn't give us a lot of details. Everything is so succinct thatI wonder if he ever wrote screenplays.<br /><br />Sometimes though; I'd like more details.<br /><br />Have to be fair here in comparison to authors who have meatier texts; 160 pages; it's easier to move fast compared to 900 pages as the typical epic fantasy. And when Moorcock was writing it was for magazines with limited space so I'm not going to dock his grade for it.<br /><br />OVERALL STRUCTURE:  First half is Elric dealing with his evil cousin and trying to deal with Melnibonean attitudes which disturb him.  The latter half is rescuing Cymoril (the love of his life) from Yrkoon and acquiring the long lost soul blades.  For the most part, I didn't have any problem with the story structure of this series.  It was a pleasurable read and while it wasn't great (Zelazny) nor superb (GRRM) it did fall between good and very good.  Rousing dark swords and sorcery.<br /><br />COMMENTS:  Apparently, Moorcock was never big on Tolkien so he took the opposite approach in his works; far darker; less details; more gore; not as happy.<br />What follows are spoilers and is intended for people reading this who don't remember the novel too well and wish to go down memory lane.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: Elric of Melnibone is Emperor of an island kingdom of sophisticated people whose culture is decaying.  While he prefers to think of higher matters, his cousin, Yrkoon, has designs to seize the throne.<br /><br />So when a fleet from the Young Kingdoms attacks Dragon Isle, Elric calls forth his army and his fleet to ambush the barbarian fleet.  After they drive the enemy away Elric only wishes to go back, but Yrkoon angers him by suggesting he is a coward.  So, with a heavy heart, he agrees and they go off to sink the enemy fleet.<br /><br />But during that raid, Yrkoon betrays Elric, when he is wounded, and sends him overboard in full armor.  Looks like the end for Elric BUT . . .<br /><br />. . . he calls upon the Lord of the Water Elementals.  Using magic almost forgotten by his people, the Lord of the Water Elementals assists him, returning him to the shore.<br /><br />Yrkoon is removed from his short time on the throne, forced to eat the flesh of one of his soldiers and is then watched.  But, even when things seem to get better, Yrkoon betrays them, steals Cymoril and escapes.  Elric uses magic to try and trace him but it doesn't work.  He sends out scouts and even considers using the dragons (slumbering powerful beings) but all to no avail.<br /><br />Finally, he calls upon one of the Lords of Chaos, Arioch, a young smiling blonde haired man, who agrees to help Elric in return for his services.  Elric agrees.  He then calls upon the Lord of the Water Elementals and is given a ship that travels over land and water.<br /><br />Elric and his Captain of the Guard, as well as some troops, locate Yrkoon in one of the Young Kingdoms and set out.  After having a problem with the Lord of the Earth Elementals (who is brother to the other Lord and who believes the ship belongs to him), Elric is told his ship will no longer work on land.  So, Elric and his soldiers go on foot and finally reach the town in secrecy.<br /><br />It's also discovered that Yrkoon has the Mirror of Memory (which traps the memory of any who look at it) set up above the city.  No wonder no one remembers coming to this town.<br /><br />A big fight ensues.  Elric cleverly blindfolds his men so that they aren't affected but the rest of the soldiers are affected (Yrkoon turned the mirror on the town).  Yrkoon then escapes to another world; Elric follows and comes across a red priest who has been trapped there for a long time.<br /><br />After a fight in town, they enter a cave, go through a womb and find the two magical swords (taken away a long time ago but once belonging to Elric's people; STORMBRINGER and MOURNBLADE).  Yrkoon and Elric duel; Elric wins in the end but his sword demands the blood of his cousin.<br /><br />Elric controls the sword and for now, conquers the blade but it will be an ongoing battle for his soul and already tainted morality.	2001-03-28

The only hope is to rejuvenate the Tree of Life, which controls the barrier, and that task falls upon Will omsford, grandson to Shea, and the only remaining servant to the Tree of life; a young reluctant elven woman.<br />MARKETING APPEAL: great epic story of good vs a primordial evil; runs on the bestselling SWORD OF SHANNARA; a weak boyish hero must assist a young girl, the last of the Chosen of the Ellycrys (that keeps the Evil kept captive), to an unexplored land to seek a means to rejuvenating the Ellycrys; Promises great battles, in the usual Brooks style, and the usual LEVEL ONE story telling level of good vs. Evil; <br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: B+ STRUCTURE: A HISTORY SETTING: B CHARACTERS: B+ EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: A EMOTIONAL IMPACT: A SURPRISES: A LITTLE THINGS: B MONSTERS: A- PACING: A- OVERALL STYLE: A FLOW OF WORDS: A- CHOICE OF FOCUS: A TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: B+<br />OVERALL GRADE: A - (at the cusp to an A)<br />HISTORY SETTING: Pretty good History; the lands are created after a nuclear holocaust; the Faeries of Old return to the world; the other four races which are created are men, trolls, gnomes and dwarves. Some people claim Brooks is a Tolkien rip off but I don't see this too much. The elves, besides being faerie related, have lost much of their knowledge and magic of old. Furthermore, they aren't like the Tolkien elves as they have to sleep, die at the usual human age and are not gay and happy. Perhaps THE SWORDOF SHANNARA has more comparisons so I can't entirely say. Even the dwarves in this story are different, as they are great engineering types but they fear caves. Gnomes, other than having a group of healers called Storks, are barely introduced. Same goes for the Trolls except when an army of them arrives to drive the Demons back from the capitol. I would say that the History is nothing comparable to Tolkien. It lacks complexity and details. It does, however, deal with simple, focused ideas which get the points across. Fantasy setups don't always have to be terribly detailed to be good, I have found. Paranor, the well of knowledge run by the Druids, as well as the division of the Four Lands was done fairly well, in my opinion. And, needless to say, the fight between Good and Evil Faeries may have been adapted from previous legends but it was illustrated quite well.<br />PACING: The story never let up. Even emotionally, Brooks didn't try to spend too much time on details that would bog the story down and things kept moving forward and forward. Just the way I like it.<br />EMOTIONAL IMPACT: great love triangle; that's all I will say or I'll spoil it. :)<br />SURPRISES: many but again, I can't list them.<br />CONCEPT: Save the Elvish People from the Evil Faeries, who were behind the Forbidding. The idea itself has a smartly crafted fantasy world with a common yet well detailed Evil. The true strength to the novel is the means of how Brooks goes about laying all the points about, as well as the characters.<br />FAVORITE ACTION PASSAGE: &quot;Far to the west of Arborlon, beyond the Breakline, there was a stirring in the air. Something blacker than darkness of the early dawn appeared, writhing and shuddering with the force of some blow that appeared to strike it. Momentarily, the veil of blackness held firm. Then it split wide, rent by the force from within it. Howls and shrieks of glee spilled forth from the impenetrable blackness beyond, as dozens of clawed limbs spilledforth from the straining toward the light. Then red fire exploded all about and the hands fell away, twisted and burned. The Dagda Mor appeared out of the dark, hissing with rage. His Staff of Power steamed hotly as he brushed aside the impatient ones and stepped boldly through the opening. An instant later, the dark forms of the Reaper and the Changeling followed him. Other bodies pushed forward in desperation, but the edges of the rent came together quickly, closing off the blackness and the things that lived within it. In moments, the opening had disappeared entirely and the strange trio stood alone.&quot; (see, doesn't he write great?) :D<br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME: Reasons stated above, as well as the love triangle. There was a certain bittersweet quality to the lovestory where Wil had eyes for Amberle and continued to reject the Rover girl. As for audience appeal, I think the main reasons for it being a bestseller are: (1) large epic scale woven with skill, style and emotions; (2) excellent characterization; (3) great battle scenes; (4) great yet simple details on the History of the lands; (5) love triangle that ended bittersweet.<br />FLAWS: Much more plot oriented than context related. Those who would prefer a Tolkienesque context related world will be disappointed. Amberle and Flick were unimpressive.<br />COMMENTS: My second time reading it. Years later and still my favorite Shannara novel.<br />GRADE REASON: Done very well. For the reasons stated above, I have no compunctions in giving it such a high mark.	2001-03-28

This time around it moved to Seattle so we lost most of the hometown feeling.  Seattle was fine and there were plenty of details but the emotions weren't there anymore.  No good supporting characters this time around.  It's just Ross and Nest.  I was disappointed that Brooks rushed through the friends; everyone is gone or dead except Robert, who now has a crush on her.  They're estranged since he made a move on her at her gf's funeral.  Not enough surprises this time around nor enough conflict.  Too many details; too much running around; too much about Ross' pain and his new job and his new love.<br />Emotional resonance was lacking this time around but I least finished it.	2001-03-28

It started out like a fairy tale (similar to Tolkien) and we had this intriguing idea; what if all the homeless people were tapped into special magical powers and used it to accomplish mundane tasks (i.e., get people to give them things; find food and a place to sleep).  Wizard, the main character, always attracted trouble people when he rode the bus.  This was a really great idea and humanized him.  Then, he was able to show a verbally abusive father how he was handling his son incorrectly.  But after Wizard went off to meet the other homeless people it started to lose steam.  The story spent too much time on actual homelessness and Wizard had a not so spectacular meeting with his gaseous nemesis.  All he did was turn into a turtle and go into his shell until the enemy left.  Then, we hit the flashback of his past when he was chopping off chicken heads.  After that part and the overall slow movement, I lost interest.	2001-03-28

What makes this blend interesting is Morrel's mix of the church with the violence of espionage. Drew carries the guilt around with him and worries about his soul, but another part of him is still a killer.<br />INTRIGUE: Keeps turning the cork screw here. For a good part of the novel, Drew isn't sure who's trying to kill him. And, even when he gets a lead, its only one segment of the part. So, he may wipe out a few enemy agents but it takes a long time before he realizes who's out to get him.<br />CHARACTERS: There's a great deal of focus on Drew and he's an interesting character. He isn't the typical assassin type since he bears so much regret that he sequesters himself away into a monastery and then inflicts wounds on himself with a little whip. But once he gets moving, he's a killing machine. And, I think the majority of readers find this fascinating. We may not admit it but a spy is like the cowboys of old; self sufficient and working outside the rules. In a homogenous society, this is a very attractive set of traits. Drew has an interesting mix of temptation in regards to sex with his old love. <br />THE LITTLE THINGS: Morrel did his research. Many of the means used to execute maneuvers seem to be real, as if real spies would have used them in such circumstances. This isn't a silly James Bond style story. Agents get hit by bullets and it hurts like hell. Lots of questions that Drew asks himself. Helps us understand the life of a spy and risks to be avoided (vital towards understanding the agent and making the story work).<br />Highly recommended to spy thriller fans.	2001-03-28
US	52027907	R2LY828EFRNFEP	0345335511	535136249	Pawn of Prophecy (Belgariad)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Great in high school; ten years later mediocre	THE PAWN OF PROPHECY  follows the Hero's Quest model with young Garion, who is destined to fight the evil god, Torak, and he is protected by Polgara and Belgarath.  One of the true strengths of the first book are the endearing characters . . . they draw out humor but each is distinctive enough with their emotions to be different.  However, that's as far as it goes since there isn't much complexity to them and they rarely change (I remember in the second series nothing had changed so it was getting really boring listening to Garion complain he was an adult in his late 20s while Polgara called him dear and treated him like a child).	2001-03-28

This is a world where light (the world of emotions) and the world of darkness (only one of reason and magic but lacking in souls and emotions and therefore a conscious) takes place.  Absolutely fabulous ideas.<br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: A- STRUCTURE: B+ HISTORY SETTING: B CHARACTERS: A EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS:  A- EMOTIONAL IMPACT: A SURPRISES: A MONSTERS: B+ PACING: A THE LITTLE THINGS: A OVERALL STYLE: A-  FLOW OF WORDS:  A  CHOICE OF FOCUS: A-  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A-  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: A-<br />OVERALL GRADE: A <br />OVERALL STRUCTURE:  It's broken into two parts really; Jack trying to escape his predicament from the Dung Pits and then from the Lord of the Bats; the latter half he attempts to find the key of Kolwynia, destroy his enemies and rule in the world of darkness.  Lots of good conflict, too.  Jack isn't just fighting his enemies but also his soul; his old gypsy lover; and then the denizens underground where the machine that runs the world is located.<br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME:  Very interesting idea about light and darkness and also symbolic.  Even though his novels are much shorter than the popular fantasy epics, there's a lot of meat to the theme.  Jack was a sympathetic character who wanted to do his enemies in and that's a pretty popular idea for most people; maybe even more so for the typical nerd who was ostracized or ridiculed growing up.  Even better, all his enemies were worse people than him so it was easier to emphasize with him.  It went from good to great quality when the soul was brought in and Jack developed a conscience.  That humanized him and even created more sympathy b/c he realized his mistakes in the end.    Good mix of technology and magic.  Not overdone.<br />OVERALL STYLE:  Incredible.  Zelazny was a master at creating such rhythms in his work.   While the writing is lean there's a lot of symbolism, theme and context to this story.   It's really too bad that the man died a few years back.  He was one of the best fantasy/sci fi mix authors in existence.    The interplay of beings in this world of light and darkness is quite good.  The dialogue is modern but the context is fantastic.<br />COMMENTS: The theme deals with revenge.  From one of his interviews, Zelazny mentioned that the revenge theme is of particular interest to him.	2001-03-28

So far, I've read about fifteen, listend to over two dozen tapes and spoken with a few people who are seriously doing it.  Also, one of my friends swears by Russ Whitney and did his seminar and had a good experience with it.<br />But, if you're going to start with a basic book to about real estate investing, this is a great one.  I don't believe in some authors who want to be negative and tell you about all the bad things or tell you that you can't do it.<br />According to a book I read about discount mortgages, something like 7 out of 10 people in the late 80s were millionaires from real estate.  Granted, that may be lower with all the tech companies that turned some people into millionaires but I bet it's something like 6 out of 10 or 5 out of 10 still putting r/e into a majority.<br />Conversely, the David study on day traders said something like 1 out of 64 traders make a profit.<br />In other words, r/e is set up to help you win more than the stock market.  The govt helps you by giving you tax breaks; banks are willing to loan you a good chunk of your money; as long as you have positive cashflow and r/e smarts, it can be profitable.<br />A good book to start out with before this is Robert Kiyosaki's RICH DAD, POOR DAD.  If you like that, continue with the rest.  Then, come back to this book if you know r/e is your financial vehicle.<br />Strongly recommend otherwise.	2001-03-24
US	52027907	RTL9WXHKRW2U9	0786912103	967411669	A Paladin in Hell (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A great module for hack and slashers	Well, I'm going to give this a five star, since previous posters have been grossly cruel in teheir reviews.<br />Because of the old reviews, I bought this through Amazon.  And, there's actually some pretty good plot links by Asmodeus, as he draws various devil lords to do his doings, but the players don't seem to have much control over that outcome.<br />That said, this is really a big hack and slash festival.  And,  that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  All depends on the style of our players and on you.<br />The thrust of this adventure is to put the group on a cool devil ship with a devil crew, which the wizard lends to the group, as they go looking for a temple that has been displaced.  Mind you, this is a good temple.<br />Asmodeus has a whole plan here but he never shows up.  Another devil lord does though and you get to fight him.  As you can imagine, this is quite bloody.  Pit fiends are numerous and the lesser devils are all over the place.  This is going to be a bloodbath either way and hopefully it's the devils biting it and not the players.<br />Would recommend this for the right group of gamers who want mostly hack and slash.  If you want more RPGing or negotiations or problem solving, you will need to add/subtract various points into/out of the module.  That's what I'm doing.<br />BTW, there's some really interesting info on the hells here as well as what spells and items don't work/work poorly on the planes of hell.<br />If you want an adventure in hell that has more mystery to it, more opportunities to roleplay and far less combat (yet still some deadly combat), look for THE FIRES OF DIS which I also wrote a review about.	2001-03-24

The other guy who is good is Lawrence Schick who did A4 Slavers (the best module I ever ran that was fun) and the original White Plume Mountain.<br />Although short in comparison to later editions, it's packed with 3 to 6 original thinking challenges for players.

It must encompass problem solving, some mystery and role playing. <br />The latter element is weak in this module as it's a tomb.<br />Still, there's a lot of room for problem solving and, yes, some hack and slash.  There's also an exotic flair to it as the module is based on Meso American culture so it's not the typical western european dungeon module.<br />Oh, did I forget that there's something that's close to being a Demigod in this module?  Well, suppossedly. :)  There are also about six to nine neat tricks or traps for the players.<br />Can run also as a tournament where the group has been given a poisonous herb by the angry Aztec like ruler and they have a set amount of time to escape from the tomb.<br />BRILLIANT!

Gary Gygax, that is.<br />See, most of the modules were excuses for lots of hack and slash and then you get the booty.  There were never any moral qualms, few opportunities for the monsters to outsmart you and even if things didn't make sense, that was okay.<br />But this module went further.  It laid out an overland adventure in the mountains with lots of set encounters as well as wandering ones and you even got to visit a gnome community (I still use the maps to this day for other gnome areas).<br />It also had a great underground cavern system.  Few light moments and chance to make allies with the monsters, a few who tried the fool the party and some that were just big brutes.  And, as someone else mentioned, there was a new monster booklet (most of them aren't in 3E) as well as some great pictures.<br />This is a fine adventure for a DM who has a group that are evenly interested in hack and slash with some roleplaying and problem solving.  The latter would be wasted on a hack and slash group but it could still be a lot of fun.<br />BTW, the other Gygax modules that fall into the top five are: VILLAGE OF HOMMLET, QUEEN OF THE SPIDERS, EXPEDITION TO THE BARRIER PEAKS, TOMB OF HORRORS and THE HIDDEN SHRINE OF TAMOACHAN.<br />All thinking adventures with combat.  :)<br />Highly recommended!	2001-03-24

To get there the group has to first stop in a merchant city to gather information, sneak through the first plane of Hell and probably deal with Tiamat's mates/children and then make it down to the second level. From there, they must go in to the City of Dis, potentially rescue some mortals, avoid super hot seductress she-demons (always appreciated if I was a player) and then enter Lord Dispater's iron palace which is a maze within mazes.<br /><br />Best of all, this story line is set up where you don't have to fight every inch against fiendish legions. See, the second plane of Hell is used to seeing all types and won't attack you on sight and Dispater tends to be more of a brain over brawn type anyway which is reflected in his minions. In the hands of the right GM this makes the second plane more dangerous for PCs who are used to a hack and slash festival.<br /><br />There's lot of negotiation (you have to do it as a player to live), some mystery (the players will never figure the end out unless you give it away), a chance to experience the context of Hell and some good old sneaking around to find treasure. Oh yeah, there's combat, too, but you expected that, right?<br />As this module was made for 2nd edition D&D you will probably have to make some revisions for whatever game or edition of D&D you care to use. All said, the story line, maps and details make the extra work totally worth it.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />CONCEPT/MINING OF THE IDEA: B plus to A minus; MAPS: B plus to A minus; CONNECTING ALL THE DOTS: A minus to A; EXTRA DETAILS/FEEL OF HELL: B plus to A minus; WHEN REVIEWED/LAST PLAYED: March 2001 (revisions to review March 2012); OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.	2001-03-24

It was easily the best novice module b/c not only did it have a dungeon adventure set up but, more importantly, it had a village for stopping back and forth at . . . and, that's probably harder than the dungeons b/c you have to create a village that breathes and where the people come to life.<br />VOH did that for you already so it saved hours of DM planning.

It wasn't.<br />VOH had context to the village . . . it breathed as if it were alive . . . there were little motivations on the side going on with the villagers and the dungeon was well thought out for a first level group.<br />But, TOEE, was VOH plus the big trip to the temple.  And, for the most part, I found TEMPLE to just be a room filled with different types of monsters.  It was like this: kill monster, look for traps, get booty . . . repeat process.<br />Wouldn't recommend unless your group is hack and slash only.	2001-03-24

I have the modules when they were all split up.<br />The last one with Lolth is really hard.  If you're group is hack and slash and can't handle that, they'll be wiped out.  If they're impatient and prone to making mistates, same thing.<br />I ran this module twice in my younger days . . . I'm 32 now and our group is much more thinking and cautious b/c I don't hold punches . . . but, when I ran during that time the two different groups thought they were invincible.<br />First group: lost half their party in the first room . . . and the rest on the first level (there were several levels and special worlds to this module in 1st edition); and<br />Second group: stupidly went in to a room they knew they couldn't handle fight wise but did it anyway.<br />So, recommend for the right group of PCs and DM.	2001-03-24

I was 15-18 back then and there wasn't much to thinking about how things came about . . . I'm 32 now and still gaming.<br />But this module was well thought out and centered around a crashed spaceship in the mountains.  PCs were sent to investigate and find out what happened as well as pick up some goodies in the process.  Besides being inhabited by some nasty creatures it had some new ones, too.  Includes an illustrated booklet of certain rooms and monsters.	2001-03-24

Fantasy Roleplaying)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Great, but not superlative, module; worth a look	When I pick out a module, my biggest gripe is that the majority of novels aren't well thought out and therefore have plot holes or illogical maneuvers.  <br />In order to get around this, I usually pay attention to the game designer credits to up my chances of getting a good piece.  But, that doesn't always work so I like to be able to flip through the item.<br />DRAGON MOUNTAIN is broken up in to three books with illustrious maps and score cards.  The first book lays out the overland adventure and certain parts don't make sense and are probably there to beef the party up.<br />However, the module makes up for this shortcoming in that the second and third books are put together quite well.  This is a perfect example of where you can use very weak monsters, give them terrain and trap advantages with lots of magic and they can easily mess up party members.  It can also be humiliating to the PCs if that turns you on as a DM. :D<br />The leader at the end of the story is tough and intelligent. Creators actually took the time to explain her battle strategies rather than rely on the DM figuring it out.<br />The fact that this mountain can shift from plane to plane makes it easy to fit in to any campaign.  If, for some reason, your PCs are higher level, put a tougher race in place of kobolds and beef up the leaders.<br />Overall, the idea of weak monsters being able to take on midlevel and high level adventurers is a keen concept. Most DMs toss such creatures out when the PCs get to a certain level.  This boxed set rejuvenates a weak race like kobolds.  For that reason alone, I rank it five stars as great.<br />SOHP	2001-03-23

The four areas are: winter, spring, summer and fall.  Few variations in each one, too.<br />Now, that alone would give this a four star but the author goes beyond that: she covers hair styles based on face shapes, combining colors, clothes to buy based on your dressing style (these are broken down, too) and advice for what to seek out based on your color styles and your dressing styles.  For instance, a more formal type gets certain types of jackets and slacks whereas a casual type gets more jeans and the like.<br />Excellent book.  Highly recommend.	2001-03-23
US	52027907	R3BOB3N6J86CZX	0786914343	211541001	Return To White Plume Mountain	Books	5	7	7	N	N	I like what I'm reading and I think you will, too	The original S2 was one of the more clever and interesting A&amp;D modules I ever read.  Most of the others were just an excuse for hack and slash and grab the booty.  <br />The original adventure encompassed more thinking and even a little negotiation which was uncommon in 1st edition AD&amp;D.<br />So, that's why I'm happy to see a revision to the old module into a book form.  This new edition has some very interesting twists and a big moral dilemma at the end which I thoroughly appreciate. It also has a method in it that potentially will ruin the lives of foolish PCs so DMs may want to be careful in playing this one out if their players aren't the thinking or cautious types.<br />Overall, there's a lot more room for negotiations in this series. I like that as I'm trying to push more roleplaying in my players. Moreover, the storyline is set up with four warring factions; all evil but I plan to change that to a few neutrals since the PCs in my campaign are all good and would never negotiate alliances with evil groups.<br />This game is great for an adventuring group from 7-10.  I would add that they should be interested in thinking out possible traps and tricks and also be adequate (or better) at negotiations. The weapons may unbalance the game so make them either super evil, which means good PCs must destroy them, or have them destroyed at the climax (will make sense when you read it).  Lastly, you may want to give the different warlords more allies as the module gave them a skeleton crew of thugs.	2001-03-23

He was 4 games ahead of me and in the past dozen games, whenever one of us was that far ahead, he won.  This time around and for the first time, I won 7-5.  He was shocked and ticked.  I was shocked but in a good way.<br />That told me there was more to this book than just words.<br />Since then, I've been a hug fan of TR.  I have gotten all of us his books and more importantly, listened to his tapes.  The guy is phenomenal.  You must get his tapes; he's ten times better on tape than by book b/c he's soooo charged.  If you can't afford them, get them at your library or split things up with some like minded friends.<br />Problem is: most people are fat and happy and don't want to change until they've gone through some serious pain.  <br />In UP, you'll learn that your mind is like a computer and you can do certain techniques that will delete disempowering actions or thoughts and then you can fill it in with the good stuff.<br />If the book works for you, try to get his UNLIMITED POWER cassettes or CDs.  If you do all the exercises on them (something that less than 10% of most people do), it will change your life for sure.  <br />Just remember to keep working at this techniques thereafter with a list you can review daily or weekly.  It can be short like half a page.  Just as you wouldn't expect to run hard once and stay in shape forever, the same applies to these technique.<br />Get it, learn it, love it and watch your life open up to many positive possibilities.

This is simply a great book.  LB takes several points from various chapters and teaches you about the many ups and downs of writing; all with his usual wry sesne of humor.<br />To date, I have read this book three times and every time I go through it, I learn something.  Used to be working on screenplays but changed to novels recently.  Out of my 15 books on novel writing, this was the first one I picked up for review.<br />Learn why the short story should be tossed out for writing a novel instead; how to deal with rejection; what qualities you need for writing fiction; how to work at your book (this is several chapters), how to whip yourself into state even when you don't want to write and so much more.  Great quoutes, too.<br />First book you should get on teaching yourself to write novels.  Runner up would be WRITING AND SELLING YOUR NOVEL by Jack Brickam.	2001-03-23

Books	5	1	3	N	Y	After reading his third book, you're ready for his website	I am a big fan of RK so take this with a grain of salt if you hate the guys guts.<br />First off, I've been studying money books for almost two years. Most of them were for the middle class which told you to play it safe and diversify. Answers were little and fear was great. Basically, if you had a lot of time, you could at least retire adequately from those books.<br />So then I found RK last May and what a change! This was exactly what I was looking for: not people who couldn't walk the talk but people who had done it and done it well. Understand that RK and his wife lost most of their money and had to live with a friend (it's in their second or third book) but there's no shame in this per se as some people feel. This guy is basically telling you about his mistakes, at the risk of being attacked, and letting you avoid them.<br />I've played CASHFLOW 101 about 30 times and moved on to 202 and have played it about a dozen times now. THe group I am with is positive and training their minds to see the invisible. One guy has already started to do r/e deals in Calif and while he is still looking around in a tough market like the Bay Area, he's moving along.<br />RK's books are really about opening your mind to the possibilities as cliche' as it sounds. Once you decide to specialize in a particular investment vehicle (i.e. real estate, MLMS, stocks, etc), you will need to get the information from other sources.<br />In RDGTI, RK covers how he got started in investing.  Now, some of this information will be out of your league unless you want to become a big time rich person but the most important thing is learning how he thinks.  When you know he thinks, that will help you even more so in your future investments.<br />The important things RK's books do is give you smidgens of various fin. vehicles and, more importantly, teaches you to believe that the possibilities are out there.<br />Let me stress that again: the possibilities ARE out there. The problem is: most Americans have trained their mind to believe there are very few and they cannot get them so they repeat this vicious circle. That's the biggest problem I've noticed since training my mind and learning.<br />You've got to believe and you have to start seeing the possibilities: or, seeing the invisible as RK calls it. Once you start doing that, you're on your way.<br />After this book, check out his audio casette series RICH DAD'S GUIDE TO FINANCIAL LITERACY (advanced) or YOUR FIRST STEPS.  You can also check him out at RICHDAD.COM . . .or, you can get these items for less at ebay or your public library or half.com<br />The important thing isn't so much as where you get it but that you use it, learn it and apply it.<br />REVISION NOTE AS OF 09/05/03: I am at a loss for words as to why the RK books are getting slammed on Amazon.  These are the books I started with two years ago, which inspired me to be more and never work a day job again.  Since then, I won't say I haven't lost money but I've made more money and things are only looking up.  Additionally, I've gotten involved with a group of other investors, who were all inspired by those books.  In fact, if it wasn't for the RK books, I and my other colleagues wouldn't be on our ways to financial freedom.<br />So, when people slam RK and tell me it doesn't work, I just shake my head and realize that these are people who are living in their delussions.  Everyday I'm surrounded by people who have accepted their financial cages and think things are too good to be true.  Until they change their perceptions of abundance and money, they will forever be constricted.<br />I used to think like that and had a dead end day job.  Now, I'm making more than ever and, in less than five years, I plan to be financially free.<br />Good luck to those who keep an open mind.	2001-03-23

I have to admit I had some reservations about going from 2E to 3E with my players but they were all dying for it so away we go!<br />I suspect this review will be of more use to veteran types than novice types, as the latter have no comparison, but here goes:<br />THINGS I LIKE ABOUT 3E<br />(1) SKILLS: I love that it is no longer based on your ability score.  Really lame that someone could have a high score, just starting out and be better than any old timer who had a lower score.  Now, your ability score is only a small part of your overall ranking.  Really great idea.<br />(2) SKILL ATTEMPTS:  the DC rankings, which were borrowed from other games, is a really good idea now.  I used to give my PCs half and quarter rolls to make up for the falw in the old 2E nonweapon prof. but it never worked terribly well as there wasn't much of a difference between a quarter roll of a 16 (4) and a 20 (5).<br />(3) SPELLS: there were several ambiguous details int he 2E spells and all the supplements sometimes confused things.  We worked it out on our own but it's nice to see they've figured things out more.<br />(4) COMBAT: the combat is more fluid and they cover lots of actions that come up during a fight.  Never really done as extensively in 2E or 1E.<br />(5) FEATS:  a cool idea although I make my players train to get it rather than just get it in a video game.<br />(6) BRINGING BACK SOME OF THE EXOTIC CLASSES: some classes, in order to bring back game balance after the unbalanced UNEARTHED ARCANA, were taken out.  It's good to see the barbarian and monk and half orc back even though they don't fit too well into my current campaign and will be rare.<br />(7) PARTIAL ACTIONS: 2E COMBATS AND TACTICS set up all these actions but sometimes they would break up to partial actions which couldn't be applied.  3E took care of this problem.<br />(8) CONCENTRATION: great idea since 2E always said you lost a spell even if you gotbumped and took one point.<br />(9) ROGUE: they used to suck at higher levels b/c their abilities were surpassed by high level wizard spells.  No longer in 3E, rogues have their own special abilities with sneak attacks.<br />(10) SKILLS: allowing some as being untrainable and others as crossing over which makes sense.<br />(11) WEAPONS: in 2E, the best overall one handed weapon was a long sword b/c it was versatile.  No weapon really beat it on regular and large weapon damage.  Now, a lot of the weapons are comparable so people can have some variety and not give up dealing out less damage to be unique.<br />(12) ARMOR PENALTIES: you now get penalties for wearing armor and applying skill checks, as well as losing dex modifiers.<br />(13) AMBIDEXTERITY: you now can't get total benefits for being two fisted as before.  It's a lot harder.<br />(14) MULTIPLE ATTACKS: you now get penalties to hit for multiple attacks compared to your first.  A good idea and good for game balance.<br />(15) ABILITIES: more bonus for having a 12 or better rather than having to have a 15 or better.<br />THINGS I DO NOT LIKE AND CHANGED<br />(1) POWER GAMING POTENTIAL: if you aren't careful, it could happen.;<br />(2) HIGHER LEVEL SPELLS: some spells, like restoration and ressurrection, don't have the penalties anymore as they did in 2E.  I always like this b/c PCs couldn't just pay for anything and it made me wonder why people didn't use the spells on everyone.  I kept the disadvantages of those 2E spells b/c I like the idea that magic has a price.  <br />(3) LEFT OUT SOME GREAT SKILLS: I spent a lot of time adding about 30 to 40 skills and giving them DCs.  I had to add those which took about 60 pages<br />(4) READING/WRITING: this is a minor quibble but if you want a medieval time setting, something like 95% or more couldn't read or write.  Yet, in the game, everyone gets it.<br />(5) WEAPON PHASES: In C&amp;T they broke combat which in to weapon phases.  Also, smaller weapons went fasterthan bigger weapons.  No longer the case; a two handed sword can go much faster than a dagger.<br />(6) MULTIPLE ATTACKS: Another in C&amp;T, your multiple attacks were spread out so they weren't delivered all at once.  No longer the case, they're all delivered out all at once.  Quite deadly.<br />(7) CRITICALS: in the old rules, only the die was doubled or tripled and then the bonuses were added.  Now, you total all the bonuses and double or triple it.  Personally, I think that has the potential to kill a lot of PCs but my players want to play with it so they'll regret it soon enough. :)<br />(8) PRIESTS: I never liked the idea that priests were all one block lot.  2E priests handbook had a great idea in breaking things up by spheres and granting special powers based on the personality of the deity.  After all, would Aphrodite's priests really care to turn undead? They should have powers related to love and beauty or speech.<br />(9) LACKING IN NEGOTIATION AND ROLEPLAYING: this really isn't a problem with 3E but D&amp;D overall.  When I was younger, hack and slash was the way to go with a few puzzles and tricks.  But, that got old and broke up our group for a while.  When we came back, I kept those elements but factored in more of a mulitilayered plot story with context, History and more roleplaying.<br />(10) SOME GREAT MATERIAL LOST: RAVENLOFT belongs to WHITE WOLF now; couldn't handle the extra work or cutting back?  Also, unknown of PLANESCAPE and several other realms that may no longer be used in 3E.  Big bummer as many of them were good.  I especially liked PLANESCAPE even though my campaign wasn't in PLANESCAPE.<br />Anyway, my advice to old and new RPGers is to consider some points I rised.  It's a lot easier to change things now then later when players are used to certain rules.  Whatever the case,  some things are good and some are not in my opinion.  I'm sure myopic fans will ding me with a THIS DID NOT HELP but hey, if that floats your boat, go for it.<br />To the more seasoned people, hope this helped some. :)	2001-03-23
US	52027907	R1DF6F5Z9P5IC7	0446602825	939177062	The Baker's Boy (Book of Words) (Vol I)	Books	3	31	37	N	Y	Some areas of her writing were good; others were not so good	Looks like plenty of other people have covered the basics.  Hmmm, looking over the highlights, this is how I feel about the story:<br />SHORT WORD FEELING: Gritty, excellent characterization, lacking in concept and structure at times<br />CONCEPT:  Two fates collide at the castle of the King, a noble girl and a baker's boy.  Both desire to escape from their particular lives and do so amid all the political intrigue.  (Nothing really big actually happens in this story.  Lots of intrigue and great characters but no spectacular spine to the story).<br />MARKETING APPEAL: This story was a best seller or so the cover said; I'm not sure for how long but it was well loved on Amazon, too.  Very strong and gritty characters; the plot needed work; I think that, based on the story, this novel became more popular through marketing and word of mouth than just straight out concept (since it wasn't terribly interesting compared to many other fantasy novels).<br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: A- STRUCTURE: C+ HISTORY SETTING: B CHARACTERS: B EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS:  B EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B- SURPRISES: C LITTLE THINGS: B+ MONSTERS: not applicable PACING: C+ OVERALL STYLE: C+  FLOW OF WORDS:  C+  CHOICE OF FOCUS: C+  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: B  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: C+<br />OVERALL GRADE: B-<br />HISTORY SETTING:  Overall, this was good.  The map sucked but that isn't the author's fault.  During the novel, we learned about the Four Kingdoms, the adjoining cities and the seaport cities.  And, we also learned about the knighthood, which seemed very commerce oriented.  A pretty good job was done on the understanding the political structure of the king's court, as well as how the commoners acted towards the lords.  The whole tumbling thing with bedmaids, who used the sex to rise in station made logical sense.  A good job was done on explaining the seers of Larne, the prophecy of the coming boy of power, the swamplands to the south, the mannerisms of how people acted in the lands, the politics of Rorne and the adjoining Duke with his power interests.<br />DIALOGUE: Pretty good, actually.  I could tell just by reading the dialogue that several of the characters had very distinctive voices.  Just about everyone had different sentence structure and used different phrases to describe things.  I really liked how she used her dialogue in also setting out the personalities of various characters.<br />PACING: I would say the story flowed pretty well the first 150 pages.  Four confusing parts: (1) when years passed, it made no mention of it except in a sentence later in the chapter.  Might have been good to have a date in the title or mentioned it in the beginning; (2) usage of he did this and he did that was a bit much.  The author should have looked for a way to use different phrases but apparently she got lazy at times.  Anyway, it slowed the story down because it happened so much that I began to get irritated; and (3) the author revealed way too much of what the characters were thinkings and then showed their thoughts.  In other words, everything was spoon fed to us.  This got irritating at times; and (4) the author went over things she had already explained a few times; it was really getting tiresome and readers should remember it.  Characters would go over plans that they had hatched for the second time.  Jumping around from character to characters was generally pretty good.  A few times it was a bit too quick but other than that, it was fine.  Actually, it helped hide the convoluted structure to the story in the last third of the book.  In the last third, when there should have been a gradual climatic rise, the story was teetering out.  Too much time spent on little details when things should have been moving forward.  This may have been why some people at customer reviews claimed that nothing happened at the end.<br />SURPRISES:  Not that good.  Part of the problem was that the author revealed so much of what everyone was thinking that there was little room for suspense or mystery.<br />It's weird because a lot of these characters were quite interesting.  The most entertaining were the villains and the mean ones.  The main characters, Melli and Jack, really didn't stand out too much.  I think part of the reason for it was that they didn't have any ADMIRABLE qualities you look for in such heroes.  None of them were especially brave or clever.  For most of the story, they were passive and running away from the villains.  They would get caught, run away and then get caught again.  In fact, Jack only got active when he broke out his cell really and Melli was always sort of helpless, which is fine.  So, this is something new that I just learned.  Make the characters striking and give them something powerful in personality.  Otherwise, they will come across as bland in a novel.<br />CHARACTERS: Done pretty well.  Jones spent a good deal of time giving us the details and making each character distinctive in appearance, mannerisms and dialogue.  Even the guards who badgered over stupid things had their own dialogue and motivations.  Most of the minor characters had these traits also which I appreciated.  Sometimes minor characters get lost in the shuffle.  Villains were done very well.  The problem was with Melli and Jack for reasons listed above.  They certainly were distinctive but they didn't stand out strikingly enough.  Part of this reason might be because they were such passive characters for a good part of the story.<br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME:  Loved the character details, as well as the dialogue.  In the first 150 pages, the story moved along pretty fast.  I was impressed with the spying and political intrigue, as well as with the multitude of characters all about.  History of the area was good and I enjoyed the concentration on the local folk and their perception of events.  The two guards who told stories were good, but half of the stuff they spoke about seemed redundant.  The Archbishop was a pretty interesting character, too.  Loved the way he tormented his aide and showed off his gluttony.  Some of the details, such as dress and food, were interesting.  And, the way bread was baked was kind of interesting, too.  Maybor, Baralis and the Queen were all interesting in various degrees.  The grittiness with the sex and violence added some flavor to the book, but got a bit crude at times, like when (CENSORED for delicate ears . . . :D  Hard for me to believe that this was a fantasy bestseller since certain components of the novel seemed clumsy or half written.  Apparently, it became very popular through word of mouth.<br />COMMENTS:  This book had potential to be better than it was, but I think the author got caught up in the characters and keeping the story going.  Perhaps she wanted more pages in her book than she could fit, forcing it to become larger.  I don't know.  If the plot and style had been the equivalent of the characters, this would have gotten a solid B or even a B+.  As things stand, it was a B-.<br />GRADE REASON: Pretty much for reasons stated above.  The characters were done very well in certain regards, but since I didn't connect with them, it was hard to rank her higher than a B.  The dialogue was very good but the pacing, overall structure and surprises were mediocre to just above average.  This is about the average grade I give to most fantasy books.  Some are certainly worse and some are better or much better.some people at customer reviews claimed that nothing happened at the end.<br />SURPRISES:  Not that good.

Sometimes minor characters get lost in the shuffle.  Villains were done very well.  The problem was with Melli and Jack for reasons listed above.  They certainly were distinctive but they didn't stand out strikingly enough.  Part of this reason might be because they were such passive characters for a good part of the story.<br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME:  Loved the character details, as well as the dialogue.  In the first 150 pages, the story moved along pretty fast.  I was impressed with the spying and political intrigue, as well as with the multitude of characters all about.  History of the area was good and I enjoyed the concentration on the local folk and their perception of events.  The two guards who told stories were good, but half of the stuff they spoke about seemed redundant.    The Archbishop was a pretty interesting character, too.  Loved the way he tormented his aide and showed off his gluttony.     Some of the details, such as dress and food, were interesting.  And, the way bread was baked was kind of interesting, too.    Maybor, Baralis and the Queen were all interesting in various degrees.  The grittiness with the sex and violence added some flavor to the book, but got a bit crude at times, like when (CENSORED for delicate ears . . . :D  Hard for me to believe that this was a fantasy bestseller since certain components of the novel seemed clumsy or half written.  Apparently, it became very popular through word of mouth.<br />COMMENTS:  This book had potential to be better than it was, but I think the author got caught up in the characters and keeping the story going.  Perhaps she wanted more pages in her book than she could fit, forcing it to become larger.  I don't know.  If the plot and style had been the equivalent of the characters, this would have gotten a solid B or even a B+.  As things stand, it was a B-.<br />GRADE REASON: Pretty much for reasons stated above.  The characters were done very well in certain regards, but since I didn't connect with them, it was hard to rank her higher than a B.  The dialogue was very good but the pacing, overall structure and surprises were mediocre to just above average.  This is about the average grade I give to most fantasy books.  Some are certainly worse and some are better or much better.	2001-03-23
US	52027907	R1N0R5J123QNPW	0345310160	447365852	Lest Darkness Fall (Del Rey SF Classics)	Books	4	22	24	N	N	An enjoyable read; great for History buffs; easy read	CONCEPT:  A History professor is whisked back in time to Rome; only a few years before it's about to fall; with his foresight he attempts to not only create a living for himself but, at a later point, to stop the fall of Rome<br />HISTORY SETTING: 6th century Italy; very interesting setup.  I didn't know much about it and rarely is it covered except in passing as they focus on other parts of the world.  DeCamp knows his material.  <br />PACING:  The story is only 260 pages long which is small for today's fantasy novels which go from 600 to 1000 pages.    No particular story lasted a long time.  Decamp would jump from conflict to conflict.  In essence, it began with little problems, moving its way up and up to the bigger and more political ones.  And, there are plenty.  In fact, there are so many plots and intrigues and obstacles and conflicts, that it keeps moving along.  Padway will solve one problem but then pick up at least one problem or more.<br />CONTEXT:  Sprague knew his Roman History.  There were several Historical points he factored into the story that allowed him to outthink his opponents.  Moreover, I got a feel for the setting with the incense wafting out of a door, the togas, the smell of manure, the louse coming out of the maid's armpit . . . etc etc.  Unlike some people, one felt they were truly living in this era.  Sprague hit you with all of the senses: sight, smell, touch, sound.<br />OVERALL STRUCTURE: DeCamp is really good at his structure and surprises and pacing.  Basically, I would divide this book up into three sections.  The first part is laying down the ground work as Padway tries to figure out what has happened, to justify it, to make a living with the help of a merchant and open up a brandy sill.  As high reps demand bribes, he begins to get involved in politics to a lesser extent.  From there, he starts to expand his business and make friends.  In the last third, which is probably half of the novel, he starts to run Rome.  Puts the oldemperor back on and uses him as sort of a puppet.  Moves the capitol to Ravenna since that's one of the few spots which wasn't attacked by Goths.  He wins the love of a Goth princess, dumps her to another man and then gets ready for several attacks upon Rome.  Leads forces twice against Belisarius and then Bloody John.<br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME:   Other than the reasons stated above, I like Roman History and there were some very funny parts; especially in the dialogue!<br />FLAWS:  Someone made the point that Padway was a little too ingenius at creating future inventions, as well as at maneuvering amongst all the political intrigues.  There may be some validity to it but one who has studied such things wouldn't be hard pressed otherwise.  It may have been a good idea to have shown that he knew of such things before since the typical professor wouldn't be able to make them nor perform political intrigues.	2001-03-23
US	52027907	R2VZWBJCVHJ72U	0812548051	361278280	Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, Book 1)	Books	4	19	31	N	N	Got me back into the fantasy genre; good, solid book	OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; READ: 2000 (revised review early April 2012).<br /><br />CONCEPT: A young woodsman is chosen as the Seeker, a long lost position of power given to a warrior of ultimate good in distant lands. Now, he must go to those distant lands to face the Evil controlling it, as well as to deal with issues of truth. Along his journey, his position is tested as his love for his new lady love. (This didn't hit me as big of a concept as say HUMA or THE HOBBIT. But, it attracted a lot of fantasy readers, who tend to be more thinkers, and it holds a great deal of promise). MARKETING APPEAL: This story dealt with archetypes and LEVEL ONE readers; it was above average of most fantasy novels; used archetypes and the mythical Hero's Quest to appeal; good characters and focus on context; less on plot and surprises. Richard was very noble and easy to anger when faced with lies or difficult appeal; I think this resonated with many readers who are tired of the BS in our society and desire simpler times; characters are interesting but only on a simple level; if you want gray characters and profound thinking and interactions, you won't get it in this series. I suspect this is a VERY HEAVY LEVEL ONE series.<br /><br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br /><br />DIALOGUE: B STRUCTURE: B HISTORY SETTING: A- CHARACTERS: A- EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: C+ EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B+ SURPRISES: B MONSTERS: A- PACING: B LITTLE THINGS: B OVERALL STYLE: B FLOW OF WORDS: B CHOICE OF FOCUS: B TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: B+ COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: B<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: B to B+<br /><br />OVERALL STRUCTURE: Spent a lot of time building up the characters. This is much more a story of context and characters than of plot or fast action. A great deal of time is spent playing off the character relationships,describing the landscape and people and monsters and also in laying out the History. And actually, the History is pretty interesting as are the monsters. There were several character revelations which weren't surprising in this novel since it was so character focused. A few surprises and such, too. Richard Cypher is a good and moral character. Perhaps a bit too much. He is the typical innocent yet good youth (from mythology) who sets out on a mission where the odds seem insurmountable.<br /><br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME: As described above, the monsters were orchestrated nicely into the ecology. The dragon character was fresh enough and the description of the travels along the wilderness were interesting. The interplay between Richard and Kahlan kept my interest. Enough tug and pull and conflict. Zedd was introduced naked which was interesting and new. He wasn't stereotypical either and had enough of his own lines to make him stand out more. Also, he wasn't some big buffed dude. I liked the way he manipulated in a good sense towards other people to achieve some better end, but still felt bad over it. The viewpoint of using a child and changing the word usage was good, too. The villain wasn't different but interesting enough. The sexual debauchery made them even worse. No doubt this was to create moral outrage. Have to say Richard is no warrior in the first novel but that's okay. He seemed to get out of jams enough times. Not clever. More noble and good that he gets others to help him as in the case of the Dragon. Interesting how Richard went through pain whenever he took a human life and had to deal with the results. Magic, in other words, has its limitations. Great details of the world and History; in regards to the lands being divided into three areas; the red fruit that is poisonous in the magical lands; the illusions used to fool the hero and heroine; the limitation of magic users; the confessor development and History; the Seekers and info. on their creation; theecology of the monsters was something new and entertaining (many fantasy books forget that there are so many monsters that the ecological system would be destroyed); great interplay between the lovers even though some of the dialogue was a bit simple at times on Richard's part (of course, he's supposed to be a simple character so I won't hold this against the author). Pay attention to some of the names: DARKEN RAHL (for evil) and Richard Cypher (for DECIPHER since he's a seeker of truth). Those are the main ones which come to mind but I'm sure there are others. Also interesting were the little phrases that permeated the storyline, giving it texture. For instance, Zedd the high wizard had the best ones: \\"Nothing is every easy.\\" and \\"Bags!\\" (a swear word). One other thing I found interesting in relation to truth was Wizard's First Rule: \\"People are stupid and will believe what they want to believe.\\" This came in handy during the story when many of the townfolk were told to blame the good people for their problems and used those good people as scapegoats. So too, Richard's people were told that the magic lands were dangerous to their well being and created an army to put an end to it. It's little points such as this, as well as blends with style, that pushed this up from a solid B to a B+. It would have gotten even higher if the themes of truth had been elaborated upon more so. Why not have someone who is compelled to tell the truth all the time in difficult situations to show the flip side of being honest? Psychologists tells us that our society couldn't exist if everyone told the truth b/c it would come across as tactless and because most people aren't good at taking conflict or criticism. While being honest with your intimate partner is an ideal, being honest in the workforce or with people you hardly know can sometimes be destructive. Too much self disclosure to such types looks bad and weak. Another area that I felt was missed on truth was to develop the local populace opinions on what they felt was right. While Goodkind did a good job with it, I felt he could have really mined this area more to make it more thought provoking.<br /><br />FLAWS: Too much introspection can turn some readers off. The discussion of truth wasn't taken far enough or really hammered into the them big time. The part about Richard being a bastard child of the villain was revealed a bit late and made it anticlimatic. Perhaps it was intended and the next book will tell. The story lacked surprises. There were certainly a few but not enough for such a long novel. As I said above, it was more of a page turned for appreciation of the characters than a great moving story with lots of surprises and mysteries to it. It tended to be formulaic in the quest and perhaps it would have done Goodkind well to hold back some of the information of the story rather than reveal too much up front as he did. COMMENTS: A lot of details to characters and somewhat of a hit on truth and what is truth. For those interested in such areas, it's an entertaining read. I wouldn't advise this for people who don't like innocent, good hearted youths (since Richard dominates most of the text), or people who are more interested in a plot driven fantasy<br /><br />GRADE REASON: I am giving this an at the cusp B+ (higher than I give most fantasy novels) for the reasons listed above). The fact that Goodkind followed the typical mold of the innocent, good youth on a quest doesn't really place it any higher because it follows a typical pattern that has been done over and over by fantasy authors. So too, the love story got melodramatic at certain points (losing the feeling of this being love than just effects) and there weren't as many surprises as I felt there should have been. However, it had some truly amazing characters in it, even if parts of the love story got irritating at times. Moreover, the history setting of the land divisions, the rules on magic, the History of seekers, confessorsand wizards, as well as the ecologically sound monsters pumped it up pretty high. There were certain points where it lagged at times, but perhaps that is attributed to the required page count of novels at a 1000 pages now. Very long. Geesh. It probably would have gotten a solid B+ or even an A- if Terry had analyzed more issues of truth and really pushed the limits upon the characters. However, since there was so much story to cover, I can see why there were problems in doing so. Perhaps additional books will cover these matters in the future. Of course, he would have had to develop his Evil antagonist beyond a caricature, too. I think it should be mentioned that Goodkind is dyslexiac and spends something like 12 hours a day working on his books (6 or 7 days a week). The man is obviously driven. Some have claimed he stole many ideas from Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME (I only read the first book in the series and found the passive male characters and constant meandering not to my liking) but I don't see this as much as they claim. If anything, I would take Goodkind over Jordan since there's more thinking in the head. It is no surprise to me, however, that this book broke the record and Terry was awarded $275,000 for the first novel. There are a lot of great ideas in here, as well as characters (if Richard's simple philosophies are not viewed as abhorrent) and it delivers on several components of the genre.  All in all, this is much better than perhaps 75% of the fantasy books I have read in the past.	2001-03-23

SYNOPSIS: In the world of Middle Earth, a homebody, worrisome, comfort oriented hobbit is convinced to go on a long, wondrous quest with a wise, old wizard and fourteen dwarves.  At the end of this journey lies a huge quantity of dwarven wealth.  Only problem is that it's guarded by the most fearsome dragon in the realms.  CONCEPT: The creator of hobbits and the Father of Fantasy.  The concept itself deals with a stay at home hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who is given the opportunity to partake in a long hazardous quest to recover lost Dwarvish treasures from a guardian Dragon.  Promises plenty of adventure, amazing tales, encounters with mean monsters, wizards and long gone History.<br />This is the best fantasy novel to start with for fantasy series; even above HARRY POTTER (gasp! Yes, I said it).  I even gave this  to two former girlfriends, both pretty and both not fitting the stereotype of fantasy readers, and they both loved it.	2001-03-23

I ran this as a contest of sorts on a message board and here's some info to help you decide if the book might be interesting to you:<br />Here's the criteria so that you don't go off tangent:<br />                (1) Look to how this person influenced the people around him, for good or bad, and also how it impacted later people.; (2) people who impacted their generation but not later ones in any sense got less of a ranking or far less; (3) this guy is pretty fair in giving rankings to non European types; (4) sometimes the person's goals weren't fulfilled but they did something indirectly that later became a big deal; (5) some did only one thing out of many, that may have looked small at the time, that ranked them on the list. (6) the uniqueness of the person is sometimes taken into account, meaning the event is unlikely to have happened without this person; and (7) some people build upon the ideas or methods of others so the first one will sometimes get more credit.<br />Here's a ranking of the types of professions to help a little:<br />                   SCIENTIESTS AND INVENTORS (37)                    POLITICAL AND MILITARY LEADERS (30)                    SECULAR PHILOSOPHERS (14)                    RELIGIOUS LEADERS (11)                    ARTISTIC AND LITERARY FIGURES (6)                    EXPLORERS (2)<br />Highly recommend this book.

Lots of mystery with this alien race, which is a combination of Japanese, Korean and Chinese Kingdoms.

Story focuses on the orphan pug who starts out as an apprentice to the wizard, Kulgan, and shows little promise.  As events continue to progress, the nation faces a devastating war with the Tsurani, a warrior Asian race of beings who come through a rift from another world.  In the meantime, each different character must deal with the war and its effects on their territories.<br />HISTORY:  Good.  Feist gets away with talking about only bits and pieces of the History.  Also, one thing I appreciate about his History (unlike Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME) is that he doesn't bombard it upon his readers.  Instead, the History is incorporated into the storyline as it progresses.  No stupid tangents where the novelist goes off talking about such things while the rest of us wait around for the details.<br />CHARACTERS: This is Feist's forte'.  Just about every character, from the main character all the way down to the sub characters, are richly detailed.  Just like a tapestry that entrances the eyes and you never get tired of looking at them day after day.  While it's true that all novels allow you to get inside the heads of the characters, Feist goes further; especially with the two boys (who seem to be the main characters); Pug and Tomas.  We especially are privileged to get into Pug's head where we read his conflicting emotions of confusion and infatuation for Carline, the princess of the Duchy. And, it doesn't just read that pug is crestfallen or something short.  Feist develops the pain and worries of each character where it feels justified, logical and stirring.  I noticed he did this to a lesser extent with Tomas when it came time for the young boy to decide if he was going to leave the dwarves for home during the various raids against the Tsurani.  And, so too, we see Tomas' connection with some being of old who is long gone.<br /> Each character has a clear and understandable motivation.  Even better, these motivations overlap or come into conflict.  For instance, there's a good deal of interplay between Pug and Carline in the beginning.<br />DIALOGUE:  Medieval dialogue is difficult to write for starters.  Feist does a very good job with it for the most part.  Not too many contractions and usage of medieval words that tie into the dialogue (&quot;He came straight away&quot; &quot;We both played to her tune.&quot;).  In other words, medieval slang that added a sense of realism to the story.<br />The first 1/3 seems to be about Pug and his adjustments to the new challenges around him (i.e. dealing with Carline, becoming a squire, apprenticeship, the discovery of the Tsurani); the next 1/3 is Pug and allies going to Rillanon to warn the king of this new threat (this has two smaller categories when Tomas and Pug get separated; and we do both of their stories; this is also the biggest chunk of the three parts); and the last 1/3 is mostly focusing on Tomas and his magical armor but most of the focus goes back to Crydee where we concentrate on the siege, as well as Carline and Rolands' love blossoming.

US	52027907	R3UJQ2KF2NDRKI	0441071821	440464083	Brokedown Palace	Books	4	16	38	N	N	Good choice for a different type of fantasy novel	GENRE: Fantasy (mystery and meandering style)<br />OVERALL FEELING:  Four brothers fight one another, as well as other magical antagonists, in a fantastic kingdom at the borders of a Faerie world.<br />MARKETING APPEAL: I'm not surprised this didn't sell particularly well; it was offbeat with good characters and some interesting ideas; good but not great; no high concept; mostly a slice of life or meandering story line.<br />SCORING: Superb (A), Excellent (A-), Very good (B+), Good (B) Fairly Good (B-) Above Average (C+), Mediocre (C ), Barely Passable (C-) Pretty Bad (D+), Dismal (D), Waste of Time (D-), Into the Trash (F)<br />DIALOGUE: B STRUCTURE: B- HISTORY SETTING: A- CHARACTERS: B EVIL SETUP/ANTAGONISTS: B EMOTIONAL IMPACT: B+ SURPRISES: B- FANTASTIC/MYTHOLOGICAL ELEMENTS: A PACING: B+ THE LITTLE THINGS: B+ OVERALL STYLE: A  FLOW OF WORDS:  A-  CHOICE OF FOCUS: A  TRANSITIONS/FLASHBACKS/POV: A  COMPLEXITY OF WORDS/SYMBOLISM/THEMES: B+<br />OVERALL GRADE: B+ <br />SYNOPSIS:  Hungarian Folklore style fantasy story; breaks in between with legends of the lands which gives it texture; squabbling princes fight with each other and magical opponents of various sorts.<br />CONCEPT: This tale is interesting but not really high concept; there's no great goal for the hero to pursue; it's more of a meandering style and one has to get into it for the characters and settings.<br />PACING:  It moved well in the first 2/3 of the story; lots of little conflicts; learning about the lands and the legends in between.  But, at the end, certain parts with the whole plan began to gnaw at me.  Not enough was happening and that may have been the problem.  More time was spent as characters started to slight one another, but there was too much of a lull.  At times, the story meandered so rising conflict was an issue.  Of course, I liked the story so much and side stories that it wasn't really a problem.  However, at the end, I wasn't as impressed so I began to feel that the story laggedtoo much.<br />OVERALL STRUCTURE:   The structure of this story meanders . . . taking a slice of life here and a slice of life there.  As I mentioned, there really isn't some great epic goal as one usually expects in fantasy stories.  This is one of the reasons I liked it even though such things are hard to pull off.  The narrator's voice into this story is great; it comes into the legends but is also used at certain points.  <br /> The palace is a symbol of the relationship between the brothers . . . as it crumbles so do the relationships between Miklos and Laszlo.<br />WHY IT WORKED FOR ME: For reasons stated above: this is the type of story that isn't heavy on pacing but is great on side steps and legends.  Other reasons listed above.   FLAWS:  (1) Lack of a focused epic scope or some big goal which hurt the pacing; (2) not enough time on most characters which made empathy difficult, making them good but not great; (3)    OVERALL STYLE:   His narrative element is superb and catchy.    Focus is weak in some ways as listed under flaws.  No character is mainly evil or good; all are gray.<br />FAVORITE METAPHOR:   Think of the Cellars as feet, and the sandstone pillars emerging from them as legs.  The east and west wings (the latter of which collapsed many years ago) are arms.  The hallways are veins and arteries; the Great Hall on the third story is the heart.  The high, central tower, where only the King is permitted, is the head.  Can we stretch our analogy even further?  The kitchen on the second story is the belly, and the dining room below it is the digestive system.  Nestled among these organs is the room that, only two years ago, was occuped by Miklos, the missing prince of Fenario.<br />FAVORITE ACTION PASSAGE:  She made gentle sounds into his ear as she helped him to remove his garments, then they lay together on her cloak.  Slowly, she taught him the games of love, and he taught her of an innocence she had never known.  The reeds swayed above them, but there was no wind to stir them.<br />FAVORITE DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGE: First, consider the River.<br /> Now, remembering this, Miklos decided that the River ought to rise from its banks and sweep his wounded, broken body away, out of sight to the east.  But it wouldn't.  Miklos was twenty-one years old, and dying.<br /> Next, the Palace:<br />  Now, observe the interior:<br /> And the City:<br /> Consider a tiny crack in wood that had once been bright and polished, but was now dull and neglected.  Something appeared through the crack.  What was it?  Maybe a leaf.  Maybe the first shooting of a new seed, straining for the light in a lightless room, from the dark of a soil that wasn't fertile before it became dull and neglected.  Perhaps a weed that will exist for a time, then sink to death and decay, as the Palace itself foes.	2001-03-23

Most of them were for the middle class which told you to play it safe and diversify. Answers were little and fear was great. Basically, if you had a lot of time, you could at least retire adequately from those books.<br />So then I found RK last May and what a change! This was exactly what I was looking for: not people who couldn't walk the talk but people who had done it and done it well. Understand that RK and his wife lost most of their money and had to live with a friend (it's in their second or third book) but there's no shame in this per se as some people feel. This guy is basically telling you about his mistakes, at the risk of being attacked, and letting you avoid them.<br />I've played CASHFLOW 101 about 30 times and moved on to 202 and have played it about a dozen times now. THe group I am with is positive and training their minds to see the invisible. One guy has already started to do r/e deals in Calif and while he is still looking around in a tough market like the Bay Area, he's moving along.<br />RK's books are really about opening your mind to the possibilities as cliche' as it sounds. Once you decide to specialize in a particular investment vehicle (i.e. real estate, MLMS, stocks, etc), you will need to get the information from other sources.<br />In CQ, RK covers the different boxes we all live in and how you can get out of the bad ones to the good ones.  He also spends more time in helping you exercise your basic financial acumen.<br />The important things RK's books do is give you smidgens of various fin. vehicles and, more importantly, teaches you to believe that the possibilities are out there.<br />Let me stress that again: the possibilities ARE out there. The problem is: most Americans have trained their mind to believe there are very few and they cannot get them so they repeat this vicious circle. That's the biggest problem I've noticed since training my mind and learning. <br />You've got to believe and you have to start seeing the possibilities: or, seeing the invisible as RK calls it. Once you start doing that, you're on your way.	2001-03-23

There weren't as many fantasy books to draw upon either.<br />Great system they set up for how magic works through mathematical formulas. Not too confusing either for people like me who don't care for math either.<br /><br />The book is divided into three books that cover different mythologies: the first being Norse where Harold Shea, our hero, gets to meet some of the Norse Gods as they travel in to giant territory; second being in Spenser's THE FAERIE QUEEN where he gets to meet his future love interest; and THE CASTLE OF IRON which if based on an old epic poem that wasn't finished.<br /><br />This book mixes humor, action and clever tactics. Shea isn't the big bruiser type although he carries an epee and knows fencing which lets him beat a lot of people. He also is smart in that where the big bruisers with him find they can't get out of a jam, he's there to outthink his opponents. Oh, and, of course, he also knows magic but sometimes that messes up or does things differently.<br />For its time and even today, a great book for fantasy fans. Alternative History buffs should also check out LEST DARKNESS FALL (a history professor helps Rome from not collapsing . . . sort of, that is).

US	52027907	R2FQH3MEFEKMJX	1564310159	248658617	Nine Princes in Amber	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Needs a higher rating than five stars, pal!	Man, all the good stuff has been said to let me be brief:<br /><br />OVERALL FEELING:  One of my favorite fantasy pieces; sort of starts out as a PI man who lost his memory and has to figure out that he's the prince of another world.<br /><br />CONCEPT: What if Gods who looked like people created this world and all the other worlds through their Godly thoughts? And what if their father disappeared and there was a fight for the throne which shook all the worlds? And what if this Godly war led to doorways being opened which should not have opened which could kill off these Gods?<br /><br />MARKETING APPEAL: The Amber series is greatly loved; I imagine that it sold well; it took a first person point of view of a wise cracking PI type fantasy hero who discovered the realm of Amber; a conflict of sibling gods who are out for dominance and then discover a great evil.  Superbly written.<br /><br />FAVORITE METAPHORS: \\"The night was bargaining weakly with the sun.  The rising sun cast billions of bright shards into the foaming swell of the waters, and our eyes were dazzled by their dance so that we could not see beneath the surface.\\"<br /><br />\\"The devil danced in his blue eyes . . . \\"<br /><br /> \\"I saw the fleet, sailing on a great ocean the color of blood.  FAVORITE ACTION PASSAGE:  As soon as we came to a halt, I flung open my door and leaped out --- barefooted yet!  ... it!\\"<br /><br />\\" We pushed on, slowly, and there was blood on every step for as far back as I could see.  There's a moral there, somewhere.\\"<br /><br />FAVORITE DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGE:  \\"It was about eight o'clock when the cab deposited me on a random corner in the nearest town.  I paid off the driver and walked for around twenty minutes.  Then I stopped in a diner, found a booth and had juice, a couple of eggs, toast, bacon and three cups of coffee.  The bacon was too greasy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Very, very much would they pay.  An anger, a terrible one, flared within the middle of my body.\\"<br /><br />\\"Answers?  None.\\"<br /><br />DIALOGUE:  I really liked the dialogue.  It was terse and to the point with witty remarks all over the place, as well as some deep insights.  Does a good job of not telling too much in the dialogue.  No one is an idiot or constant talker.  All, are sort of street smart.  Corwin also has this fatalist attitude that I like.  At times, he wonders as to the words he uses which makes it feel only more so that you are involved in the discussion with him (even if you can't talk back and ask questions).  Good threats, too.<br /><br />\\"Blood!\\" I called out.  \\"Give me blood and vengeance this day, my warriors, and you will be remembered in Amber forever!\\"  And as a man, they raised their weapons and cried out, \\"Blood!\\"  And gallons --- no, rivers --- of it were let that day.  We destroyed two more of Caine's raiders, replenishing our numbers from those of the survivors of our own fleet.  As we headed toward a sixth, I climbed the mainmast and tried to take a quick count.<br /><br />\\"Catch them, you fool!\\"  And he did.<br /><br />All I have to say is that Zelazny is my my favorite fantasy writer next to only one other writer: George Martin who is known for his incredible A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series. This is surely one of the best series in fantasy even though it was written in the 1970s.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus to A; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; FRESHNESS (for its time): A to A plus; SETTING/TONE: B plus to A minus; NARRATIVE FIRST PERSON FLOW: A minus; OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A; WHEN LAST READ: 2001 (read three times) (revised review early April 2012).	2001-03-23

They are:<br />(1) BUY AND HOLD: this is what the Motley Fools, as well as Peter Lynch, like.  You pick great companies through research and buy shares when the company is down.  Stockpile and wait at least 10 yrs; preferably more.  At the end, you should havea lot of cash for retirement.  Great for people who don't want to do a lot of work and have time to do this; not great if you want to make money faster though.<br />(2) O'NEIL STRATEGY: based on William O'Neil's HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS and 24 ESSENTIAL LESSONS FOR INVESTMENT SUCCESS.  O'Neil picks great companies, too, but watche them on various graphs.  Based on the curves, he knows when to sell and tends to do it within a few months to 2 years I believe.  O'Neil doesn't believe in diversifying which, according to Robert Kiyosaki in RICH DAD, POOR DADY, is something you have to give up to make more money.  <br />See, most of the rich concentrate their money.  The middle class tend to spread it all around so even though their risk is far less, their gain is, too.<br />(3) TRADERS: these are the people who trade every week or monthly or even daily.  According to the Davis study, 1 in 68 make a profit.  Of course, if you have the right temperament and know the system, you can make a profit.  But, I think that group is small.  Check out Van Tharp's TRADE YOUR WAY TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM.<br />So, the overall point, is that this book is great for strategy number one.  It really comes down to your values on risk and your strategies.  Personally, if you choose to go with #1, I would say this is the best book I have read on it so far.<br />As for the fluctuations, I wouldn't worry about it.  Anyone who knows the stock market, shouldn't look at the Foolish  Four averages every day unless they want ulcers.Once a year is fine and their method has worked pretty well since the early 60s contrary to what the doomsayers say.<br />In the future, ask yourself this: would you rather take the advice of journalists and commentators who make maybe 30-50k or people like the MF who most likely make more than that and have devoted years of their lives to studying a system?	2001-03-23

To top it off, his old nemesis, who he doesn't know about, is on the prowl, wiping people out left and right.  And, to make it even worse, he's a ninja.  Nicholas, while trying to find Saigo, before he kills all his friends; disappears as we flash back to the earlier History of Nicholas' parents.<br />CONCEPT:  First off, it was a timely time to come out . . . right when Japan was doing very well economically (they had started to beat the auto industry) and Americans wanted to learn more about the culture.  Toss in a secret group of assassins (known as the ninja) and toss it in New York with promises of sex, corruption and intrigue . . . and we're off to a good start.<br />SPYS/GADGETS/SKILLS:   This is where Lustbader excels.  There's a plethora of information here about the History of Japan (and even a bit about China) in explaining the origins and continuation of the ninja.<br />(REST CUT OFF BECAUSE OF SPOILERS)<br />PACING: Story moves along nicely.  Lustbader knows how to build the story up to a cliffhanger and then use something big to perk our interest before he jumps back to a flashback/another era.  Lustbader tries to jump around with lots of different stories and tends to focus on these areas: (1) dark subjects or mystery; (2) sex; (3) Japanese History/Asian History; (4) lovers conflict; or (5) seedy murder investigations.  That seems to be his basic formula in the topics he chooses.<br />OVERALL STYLE:  This guy has great metaphors; I must have marked over 60 in the book and it's only about 500 pages long!     THE LITTLE THINGS:  Great details about the outdoors; especially the waves of the oceans and the manner in which the sunlight plays on them.  Good character actions during dialogue moments, too.	2001-03-23

So, rather than just bash everything, PCs can talk their way out or even make alliances.  Additionally, not all the creatures of the Underdark are out to kill you so it allows more chances to talk things out. ;<br />(2) There's a great deal of context and History; especially in book one in the area of Haranshire (a backwaters shire); good to great character descriptions.;<br />(3) superb overland map you can share with your players (just don't show the back); include a few battle maps for key sections of the long adventure);<br />(4) Lots of overland adventures; some not just fighting but puzzle related or negotiation related; additionally, you get to deal with the locals;<br />(5) Great details of natural hazards in the Underdark;<br />(6) A variety of different monsters in the Underdark;<br />(7) fairly good linkage;<br />(8) big finale at the end; and<br />(9) PCs have the opportunity to actually have allies!<br />I think past reviewers are correct in that book two isn't as linked.  This was done mainly to let the PCs go up in levels so that they would be ready for the later big fights.<br />Not a problem for me.  I increased the size of the map and added more features and also changed the nefarious end as I felt it was too cliche'.<br />Overall, this is superlative boxed set.  As it isn't terribly pervasive, it can fit in to almost any campaign.  For a DM who has little put together, you could do a whole campaign this way but the PCs have to enjoy tromping down in the Undearkr. In my campaign, this started at about 50% of the possible adventures but as more and more happened, it's about 15-20% now.  That's sort of b/c now that they're higher level they've gotten involved in big time politics. :)<br />...	2001-03-22

So, I'm not sure where these comments come from wanting middle eastern knights.  They weren't knights.  They had different names.<br />The scope of this book covers the Hundred Years War to the aftermath of the Wars of the Roses . . . expect to cover mostly French and English History, as these were the two cultures who began the chivalric code and were the main players during that era.<br />While it's true that there were knights in other areas of western and eastern Europe, they all emulated the French and the English.  That's why Turnbull spent his time with these two countries.<br />If you want a similar example to THE MEDIEVAL KNIGHT but hate anglocentric History, check out his THE BOOK OF THE  SAMURAI or even THE MONGOLS.  Just stop whining! :D	2001-01-02
