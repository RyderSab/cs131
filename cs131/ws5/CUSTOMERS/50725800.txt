Curious guy (just the right mix of scruffy and sensitive) finds the diary and - viola - happens to be on his way back to London. He reads just enough to be intrigued, but meets diary author's roomie first and has a fling there. Diary author is an uptight, overachieving lawyer who has some real issues with men. But - well, we all knew where this one was going from the start, didn't we? It's still fun, if a little confusing in parts (and to be fair, I was reading this at night during the holiday season when I have a zillion things going on. Perhaps if I could have just sat down and read it, it would be been easier to keep up with.) At any rate, I'll look for more by this author.	2004-12-31

While I'm not sure that it's good enough to pay full fare twice, it's surely worth buying once! It's so hard to convey how special this book is. Rebecca Campbell has a truly quirky style, a real gift in a world of solid-but-conventional authors or (more likely) mediocre writers who write to a formula. There are a handful of wonderful and creative - but not bizarre - authors, and she's quickly joining their ranks. The story is, on the surface, about Alice, a science books expert at a minor (but trying!) auction house in London. But the story is as much about those in Alice's life as it is about her - including the Dead Boy. (Literally, a boy she saw killed in a pedestrian/car accident, whom she falls in love with.) Campbell takes a story line that could either be preposterous or weighty and makes it a page turner. There's lots of humor, but there's a deep undercurrent as well. My only complaint (and I'm sure that's more a sign of my age, not the author's talent) is that the language is \\"rough\\" (profanity) in spots (including a passage that is devoted to my least favorite word in the English language). Yet the writing is never rough, her gift with dialog is superb and this book is not to be missed by the fans of contemporary fiction. (Note, this is not a book for chicks only - it's really a wonderful novel for anyone.) <br />  <br />	2004-08-31

So let me tell you what I think - Kelly Harte writes a likeable, funny, fast-paced novel that you can spend a summer's day reading (or a winter's night). Nothing deep here - but it's fun. I don't find the main character unlikeable at all (as one reviewer notes) - she's not sickly sweet, but goodness who is? Sure, the plot is far-fetched, but I don't read books like this to stay rooted in reality. Overall, it was a very entertaining tale, and I'd certainly recommend it.	2004-06-20

Katie does have somewhat of a regular format - protagonists that seem ill-suited, but turn out to be perfect. And there's never any London glamour and glitz. But another always-present element of the Fforde formula is sold writing, great plot lines, witty (yet believable) dialog. Restoring Grace is no exception - in fact, its one of the best of her books, certainly the best one of recent years. That's not to say that Paradise Fields or Highland Fling weren't good, they were - but Restoring Grace is fabulous. So, what's it about? Grace has been left at odds - her ex-husband has left her with a nice bed, great linens, and a historical house that's rotting away, requiring repairs far beyond her marriage settlement or her meager earnings as a wine writer. Ellie is an artist with  a handsome, charismatic boyfriend - who has no interest in becoming a father. Which is problematic, since Ellie is pregnant and determined to have the baby. Ellie and Grace fall together and discover some potentially valuable paintings in Grace's rotting home. Along the way, they also discover a surly-on-the-outside, solid-gold-at-heart local land developer and a prickly-on-the-outside but (yes, here it comes) solid-gold-at-heart art restoration expert - and you know where this is going, but the fun is all in getting there. Add in Grace's horrid siblings, very weird ex-husband (what DID she see in him), ex-husband's first wife, ex-step-daughter - well, a cast of characters that goes on and adds to the humor of the story. And as the extra icing on the cake - Flynn (surly land developer) is really the best \\"leading man\\" Fforde's written in years. His character (and attractiveness) just leap off the page. A must read, whether you're a long-time Fforde fan or just discovering her for the first time.	2004-06-04

And yet...I did read this in virtually one sitting. And yet...I did go out immediately and buy the second book in the series. And yet...I will go out and buy the third! So, I guess Feather can say, &quot;mission accomplished&quot;! I do like the fact that someone can write a historical romance about other periods than the Regency,medieval times, or (shudder) the Old West. And the sufferagette angle is wonderful as well. But holy cow, are we really expected to believe these three went out and just got rid of their virginity? And that Max (and the other men they are likely to run up against) would be OK with that? I like a bit of fantasy, but it really needs to be grounded in reality! The dialog comes and goes, sometimes sharp and well-done, often sloppy. And enough about the food already!	2004-03-16

Part two of a three-part series, the Bride Hunt brings together two very unlikely characters. Common enough plot device - but in this case you really just wonder if they'll end up hating each other in a year or so. This book was definitely written with more care and consideration of the plot than The Bachelor List (part one of the series), so kudos for that. I think that with about 50 more pages I might have been made to believe that these two belong together - but ultimately, there just wasn't enough. I do have to admit that I'll be out in April to buy the third installment - the male character (briefly revealed in this book) looks a bit different, and interesting. Let's hope third time is a charm.	2004-03-16

Jenna is a tiny, insecure - yet somehow tough and no-nonsense - PR professional. She's been brought in by a mega-conglomerate to help makeover the image of a bad-boy pro hockey team.  Ty is the captain of the team - and not interested in doing anything for the (typically clich, but clichs are based on reality) heartless corporate owners. And he's not especially interested in doing anything for Jenna, with her annoying habit of pestering him. And we all know where this is going to lead - and it does, with enough fun and enough angst to keep you reading on. A subplot involves Jenna's best friend who is assaulted by another member of the team - and pay attention, because this comes back in Martin's second book, Fair Play.  I do find it interesting that most reviewers just love this book, but many come down hard on Fair Play. As readers, are we only willing to accept that the male character is the pig-headed one that needs to be brought 'round to the joys that love and marriage can bring? I actually liked Fair Play a bit more - and I think it was the twist that that woman is the difficult one that made it a better read for me. Just a thought. At any rate - buy 'em both, read them in order - all in all, good fun.	2004-03-16

I'm a fairly critical reader - I don't like most \\"contemporary romances\\", I find that they are usually poorly written with uninteresting characters.  I really prefer British \\"chick lit\\", chock full of odd characters who are often difficult to \\"like\\" but who are always very interesting. Maybe that's why Theresa doesn't bother me the way she seems to bother some of the other reviewers. Hey, she's had a terrible experience (thus the weirdness about hockey players) and like a lot of people (at least a lot of people in fiction!!) she is trying to run away from home (even though she's all grown up). Oh, I'm not a complete sour puss - I think Michael is perfect (yeah, maybe too good to be true but it's fiction!!) Weak spots - Reese (too one-dimensional, we could all smell a stinker except Theresa - good villains are always more complex) and I agree that a bit more humor between all of the characters could help. I'll definitely look for her first, Body Check, and be on the lookout for more from this author!	2004-03-12

With A Girl's Best Friend, she manages to balance all of the elements - the story isn't too sweet and sappy, but you definitely feel good after finishing it. Izzy is an estate agent in the London area, she's seeing the lovely Leo. Well, he's lovely except for the fact that she never seems to come first with him. Izzy has a great circle of friends - and through them she meets Nick, a Vet in a corner of Devon. Together, they play an important part in a house party murder mystery game. Simple enough - but after that weekend, Izzy's life starts to take a different direction. Naturally, all's well that ends well (for several people and one wonderful dog). In fact, this book features one of the best (if not THE best) \\"Big Romantic Gestures\\" I've read - Nick knows the way to a woman's heart is through her dog! Young manages a sharp and often sarcastic wit that never turns bitter or biting, Izzy is self-deprecating without being whiny or psycho. And, unlike many books, the spark between the two main characters rings true. A lovely, lovely book! --	2004-01-30

I'm as big of a chick lit fan as the rest of you, but this one bridges the gap - funny, full of relationships -but a better written piece of fiction than most chick lit. I've read Melissa Nathan's other books - and loved the Jane Austen twist and the cute plots and clever dialog. Liking those books as I did, I made a point to purchase The Nanny as soon as it came out in paperback.  I was blown away by this book, this is in another class!  Nathan's talent seems to have just exploded - this book is much more satisfying. It's still full of her trademark humor (a bit sarcastic and I love it - but it's not off-putting). The plot takes several wicked twists with all kinds of roadblocks being thrown up for our Jo, the nanny. But it's the complexity and the finesse of this book that really grabs you - it's just a darn good tale. Jo leaves her safe village and her safe (it seems) relationship with Shaun, her friends, her family to go off the London to care for three (sometimes more) children, the offspring of Dick and \\"Scary Spouse\\" (as her eldest stepson, the Hornblower look-alike Josh, calls her.) Well, obviously no good can come of this drastic move and soon Jo's world is completely turned over - as is everyone else's' in the book. All through, it's funny, sad, gentle, abrasive, silly, profound. Jo emerges a stronger and happier person at the end, as does pretty much everyone that you might care about in the book. You know that the ones you don't care about get what they deserve too - always satisfying! And best of all, although the ends aren't tightly tied up at the end, you also know it's all going to be OK for the good guys	2004-01-30

I note that the original Gannon brother story was weak only to draw the comparison to this short novel. Sean is a much stronger story and worth the time and money. Sean is the oldest brother (but not the oldest sibling) of the Gannon family, married to his job as a US Marshall. He meets his match on vacation, in the form of a driven, over-achieving judge from his home town of Alexandria, LA. This is not great literature folks, but it's a fun story.

At first, you think it's just the perfect light reading for summer - and it is. It's not long, big type, lots of white space (easy to find your place again after you doze off reading it at the beach!) It seems like a typical girl meets boy book.

Now there's drama 60 feet under the surface of the ocean! Next you're pondering what we all expect out of our relationships, and ourselves and how our past prevents us from achieving our future.

One Hit Wonder is truly different from many of the books of this genre - it's all about solving a mystery. No, not a blood `n guts, running through the alley mystery. This is about Ana solving the mystery of herself, with her (dead) sister providing the guidance, if you will. It's sad in places, very funny in others, but engrossing throughout. From the synopsis, you can see that Ana comes to London to collect her dead (from apparent suicide) sister's things. She ends up staying on with Bee's friends and finding out more about herself (and her sister, her family) in a few weeks than she has in her whole life. Naturally, she find love, but even that is a quirky, odd story that adds to the charm of the book.	2002-06-20

You can gather the basic plot twists from the other reviews, but please know this - the quality of writing turns a basic soap opera plot into a wonderful literary experience. You almost believe the marital affair is truly happening, and know that if it didn't then, it was going to sometime.

Last Chance Saloon (like all of Keyes' books) has all the elements of girly fiction - love, sex, conflict, nice clothes, insecurities about (fill in the blanks), food, booze, bad boys, nice boys. But don't confuse this with all of those other light and fluffy trifles that are out there now. The writing is razor sharp, the characters - while often really, really \\"out there\\" - are believable and incredibly well done. You can tell from the synopsis ...the basic three characters (Tara, Fintan, and Katharine), but the secondary characters really move the plot along - Lorcan, aside from being King Rat, is such a clever plot device. Ultimately, you'll pick your favorites. Mine was Joe (I know, no imagination on my part, the classic romantic hero!) I absolutely loved the email exchange over the bath mat \\"Not soon enough, fear I might slip and fall\\". It's daffy, but sweet. And, along with everyone else, I was horrified at the reactions of all three (Fintan with his surliness, Tara with the hopeless lack of self-esteem, and Katherine with - well, I won't spoil the end), but isn't that like real life? What isn't like real life is that all's well that ends well for the good guys (including Lorcan's hopeless sidekick!) and the baddies get their just deserts. Keyes always has a bit of a morality play going on with her writing and the lessons learned here are priceless. Another fabulous effort - read it! And if you haven't read her others, read them. Rachel's Holiday is my favorite, but you can just pick at random and be rewarded.	2002-06-04

OK, OK, I'm going to say something that annoys me when others say it. But this book definitely has a been there/done that/read it aura to it.  I know, I know - when you read a Cynster novel you expect certain elements and would be bored and disappointed if they weren't there. But up to now, they've been presented in a fresh and interesting way each time (in my opinion).  This one does become a tad tedious, basically lots of frustrated introspection by the two main characters in-between sex scenes. Laurens continues to write the best scenes of passion around, but you sense in this book that she's just sitting there going, \\"OK, it's time for a bit of passion here, which variation do I put in now?\\" <br />I do applaud Laurens for attempting a new approach to the basic romance plot - from the get-go, these two know that they are going to get married. I also like Luc as a character very much - since HE'S not the Cynster, he's allowed to be a bit more vulnerable and (gasp) insecure, at least where Amelia is concerned.  I didn't exactly not like the character of Amelia, but she really didn't pop off the page the way Cynster heroines usually do, including her sister Amanda. Her character here didn't ring true with what we know of Amelia in previous books. Yes, she's determined and has a will or iron (she is a Cynster, after all) but she was supposed to be the more thoughtful, reticent sister. Yikes. She did everything but put on a black leather bustier and pull out a whip in this book! <br />The subplot (mysterious thefts) was so underdeveloped that it seemed supremely trivial. Laurens has shown in the past that she knows how to use the subplot to move the main plot along, but this one just doesn't ever get in stride.<br />My verdict - well, if you are a Cynster series fan, of course you simply must read this book. On my list, however, it falls at the bottom (even below the Lucifer and Phyllida story). I know that Laurens is planning a tale around the younger cousin Simon (who appears here). We may even be getting a glimpse of his intended female (Luc's strong-willed tomboy baby sister). Perhaps refocusing on a red-blooded Cynster male (in a different time frame) will revitalize the writing. Remember - we love the scenes of passion, but we want a fabulous Stephanie Laurens story to go along with it!	2002-05-08

In fact, it borders on being more of a novella than a novel, but let's not quibble. Margolis does a much better job than many ohers at drawing an effective mental picture of a struggling standup comic. Even so, these bits are not the book's strongest. To be fair, it's very hard to do this -  of our enjoyment of stand up comedy is in the comedian's delivery and timing and it's difficult for readers to replicate this while we are reading.  What she is better at is gently poking fun at cultural style-setters, dentists, Jewish mothers, men - well, quite a list.  Her use of language is clever and she managed to portray absolutely absurd scenarios in a way that seemed normal. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the romance between Rachel and Matt (the washer repair guy) - they seemed to fall in \\"real love\\" pretty quickly (after a couple of fairly interesting sex scenes). But, since the whole thing is a bit of a modern fairly tale, perhaps that's just perfect. I really loved the insane rival comic (the airport scene is very funny) and Matt's flatmate, Tractor. Definitely worth a look.	2002-04-29

I'd read two others by her - Sun and the Moon and Silken Threads (both wonderful) and tracked this one down. It was worth the effort. Corliss and Rainulf are spectacular, two individuals who need to be their own person but also need each other. The supporting characters create a fascinating story that will keep you up late at night, not wanting to put the story down. Ryan also does a fabulous job of building the passionate tension between Corliss and Rainulf and bringing them together in a memorable fashion.	2002-04-24

Of course, a gently reared woman (even a Cynster) would never really behave the way that she does in this book. But as a piece of lively fiction, this is one of the best! As usual, the relationships between the characters are well drawn out. Family, honor, real love, and passion are uppermost in importance. Laurens writes the best love scenes out there - steamy but never degrading or gratuitous. One teeny complaint - Laurens has always had a wonderful way with dialog, but it turns a bit turgid here - all seething passions and what have you. For those who insist on ranks and comparisons, I'd say that this rates about 3rd or 4th as my favorite in the entire Cynster series. And we find out a teeny bit about who Amelia has her sites set on and he looks very, very interesting - I can hardly wait for May!	2002-04-24

This is the perfect book to read for light diversion - it's not deep, mysterious and depressing (think P D James), but it does provide some fun reading. I honestly don't know how accurate her portrayal of this time period is, but it rings true when you read it. For the most part, the main characters are well developed and the dialog is good. I believe we may be seeing the emergence of some additional secondary characters in this book, which would be good. In fact, one of the old standby secondary characters - Sarah's neighbor - and her son take center stage, as the son is accused of the murder of a woman of doubtful character. I'll be honest - I figured out \\"who done it\\" before the end, and even suspected the \\"surprise twist\\". However, as always, I enjoy the banter and growing relationship between Sarah and Frank and find the time period irresistible. Oh yes - Sarah and Frank...Thompson is going to drive us batty waiting to see if they will ever get together. Significant \\"progress\\" is made in that direction (if you can call it that) in this book, but Thompson also does an admirable job of showing us the obstacles of class, religion, and social circumstances that these two have to overcome. She may have even introduced a longer-term rival for Sarah's affections (and surely there's a nice Catholic girl out there to turn Frank's head and make Sarah stand up and take notice!) All in all - fun reading, great for the upcoming summer.	2002-04-19

For this genre (and we all know what it is!!) \\"Perfect Timing\\" is, well, perfect. Yes, some of the characters and plot lines are a bit over the top, but life can be a bit wacky too. The dialog is funny and the story moves along just like you'd want it to. I like the twist on the story that's too good to be true - we all know that if it seems too good to be true, it usually is. For those of you who aren't familiar with Jill Mansell's books, she usually takes one or two outrageous elements to begin with. To this, she adds a cast of totally realistic and believable characters that make the whole thing ring true. The result is just enough escapism, with a good balance of real life. She also writes solid dialog that rings true, with gentle humor and wit. She's written many, many wonderful books - too bad this is the only one that's available (as of today) on Amazon in the US.

Although I suppose you could enjoy Well Groomed on its own, I'd recommend finding the book, French Relations first. In FR, we meet the wonderful and impossible Tash French. Tash is (alternately) beautiful, ugly, graceful, klutzy, appealing, exasperating - well, you get the picture. In Well Groomed, we find her heading down the aisle with an equally lovable mess of a man. You love him, but you know he's not right for Tash. The book is very, very long, but it flies by. An added benefit of reading FR first is that you truly see the transition as one of the main characters changes from King Rat to Prince Charming (and we come to really believe that he had all that good in him all along - and that's really a feat!) More importantly, you see Tash develop into an assured and confident woman, making the right choices for the right reasons.	2002-02-04

I've read four of Fiona Walker's novels and truly liked three (French Relations, Well Groomed, and Snap Happy). To be honest, I had a very  hard time slogging through Kiss Chase. The basic premise is just too, too far fetched and I really doubt that anyone would actually act this way. I will admit that Walker redeems herself in the last 50 pages - too bad she couldn't have taken that care with the rest of the book.	2002-02-04

Snap Happy is more than the usual Chit Lit - grittier, more unsettling - but ultimately a happy experience. I've read three of Walker's books and she specializes in heroines that are less than perfect - full of faults. But they are also funny, warm, more like real people. Yes, she always incorporates a quite bit of fantasy - Juno has a stagnate day job and struggles to make it as a stand up comic. But, wait! Mum and Dad are famous in their own right, brother's girl friend is a fast and loose lingerie designer (but secretly a down-to-earth gal!) and there's quite an assortment of weirdos. I read the UK edition, so I'm not sure what changes they may have made in the US edition. In the version that I read, I found Jay to be a bit overdone (accent and diction-wise), but I'm sure that's how New Yorkers appear to the English. But, the story of Juno and Jay will hook you - you understand perfectly how they cross wires and you keep rooting for them to uncross them. I also love the fact that he loves the way she looks (extra lbs and all.) Walker does tend to go off the deep end with corny humor (and if you're not familiar with the song, &quot;Christmas on the Streets of New York&quot;, the extended comedy stint at the end may not make sense to you). Walker has written a few other novels - French Relations and Well Groomed are the &quot;pair&quot; (one follows the others, same characters) that I started with. I prefer them to Snap Happy, but I'd still recommend Snap Happy as a modern tale worth reading.	2002-02-04

However, Julia isn't as loveable as Fforde's other heriones. And that's OK, I suppose. You do wonder why Fergus persists to the end, how he could see the good that was buried under the surliness. While I didn't click as much with Julia as I have with other Fforde characters, I simply loved Fergus and once again the cast of supporting characters is a riot. And the whole idea of canal boats is so interesting to me as an American - sounds like to fun! Nobody turns a tale like Katie Fforde - be sure to check out her other books, especially Wild Designs and Living Dangerously.	2002-02-04

Let's get this straight - these aren't complex stories of love and redemption, with 550 pages of twists and turns. These are basically short, funny morality plays. I like how she tackles \\"nerdom\\" (or, anorak-dom, if you use the Brit term)and dares to make not one, but two, of the \\"romantic leads\\" out-and-out geeks (OK, good looking ones, and in the case of one of them, he can dance and kiss great, too.) I love her self-depracating humor and the fact that there's just not a lot of jet-setting going on here. The supporting cast of characters are brilliant - I can just see this as a movie. (And I know that's not exactly high praise for some authors, but I think it's appropriate here.) I read the UK version, I hope they haven't made it too American for the US market. I recommend this and Amanda's Wedding.	2002-02-04

But interestingly so. The primary and secondary characters are really fine, and start out promisingly (although the name \\"Daisy\\" for our heroine is too cutesy and doesn't fit her). At times, the dialog is fresh and funny. And, at times the secondary plots (Daisy's family, an orphaned boy, and drug dealing in a sleepy little town) are also promising, teasing the reader with the beginnings of a complex story that weaves suspense and wonderful romance (think Jennifer Crusie, Julie Garwood). But on all fronts, the story just falls flat. For every strong dialog exchange, there's another that's insipid and colorless. Daisy's family are just caricatures of blustering, \\"protective\\" men. All three (Dad and two brothers) have the makings of really funny and sweet protagonists (and we're promised the brothers stories, so we'll see)but they just pass in and out of scenes, making noise. The crime subplot NEVER takes off and doesn't make sense - it's almost an afterthought. I can't believe that there is a town in America (except in very strict religious communes, and this is supposed to take place in an East Coast resort town) where an unmarried woman of 30 would be in danger of losing any job because she MIGHT be having an affair with a 35-year-old single man. Perhaps Ms Woods is writing for an older audience than me (I'm 43)? Finally, I don't think she does enough of a job to convince me that Walker (our hero, who really does have all the makings of a wonderful hero - I'd love to see him in the hands of either of the aforementioned authors) has \\"seen the light\\". This is a man who has basically let his own flesh and blood sons leave his life (except 2 weeks a year)and he's going to take in his nephew? Aside from one passing reference late in the book, we get very little perspective on why his love for Daisy might be different than the love he felt for his ex-wife. I kept reading because I wanted to see how the book came out (hey, I paid good money and it wasn't total trash). Now here's the weird part - I do plan to buy the next book, to find out how Daisy's brother Bobby meets his match. See - I told you the characters had the makings of fine heros, let's hope that the rest of the story tightens up, or I may not make it to brother Tucker.

This book was actually recommended to me by Amazon.com (you know, that thing that pops up and tells you that \\"if you are ordering X book, you may like Y book?) when I ordered a Jennifer Crusie book.  I took a chance and ordered this novel by Jane Graves. Once I read the cover and scanned a few pages - I wasn't so sure. I'm glad I went ahead and read the book right off and didn't wait - it turned out to be a clever, fast-paced, and well written contemporary romance. You do have to suspend reality to accept the entire premise - realistically, I don't think John would have ever gotten himself involved with someone like Renee (or, at least Renee as she presented herself to him in that diner) but once you accept that fairy tale, the book just takes off. The characters are well written and the relationship between John and Renee is breathtaking - but rings true. John's family is very funny and adds a lot to the story - and that's where my problem is. I'm mad. Know why? Graves includes a sneak at her next book (not due out until Fall 2002!). In this one, she's apparently taking on John's older brother Alex, and I can't wait. I think I would have taken on brother Dave first - I can't imagine how we're going to come to love hot-headed, by-the-book-cop Alex! I hope we do get to meet all the clan one by one (sister Sandy too!!). Well done Ms. Graves!	2001-11-10

It's shorter than her recent books (written to that short, digestable romance format), so the characters aren't as well developed as you'll find in &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Tempation&quot;, &quot;Fast Women&quot;. But Crusie is such a solid writer (and was back then, too) she rises above the limiting format and delivers a solid, fast-paced, enjoyable tale. She has a gift for humor and believable, but witty, dialog. You do come to care for the characters.  I'd recommend this book!	2001-11-10

But c'mon folks - there's room in the world for lots of different books. This is a very charming, fun chick lit romp and it stands alone on its own merits nicely.

It's romance with a contemporary twist - and don't confuse that with \\"Contemporary Romance\\". Fast Women is another wonderful tale, full of witty, captivating, realistic, and intelligent dialog. And let's emphasize the intelligence of the writing in this book. Sure, the situation is a bit unrealistic (these little towns that Crusie creates are just too cute for words, two hunky PIs in said small town is a bit of a reach, all these women linking up with just so many losers in their early years is a bit sad) but she writes the plot in a way that you love - even if you have to suspend reality. The dialog is what makes this - and all Crusie books. It rings true. It's not the kind of thing that you'd be embarrassed to have your Significant Other pick up and start reading aloud in front of company - you won't cringe. She's also getting much better at her subplots - this one has a real mystery that you don't figure out in the first couple of pages. Another bonus - Fast Women's heroines aren't spring chickens or model perfect, but they're passionate and fiery. I've read and loved her other books - especially \\"Crazy for You\\" and \\"Tell Me Lies\\".  It's hard to find US contemporary romance authors that interest me. If you like British authors like Helen Fielding, Jill Mansell, Christina Jones, Katie Fford, and Jane Green, you'll like Crusie. Another winner - I can't wait for her next brand-new release, I hear it may be a continuation of some of the characters in Welcome to Temptation. Bring `em on, Jennifer!	2001-10-16

Like Nick from Heartbreaker, he's a terrific hero (Garwood always writes fabulous male characters). Michelle (aka Mike) is another strong heroine, playing a skilled surgeon who wants to stay in her small Louisiana hometown as a GP for the town folk. Like Heartbreaker, Mercy is also a suspense story - and a good one at that. Unlike Heartbreaker, you know who the bad guys are and what they are doing. Or, at least you think you do - Garwood pulls out some good surprises along the way, one in particular throws you. She's certainly not a Grishom, but she has come so far with her writing, Mercy is a real pleasure to read. And her skill at writing dialog has greatly improved, the character interactions really shine in Mercy. You know from the start that Theo and Mike will end up together, there's no secret there - Garwood keeps you engaged with the suspense plot and does a terrific job. Now here's my next request - we've come to know (and love/lust for) Noah in both Heartbreaker and Mercy. I realize he's not a Buchanan, but Julie can we finally meet the woman who will be his downfall? Hey - Theo and Nick have sisters, don't they?	2001-10-12

The subplots were always rather thin, with the romantic story holding the book together. Heartbreaker is the first contemporary book of Garwood's that I've read (and for all I know, her first contemporary book) and it's pretty darn good. As with her historical romances, she develops characters that are compelling - flawed, but lovable. And, as always, her male supporting characters are strong and move the story along (she doesn't do so well with female supporting characters, I might add). My gripe with Garwood has been that her dialog is occasionally insipid and flat, but there's some improvement here. (*Hint - her dialog gets much better in the sequel to this book, Mercy.) The good news? She does write a top notch mystery/suspense! This story moves along and keeps you guessing - it's really very good.  I'll be honest - early on I thought I figured out who the killer was, but then she threw me off the trail - I won't reveal who it finally was, though.  The action and pace were fabulous - although I'm not sure how accurate all the FBI stuff was (I'm not usually a suspense thriller reader) but it seemed plausible. Final verdict - read it, and then grab Mercy to continue the story of the wonderful Buchanan brothers.	2001-10-12
US	50725800	R2AX6PDIO8WC2L	0380796090	962133592	Watermelon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Watermelon is a Winner!	I really cant add anything to the rest of the reviews, but I have to add my praise. When you consider that this was Marian Keyes first novel, its all the more astounding. Funny, poignant, sexy  it has it all. Claire is a likeable heroine  shes not perfect, but shes not a real pain that you have to struggle to like (as is her little sister Rachel in the equally wonderful Rachels Holiday).  Claire stumbles around (and who wouldnt in her place?) but ultimately learns how to deal with life on her own (with her beautiful baby, despite what horrible sister Helen says!) The only marks of first novel are the men  James turns out to be a horrid, pathetic person and we dont really get any insight early on to this. Adam is a bit too, too, too good to be true  but thats OK. Keyes paints a more rounded picture of Claire, her sisters, and her mother. (In Lucy Sullivan and Rachels Holiday Keyes manages to round out all of her characters better, but the humor and romance gets darker than it is in Watermelon). All in all, Keyes turns out magnificent books  full of humor, quirky characters, and lessons about life. I highly recommend this book as a starting place  but dont stop here! I can hardly wait to read Last Chance Saloon.	2001-09-28

Overall, Stephanie Laurens is very, very good. She consistently turns out satisfying books, mixtures of some mystery and lots of romance. When both elements (mystery and romance) are \\"on\\", she can't be beat. When one element is \\"off\\", she's still pretty darn good. A few of her past books - Captain Jack's Woman (which was really a dry run for a Cynster novel), Devil's Bride, A Rogue's Proposal, and All About Love have hit both nails on the head. All About Passion is one of her very best romance stories - but the mystery/suspense story never really gets off the ground. It's blatantly obvious who the \\"villain\\" is and the pathetic red herrings that are thrown in mix into the story like chocolate sprinkles on a beer. On the other hand, I think she could have really used our boys (the Cynsters) more to round out the story. Devil plays a bit of a role and Harry (Demon) shows up on one scene, but that's it. As for the story between Chillingsworth (always one of my favorite minor characters in the Cynster novels) and Francesca - it's superb, one of the best in this series. Of course, his obsession about not falling in love is absurd, but you always have to suspend reality when you're reading in this genre. She's one of the best heroines in the series, too. As always, Laurens writes some of the steamiest copy around, but you get a feel for the personalities and character of both of the main characters. Overall, a pretty darn good read - probably could have used a bit more time in the writing process to make it perfect.	2001-09-18

It definitely transcends the genre of British Chick Lit (and dont get me wrong, Im a big CL fan). Its funny and witty and full of romance, but its also dark, shockingly painful, and full of realistic loneliness. Keyes masterful storytelling sucks you in  the books starts out breezy and full of laughs (even though we find Rachel, our protagonist, in the hospital after shes almost killed herself with an overdose). Her family whisks her out of New York City and back to Ireland, to rehab. The use of flashbacks can be tricky  in the hands of less adept writers, theyre jarring and annoying  but Keyes uses flashbacks to carefully reveal to us just what a horrible, horrible mess Rachel was. At the same time, you get inside Rachels head, and despite what a wretched mess she is, you start rooting for her. The supporting cast is perfect, and they evolve too  as you read, Luke moves from a macho caricature to a wonderful, sweet man (that the old Rachel truly didnt deserve!) But how many of us have had times in our lives when we felt about a wonderful guy the same way that the bad Rachel did about Luke  too caught up in what was supposed to be cool to notice the things that really matter. I especially found sister Helen to be a hoot  at first I didnt like her character, but by the end you see that she loves Rachel in her own way and wants her to be well.  Overall, you get much more than just a piece of lightweight fluff with Rachels Holiday, its funny and ultimately romantic, true. But its thought-provoking and inspirational, as well.   Id also recommend Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married but Rachels Holiday is in a class of its own. (Although I do have Watermelon in my stack of books to read  the story of Rachels big sister.)	2001-09-07

I didn't find the language in this book too modern, nor the sensibilities of the characters. Well, let me rephrase that - yes, these women were not accurately portrayed as women of that era. But I'm not particularly intersted in reading about women who have no control over their destiny, who have to submit to the men around them (who would be louts),and would end up dying in childbirth! In other words, I expect fiction to take some liberties. Having said that, I don't think that Joanna is too modern and Graeham is - well, wonderfully written. Joanna's strength, intelligence and passion make this a keeper - and be sure to read &quot;The Sun and the Moon&quot; (Joanna's brother's story) next.	2001-08-24

The secondary characters aren't as fleshed out as in later books, and the book suffers for it. Plus, I like the touch of suspense that Crusie adds to her later books - this is a straight romance.

I think Maddie and CL may be my favorite characters yet - Maddie's life is a mess, but she's pulls it out like a trooper. CL is the typical Crusie hero - big, strong, very (very!) ..., but funny and vulnerable too. He's the one who has been carrying the torch, not Maddie - a very nice twist on the typical book.

The small town setting is perfect, the entire cast of characters is a hoot, and the storytelling is wonderful. The realistic humor flies fast and furious. Unlike other readers, I don't have any problem imagining Sophie and Phin together forever - hey, this is fiction. If you can buy into the idea of such a perfect town, with such a perfect mayor (young, great-looking, intelligent, funny, unbelievable in bed, good father AND UNATTACHED?????) then you can believe that he's found his match in the whimsical Sophie. I'm glad my Mom gave me this to read - I'm now backtracking to her other books and reading \\"Crazy for You\\" and loving every minute of it.

Second Thyme Around (also published as Thyme Out) is truly a wonderful book. When the book opens, Peri has already grown from a sniveling little girl into a woman ready to be successful on her own, and perhaps even find love again after a disastrous marriage to a young businessman who left her for an older woman. She's settled in the country and is getting an organic specialty farm going, living close to her elderly friend, Kitty, who has been more of a mother to Peri than her own mother ever was. Imagine Peri's dismay when she walks into the kitchen of her largest client (a resort) to find a new chef - in the form of her ex-husband, who has somehow gone from businessman on the rise to hot stuff up-and-coming chef. Sparks start flying immediately between the two, and soon they are enmeshed in each other's personal and professional lives - including the filming of a national cooking series. What saves this from being a traditional and cliched romance is Fforde's extraordinary writing style and storytelling ability. The side stories are essential to the main story and you come to really know each of the characters. She infuses a gentle sense of irony and humor into the plot, but not to the point of distraction. It's a shame that you can't get all of her books in the US, but if you find anything by her - buy it!	2001-07-03

Get yourself a stack of books by authors like Katie Fforde, Christina Jones, Linda Taylor, Louise Bagshawe, Laura Zigman, Maeve Haran, Fiona Walker, Melissa Nathan, Jenny Colgan, and Victoria Corby. Heck, throw in the two \\"Bridget Jones\\" books (if you're one of the two people on the planet who haven't read them.) Then, start reading them one by one. In-between each of them, read a chapter of Tiffany Trott. It's a good palette cleanser. But it's not really a cogent novel, the plot is non-existent. You can tell it's derived from a weekly column, because it reads like one - definitely a modern day \\"Perils of Pauline\\". And that's OK - it's very witty, and at times I found it laugh out loud hysterical. But I didn't find it satisfying as a novel. If you want witty writing AND a coherent plot, look to the writers I list above. Especially Jenny Colgan and Victoria Corby, for their books are just so funny - and quick and light reads.

You have to suspend reason to enjoy these books - but once you do, you get a nice mystery. The culprit isn't that hard to figure out in this book - but you keep reading to find out why they did it and how &quot;Bess&quot; and her band of slueths gets it all worked out. One thing that I do believe Harper does do convincingly is how she portrays Elizabeth and Dudley. Of course, we'll never know what really went on, but it reads true to me. Worth reading.	2001-05-10

This time, I even had a hard time figuring out \\"who done it\\", which isn't always the case with her books. Once again Catherine, Edgar, and their children are on the road. First, to visit Catherine's old convent, then on to Germany to help Catherine's sister beat a murder charge. Her lovely, graceful sister has turned her back on devoutly Catholic Catherine and her Jewish family (it's a complicated tale - your best to start with the first book, Death Comes as Epiphany and go from there!), but Catherine still feels the pull of family ties. Now, sis has been charged with her bridegroom's murder and she has no one to defend her, except Juhan, a more-than-slightly dangerous knight. Meanwhile, it's a dangerous time to be Jewish in Europe, fanatical Christians are preaching vengeance against the Jews - and Catherine's father is feeling the pull of his birth, to return to his Jewish heritage. The complexities of the family that Catherine's sister has married into make solving the mystery a bit more tricky than other Newman books. In fact, while the mystery elements are always good, they are surpassed by the development of characters and relationships. What will become of Edgar's sister Margaret (who plays a big role here) - will she find the good match for bloodlines that her birth demands, or will her attachment to Solomon (Catherine's stoutly Jewish cousin) grow, and vice versa? Will Catherine keep getting pregnant every time she leaves Paris? Will Hubert really leave it all behind to live openly as a Jew and how will that affect his wife and children? This book develops these side characters - including Solomon, one of my personal favorites and Walter, a knight from their past on his way to the crusades. Stay tuned - I have a hunch that things will continue to be very interesting for our Catherine and Edgar!	2001-03-20

The road isn't smooth for any of them, but the lessons learned by all are wonderful. I highly recommend any book by Katie Fforde, especially Living Dangerously and Wild Designs.	2001-03-19

After meeting Catherine's eccentric family, we finally get to see where Edgar came from. All I can figure is that he indeed was the changling - because he's far too normal to be part of that motley band. Edgar, Catherine, baby James, Soloman (one of my favorites - we need to find him a nice Jewish girl!), and servant Willa travel to Scotland. Edgar has been summoned to help avenge the deaths of his two eldest brothers and 12-yr-old nephew. This family brings new definition to the term &quot;dysfunctional&quot;! Once again, Newman's dialog just clips along - very rich and believable. Her attention to period detail is just unmatched. I did figure out the mystery before the end - and I've done that with her books before - but she does add some breathtaking twists to the end, don't assume you've got the whole story nailed. All in all - this series is just wonderful. Unlike other series, it doesn't seem to be losing steam as each book comes out. Yes, Catherine is changing - but she is growing older and more mature, and we all change as we do that. I look forward to more, especially if Margaret (Edgar's baby sister) is going to play a bigger role. And what will we do with Soloman??	2001-03-16

The actual mystery plot equals - or even betters - the plot of Ms Thompson's first two books. It has a very nice twist - so if I were rating her outline, I'd give it 5 stars. However, we don't read outlines, do we? The dialog is weak and repetitive (same phrase or clich often appearing on the same page twice or repeated throughout the book), the character development is non-existent. Sarah (our sleuthing midwife) and Frank (NY Police detective) have known each other for several months - they are becoming friends (against their better judgements) and we need to see more of this. No, I'm not asking for full-blown romance (yet - although I suspect that's down the pike), since it has only been a few months - but we need to see more of their character. The character development in the first two books was wonderful - it just seems to go away here. And the other players in this mystery - yuck. You just don't get a feel for any of them, even the morphine-addicted mother who is a prime suspect. I suspect that Ms Thompson pretty much had the first two books written by the time she got a publisher to publish the first one - then she had to rush out the third, so she could get on a \\"once a year\\" schedule. We've seen that in other series, and the quality always suffers. It's a shame - this plot is a cracker jack mystery - but the book is really rather dull. I'll buy book #4 - but if it's like this one, I won't go for #5. Life is too short to read bad dialog!	2001-03-12

As one reviewer on Amazon.uk(giddily) put it - &quot;it's all about the shopping&quot;. Well, it sure is. And I got sick of it really, really quickly. It's not that I couldn't relate - I was like Rebecca once, making ends just barely meet from credit card bill to credit card bill. The story of a chronic shopper, who needs some direction and purpose (and self-control) is not a bad premise for this type of light romantic comedy. But I found it very hard to have any kind of sympathy or empathy for Rebecca at first. The story did start to move along and become more interesting about half way. Luke is prime romantic lead material and Rebecca actually DOES something besides shop. The supporting characters are amusing and just right for this kind of book... In other words - the story had the makings of a good one, but falls a bit short. Perhaps this is the editor's fault, not the author's. At the end of the book, I wasn't totally disappointed, but I didn't love it. If you are interested in British &quot;Chick Lit&quot;, you can do better. There's Jenny Colgan (Amanda's Wedding, Talking to Addison), Catherine Alliot, Christina Jones, Melissa Nathan,Robyn Sisman, and Fiona Walker. Having said all this - I think Ms Kinsella shows promise and I'd probably risk her next book.	2001-03-11

I guess the traditional elements of a romance are here, but the book seems just so much more than that. It starts with the death of Miranda's chronically unfaithful husband - and proceeds to show how the life and death of this selfish, ugly man(soul-wise, not physically) is like a pebble in a pool - the ripples of effect go on forever. There's pain and humor, and not all of the ends are neatly tied up - just the ones that matter the most to you at the end.

I don't understand the one star and two star ratings of this book by other reviewers - unless they just aren't fans of the genre and were forced to read this at gunpoint. I will admit that I agree with some of the others - nothing quite equals that first &quot;wow&quot; you got when you read the first Cynster book, Devil's Bride. As strong as all the Cynster guys are, they do pale in comparison to Devil. I think Phyllida holds up just fine to the rest of the Cynster wives. Yes, we have a formula going here - duh, it was set up in Devil's Bride. None of these guys are going to fall easily, but the bigger they are, the...well, you get the drift. In my opinion, this book has some features not found in the other books - 1)the subplot mystery is much,much stronger and cohesive than all of the other books (Devil's Bride was good, but the rest have been rather silly). Lauren's is showing growth as an overall writer. 2)I personally liked the fact that we went out of London and the ton for once - it's like a sexy Jane Austen book, with country folks and manners. 3)I agree with the other reviewer who noted the unique difference with Lucifer's proposal - it's about time! I had to write this review to come to the defense of the book. I didn't find it watered down or weak at all. But stay away if you want ballgowns and rides around the park (yawn). (And by the way, I loved Demon and Flick's story - Rogue's Proposal. Yes, it's a little,er, rougher than the others, but those two fit together so well. Of all, I found Gabriel's story the weakest, but the premise was something I found improbable. However, the love scenes were some of the best! See - always something to love in a Cynster novel.) I say, bring on Chillingsworth, the twins, and Tolly's little brother! In fact, with all of these baby boys, I see some Victorian novels just begging to be written!	2001-03-08

But I started this book yesterday evening and couldn't stop (darn, I have to work, but I did leave a bit early to finish it!) Really funny, cute - and despite what some might think, our heroine doesn't end up with the wrong man. Just one of the possible Mr. Rights. (Although, I do wonder how they make it all work out so everyone is comfortable. I know, I know, it's only fiction - but still, you always wonder how everything all works out.) Our Scots boys are full of charm, Mel is sloppy but sweet - and I actually liked Mookie the bridesmaid. Fran - well, I also wonder how that all works out. Anyway, the total cast of characters is so fun - annoying, but charming at the same time. Read this!!	2001-03-02

Fforde writes with such wit and gentle concern for people, you really come to care about the characters. The love story between Patrick and Althea seems genuine and you come away believing that they will live happily every after. The supporting characters are, as always with Fforde, strong and really make the book. Is this deep, heavy literature? No. But it's not all fluff either, and Fforde truly writes well.	2001-02-01

That's because Raymond and Julianna are, from the get-go, basically two good-hearted people, who are destined to love each other. There are some different angles to the book - Julianna is a widow with two girls, her first husband wasn't evil (although just about every other man in her past was), and although she's plenty strong-willed, she's not totally goat-headed like a lot of heroines are. Yes, Raymond is the classic hansom hero, but he's got an endearing personality too. (Plus, he doesn't get along with his parents - don't heroes usually admire their father and worship their sainted mothers?) Another interesting side to the book is Dodd's attempt to portray medieval England at least somewhat accurately - the lady of the castle still sleeps in the great hall (enough of these castles with all these private rooms!), walls take years to build, 11-year-old girls aren't considered far from marriageable (or worse), pagan rituals are still observed, even by pious Christians.  Some of the side characters are interesting and well-drawn (Kier just cries for his own book), others (Sir Hugh) aren't fleshed out enough to really understand. Love (the emotion) is very strong in this book, \\"love\\" (the physical act) is not as \\"fleshed out\\" (pun intended) as it is in other Dodd books. Overall, a great read because of the wonderful love story.	2001-01-30

A descendant of the Montgomery family (of the \\"Velvet\\" series by the same author), Jamie is the perfect hero, good looking and honorable. Too often this combination comes out rather smarmy, but he's not. Axia is wonderful heroine - full of spirit, ready to live life. But what makes this book special is the way the story is told. Not just through the eyes of the two main characters, but also through the perspective of the supporting characters. These people are interesting and wonderful in their own way. I too found the ending a bit rushed - not enough to really disappoint, but I would have liked to know more about what Jamie went through to eventually get to Axia, as well as how some of the other characters got to their final happiness.  Although there is some conflict, suspense, and danger, this book is not as wrenchingly intense as the \\"Velvet\\" series - I loved those books, but found myself worn out emotionally after each one.

But she - along with the supporting characters - all grow and learn quite a bit about what matters in life. Fforde has such a wonderful touch of humor in her books.

If you've read any, or all, of the \\"Velvet\\" series and want to know about baby brother Miles, you'll need to read this. The first 2/3 of the book rates 5 stars - but the last portion falls flat. As for the good part - we finally get to know Miles, who's been a bit of an enigma for the first three books. He's actually very young (I believe about 20) but complex.  My impression of him in the previous three books was that of a really smooth womanizer, with not much else to recommend him. Well, apparently, he is/was quite a womanizer, but that's his major (not fatal) flaw - just as his three brothers have flaws. He's not a bad guy - in many ways, he's nicer to Elizabeth than the others have been to their eventual wives. Elizabeth is not a simpering whiner (in my opinion) - she's pretty feisty and has a wonderfully soft heart, for someone who's had a crappy life. (Judith - book 1 - was abused by her dad too, but at least she had a mom to protect her.) Of course, the love story is just as passionate as you'd expect it to be, and the first part of the book features strong writing and story-telling. But things just derail at the end. I don't object to how she wraps the story up - in fact, I think the concept is excellent (I won't give it all away - but the women save the day). She just needed to take about 100 more pages to carry off the complex ending. In the process Miles strong personality just evaporates. And there's the very, very bizarre subplot (which plays a major role in setting up the finale) of Roger Chatsworth (yes, of the evil Chatsworths - Elizabeth is one too) and a woman. I actually welcomed an attempt to bring redemption to Roger, but it just doesn't work - it's almost creepy. The author did add a cute epilogue that lets you know how almost everyone turns out (no word on Jocelyn from \\"Velvet Promise\\" and \\"Velvet Song\\" or that nice Alan Fairfax who ended up helping Judith and Gavin in \\"Velvet Promise\\" - we'll assumethey lived happily ever after!) Ultimately - read this to wrap the series up, but it's not as strong as the others.	2000-12-11

This book (and the entire Velvet series) was written in the 80's, but I've just stumbled across it. I started with the 3rd book (Velvet Song) and my interest was piqued - I bought the other 3 to see how all the Montgomery brothers ended up. This one is a real keeper, a great love story. Judith and Gavin are right pig headed at times - and he does hit her early on, so if that bothers you (and it does me) be warned. However, the story is so well-written, the characters are so interesting. You understand the appeal, for instance, of Raine Montgomery in this book (it's not so clear in &quot;his&quot; book, Velvet Song - he's a sour guy in that one). The villians are great in this book, the heroes strong - what more could you want. I'm half way through Highland Velvet (Stephen's book) and it's just as good as this one!	2000-12-07

I picked this one up without reading the other &quot;Velvet&quot; stories - and went out and bought all three of the others based on the strength of this one. Yes, both of the main characters are flawed - Raine really has some issues in this one, you don't get too see the funny, playful guy he is in the first one (I'm 1/2 through that now). And Alyx has her issues too - but they both grow throughout the book, and by the end you know that they've come to accept their own limitations, as well as the limitations of their relationship.

I've just read, in rapid succession, \\"The Dangerous Gentleman\\" and \\"The Ruthless Charmer\\". I had very mixed feelings about the first book (yet couldn't put it down) - but I love TRC! In this novel, the heroine is the one who's a bit of a pain in the behind - she's just looking to misunderstand Julian. But she has her reasons, and ultimately they work it all out. The chemistry is good between Julian and Claudia, on all levels. The secondary characters and story line are very strong as well - unlike other reviewers, I'm glad to see a plot that hinges on something other than someone's lost treasure or some silly nonsensical mystery. This book dealt with some serious social issues, yet never detracted from the main story between the two characters. Ms London is a very strong writer, her technical skills are excellent. (Although, the dreaded clich \\"Rake with a capital R\\" does make an appearance!) I do puzzle about two things - the more I hear about the dear, departed Phillip, the more I wonder why anyone even cares if he's dead, much less let his death screw their own lives up so much. Secondly, how is it that Adrian (the \\"Dangerous Gentleman\\") is now the Regency equivalent of Cosby or Robert Young from Father Knows Best??? Only in fiction...I can't wait for Arthur's story!

I couldn't decide what to rate this book - it was a toss up between 1, 2, 3, or 4 stars. All I knew was that it wasn't 5, and I'll tell you why. First, what's good about the book: 1) It's very well written. I can't say enough good things about Ms. London's skill as a writer. I'm relatively new to the genre (it's been less than 9 months since I've read my first \\"romance\\"), and I've found some atrocious writing along the way. Even stories that I have enjoyed have been rife with poor editing, insipid dialog, poor grammar/sentence construction, and overworked clichs (\\"Rake with a capital \\"R\\" apparently is some sort of requirement to get published!) This book is truly well written. 2) The dialog is believable, if not authentic to Regency manner of speech. Conversations between characters ring true. Although the style of speech is a bit modern, it \\"works\\" - it doesn't feel as if you are listening to a conversation of today. 3) You do get a feel for what motivates the two main characters (Adrian and Lilliana) and how they became the people that they are. 4) The subplot, revolving around Adrian's birth, is a good one. I really didn't suspect what the truth was until it was revealed. Now, let's get to why I would never give this book 5 stars...basically Adrian is a jacka** through most of the book. I don't think I'm spoiling the end when I reveal that he does find \\"redemption\\" through Lilliana's love, you just gotta wonder if a year later, this guy is back to obsessing, brooding, seeking revenge, and emotionally abusing his wife and family. But this is fiction, right? We can believe he's seen the light and changed. I know it's a fairly common plot device to set the two protagonists up to be at odds for the majority of the book, but this is the first book I've read where the two characters are just truly hateful to each other - where the primary motivation to hurt the other person is just that, to hurt the other person. By the end of the book, Lilliana isn't much better. Ironically, the thing that Adrian does that really sets her off is the ONE thing he does that I can understand (I won't reveal what that is)! So, if this novel was so awful explain this to me - why did I start reading this at 10PM on a Saturday night and stopped at 2:30AM Sunday only when my husband stumbled out into the family room with this look on his face that said, \\"Get to bed, idiot!\\" I got up early to read a few chapters before I had to get everyone ready for church then rushed back home to finish the last few chapters before noon on Sunday - in other words, I couldn't put the book down. AND, although I had just placed a big order with Amazon a few days earlier, I went out on Sunday to buy the sequel, \\"The Ruthless Charmer\\" and by Monday AM, I've already made quite a dent on it. Go figure. My final analysis - if you don't mind the idea that the \\"hero\\" is anything but, if you don't mind reading about how two people who love each other can still work pretty hard at destroying each other - get this book. It's very well written and will certainly hold your interest - but it's not a pretty love story.	2000-11-20

I just finished this book in a bit over a day, while working more than 10 hours and taking care of the family - in other words, I stayed up really late! (And probably ignored my family more than I should!) Portia and Rufas have really dorky names but that's the only criticsm you'll get from me about this book. She's a great female character - she wants to be a soldier and goes out and does it! Rufas is a bit over the top with the revenge thing, but his reckoning at the end is totally believable. The plot is great, and the timeframe is one that isn't covered in many books - I get bored with the Regency &quot;ton&quot; and with circa-1100 war lords. I'm buying the next book in the series, can hardly wait to see what awaits Phoebe and Cato (who is a bit of a jerk in this book, so I wonder how he redeems himself!) Buy this book!	2000-11-09

And I rate them 2 stars because other Garwood books - The Wedding, Saving Grace, Gentle Warrior - are so much better than this. Part of the problem - Garwood tends to write in a very modern voice, with characters saying things that you and I would say today. Somehow, this works just fine with Scottish clans in 1100 - but it just doesn't &quot;click&quot; with Regency characters. Another problem - the non-romance plot gets muddied and rushed here, with characters thrown in to &quot;solve&quot; the mystery. The pirate plot could have been so much more successful. Both Lion's Lady and this book are very rushed at the end, trying to wrap things up. My recommendation - skip this and read Saving Grace instead!	2000-10-18

The non-romance plots are muddied and rushed, when they really had some potential. In this book in particular, the attention to dialog just isn't there. I could write better dialog and I'm no author!I'd recommend reading her Medieval/Scottish books - Saving Grace, The Wedding,etc. - they blend the right touch of interesting adventure plot, romance, strong characters, and humor.	2000-10-18

I really enjoyed that book and looked forward to the next two  books - By Possession is the first of the two, and is truly exceptional.  Ms. Hunter does her research on the period, so the political and social  backdrop is realistic. But more importantly, she creates characters that we  (as 21st century readers) can relate to, but are not 21st century people. I  know that sounds rather convoluted...I've read a lot of medievals in the  last few months, and many have characters that are quite contemporary.  Moira and Addis seem to be very much a product of their times - which means  you may not like how they act all the time (especially Addis), but it makes  for a more realistic story. I actually wondered (at points) how the book  would end - and lets face it, you rarely do have questions about how  romance stories are going to end, do you? Ultimately, the story was  incredibly powerful. Addis and Moira create such a synergy. I look forward  to the next book, By Design, where we get to see how things turn out for  Rhys, a character that was introduced in this book. This book is a great  read!	2000-09-18

You'd think I'd get tired of reading about these perfect (even their individual imperfections are really perfections  in disguise) men - but no! As with  most of the series, Our Man Cynster (in  this case, Rubert aka Gabriel) is bored with the life he's been living  (lots of money, lots of women, lots of fun) and is just ripe for the  picking - in this case, it's a mysterious countess that needs his help to  save her family from financial ruin. Although this plot device works on  some levels, it doesn't on other levels - thus 4 stars vs. 5. I mean this  is a Cynster male! They all have that second sense, can read women, detect  danger before it happens, etc, etc.  - and I'm supposed to believe Gabriel  doesn't figure out who the &quot;countess&quot; is, even when he's making  love to her? I don't think so! But the book redeems itself by painting two  of the best characters yet, especially Gabriel - he's supposedly the most  detached of all of them, in the end he seems the sweetest (so far). Alathea  is the usual strong willed, smart, self-reliant herione, but she's not  written as too much of a stereotype. For those of you who didn't care for  the steamier scenes in &quot;A Rogue's Proposal&quot; (I didn't mind them,  but it appears many did), &quot;A Secret Love&quot; is a notch or two tamer  than RP (or &quot;Scandal's Bride&quot;). It's fun to have some of the old  characters pop up - I understand that Laurens' is planning Chillingsworth's  romantic &quot;downfall&quot; in the future. And I'm quite sure we'll find  out some day how the twins meet their matches! Final verdict on &quot;A  Secret Love&quot; - buy it! And I'm waiting anxiously to find out how  Lucifer goes out in glory!	2000-07-09

Why laugh? Because I realized at the end that the murder that starts the sequence of events off is really unneccesary! Now  don't let me spoil the story for you with that comment, because it really  is quite a good book. The relationship between Thomas and Charlotte really  takes shape here - as much as they love each other, I always wondered how  they could both get over the differences in their pasts. They do, but this  book shows that it takes work and understanding. In the end, the mystery is  good (even if I'm still puzzled about it) and the character studies are  even better.	2000-06-28

SO...it's not a taxing read (great  literature) by any means, but I'm embarrassed by how much I enjoyed it.  Unlike others, I do find the chemistry totally believeable between the main  characters - and I liked the story very much. I'm a mystery lover, so I  will admit the mystery is a bit weak - however the rest of the story is a  terrific read.	2000-04-23

While not feminist per se, this book does a good job of showing  what few choices were open to women - regardless of class - 100 years ago.  Ms. Thompson does a better job with the mystery side of this story than she  did with her first Gaslight Mystery, the story has a good twist at the end,  yet is totally plausible. The developing subplot of the relationship  between Sarah and Malloy doesn't take away from the mystery, but provides  additional interest (for me!) I look forward to the next book - Ms.  Thompson drops some interesting hints at the end of the book!	2000-03-16
