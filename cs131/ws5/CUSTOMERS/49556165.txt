If there's certain kinds of books that must be consistently updated, it'd  be reference books, especially place references.  I keep this book near and  dear to my heart because it has great hikes, particularly ones that have  small campsites that once the day-hikers go home are quiet and nice.  But  thee lack of an update is glaring.  For example, the Table Rock (Molalla  River Valley one) hike has a poor description of how to get there, as rapid  growth in the Willamette Valley has changed the roads and towns on the way.   Also, the trailhead is now around three or so miles earlier, since the  road gave out in 1996.  I cannot group this book with the outdated trash  though, since it manages to capture a good idea, and also most books  overlook Table Rock, period.	2000-08-08

A creative writing intructor once told me &quot;You can only break the rules of writing if you do it properly.&quot;  I always imagine Robbins  as the kid in the back of the class muttering &quot;I'm gonna break all  your stinkin' rules, bud!&quot;  This book, he sticks it to the concept of  metaphor, and none too subtle.  But for a nonfan, I enjoyed this book.   Robbins is still an excellent story-spinner, and hits on immortality with a  bawdy hammer.  On that, I still recommend this book.  Be wary of hs styles  though (people who write in second person should be forced to read choose  your own adventures in hell).	2000-07-30

He wwraps you into it with intriguing characters (even the villans are interesting) and heavyweight concepts.  Smilla's is his most well-known work, and probably  his strongest for general audiences.  I read this coming off of  Borderliners though, and thee up-in-the-air ending among a few other things  made it seem diminished comparably.  But still one of the best out there  these days.  I recommend this as an introduction to Hoeg.  (Above all, do  not begin with History of Danish Dreams!)	2000-07-30

Not only is this book about commitment, it also is about being wrapped up in yourself, unable to accept that you aren't the only person with tastes.  I handed this book to someone I saw as similar to the protagonist, though  without sympathy or feelings for change, and he totally missed any hint of  that.  Aside from that taint, the book is excellent in satirizing us men's  inability to grow up and become rational mates.  Someday, ladies.	2000-07-30

Nabokov has an excellent command of the language, which in itself makes the book worth reading.  But the story  itself didn't live up to the hype.  I just didn't care what happened, and  this came dangerously close  to being one of those books one just never  finishes because of a lack of caring.	2000-07-30

People often wonder how they can teach their kids tough concepts, and hopefully, they'll gorow to understand them.  Here's a good example of an answer to that.  Orwell pokes at the Russian revolution with a nimble fork,  setting it as a fairy tale of animals that talk.

Steinbeck doesn't run along to long of a plotline, yet still fills a book with beauty.  It's the place that is the magic here, with the scenery taking the role of a  character all its own.  The mastery is revelaed when you realize that  you're soaking in the beauty of what is normally considered ugly: docks and  a cannery, the decaying  part of a town, the homeless camps...  But it all  seems like the greatest pllace on earth.  Steinbeck makes it seem like it's  not where you are, but how you look at it.	2000-07-30

I used to love King's horror as a child, but got sick of him around Gerald's Game.  Most of the stuff I'd read I regarded as fluff, no substance.  Except The Gunslinger.  I could not escape the power of Roland  of Gilead and his quest.  All the books have their high points, with the  original being at the top of my list.  I hold King with a grain of salt,  but these and Different Seasons still capture for me what literature is all  about.	2000-07-29

This is by far the greatest book in the King collection.  Most King fans back him for the horror, but here's the gold.  Two of these nuggets are stories that I have lined up to read to my kids someday, lessons on life.  First we have &quot;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot;, a  story of the lenghts of hope.  The other important one is &quot;The  Body&quot;, which through my attempts to be tough and steeled still brings  me to tears with how close it slices to memories of a not-too-far gone  childhood.  I implore anyone who has yet to thumb their way through these  to do so as soon as possible.  I only read Salinger more often than these.	2000-07-29

Oh, the greatest joy is having your instructor of syntax to be the one, the only Tom Givon.  I suppose for all the non-UO students, you must merely read his grand text, which we are discussing here.  To all who are getting  this for school, yes he even speaks this way.  In fact, it's stranger in  person because of his thick accent (born in Israel, raised in Spain).  But  don't get me wrong, he is at the top of his field for the subject, he just  needs to work on the delivery.  This is also chock full of examples, for  the proof-desiring.	2000-05-11
