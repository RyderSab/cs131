The guide literally has over 1,000 color photographs within its 312 pages. Naturally, the pictures are all on the small side, but they serve well as a visual aid so that one can get an idea of what one is going to see. The Florence section of the guide focuses on the city center, and is divided up by four areas: City Centre East, North, West, and the Oltrarno. In each section, the main sights are gone over and there is a street map and a drawn 3-D street layout of the area. In many cases, the main sights have cutaways and floorplans so that one knows exactly where one wants to go before hand. The main attractions of Florence are pretty much all within walking distance of each other, so sometimes the maps of each area are a bit confusing, and one has to flip to the street-by-street map at the end of the Florence section. This is somewhat disorienting, and I found myself not being able to find that street-by-street map since it is in the middle of the book, and it isn't convenient to put the either of the bookmarking flaps at that place.  The information on the main sights of Florence was quite good, especially the information on art and history. However, it was surprising that on the section devoted to the Palazzo Vecchio, there is no mention of the beautiful sculpture of Judith with the head of Holofernes by Donatello. The text was fairly engaging, and I found myself reading the whole guide through, even though we only went to Florence and Siena. The information in this guide about other places in Tuscany seemed fairly cursory; there are around 100 pages devoted to Florence, and another 100 to the rest of Tuscany. As far as practical information for travelers, I found the restaurant information to be good, but the hotel list isn't very extensive, and I did not use the guide to find a hotel.	2001-02-04

Lamb's Tales from Great Operas takes the name literally and is illustrated with all manner of absurd and comic ink drawings of muttons performing opera, to great effect. Arrowood's illustrations are fabulous, and Elliott always explains the scene each drawing derives from. We are introduced to seventeen operas: two from the 18th century, eleven from the 19th century, and four from the 20th century. The text is unfailingly charming, and would be suitable for both lovers of opera or the curious and sympathetic uninitiated.	2000-12-31

The cameras were made in the 1960s, are constructed entirely of plastic, and have a lack of focus at the edge of the image. The photographs taken by Lindbloom are all of Florence, but not a familiar Florence filled with commerce and people, Florence is strangely empty and ghostly in these photographs which feature much sculpture and architecture. The text does not go through the photographs to talk about what they are of and how they were taken, so they might make more sense if the viewer has been to Florence, though all the photographs are titled by location. There is a preface by Linda Pastan, an introduction by Ben Lifson, a &quot;Note on the Photographs&quot; by Eric Lindbloom himself, and a very informative afterword on the Diana camera by Italo Zannier.	2000-12-31

The prints are beautiful, and some of the best art in the world is featured. I especially love Rembrandt's Bathsheba (from the Louvre) and Reni's Cleopatra (from the Pitti, I just saw it during my stay in Florence). I do wish that the pages with the prints had the titles, artists, and locations of the works right there. Instead, the titles and artists are listed in an index at the end, and there is no mention of where these artworks are, so that if one is interested in seeing a painting or sculpture in real life, one can pursue this. But on the plus side, the book is easy to read, and very enjoyable visually.<br />The book is divided up by topic (subject or artist), these being: Fashions in Body Type, The Cult of Thinness, The Goodness of Zaftig, Eve, Venus, Other Goddesses, Women as Symbols and Personifications, Cleopatra, Bathsheba, Hilda, Rembrandt van Rijn, Pieter Paul Rubens, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Boris Kustodiev, Aristide Maillol, Gaston Lchaise, Reginald Marsh, Pablo Picasso, An Opulent Age, Opera Divas, The Stage, On the Beach, Youthful Plumpness, Motherhood, Confidently Voluptuous, and Women's Bodies in Other Cultures.<br />As an aside, which is more just a comment than a criticism: with all of its pictures celebrating size, it must be admitted that most of them are of fair, white women; women that have pale skin and women of &quot;other cultures&quot; are fit into the last chapter, and they are mostly other cultures through the European gaze (Italian, French, Swiss). While St. Paige argues that most people and most cultures have preferred heavier women to thin ones, can we also not argue that many people prefer paler people too, as evidenced by the images in the book. But I'm glad that there is an attempt to put people of colour in the book.<br />The author puts a lot of emphasis on the idea that women are naturally curvy, and that thinness is freakish. While I agree that women tend toward curviness, not all women can be a size 20 either, just like not everyone can be a size 2. And the argument of &quot;naturalness&quot; doesn't sit well with me, as it has been used to justify many unpleasant things. I am not a zaftig woman, but I appreciate the beauty on these pages.n the idea that women are naturally curvy, and that thinness is freakish.

I liked how Durham grouped the miracles by theme, and I find it interesting that he himself is not  Catholic. The quality of the illustrations is very good, and the depictions  of Mary are from all around the world, from old-master paintings  (Caravaggio, El Greco) to New World sculptures and paintings (including  work from Peru, Mexico, Canada). I do wish that the book had illustrations  of the things it spoke of, for example, at the point where The Black  Madonna of Czestochowa, Poland was discussed, I would have liked to have  had that image right there. However, I really did enjoy this book as it had  such a great collection of Marian images.	2000-07-27

Janis Tomlinson is very careful to point out the problems with the term  &quot;Spanish painting&quot; and tries to go beyond this idea, and to  discuss painting in Spain. She chooses to not discuss the Spanish born  Jusepe Ribera (as he was mostly active in Italy) but does look at painters  from France and Italy  who worked in Spain. Tomlinson also tries to get  away from stereotyped views of Spanish painting being only somber and  religious. I liked how the history of Spain and of Europe was tied into the  painting in Spain. The patrons of artists in Spain were also talked about,  what they wanted and how they reacted to different artists. Many painters  are discussed, even ones whose work is not often seen outside of Spain. The  book is has lots of illustrations, not only of paintings but of places.  There is also a handy map of Spain in the front of the book. The pictures  are naturally on the small side, since this book is rather small, and the  pictures rarely take up the whole page. Tomlinson is a good writer, the  book is quite readable and enjoyable.	2000-07-07

It is a bit sad that something so private has been made rather accessible, but it is good for lovers of  Kahlo's art. The book is inspiring; it is quite creatively stimulating with  the lush, free images and round scrawls in many colours. The introduction  by Carlos Fuentes is well-written, and I especially liked his description  of seeing Frida Kahlo at a Wagner opera. The essay by Sarah Lowe is  likewise good. The reproductions of the diary pages look very good and  clear (though since I haven't seen the originals, I'm just assuming they  are accurate), the size of the pages is large enough, and the colours are  all very vivid. The commentary is in a separate section from the diary  reproduction, which is nice because you can look uninterrupted at the diary  part, and not have to worry about what it all means. It does make for a lot  of flipping back and forth when reading the commentary and referring back  to the diary page, even though the page discussed is reproduced in black  and white (very small) in the commentary. The commentary is rather sparse,  and not all the pages of the diary are discussed. All in all a fascinating  read.	2000-07-05

The spelling modernization extends to place names as well as general terms.  I am not sure how I feel about spelling modernization, as it is nice to see  how the work was originally spelled, but it made the work very easy to  read. The play itself is amazing, very engaging even though it is a  history, and is mostly based on things that actually happened. The language  is not as flowery as Shakespeare, but is lovely nonetheless.  Some of the  characters of the play are very fickle, and seem to suddenly change as you  read the text of the play. (Queen Isabella goes from devoted and  self-sacrificing wife to cunning adulteress.) It makes more sense on stage,  and after seeing this play, it was easier to see how good it is.	2000-05-25

They are very interesting for those enchanted with Prague, as Rilke mentions many landmarks within the city (buildings, graveyards, and such that still exist), and the translator does  a very nice job footnoting all the locations mentioned. Both these stories  deal with the relationship between the Germans and the Czechs in Prague  when Rilke lived there, which is fascinating, since this is no longer the  situation at present. The stories are both romantic, but &lt;&lt;King  Bohush&gt;&gt; is the better one, being a more convincing picture of  reality and less muddled.	2000-03-08

This book has beautiful photographs of stained glass depicting various saints. The stained glass is from different time periods, from medival to present day and the photographs of them are of excellent quality. Most of the stained glass is from Britian, France, Germany, and Ireland. The book  goes through various saints, gives a summary of what we know about them,  shows a window depicting the saint, and maybe talks a bit about the window  itself. The book also deals with various events such as the Annuciation and  All Saints Day, and will show stained glass depicting these events. The  text is pretty concise, and very easy to read. My only big complaint this  book is that it is too short, and even some major saints are missing. It  would truly be a remarkable book if it was more exhaustive and if it went  into more detail about the stained glass windows shown.	2000-03-06

This is about more than communism, but about humanity. If you have read We, by Yvegeny Zamyatin, you really must read  1984. (I, for some reason, read them in that order) I would say that 1984  is the superior. Erich Fromm's afterword is worthwhile, additionally, it is  quite short and readable.	2000-01-28

The text is engrossing, and can be easily read in 1-2 weeks. Caravaggio's life and work are both dealt with very well by  Catherine Puglisi, and the writing is quite good. On the other hand, the  silvery text is pretty, but clearly not functional for people with less  than good sight. The book is also on the smallish side (Phaidon does not  seem to make the really huge books like Abbeville or Abrams).	2000-01-19

Janis Tomlinson, the writer of this book, seems primarily concerned in showing that there is a continuity in Goya's work, that it did not suddenly change from light-hearted to dark after Goya went deaf. For the most part,  I feel she achieved this end, I for one am convinced. I wish she wrote more  on Goya's technique and his personal life, both of which she does not go  into much. The 300 or so colour reproductions of Goya's work are excellent,  and there are many good close-ups. Unfortunately, Goya produced around  1,800 works, so it is disappointing that only a fraction of them are in  this book.	2000-01-18

We see Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and T.S. Eliot all through the eyes of Hemingway.  Hemingway's descriptions of Paris and of his writing process are often very  beautifully written and fascinating.  This book is a quick read, although  it does not have much narrative (which is fine, but if you are expecting a  plot, forget about it), and is somewhat disjointed.	2000-01-18

These short stories are gripping, I could hardly put the book down. They are nonsensical, but in a perfectly reasonable way, life is very odd, and in this way Murakami's work is reflective of our times.  If you read Wind  Up Bird Chronicle, and not this, then don't be surprised that the first  short story is pretty much the first chapter of that novel.	2000-01-12

Most of the stories are very short, &quot;The Casualty&quot; being the longest (40 pages in this edition). &quot;Vive La France&quot; gives a good description  of the passing of time, and is a tense, atmospheric story. &quot;Beside the  River&quot; is also especially good, the despair and hopelessness of the  story is almost tangible, and the switching of narrators is well done. All  in all, I was very impressed with these stories, and am surprised that they  are not more widely read.	2000-01-10

The way it portrays time passing is incredible, you feel as if you are experiencing a day in London after the first World War. The way Woolf shifts the narrative from one person to the next is done very  well. The book is very short in length, and is easier to read than Portrait  of the Artist as a Young Man, and is much shorter than Remembrances of  Things Past, so thus would be a nice introduction to stream of  consciousness writing.	2000-01-03

Albrecht D&uuml;rer was an incredible person and an amazing artist, and this book provides us with the chance to look into some of his thoughts.  The first half of the book consists of D&uuml;rer's letters to Wilibald Pirkheimer,  written while D&uuml;rer was in Venice (1506). These are fascinating, D&uuml;rer's  description of the Venetians and of his artwork completed during his  Venetian stay are especially of interest. The second half of this book is a  record of D&uuml;rer's journey to the Netherlands (1520-1521). It is quite dull  when he is merely recording how much money he has spent on what and where  he has eaten. But he does describe things such as the great procession of  Our Lady's Church in Antwerp, and he writes about his fears after Martin  Luther is taken prisoner, which makes having to read the dull bits worth  it.	1999-12-29

Having read both the Pope translation and the Lattimore translation of the Iliad, I really found the Lattimore one to be preferable.
