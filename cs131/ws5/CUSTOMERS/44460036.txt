This past year has brought \\"us\\" two outstanding books on this very subject. First is Joel Hardin's mammoth book \\"Tracker: Case files & Adventures of a Professional Mantracker\\" (which unfortunately is unavailable for purchase on Amazon, but may be obtained at Joel's website; [...]) and now Diaz's \\"Tracking: Signs of Man, Signs of Hope\\" both of which I highly recommend for the trackers professional library, whether you are military or civilian, track humans or animals.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of this book is a paralleling short story at the end of each (most) chapter about a Special Forces tracking team on tactical follow-up mission in Korea. The author uses this fictitious story to familiarize the reader with the employment of man-trackers and at points to illustrate the topics and learning's of the chapters covered. The story was interesting and somewhat entertaining but I do not know if it truly hit the mark, for what it was intended for, and I do not know if this will appeal to any other trackers other then military or Law enforcement trackers. I personally liked the concept but would have rather heard about his (Diaz) actual exploits and use of these techniques whether operationally or just in his training experience. I do not know how valid my compliant will be seen (by others and Diaz) as the whole of this book is based on his (Diaz) experience and knowledge of the subject.<br /><br />The meat and potatoes of this book are seven chapters. Starting with Chapter One, which covers tracking history and an overview of tracking to set the tempo of the book, over all it is done in a broad stroke of the brush, as stated it was brief coverage. Chapter Two gets into the details of getting into the \\"mind\\" of the quarry or as used in the book the \\"Chase\\". Chapter Three covers in detail how the senses are used in tracking and used to see and find \\"sign\\". It covers human sight, auditory tracking, scent tracking and finally tactile tracking. This chapter goes into detail often missed in other works but essentially in the end the same information is covered. Chapter Four begins to explain the substances that make up visual tracking, and what cues alert or ID \\"sign\\" to the tracker. Given detailed information about ground sign, middle sign and top sign. This section also covers gait and stride measurements of the quarry and finally factors affecting \\"signs\\", Diaz covers this in four broad factors; terrain, weather/climatic conditions, time, and human/animal disturbance. Chapter five covers aging. This is the cornerstone of tracking, and this is what separates the groupies from the rock stars. Also this is the hardest of all tracking subjects to put to paper (excluding Tom Brown's mythical and sometimes comical system of pressure releases). Diaz in this section covers flora and fauna as well as human and animal excrement in helping the ageing bracketing of sign. Something I have not seen covered in other tracking titles is the coverage Diaz gives to Forensic pathology in aging a corpse. Also in this chapter is detailed coverage of building and maintaining an aging stand or laboratory. Overall the reader gets a good foundation to start with and build on. Chapter Six covers detailed information for maintaining tracking records and logs, filling out tracking reports to help save and  disseminate information/intelligence. Also covered is information on determining quarry size, speed and direction of movement, morale and other factors. Details are given on search techniques and patterns, as well very detailed section on blood spoor and blood trailing. The finale chapter covers the tracking team employment, duties and structure, as well as tactics, immediate action drills, and track search procedures. This section also covers training techniques for the tracker and tracking team.<br /><br />The end matter is also detailed providing the reader with an epilogue, Tracker's Creed, five appendixes on various reports and logs, glossary, recommended reading which I felt was totally inadequate and incomplete (this is minor pet-peeve), and finally a very detailed index. Between the index and footnotes through out the book I feel Diaz more then made-up for his weak recommended reading list.<br /><br />The book is a hard cover (which will be available in soft cover also, ideal for field work) with full-color dust jacket. It is profusely illustrated with line drawings, charts, tables, color and B&W photography. The photography of the different \\"sign\\" ranges from super to useless, the later being less prevalent. Overall the photos are a great source for the novice providing detailed insight to the text. Page count is I-XIII pages of front matter, 242 pages of subject matter, forty pages of which is end matter.<br /><br />Overall all I found this book to very good with no major flaws, it covers details missed or ignored in most other titles and brings the reader sound knowledge from a reputable source. This book will not please all trackers but will bring a smile to the military and law enforcement tracker as for this book caters to them specifically, but the information is still of use to all trackers. Remember as with all tracking books the title is not meant to make you a master tracker but will help you along on your endeavor to becoming a competent tracker. Finally the information in this book will only be as good as your dedication and \\"dirt time\\".ed providing the reader with an epilogue, Tracker's Creed, five appendixes on various reports and logs, glossary, recommended reading which I felt was totally inadequate and incomplete (this is minor pet-peeve), and finally a very detailed index.

This book covers all the major topics and tactics. Starting with a brief background history, rolling into RSF's structure and command and control. Cover some of the methods to secure and control rural villages from terrorist incursions and intimidation, much like the techniques used in Malaya and Vietnam (hearts and minds to some extent). Discuses some of the Rhodesians methods to control their borders, from insurgent crossing and the employment of mines, which today they are still dealing with residue effects of these minefield.<br /><br />This book covers the intelligence apparatus in a counter-insurgency conflict in great detail, which worked successfully in Rhodesia. In particular their use of elite units (Selous Scouts and Rhodesian Special Air Service (SAS)) coupled with their intelligence network. The Rhodesians used and mastered a technique pioneered by the British in Kenya and Malaya known as Pseudo-terrorist operations. This technique accounted for more kills then any other method used and made the Selous Scouts world famous. The coverage in this book is unsurpassed and the most detailed I've read on it. For this alone the book is worth the price. The also has excellent chapter on external operations; taking the fight to the terrorist safe-haven and eliminating the threat at the source, much like what we need to do to the Taliban operating in Afghanistan and hiding in Pakistan. This is a most read book for all military leaders and Special Operations personnel. I can not recommend more!	2005-01-09

Covers the early history and background as well detailed chapter on Geronimo. It goes in to great detail of the daily living conditions and activates of the period from weapons employment, to cavalry tactics and pack train techniques using period reference material and military manuals. Has a superb chapter on the Apache and their employment by the Army, as guides, scouts and trackers and debunks some of myths of their capabilities. The book has extensive end matter (general and periodical bibliography, index as well one appendix). The appendix on uniforms is extensively plated with diagrams and templates of specifications and standards of uniform fabrication, ideal information for reenactors and historians of the period.

I guess I thought I was going to do some close-quarters combatives on Taliban/Al-Qaeda vermin with the final blow eliminating the threat and ending it with the \\"trophy\\" scalping. Needles to say I did not ever scalp any one... or really ever planned to. But I now owned this Tomahawk and need something to do with it.<br />My intentions when purchasing this Tomahawk, was due to the history I knew of the weapon being used by Rangers (Rogers Rangers from the Colonel days mid 1700s) up to Vietnam and on into Iraq/Afghanistan by other units. Incidentally the VTAC was modeled after the style used by rangers in Vietnam. So knowing its historical use I decided I would give it a whirl and replace my \\"bowie knife\\" with it that I had carried on my kit.<br />So as I started to say I came across this book online as I order my Tomahawk, I bought the book not with the intention of learning how to wield this thing in combat but to read something with information on the historical background and history of the Tomahawk in combat. This book did just that the author went into painstaking detail to fit into this book whenever possible background information and historical material to authenticate his points on various aspects of this weapon in combat and training. The book primarily deals with early history of the weapon (17th and 18th century) and its employment in that timeframe. The book lays down a historically correct training regime of the axe, which is still applicable today for anyone, whishing to learn the art of using such a weapon. The author also covers in great detail the use of the \\"long knife\\" in conjunction with the tomahawk.<br />Over all the book met my expectations and was a quite enjoyable read, and I actually learned some interesting tips and techniques on the tomahawks use. The books layout is also enjoyable, with superb illustrated grayscale sketches that appear on practically every page, and are quite easily understandable for the martial artists stand point, providing step-by-step detailed instruction on every drill and move. Just superbly done.<br />I do not ever imagine myself using my Tomahawk on anyone in combat but I now always have it on hand even if it is just to open ammo crates or bust through doors. If anyone reading this is thinking of buying a Tomahawk, look up the company \\"American Tomahawk\\" they simple make the best and with it buy this book! I look forward to reading the author's first book.nd techniques on the tomahawks use.

This book covers the periods from WWII with high lights about the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, forerunner to the CIA and Green Berets) onto Korea covering air missions on psychological operations and support efforts, rolling into the late 50s early 60s coving various clandestine and covert operations, like the \\"Bay of Pigs\\". Haas then picks up with the 2nd Indochina war starting in the early 60s with Laos wrapping it up the Vietnam section with the Son Tay Raid. This book also covers Medal of Honor winners and other heroes and personalities of Air Force special operations. The book has an index and bibliography.<br /><br />I rated this book 4 instead 5 stars for one reason. There are to versions of this book both soft cover, but the problem lays in that one version is printed in full color on high quality glossy pages and the other completely in black & white on low end paper, both soft covers are the same quality. This book being primarily and illustrated history with pictures, illustrations, charts and diagrams on practically every page it looses a lot of its luster in B&W. I guess if you never seen the color version it would not matter but I own both, because I borrowed a copy (color version) from a friend and liked it enough to add it to my library, I ordered the book on line an got the B&W version, so I went on the hunt and found another copy in color (FYI: Air University Press, Alabama, 1997 printed the color edition), big pain in the but and costly! Over all I highly recommend this book in ANY version it is truly a landmark edition to US Air Force Special Operation and American Spec Ops in general. Great Job Haas!	2004-12-22

Some of the underground \\"sanctuaries\\" covered are primitive caves (Natural and man-made), water irrigation systems/wells (Karez), hides, caches and on to highly complex underground dwellings like Zawhar Kili, located three miles from the Pakistan border, which are underground villages, complete with repair shops, public relations office, garage and hotel for visiting journalists. This book goes into detailed tactics employed by the U.S. military ground forces, much of it very remnant of what the Tunnel Rats used against the Viet Cong and looks back at what the Russians failed to do 25 years ago: flush out, hunt and kill the enemy. The book also goes into detail on many of the modern weapons being employed currently to reduce the Taliban and al Qaeda's hideouts to rubble. The book is highly illustrated with diagrams, maps and photos, although the photo quality at times are not that good and very grainy. This book is highly recommended for any Grunt heading over to Afghanistan for a crash course in tunnel warfare. Overall it may not be a great book but then again there is no other title out there on the subject. Bottom line, this is not a full blown academic review; however this book will make any old NAM Tunnel Rat out their proud to see their heritage continue!	2004-12-19

I have bought so many books that have been reprinted and re-titled and it just fires me up. So be aware so you do not waste unnecessary money like I did. As for the content, the book is declassified training notes, outlines and instruction in the many facets of secret warfare. Some of the subjects are;<br /><br />Irregular Warfare<br /><br />Disguise Techniques<br /><br />Surveillance<br /><br />Agent recruiting<br /><br />Burglary<br /><br />Interrogation<br /><br />Agent Covers<br /><br />Agent Cell organization<br /><br />Resistance<br /><br />Subversion<br /><br />Sabotage<br /><br />Propaganda<br /><br />Codes And Ciphers<br /><br />Secret Inks<br /><br />Fieldcraft and Tracking<br /><br />Demolitions<br /><br />Hand-to-Hand Combat<br /><br />Weapons Training<br /><br />Physical Training<br /><br />This is just a sample of the material covered. This book is ideal for researches, historians and military enthusiasts. This is the same program of instruction that the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner to the CIA and Green Berets) was trained with at Camp-X in Canada. Great historical source.	2004-12-15

In the counter-insurgency / low-intensity conflict arena there are many valuable lessons to be learned from this text, and for the armchair historian or casual reader the story is still gripping enough to keep you enthralled to the last page. Basically this is story of the birth and death of one of the most feared insurgency units of the time, as told by the founder of this outstanding unit; Ron Reid-Daly. It covers the units training, selection, operations, and personalities of the unit with the war being the tool that propels the story and evolution of the unit. One of the most remarkable aspects of Selous Scouts was their employment of pseudo-terrorist techniques, which were used to melt into know terrorist cells, to either eliminate the terrorist themselves or direct other assets to the known cells to be neutralized. While conducting these type operations the Selous Scouts maintained the cover of being a combat tracking (mantracking) unit, as to keep their true purpose under wraps from the rest of the Rhodesian Security Forces. I would also like to point out they were truly all trained trackers and maintained this capability to superb levels of proficiency. This book has been re-release as \\"Pamwe Chete - The Legend of the Selous Scouts\\" by Reid-Daly and is a completely revamped version of \\"SELOUS SCOUTS - Top Secret War\\" (original title). If you have read the original edition you will enjoy this one much better. Many areas in the book have been rewritten and their are many additions and details added to the text. Many of the names of individual have been added into this text, originally kept exempt for security and safety reasons in this version. Also there are many new photographs added and the Illustrations are a lot crisper. One of the biggest treats in the new edition is the added appendix covering; roll of honor, wing nominal roll, awards and citations. This version truly opens the door to this once `Top Secret\\" organization of combat trackers turned pseudo-terrorist specialist. Bottom line BOTH versions are GREAT reads!nor, wing nominal roll, awards and citations. This version truly opens the door to this once `Top Secret\\" organization of combat trackers turned pseudo-terrorist specialist. Bottom line BOTH versions are GREAT reads!	2004-12-04

The book has a UK/Land rover slant but all the topics covered are relevant with whatever platform you plan to operate from, and whether it is for recreational or military purposes. This is the companion piece to Toms other book which I also highly recommend, \\"Vehicle Dependent Expedition Guide\\". Both books are long out of print but can be had through used book deals, also \\"Desert Expeditions\\" can be downloaded for free at [...] if you do not mind the format.

The book is authored by the world famous founding commander of the Selous Scouts, Rhodesia's elite combat trackers and pseudo-terrorist unit. Reid-Daly (also authored \\"Pamwe Chete - The Legend Of The Selous Scouts\\") shares extensive bushcraft secrets taken from years of operational experience in the Rhodesian \\"Bush War\\". This book was the brainchild of Al Venter (Author of \\"The Chopper Boys: Helicopter Warfare In Africa\\" and \\"War In Angola\\") who saw a need for a book on survival geared to the Southern African scene. Other experts who assisted with this book was, Brian Robinson former commanding officer of the Rhodesian SAS and a founding member of the Rhodesian Tracking and Bush Survival School and John Ashburner former tracking instructor from the Selous Scouts, who made a major contribution to the tracking and bushcraft section of the book. The \\"Staying Alive\\" covers all the typical skills associated with this type of book but shines in certain sections. For example the section on water explains how to locate indigenous water bearing plants, methods that can only be applied in that location of the world. The food section information on local plants is extensive as well as the information on edible game. A high light of the section is the information on parboiling as well as cooking and consumption of rotten meat (Any one familiar with the Selous Scouts selection process is familiar with this technique. During the selection course the scouts were given a baboon to kill but were not allowed to eat or quarter it, it was hung out for all to see, as the days went on the scouts were not allowed to eat, then after a week or so, the scouts were given the rotten carcass to eat, after proper instruction on handling and cooking the rotten meat.). The medical and navigation section also have extensive information on local factors to take into account. Finally I think the high light of this book is the tracking section which covers animal tracking and human tracking the later being prevalent. This section is as close as one will get to the tracking skills employed by the Rhodesian Security Forces. The section is basically a revamped military program of instruction. I cannot say enough about this section of the book, other then outstanding. The book is heavily illustrated with quality line drawings.

Superb look into the primitive world of Australia's legendary hunter/trackers, the Aborigines. This book is an oversized soft cover made with quality paper. The book is heavily illustrated with line drawings, B&W and color photography, with the later being prevalent. This book goes into great detail describing the lifestyle of these Bushmen (Pre and post contact with Europeans). It covers a substantial amount of information about the art of tracking, primarily how it is a body of various skills and knowledge (botany, primitive navigation, and understanding animal behavior, to name but a few skills). I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in culture, nature, and in particular tracking. I do have to say it is a very hard title to find, I ordered it three or four times with no luck (And it is listed as a obtainable title, so beware!), finally I had to purchase it through a used book dealer at more then double its cost.

This is the first time in history that Special Forces are responsible for winning a conventional war with a few hundred operators and in less then forty-nine days they put an end to the Taliban regime with the fall of Kandahar. Book covers that story in word and pictures. All major operations and high lights of selected missions are covered. Book details all the major and minor coalition SOF units from Australia (SAS), New Zealand (SAS), Turkey (Special Forces), Danish (Commando), Norwegian (Commando and Rangers), German (KSK), French (SSAG), and Canada (JTF-2), as well as American SOF. That is just some of the countries and units covered. The book does not forget anyone I can see, they have also sections on CIA commandos, Search and Rescue units, Psy-ops and civil affairs The book explains the unit function/organization and its participation in STAN. Now what makes this book better then other titles on Special Forces, well for one this title focus on Afghanistan and the units operating their giving this book much more focus, now I must also say this book is not meant to be an exhausted historical text but a detailed synopsis of the events in STAN. The books winning point are the illustrations and color photos, there are literally hundreds. Most are unpublished but I did notice a handful you can easy find online, but this in no way takes away from the book for the other photos make up for them few. Another interesting feature is the book has numerous reenactment photos of operators in full kit, displaying gear and weapons used by each unit. This would be ideal for collectors, gear-nuts, historians, air-softer and as already said reactors. The photos are generally studio shots of models wearing a particular countries kit and weapons, with multiple angles with text descriptions. I must say that these portions of the books photos are superb. The book has its flaws, some pictures are described wrong as well as some of the finer points of selected units but as a whole for what the book was intended for it did quite a good job and I highly recommend it to anyone one seeking information on the elite units that fought in STAN, and as a final not some of the units covered here I have never seen in print else were. This is by far one of Eric Micheletti best work to date.g as well as some of the finer points of selected units but as a whole for what the book was intended for it did quite a good job and I highly recommend it to anyone one seeking information on the elite units that fought in STAN, and as a final not some of the units covered here I have never seen in print else were.

This is the only book you will ever need for desert survival in any desert around the globe. It covers introductions to the world's deserts, with emphasis on North American deserts. The book covers general skills pertaining to desert survival (Water, shelter, food, navigation etc.) and also has sections on desert hiking, biking and photography that were good for the novice and refresher for the expert. The chapter on desert transportation was excellent and a subject often over looked in similar titles. Over all I found the book to be quite good for the novice hiker to experienced desert dwellers like extreme adventures and military types.	2003-08-15

This book is the amazing story/history of the LRDG, a WWII special forces unit that would probe the desert waste lands to conduct reconnaissance, pathfinding missions, mapping and survey ops as well as limited direct action missions, against Italian targets of opportunity. The unit also ferried the SAS into operations. This book is fabulously written and structured makes the read quite fast and easy. This story covers the LRDG birth in the desert as long-range patrol unit to the LRDG. It covers the personalities, evolution of the unit; operations, equipment and an inside look at many of the tactics and procedures employed at that time for mobility operations. Excellent book if you would like to see the roots of modern special operations. Well worth the read.	2003-06-17

The book only traces back the historical trail of these resent events to just prior to Desert Shield/Storm and does not go into detail of prior \\"blowback\\" to the current situation in the gulf. The book goes into some overview on WMD with emphases on chemicals/biological and the SCUD delivery system. Also all the major weapons, equipment and tactics of the Iraqi/U.S. possible upcoming land and Air campaigns are covered.

This book is formatted and laid out like his previous title \\"Hostage Rescue Manual\\". For the size of the book it covers a broad subject coving everything from Guerrilla theories to small unit operations. The book contains many sidebars of historical examples and in-depth author comments, which highlight and authenticate the subject matter. The book is profusely illustrated and contains many B&W photos, many of which are unpublished Rhodesian bush war era photos (which alone make the book worth the buy) and other relevant photos. Some of the subjects covered in the book include psychological operations, hearts and minds, Ambushes, booby-traps, combat tracking and pseudo-guerrilla operations. One of my favorite chapters is \\"Trackers and Pseudo-Guerrillas\\", which includes extensive tips on tracking as used by David Scott-Donelan in Rhodesia and South African bush wars. It also goes into the Pseudo-operation concept and how it is used as formidable weapon in a low intensity conflict. This is the concept made famous by the Selous Scouts in Rhodesia, which accounted for more dead terrorist then any other unit in the war. Over all, the book is a good reference, but only covers the surface of most subjects. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a interest in special operations, with most of the skills discussed in this book being the bread and butter of most of the worlds special forces that still employ these tactics all over the world (much like how the Green Berets are operating in Afghanistan presently).	2002-11-23

I was lucky enough to have bought this book used in mint condition for a very small amount of money. I cannot believe this title is selling for as much as it is to collectors. The book is excellent, but the same material can be found elsewhere for a lot less. I will give a breakdown of each chapter, which there is, only five of:<br /><br />Chapter One - History Behind The History. This part is a background and discussion of terminology and its history. This chapter also briefly covers over the major clans. It sets the pace for the rest of the book. A good alternate to this is Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi book \\"Ninjutsu - History And Tradition\\", which covers the same in greater detail.<br /><br />Chapter Two - Religious And Spiritual Influences. This small chapter covers overviews of Hinto, the original faith of the Japanese people. As well as Buddhism and how it filtered into other spiritual aspects of the warrior breeds. A book with much of the same type of topic information is Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi book \\"Essence of Ninjutsu\\".<br /><br />Chapter Three - Ninja Combat Tools. I was a little disappointed in this chapter it only discussed two items. The Bojutsu (six foot staff) and Kunai (a casual banged out piece of iron, in the somewhat form of a blade or tool edge), Hayes went into great detail of both items techniques and employment. I was hoping to read more information on other tools and weapons but the book did not come through. I am not going to recommend a book on the staff because the titles are vast, but I will recommend a few titles on ninja weapons. Hayes book \\"The Ninja and their Secret Fighting Art\\", \\"Traditional Ninja Weapons\\" by Charles Daniel and \\"Exotic Weapons of the Ninja\\" by Campbell.<br /><br />Chapter Four - Ninja Espionage Networks. This area covers traditional techniques used to get close in to targets, with the use of disguise, theatrics and other forms concealment of one's true identity and purpose. Again this is one of the Hallmarks of the Ninja and Hayes uses a mere nine pages of text on this subject. A good alternate to this is \\"Ninja the Invisible Assassin\\" by Adams and again Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi book \\"Ninjutsu - History And Tradition\\".<br /><br />Chapter Five - Ninja Guerrilla Warfare Techniques. I do not know where he came up with this title for this chapter. He covers this chapter in four pages of text, which goes into a hand full of ruses and stratagems. I found nothing unusual or different from other works here again a better alternate is Sun Tzu \\"Art of War\\" and \\"Ninja the Invisible Assassin\\" by Adams and again Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi book \\"Ninjutsu - History and Tradition\\".<br /><br />This title had no end matter (bibliography, glossary, and index). The book is heavily illustrated one of its high lights. The illustrations and B&W photos were clear.<br /><br />As a final note, the book overall is good and ideal for novices of the study. This is and old title, which I am sure, was ahead of its time when published, but now many books have come out (as I already listed above) that cover this material much better then Hayes work here. I noted to myself after receiving and reading this book, realizing why he (Hayes) has not reprinted this title, sadly it is definitely not one of his best works.on this subject.

I been serving in special operations capable and special operations units for 14 years, and my parents had no clue what I did (I think they thought I drove a tank or something) and when they became glue to the TV and heard all this stuff about SF, I began to get the phone calls (by this time I was well away from home), so I had this sent to my parents. This book was my final attempt to show them the light. This book did it, it made them armchair spec op specialist. They now know the difference from SEALs and Green Berets, and that Special Forces are Green Berets, and that the berets are just the headgear they wear. They also know that the Army are not Rangers because they stole the Black berets. They also got a history lesson from WWII to Afghanistan. They just loved the book and I still here about it. Now I finally got some respect from them!! Anyone who needs a crash course in SPEC OPS this book is for you.	2002-06-15

I know when I bough the book it would have a good portion dedicated to navigation, but why not call the book Navigation and Tracking or take tracking out of the title.

Not Just DELTA!<br />This book is a very good reference on some of the newer weapons and equipment in service in the US military (NOT necessarily the newest stuff!). The book states that it did not use any pictures of actual Delta Operators but other Special Forces operators for all the photos. As for the equipment its mostly main stream gear used by SOF, which has also filtered down to the conventional military; like the M4 Sopmod kits and all the components, off the shelf tactical gear from company's like Blackhawk, and the dinosaur PSN-11 (real cutting edge!!). The book is an excellent crash course on the stuff being employed by US troops in Afghanistan, but just do not let the title fool you, you will not find no secret delta patents here or uncover any national secrets.	2002-06-15

This book is an incredible look inside the United States' most secretive/covert unit (incidentally they still refuse to admit its existence!) in the military, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-DELTA. This book provides all the background data Beckwith's book (Delta Force) does not cover, plus a lot more in-depth outline and descriptions of Delta selection and advanced training events (Operator Training Course). I found this to be one of the highlights. The book also goes in to first person detail of many operations conducted by Haney while serving in Delta, his insight and participation in these events gives a refreshing look at some of the more know escapades the unit has been involved with like, \\"Desert One\\" were he barely escaped with his life. The book also coves little know topics of Delta's operation and employment in Beirut, Grenada, and Honduras, which I found to be quite reveling and intriguing. I must let you know the book does not disclose any national secrets most of the information is over ten years old (as Haney retired from active duty in 1990.), but this work is probably the most current information one will find on this organization.

US	44460036	RJ16BTUBB8QA1	186508297X	744931470	Sleeping With Your Ears Open: On Patrol With the Australian Sas	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	This Book Puts YOU on POINT!!!	As the author states in the beginning of this book, it is not a historical account or individual memoir. Instead, it is a journey into the nucleus of the SAS. The PATROL is the tool used to propel this account, which is the basic SAS fighting element of six operators. This book takes you through selection and training of patrol members, preparation and execution of patrols in Borneo, New Guinea, and Vietnam. This book spares no detail of operational patrols, from the warning order to mission debrief, it is all covered here. The book reads more like a how-to book highlighted with actual accounts of mission debriefs, this is just a treasure of lessons learned, that still apply today. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the SAS, or anyone that is in the military field Reconnaissance, scouting, sniping or special operations.	2002-04-07

The two scrolls were (translated) \\"Terrain\\" and the second was \\"Nine Grounds\\". Today the out come of all major conflicts are determined with a list of various factors one of those being geography. Knowing the \\"lay of the land\\" is a major asset to a tactician, knowing the \\"land\\" enables a planner to estimate probably courses of actions the enemy may take and how he may counter this move while using all available assets to his advantage, like the local geography. This includes every element from the weather, season, night, day, terrain, and that is to name but a few. The book covers topics from sea states to atmosphere as well as outer space and moon conditions. The book uses historical events to promote the topic by illustrating the events outcome due to some overlooked or advantages geographical condition. This book is not just for some planning officer at corps level but is an awesome primer for squad leaders and specialty troops like scouts, snipers and Special Forces operators. The book is also quite a good read for the armchair historian. The content of the book is put together excellent, the text, illustrations, and pictures are crisp and clear. The book is also oversized which makes it easier to read and handle. As a final not if you own this book, or like this topic I also recommend; \\"Battling The Elements\\" by Harold A.

It would have been nice to have known this prior to my purchase, but the company failed to give an accurate description of the content or in particular that the content is a reissue of prior titles. This is the second time (U.S. Special Forces, this title had three older tiltes also; Airborne Rangers, U.S. Navy SEALs, and again DELTA, which now I have this title three times.)

You do not finish this book thinking these guys are supermen, but humans.

Currently the military tracking program only entails visual trackers without argumentation from scent dogs, this is complete 180 from the mid-seventies when the Army maintained dedicated tracker team with visual and scent tracker capabilities. The military still utilize search (scent) dogs but the handlers are no longer given any instruction in the visual art of tracking. I believe that the use of dogs used with visual trackers is an excellent tool (not in all tactical scenarios) and it provides, both the dog and tracker to work to their fullest potential by complementing each other skills and attributes. Basically the dog can only follow a specific scent on the ground or in the air, but cannot read signs left behind by the \\"quarry\\". This is were the visual tracker comes in; he is trained to judge sign through reduction and deduction, obtaining valuable information from the sign. With this book it will introduce the pair and explain some of the misconceptions and expectations of both. It also covers skills, tactics and management for employment of both in a SAR environment. For its small size there is lot of information, what I really liked in particular was the end book matter; glossary, appendix, and index. All were very useful an in-depth. For a finale note this is geared toward SAR (search and rescue) but most of the information carries over to the tactical tracker, which by the way can be used in a CSAR (combat search and rescue) operation. Well worth the buy!	2001-06-28

In the counter-insurgency / low-intensity conflict arena there are many valuable lessons to be learned from this text, and for the armchair historian or casual reader the story is still gripping enough to keep you enthralled to the last page. Basically this is story of the birth and death of one of the most feared insurgency units of the time, as told by the founder of this outstanding unit; Ron Reid-Daly. It covers the units training, selection, operations, and personalities of the unit with the war being the tool that propels the story and evolution of the unit. One of the most remarkable aspects of Selous scouts was their employment of pseudo-terrorist techniques, which were used to melt into know terrorist cells, to either eliminate the terrorist themselves or direct other assets to the known cells to be neutralized. While conducting these type operations the Selous Scouts maintained the cover of being a combat tracking (mantracking) unit, as to keep their true purpose under wraps from the rest of the Rhodesian Security Forces. I would also like to point out they were truly all trained tracks and maintained this capability to superb levels of proficiency. This book is a re-release and completely revamped version of \\"SELOUS SCOUTS - Top Secret War\\" (original title). If you read the original edition you will enjoy this one much better. Many areas in the book have been rewritten and their many additions and details added to the text. Many of the names of individual have added into this text, originally kept exempt for security and safety reasons. Also there are many new photographs added and the Illustrations are a lot crisper. One of the biggest treats in this edition is the added appendix covering; roll of honor, wing nominal roll, awards and citations. Bottom line is this version truly opens the door to this once `Top Secret\\" organization of combat trackers turned pseudo-terrorist specialist.`Top Secret\\" organization of combat trackers turned pseudo-terrorist specialist.	2001-06-25

In his explanations and discussion of tracking Mr. Liebenberg touches on and covers a wide range and field of topics; botany, zoology, anthropology, paleontology, and archaeology to name but a few areas. He explains his theories that the art of tracking may present a crucial step in the transition of early man to modern man. His work is not only backed up by his years of tracking and research but also by his many years of studying and living with primitive tribes; like the Kalahari hunters.  I found this book to be the definitive text on tracking; this book puts all the other works of tracking into perspective and provides added insight to this science. The book in its presentation is geared toward the Africa but as we know as trackers the fundamentals and principles are the same were ever you are. So weather you are naturalist, search&amp;rescue, law enforcement or a military tracker, the information presented in this text will enhance your overall knowledge of tracking; man or beast.  If this book goes out of print do your self a favor and track down a used copy, it will be well worth your time and effort, because that is what I did. But luckly it is back in PRINT!!

I found this book to be an easy read, it is clearly illustrated and historically accurate. This 'how to' book is a comprehensive text, covering night fighting from the ninja to the modern day night fighters of the world's special forces. This eye-opening book will not leave you in the dark.<br /><br />---UPDATED REVIEW 17DEC11---<br /><br />I still maintain a 5-star review on this enlightening historical look at night fighters past and present. This book does a good job at explaining rudimentary and primitive techniques of stealth, concealment, observation and awareness. It does not have all the answers and covers some topics briefly, but provides a good overview. This is not meant to be a collage thesis or academic reference but an interesting and laidback primer on the skills of history's past night fighters. If this book interests you I would look into getting some of the following books;<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0873643291 Shadows of Darkness: Secrets of the Night Fighter]]\\" by Sid Campbell. This book is similar to \\"Knights of Darkness\\" in its depth and techniques covered. But still and interesting and entertaining read.<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:1440203717 Own the Night: Selection and Use of Tactical Lights and Laser Sights]]\\" by Scott W. Wagner. I did a full review of this book on Amazon. This book is OK but is predominantly a \\"catalog\\" of night fighting enhancement equipment (lights, lasers, etc.).<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:1581600267 Fight At Night: Tools, Techniques, Tactics, and Training for Combat In Low Light and Darkness]]\\" by Andy Stanford. This is one of the benchmark references on fighting in limited-visibility; some of the material is now dated but is still the best modern text available.<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0873643615 Night Fighter's Handbook]]\\" by Dennis J. Popp. This book is formatted like an Army field manual and is chockfull of excellent tactics, techniques and procedures on military night fighting operations.<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0979669006 Rule the Night, Win the Fight]]\\" by Ed Santos. This book is on par with \\"Fight at Night\\" with current information as it is one of the most resent published books on night fighting.<br /><br />I think the above books will do a good job at making you a well-informed individual on the topic of night fighting.e Fight]]\\" by Ed Santos.

Tracks in the "REAL WORLD" not the "SPIRIT WORLD"	REVIEW UPDATED 7 July 2012:<br /><br />Donelan... Tracks in the \\"REAL WORLD\\" not the \\"SPIRIT WORLD\\"<br /><br />I originally wrote my Amazon review for \\"Tactical Tracking Operations: The Essential Guide for Military and Police Trackers\\" by David Scott-Donelan (DSD) over 11-years ago and felt I needed to update it. Why you might ask; well because with the current slew of tracking books on the market today (including my own) this book is still my go-to book for tactical tracking reference and has stood the test of time.<br /><br />Appropriately DSD with his extensive battle-hardened military background in Special Warfare and specifically his knowledge of combat/tactical tracking (C/TT) re-introduced this forgotten and misunderstood subject back into the American mainstream. This revitalization was the first time C/TT has been emphasized since the end of Vietnam with the deactivation of the U.S. Army visual tracker and tracker dog teams and without DSD C/TT would have remained a lost art and science in the American military psyche. Since the mid-1980's DSD has not stopped promoting C/TT as a viable military tactic to find, fix, and finish enemy combatants and has trained thousands in this skill-set. C/TT methods, tactics, techniques, and procedures have proven successful in low-intensity conflicts and counter-insurgency operations over and over historically around the globe from Malaya, Kenya, Vietnam and Israel to Rhodesia, South Africa and now proven highly effective again in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />What does this have to do with the book, well DSD was not only the first to re-introduce this skill to Americans, but also to teach and publish these tracking methods in America that have been employed in every conflict since being re-introduced. These methods taught were originally adaptations of the Rhodesian methods modified into what is now considered the Modern Combat Tracking method pioneered by DSD.<br /><br />The book itself is meant to be a \\"guide\\" and not complete treatise on the subject. It would take numerous volumes to cover every possible tracking scenario for every terrain, climate and associated season for just aging and/or micro/macro tracking information. This would be true for the publishing of any tracking book. However, this book lays down the \\"essential\\" fundamentals very accurately and concisely. That once read a few times and dedicating yourself to some \\"dirt time\\" you could become competent in the methods in short period of time. The Lost Spoor Procedures (LSP) detailed are one of the highlights of the book; due to the aggressive pursuit techniques of bounding and cutting-off trails the trackers have to be apt at rapidly requiring the spoor to continue the pursuit and close that time and distance gap. This is one of the major subjects that make C/TT so different from other methods of tracking like the step-by-step method. Also the sections/chapters on Team Tracking, Command & Control (C2) and Counter Tracking cover information currently not available in other books with the detail presented here. This is the information that separates the \\"tracker\\" from C/TT. Now it would not be fair without disclosing some faults with the book. This book was originally published in 1998 and the chapters on \\"High Tech Help for Tracking Teams\\" and \\"Weapons and Equipment\\" are both today very outdated. Both chapters need to revised and/or deleted in future editions. However, I feel that the limited page count devoted to both of these chapters do not distract for the overall quality of this book.<br /><br />Today DSD is the founder/father of the Modern Combat Tracking method that has been adopted by the USMC and the U.S Army, and has been being used by Special Forces since the late 1980's, this has only added to the creditability and validity of the methods discussed and taught in his book. Today there is only one place to learn this form of tracking from the DSD himself and that is at the \\"David Scott-Donelan Tracking School\\"in Tombstone Arizona. I am very passionate about what DSD has done for military tracking in America because as Special Operations Forces operator with 23-years of active service and multiple trips overseas were I personally employed the methods taught to me by DSD in combat tracking have proved operationally invaluable. I can say without question that his training has saved my life on a couple occasions and has accounted for scores of dead and captured insurgents on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />Finally, this book is not for everyone, it is not about tracking animals or trailing lost children but is about hunting armed and deadly humans. C/TT is a holistic subject of various military/police topics that fills a large portion of the book that maybe irrelevant to other trackers. However, with that said there is still relevant information for all trackers to be found in this book. Just understand what you are purchasing.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: 15 April 2001<br /><br />David Scott-Donelan with this fascinating book brings his hard learned lessons of aggressive mantracking as he used in the counter-insurgency bush wars of Rhodesia and South Africa. His techniques were gleaned from the elite units (Rhodesian SAS, Selous Scouts, and South African Recces) he served with and instructed in the craft of combat tracking. He does not conjure up spirits from the spirit world to interpret spoor but uses techniques of observation and reduction, with a little common sense. His book covers all fundamentals of mantracking on up to equipment selection, multiple team operations, and follow-up methods to list but a few. Donelan has also taken these tried and proven techniques and has slightly modified them for use in law enforcement employment; using tracking as a tool to apprehend fleeing suspects or escapees, to its use and employment in a search and rescue role. All I can say is if you are to own one book on tactical/combat mantracking this is the book, with its 30 years plus of experience between the covers. Donelan is currently working on a follow up book (working title unknown) so keep your eyes open for it. Also if his book is just not enough and you need or want hands on experience or training; Check out his courses on tactical tracking at his website \\"Scott-Donelan Tracking School\\".in Tombstone Arizona.
