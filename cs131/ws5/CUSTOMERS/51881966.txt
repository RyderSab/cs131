Instead of giving us the stock dumb brutes and dumber wenches of too many fantasy adventures, Jones peoples the competing kingdoms with strong female characters and surprisingly emotional men. All of the characters evolve further over the course of the novel, as they face the game. <br /> <br />This book introduces fantasy fans to gifted players, and to a gifted author. Jones makes the game seem real with her vivid descriptions and sharp dialogue, even though everything might not be as real as it seems to the players. To see what I mean, join in the game, the journey, by reading this entertaining fantasy novel.	2005-04-17

Bengston establishes himself as a unique and passionate voice for Omaho, gay men, anyone facing HIV, and anyone who ever felt loneliness or longing. He celebrates all those people and more in this diverse volume, separated into five distinct sections.  <br /> <br />\\"I. NEBRASKA\\" begins the book with images of Bengston's state and its people. These poems mix physical details like streets, buildings, or nature with internal longings. <br /> <br />\\"II. Names\\" reveals Bengston's ability to empathize with others and listen to their dreams. The people differ as much as the forms his poems take. <br /> <br />\\"III. T-Cells\\" reveals Bengston's personal struggle with HIV, as well as with HIV medications. It also reveals courage, hope, and frustration. This section includes my favorite poem in the entire book, \\"Standing at the Edge of the Quilt.\\" That poem involves the AIDS quilt. <br /> <br />\\"IV. Letters\\" includes poems that literally sound like letters. The recipients vary from Bengston's family members to an author of graphic novels. <br /> <br />\\"V. First Chill\\" features the most erotic and emotional poems of this collection. Even more than in the other sections, Bengston keeps the readers off guard and can change the feel of an entire poem with the last line or two. This section provides a satisfying conclusion to a book that I would suggest for poetry lovers everywhere.	2005-03-23

Years later, one of its citizens develops a unique identity as well, adapting to her culture by taking on the identity of a man. Soon, she finds that her gender-blurring actually appeals to her in ways beyond what her situation demands of her. <br /> <br />I love Mission Child as much as McHugh's more popular novel China Mountain Zhang, which received the James Tiptree, Jr. Memorial Award, the Lambda Literary Award, and the Locus Award for Best First Novel. <br /> <br />McHugh is a great writer who can involve readers in any scene, regardless of how much or how little action that scene contains. The language seems descriptive to an extreme, but she still manages to tie those descriptions into the thoughts and feelings of the characters. <br /> <br />Before reading her work, I read reviews that included complaints about her supposedly not focusing on plot. Readers can find countless formulaic, plot-driven science fiction and fantasy novels, but they won't find many original and evocative writers of McHugh's caliber. <br /> <br />McHugh's other novels include Nekropolis and Half the Day Is Night.	2004-08-16

The science fiction and adventure elements keep sneaking into the narrative, along with hints of possible supernatural activity. Still, author W. Lambert III stays tightly focused on the Western-style hero, David Brentridge.<br />In fact, David takes up most of the ink in this book. We often see only him, or just him with brief appearances from the other characters. Fortunately, Lambert makes David a unique and fascinating character who slowly reveals more and more about himself and his family through his actions, dialogue, and thoughts.<br />The people who keep crossing David's path in one way or another might want the Brentridge gold, and he rarely can decide which of them to trust. Lambert even holds back from the readers why the gold involves so many secrets, far beyond any obvious fortune, but he gives us fascinating hints and glimpses through David and an ancient shaman. He also gives a fast-paced, unpredictable read.	2004-01-29

Besen's book Anything but Straight: Unmasking the Scandals and Lies Behind the Ex-Gay Myth. Besen not only gives an accessible and easy-to-follow history of the sham's path of destruction but also makes it clear why so many gays and nongays choose to believe its obvious lies. He also exposes the many people who profit monetarily, politically, or even sexually from ensnaring more ex-gay followers. <br />Still, Besen also shows how most of the people who become involved with or lead these ministries probably mean well. More importantly, he shows how gays and their allies can expose these hurtful groups, which rely heavily on wild semantics, shaky statistics, pseudo psychology, and highly questionable science, all the while trying to appear Bible-based. <br />Besen also shows how gays can make their communities less vulnerable to ex-gay groups, while warning those communities about insidious new tactics that the increasingly media-savvy ex-gay leaders use to lure parents into forcing children to join the ex-gay circus. For groups that keep claiming that all of their members come there voluntarily, they certainly keep taking advantage of parental pressuring and other fears of rejection!<br />Best of all, Besen offers resources and alternatives for people who might want to join these groups. He even defends, to my satisfaction, his undercover efforts to capture all of the information that appears in this sometimes shocking but always fascinating volume. I suggest Besen's study for all gays, all of their allies, and anyone who thinks the ex-gay movement needs support or more recruits.<br />I also suggest Ronald L. Donaghe's scathing fictional treatment of the ex-gay movement, The Salvation Mongers, as well as the disturbing documentary One Nation Under God and-for some needed levity on the topic-the silly yet likable comedy But I'm A Cheerleader.	2003-12-02

William Maltese, best known for hugely popular gay novels like Summer Sweat, When Summer Comes, and the Stud Draqual Mystery Series, offers a gay adventure novel, SS Mann Hunt. <br />Actually, this first-person narrative seamlessly combines adventure, romance, and erotica. The erotica takes over at times, and even some of the narrator's descriptions of physical surroundings become intensely sexual.<br />With Brad Lexly and Kurt Mann searching a South American jungle to learn what happened to their fathers, they constantly encounter danger, and have constant encounters with each other. Some might call it pulp fiction, but from an inventive author who can turn phrases in brilliant ways and keep readers turning pages.<br />Adding to the tension, it looks like Kurt's father-the renowned scientist Sebastian S. Mann-might have been a Nazi war criminal. Twists and turns occur often, but Maltese holds off on the biggest revelations until late in the novel.<br />Maltese's life sounds like an adventure, so it's no surprise that he excels at writing adventure. Besides authoring over a hundred novels under various names, he has served in the U.S. Army, traveled the globe, and worked with a vast array of publishers. Book lovers will doubtlessly keep hearing his name(s) during talks of many different genres, and I look forward to discovering more of his writing.	2003-10-18

While the first two books in The Continuing Journals of Will Barnett focused on young gay love in an anti-gay setting, this longer, more complex installment uses that relationship to explore the difficulties of lasting gay relationships and the challenges of a growing gay civil rights movement. Setting the book in Austin and San Francisco during the 1970s gives author Ronald L. Donaghe many opportunities to examine those changing times, while still keeping the focus on Will and Lance. <br />The young lovers now find themselves split between those two cities, because of college and life-long ambitions. As with any long-distance relationship, theirs becomes tested in many ways. However, unlike their heterosexual counterparts, they lack role models for their relationship, since even Will's beloved Uncle Sean has not maintained the lasting love he sought.<br />This book's epilog closes the journals out for now, with Donaghe giving some clever winks and nods to his many loyal readers. We know we can expect at least one more visit with Will and Lance, and that we can expect many more unforgettable characters from the ever-creative mind of Ronald L. Donaghe.<br />-Duane Simolke, author of The Acorn Stories and Degranon	2003-07-19

The action of this romantic science fiction thriller takes place in two different centuries: the 25th century, plagued by homophobia and unquestioned propaganda, and the 19th century, a time of discovery and superstition. <br />After Technical Sergeant Kallen Deshara keeps finding gay sexual partners in a military that supposedly has no gays, he finally falls in love. Unfortunately, he does so during a mission that takes him into the past. The object of his affection had also been seeking a life-long, romantic bond with another man. <br />Kendrick keeps the scientific explanations in the narrative short but believable, focusing instead on intrigue, character development, and relationships. The pace never slows, and the book's time travel premise sneaks shockingly but somehow naturally into the already complex lives of the characters. Yes, it seems impossible in terms of what they know, but they were already starting to learn that much of what they supposedly \\"knew\\" isn't reality at all. <br />Appearing together in a single volume, Books I and II of the Stealing Some Time trilogy will take readers out of reality as well.

With all of my books published POD (print-on-demand), I often find expert advice of \\"how it's done in the business\\" worthless. The rules for traditional publishing differ from those for POD publishing. Both offer unique limitations and unique freedoms. John F. Harnish explains all of that, and proves how POD actually offers more than traditional publishing on many levels.<br />Anyone considering using a POD publisher needs to read this book first, then read back through sections of it during and after the submission and publication process. Any writer, or any publicist, already involved with POD in any way should read this book now. Harnish gives all of the ins and outs of the POD industry, both as an employee of Infinity Publishing and as a POD author.<br />I can't say that I agree with all of Harnish's views on POD books or POD authors, but I can't say that I agree with all of anyone's views on anything. However, Harnish makes a bold and unusual step that further enriches an already valuable book: he brings in the views and experiences from dozens of other POD authors, in their own words. As I read those words, I kept making observations like \\"Yes, I know what you mean,\\" or \\"I wish I would have thought of those points before wasting that time or money.\\" The whole book seems like an incredibly helpful writer conference, one where everyone leaves feeling more informed and empowered.<br />(Duane Simolke's books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)	2003-01-15

Lee's hilarious first novel, Taxing Tallula, I had looked forward to the spin-off, The Sisters: Lost in Brooklyn. Though taking the characters out of the fictional Tallula, Louisiana setting and changing the focus from the first book's main character to her aunts, that one proved to be just as funny. The series now continues with The Sisters: Found in San Antonio. <br />Anyone looking for uptight, bitter, and dark Southern fiction should look elsewhere. Louisiana native Leona Lipari Lee has also lived in Texas, and now Tennessee. She captures the South with light-hearted but irreverent grace. While leaving no subject too sacred, she also treats her characters with love, as if sharing memories of her own family. Yes, there is a lot of blushing, but she also tells you what caused all the blushing!<br />For those of you who haven't read the first two books, it really doesn't matter. The Sisters are constant gossips who will tell you all need to know about everyone's background, everyone's business. They will also make you laugh constantly with their bizarre but believable quirks, actions, and expressions.<br />Maybe you weren't looking for a comedy caper that involves three women who have been in menopause for ten years, a niece who is on parole for a strange accident, and a Santa Claus killer with a flair for poorly articulated threats. Still, The Sisters: Found in San Antonio will keep you laughing. And you'll realize that L. L. Lee is the real find. She captures the banter and warmth of family, along with the excitement of a light-hearted suspense thriller. Most of all, though, she'll make you forget everything else and get lost in the world of her books. <br />Without giving anything away, it was obvious from the ending that some of the characters from the first book will be re-joining the series, and that more adventures will spring from Tallula, Louisiana.	2002-11-05

But some of them are both witty and exciting, focusing on character development more than the actual crimes. A Dangerous Thing provides a good example of that. <br />Adrien's thoughts in response to the other characters often differ from what he really says; otherwise, he would find himself in even more trouble! He is a sarcastic individual, but still lovable! <br />As with the first novel in this series, Adrien's passion for writing and for mystery books tie in with the plot. And homophobia again complicates that plot. When this murder investigation begins, he's in love with a closeted and obviously self-loathing cop, and surrounded by bigoted local law enforcement. Adrien's health problems make matters worse, along with the fact that he has been accused of murder before.<br />While I loved Fatal Shadows, I think Lanyon has matured even more as a writer. His prose breezes by, never allowing readers to slow down, but also making them not want to slow down. He describes scenes in intricate details when needed, without boring readers with unneeded details. Also, his knowledge of his genre works smoothly into Adrien's character, helping Adrien solve the mystery. <br />This novel should please fans of Fatal Shadows, while also winning Lanyon new readers!<br />(Duane Simolke's books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)	2002-11-05

He also reveals surprising information about many plants-from garlic to tobacco-and their interactions with both the Earth and the human body. Most importantly, he accomplishes his study in simple language that almost any reader can understand and apply. My only complaint would be the extreme length of his paragraphs; especially for nonfiction and complex subjects, I think most readers prefer short paragraphs. Aside from that, this book should appeal to any people who want to improve and extend their lives. <br />Since many of his diet suggestions might not appeal to some people, Irion also offers alternatives.

I?ll forego the knee-jerk comparisons to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter that all high fantasy receives these days and tell you the simple truth: novelist Ronald L. Donaghe has created a world unlike any other, but with constant echoes of our own. The names, the places, the cultures, and the beliefs all seemed familiar enough that I could relate to and imagine them. Yet their differences from our world constantly surprised me.<br />When young Jeru breaks away from his family in the search for what caused a plague upon Omoham, he embarks on a series of adventures and soon becomes involved with one person who will become his mate and several other people who will become their allies in seeking the cause of the plague. However, their journey to Cin?tis will involve them in much more, as Jeru finds himself entwined in a battle to rid Omoham of a violent group called the ?Ch?turc.?<br />The names become comfortable after a while, just like the dialects. If you set the book aside for a few days, you might need to check the handy glossary in the back of the book, but why would you set this book aside? Despite its length (much longer than what I usually prefer), Volume 1 breezes by, entangling readers in its mists (you?ll have to read the book to know what I mean by that). <br />It also ends at a satisfactory place. It left me wanting more, without leaving me angry that I have to wait a while before Volume 2. I look forward to reading that book, as well as the two other books in this fantasy series, which Donaghe named ?Twilight of the Gods.? Silver Dragon Books has taken on several authors who look promising, and I?m glad to see Donaghe now added to that list.	2002-09-11

In doing so, she asserts her own identity as woman and lesbian and her own power over language in a world that often leaves both female and homosexual voices silent. <br />The language she creates seems almost alien at times, though she mostly relies on common words. I certainly wouldn't call this \\"casual\\" or \\"light\\" reading, but I also wouldn't call it intentionally difficult. I would call it defiantly original.

Donaghe agreed to my suggestion that I write the preface to this novel. Lance is a great follow-up to Uncle Sean, the first book in The Continuing Journals of Will Barnett. Its also a fitting chapter in the career of one of gay fictions best writers.<br />If you liked any of Donaghes previous novels, you should like this one as well. It brings back the New Mexico landscape, the fears over difference, and the need to remain a part of ones family while remaining true to ones self. As Will enters adulthood, he finds that his love for Lance will continue to complicate his life and his relationship with others. Friends become enemies, and enemies become potential allies. Everything changes as people begin to confront their prejudices and insecurities. <br />Like The Salvation Mongers (still my favorite of Donaghes books) and Uncle Sean, this novel also confronts the abuse that sometimes hides within seemingly ideal homes. All in all, though, Donaghe offers hope to those who will be true to themselves and tolerant of others. Youll find a lot of sex, as well as a lot of evocative descriptions of farm life and natures beauty. But youll more likely remember the tender love story and how lifes problems and opportunities affect that love.	2002-05-29

However, I understand... rejecting this book for stepping so far away from formulaic scifi storytelling. <br />This isn't \\"paint-by-numbers\\" or \\"insert flap A into slot B.\\" It's imaginative writing from an author who obviously cares more about language and character than about writing something that most creative writing classes would use as a model for \\"proper\\" novel structure.

Matt Bauers striking artwork on the cover caught my interest even more. <br />As the words he chose for his title and subtitle suggest, Berman can find something obscure or archaic, then turn it into something wondrous and unpredictable. <br />While Berman will certainly appeal to fans of modern horror writers like Clive Barker, his writing seems more like a reshaped, updated, and gay-themed version of Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Like those 19th century authors, both of whom helped shape fantastic fiction, Berman can use a few suggestive words, emotions, or images to spawn entire worlds of fear, dread, and awe. But also like those writers, he makes us want to keep exploring the dark forests of the human mind, to see how the experience will affect us.<br />Of course, in Bermans case, we mostly find modern landscapes, such as run-down apartment buildings that house demons, spiders, ghosts, and seductive hustlers. Or we find familiar situations that many gays can relate to, such as a young gay man who worries that he might not be as attractive as his gay buddy or the men in one of their favorite magazines. <br />These stories arent always dark. They can be hopeful or erotic, and theyre sometimes even funny, though Berman often adds to the intensity by mixing the fearful with those more positive elements. I loved these thirteen stories by Steve Berman, and I hope he wont stop with the Triskaidecollection that introduced me to his work.<br />We can now find many writers that bring the gay fiction genre into the sub-genres of science fiction, fantasy, and/or horror. Ive barely started exploring the works of such writers, but I consider Trysts a great place to start!	2002-05-21

I was surprised and happy to learn of his plans to first write a sequel to Desert Sons. Though I found the ending of the original completely satisfying, it also left some open possibilities that this book explores.<br />While Desert Sons deftly handles the difficult and sometimes dangerous coming out process of young lovers Ryan and Scott, the sequel finds that lingering tensions remain, while new challenges continue to surface. Infidelity, jealousy, town gossip, and buried feelings threaten to destroy their relationship. Worse yet, the threat of violence looms constantly in their lives.<br />Fans of Desert Sons will surely cherish this conclusion to its story-lines. However, I also suggest it to fans of gay teen \\"coming out\\" movies like Beautiful Thing, Get Real, Boy's Life, and Edge of Seventeen. In fact, Kendrick's first two novels would both make great movies themselves!	2002-03-13

Donaghe for novels that explore gay issues, especially his bestseller Common Sons. However, many of his readers have also discovered his autobiography: My Year of Living Heterosexually...and Other Adventures in Hell. I also suggest that book, but Letters in Search of Love...and Other Essays offers a probing look at various other times in his life, finding wisdom, insight, and sometimes humor from those moments. The fact that he wrote the essays at various times allows him to look back more introspectively, discovering and re-discovering the full impact of those moments on his life.<br />In this collection of richly detailed and reflective prose, Donaghe constantly stresses the importance of learning from one's family and one's experiences, which makes the essays themselves so much more than just true stories from a fiction writer. Like one of the other reviewers here at Amazon, I found the tribute to his parents especially touching.<br />You'll share in Donaghe's surprises, disappointments, and personal growth. Though being gay and breaking up with his first lover both affect much of the writing, these essays should appeal to anyone, gay or otherwise, who likes thoughtful, well-written prose that analyzes an individual life. In that analysis, Donaghe finds reasons to keep living, loving, and writing, while you will find reasons to keep reading this truly gifted writer.	2002-02-15

With this one, I kept reading it a little a time, even switching to other novels that I had told someone I'd read. However, I never lost interest in it. Something about this book made me keep wanting to enjoy it over time, and it almost disappointed me when I reached the end. I loved the ending, and the entire book, but its episodic nature and its wild mixture of narrative devices made it a reading experience I kept wanting to sustain. The main character's relationships with his mother, his lovers, and the world bring up a host of insecurities, further complicated by AIDS, materialism, and deep longings.

Sears provides not only an important document of hidden American history but also an entertaining and sometimes disturbing narrative of struggles for freedom and equality. Sadly, though, he sees the same racism and sexism inside gay communities that he saw working against those very communities. While women in general kept fighting to dress as they like, work where they like, and express themselves openly, gay women faced a male-dominated gay movement. While encountering bigotry against their race and closets within their race, gays of color found gay bars and gay organizations just as unfriendly towards them. <br />Despite those tragedies, and despite the other cases of sickening bigotry that this book recounts, Sears offers hope in the fact that he shows progress, and in the fact that he refuses to let voices like Julia Penelope, Mel Boozer, and so many others go unnoticed or undocumented.<br />Anyone interested in history or activism should own this book, regardless of the reader's sexual orientation or political views. I also suggest seeing one of Sears's live presentations, in which he discusses his research. This author's combined enthusiasm for justice, equality, and scholarship come together impressively in both his writing and his appearances.	2001-11-13

That humor comes from timing and odd observations, rather than obvious attempts at making readers laugh. For example, just before Rosamund Stacey loses her virginity, her seducer asks, &quot;Is this all right? Are you all right, will this be all right?&quot; Rosamund then tells us &quot;that was it and it was over.&quot; You'll hate when this book is over.

She prefers boredom over activity, chance over effort, and whatever happens to her over whatever she can make happen. She only falls in love by chance, a corrupt love she never tries to avoid.<br />Since Jane will not reach for it, love must find her. It watches and waits for her to recover from the birth of her second child. Jane, who drifted into marriage then drove her husband away with her passive disinterest, manages to (unintentionally) attract another man, with whom she falls in love. Their love develops not from a courtship, but from his childlike desire to lie in her warm bed, and from her passive inability to refuse him.<br />Jane takes us on a journey through her passive experience to an existential awakening. Though it would seem that a character like the one I describe here would prove intolerable, the talented Margaret Drabble makes us want to take the journey with Jane, and makes us want to see Jane finally discarding her passivity.<br />I consider The Waterfall Drabbles finest novel, and hope that more readers will discover it.	2001-11-10

Donaghe's other novels, Uncle Sean is certainly no less realistic, thought-provoking, or intriguing. Though told entirely in first person, the narrative actually uses three different voices. The first voice is that of a man who finds the materials and instills in readers a desire to learn the story they hold. Another is of the young man Will Barnett, who realizes that he wants a boyfriend. And the third voice is of Uncle Sean himself, the object of Will's affection. Donaghe uses each voice as a different way of exploring the complexities of same-sex attraction and, more universally, the frustrations of feeling isolated and rejected. The Salvation Mongers remains my favorite of Donaghe's novels, but Uncle Sean is perhaps his most touching novel, and I think countless readers will relate to Will's desire to find someone \\"pretty\\" to love forever.	2001-10-31

This novel suggests otherwise; the book's afterword (a non-fiction essay) proves otherwise.<br />From my research into the ex-gay movement, and from my conversations with people who have seen the rotten fruit of its labor, I know that this work of fiction bares more truth than any of the promises that so-called &quot;reparative therapy&quot; makes.<br />Donaghe creates believable, tortured characters. I've met all the &quot;types&quot; he portrays in The Salvation Mongers, including some of the more sinister characters. I've also seen the beauty of the New Mexico landscape that provides an effective contrast for the ugliness that Donaghe exposes. <br />This book is both alluring and repulsive in its accuracy.

Of course, the various conflicts creep back into the narrative, causing new problems for these believable and complicated teenagers. Both boys are still coming to terms with their sexual orientation, while trying to understand their intense love for each other. Kendrick never shies away from the sexual preoccupation of these teen lovers, but he also never shies away from their fear of prejudice and rejection. Kendrick also writes science fiction, and it will be interesting to see if he can deliver the same character-driven novels in that genre as in this admirable example of gay fiction.	2001-09-03

After Kent and Jamie work together to find a killer, the novel's romance and conspiracies continue to intensify. The more readers might think they know a character, the more complex and surprising that character becomes. Josh Thomas excels at such enigmatic character development. <br />The dialogue seems a bit stilted in a few (and only a few) places, but that's probably because I'm overly accustomed to deep-South syntax. <br />I love the way Jamie cares for his dying mother, and the way he cleverly defends himself against a constant onslaught of homophobic remarks.  His fast wit and rhetorical skills make him believable as an award-winning reporter and a ceaseless charmer.  Author Josh Thomas, also an award-winning reporter, will charm you with his careful phrasing and tremendous story-telling talents.	2001-08-08

Editor Michael Dubson has gathered an impressive collection of essays from adjunct college instructors across America. Those essays reveal a system in which half the teachers work for half the money that the other teachers receive. However, they do as much or more work, receive no benefits, and have no job security beyond the current semester. Colleges and universities routinely exclude these adjuncts from the privilege, protection, advancement, and recognition that their better-paid colleagues receive. <br />Aside from these conditions, the adjuncts also face bizarre situations, such as students who will bring law suits when caught cheating, or such as incomes created by piecing together teaching assignments from two-six different institutions at a time! <br />All the writers here illustrate how the current policies toward adjuncts hurt the students, the educational system, and America in general, as much as they hurt the adjuncts themselves. These teachers continue out of love for their students and their subject, but the current system works against such love. Not surprisingly, the book concludes with an essay titled \\"Farewell to Teaching.\\"	2001-06-05

Donaghe's autobiography reads like those novels, complete with vivid descriptions and frequent dialogue. It also includes Donaghe's observations about homophobia, gays in the military, and the attempts of some gays to \\"go straight.\\" Donaghe uses his experiences and those of the people around him to make those observations. However, he does so without turning this fast-paced narrative into an academic essay.

Hazel tackles her journey with humor and tenacity: from the embarrassing arrival of a sex manual as a book-of-the-month selection, to her experimentation with sexual adventure, and to some surprising revelations.<br />Boydstrom's narrator offers way too much detail for polite conversation, but that bluntness adds not only to the novel's realism but also to its razor-sharp humor.

Well, read the novel.<br />In addition to believability, Hazel also creates beautiful prose. Often, the paragraphs become extremely short, with terse but elegant phrasing that captures the tensions and fears that haunt Rusty and the other characters.

Blair Schulman's first-person narrator gives playful descriptions of the novel's other characters. He always seems at least vaguely amused by his surroundings, and by the people in those surroundings. Schulman utilizes the narrator's witty observations as a way of offering descriptions-as opposed to giving bland, static descriptions of the characters, action, and settings. <br />I kept looking forward not only to what would happen next but also to what the narrator would say about it. For example, the pretentious snobs he encounters generally lack any sense of decorum or self-control, making them fodder for more of his quips. <br />If you like witty, zany, fast-paced reading, this book will make you want to write love letters to author Blair Schulman!	2001-03-07

Lee's first novel will appeal to anyone who enjoys fast-paced farcical literature with an emphasis on eccentric characters. But it will especially appeal to anyone with small-town experiences. Having lived most of my childhood in Louisiana, I must say that Lee's Louisiana reflects the real one in the funniest and most bizarre ways. But gambling problems, the mob, and crooked politicians in the Pelican State? Can I believe all of that? Well, actually, yes.<br />One scene in particular epitomizes Lee's comic skills. When a hard-at-hearing man happens into the middle of a poorly timed break-up of two lovers, his attempt at comprehending the words somehow turns into a threat that causes him to leave all his money and take off running! <br />The main character, T.J. Marino, is a special treat who will stay in the minds of readers, even after they forget the details of the plot. Marino is one of those offbeat, lovable characters who manages to put herself into every bad situation possible! However, you can put yourself into a good situation by reading this delightful book!	2001-03-02

San Antonio, Texas, provides the setting for a power struggle among vampires. We immediately see the tension between Prince Ramses and Zapporoah, the sister he fears. All of the vampires in this novel find victims by appealing to the human needs for sex or company, or by preying on the most sinister representatives of the human race. The vampires seem as authentic and as unlike each other as the real people in our real lives. In fact, Jones carefully creates a mythic world that seems strangely ordinary, as if this violent drama could actually lurk around any corner, potentially disrupting our safe existence.<br />Since I live in Lubbock, Texas, I was happy (or maybe disturbed) to learn that Lubbock has a vampire on the Council of Ramses! Jones constantly and skillfully weaves familiar places and familiar mythology into the narrative, compounding that feeling that this world seems oddly like our own. <br />Among some members of the Kindred, the thirst for power rivals the thirst for blood, making them even more dangerous to humanity and to their fellow vampires. The ensuing battle threatens ancient codes of honor and tradition, revealing the meaning behind the book's subtitle: \\"A Vampire's Lesson in Betrayal.\\"	2001-02-07

This book will upset people whose childhood included rejection by their parents or their classmates. It will upset people who think everyone should look, think, and act alike. It will even upset people who know the satisfaction of treating everyone with dignity and respect. In other words, this book will disturb countless readers. Why? Because Ronald Donaghe offers such an honest and detailed look at two boys who fall in love with each other in a staunchly anti-gay New Mexico town.<br />Despite the novel's many portrayals of negative and even violent responses to the love between Tom and Joel, Donaghe delivers an ultimately inspiring tale of how two people can overcome the obstacles that could deter their happiness and honesty. This book can give hope to the many gays who still fear being themselves, and it can give hope to the many older gays who worry that their young counterparts will always face nothing but hatred and violence. But its appeal isn't limited to gays; nongays might read it to understand people who are different from themselves, or just because they like reading a well-written and exciting novel.	2001-01-16

Whitaker uses a funny situation with snappy dialogue to introduce us to the offbeat character of Alex, who then takes over as narrator. Alex's romantic interest, Marissa, also narrates parts of the novel. Both narrators are fascinating people with a wealth of experiences and many keen observations. Letting the two main characters split the storytelling allows the readers to see every side of those characters, without giving away the novel's surprise twists too soon. Whitaker mixes humor with compassion and a variety of social issues. Whether trapped in an elevator, confronting bigoted neighbors, or maneuvering through a budding relationship, Whitaker's characters shine with realism and charm.	2001-01-05

Huda Orfali's first book, Blue Fire, received several strong reader reviews here at Amazon.com. Orfali's second book offers stories of people learning to deal with the harsh realities of life and death. Relying heavily on dialogue, Orfali shows people who must confront unexpected changes, including some tragic changes. The characters range from a ballerina, to a camera man, to a vampire. <br />One of my favorite selections is the title story, in which a father's letters help him examine his feelings about his son's illness.<br />Orfali gives realistic glimpses at the more difficult moments in people's lives. Still, she also celebrates the strength of human relationships and the protective love of parents for their children. <br />These stories reflect a deep understanding of human nature and a deep love for the written word.	2000-10-25

I read this novel long ago, and was happy to see that it has recently become much more popular.  Toni Morrison realistically taps into the desires of children, such as the desire to feel acknowledged by one's parents, or the desire to feel beautiful.  Sadly, her characters fail to  see the beauty they already possess, and instead seek validation from  people who might hurt them.<br />The language of this novel is both poetic and  gritty.  Morrison is too honest to let elegance keep her from depicting the  tragedy and betrayals in many families.  But she is also too gifted to  simply present a tragic situation without using language that elevates its  characters above that situation.  She allows her characters to affect our  lives, no matter how helpless they might seem in shaping their own  lives.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has dealt with abuse,  rejection, or internalized racism.  I would also recommend it to anyone who  wants an example of great black literature, great women's literature, or  just plain great literature.	2000-04-27

The character Marc (or, Marco) drifts through Orfali's stories, bringing hope and compassion to often hopeless or brutal situations.  Orfali is the real Marc, in that she gives a devastatingly honest view of life's cruelty,  yet brings optimism to that view.  However, she does so without giving  easy, contrived solutions.  She also does so with charming characters and  believable dialogue.  <br />Her poems range from depictions of her Syrian  homeland to scenes from treasured myths and legends.  My favorite of the  poems is \\"Flip, Flop.\\"  The narrator of that poem forces us to consider the  results of violence, who is to blame for it, and who can help stop it; yet  the poem also manages to surprise the reader.  For that matter, Orfali's  work is a constant surprise.	2000-04-18

Kader has both a deeply analytical mind and a deeply loving spirit.  In this well-researched and carefully phrased study, he challenges homophobic readings of the Bible and uses his knowledge of scripture to  show the Bible as &quot;gay-friendly.&quot;  He also uses his experiences  to show the results of homophobia within the church and the questionable  value of &quot;ex-gay&quot; ministries.  This is one of the best books of  its kind!  <br />Kader might overstate (and re-state) some of his points at  times, but only because so many hearts are so hardened by arrogance,  bigotry, or self-hatred.
