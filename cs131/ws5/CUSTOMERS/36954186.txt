These images are the original archetypes that would cause such a dramatic interest in this rather obscure means of \\"fortune telling\\". It is true the images are not vibrant and colorful. The Universal Waite deck came nearly a century later and lovingly pays tribute to these original images. Many other \\"clones\\" would follow with various intrepretations/colorations. The basic images remain a constant. <br /> <br />This was the first set of images I was exposed to years ago and have grown to love over time. They have mystery and depth to them which must be experienced first hand. All modern standards come from this set. The backs are the best intrepretation I have ever seen. Much better then the busy lines that most see. The soft colors with their tan tone is soothing to the eye. While not an \\"absolute\\" original reprint of the deck, I feel this is the closest one can get!	2005-10-05

This is one of those strange and interesting decks that would lay the foundation for the modern Tarot boom. I found it at an estate sale for about $7.00. WOW look at the collectible value by various sellers. Another deck that needs to be reissued by U.S. Games and kept in print!<br /><br />Now onto the cards. The images themselves are the first modern interpretation of the classic Marseilles deck that had been published for centuries. I beilieve this deck was published in the 1880s. The Trump cards are very modern in design. They rely heavily on Egyptian symbology and Hebrew Qabala references. The trumps are clearly numbered with Hebrew letters accurately perscribed. The colors are dark, almost murky. Most may feel these cards are negative. I view them from an objective perspective. The minor trumps are not fully illustrated, rather containing mysterious symbols on them. The court cards all have \\"Egyptian\\" style figures, that give little to the meanings.  Considering when it was published, it seems very progressive.<br /><br />It seems Papus designed the deck for \\"magicians\\" of the time. The deck has a very occult feel to it. These card were not meant to be sold to the mass public. This gives them a deeper sense of the \\"mysterious\\". One can imagine what the magical circles in Paris were like at the time. Did I mention the deck was originally published in France based on the writings of Etteilla-the great master wizard of 18th century Paris? That should spark one's interest in the deck, as well as its rarity.<br /><br />The deck is not for everyone. Beginners hold off on this one! This is not a modern \\"New Age\\" deck. If the Golden Dawn and various other occult subjects interest you, then try it. I would not read for others with this deck. There are some scary \\"vibes\\" associated with it. To serious collectors and scholars, it is a must for those who want to take their studies a little deeper.	2005-10-05

There are not many authentic books that deal with this subject in an accurate/mystical approach. Mr Barrett is a learned scholar and archologist from Britain. What could his take on Egypt mean to the explorer of the mystical side? Lots! <br /> <br />To begin, this book is filled with information about most of the gods I could think of and more. Many are all but obscured and forgotten. The very myths behind these wonderful illustations are profound. This complements, but is not required to study and use his great Ancient Egyptian Tarot. I cannot understand why the book is no longer in print. Not all books have to be a best seller. I suppose the publisher had some issues here. <br /> <br />As for myself, there are no critical marks regarding this historically accurate and beautifully illustrated text. I would recommend getting it used, as I can see the value go up over the years.	2005-09-28

I am a bit appalled by the negative reviewers out there who say mean things about this precious tome of real magick! I suppose \\"pop wicca\\" by bestselling authors who know very little about real Witchcraft, the way it was meant to be practiced, is more appealing to these folk! I love this book and use it quite frequently. I feel it is very modern in its approach and contains some wonderful illustrations. <br />  <br />Mr Fitch is a modern guru of Witchcraft that is very underrated in the world of \\"pop wicca\\". It is interesting to note that many of his beautiful rituals appear in many other books published by Llewellyn. He is not even given credit! He claims most of these rituals are all public domain. Indeed, they should be.   <br /> <br />His magical training section is very difficult and should be at least tried by anyone seriously interested in the craft. He personally invites anyone who masters these techniques to contact him through the publisher. Good luck to all who attempt them! Mastery is surely a sign that one is a real Witch! <br /> <br />Call me old fashioned, I feel this is the way that witchcraft should be practiced. A year and a day passes quickly. Why not savor them with study and reflection? Sadly, this volume has gone out of print. It should be required reading for anyone attempting the path.	2005-09-28

I remember the fear and anticipation I felt, as my initial studies of a magical life began. Sure, it can be dry and dated to some. This is not witchcraft for teens, rather honest and accurate. It is hard to believe how many many others would follow. I remember seeing Mr Buckland on local T.V. in the 1970s. I thought, this style of witchery was very intriging. I was just a boy. I would later grow up to be a real witch just like him:-)   <br /> <br />There have been many others who have tried to follow, some rather successfully.  I believe he set the standard for modern Witchcraft in the U.S. Seeing a copy in ones library alone means one takes this form of spirituality seriously. By all means, this is required reading in starting down this path.  <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that this book was originally intended for covens or groups. This tradition didnt seem to catch on in the States as well as Britain. Solitary practice seems to be more accesible to many American Witches. This says much about the Yankee spirit. I deeply admire and respect anyone who can maintain regular covens!	2005-09-28

Putting most authors who venture in this subject to shame, Ly De Angeles shines. This book is great for all beginners and intermediaries and shame on yourself if you call yourself advanced! I have been practicing since 1986 and still consider myself a beginner. This user freindly guide makes no apologies about its rich content, and gothic looking cover. I must admit I was a little afraid to pick it up. It looks potent, and is. <br /> <br />All of the basics that one should know is contained within. She covers most of the path that one would follow if one would call oneself a witch. This is not an absolute guide that preaches that you should practice witchery a certain way or it wont work. Like most great guides, it serves as a fence around the very structure of magical practice. That is why it is said one practices witchcraft. Practice makes for a very skilled witch. I am sure she is one.  <br /> <br />Everything from astral travel to tarot reading is contained within. A great reference to keep on hand when needed. Those of you too good to have this book around, can get on your broomsticks and fly over my house.	2005-09-21

This is hands down the best book on tarot history and the origin of the cards there is and more. Classical mythology, history and fine art are the key words here. I found a new appreciation for an already great tarot deck. His book A Renaissance Tarot is the best there is as far as a course in Western traditions are concerned.  <br /> <br />Mr Williams was probably the greatest scholar of the tarot to come from the U.S. to date. He passed in 2002 and left this wonderful legacy for all to share for generations to come. There are few books that mean as much.  He gave the best in the business as far as I am concerned. <br /> <br />If you are looking for mysterious links to Egypt, Atlantis or Gypsies, look elsewhere. This beautifully illustrated book is packed with historical facts and mythological references that take you back to the real origins of the Tarot-Italy. It is well reseached with many original drawings by Brian himself.  <br /> <br />This may be a new perspective for some in the New Age world. Tarot is something that can be translted into many different themes and philosophies. There is nothing wrong with that. It is the most universal tool of its kind. I have seen Egyptian, Hebrew, Celtic, Norse, Chinese, Middle Eastern and various fantasy themes that are all launched from these not so humble origins-The Classical worlds of Greece and Rome snuggled within the Italian Renaissance! <br /> <br />Whether you prefer this deck or not, if you have any draw to study the Tarot, do yourself a favor and read this precious book! It is a complete course in valid Tarot history. Not bad, considering the price. Oh yes, I recommend this with a good Tuscan Chianti.	2005-09-21

Ms Dugan has given the best work of her career as far as I can tell! Told in her familiar style with much humor, she presents this little known pagan holiday in a clear and well researched edition. Llewellyn must prefer her version over Kristen Maddens previous work that I liked and have a copy that is quickly becoming a collectible. <br /> <br />This version is a little more user freindly in essence. There are great references on harvest dieties,(I admit I had never heard of Pomona before), full moon rituals, and a splendid fall foliage section. This is Ellen's magical forte and it shows. I will never look at my garden the same. Now if only I could get my pumkins to grow... <br /> <br />She even has a recipe section full of tasty sounding dishes that she claims she is not very good at. HA! I am sure the feast at her house is fabulous and filled with great smelling foods of the harvest. The craft section is great as well. Many thoughtful ideas are presented within. <br /> <br />By all means, get a copy of this lighthearted tome of enchantment before Llewellyn disposes of this title as well. Being the garden witch, I would like to see her do a volume on Beltane with all the flower potential. She seems to love fairies too. What a better place to take this talented author!	2005-09-21

With so many tarot decks out there that deal with Arthurian legend and myth, this is easily my favorite. The Matthews are difficult to approach without starting at the beginning. Not an easy task, considering most of the early material is now out of print and difficult/expensive to find. This original Aquarian Press edition I found was from Ebay, at a reasonable price. I was skeptical at first. All of the early decks of this time (1990) are peculiar to say the least. The Merlin Tarot, Celtic Tarot,Greenwood and Norse and Egyptian decks by Clive Barrett all were published by Aquarian Press, now Harper Collins. <br /> <br />The future of these book and card sets seem uncertain, this is sad news for collectors, meaning high prices and scarce supplies! This is one set that I would give top honors to. The book Hallowquest Handbook is excellent in its take on the myth of Camelot! This appears to have been well reserched over many years. This feat is not easy. The only other set which is commonly used as a comparison is Legend: Arthurian Tarot by Ferguson. That deck has more depth, as far as artistry is concerned. I cannot say this set is a copy of the Matthews, but the similarities are there. <br /> <br />The artist is Miranda Gray who's Merlin Tarot is worth mentioning here. Those images are starling, if not more comical than the Arthurian Tarot. Her work here seems more focused and obvious. I appreciate this deck more. Probably because all the card are illustrated. This lends a storytellers perspective within a reading: the essence of Arthurian mythology.  <br /> <br />A little research is required on the Myth itself. This is not a big hurdle in basic understanding of the deck. I like the speads given in the Handbook. The are uncommon from most. Fortune telling is not the focus of this deck, mystical meditation and pathworking is stressed her. Each card has a portal on it. The Celtic otherworld is easily accesible with these images.    <br /> <br />This is easily the best New Age spin on an old legend. It is a major launching pad for modern metaphysical exploration of the legend and yourself. Now for the difficult task of finding the accompaning books to accompany these studies...	2005-09-21

I have been using this system off and on since 1999 and find it very useful! This system is desined for initiates within Tibetan system. In other words, rather useless for non-Buddhist folk. If the Bodhisattva Manjusri means something to you, then seek a copy. You get my meaning... <br /> <br />This is not an ordinary fortune telling kit. Most oracles are designed from a non sectarian point of view. This is not one of them. The system is based on timeless and ageless Buddhist tantras. This makes is meaningless to most people. That doesnt mean you should not use it. If you feel some sort of connection with this system, by all means do so! <br /> <br />This is not based on any Western or New Age system. Closer to the I-Ching, but only by proximity to ancient China. Remember this is Buddhist, making it very unique. Random dice with mantra syllables are cast. It also helps to chant the mantra while casting the dice. Then you get an message from the Bodhisattva of wisdom. Unique and unusual, as this was practiced in old Tibet about anything from lost items to spiritual matters. Now it is available in the West. Use with compassion and wisdom!	2005-09-19

I never picked up a copy until recently. I used the Workbook sold separately when it was first published many years ago. The neo-classical format works within context of all Tarots. Even the Rider-Waite that I was working with at the time can be translated to the Greek myths.    The scholarly appeal behind the original concept are great. Renaissance thinking works best when looking at the mysterious origins of the major Trumps. I really like the ideas presented, and the memorization techniques used here are exceptional! What a better system than using Greek mythology when learning the cards. It worked well for me.     Many years, and decks later, I picked up a copy of the cards themselves at a discount bookseller. The accompaning book uses the same great system of neo-classical theory. Now the cards themselves.First, I will say they give great readings with their coloring.  This is when things begin to fall apart. Maybe this was why the set was so inexpensive.     The major trumps are not numbered to begin with. This is a problem when putting them in in any kind of logical order. The cardstock is flimsy, making them difficult to shuffle. The quality of the drawings themselves seem childish, and overall a disappointment.  A second edition or something with better cardstock. This could easily be a favorite for many people who have an affinity to the Greek pantheon. The deck is now considered a classic.	2005-09-15

This is one of those decks that was published in the early 1990s making it sort of unusual in presentation. To begin with, the author R.J.Stewart designed this deck on the premise that it originated Tarot several centuries before the Visconti-Sforza. Interesting,yet historically unproven. The author even re scrambles the major trumps numbering order giving some strange reasoning here that I still cannot figure out. <br /> <br />Now onto the cards themselves. I really like the artistry on the Major trumps. The moon depicts the pagan goddess Diana. Never seen before, male genitalia on the hermaphrodite in the World card. Bravo to the artist! <br /> <br />The minor arcana is where the deck fall short. There are no illustations here. The court cards are just fine, the faces on them and the major arcana seen a little peculiar. Almost humorous. The author may have been more convincing had more time been spent on illustrating the minors. I am not sold on the wacky revision of the tarot history however.  <br /> <br />I will also add that I feel uncomfortable reading with this deck. This is probably because of the numbers on the major arcana, and the odd nudity. The deck is worth having to amuse yourself with the concept alone.	2005-09-06

This deck is usable but not for beginners. The minors are not illustrated, therefore leaving novice readers guessing meanings during a reading. If you are skilled enough with the cards and like the artistry. give this deck a try. <br /> <br />Now, for the bad news. The accompaning book is terrible. There are many other books that can deliver historically accurate histories and meanings. There seems to be much misinformation on the authors behalf. The history of the Tarot is laughable by todays standard. The history of the Celts is summed up in a few pages. Very unfulfilling. Too much time is spent on picking a significator. I feel this book could use a second edition, by maybe a new author. <br /> <br />My sugestion is to toss the book entirely and read the cards intuitively. The art is worthy, the colors soft, and most meanings are symbolically accurate. Oddly enough,at the end of the deck is an add for the Norse Tarot. Now out of print, one wonders what was wrong with the publishers taking this deck out of print, and leaving this, overall mediocre deck available?	2005-09-06

I had to get this set for the book alone. The late great Mr. Williams was an exceptional artist as well as scholar. He obviously loved what he did-History of art and Tarot. He had a grand passion for these subject like no other. He lived a rich and full life, however short it was. <br /> <br />Above all, he contributed to the vast history of the Tarot leaving behind work that will last for generations to come. One such work is his Ship of Fools Tarot. Not as brilliant as his Renaissance Tarot, it still packs a punch. The colors are all monotone but the imagery and details stand out. There are many other decks that can be used for color.  <br /> <br />This deck is humorous and delightful to approach, as the fool becomes the main character on this profound journey. One feels that the journey is not so serious. Smiles and taking life in stride paramount here. Mr. Williams had an uncanny ability to combine history and humor sucessfully. <br /> <br />What is really great is this is all historically accurate. His drawings only clarify this classic. Don't expect some mystical revelation here. If you find them, congratulations! As far as a reading is concerned, these cards are tighly based on the Rider-Waite system. It works great for beginners, but I would say to start with a color deck. As far as a scholar and serious student is concerned, this should be required study. <br /> <br />I use this deck on gloomy days when I need a good laugh. It works rather well in this case. Thank you, Brian!	2005-08-31

Yes, Martha's Halloween shows were always my favorite. Last year with her incarceration pending, this was all I had to go by.  <br /> <br />The feel is great with a very New England haunted feel. Her chapter on haunting a house was very effective. The folks I live with dislike Martha, so I keep the book hidden. They sure like her recipies that I fix every fall! The pumpkin carving section was packed with ideas as well.  <br /> <br />This had a very contempory feel that would work in many situations. A sequel would be a great addition here.

I was frightened and amazed by what I saw. Sheer Magic in its purest form. This is THE occult tarot deck. More so than the Crowley-Thoth. I thought someday I would like a copy of this precious artifact. I guess I waited too long as it is now out of print. What a shame when the folks at U.S. Games have multiple renditions of the Rider-Waite deck for sale, among others that do not hold any interest to me.    Maybe it is because of the black and white presentation. It could simply be too scary for many! It is no less dark than others on the current market. I really wish someone else would pick up rights to this masterwork and get it back in publication. Or better yet, how about U.S. Games doing so. They are great at what they do. Except holding back this classic and others.    I finally purchased my copy of this deck from the publisher and love it. The LWB presents nothing new here. The deck itself is not ideal for beginners, 12 and older would do best. Astrologically, this system soars! It is also fun to see these images up close. Its possibly the most detailed tarot ever created.	2005-08-24

I absolutely love it, as it is the almost forgotten deck of so many modern ones! All others are launched from this one. I imagine many of the faces depicted here were actual individuals who lived during the Renaissance. Especially the court cards.  <br /> <br />This deck is a must for serious collectors, readers and students of this wonderful art. It carries with it an eerie, from another time feel that should be experienced on its own. The sum of all Tarot decks is carried within. The \\"vibes\\" alone give it this supernatural effect that acts as a time machine. <br /> <br />There are no frills here. The cards themselves are large and difficult to handle. The backs are a simple dull red. The missing cards restored are obviously another artists interpretaions. All of the minors are not illustrated. Most readers should begin elsewhere. Nowadays, there are many places to start. Serious, advanced student should all be required to have a copy of this deck in their collection. <br /> <br />The other decks that mimic this one fall short. Lo Scarabeo published one close with gold leaf restored. It has writing on it and shrunk down to standard size-distracting. Also for a fun spin on this classic is The Medieval Scapini Tarot. I list that as one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />Now just imagine finding this set of cards in a Milanese castle in a strongbox with other artifacts within. The possibilites are the fuel of novels greater than The Davinci Code...	2005-08-24

It is all done with great love and devotion to Isis. <br /> <br />It is true there is not much else about the other gods of Egypt but it says right on the cover-Mysteries of Isis! This is all about the great mother, who faithfully answers most cries. I cannot think of any other goddess who was so revered in popular Western society since Roman times. Maybe the virgin Mary? who is really an emanation of Isis. I remember being in Paris at the old Roman site of her temple, now a Christian church. Her presence was still very strong!  <br /> <br />It is easy to see how this goddess is so accesible to many, pagan or otherwise. She is truely the springtime of the human heart!

I initially overlooked this deck at the time, yet I was always intrigued with the stunning box that shows the Magician and High Preistess.    The rest of cards depicted inside a equally marvelous. I picked this deck up at an estate sale virtually like new. I really am impressed with it. I get the feel of an old Hollywood movie that sort of takes you through time. The Hermit and Temperance has a distinctive Eastern Indian style that I appreciate. Many Yoga practitioners may relate as well!    The encrypted movie stars within have a subtle effect and most barely recognize them in a reading. Myself, on the other hand feel the faded movie stars assist me in readings.They are like new Pagan gods. I wonder if the artist meant for this to happen?    The colors are very soothing and meditative. The system is based for the most part on the Rider-Waite interpretation with some variants. This set is great for beginners who have a witchy background. The pentagram on the backs work very well in this case. Otherwise, one may be frightened by the powerful symbolism.	2005-08-18

The art is very nice. The images are easy to memorize, this is not really required, the cards speak for themselves.(literally, the meanings are written on the cards) <br /> <br />I really admire the deck's artistry, especially the backs. It is as if the cards came from some time forgotten cabinet of curiousities. The feel is geared toward gothic style interpretation without totally leaning on the dark side. The deck's big brother Gothic Tarot is much more serious, as this deals with the classical archetypes directly. Madame Endora could almost be consided a new ager. There is nothing wrong with this at all! <br /> <br />This deck could be easily used by children at a sleep overs and not cause too many nightmares.

This was my first divination set I obtained in 1986. Wow, time flies. Anyways, this set presented much information regarding Egypt and its Gods. True, there have been many books to come out since, that provide deeper knowledge regarding this form of magical practice. This one will always remain near and dear to my heart.      The book still is on my bookshelf and I keep my well worn cards for sentimental reasons. In its day, divining with these cards was always accurate. I even used to carry some of the cards to difficult exams and pass! The simplicity alone is very beneficial. I always felt I was endowed with great knowledge of ancient Egypt. I changed majors to art history at one point.    What I really want to stress here is how I used to read the cards for family and friends. The astrology spread would carry over to bigger and better things. The actual practice with these easy to learn cards led me to studies in astrology, numerology, and most important-Tarot.

I did to much success. It is a shame that this great oracle deck has gone out of print. I would gladly advise new student who want to try Tarot to look at this first.	2005-08-12

The idea was conceived by the author through a series of dreams she had. Truely a magical experience in itself! The ancient people of Egypt used scarabs as a way of documentation of daily life. It is not hard to believe similar items were carried as a charm in everyday life. Therefore this is a great contribution to recontructionist ideas. <br /> <br />Appoximately 30 images come in a great little pouch that can be handily carried around as a possible talisman or charm. Many of the symbols were familiar to me as I had much experience with Egyptolgy in the past. The divinatory meanings are a little difficult to commit to memory at first. Much study and practice with the set results in a trusted system that can be used for many years.  <br /> <br />I have not read with these for others yet. They have a private \\"feel\\" to them. I have always been attracted to Anubis and this was the first scarab I drew! There is much to be experienced with this set. It is well worth the investment if you like things Egyptian.	2005-08-12

I have a copy of this little treasure that I found used at an estate sale for $10. I thought something may be wrong with it. It miraculously was intact! What a jewel in my Tarot collection. I am very familiar with the deck as it is only referred to in legend. It seems the edition stayed in print for a very limited time. I had little interest at the time. Now, after much critical praise and elevating prices, I feel this deck wouldve had a bigger life, given the chance.<br /><br />Now, onto the actual deck itself. All of the majors are unnumbered and do their own thing as far as style goes. The whole feel is this tribal/shaman effect. This is easily passed off into Native American spirituality, had the author/designer not been careful. Instead there is a feel of a pre Celtic style that caught me off guard. Pre Celtic tribalism possibly dating from 10,000 years ago!<br /><br />The accompaning book is a great study guide, as well a spiritual lesson in the modern global environmental movement. This is call for alarm accross the globe. It puts things in perfect perspective for me. That makes the meanings of these rather abstract cards deep. While these would not be great for beginners, the cards are more of an excercise in deep myticism regarding the Earth itself.<br /><br />Some new publisher should pick this deck up and give it a second chance. If those who are luck enough to have a copy of this set, use it with the ancients in mind, with hopes that future generations get to see it.	2005-08-11

I remember reading and practicing from this handy guide in the 1980s. You could say this was the book to start it all for me. There is much to be said about the information here-all being great!  Many of the rituals have been tried and tested solitarily by myself for many years. It devolops faith and trust in contempory witchcraft. <br /> <br />This is probably the book that I would take to a desert island with me. Unlike so many other authors at Llewellyn, Mr Fitch has published very little. I really liked his Grimoire of Shadows. It expands much of what is presented here. This seems to be witchcraft for the unfashionable set.	2005-08-10

This new style set of tarot is done with such flawless grace that it is difficult to find fault with it. Tarot is not new, by a long shot. There is not much left to uncover for myself after looking at so many newer interpretations of the same old pack of cards. This pack moves to motivate myself once more!     At the very least, this set is worthy of gallery sized images. The Art is taken to a new occult level. The Death card is very effective! The Wheel of Fortune is so detailed, it almost moves on its own. The Moon is always my favorite and this one peaks my interest as well. The Sun is beautiful and playful. The human figure is done very tastefully. The nudity used can cause certain clients to blush so, use ones own discretion. The minor arcana is very interesting as well. Details usually overlooked by many artists. All the meanings are very traditional. Great for first time learners, a well as seasoned masters.     This deck is published by U.S. Games. A class act in presentation. Glossy finish makes shuffling the card easier. They are standard size making them easy to handle. I would advise readers who like a darker, more gothic style to use these. They would work well as a meditational tool as well. The Artist website offers the images in a large poster format. This would be great for advertising! Reasonably priced as well.    The artist must have some deep inspiration to do such an honor to this blossoming tool of mysticism. Imagine, digging through sands of some lost civilization and discovering these gems! Or one's own subconcious for that matter.	2005-08-06

Ellen Dugan really proves her stuff, meaning she is the best kept secret in Llewellyn's mostly pretentious list of authors! She is the Garden Witch, like myself. I have been practicing since my Scott Cunningham days in the late 1980s. Ellen is the only author who can follw in his footsteps. <br /> <br />This book covers all the basics and assumes we should have a little experience. This is fine with me. Indeed, it as if Ellen  <br />knew my grandmother and her friends with many of these hints. I use pesticides according to experience. this is only common sense.  <br /> <br />Her theme gardens are wonderful and I have a few in my yard. This year, I am trying my first pumpkin garden. What an idea. <br />The list of her shade garden plants are right on the money. The Craft section redefines Witch-craft for me. She is great with this section.  <br /> <br />The only problem with the book is the language she uses. This is fine for high school students. I hope many of them begin to work the garden at an early age. It is a lifetime reward. I am happy with Ellen's honesty here.	2005-08-02

From spring flower magic to some great recipies that I have tried and wonderful lore of fairies! One simply cannot go wrong. Ms McCoy has much experience under her belt. I remember her earlier work in the 1980s! <br /> <br />True, to the purist out there there are many flaws. My comment on this is \\"let us see you do a better job\\".

This alone is a major accomplishment. True, most of the modern celebration will be reconstructionist in essence. <br /> <br />The magical rituals are very handy, the recipies are delicious and I really like the idea of throwing another party in the middle of a blizzard!

The subject of magic has caused much controversy since beginningless time. Indeed people have been burnt for practicing it! We are now in an enlightend age when it can be done without fear of the inquisition at your door. This particular book uses my favorite tool for doing so; Tarot.   <br /> <br />I was skeptical in the past. I knew of this books existence since its publication. Now after many years later of meditation, I picked up the new edition with beautiful cover and tried one of the spells. It works perfectly and quickly. In my experience, we practice magic every day, from simple to complex wishes, and hopes. This book helps us focus more on getting what we need, rather than foolish desires. <br /> <br />It could be labled Wishcraft. New Age in concept, the application relays on nothing that has come before. I value this alone. Janina Renee obviously is well versed in the subject. I am sure she used all of the spells herself. I am also sure they all work! This develops self confidence as well as focusing on what you need!	2005-07-31

I had nightmares after reading the first few chapters regarding spirits following your cards. And the nonsense about reading for oneself is absolute rubbish! How can one one learn the cards?  Reading for drunks in a bar seems preferred. <br /> <br />As for the magic, there are many other books out there that provide safe and sane methods for your cards!

It was truly a breath of fresh air from the heaviness of the standard Rider-Waite of the time. Many clients would only have me read for them with the Hanson-Roberts deck. It works for most people because it is so fun to look at! The 7 of cups has always been my favorite card. <br /> <br />If one is beginning, this is the deck I recommend the most! It is inexpensive and comes with a great reference book. I would also say get a copy of the Universal Waite to cross reference. It is beautifully colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts as well.

At the time it was cutting edge with my taste. Very contempory in its presentation. I was simultaneously studying the Crowley-Thoth deck that Mr. Wanless wrote a great workbook for. His Voyager Tarot brought the Tarot into the modern age for myself and many others. This was the deck I began using to read for others. <br /> <br />The card were large and beautifully constructed of universal photography that seemed so profound then. This was just as the digital age was being born. There were no fancy programs to work with. It was truely a major feat at the time. Compliments were given to the cards alone, not my skills reading them! Alas, this was my college years. I was an art student. I had very little money and took them to a party. They were stolen in 1989! <br /> <br />For myself,I Hermetically sealed the deck as well as my current study of the Tarot. I kept reading with the Thoth Deck. After college, many years later I purchased another Photo-montage deck-The Cosmic Tribe Tarot. It was superior indeed! I decided to purchase another copy of the Voyager in 1999.  <br /> <br />Time can date our perception of what we consider beautiful or meaningful. That was the case with this particular Tarot. It had lost much of the mystical charm of just 10 years ago. The images are somewhat nostalgic and I do not use it for any professional work. Mr Wanless should try another deck with modern technology being what it is. There are many great photo decks out there. I  feel this one is just a little dated in its style.	2005-07-30

This is wonderfully clever in its representation of the dark fantasy world that lives on the periphery of all fans of the genre. I understand this could be taken the wrong way by many, but the title alone should be a warning. It would get a PG rating in theatres.  <br /> <br />There are vampires, gargoyles, mummies, and a plethora of ghostly images. The other decks done in this fashion seem to fall short on many aspects. Either they focus on one subject, namely vampires and that is it. Not the case with this dark treasury of the arcane.  The artist sways away from \\"kitsch\\", quite difficult in the gothic subculture.  <br /> <br />The deck itself remains loyal to classic Rider-Waite organization. There is some new wisdom provided as well. The overall mood here is is an old gothic horror movie set in some dark corner of Europe. One could imagine Gypsies in the wolfmans forest using these cards. If one reads in a professional setting it sould feature all the traditonal props; black velvet table cloth, a crystal ball and red and black candles.  <br /> <br />As for using the deck itself, reading are surprisingly accurate. I am particularly fond of the heavy use of Egyptian images. That is not all. All the minors have some illustration giving the meaning of the cards. Some ever so subtle. This makes it great for the beginner, as well as advanced. If this fits your style, then by all means get a copy of this darkly brilliant interpretation of a powerful tool. A word of caution here-the deck has a feeling of the spirit world being very close! No kidding!	2005-07-29

I purchased this deck when it was published many years ago and have used it ever since. This is often the most misunderstood of all decks. The divinatory meanings are all intact. I use it for my friends who are familiar with this mythology and like a more gentler presentation of the traditional meanings. This doesnt mean that they are toned down by any means. <br /> <br />The illustrations are soft and precise. The colors are subtle yet striking when need be. The artist is undoubtedly trained in this style that I have always admired! The symbols change a bit here; the bat=romantic love, Temperance is a meditating nun. The Devil is given a Buddist interpretation with a bull and horse holding chains. Truely a warning to be kind to animals.  <br /> <br />I only regret tossing aside my LWB years ago. It contains much information regarding the Chinese mythology presented here . I hopefully committed most of it to memory. The style and essence is definitely Chinese in essence, incorporating Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism as well as spirit worship. This is all done with a skillfull touch. <br /> <br />As for the cards themselves, they are smaller than average making it easy to shuffle and lay out in readings. The backs are very beautiful in red and gold with luck goddesses dancing on them. I have used mine so often, the gold has begun to wear away. Maybe it is time to get another deck.	2005-07-28

This has to be the finest tarot deck in many years! Finally, a tarot that focuses on Eastern European culture. I have always had a fascination with Prague and would love to visit the true Heart of Europe. Until I can do so, there is this great set of cards to take me there. One can almost hear Mozart playing at the concert house. <br /> <br />I have to say this is one of the best presentations for the tarot ever! The box is beautiful, the cardstock is heavier than most, and the accompaning book is done like a long lost magical sourcebook! Surely a collectors item as well as an important addition to the entire history of the tarot. <br /> <br />I have seen other collage decks and liked them, Cosmic tribe and the Tarot de Paris. I really love this one! It uses images that are found within the city and fit into the very essence of the tarot system. The Wheel of Fortune contains images from the clock tower that is a symbol of the city itself. I almost need a magnifying glass to see the detailing here. <br /> <br />There are no modern New Age themes used at all here. Technology is absent altogether. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I feel Prague is timeless! The meanings of the cards themselves have a very \\"old world\\" feel to them. Many seeming like postcards from the city itself.  <br /> <br />All of the traditional symbols that one would expect from a great Tarot are here. The standard Rider-Waite system is employed. There is a definite \\"Bohemian\\" accent here. This would be the deck one would expect to see in a Gypsy wagon or Alchemist house. I am very proud to have this deck in my personal possession. Luck as well, for each set is numbered in an addition of 3000.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-22

This version of a classic pack used for divination shoud be in all advanced and serious fans of tarots collection. It is the first time I worked with these images and I must say, reading with this deck gives very accurate reading. That is if one knows the meanings of the minors intuitively. They are not illustrated in this particular rendition.    I like the size of these cards and the backs have a definite appeal, recalling an older century. The cards are subtitled in Italian, with most other European languages included. The originals are in French only. This is probably a major factor in the particular edition being so popular on the continent and elsewhere. I really like the colors as well.    This deck is excellent for the serious student of the tarot. For centuries, it was the most popular tarot and first deck used for divination. It connects the serious student with the true history of the cards. A truely major accomplishment in European history!    The downside to this system is that the minor trumps are not illustrated which can be a deterrent to the beginner. Imagine that this was the only popular set available before the mass production of the Rider-Waite system! What a challenge to students and mystics to use memory alone.	2005-07-20

I have been studying this divination/meditation system for about a year now and still dont have all the card memorized. This is a difficult process for some! Tarot is my favorite system to study, as it is rich in symbolism and historical texture, and there are literally hundreds of decks to pick from.  <br /> <br />The reason this deck inspires me so is the subject matter-Fairies, both light and dark. A friend did a reading for me with it and I was impressed. Anna Franklin knows her stuff, indeed. Unlike most other fairie products on the market, this one uses Celtic mythology and clearly applies it to the wheel of the year.  <br /> <br />Each season in carefully matched with fairies and goblins. Not all images are pleasant, some are downright disturbing. I would introduce this set to children at an early age! Tales of boogeymen haunting dark forests can only inspire young minds and charm old minds once more! There is no nudity here, only beautiful and scary imaginary folk that seem to be very alive in our collective unconcious. <br /> <br />The author and artist have also published a tarot set previously. I prefer this set, as it ventures into uncharted territory! I will stress-this is not tarot! The cards are meant to be read with reversals as well as upright. The accompaning book clearly is a wealth of information regarding the subject. There are meditations for most cards and many different spreads that can be use not just for this deck. <br /> <br />The art is like a photo book of the fairy realm. Great for the mystically inclined, as well as an opened minded scholar. Someday I will be able to proudly use this deck in formal reading! Anna Franklin is one my favorite authors on this subject. A breath of fresh air in a world of would be magicians and best selling witches! If she and Elen Hawke would come to the States!      <br />	2005-07-19

This is the one and only book I learned the tarot from many moons ago. This was in fact, the only book to learn from for many years. I imagine this classic in the hands of anyone beginning to go through the basic meanings of the standard Rider-Waite images. This is the basis of most other packs. The meanings can also be applied to the Marseille deck. I do not advise one to begin with this system, as the minors are not illustrated.  <br /> <br />The contents give an overview of the basic history up to the 1970s of the history of the cards. The astrology information was very helpful, numerology was ok. I have never been a big fan of numerolgy for I personally feel is to be too simplistic. As for the Quaballa, this goes right over my head and always will. Maybe someday I will take an interest in this. I would probably start with this book! <br /> <br />Some of the information is a bit dated, but I am sure this perennial favorite will be relevant for many generations to come. If you plan on seriously studying the cards, I could not think of a better place to begin!	2005-07-18

I picked up a copy of this deck in 2003 and have used it off and on since. This was released in the U.S. from the great and often misunderstood tarot publisher Lo Scarabeo.    This in my opinion is their best deck. The illustrations spark ones imaginations no matter your age. This is not for everyone and the deck has nudity and some disturbing imagery. 12 and over please. The perfect age to use this deck is when you feel you need to get back in touch with your whimsical nature or inner child.    There are many images presented here that inspire and stimulate one to imagine the fairie realm as real. The Strength card depicts a spritely figure wrestling a frog and the Temperance card is a mermaid. The Tower shows an ant hill being destroyed. The artist himself appears as the Hermit. Very clever.    The minor cards are accurate as far as the traditional Rider-Waite references are concerned. This makes the deck easy to read from a seasoned users perspective. The court cards is where things get a little confusing. Astrological references are given inacurately if one follows traditional elements. This is either intentional to give the audience a playful feel for the fairies invoved or the artist had no previous or little background with the symbols.    Altogether, the deck looks great when put together. Some of the court card are spendid as far traditional refernces. The Queen of cups is flawless as some sort of water nymph. The queen of swords is strangely brutal with a severed head on her lap.    The very frugal booklet that accompanies the set is almost useless. Either it is a poor translation from the Italian or it is trying to be too esoteric and mysterious. There is no handy layout for the cards. What is given is not good for readings. There are plenty of books out there to help with this, or make your own up.    The cards speak for themselves with very little error. I really enjoythem when I am out in my garden. They have a very natural feel to them.	2005-07-17

I Feel that one of the greatest thing one can leave behind is something that may help future generations. Brian William's wonderful tarot deck has done this. He was a great scholar and artist who lived and died with the tarot on his mind. I unfortnately did not purchase this deck until 2004. Then, I see what a great gift he left behind. <br /> <br />I had little or no idea about the cards. I always felt they may be over my head with the philosophy of the Renaissance behind them. When they were first published, I opted for the Medieval Scapini Tarot. Both decks now hold a very special place in my Tarot library. They were published at a time when Tarot was just getting off the ground in the world. <br /> <br />These cards demonstrate his genius as a scholar and illustator. The cards follow traditional meanings as well as give new insight into the neo-classical ideal. The Human form in all its wonder is presented here for the skilled reader as well as beginner! <br /> <br />Mr Williams and his wonderful Tarot deck will live forever in the history of the tarot books. His booklet is filled with wonderful information as well. If you dont see this, I advise you to hit the history books! This Tarot as well as the Medieval Scapini goes to the source of the Tarot-Italy! If you want a good lesson in philosophy and art, refer to this deck!	2005-07-17

It was my 3rd set of card when I first began studying long ago. 1st was Rider-Waite, 2nd IJJ Swiss. This set the standard even in todays mass market of Tarot production. <br /> <br />I already had a strong foundation in astrology,(the Thoth deck specializes in this) and Egyptian Myth. This was all too easy to understand the occult depth. Then the ultimate assistant in reading is the minors have the meanings written out for you. How convenient for beginners and those bad with memorization!LOL! <br /> <br />The majors all hold deep meaning with many of life's lessons! The Chariot is colored so vibrantly and the Death card means business! The Universe is my personal favorite. <br /> <br />There has been much written about this deck. Most of which goes over my head.I am not a Thelemite or Golden Dawn practitioner. The philosophy goes over my head. Crowleys work in general is far out there! <br /> <br />It is my humble opinion that he left behind something that will last for years, maybe centuries to come. That is his wonderful Tarot deck. I simply refer to it as the Thoth. It shines, frightens and guides many around the world on a daily basis. What more could a reader ask for?	2005-07-13

Upon first glance, this deck looks like one of the most beautiful ever published. The major trumps all are faithful to traditional design. The colors are pastel and very sping time like. Hence the name \\"printemps\\". This was my choice for romantic oriented readings.    It is when we pass into the minors that things fall apart rather fast. I do not know if it was deliberate or lost in translation but the meaning of most cards are switched beyond recognition.     A big NO NO in my book! I could see if there was a deliberate reason for this. The accompaning booklet lacks little explaination for these changes. There was no book to accompany deck. Until one is produced, the deck sits in my Tarot cabinet,gathering dust. Only getting it out to show others the beautiful art work.    I would not recommend this to beginners. Even advanced readers may have some trouble explaining the blatant changes to most of the minors. Believe me, this happened to me. A major trump only reading would be very good for affairs of the heart.	2005-07-13

A book seller came up to me and said \\"I see you have the porno-tarot there. We should keep this locked behind the counter.\\" Well, needless to say this peaked my curiosity. It didnt look like porn... <br /> <br />I puchased a copy of this now classic and was amazed at the skill and analysis in this set. I was not impressed by previous photo collages from the past:The Voyager Tarot. It bas too busy and not skillfully done. This was not the case with this deck. I would almost say this was almost holographic in style. <br /> <br />Nudity is used here and I must admit the models are beautiful! There is no pornography here. If the ideal human form is considered so shameful, the negative responder should be in the 1950s or earlier!  There is a post-hippy psychedilic/techno feel going on here. The artist is based in San Francisco, after all.I absolutely love it.  <br /> <br />This is not another rewrite of the Rider-Waite deck, (how many of them are in current existence?) I found many correlations to the Crowly-Thoth deck. Bold and courageous in itself. I have yet to encounter many successful clones or tributes to this stand alone classic. Cosmic Tribe seems to pull this off and go a little further! I am sure Crowley and his fans would like this tribute. <br /> <br />The deck does contain many provocative images! The Lover card alone would raise hairs on many necks! There are 3 versions here-2 men,2 women and a man and woman. Ideal for diverse clients who may like to use either or. This brings me to my next issue. Reading for others. This is a deck aimed at a 12+ audience. Most Tarots are provocative already! Even the Mighty Crowly-Thoth has elements that could confuse, frighten and outright shock many!  If reading for a public audience, I would keep a spare P-G rated deck around for the morally prudish.  <br /> <br />All in all, if I had to pick the best deck to come out of the 1990s this would be it! \\"Locked up\\", indeed.	2005-07-12

First, the illuminated art nouveau design with its intricacies are superb! All 78 cards have more details in them than one could count!  I assume much of the work is hand drawn as well as computer enhanced. This just adds to the mysterious style of the cards themselves.  <br /> <br />The unique feature of the deck is the reversed meanings are all fully and cleverly presented in each card. This is an area I have never ventured into before. I always felt reversals were like reading books upside-down. It was not logical or recognizable to me as a therapist/psychic. If the cards fell reversed, I simply, sometimes awkwardly turned them back over. This is no longer the case with this deck. Reading reversals is now, ever so easy.  <br /> <br />For myself, this was like learning the tarot over again. Something we may need to do every so often, as professional readers. This set is easy to learn for beginners and advances readers alike. The images can be visually challenging due to the intricacies. A magnifying glass may be required at times! <br /> <br />Mr Wong has easily brought the Tarot into the next century. Gone are the superstions previously associated with this wonderful tool.  All the mysteries are still in tact. The theme is almost Science Fiction with a liberal dose of Fantasy. I did a few readings today and the depth has been taken to new levels. There are now 156 meanings easily accessible to readers and client alike! This will in my opinion become the standard for the future of the Tarot.	2005-07-12

Its more of a modern self help manual than on old grimoir.  <br /> <br />This is more of my style. Modern Witchcraft for a modern high tech world, right? Absolutely. Keep traditional elements in your spell casting as well. After all, this is the path of the future, while having its roots in prehistory.	2005-07-12

I must say Dorothy Morrison is not the best source to turn to when it comes to the Tarot. She has many books published on magic and witchcraft that I personally find offensive. I feel she is a qualified magic user, but lacks enchantment in her technique.     This pack seemed a good idea at first- using classical fairy tales and nursery rhymes to illustrate a tarot deck. Well, she neglected all of the elements that make the Tarot so effective in readings. Every fairy story has its share of monsters, ogres and evil witches in them. There is very little darkness here. Simply unforgivable in a traditional Tarot.     I think there are many packs out there that could appeal to children.  The Hanson-Roberts deck is one of them. This persons illustrations are not justified with such banal concepts. The Tarot is not meant to spoon-feed egos of fluffy bunny would be witches. That is just what this set does.     Her book on Tarot magic recommends flushing cards down the toilet. I wonder if she used this deck to do so?	2005-07-12

Much of is is covered in the first volume. This is more than a \\"how to be a witch\\". This title has great information on chakra work and meditation techniques. Ms Hawke has one slight misconception about Buddhism. <br />Buddhist honor the world as well. They consider human life precious and literally wait to enter liberation until all others are free from suffering. This is fine. I have been practicing Tibetan Buddhism as well as western witchcraft for the past several years <br /> <br />These paths are really rather similar for the most part. As Westerners, we need to be aware of where we come from. Witchcraft is the best place to start. Maybe a few more generations will evolve a Western school of Buddhism that combines the paths. <br />This is not meant to be a debate on the philosophy schools. Meditation is great for Westerners. At this point in the game, a good lesson in non-violence could be learned. <br /> <br />Magic with good intentions cannot hurt anyone. This is where many of my comrades fall into a major debate. Reflection and calm abiding meditation do great. It makes one a great Visualizer/Spell Caster as an added bonus.  <br /> <br />The book is a must have for all witches here in the States. I recommend all of Elen Hawke's titles with high regard.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-12

I eagerly anticipated this set and can honestly say I was not disappointed. Rare in this supermarket of \\"new interpretations\\" of a standard, simple pack of cards. I am a serious collector and Tarot enthusiast, as well as a professional reader. This classy production is worthy for all! <br /> <br />I have no background or interest in Druidry previously. Simply for the fact that there is very little out there on this obscure subject. The author of this set is a practicing and seemingly skilled Druid. I once viewed modern Druids as a bunch of \\"tree huggers\\". This is no longer the case. This path hold much water with lots of relevance to our modern environmental crisis. <br /> <br />I must say there is much to be learned from this set. Not much new to skill card readers, although, there is some new insight here.  The interpretation of the court cards is very unique and exciting! I love the art of the Majors as well! Many years and painstaking execution went into each card. This is obvious! Art as Tarot. Hand crafted, meaningful art as well. <br /> <br />There is some nudity here. I would refrain from using the set for modest types. It does work well as a divinatory tool, but best as a meditation device. The cards are large and so well crafted that one may want a bigger edition.        <br />            <br />There are many different sets out there for most tastes, I am happy with this one, just for the artistic honesty alone. Its not out of the question for Tarot purist like myself.	2005-07-11

It is an art guide, history book, architecture study, travel guide and more. <br /> <br />What more could there be?  This is an excellent reference all around. Its easy to research a novel from this tome alone. I felt that I stepped off a plane and had an excellent english speaking tour guide with me.     <br /> <br />I naturally proceeded to get the rest of the set of travel guides. It was better than all the encyclopedias I had in school. The benefit of this series is that unless the world changes dramatically, the travel guides will not go out of style of years to come.	2005-07-09

No nonsense, and personable writing style, Ms Hawke strikes a deep chord in me. She is the real deal in the U.S. market filled with authors who think they can tell you a thing or two about the modern craft.  <br /> <br />There are a few authors here state side who understand magic. However, there is no tradition of initiated witches. Forget hereditary witchcraft.  Initation and actual commitment to the path means so much more to me. There is nothing wrong with American hedgewitchery. There is a risk of spiritual arrogance and some pompous attitudes. <br /> <br />This volume sums up the path without getting too preachy or complicated. Based in Oxford, England, I can easily see her as an instuctor at Hogworts Academy. Yet this is not a fantasy. This is real Wicca from a real English witch! What an affinity I feel for this lady. Makes me want to move there! <br /> <br />In this world of American everything, this is a breath of fresh air. The greatest export the Celtic Isles has to give the world is the dynamic belief system of modern Wicca. It is quickly the fastest growing religion in the world, simultaneously the oldest. Ms Hawke Brings this path to light like no other with her gentle and magical style <br /> <br />I feel that this brand of spirituality will spread the globe over and environmental based thinking will become more accepted in our world of corporate churches. England, probably still has its problematic witch-hunters. Im sure it is nothing compared to our new world American Inquisition. <br /> <br />The Basics are reviewed for many. I feel I have been practicing with Elen and her Coven. I have grown more comfortable in my English-style cottage garden. Our winter is a little more severe here in Ohio. Other than that, I feel a deep affinity with this woman and her brand of witchery. You may also.	2005-07-09

I have always been fascinated by the legend of King Arthur. This artist clearly has devoted a great deal of time and effort into this project. She is undoubtedly successful.  <br />  <br />As a Tarot for divination, I would not recommend this particular pack. For the collector and Arthurian buff this is superb!  Especially the book Keeper of Words. There seem to be some common thread here with the basic mythology and the traditonal tarot. As with many themed decks, this is historically disproven. <br />Interesting observation on the authors behalf. <br /> <br />The Major Tumps are wonderfully matched with key figures in the Legend. Ms. Ferguson has done an excellent job with this Arthur as the emperor is a given. Morgan La Fey as the Moon is sublime. The colors are all blues, purples and gray giving the overall quality a very otherworldly, sleepy feel. <br /> <br />There is a dark side to this deck. I do not professionally read with this set because it has many dark overtones. This may be fine for some. The backs are not the best in design as well. I would recommend a reprint with a more intricate Celtic motif. These cards themselves are rather flimsy and may chip after numerous readings. No direct fault of the artist. <br /> <br />Maybe it is the Legend itself, it is a nice myth, but should not be used for divination or spiritual seeking. I believe I see the Legend in a new light. It is not a positive one.  We find a mishmash of Roman, Pagan Celtic and early Christian all tossed together in a French fairie tale. This says a lot to me. I still like the story. It is more romantic with Ms. Fergusons translation and illustration. It is also interesting to note the she has an illustrated edition of La Morte D'Arthur. This is an excellent companion as well. Perhaps in the future, we can look forward to an animated big screen adaptation by the artist herself.	2005-07-09

Art and Tarot decks go hand and hand. How can I be happy with this set? The colors!The intention! <br /> <br />Watercolor illustrations do not give great details but his Tarot is great when one puts ones skill with color interpretation in a reading. This is a deck that could have been the greatest Celtic themed deck ever. The accompaning book is very informative on Irish folklore. I have a deep affinity with these themes. <br /> <br />This is the great mythology of Northwestern Europe! The Major Trumps are all accurate as far as tradition is concerned. Based on the Rider-Waite system. The minor are great as well. Maybe just a little better in there meaning. I would not suggest this to a beginner because of lack of detail. Color on the other hand is vibrant and really conducive to \\"psychic-oriented\\" readings. A major factor in not totally writing off this deck.  <br /> <br />Maybe it is the intention of the author/illustrator to give a primative feel to the illustrations. This set will undoubtedly go out of print soon and be long forgotten by the serious tarot audience. I will use it regardless. The cardstock is heavy, and the backs are very nice. Get a copy for posterity. <br /> <br />Someday this may be a collectible...	2005-07-09

The romance and legend of early occultist have given rise to the theory that the Tarot as we know it today came from the land of Egypt! Nothing could be farther from the truth or dearer to my heart! <br /> <br />I would love to think that this vast and ancient culture could have left something so significant to modern civilization. This proved not to be the case, much to my disappointment! Many still hold Egypt in high regard in many Tarot circles. Clive Barrett was undoubtedly one of them. These images he creates are beautiful and magical. <br /> <br />This set clearly give some insight into this colorful and mysterious culture. If there was any possible way to bring this world to life through the Tarot, this would be it. I particularly like the references to the Egyptian Gods(Neteru). This set is great for revival Egyptophiles! Use the images alone for meditation and more. The book is excellent as well! <br /> <br />The Tarot may not have historically came from Egypt but there are many common element between the two styles. Mainly, the use of symbolism which may not be directly related, but there is a connection.  I recommend this set for scholars and mystics alike!  <br /> <br />Now, I eagerly await the re-release of Mr Barrett's legendary and elusive Norse Tarot!	2005-07-08
US	36954186	R2Y7J8WHUGSC5M	1572810408	436802546	Old English Tarot	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Warm Summer Deck	There seems to be nothing short of a warm summer afternoon to describe this deck. I particularly like this Tarot in that regard. It is true, there are not a lot of occult, mystical references here but it is very user friendly by client standards.  <br />  <br />Many decks scream at clients as the cards are turned.  This is not one of them. The subtle tones and warm colors lend to this calm feel-a big plus for many who have had customers squirm at various decks.  I would recommend this for kids as well. The images are obvious, but not threatening. Ms Kneen illustrates for childrens books as well. <br /> <br />I use this deck for folks who have stressful issues facing them. The colors are soothing, yet the images are not too soft. This deck has a very agrarian feel to it. Many of the minor trumps depict pastoral scenes, which could be used for folks asking about gardening or farming. Do not feel limited to this purpose alone! In skilled hands, this deck can be consulted on all issues. <br /> <br />Many reviewers here and elsewhere had said this Tarot lacks something. Occult references, I believe, were left out on purpose. The overall feel of the deck becons one back to the Middle ages.  I could see this as being as an intermediate deck for someone who has had some experience with this particular system of divination. The Tarot is not for everyone to read. It is a fine art, that needs many years of practice to perfect.	2005-07-08

It is as if the illustrators original intention were upgraded to perfection! Ms Coleman-Smith must be proud where ever she is! These images are probably the most common for anyone seeing the Tarot for the first time. I remember picking up the original in 1986. I was afraid and interested at the same time.     Now, all these years and decks later, this wonderful edition appears. Perusing it, I felt an old freind reborn. I felt hurt and ashamed that there are individuals out there who would use this wonderful tool to profit off and harm others! So I began reading publicly again in 2002. This deck can revive faith and trust in my clients.    Not only are these cards to be used for professional readings, they are great for meditation and pathworking. The reinterpretation of the color scheme makes this very effective on all accounts. Gone are many fears and superstions associated with the history of this deck. The mysteries are still there for those of you who favor this.     Mary Hanson-Roberts has another pack out there that is as faithful to this edition. However, I feel this deck is superior in many ways. Many use the mystical power of color in a reading. I cannot recommend a more conducive deck for this purpose.     Beginners take note, the booklet included has all standard meanings associated with this system. It is like learning musical notes before you can compose your symphony. Very important!  Then develop your skills further by actually reading for family and friends. Who know what could be in store for you! Most importantly, keep your sense of humor.     If necessary, move on to another deck to suite your style. There are many to pick from, so if this is not your style, try something more suited to yourself. There are many instrument in an orchestra. This is one of the truest methods for developing intuitive or psychic skills! If this does not work for you at first, set it aside and come back to it later!If I could give this ten stars, I would! Tarot is evolving from a superstitious fortune telling device, to the ever loyal assistant to the skilled counselor! This interpretation is where many begin! Think, feel and intuition can begin to show.	2005-07-08

This was ordered after many request on my behalf to get user friendly deck for my clients! This was it! I already have and use over   25 different sets to pick and choose from.  The art was irresistible and nostalgic. I love the presentation as well as the design. Smooth, easy to handle cards with great backs(very important to me). Simple and effective.     Needless to say, my clients loved them! The majors and minors are all accurate with traditional systems. There is modern \\"retro\\" interpretations that are simple to translate in a reading. For instance, the High Priestess is a bottle of syrup! Even traditionally threatening cards such as death(a Jar of spoiled Mayo) or the Devil(chocolate cake) take on this easy to handle meaning.    The nostalgia takes me back to an age a little before my time.  Tarot was not used at all. Now its a household word in many circles!  Imagine if this deck was around in the 1940s and 50s. It would have revolutionized life.  I dont believe any sort of fortune telling was done then. Maybe palmistry or tea leaves?  Undoubtedly, it was suspect. Thank the Stars for the dawning of the age of Aquarius!:-)!!!!    Here we are today! Get this deck if not for converstion alone!

This was a very special moment in my life being a Buddist and Tarot reader for many years as well. I anticipated this set for months. I was waiting for the missing link in the clouded history of the Tarot. I was sure this was going to be it! Wrong was I. Or maybe the Fool again.<br /><br />Overall this is a well done set with a lot of careful research into both histories eastern and western. The cards were very nice to handle as well as the size. The majors carefully and accurately depict the life of the Buddha.  The similarities were uncanny. This is where my facination ended.<br /><br />The greatest hurdle with this deck is reading for others. Most Tarots leave out religious references. The original images dating from the middle ages perhaps were giving some sort of dramatic lesson that has been clouded by time. This is irrelevant to modern Tarot therapist. The Buddhas enlightenment is not to be used as an example for divination. My Buddist clients likes the pictures, but couldnt relate to traditional interpretations. I wouldnt consider using this deck for non-Buddist practioners. There is just too much confusion and a lot of explaining.<br /><br />This Tarot is an important study deck for many this art develops.  Maybe in the future there will be a clearer depiction of these two important esoteric schools!	2005-07-02
US	36954186	R37B0UA9SI801G	0738705209	270132973	The Gilded Tarot (Book and Tarot Deck Set)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Almost Perfect!	This deck was published last year and the last thing I need is another deck. Well, I broke down and picked up a copy and loved the streamlined feel of it. The astrological references were great and I found the figures beautiful.  The style was done with electronic graphics which, I personally feel takes away some of the humanism from all art.  I draw and paint by hand. I hope this is not a trend!    However, the package is attractive and the accompaning book by Barbara Moore takes the Tarot to its next level and removes much fear and stigma associated with this beautiful art of divination and wisdom! Her reference is great for beginner and old readers alike. I was able to get some new insight here. A rare commodity in todays spiritual mega-mall!    I unpacked the cards, consecrated them to helping others  and took them to my group meeting and the response was amazing!  The was no question to the readings as the meanings are traditional that is a big advantage. My friends loved the art and being that I read for them frequently, they requested this pack first!    By all means this is a must buy if you need to refresh your perspective on this great way of opening a party or social event!	2005-06-30
US	36954186	R1KIO2H7K0NEE9	1572814780	187500841	The Medieval Scapini Tarot: Deck and Book Set	Books	5	39	41	N	N	Major Addition to any collection!!!	This tarot deck is one of the finest in print!  It was one of the first packs I began learning from in 1986.  It is replete with all the occult trapping and mysterious images one could look for.  There is one difference from other tarots of a similar nature-it has this brilliant sense of humor!  The tarot is like an oil lamp. It can either light your way, or burn down your house. This particular pack offers the protection of laughter in a reading, which I find so relevant.  <br />    The details here are too numerous to mention. One can almost sense the mist rising from the Moon card, or feel the warmth in the Strength card. The Minors are so highly detailed that I am still noticing various flora and fauna. The backs are always important as welll.  These are of a gilt goldtone that dont wear away after years of use.  <br />    If you are looking to branch out with your mystical dabblings and wish to give your reading new flash, look no further! This is my most recommended pack for beginners and intermediaries alike. Very little nudity,  so this would be fine for clients of all ages!	2005-06-12

This was one of those decks that came out after the Tarot geyser began spewing a new deck each month, so I initially ignored it.  Many years later I was to pick up a copy after my tarot revival and was pleasantly surprised. This deck is wonderful as far as the traditional meanings are concerned.     As far as the updates to new meanings are concerned-referring to the archetypal Rider-Waite style-I was very happy with Death becoming the Close and Judgement becoming Karma. How insightful and modern. The major Trumps all ring musical insight into my readings.    That brings me to my problems with this Pack. The minor trumps fall short.  For starters, there are no ethnic repesentations here. True, this design is specifically based on European pagan traditions. Pagans are all caucasian, right?  Anyway, that is beside the point. These minors lack the depth of the majors. I do like the Flower language referred to in them.    Never the less, this deck is an important addition to any collection. The colors are conducive to a warm summer afternoon suited for readings and meditation. Young beginners would find this an excellent launching pad for occult dabblings of all sort. Green gardening, outdoor full moon rites...	2005-06-10
US	36954186	R1NHISQB6475LY	0380720191	164215595	The List of Seven	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Bring on some more...	I read this book back when it was first published and was totally swept away in this wonderful tribute to a genre I couldnt get into before-Victorian Era London. This is not your grandparents detective story.  <br />    The supernatural elements were all there as well a well researched historical facts. I loved it. I was rapidly swept accross the British landscape with little disruption. then the climax was eerie and stunning! <br />     I liked the sequel-6 Messiahs. But then it stopped.  I was waiting for the Hollywood treatment with Gary Oldman as the star, but this never happened either. Maybe it was too dark or too old fashioned for todays audience. Come on, Mr. Frost-give me the next installment this year!        <br />	2005-06-05
US	36954186	R23XH0AHBBWHO8	088079965X	447420419	The Halloween Tarot	Books	5	1	1	N	N	great halloween fun	This has been one of my favorite decks for many years. I only use this for personal readings, however dont hesitate using it professionally! It is especially fun during Halloween.    The standard Rider Waite system is used so I would refer beginners as well as advanced readers. It is simply charming. I love the colors: Black, varied oranges,dark green and brown.   I just wished the artistry were a bit more deep.    Well wait a minute, it is done in the style that speaks of late October nights, full moons and gleeful youths running through the night.       Before your next halloween party-GET A COPY!!!	2004-01-27
US	36954186	RAQCON9R9DMTW	0312304226	968936687	Tarot de Paris	Books	5	3	3	N	N	!like an archeological discovery-spendid!!!	I purchased this set last fall and couldnt wait to open it. Alas, I was disappointed upon finding flimsy production of the cards and stone cold images. I set it aside and proceeded to other sets I was working with.  Now several months later I picked up the beckoning blue box and felt a deep and profound connection.  I visited Paris in 1987. I began reading the Tarot a year previously. I seen the \\"old cards\\" in the Louvre and loved them but my desire for the cards diminished. I wanted a definitive deck.    Now, years down the road I feel I have found that missing link.  These images are nothing short of museum pieces. Yet the metaphysical scope runs deep. I did a reading for myself and felt that I found an old companion. Gone were my doubts and I knew I had a powerful tool in my grasp. The card are wonderful for meditation as well as consultation. I am planning to use them for my main public instruction. Bravo-J Philip Thomas for creating this masterwork and hopefully the next perennial favorite for many generations to come.	2004-01-27
