The principles outlined in this little book are sound and needed, but ultimately the book falls very short of the intended goal of equipping a Christian for spiritual warfare.  A text on the subject would have to at least be three times the depth of this book.  Very little practical advise was given on the day-to-day activities that constitute spiritual warfare.<br />I gave Hanegraaff a few stars for successfully debunking the deliverance ministry nonsense that has taken the evangelical movement by storm.  I took a few away for the aforementioned reasons and that Hanegraaf's demonology is a little suspect on certain points.<br />If you want good books regarding Demonology, try:<br />Biblical Demonology, by. Merrill F. Unger, Th.D., Ph.D. (The standard work in Conservative circles.)<br />The Powers of Evil, by. Sydney H.T. Page (An incredibly well documented book on Satanic powers.)<br />As to a proper interpretation of the \\"armor of God\\" found in Ephesians, there are simply to many good resources to list.

This is nothing short of a magnum opus for Richard Abanes.  I do not remember the last time I read a text so thoroughly researched than this tome. Every point of historical importance, every modicum of doctrine and ultimately every facet of Mormonism is covered and thoroughly analyzed.<br />Abanes was fair in criticizing those non-Mormons who acted wrongly in their dealings with Mormons.  At the same time he didn't flinch when it came time to expose the decades of deceit, violence, lawlessness, civil disobedience, sexual perversion, false theology, blatant racism, sexism, and outright brigandage perpetrated by the Mormon church.  Just beneath the smiling face of Mormonism lurks a heritage of evil and a belief system so flawed that it defies the basics of human reason.<br />The author did a fantastic job of describing the origins or Mormons and chronicled Joseph Smith's rise from obscurity to a self-proclaimed \\"Prophet.\\"  The analysis of how the Book of Mormon came in to being was particularly interesting.  Far from being the divine revelation of God, the work is a pure fabrication spliced together from a variety of secular and religious text from the era.  <br />Each phase of the churches growth was described in a complete manner.  I was surprised to find that the position of trying to pass off Mormonism as a denomination of Christianity is rather new (circa early-1990s).<br />I took one star away from this book for Abanes' completely lackluster explanation of Biblical polygamy. The contrast between Mormon polygamy and that as practiced by Biblical figures is well defined and enlightening.  However, Abanes chose to simply ignore the more difficult passages of the Bible that seem to support polygamy and instead gave the canned Evangelical answer to the subject.  It was odd seeing this tired rehash of cobbled together theology in an otherwise spectacular work.<br />In short, this book is not to be missed.  I would go so far as to say every American should read this book.  More importantly, every practicing member of the Mormon church should read a copy immediately.  Their very soul may depend upon it.	2003-05-14

This is a good addition to the library of someone studying the Old Order or 'plain people' groups.  I have yet to find a more thorough breakdown of the different types of clothing worn by the four main branches of Old Order Anabaptist sects.<br />On the down side, the writing was not particularly well done and there were a few typographic errors.

The author does a good job of giving an overview of the four different Old Order groups covered in the book.<br />Though the author was slightly slanted in favor of some of the Old Orders (Brethren & Amish mainly), this book had neither the rose-colored fluff or scathing condemnation of other publications. There was a description of what worked, what didn't work, what was pious and what was wrong with all four groups.<br />I would like to have know more intricate detail of each of the group's theology rather than a few snippets of scriptural interpretation and comments from church fathers. I do, however, understand that this book is more of a sociological survey than a theological analysis.<br />The last few chapters did engage in a repetitious rehash of what has already been covered. I also did find a few typographic errors that didn't get caught by the editor. <br />Final analysis: If you are new to studying any of these groups, this could certainly would play as a good jumping-off point for further study. If you need to get a quick overview of the groups mentioned, this would also serve your purpose. A more thorough study, however, will require additional reading and research.	2003-01-04

The writing was very thorough and the pages were lavishly filed with quality color photos.  Most every aspect of owning, safely using and maintaining muzzleloaders were covered.  Hunting with these unique weapons was of course covered in detail.<br />The book was a little slanted toward the \\"modern\\" muzzleloader crowd.  While I am less interested in this, I can understand why this would be a hot topic to many hunters.  The person who co-authored this book, Tony Knight, is credited with starting this phenomenon in the 1980s.<br />This is great introduction and I would highly recommend it for someone interested in the sport.  It will certainly serve as a jumping off point for further study.  For some, however,  it may be the only book you need on the topic.	2003-01-01

This book only had a little information I found useful. If the prospective reader was a complete novice with firearms, it would be much more helpful. Anyone who has done research on the subject won't find much new here.<br />On the positive side, it did have a nice article on carry technique for law enforcement officials and those who are legally licensed to do so. These little arms present their own challenges for safe carry. The sections on personal safety was decent though a little alarmist.<br />The chapter entitled \\"Buyer's Guide: Evaluation and Specifications of Recommended Pocket Pistols,\\" was laughable. First, there was absolutely no \\"evaluation\\" of the performance of the arm. Only the physical specifications are given. Secondly, it only covered six manufacturers of which at least two (and possibly a third) are no longer in business. At least one of these has been out of business for a very long time; strange for a book published in 2001. There is a plethora of high-quality arms of this type that had no mention. Even though the author only limited the selection to American-made arms, I can think of half-dozen others to add. Almost all of them, frankly, are better than the ones found in this book.<br />This is a subject that badly needs to be covered and covered well. I'm not sure that this book quite does it.	2002-11-27

If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom. <br />The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.<br />I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.<br />Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else.	2002-11-26

The back cover of this reprint says \\"a novel of fear from the author of Dracula.\\"  Amazon has reprinted their statements.  This book is probably Stoker's most well known ROMANCE books.  Why the publisher is trying to pass this off as a horror novel is beyond me.<br />Now, the review.  Though I never read romance, I really liked this book.  I have been a fan of Stoker since I can remember and this is certainly a good one.  It is interesting to read him in a totally different genre.  The characters are similar to his other characters, but there a few additional types that are refreshing and enjoyable.<br />Final analysis:  If you are a Stoker fan, this is a must to read.  If you like Victorian-Edwardian literature, this is also a good one.  This would also be good, I suppose, for someone who likes romances that doesn't want all the modern vulgarities in the mix.	2002-06-06

This is a good basic book about wifely submission.  In a straight-forward manner the author lays out the do's and don'ts of submission.  Most of the examples are good practical advise and help to expose how easy it is to get the marriage roles out of alignment.  While this book is for women, it doesn't let men off the hook either when it comes to their responsibilities.  I look forward to what my wife thinks of the book.<br />The reason for my removing of a few stars was because of the authors total glossing over of a rather tough topic in Christian submission:  What to do if asked to do something immoral or illegal.  Rather than tackle the difficult issue, the author simply gives some examples of how it all worked out in the end.  That's all well and good, but in the real world that rarely happens.<br />Ask any mainline pastor or theologian and they will tell you that a wife need not obey a directive from the husband to sin or to break the law of the land.  While it is true that Ephesians instructs women to obey their husbands, it also commands men to love their wives as Christ loved the church.  Would Christ command the church to sin?  No way.	2002-05-23

This was a very interesting and informative read.  The author had clearly done his homework.  Instead of propping up his personal and/or denominational agenda, he gave equal play to various interpretations.  At the same time, he would explain why a particular interpretation was strained or altogether wrong.<br />I have yet to find a better Biblical exploration of the subject of demonology.  Far to often such books are full of paranoia, speculation, and extra-biblical quotations.  This was a well-grounded and scholarly approach to one of the tougher subjects in Christian theology.  Favorable consideration should be given \\"Powers of Evil.\\"	2002-05-14

This is a nice little succinct book that breaks down those things that hinder the Christian walk.  It is divided into two categories:  Giants (that which are *huge* obstacles) and Thorns (not obstacles, but the little things that chaff, bother, annoy and wear you down).<br />The book is full great Biblical advise and is devoid of the bland platitudes that generally plague this type of Christian literature.<br />Be warned on two accounts though.  First, you *will* find yourself saying, &quot;yup, that's me,&quot; a lot.  Secondly, this book can be a &quot;downer.&quot;  If you are looking for a happy-sappy pickup, look elsewhere.

This was a pretty decent read and I am happy to include it in my library.  While I rate the 'Code of the Samurai' and the 'Art of War' on a much higher level, this book is not without it's merits.<br />I haven't read other translations, so I can't really comment on the quality of this one.  However, the introductory material suffered from quite a few mistakes.  Commas were missed, the improper use of a/an was found at least once and even the word 'then' was misspelled.  This wouldn't be allowed in a college term paper;  it should have been caught in a mass market publication.<br />As to the quality of the book for it's knowledge alone, I would break it down by who the prospective reader is:<br />Kendo Artist:  This is a must.  No ifs, ands or buts.<BR>Other Martial Artist:  Highly recommended, but not necessary.<BR>Soldier:  Recommended, but take it with a grain of salt.<BR>Businessperson:  Read it only if you are curious.	2002-02-08

The author seems to have researched his material pretty well. I took away a few stars for two reasons. One, this book is rather dated having been published in the mid-80s. If you are looking for an up-to-date publication, this probably won't do it for you. Secondly, the chapter on Wicca was pretty bad. It basically allowed two professed witches get on their soapbox and preach away. While this is very informative, some kind of counterpoint would be helpful. Furthermore, the witches in question did NOT (unlike the author) back up their claims with any kind of verifiable evidence. Twice they claimed that Exodus 22:18 was somehow placed in there by a (unnamed) Pope. A beginning seminary student could tell you that there is ample evidence that the text of Exodus pre-dates the papacy by a very long time. All and all this was a decent book with a very readable style.	2001-08-28

As my title suggests this is a pretty decent overview of Islam.  It is not an in depth look at all facets of the Islamic faith, but it is its a good dissection of the faith's core values.<br />While Muslim apologists are sprouting all over the 'net, it's good to have some balance to their rhetoric.  The Qur'an and Hadith, despite what they will have you believe, are filled with violence, hatred, racism, misogynistic rants and blatant contradictions.  Understanding what the Qur'an and Hadith is all about can help you not only understand what's going on in the Middle East, but your Muslim neighbors.<br />I took away a few stars because the author would continually cite personal conversations with various Muslims.  I don't believe this is credible enough evidence.  After all, how many times have various kooks claimed to be Christian and their words taken as being orthodox thought?<br />Lastly, I would say this book is a good addition to an Christian's library.  I would also suggest getting a copy of the Qur'an and Hadith if you do a lot of witnessing to Muslims.  If the Christian is interested only affirming that Islam is a false faith, you don't need this book.  Just the fact that it denies the deity of Christ, the Trinity, the authority of the Bible and salvation through Grace is plenty of evidence of that.<br />God bless.	2001-07-31

While it contains many of Stoker's previous themes, this is a departure into a more action-oriented story.<br />As with all his books, the first few chapters are slow, but it builds up eventually.  I especially enjoyed that beautifully written descriptions of the &quot;Land of the Blue Mountains&quot; and her inhabitants.  The wedding scene is also wonderful.<br />The only thing that I didn't like was the incredibly dry and boring chapter that was devoted to the main character's Uncle's will.

It is without a doubt a desecration of a classic.  If you are going to write a sequel to or &quot;borrow&quot; characters form a classic, you must tread lightly.  In this case the author tap-danced over Dracula.<br />First there are some gross contradictions to the original.  Everything from how/who dispatched Dracula to Mina's baby.<br />Unfortunately that's not the worst of it.  All the original characters are re-written.....for the worse.  Jonathan becomes a greedy workaholic, Van Helsing a neurotic old kook and Dr. Seward somehow doubts the existence of vampires (after Dracula??).  By far the worst character is that of the title character - Mina!  No longer is she the virtuous, intelligent and strong woman of Stoker's making.  She becomes a lying, duplicitous, slutty, selfish, and otherwise despicable alcoholic whiner.<br />Ultimately this book fails to deliver.  Both as a sequel to the great novel Dracula, or as a book on it's own.  If it was the latter, it would have a few merits, but not enough to warrant more than two stars by any stretch of the imagination.<br />My recommendation:  Skip this one!!	2001-05-27

A library of his works wouldn't be complete without a copy.<br />On the other hand, this is arguably his worst work of fiction.  It was his last finished novel and his declining mental and physical condition is evident in the disjointed writing style.  While I somewhat enjoyed the surreal nature of the work, other readers might become incredibly annoyed by it.  I wouldn't blame them either.<br />To summarize, if you are a fan of Stoker, pickup a copy.  If not, you might as well skip it.	2001-02-15

I really love Bram Stoker's writing and this would have to be my second favorite book of his (Dracula being the first of course).<br />Though the pace is slow compared to modern writing, the descriptions are wonderful.  The characters are standard Stoker men and women.  I have to admit I like them, even if they are a bit over melodramatic in nature.<br />The only thing I didn't like was the ending, which left to many questions in the air.<br />Either way, I recommend this book.  If you are a fan of Stoker, definitely purchase a copy.  If you are looking for a change in horror fiction or are interested in this periods writing, I'd recommend it too.	2001-02-15

This book has some real pros and some real cons.  The *majority* of the advice given is practical, no nonsense etiquette.  For this reason I would heartily recommend this publication to a gentleman looking to improve upon such areas in his life.  There are other books however that he should supplement his learning, in my opinion.<br />Now, having said that, there are some glaring problems w/ this book.<br />I.) The suggestion that a man should NEVER turn down an invitation is nuts.  The author gave the reader the out in the event of illness or death in the family.  Come on, there are times, for whatever reason, that you have to respectfully decline.<br />2.) Drink beer from a CAN!?!  How did that slip in there?  First, at a truly formal occasion you simply don't suck down the suds.  At any other occasion it is more than acceptable, but how hard is it to put it in a glass?  Drinking beer from a can in your living room by yourself (or w/ your wife) after a long hard week, sure that's fine, but elsewhere drink from a glass.<br />3.) There is one point that states simply, &quot;If a gentleman can afford to do so, he should have someone else clean his home.&quot;  Why?  There is a fine line between snobbery and etiquette and this crossed it.  If it said if the man and his wife are to busy to keep a house clean, then that would make a lot of practical sense.  Otherwise, it's a waste.<br />4.) The other gives the reader full liberty to not wear socks in many occasions, but says w/o question he must wear a undershirt.  Though I live in the North and always wear the two aforementioned articles, I could see why a gentleman from Dixie would not want to wear an undershirt during the summer.  Socks are a must, IMHO.<br />5.) The quib about always bringing condoms was both out of place and inappropriate in my opinion.  Such sexual matters are both personal and vary depending on a gentleman's religious background.  It didn't belong in this book.<br />Good day.	2001-02-02

The simple, straight-forward layout covers the major bases for a new convert looking to fill in some blanks.  Anyone involved in a ministry may find it a great  book to hand out.	2000-03-27

As the subject line suggests this is a great book for getting Linux set up on your system. Linux setup can be a pain, but having a guide like this is a good idea.<br />However, beyond the installation the author covers very little. The is absolutely very, very little on Linux networking. Frankly that's the main reason someone may want to deal with Linux.  The enclosed CD has an antique version of RedHat.<br />Also, in a desperate attempt to be trendy some of the side bar articles are completely useless (ie 'Polish Connection', 'Alternative CD uses', etc.) They were out of place and a complete waste of time.  The standard 'For Dummies' jokes are fine, but it should at least have something to do with the subject.<br />There are a few technical errors, such as claiming NT isn't a multi-user OS (!) and a few minor hardware misprints.<br />Bottom line: Great book to get you installed and started. Not a book to get for a serious reference.	2000-01-01

It covers basic auto repair and care with a straight forward approach.  All the resources and pictures really came through. I now keep a log of all my truck work, and it hasn't run  better.<br />The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because of  gross oversight in the &quot;driving ecologically&quot; section.  The  author advised NOT to warm up a car before taking off in the morning.  Even  us &quot;dummies&quot; know that 90% of all engine wear  occurs during  start up and hopping in a cold car and zooming off is a very bad piece of  advice.  I also seriously doubt a 2min. warm up has a lot of effect on the  environment.<br />Either way, a great book.  I would recommend buying it.	1999-12-27
