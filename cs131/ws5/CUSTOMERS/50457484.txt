This is an especially poignant book for mothers who must face life changing decisions. The writing was smooth and the book read well. I would highly recommend this to those who enjoy memoirs. Lee writes about the life of her grandmother and family members who live through some very difficult times. This one will stay on my shelf and I look forward to reading more of Lee's books.	2004-03-03

It is amazing to think that people like this exist and I am often reminded of that fact when in public with those not all \\"there.\\" Amazing to think that the doctor did not get the trouble early on and that the children were allowed to roam witoout adult supervision. This was a great read especially if you have children and take good care of them. The homosexuality was not surprising in the least and it was good to see that Augusten managed to stay relatively sane in the environment tainted with mentally ill adults.	2004-01-17

This book's main character is a male and I found that her characterization of females is much more interesting than males. The tale told here was well done but not the best of her work. I enjoyed the many colorful characters and would have preferred a book about Olga.	2003-05-12

It also reminds those who do have children that life does have to go on regardless of what happensm  during a lifetime. The read was enjoyable because the story was believable and told from the perspective of a young adult. It was interesting to see the lives of the characters unfolding and frustrating because of the way  it ended for the killer.

This started out with interesting characters who ended up leaving the book too soon. The middle got a little Jerry Springerish and unbelievable but it was worth it to finish the book ( I have a personal policy about finishing a book I start). There were times when I wanted to put it down and I did. I started this with much anticipation and was surpirsed at the simplicity of the prose for such a well liked author.

The author shares his life of poverty and emotional struggle for all the world to read about and provides a most heart warming memoir that is sure to make any reader more appreciative for all they  have. This is a life like many others who struggle and maybe make some poor choices in life. It is also another testament to how important men are in the lives of children, especially boys.
