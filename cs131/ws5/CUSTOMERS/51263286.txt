He starts off by looking at how Latin America has been looked at how the area has been looked at by scholars in the past. He then starts Latin American History with the conquest by the Spanish and Portuguese. Continuing with that theme, Chasteen looks at colonail rule and indendence. Chasteen then focues on how Latin America begins to develop on its own. He describes how liberalism and conservatism came into play in Latin American politics. Further, he deals with Latin America's relationship with the United States and Europe to describe the movements of ideas and migrations of people from Europe to Latin America. The book also deals with Neocolonialism which as America's attempts to influence Latin America. To end Chasteen deals with how Latin America begins to develop on its own during the twentieth century.

What I really liked about the book was that it offered more then just information about educational problems but also offered solution such as changing the teacher's unions and with schools like Amistad and KIPP which have done great jobs of educating disadvantaged children. The Thernstrom's also put an emphasis on culture between blacks, Hispanics and Asian families to try to explain their academic differences though it is really too generalized of an approach to look at racial differences since there is a large varaition within a single racial group (there are high performing Hispanic groups like Cubans and low performing Asian groups like Laotions and Cambodians). The Thernstroms also do a good job of attacking conventional ideas on improving education such as spending more mone, racial isolation and teacher quality and how these areas have not lived up to their promises.	2004-01-01

The politics of immigration have changed. There is more of a multicultural approach to immigration now and it's questionable whether or not we want to go down this road or not. There was a time when people were encouraged to abandon their pasts but now people are encouraged to keep their pasts. Either extreme is not the best scenario but Hanson does provide support against the mulicultural approach which is something we don't hear too much of. <br />Also Hanson deals with evidence about how immigration may be harming our country. Often we hear about the praises of immigration. Immigration does have its benefits like brining in skilled labor but also can lead to crime and can place a strain on public resources.<br />My problems with Mexifornia was that it was fairly short at 150 pages and that it seemed to be more of a personal narrative of Hanson's life in Selma instead. I wish he could have gone more in dept in his views and talk more of a national view then  mearly talking about the generational differneces between Mexicans in one small town in California.	2003-12-04

Most of the book deals with McCarthyism and fighting communishm from the end of WWII to the end of the the Vietnam War. She provides some useful evidence such as the Venona Project which provided links between the Soviet Union and spies in the America as well as giving explanations of MyCarthy to demonstrate that he had reasons to believe what he did and that he may have been mistreated by the left and textbook writers. It also deals with how party politics influenced the Cold War such as the end of the Vietnam war. <br />Coulter also provides some information on the conservative side of the current war on terrorism by dealing with allegations of misconduct by Attorney General Ashcroft and the Justice Department as well as issues such as racial profiling. <br />The only problem is that Coulter tries to make wisecracks and sarcasim that seem to take away from any sort of meaningful points that she might have.	2003-12-01

Thomas Sowell does an excellend job of bringing toghether a history of such programs. <br />In the first part of the book, Sowell deals with results of preferential policies. He looks at such issues as majority preferences in majority economies (such as the treatment of minority groups in America and Nazi Germany), majority preferences in minority economies (such as north Nigerians in Nigeria, Sinhalese in Sri Lanka and Maharashtrians in the Indian state of Maharashtra),  and minority preferences in majority  economies such as preferential policies towards 'untouchables' in India and minorities in America. <br />The second portion of Sowell's book deals with the illusins of ppreferential policies such as pitfalls in the agruments and why such programs have not been sucessful as they had planned on being such as creating violence/increating tensin between groups and the ability of such programs to be successful.	2003-11-30

The problem is that he checks with countries like China, India and Jamaica. Provided these countries really don't permit immigration but at the same time most Chinese, Indians and Jamaicans are not third generation but rather immigrants or first generation. Provided that these countries are growing rapidly there is still reasons why people are immigrating out to various other countries not just America. Indians are immigrating to Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Europe, and the Gulf states. Jamaicans are moving to Canada and the United Kingdom. They may have high growth rates but are still pretty far behind then most of eastern Europe and may have far worse governments as with the case of China which would prohibit any possible immigration. Also Brimelow seems like he is in need of a good factchecker in some parts of the book. In one part of the book, he is talking about immigration from Mexico to the United States and says that the children of Mexican citizens born are Mexican citizens. He actually puts that in italics to somehow convey that people should be shocked by this. However, Brimelow is an immigrant for the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has the exact same policy as Mexico. The children of citizens of the UK can receive UK citizenship even after they reach the age of 18. I participated in a study abroad program in London England earlier this year. One of the students in the program was born in America. Both of his parents were from the UK. While this student was in London, he was able to receive a UK passport, sign of citizenship though he had never aquired anysort of UK citizenship before then. He was 20 at the time. The United States does the same thing, just look at the Vietnam war. The children of American service personal were permitted to come to America because they are citizens. I've come across Americans whose parents are immigrants who have been able to receive dual citizenship. It is nothing that unusual. Brimelow also mentions some agruments in support of immigration in a way that seems he will disprove them but doesn't in an effective such as in the introduction when he talking about standard agruements such as immigrants are reveitalizing are city centers. He dances around the issue by talking increases in crime but fails also to take into account such factors as immigrants opening up businesses in these areas.<br />Overall, Alien Nation provides some decent information but it's safe to be a little skeptical of everything Brimelow has to say.	2003-11-10

If we know that languages follow certain orders, then we know they follow others as well. He examines different groups of languages such as polysnthetic languages and different basic word order types such as subject-verb-object and verb-subject-object languages, those than can make verbs out of adjectives and so forth.	2003-08-19

In the first chapter Sowell looks at how manyn doomsday projections have been made by the left like Malthus's idea on populatio have not held up over time. With the second chapter Sowell looks at how many social policies have failed such as the war on poverty and sex education. He looks at how crises have been defined, how solutions have arise, the results of the suolution and the later response that critize the way in which the problem was handeled. In the third chapter, Sowell looks at how statistics may create problems that may not actually exist. THe fourth chapter, irrelevance of evidence, Sowell looks at how evidence may not hold up certain arguements like Paul Enrlich's book the Population bomb and Ralph Nader's book unsafe at any speed. In the following chapter, Sowell look at how elite groups may define the struggles of other groups for them. In the next chapter, Sowell looks at the crusades of the annointed such as trying to disprove connections between AIDS and high risk groups. In chapter seven, Sowelll looks at the vocabulary of the anointed  such as access, stigma, progressive, diversity and crises and how such definations may not be beneficial because it creates probelems without debating them and looks over other things like personal responsibility. In chpater eight, Sowell looks at law and justice to examine how law is becoming more subject to popular opinion.

It's a collection of schlosser's magazine articles as opposed to a book so the three essays don't exactly work together to produce a singular work. However each essay does provide a pretty good understanding of each issue. The underground economy is a pretty big sector of our economy that needs to be looked.  Most people participate in it to some extent since it includes certain mundane things like babysitting and lardwork for cash that goes unreported.<br />The first essay deals with marijuana and the effect it is had. Over time, marijuana has been increasinly cultivated domestically often in places like the midwest and kentucky so a very middle american thing really. It furthere goes into how there is a great variety of punishment depending on where you are and how sometimes the punishment can seem severe. The second essay deals with migrant farm workers, mainly those who work on the strawberry fields in California. It looks at things like the effect of agriculture, minimum wages, union and ill-legal immigration affect our society. The last essay deals with the pornograph industry looking at how it has increased over time and government attempt to limit it. <br />Pretty good overall though schlosser could have written a book on each one of the three topics.	2003-07-27

Showdown was equally as good. In Showdown, Elder focuses on how big government may not be helping people. He deals with issues such as one of the biggest problems in this country in the breakdown of the traditional family and an increasing number of single mothers. This is problamatic because children need both parents present. This creates problems such as increased crime rates and poor school performance. The government has only increased these problems through welfare programs that make the government involved in raising children like a parent would. Elder also focuses on how the media can skew information by either ignorning information or favoring parties/candidates. Elder also fouses on contemporary race relations such as Jesse Jackson, reperations and the extent to racism in America. Also Elder focuses on how government programs relating to race such as affirmative action may not be helping black students. Elder also provides information about third party candidates and how they can challenge the two party status quo. Third party candidates have the potential to shake things up like Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura. Several Libertarians have been a signifanct factor in the loss of some Republican Congressional elections. <br />Overall a great read.	2003-07-22

Often the process is easier that it may seem. There is corruption and incompetence with the INS. Too often people are rushed through immigration check points because the tourist industry does not want people to be put through a hassle as well as the INS's reluctance to comptuerize a list of names of people who shouldn't be allowed into this country. In many cases with immigrants, the appropriate background checks are not performed making it easy for criminals to come into this country. When they do commit crime,s their native countries obviously don't want them back so they end up staying in this country. Further more, the government fails to do a decent job in tracking immigrans and international students. The government is unaware of where immigrants are and what international students are studying even if it is something like nuclear engineering. <br />This book should be a wake-up call for us all.	2003-05-23

The have had conflict for since the early days of Islam. Lewis takes a look at conflicts such as the crusades, the three Muslim invasions of Europe-Moors in the Iberian Peninsula, Ottamans in Eastern Europe and the Tartars in Russia. He also looks at how the Muslim world in North Africa and the Middle East was one time more advanced then the Europe and how the two have reveresed positions. <br />What Lewis spends a lot of time on is the perceptions of Islam had of the West and the perceptions that the West had on Islam. He looks at each side tried to discredit the other and how each perceivced themselves. Lewis also deals with the rise of political Islam in the 20th century after the end of WWI after the break up of the Ottaman empire.<br />Overall, a pretty good comprision and hsitory like Lewis's other works.	2003-05-22

She really seemed like an independent thinker who followed her own principles going with causes she believes in. Though openly gay and pro-choice, she voted for Reagan (definetely not typical) and was later president of the LA Chapter of NOW. <br />I liked her discussion on Dr. Laura a great deal. After reading the entire transcripts of when Dr. Laura referred to gays and lesbians and 'biological errors', her positions became clearer and were not intended to be biogated in any way. <br />THe chapter Misery Merchants also is beneficial because it provides insights of the Civil Rights establishment by focusing in on the actions of Jesse Jackson who has used the Civil Rights movement for his own gain. The chapter further goes into the campaign against Ward Connerly, a black man who spearheaded Proposition 209 designed to eliminate racial preferances in California's public universities and colleges. <br />Further there is the chapter Thought Police in Academia about how colleges are moving away from places of open discussion to places where the left dominates. Bruce mentions Penn State a few times in this chapter(I go there now) so I can especially relate to what she has to say in this chapter. A growing number of colleges and universities in this country are not becoming the places of discussion tha they used to be. Many colleges have 'designated' free speech areas and limited areas for giving out flyers. Conservative speakers are forced to cut their talks short because of unrully audience members. Also she mentions thelack of diversity in college newspapers. There was a major backlash against papers that ran David Horowitz's \\"Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery is a Bad Idea and Racist too\\" with students at the University of Wisconsin, Madison burning copies of the newspaper containg Horowitz's reaons and explanations for \\"Ten Reasons\\" (sound familiar). <br />Bruce also deals with how to deal with effective ways to bring about changes such as having a constructive dialogue and helping to market determine what gets heared. While head of the LA chapter of NOW, the book American Psycho was published. THe book featured the main character killing women in several brutal ways. In stead of trying to burn copies of American Psycho, NOW iniated a boycott of the publisher and instead of preventing bookstores from carrying the book, Bruce was able to get Bookstores to place the in areas where children would be unlikely to buy it and in areas where the book would not be subject to impulse buying. She also deals with the O.J. Simpson Trial and how she feld that Judge Ito was giving Prosecutor Marsha Clark a hard in comparasion to the male lawyers on the case. Instead of labeling him as a sexist, she  met with Judge Ito and discussed the issue with him with videotape to back up her point. He did begin to change his dealing with Clark in a rather clear manner that even people were not trying to pick up on the changes were able to do so. <br />Pretty good book about where our society is going and how that may not be a good thing.	2003-05-17

He starts off by dealing with the Tokugawa and ends with the current political situation at the turn of the century. The appendixes provide a good account of Japanese government by listing the prime ministers and the country's election results since the end of WWII. Contemporary History of Japan focuses on important aspects of the Tokugawa regime such as its political, social and economic set up of Tokugaw Japan and focuses on its eventual downfall. The book continues with the Samurai revolution and the Meiji revolution that set the path for Japan to become a world power. Gordon then continues Japan in the early 20th centiru and how the countr began to change internallly as a result and how Japan dealt the Depressoin Crises in the 1930s, its wars with China and Russia and its eventual role in WWII and the American influence in the post WWII years. After the end of WWII, Japan becomes a dominant figure on the world stage with rapid economic growth unparalled else where in the world resulting in massive changes in society. Gordon does deal with Japanese economic troubles in the post WWII era such as the oil crises in the 1970s and the how Japanese bubble burst as well as other issues Japan is facing such as low-birth rates and changing gender roles. <br />Great background to Japan overall.	2003-04-26

He looks at how ethnic minorities have been able to suceed without civil rights legislation and how civil rights legislation and other legislation designed to help minorities such as minimum wage laws have not been as helpful as the designers have planned. Also Sowell looks at how civil rights legislation has expanded beyond provided equal opportunity to such programs as affirmative action and busing which have had questionable success. He also looks at such factors as the quality of education received and cultural attributs of ethnic groups across borders to help explain differances such as how ethnic Germans have higher rates of professional jobs then Hispanics not only in the United States but Hispanic countries as well and overseas Chinese have dominated science and engineering in several countries. <br />Probably the best part of the book is Sowell's conclusion where he  tries to debuke his critis and those that misterpret his views such as those saying that eliminating differences in IQ and education between ethnic groups would automatically eliminate economic differances but factors such as quality of education and choice of careers play important roles as well.	2003-03-10

Nomi Klein takes a look at these different factors in No Logo in which she tries to make sense of all these differenat changes. <br />Klein takes a stab at the growing levels of advertising and corporate sponsherip in society such as corporate ties with schools such as having pepsi and subway deals with schools as well as the extent to which corporations such as Nike and Marlboro create images of successful athletes and wide open cowboy country to sell its products to people such as inner-city youth and workers in third-world cities. <br />Klein also takes a look at how corporations are limiting our choices in terms of product. There has been a proliferation of franchising and expansion of companies such as Wal-Mart, McDonalds, Subway and so forth over the past years that our country is looking like one huge strip mall without much character. Mergers such as AOL and Time Warner futher consaladate the media so we have fewer voices being heard. Because of growth of corporations, they can affectively silent views such as Wal-Mart refusing to carry certain albums and book stores refusing to carry certain books. <br />Furhter more, she begins to deal with jobs. Increasintly corporations are moving to the third world to open up factories while closing factories in the united states thus sucking away what was decent paying jobs and creating poverty wage jobs in the third world. When in retail or food services, corporations are eliminating full time jobs in favor of part time jobs such reducing people's ability to have a decent paying job. <br />Finally Klein ends wiht how people are begining to challenge corporate dominance such as through through boycotts and grass roots activism.

Overall, it looks at over all human behaviours and history helping to explain humanity at the present. Diamond does an excellent job describing human evolution out of Africa into other parts of the world and the different species of primates that played a role in this process. He goes further into describing how human behaviours such as sexuality, how humans pick partners and manage sexual relations. He also looks at things that make humans distincly human such as language and art. He compares these accomplishments to animals and questions the benefits of some such as agriculture and condemns others such as drug/alcohal use. He further goes into detail about the conquest of certain peoples by other people and how humans cultures have hurt their own progres making species extinct and making certain great civilization decline over time. <br />Overall, this is a good complement to Guns Germs and Stee.	2003-02-11

If you have an older version of Pepole History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the Twentieth Century might be good because of the chapters relating to the elder Bush and Clinton administrations.

The authors deal with such important issues of how immigrants arrive in this country. There are some families that come toghether while others may be split up. One spouse may come before the rest of the family or sometimes children are sent to live with family members before their parents come over. The question of identity is important. What culture do the children of immigrants feel closer to? What determines this? There are several factors such as parents, schools, peer groups and the larger society. Education is anouther big topic. Immigrants tend to put a high emphasis on education though immigrant children have varied education achievements. They can often be the best at school or towards the bottom. The authors look at how people such as parents, principals and teachers all affect education for immigrant children. <br />Over all, a pretty good account of immigrant children.	2003-01-24

I've mainly read Sowell's books from the 1990s like his race trilogy and Inside America's Education System.  Race and economics was published in 1975 so itgoes back to his early career. He provides a history about the correlation between, race, ethnicity and economics have played themselves out in America. He first deals with slavery and American blacks to see how slavery affected the American economic system and compares that Latin American and Caribbean slavery. He also looks at how slavery affected American blacks differently from Latin American/Cariibean blacks. Sowell also deals with immigrant ethnic groups like Japanese, Jews, Irish, Italians and Puerto Ricans and look at their development in America and compares them to look at their different developments and cultual beleifs. TO end, Sowell also deals with race and the market and race in governmetn. He looks at how things such as rent controls and minimum wage laws have affected minority groups.

There has been a influence from the Middle East through means of money, missionaria, copies of the Koran and the construction of mosques. Foreign oil and gas interests like Chevron have come in the region trying to gain a foot hold into the area's untapped oil and gas resources.

Some of the stuff is actually interesting such as chapter 2 entitled 'Pre-Colombia America' about how things like warfar and environmental damage being caused by American Indians before European colonialization and chapter 33 called 'losing China' about how America did a pretty good attempt to prevent China from becoming the world's largest communist state. However, there are other chapters that are too obscure that take away from more of the serious chapters.

How did Africa reach this condition since it is where civilization began? Peter Scwab tries to to figure out what's wrong with Africa. He first visited Africa as a peace core volunteer in the early 1960s and has returned to the continent after that. He goes through time looking at the problems the contient has had. He starts by looking at the slave trade and how it perpetuated war among the various different ethnic groups so they could aquire slaves to sell to slave traders. Often, guns were brought in as payment only further increasing the warfare. Then colonialism came to basically economcially exploit the continent and creating an infrastructure that was better suited for the mother country then the colony. As a result of colonial lines, waring ethnic and religious groups were put toghether. Intentional or not, these divisions still cause problems to the present day. The Cold War came in bringing new military aid further increasing warfare. Compound Africa's problems with numourous civil wars, brutal dictators and constant warfare amoung nations only makes the continent worse off. AIDS is a crises in sub-Sahara Africa will large numbers of people becoming infected with no signs of it stopping which places a large number of people at risk for early deaths. Compound this with the countries inability to pay for AIDS medications the legal barriers they have had to obtain these drugs through generic prescripation manufactorors. The growing level of globilization is leaving Africa behind more so than other parts of the third world. Africa faces problems with instable government and transportation problems. Other problems that Schwab deals with are famine, disease, problems with rainfall. <br />Provides a good account of African problems past and present.	2002-10-19

There is a growing sense of how these people identify themselves in America. Different factors such as caste, ethnicity and religion come into play. The 'desi'- those of South Asian ancestory or immigrated at a young age are trying to identify themslves in the larger society. They are trying to find out what's like to be an Indian so far away. One of the more public displays of this is that of parades such as the India day parade or performance such as during deepavali festivals which are the focus of Mukhi's research. She's a desi being born in the Phillipeans and then immigrating in to the U.S. These public displays provide an opportunity to be in a large group to celebrate people's ethnicity, they can wear traditional indian clothing and eat Indian food. Indian movies also come into play because of India's role as the world's larges film producing nation and its imports to the Indian diaspoira. These movies provide an opporunity for desis to see movies made by those of their heritage.	2002-10-13

This part of the country has long experienced different waves of immigration. South Asians are a new group to the area mainly starting in the late 1960s and is continuing today. Maira looks at how second generation south asian americans or 'desis' cope with identities as being in between black and white and dealing with stereotypes of the asian intellectual and asian store owner. Maira also focuses on obstacles they overcome while growing up such as racism (dotbusters in New Jersey, racial insults...) and with cultural differences with parents (especially for females). In addition, there is also a focus on the different ethnic/relgious differences that exist within the South Asian community that come into play. Of course with other immigrant groups, there is a a strong desire for the second and third generation to 'reconnect' with their heritages which is an important part of the book. She deals with how in the interviews desis have a desire to go to South Asia to discover their heritiage. One issue she deals with is south asian immigration patterns to the U.S. Often we think of South Asians as coming directly from the subcontinent to the U.S. directly after the immigration act of 1965. However, it's deeper then that. The first South Asians migrating started in the late 1800s and early 1900s. South Asian also come fromo other part of the South Asian Diasporia such as east Africa, United Kingdom and the West Indies. These South Asians add to the complexity of studying the group. <br />Overall, an easy to read book about 'desis' in the northeast.	2002-10-04

However, Brock doesn't seem of showing that he had a whole lot of belief of his work as a conservative. He admits that he fully didn't believe what he wrote about Anita Hill and wrote what he did out of pressure from his publishers. At the same time, it doesn't seem as though his opinions on the issue change much. He stands as almost a libertarian that really didn't fit into the whole Reagan-Era religious right of the 1980s which he was apart of, something that was only compounded by his being homosexual. He mainly changes sides because of the problems he saw with the right. <br />Brock does do a good job of showing some problems such as their witch-hunt mentality when the attack Democrats like the Clintons and those who speack out against conservatives such as Anita Hill.	2002-08-22

Timmerman provides an account of his work with such likable people as Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat. Also he covers how Jackson boycotted companies for not hiring blacks then arranging things so the jobs would be given to gant members and people out on bond. Through the book, it becomes evident that Jackson has used his position as a leader to line his own pocket while leaving behind the people he claims to work for.	2002-08-18

Goldberg is a perfect source to find out about this on account of his 28 years working for CBS. Goldberg deals with important issues such as how the news media can focus in on certain issues depending on who is president such as the case with homelessness and how the media can misrepresent issues such as AIDS. There are important issues that are not covered that he discusses in the chapter the most important story you never say on TV about the efects of the breakdown of the family. The media reports on it such as the rise teenage sex, rise of sexual abuse and falling academic acheivement but fails to connect the dots as Goldberg puts to find the root of these problems. In addition, Golberg does something that Ann Coulter does in her book, Slander, about how the media demonizes the right while not doing so to the left. <br />Overall, Bias does paint a better picture of what the media is all about.	2002-08-17

He gives accounts of brave men who risked it all to create national chains. Scholosser looks at the underbelly of this now international system. The fast food industry has had marked influences on the way we live. He deals with the growth of franchising which fast food nation perfected and how it had developed marketing campaigns directed at children to fuel its sales. In addition, the fast food industry has had marked changes in our agricultural system which have helped to push family owned farms out of sight with the creation of large corporate farms that employ largely illegal immigrats at poverty wages. Schlosser also deals wtih meat production, large corporate farms have created environmental damage such as erosion while meat packing plants have become breading grounds for disease and harshly treats its workers by paying putting them of high risk of injury and death while paying them little. In terms of the labor market, Schlosser deals with how the fast food industry has lobbied to keep teenage wages below the minimum wage to save on its young workforce.

Though I find some things odd such her avoiding places multicultrual setting such as Chicago, New Jersey, California or New York and choosing Minnesota and Maine as two of her locations. Such comparisions between those two environments would have been greately appreciates especially taking into account that the multicultural places tend to have higher costs of living further hurting the working poor. Though Ehrenreich does give voice to a segment of the American population that is overlooked. One of my favorite part of the book is when she is in Maine working as a maid. She is watching TV realizing that the life of the working poor is not mentioned causing them ot believe that their numbers are smaller than they actually are. Enrenreich gives voice to the working poor by shoing the level of difficulty involved with living on ... an hour. She is often forced to work two jobs or consider it in order to make ends meet. In addition, she deals with the hard work that's involved in a lot of menial jobs. She mentions the strain of jobs such as maid work and waitressing have on people.	2002-08-14

Bernard Lewis covers this part of the slave trade well in Race and Slavery in the Middle East. He goes through time from pre-Islamic times to the 20th century. He discuses how slavery in that part of the world becomes more and more of racial concept that enslaves both whites, black and people from the caucasus montains and each group was perceived. Lewis also focuses on how other ethnic groups in the Middle East such as Persians were looked at. In addition, Lewis goes through how the growth of Europe slowed down slavery and eventually lead to its abolition in North Africa and the Middle East from initially cutting off supply from the Cacasuss Montains and Eastern Europe and then from Sub-Sahara Africa.	2002-08-08

Double Victory continues in that tradition. Takaki focuses on different ethnic groups and how they reacted to American involvement in WWII. It deals with the desire of minorities to be treated as equals with them seeing WWII as a chance to prove their loyality to America through war. Takaki deals with African-Americans, Native Americans, Chicanos, Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. Takaki deals with what these groups hoped to deal with their invovlement in WWII. Takaki also deals with the the treatment of Japanese Americans from being labeled as enemies and being interned. Takaki focuses on racial discrimination in the war effort from military factories to military service showing how their racial barriers were overocome.

In her book, she does bring out some interesting topics such as the common use of of such terms of 'right-wing' republican or 'religious conservative' while terms such as 'left-wing' democrat or 'pro-union libeal'. However, a lot of her basis for saying this is her searching terms into a lexis-nexis search. Just because the media fails to use certain terms as much as others doesn't mean that they don't exist on realilty. Though, the I agree the media use of such term does in a way demonize them. Of course there are plenty or left-wing democrats and pro-union democats, just as many as right-wing republicans or religious conservatives. Such labels to conservatives have not really hurt their cause, electing popular presidents like Ronald Reagan, and both Bushes or appointing supreme court justices like Rehnquist and Thomas or cabinet members like Ashcroft. In addition, one can see the popularity of such conservatives as Rush Limbaugh, O'Riley and even Ann Coulter herself. Yet I find it interesting that Coulter takes such a hard line stance against moderates in the Republican such as Todd-Whitman  and some Senators she describes as the 'New York Times favorite Republicans' (page 177) including Shelby, Specter, Snowe, Collins and Chafee. It's interesting to hear her describe them in such a way, because she seems to say that liberals act in that matter. <br />Coulter does make some good points such as how the media fails to attack the Democrats from taking money and depending on unions and special interests similar to the Republicans taking money and depending on groups such as the moral majority, the NRA and big business. Also, she deals with how the media is critical of people who used to work for republicans while not giving the same to people who used to work for democrats. Also there are points about liberals are quick to label the right as stupid, idiotic, racist... without really going into much detail about why. Coulter also provides a good defense of Fox News and other right-leaning news sources such as the Wall Street Journal as a means of getting the conservative cause out. This helps to balance things out against more left-wing news sources. In terms of demographics, she does bring out how the so cold religous right is more likely to vote democrat then such special interests to the Democrats such as African-Americans and single-moms.	2002-08-01

He deals with how the U.S. had supported the Taliban around 1996 and 1997 because of their opposition to Iran and because of oil interests (specifically Unocal) wanting to build a piple from central Asia going through Afghanistan but eventually disbanded after critisms from women's groups and after the Taliban's connections to terrorism have become apparent. Rashid provides great accounts of of how the Taliban first emerged in Afghanistan in 1994 to its present focusing on how the organization emerged and how it was able to rise to power. <br />Rashid also deals with the role of Islam and the Taliban. He focused in how the Taliban has eroded the rights of women taking them out of the public sphere completely including prohibitng female education and employment. This move of course has grave consequences for men as well because of the large number of female educators and medical professionals. The opium fields were also mentioned. The Taliban helped to protect the opium fields despite Islam's prohibitioni against intoxicants. Such a plan was really only supported by the idea that opium was going to non-Muslims abroad so therefore it was OK for Muslims to grow opium. The issue of Arab-Afghans including Osama bin Ladin was mentioned. Afghanistan became a battleground for Islam during the Soviet invasion of the 1980s. The invasion brought Arab Muslims to the country helping to shape Afghanistan. <br />Rashid also deals with how the rest of the world dealt with the Taliban. It dealt with how the U.S. initially had supported the Taliban to some extent because they were able to bring some level of stability to counter-act neighboring Iran and could possibly protect an American built oil-pipeline going through the country but how this alliance quickly brokedown after news of the Taliban began reaching America including its treatment of women and support of terrorist acts against America. Other players in Afghanistan were also mentioned including Iran which backed the shia opposition. Other countries that were involved in Afghanistan during the Taliban included Pakistan, Russia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.	2002-08-01

He also attacks the left's dealing with sexual behavior and HIV/AIDS and how liberal policies have seemed to increase the level of STD.

I though I would read race and culture after I read Thomas Sowell's Ethinic America which is another great book. Race and culture is good because it really deals a lot with how things like geographic conditions influence culture and econmic development. There are also things such a good history of slavery, broader then the history taught in our schools. The book goes into great depth about how immigrants have changed and been changed by moving to different parts of the world. The book also deals with how certain professions and cultural qualities stick with a group through time and how different ethnic/religous minorities have been treated through time. It really helps with understanding race on more of a global scale.	2002-01-30

The book does not really deal with black society as a whole. However, McWhorter is still brave for writing this book because it does dare to question African-American academic acheivement. Losing the race is a good source to help understand race in this country but needs to be combined with other sources like america in black and white and end of racism.	2002-01-27

Though the book deals with British colonial control over India, the book relates the colonialism across the globe really.

Lies also deals with how ineffecitely how history is being taught to our children. It seems more and more of our students are graduating high school withoug knowing anything about major historial events of american history. However, Loewan does go into his personal views of society which undermines the book because the book starts off well by showing our history and then turnds into loewan's crusade, but the book is still something good to read.	2002-01-26

It deals with problems surrouding race in the past and how race relations have improved vastly in the last half century. Race relations have improved through things like the civil rights movements and through people's attitudes changing to be more accepting of people of different races. The book also deals with contemporary race problems relating to things like affirmative action, racial quotas and a chapter called the &quot;racial climate&quot; dealing with subjects like the O.J simpson trial, voting rights and inter-racial marriages/dating. The book ends with chapter &quot;one nation, indivisible&quot; shows helps to show how much people's attidutes have changed through time and that America's attitudes towards minority groups is actually far better then European country's attidutudes to minority groups.	2002-01-14

They have been excluded from mainstream histroy in the past and some like women and african-americans have been receiving more attention over the years, groups like socialists, native americans and pasifists have not and Zinn does include these groups in his book to help give more of a complete history. HE also deals with how the federal government of america has traditionally taken a pro-business stance regardless of who is in charge and how that has shaped our country for better or worse. The book deals with more recent events like the nixon, carter and reagan administrations and how they have continued to take a pro-business and pro-rich stance and how people are growing more politically apathetic. <br />Though extremely liberal, overall people;s history of the united states should help to give people a more complete understanding of american history.	2002-01-14

It really opened my eyes to see how people come up with identifying themselves in race in adolscents and this occuring mainly in minority students. This can lead to minority students associating with members of their own race which acts as a way of trying to figure outwho they are as people. In addition, this book is good because it takes the discussion out of the terms white and black by taking into considertations, Latinos, Native Americans and Asians. <br />The only real flaw is that Tatum focuses a little too on her own life and lack enough large studies that would better back her opionion up and giver her more credibility.	2002-01-14

The book talks about what policies countries should try to be emphasing through trade policies and the effects of unions and government protections on the economy. It moves a way from a lot of the theoritical evidence like comparative advantage and focuses on actual data which can be some what different then what economic theory says.	2002-01-13

Education has done a lot to help girls out, who are now doing better then boys and are more likely to go to college. The book deals with how the process happened and what can be done to help boys do better in school like single sex education (which the book says is good for both genders). It goes into detail about problems of girls in education has been addressed really well and given a lot of attention, but so far not enough attention has been given to boys.	2002-01-12

Prosperity and violence does this so brillitanly that i read the book in a matter of a few hours. The book talks about how trade has brought people toghether to create cities to trade creating goverments in order to control and facilitate the process. Through time, goverment and the economy became mutually dependent and modern countires became to develop which the books compares to newly independent countries in the 20th century. The books goes into the present dealing with the cold war and how former allies of America and the USSR are comping with the transition into the 21rst century.	2002-01-07

Rothenberg has been to assemble a lot of great articles but they all seem to be written by people left of center so you don't hear much diversity in terms of point of view. How much can you really learn about race, class and gender without hearing about people both from the left and the right? It seems that the left has been getting far more attention then the right. The book is filled with examples of how racism, classism and sexism still exist but none with how much society has overcome these problems and that these problems are not as big in society as you would think from reading this book.	2002-01-07

The fact of the matter is that black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean earn more then whites and their children do better in school then whites. Racists do not differentiate between black Americans and Caribbean and African blacks. In addition, Asians do better economically and educationally then blacks even if they immigrant to this country knowing little or no English! Racisist notions such as banks not giving credits to blacks is not held up when asians are taken into consideration because asians get approved more then whites and no one is saying the banking system is biased in the favor Asians.  Jared Taylor does a really good job tackling the ideas of affirmative action and double standards and how they are interfearing with the idea of being color-blind (which was the point of the civil rights movements) by saying that we need to judge people differently on the basis of race and that people cannot be judged against people of other races but only of people of their own race.	2002-01-06

It seems a large number of colleges in the country do not require things like Western literature or Western History even though we are a Western Nation and that Western ideas have influenced things like democrarcy and egalitarianism though I admit it took generations for their ideas to be implemented. <br />A lot of things D'souza talks about are still going on today like a great deal of racial groups clustered toghether with full university support through like minority frats, social groups, dorms...Part of what college is about is about learning about people who are different from you and the best way to do that is through interacting with them. <br />Probably the best thing in Ill-Liberal education is the last few pages of the book where he talks about his three modes proposals such as non-racial affirmative action taking into account economic background, family situation and educational back ground, equality and the classics emphasizing classics that deal with equality and human differance (incorporate non-western books when necessary) and choice without separatism for university groups.	2002-01-06

This book is interesting because it deals with a lot of contemporary issues in our society relating to gender issues such as sexual harassment and rape and how better to address gender problems in our society like clearer definitions in law of sexual harassment and consent. If a few women are joking around about a picutre in a playgirl magazine, is it sexual harassment towards men? The courts have said yes. It also deals with how people still don's really want as much as gender equality as they say including women. It seems that over the past generation or so there has been a big push to make fathers involved in their children and doing more things aroudn the house which is a good thing of course but now there are many women who now feel unfcomtorble with this now because they feel that they should have more power in those areas after trying to get men more involved. Often there is conflict between groups on issues but this book seems to emphasize that both men and women need to come toghether and work toghether to find solutions to our problems and that we need to be gender neutral in all aspects of our lives. The last chapter in the book &quot;where do we go from here&quot; is really good because it deal a lot with how to improve things in the future like not blaming all of women's problems on sexism and you should try to reverse gender roles wehn making judgments relating to gener.	2002-01-04

Finally I found out about this book and it gives a really great accoount of the Jewish-Indian groups-Bene Jews of West India, Cochin Jews of Kerala and the Middle Eastern Jews in cities like Delhi and Calcutta. It gives detailed account on how the arrived in India and how lived there with their neighbors and colonial rulers. The book also deals with how Zionism and Indian independence were both exteremely importatn to Indian Jews and how they were torn between these two philosphies because of their emergence to the mainstream at the same time.	2002-01-04

Though not as well written and researched as People's History of the United States, Raphael does do a good job of telling about how different groups saw and participated in the American Revolution. There is plenty of important information such as the large numbers of people in pacifist religious groups like the Quakers and German protestant groups like the mennanites and shakers who were against all war because all the fighting they had seen in Europe through the centuries. It also deals with groups like Native Americans, African Americans and women. These groups were not treated as whole members of society before or after the revolution (not to say that their condition would have improved under continued English rule) so it was interesting to see their involvement and opposition to their war. In addition, the book deals with fronteir groups that suppored American independence, not just northern merchants or southern plantation owners that we are more familiar with.	2002-01-04

This is continued bu discussing their lives after they start to live here. It seems that Sowell covers a lot of the big groupsl like Africans, Germans, Italians, Japanese, Puero Ricans, Mexicans and Jews. Such a book is important because it helps us to understand our shared background as Americans. There are similirities why our ancestors came here as well as prejudice and discrimination faced by all at one time or another. It gives hope for the future because through history that groups become more accepted in society as time passes and groups become part of the melting part.	2002-01-04

To often when people look at colonialism they focus on things like the green areas belong to France, the red areas to England and they brown ones to Spain. Things Fall Apart deals with colonialism differently. They tend to emphasis trade and look at the whold process in economic terms. There was a great deal of loss in terms of life, community and culture. This book will help give people a better understanding of the human side to colonialism in terms of what those being conquered went through.	2001-09-05

I also disagree with his idea that free blacks owning slaves was a major problem. Obviously, it was still wrong but free blacks owned about 10,000 accourding to D'souza minor in comparission to slavery as a whole especially a good portion of those slaves were not used for labor but but were family and friends that free blacks bought so they would no longer be in slavery. However, D'souza does bring interesting points that racism may not be the biggest problem facing minorities today and that there are cultural and other problems like poverty, crime, education and one parent households that are larger problems. With that, racism definetely has decreased in American society and minorities do have a great deal of oppurtunities for themselves. In addition, cultural relativism may not hold that much wait considering because most people who believe in cultural relativism could be converted through D'souza logic. THe chapter entitiled Bigotry in Black and White: Can African Americans be racist? does a good job into question black anti-semetism and racism and showing that racism is still racism even if people lack the power to enforce their hatred.	2001-08-30

It continues with Loewan's reputation of trying to end some of the lies in American history and to add things that needed to be added. In certain ways he is bringing up things similar to Lies My Teacher Told Me like the Spanish influence in America and focuses on questioning some things like President's Buchanan's sexual orientation. There are also things that make you ask why such as the memorial to confederate soldiers in Montana of all places.	2001-08-30
