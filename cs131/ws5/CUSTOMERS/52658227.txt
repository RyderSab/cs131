The facts are that energy is limitless. the universe IS energy. It is all around us and regulatory attempts to conserve it are misplaced and will do more harm than good to the energy supplies. [by distorting the market forces that generate, distribute and utilize that energy efficiently]<br /><br />Huber utilizes well-accepted principles of economics to prove his many points. These include the fact that energy is abundant, virtually everywhere, and with technologies already in use, is accessible to man's use and that the more energy is used, the more can be found and utilized for any and all of the growing range of purposes to which energy applies.<br /><br />On top of that, attempt to conserve usually lead to increased energy use and Huber presents much data to support this.<br /><br />This book falls in along with the exciting Russian discoveries about the real source of petroleum and the overwhelming mass of evidence that we will never ever run out of oil. People who claim that we have peaked in our oil production usually say \\"discoveries have peaked\\". Well yeah, you know why? Because known reserves are now greater than they have ever been in our history. The known reserves are so vast it is a waste of time and money to explore for more and will be for at least 50 years.<br /><br />The most fascinating point in the book is the new discovery that North America - long criticized for our \\"consumption\\" of energy and concurrent emission of CO2 - now known to be the largest lane based CO2 SINK in the world. North America not only absorbs and recycles ALL of its CO2 emissions but absorbs huge qualities from the rest of the world!<br /><br />  see [...]<br /><br />[to put things into perspective - the world exchanges an annual mass of 150 Billion metric tons of CO2 per year. Human activity accounts for 8 Billion or 5% of that total.]<br /><br />The USA is also the most efficient user of energy when manufacturing and economic activity are factored into the total energy picture. A fact that Huber claims will put the USA is a very good position as energy demand puts upward pressure on prices. The more the fraction of costs that are attributed to energy rises, the bigger advantage the US has. IN fact another 20% rise in prices could entirely wipe out the cost advantage China has in the manufacturing sector.<br /><br />Examining policy, the book analyzes the real effects of energy policies that have been enacted. The effects of these policies are when viewed in total always make matters worse and are all counterproductive to either conservation of energy, reduction of pollution, or both. As Ludwig von Mises's discovered; all economic regulation is ultimately and inevitably harmful to the very goals it was emplaced for in the first case.<br /><br />Overall, the authors shine the harsh light of truth on the record of government interference in energy markets. The track record is not encouraging for future regulation.world exchanges an annual mass of 150 Billion metric tons of CO2 per year.

Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution Is Wrong	Books	5	48	78	N	Y	A different kind of book on evolution	I always like to amuse myself with the \\"single-star\\" reviewers who \\"review\\" a book without the undue burden of actually having read it. Wells does not write this as an advocate of creationism. He restricts the scope of this book to examining scientific evidence and concludes that Darwinism fails to hold up to the evidentiary standards of science. Any \\"reviewer\\" that has actually read the book would know that.<br /><br />This is different kind of book on evolution in that it is one of the few that actually adheres to real scientific principles. Nowhere is any scripture quoted, the Bible mentioned or is there any discussion on competing theories. This is a book that examines the science of evolutionary theory as it stands today.<br /><br />What does that mean exactly? Simple - many of the poor unfortunate victims of government education think that \\"science\\" just means anything coming out of a laboratory or more practically anything that criticizes religion.<br /><br />Okay folks listen carefully to what \\"science\\" really is. Thanks to Wikipedia for the definition:<br /><br />***<br />\\"Scientific methods or processes are considered fundamental to the scientific investigation and acquisition of new knowledge based upon physical evidence. [Darn that physical evidence]<br /><br />Scientists use observations, hypotheses and deductions to propose explanations for natural phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions from these theories are tested by experiment. Any theory which is cogent enough to make predictions can then be tested reproducibly in this way.<br /><br />A scientific method is essentially an extremely cautious means of building a supportable, evidence-based understanding of our natural world.\\" [Evidence again? come on now we have work to do]<br />**<br /><br />A few things stand out here. First - prediction to test a theory, evidence, \\"tested reproducibly\\" and so on.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read on evolution that actually uses \\"science\\" to examine the evidence for or against the theory. (I've read many on both sides of the fence) Science being evidence based.<br /><br />Wells certainly has the scientific credentials to do this and certainly more qualified than most of us to examine this evidence and make assertions based such evidence or lack thereof.<br /><br />The central theme of the book examines the main \\"Icons of Evolution\\" that the defenders of the theory call upon to show that evolution has been proven or at least demonstrated by the preponderance of the evidence. When someone asserts that evolution is a \\"fact\\" or has been \\"proven\\" they typically use one or more or all of these \\"Icons\\".<br /><br />They are briefly<br />1. The Miller-Urey Experiment<br />2. Darwin's Tree of Life<br />3. Homology<br />4. Haekel's Embryos<br />5. Archaeopteryx<br />6. The Peppered Moths<br />7. Darwin's Finches<br />8. Four winged Fruit Flys<br />9. Fossil horses and their evolution<br />10. Ape to Man (the famous ascendancy drawing)<br /><br />Wells scrutinizes these icons and pretty much explodes them all. The real fact here is that none of these icons support Darwin's theory - even the ones that aren't faked ( like the peppered moths or Haekel's Embryos).<br /><br />One example I can sum up refers to the origins of life and the Miller-Urey experiment; if we don't know what conditions existed, or what conditions are necessary, and can't reproduce the event in the laboratory, and can't show it to be statistically probable-why are we so very sure that it happened? Such evidence would not hold up in court, and sure won't satisfy the requirements for a science.<br /><br />Granted Wells is not the first to point out the problems with all these so-called proofs, but put together like this and no open minded person can look at the theory of evolution again without wondering why, if the evidence is so strong do the orthodox followers of the theory rely on these shaky (at best) themes?<br /><br />If evolution is fact, thenshow it with scientific rigor. Wells shows us that the evidence is in question, or is outright false or faked. If these icons represent the best proof of evolution and I suppose they must since they are presented in \\"science\\" textbooks over and over again, then it appears as if Darwinian Evolution is truly a myth. Wells presents this case in a very readable book.<br /><br />I gave a copy of this book to a high school science teacher I know. She refused to even open the cover. This is not the reaction of one dedicated to science.<br /><br />Darwinists generally refuse to debate the subject preferring instead to resort to name-calling and personal smears. This always makes me suspicious. If you have defendable evidence show it, debate it and quiet the critics.<br /><br />It has always mystified me why educated people dedicated to \\"science\\" (see above definition) prefer instead to ignore contrary evidence and home in on their own personal pet theory or myth. That's not science. That's dogma.<br /><br />Again with thanks to Wikipedia:<br /><br />\\"The term dogmatism carries the implication that people are upholding their beliefs in an unthinking and conformist fashion. Dogmata are thought to be anathema to science and scientific analysis...\\"<br /><br />Many real scientists maintain that the evidence for Darwinian macroevolution does not meet the standards for science. Asking evolutionists for evidence usually arouses annoyance and sometimes, if persisted in, hostility. Getting around the real evidence thing is difficult, but of course almost anything can be made believable by considering only favorable evidence and interpreting really, really hard.<br /><br />This book clearly shows that Darwinian evolution has not been proven, and has so far failed every attempt to be proven using a real scientific method.<br /><br />In response to the preceding \\"reviews\\" evolutionists are obsessed by Christianity and Creationism, with which they imagine themselves to be in mortal combat. This is peculiar to them. Real sciences, such as astronomy and geology, even archaeology, are equally threatened by the notion that the world was created in 4004 BC. Astronomers pay not the slightest attention to creationist ideas. Nobody does, except evolutionists. This shows that we are really dealing with competing religions; overarching explanations of origin and destiny in conflict with each other. This is the root of the fury of their response to skepticism.<br /><br />The term \\"Creationist\\" is to evolution what \\"racist\\" is to politics: A way of preventing discussion of what you do not want to discuss. Evolution is the political correctness of science.<br /><br />Try getting a straight answer from a Darwinist; it's like giving a bobcat a prostate exam. You'll get everything but answers. They'll tell you you're a crank, imply over and over that you're a Creationist, they'll say that you're an enemy of science as if someone who asks for actual evidence is an enemy of science.<br /><br />This is the behavior not of scientists, but of advocates, of True Believers. I used to think that science was about asking questions, not about defending things you didn't really know. Religion, I thought, was the other way around. I guess I was wrong.<br /><br />Wells however addresses none of these issues. This is a science book written by a credentialed scientist. Philosophy and religion are outside the scope of this work despite Wells' critics feeble claims to the contrary.<br /><br />I've read the so-called debunking of Wells. I encourage all of you to read it as well. It will tell you way more than I can about the state of evolutionary \\"science\\" and the quality of the evidence. Some researchers take issue with how Well's presents their own research. It's not the first time in the history of science that certain discoveries are ignored or suppressed when they conflict with the existing momentum.<br /><br />One `reviewer\\" claims that \\"deconstruction is easy\\". He is right.Deconstruction of DAWINISM is easy. Deconstruction of science is anything but. Deconstruction of science, real science is virtually impossible. Do we see anyone deconstructing the laws of motion, relativity, celestial mechanics or other real sciences? Nope. The evidentiary rules of science require proof that is irrefutable. That's what \\"science\\" means.<br /><br />Wells has also been criticized for only mentioning negative evidence and \\"ignoring\\" all the supporting evidence. Perhaps but this is perfectly legitimate in the world of real sciences. Again this is by people who are ignorant of real science. You can have the best hypothesis in the world supported by a mountain of evidence yet the hypothesis fails to take into consideration other negative evidence and fails to make an accurate prediction. In science this means your hypothesis is a flawed or false. You are not allowed to ignore evidence against your hypothesis or cook the evidence to your specifications. Yet this is exactly what Darwinists do routinely. Wells is merely doing his job as a scientist in pointing this out.<br /><br />Wells wrote a science book here. It's sad that many claiming to be advocates of science fail to recognize that. That alone speaks volumes.<br /><br />The subtitle of this work is \\"Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution is Wrong\\" and Wells does an admirable job of showing just that.<br /><br />I don't expect this to change the minds of the entrenched orthodoxy however. I am reminded of the following wisdom: [from a real scientist]<br /><br />A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. - Max Planckst attention to creationist ideas.

Ironically this book stimulates your imagination of what American will be like with the Fair Tax - I thought about it, I dreamt about it and woke up in a cold sweat. I am no longer convinced this is a good idea.<br /><br />I have been a Fair Tax supporter since the firt time I ever heard the term on Neals radio show. I have had several letters to my local newspaper published supporting the plan, I have donated money to the group and talked it up to everyone I know.<br /><br />I would love to see the IRS fall into a black hole. I would adore using the 1040 form as toilet paper and even more love to spend my IRA without Congress getting their hands in my pocket. The federal income is immoral and yes folks - it is illegal. It needs to be repealed today if not sooner. It was a swindle from the first day. It promised that the average wage earner would pay nothing only the \\"rich\\" would pay and then only a minute percentage of their income would be taxable. Oddly it was the richest people in America at the time that lobbied the hardest for passage! Well maybe not so oddly - they were all exempted. Hahaha fooled ya.<br /><br />After however reading this and one other book on the subject I am no longer convinced it is a good idea.  This book is an excellent discussion on the plan and discussed most of the main strong points of the plan. It is weak in addressing the shortcomings however. The lack of these discussions made me a little more skeptical than I had been of the plan.<br /><br />Hey, again I would love to see the IRS go away. I would love even more to be able to spend all of my IRA tax-free. Yipppeee. Ain't gonna happen. One reason I think it will never happen is that media has been silent on the plan. The great propaganda machine has not been softening up the public to get ready for it. It's easy to tell whats coming by what gets mentioned in the news. There will be a war with Iran very soon and next year for sure access to vitamins will be prescription only. Watch the reports and see what they are preaparing us for. The Fair Tax is not on the list.<br /><br />The scariest think about the Fair Tax is that if passed it is almost a dead certainty that we will end up with BOTH the income tax AND the national sales tax. Why do I think that despite much coverage of this in the book? Easy - Congress will first of not give up the money machine called the income tax. Taxation is about money but also about power. The federal government will not willingly give up that power to tax income and have access to every financial transaction by every person.<br /><br />Look at the totals money collected by the income tax. It almost exactly equals the interest on the national debt. So your taxes pay for nothing at all , no planes, tanks, seniors prescriptions, FBI, FAA, NOTHING but profit for the privately owned federal reserve. Yes folks, if you pass this through you will be guaranteed to have BOTH. Iron clad. No doubt. It's not even debatable. There are no credible counter aruguments. You will get both taxes and the Fed owners will get richer and we as usual will get poorer.  I challenge any other 5* reviewer to dispute this with facts.<br /><br />The Fair Tax legislation may \\"call for\\" repeal of the 16th amendment but there a long way before it can actually be repealed. Congress cannot by themselves amend the constitution  (thank God). The Fair Tax legislation as currently written will call for the elimination of the income tax, but that has not been voted on nor has it been in committee! Anything can happen in committee.<br /><br />Expect \\"compromises\\" The first likely will be a \\"transition period\\". Linder claims he will pull his support of this happens. Well maybe he will but by then it will too late. Congress will be drooling of the prospect of having BOTH Taxes the momentum will be unstoppable. By the time it gets to the floor the bill be be 2-3 times the number of pages. We all knowthis, even you Fair Tax supporter know this.<br /><br />Congress will never ever eliminate a tax that generates a known cash flow for one that does not. They will cry all about \\"fiscal responsibility\\" - they will whine about the rich getting a better deal so they will need at least a \\"supplemental\\" income tax on the \\"rich\\". Anyone with half an inkling about how DC (District of Criminals) works can see where that will end up.<br /><br />One glaring omission in this book is that they have not forseen the liklihood of congress futzing with the tax rates, thereby eliminating any possibly compliance costs savings. Can you say \\"social engineering\\"?<br /><br />Every special interest group from the Sierra Club to N.O.W. to the NRA and Handgun Control Inc. will be clammering for special rates for and against certain items. NRA will want an expemption for guns, HCI will want a 10,000% tax rate on them. N.O.W. will want exemptions for birth control pills while others will want them heavily taxed. On and on and on. It wil be impossible to pass this bill without bribes to key voters. Just look at the CAFTA vote only this will be worse. By the time they get all the bribes paid off there will be 200 tax rates on day one then 2000 within 5 years. Can you say \\"compliance costs squared\\"? 133 pages of tax legislation - ha in your dreams. Congress can't decide what to have for lunch in 133 pages. Multiple that by 10 and you have a reasonable STARTING point.<br /><br />Can we really trust the pols to repeal the 16th amendment anyway? Most of the states with income tax use the federal income to justify their income tax. They don't want to see it go away. Here comes the big compromise - we'll keep the income tax but only on the \\"rich\\" again. How does the old saying go - fool me once shame on you - fool me twice shame on me.\\" This is why after reading this book I can no longer support the tax despite how well this book is written and how sincere the writers and supporters are. They left way too many holes and actually undermined their own arguments not meaning to.<br /><br />Linder and Boortz try to deflect criticism by saying the legislation is written to avoid the pitfalls and dangers. They actually did a fine job here and it is well covered in the book. However they fail to point out that any provision can be changed even after passage. The income tax laws started out small and simple - smaller and simpler than this law.<br /><br />Should we dump the income tax but we also should make sure that we replace it with nothing. Linder and Boortz defend the viability of the tax by stating that is is \\"revenue neutral\\".<br /><br />Well that my friends is the BIGGEST DRAWBACK of the Fair Tax! We don't need revenue neutrality! We need to reduce the amount of money the government takes out of the economy. Whether they steal it by means of an income tax or a sales tax, they are still stealing money from the economy and mainly blowing it all with nothing to show for it. It doesn't matter HOW they get it - it is that they get it in the first place that hurts the country.<br /><br />I just wish Linder and Boortz would just put their considerable intellectual power and media exposure into convincing people that we need neither the income tax or the  national sales tax.

Finally an element of fairness in the tax, reduction of compliance costs to make the USA competitive again. Everyone hates the income tax. The Fair Tax will save America - right?<br /><br />If it sounds too good to be true to probably is - words to live by.<br /><br />The Fair Tax will be a disaster and this book does nothing to make me feel any different. I used to support the idea of the Fair Tax until I actually thought about the implications. I can see the gaping holes in this plan and realize the potential for a national sales tax would be even worse than the income tax.<br /><br />First of all the IRS would not go away - it may change it's name ( probably won't even do that)  but it's not going anywhere. If we extend the same level of growth to the fair tax as the actually happened to the income tax the Neo-IRS will be in your house every year demanding receipts on everything you purchased to prove you paid the tax and didn;t buy off the non-taxed black market at the claimed 30% discount or more.<br /><br />Instead of 30% ( the real rate, not 23% ) or so there could not limit to the amount of tax due on a sale even amounts greater than 100% - something the income tax could never do. Nothing in the Fair Tax proposal safeguards against it and even if it did it can be easily changed. ANyone who claims the tax rates would not gorw exponentially just doesn't understand how the District of Criminals works<br /><br />I can easily imagine the Federal government in their typical fashion attempting to perform the same social engineering using the sales tax as they do with the income tax. Bad things would be discouraged with a higher tax. Items used by the \\"rich\\" will warrant a higher tax since they can afford it. I am confident that within 5 years there will be 2500 ( or more) different sales tax levels. This will eliminate any possible savings of income tax compliance costs and may even end up being more costly than administering the income tax.<br /><br />Think you would like  about a 10,0000% tax on guns and ammo. That can be done with the stroke of a few pens, effectively wiping out all of your 2nd amendment rights without actually making owning guns illegal. You don't have to make guns illegal if they cost more than your house. Only Rosie O'Donnell's bodyguards could afford to arm themselves; us little people would be priced out of the market.<br /><br />It is perfect, it's a no-lose scenario for the feds. Recall the so-called luxury tax that taxed high-end boats and cars resulting in rampant unemployment in several industries and drove boat buyers offshore where they paid NO taxes. The \\"Fair Tax\\" will cause this at every level of industry. The feds have wanted to restrict private aviation for years, now's their chance with a 1000% tax on AvGas or a 3000% tax and aircraft parts. (of course to fight terrorism). Think it can't happen? You darn sure know it can and likely will.<br /><br />Looking at the history of the income tax is a view to the future of the so-called Fair Tax. Originally the income tax probably sounded great. It had low rates and then only on the highest income brackets. It would save the country. We would all love it. It would be no burden at all.<br /><br />The \\"Fair Tax\\" does nothing to limit government growth and spending and will probably make matters worse. Taxes would be more easily raised with campaigns like \\"A penny for freedom\\" or higher tax rates on \\"luxury goods\\" or other politically incorrect items like home schooling supplies.<br /><br />The black market will flourish not that that is necessarily a bad thing in my opinion, but that would drive rates up on legitimate purchases even more. Soon you will only be able to survive on black market goods with their artificially forced higher thanks to the national sales tax.<br /><br />Anyone who really studied the issues such as Harry Browne, Rep Ron Paul, Llewellyn Rockwell and others have clearly demonstrated that we can easily eliminate the federal income and replace it with nothing, and SHOULD do so immediately. We would gain the all the advantages they mention and many many more without actually having the sales tax burden. Promoting the Fair Tax is waste of time. He should put the same effort into educating the country about the illegality and lack of need for the income tax - then we might get somewhere.<br /><br />Today the foundations of the income tax are starting to weaken. The IRS is losing important court cases regarding challenges to legality of income tax - not that you will know it if you read the standard media - but this is the area in which we need to be concentrating our efforts. The IRS can no longer force compliance to an administrative subpoena, they can no longer demand documents absent a court order. Joe Bannister was acquitted - the man who published books saying the tax cannot be enforced. The IRS LOST this case!<br /><br />We have an opportunity to finally put stake through the heart of the tax vampire.

The IRS is losing important court cases regarding challenges to legality of income tax - not that you will know it if you read the standard media - but this is the area in which we need to be concentrating our efforts. The IRS can no longer force compliance to an administrative subpoena, they can no longer demand documents absent a court order. Joe Bannister was acquitted - the man who published books saying the tax cannot be enforced. The IRS LOST this case! <br /> <br />We have an opportunity to finally put stake through the heart of the tax vampire.

US	52658227	R2VCHA2TAUU8QF	1563526859	199819751	The Terrible Truth About Liberals	Books	4	8	12	N	N	I like Boortz	Usually I like Boortz not all the time. This book is Boortz at his best. Biting wit and satire is sprinkled \\"liberally\\" throughout the book. This book contains may truths all of course filtered through Neals *sometimes* libertarian viewpoint.<br /><br />Neal claims to be a libertarian but many of his views fly in the face of real libertarian ideals. Neal is fan of the War on Terror but he should know better. A real libertarian would know that the War on Terror will have no more success than the War on Drugs or War on Poverty. Federal \\"Wars\\" usually end up creating an environment more conducive to the thing you are warring on. The three \\"Wars\\" I mentioned are cases in point. Neals knows this or should.<br /><br />That being said he takes some pretty good pot shots at the liberals of today and most of what he observes is accurate. I wish he would turn more of the biting wit on the neo-conservatives, but since Neal is a Neo-com himself I won't wait for that.<br /><br />The real puzzlement to me Boortz's support for the so-called \\"Fair Tax\\" A real libertarian would see the holes in this plan and realize the potential for a national sales tax would  be even worse than the income tax. The IRS would in no form go away - it may change it's name but it's not going anywhere. If we extend the same level of growth to the fair tax as the actually happened to the income tax the Neo-IRS will be in your house every year demanding reciepts on everything you purchased to prove you paid the tax.<br /><br /> Instead of 30% or so there could not limit to the amount of tax due on a sale even amounts greater than 100% - something the income tax could never do. Nothing in the Fair Tax proposal safeguards against it and even if it did it can be easily changed.<br /><br />I can easily imagine the Federal government in their typical fashion attempting to peform social engineering using the sales tax as they do with the income tax. Think about a 10,0000% tax on guns and ammo. Can be done with the stroke of a few pens, effectively wiping out all of your 2nd amendment rights without actually making owning guns illegal. Perfect, it is a no-lose scenario for the feds.<br /><br />In 5 years there will be 2500 ( or more) different sales tax levels thus negating any possible advantage of elimating compliance costs. The black market will flourish not that that is necessarily a bad thing in my opinion, but that would drive rates up even more. Soon you will only be able to survive on black market goods with their artifically higher thanks to the sales tax.<br /><br />The \\"Fair Tax\\" does nothing to limit government growth and spending and will probably make matters worse. Taxes would be more easily raised with campaigns like \\"A penny for freedom\\" or higher tax rates on \\"luxury goods\\" make those rich SOB's pay their \\"fair share\\". Recall the so-called luxury tax that taxed high end boats and cars resulted in rampant unemployment in several industries and drive boat buyers offshore where they paid NO taxes. The \\"Fair Tax\\" will cause this at every level of industry. The fes have been wanting to restrich private aviation for years, nows the chance with a 1000% tax on AvGas or a 3000% and aircraft parts. ( of course to fight terrorism )<br /><br />A real libertarian would know all this. A real Libertarian would know that we can easily eliminate the federal income and replace it with nothing, and SHOULD do so immediately. We would gain the all the advantages they mention without having the sales tax burden. Promoting the Fair Tax is waste of time. He should put the same effort into educating the country about the illegality and lack of need for the income tax - then we might get somewhere.<br /><br />Neal exbibits the same myopia on many issues that he accuses the \\"liberals\\" of - they are guilty but then so is Neal.<br /><br />All in all this is an enjoyable book, but his criticisms should have been more evenly distributed across the line and been a lot more fun if he poked the same holes in the so-called conservative<br />causes as he did the liberal ones.nes.	2005-07-21

Some may recall that Mr Shortt was one of the sponsors of a push to  get Christians to pull their children en-masse from the public schools.  Although the resoltuin never passed Shortt was added to the long list of enemies of the DOE and NEA.<br /><br />Shortt fires his broadside with a number of weapons, some from the Christian perspective, but most should be of issue to nay parent concerned about the childrens future.<br /><br />While you can go about whether schools should exclude religion from the curriculum or not - this argument has proponets on both the Christian and secular sides, Shortt's most powerful criticisms have nothing to do with religion.<br /><br />In my view the points made by the author are very strong indeed and boil down to basically the schools are \\"dumbing down\\" the curriculum, children are bored silly and many have to be drugged ( Ritalin, etc ) in order to put up with the hours of stupifying boredom in the dumbed down classes.<br /><br />Shortt makes a good case. He argues also that reform efforts are futile since the system is structed in a way that will resist any attempts to reform any thing other than cosmetic features.<br /><br />There are many fine works on the history of public education, and we don't need to go into them extensively here, but Shortt points out that the current system was modeled after the old Prussian system, Prussian schools considered children to be the property of the state. The state treated them that way. They were taught to be obedient to the state and their main purpose is to advance the interests of the state.<br /><br />For this goal, real education was unnecessary and even counter to the overall intention of public schools. The author makes a strong case that the US public schools are designed exactly in this format.<br /><br />It certainly explains the current level of literacy in the country. Some states even keep statistics on the illiteracy rate of high school graduates!<br /><br />This was only the case here in the country AFTER the adoption and evolution of the public schools to it's current form. Many argue that public schools are a failure. Shortt seesm to present the argument that they are accomplishing exactly what they are designed to do: mold the children into willing consumers of the products of big business and obedient servants of government.<br /><br />The aims of state schools were to transform thinking, highly individualistic and very literate citizens into an unthinking, collectivized mass. The slow but steady decline in literacy of all kinds was a by-product. I have to agree, that is what they are designed to do are succeeding.<br /><br />Shortt points out that , \\"The truth is harsh, but simple. Those who control government schools want your children and they want your money. They don't want you sticking your nose into what they consider their business ... \\" (p. 323).<br /><br />Shortt's recommendation: vote with your feet. Shortt has an plethora of reasons why Christians ought to homeschool their children or place them in private Christians schools. His arguments ought to be listened to by non-Christians. The dysfunction that has fallen over government-sponsored education, after all, affects Christian and non-Christian children alike.<br /><br />The truth be known, homeschooled children excel over their public educated couterparts by a wide margin. Most hoemschooled chilren at at least 4 grade levels above their public educated friends.<br /><br />As Philosopher Stevn Yates points out:<br /><br />\\"The \\"harsh truth about public schools\\" is that they are an enemy not just of Christianity but of academics, personal and intellectual independence, and even children's safety.<br /><br />They cannot educate, which is unsurprising since over the past couple of decades their focus has been on inculcating political correctness and teaching job skills ... Their aim has not been education but the production of desirable forms of mass behavior. The government-sponsored educational system is thus the major contributor to the dumbing down of the country.\\"<br /><br />All parents and not merely Christians owe it to their children to read this book.has not been education but the production of desirable forms of mass behavior.

If you haven't read Relic but plan to, hold off and read Relic first. Relic in my opinion is one of the most suspenseful exciting mystery stories I have ever read.<br /><br />Reliquary picks up where Relic left off. It also does it one better. It will spoil Relic however of you have not read it, but it is not necessary to read Relic first to get full impact from this book.<br /><br />This is a certified \\"can't out down\\" book and you can just go ahead and dedicate the weekend to it. Once you start reading it will impossible to put down for any length of time.<br /><br />The gangs all here with Margo Green, Vinnie DAgosta, Frock, Smithback and of course the indefatiguable Pendergast.<br /><br />This is an essential in the Pendergast series and serves as a great introduciton to one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters in contemporary fiction.<br /><br />The Reliquary is gripping from the first page. NYPD divers discover 2 skeletons while diving for a disgarded heroine package. The remains are fairly fresh but missing the heads and exhibit teeth marks in assorted spots; was it wild dogs, rats or something else? The plot goes into overdrive from there and climaxes in the deep mysterious underground world of New York City's abandoned subway tunnels.<br /><br />It is part, \\"Night Stalker\\" part \\"X-Files\\" and all scary.<br /><br />This is best of genre type novel and raises the bar for semi-supernatural suspense murder mysteries. A movie would an amazing event indeed provided they could find someone to play Pendergast properly.<br /><br />I discovered Preston and Child with \\"Cabinet of Curiosities\\" and have been on a crusade to read everything they have ever written. This book is wonderful and I can't imagine any one being disappointed with it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-02-01

What was I expecting? I'm not sure what I expected but let me tell you all that this is the mother off all expose books.<br /><br />Evans lets no one off the hook and the tales told here are so eye-opening that I really dare not recount them here since no would believe it. Evans however spent 10 years reseaching this book and it shows.<br /><br />This is athrilling read and there is a shocker on practically every page. The biggest shocker to me though was Evans' assertion that Onassis was the man behind the killing of Robert Kennedy. The idea at first sounds ridiculous but read the book and let Evans make his case. His facts check out. It sounds like a real life Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />This is nasty book full of dirt personal secrets and shocking accounts of infidelity, drug smuggling, corruption and is totally entertaining. You may not want anyone to see you with it but I was fascinated. The side benefit of it all is that it probably all true.	2005-01-20
US	52658227	R2QXQO75GMOFUS	0399150803	642490368	Trojan Odyssey (Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	so-so	I guess Cussler had a renaissance of sorts here. In some ways this was the best Pitt novel in a long while. Clive has some of the old spark back. Plus I suppose Dirk had a dose of gold kryptonite taking away his superpowers of recent novels.<br /><br />I did like it and I agree with another reviewer that this is likely to be the last Dirk Pitt novel. Not the last of the NUMA crew for sure but then again, we'll likely have Dirk Junior to knock around for the nest decade or so.<br /><br />Like the last half dozen Pitt stores, Cussler revives his tried and true - if somewhat tedious - formula. Dirk and Al the heroes against another billionaire meglomaniac bent on:<br /><br />SELECT \\"evil_plot\\" FROM PITT_PLOTS where (SELECT plot_type, evil_villan, FROM PLOTS where (plot_id = (SELECT (rnd(plot_id))<br /><br />You get the idea. My thought is Cussler has a computer write his books from a database of mad scientists and evil plots. This one is better, but still the same old repetitive story, now the evil guy is Specter ( SPECTRE?) maybe KAOS and THRUSH are next.<br /><br />I guess I liked it overall. It moved fast enough but still so predictable I probably could have written it myself all I need do is fill in the name of the bad guy and historical background facts.<br /><br />It is worth reading I think for long term Pitt fans wanting all of Dirks loose ends tied up. I won't give away any more than that, probably don't have to anyway. Everyone already knows what it's all about - the same as the last 6 Pitt novels.<br /><br />Unfortunately tt's no \\"Raise the Titanic\\" but fortunately it's no \\"Oregon\\" either. So read and enjoy and then go re-read \\"Titanic' or Vixen 03 and have great memories of Dirk and Al.	2005-01-19

I received it as a gift 3-4 years ago and it sat on my bookshelf for about a year.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a book about Leonardo DaVinci, but after a day of reading I found that it is really a book about yourself. Loeonardo was of course a genius for all time and this book attempts to explain how DaVinci became DaVince ands how we can train our minds in the same way.<br /><br />By utilizing a series of practical exercises you can change the way you perceive the world around you.  You need to recognize and put into practice the seven principles for success.<br /><br />* Curiosita: An insatiably curious approach to life.<br /><br />* Dimonstratzione: A commitment to test knowledge through experience.<br /><br />* Sensazione: The continual refinement of the senses, especially sight, as the means to clarify experience.<br /><br />* Sfumato: A willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty.<br /><br />* Arte/Scienza: The development of the balance between science and art, logic and imagination (\\"whole-brain thinking\\").<br /><br />* Corporalita: The cultivation of ambidexterity, fitness, and poise.<br /><br />* Connessione: A recognition and appreciation for the connectedness of all things and phenomena; \\"systems thinking.\\"<br /><br />I think principles dovetail nicely with any field of study or human endeavor. I use these principles in the martial arts and the study of Qi Gong. I also practice them in my professional life as an engineer.<br /><br />This book can give you a whole new perspective on life if you are willing to take the time to explore, feel, taste, listen and observe.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-03
US	52658227	RM6WEU35N1BVH	0895260476	989380415	The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History	Books	5	61	80	N	N	Myth busting	This book is a revelation from the very first page.<br /><br />It is unfortuinate the conventional history in this country is more reminiscent of the Soviet's history texts which followed the one rule: \\"Never make the state look bad.\\"<br /><br />I'm a history buff and there are two ways to study history in my opinion. One is the \\"who, what, when, where\\" approach that was so popular when I was in grade school and made me think that I hated history. The other is the interpretive approach that is so popular in public schools and universities today; that is the Soviet style history that endeavors not to just avoid making the state look bad, but to malign everything but the state and attribute all bad things in history to outside forces and all good things to the state.<br /><br />Professor Woods has penned a brilliant book on American history that will call into question virtually everthing you learned in modern public schools or at least put that information into a new perspective for you.<br /><br />Have you learned that the \\"Civil War\\" was trimumph for freedom and liberty and the Lincoln was our greatest president and saved the Union? Do you believe that the US rode to Europes rescue during WW1, were you taught that FDR saved the country from the Great Depression and saved the world by allying with Stalin to rescue us from vicious murdering fascism? Do you think that Eugene McCarthy was the real \\"un American\\" and chasing communists under the bed in an act or unfounded paranoia?<br /><br />I have always thought that something was \\"not quite right\\" with American history as taught in schools but never really got interested enough in the subject to really care.<br /><br />Thats why I am so thankful for books such as this one. First of all it is a facinating read. I read each chapter more than once I think beciase the first reading is so unlike anything you've learned before you need time to get your mind around it. Then an amazing thing happens. You are whispering to yourself - \\"That makes sense. I finally understand!\\"<br /><br />This folks, is what history has been missing all those years.<br /><br />The author's sources are impeccible and you'll be nodding your head on each point.<br /><br />Finally history makes sense.<br /><br />When you finish the book you'll understand why this book is maligned so much by folks who have never read it. This book is truly threatening to that old Soviet rule of history - a rule so firmly embraced by conventional \\"historians\\".<br /><br />This book is a revelation and will ignite an interest in the history of our country and perhaps be a foundation block in reversing all the public school brainwashing and yes - lies.<br /><br />I love the history of our nation despite all the politically correct nonsense about the white men stealing the land from the Indians. The settlers bought the land from the Indians in acts of mutually benefical exchange. When I was in grade school they mentioned that Manhattan island was purchased for a box of cheap beads and jewelry. Nowadays that is no longer mentioned and if it is they use it an example of how we screwed the Indians by getting the island for a box of cheap junk. This is example of the biased nonsense that passes for scholarship today in conventional circles.<br /><br />In reality the settlers got along great with the Indians for along time until the state got involved ( How do you think Thansgiving got started?) . If you want a tragic story, read what US Grant and St. Abraham of Lincoln did to the western plains people. You won't hear about that in the state schools.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the scholarship on the US Constitution. This will book will help the reader understand what the document is, where it came from and what it means as well as its relevance today. Today it is more important and relevant than ever yet largely ignored and misunderstood. This point alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />I have read numerous negative reviews of this work both here in Ammazon and other places and none have so far questioned the factual basis of this book nor offered any examples of inaccuracies. When they resort to shrill name-calling you know you have them.<br /><br />Read and enjoy rediscover what the real United States of America is all about.I have read numerous negative reviews of this work both here in Ammazon and other places and none have so far questioned the factual basis of this book nor offered any examples of inaccuracies.

I always want to read \\"just one more chapter\\".<br /><br />First we have to welcome back John Corey formerly of the NYPD and now assigned to anti-terrorist task force with the FBI.<br /><br />Readers will remember Corey from Plum Island and Lions Game. No one does a wisecracking, iconoclastic hero like Nelson Demille and Corey is my favorite of his characters.<br /><br />Corey now takes on the FBI and the CIA in investigating the loss of TWS flight 800 off Long Island. Officially designated an accident by the NTSB and the FBI, there are enough contrasting eyewitness accounts as to what happned to make anyone wonder if they really found the truth or the whole thing was a big coverup.<br /><br />Demille takes the story from the actual events and posits the scenario: \\"What if someone took pictures or videos?\\" What would that do the official conclusions?<br /><br />The book is well plotted and Demille takes off like a race car with the story. Corey, true to form doesn't let up for a moment and cuts slack to no one.<br /><br />A story like this would not be nearly as interesting with a character less robust than Corey. Readers who have read an enjoyed Plum Island and Lions Game will welcome him back along with a few others including an unexpected one.<br /><br />I think that Demille covered the controversy about the TWA 800 incident fairly and wove it into a great story, It, like all Demilles books is fast paced and full of surprises. He has his facts checked and his backdrops are accurate to the last detail.<br /><br />You will wonder how much of this is real and how much is from the mind of the author. He blends the two things so well you'll accept what he says and that makes the story all the more fascinating - mainly from the truth and accuracies the author went to the trouble to include.<br /><br />I love Demille books and I would have to say he is my favorite author. His workd are enduring and often better in the seconds reading. He throws so much so fast and his wit is so sharp often you need two readings to absorb it all.<br /><br />I won't deal with the details of the novel here. Alomst anything I can say abot it could be classified as a spoiler. All I can say  is read the book. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with it including the knock-out ending.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.o sharp often you need two readings to absorb it all.

In my opinion his best was Andromeda Strain, none of the others in my opinion rose to the level of suspense or imagination.<br /><br />I don't regard Chricton as a first rate author like Nelson Demille or Frederick Forsyth. I think his books are just written on too low a reading level for me. I don't know what on level he chooses to write but it feels like maybe Junior High school level. I get bored at some points slogging through the prose and and unsophisticated metaphors, but that being said this is a very courageous novel for him.<br /><br />Global warming is a pardon the pun - hot subject today and I'm sure Crichton is not making many friends with this book. He pretty much explodes the whole myth during the course of the story.<br /><br />Maybe I enjoyed it because of the extensive reading and research I have personally done on the subject, but I did like it ands read late into the evening hours.<br /><br />The author does a good job of presenting the evidence on both sides of the controversy and as always its better to keep an open mind about the whole thing. Crichton's points about the state of science are well presented. If you think the science of global warming is settled, you are right.( maybe not in the way you think if you watch Dan Rather) It's the politics that are not settled and the author does a fine job of presenting the reality of the controversy. Global warming is not a scientific issue the science really is settled, it's a political issue and MC does a good job presenting the dangers of mixing politics into science. Science is no match for politics and that is the fastest way to compromise real science.<br /><br />This book is not likely to change every mind on the subject, but MC presents the arguments as the backdrop to a thriller so enjoy the thriller and the mystery. As a thriller it is not that all that great, but at least MC keeps does keep it interesting if not all that exciting or thrilling.<br /><br />A random check on the refernces show them to be accurate.br /> <br />A random check on the refernces show them to be accurate.	2004-12-31

According the author all bad in the world today is caused by radical religious zealots.<br /><br />Harris scores a few points here mainly against radical Islam, studiously ignoring the fact that most Muslims do condemn the radicals and claim that they do not represent mainstream Islam. I tend to believe them, if all Muslims were potential suicide bombers there would be a lot more violence in the world. I read that 8,000 or so people were killed by Islamic terrorista in the past decade. This is fewer than the 100,000 or so killed by US bombs in Iraq and 500,000 killed as result of sanciotns and the US bombing Iraq water supplies. power plants and waste treatment infrastructure.<br /><br />What frightens me about Harris's book is that he claims that some people can never be reasoned with and advocates pre-emptive action against a group of people for no other reason than because they ARE Muslims! That should frighten anyone even Harris's fans.<br /><br />Of course when you study history you may find that the so-called \\"enlightended\\" atheistic are the most prolific mass murderers and make the Islamic terrorists look like tame and quaint little wanna-be's. Lets see there was the Soviet Union - atheist state; Nazi Germany - atheist State; Red China - Atheist State; Khmer Rouge - Atheist State; North Korea - Atheist state. Need I continue? Well, one more - the suicide bombings were actually started and invented by the Communists in Malaysia - atheists all. They account for 120 MILLION or so dead.<br /><br />Harris seems to worry that we could face a disastrous terrorist attack with hundreds of thousands killed based on beliefs that he says belong on the same shelf as Batman. I submit that erroneous or radical political beliefs belong on the same shelf yet Harris has no problem with using those beliefs as a guideline for mass murder.<br /><br />For example. from the book: \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. . . . Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion,\\"  That sounds more like a rationalization from Josef Stalin or Chairman Mao.<br /><br />This is obviously not a good situation and a fair point, but what does it matter if people are killed for bogus reasons what exactly those reasons are, whether they are religious or poliitcal? Is it really any different that 100,000 Iraqis were killed for a bogus WMD theory or 3000 Americans are killed because God told them to? My point here is that while yes, the radical religious nuts are dangerous, the radical political nuts are even more so usually because the have the power of a state military to do their killing for them.<br /><br />The \\"enlightened\\" and secular political groups have a much worse record for killing innocents than all the religious nuts in the world. Harris ignores all of that in favor of his very narrow focus. This of course does not excuse the religious nuts but it is important to put them into perspective. They are not as grave a danger as the political atheists.<br /><br />No, the problem is not really religion. The problem is radical agendas of any sort including Harris's. When he advocates a pre-emptive nuclear strike against an entire country that has never overtly threatened us, well them I can easily see his sympathies with the countries I mentioned earlier.

Hitler may have been insane but he wasn't crazy.<br /><br />It had a lot of material about FDR's and Harry Hopkins communist sympathies and is consistent with historical fact as far as the strife and struggles preceeding the U.S's entry into WWII.<br /><br />I suppose few readers are that well versed on pre-WWII history to know this, but there were a lot of Nazi sympathizers in the US prior to the war. Many viewed Hitler and not Stalin as the \\"lesser of two evils\\", and felt the US should have allied with Germany against the USSR. This book recaps that history in the context of the story without taking any stand on the matter.<br /><br />Like most of Ludlums stories, he is good with detail and keeps the story moving well enough where you'll want to finish it in as few a sittings as possible.<br /><br />This is not high literature, it is not ground-breaking it's just good old fashioned action and adventure with enough plot twists to keep you going even though many of the outcomes are predictable. The predictability doesn't seriously detract from the enjoyment of the novel.<br /><br />I have to say that this is on par with Lundlums best works and worth a read.	2004-11-15
US	52658227	R3P0BG296DLMNU	044653143X	960521744	Brimstone (Pendergast, Book 5)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Splendid	I love the continuity of Preston and Child novels. Together thay have creted one of the most interesting characters in detective fiction I've ever seen: Special Agent Aloyious Pendergast.<br /><br />Fans will remember him from Relic, Reliqaury, The [magnificent] Cabinet of Curiosities, and the recent Still Life With Crows. I love the way they build upon his history and reveal elements of his personality as the story progresses.<br /><br />In any event, Perdergast teams up again with Vincent D'Agosta ( Preston and Child fans will remember him) former NYPD Lt, now former detective novelist and present uniformed Sergeant from Long Island to solve a grusome murder.<br /><br />Reviled but respected art critic Jeremny Grove is found murdered. Not just murdered but burned to death from the inside! The room stinks of sulphur and brimstone. A cloven hoofprint is found burned into the wooden floor. A melted crucifix is found in the smoking hole in his chest. Before his death Grove held a dinner party and called anumber of people who have no apparent connection to him.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds with the greatest challenge to Pendergast ever in his career. D'Agosta struggles to redeem himself from his failed writing career.<br /><br />This book is worth buying NOW. Don't wait for the paperback, or for it appear on the discount rack at Books a Million. I would have to say that this is Preston and Childs greatest effort to date. You'll regret waiting even a week for standard delivery from Amazon.<br /><br />A few reviewers have commented that this is like The DaVinci Code only better. Friends, this book makes The DaVinci Code look like a comic book in comparison. This is an example of fiction of this type should be but all too often is not.<br /><br />The authors will hook you into the story from the first page and you'll end up re-reading entire chapters as the story unfolds either to prolong the enjoyment of the story, or to re-amaze yourself at the skill the authors utilize in sprinkling hints, clues and teasers throughout the novel.<br /><br />The book is loaded with fascinating insider type information like Brown did with DaVinci but somehow the authors used such skill that it adds so much depth to the story without being the story. DaVinci is only interesting for it's revealing of this information. The story itself is pretty standard \\"boy/girl chased by bad guys\\" stuff.<br /><br />Nothing so pedestrian will ever emerge from Preston and Childs word processor.<br /><br />I can't emphasize enough how good this book really is. If you've never read a Pendergast story before there are enough teasers in here for you to want go out and get the entire collection, but not ever having heard of dear Aloyious before will not prevent you from totally enjoying this work.<br /><br />It will have you on the internet often checking the amazing facts spread out over the book.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.

US	52658227	RXRR54V669BC3	0060582510	541105320	Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism	Books	2	38	56	N	N	Perpetual war for perpetual peace	Let me say that I am NOT a democrat, either large or small \\"D\\". I don't call myself a liberal or a conservative except in the \\"liberty\\" root word usage of the term liberal, unfortunately now obsolete.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from a conservative Bush-loving friend as an antidote to having just read \\"Dude Wheres my Country\\". Trust me you need an antidote after that one. Likewise. DWMC is a great antidote to his book.<br /><br />Anyway, after much thought and evaluation (haha) I have concluded that Sean Hannity is easily the biggest warmonger, the most fanatic Republican apologist and gushing Bush idolater in the country today. I wouldn't be surprised to see him hired on by a second Bush adminstration or see them support him as a candidate for congress somewhere.<br /><br />In his mind Bush can do no wrong despite a few sprinklings of insincere \\"Bush is not perfect\\" comments here and there. I still can't figure out how anyone things George W. Bush is a conservative.<br /><br />Possibly this book may fall in under the McCain-Feibgold bill as it is a not much more than a Bush campaign ad. If Fahrenheit 9/11 ads will be restricted under McCain-Feibgold, then surely will Sean's book be as well.<br /><br />Hannity is certainly one of the most militant warmongers in the public spotlight. Not only was he overwhelmingly in favor of the war in Afghanistan is a supporter of the current war in Iraq, and he encourages an endless war against terrorism. He also ends the book with a virtual declaration of war against China, Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Perpetual; war for perpetual peace. I'm sure the irony escapes Sean and his neo-con fans<br /><br />There are evil regimes exist all over the world, always have and always will, that oppress, starve, rape, maim, torture, and kill their citizens. Does that mean the United States must become the world's policeman? Should we \\"Invade the world\\"? Sean believes it: \\"America has the moral right - no, obligation - to fight for its own security, and that of any oppressed nation\\" he points out.<br /><br />Of course Sean ignores the history the US has of supporting and supplying many of these evil regimes - Hussein included. When Saddam supposedly \\"gassed his own citizens\\" the US rose up to defend him at the time probably since Reagan and Bush I supplied him the gas!<br /><br />Hannity is a master apologist for the Republican Party. He continually rails against \\"left wing elites\\" , \\"liberals\\", \\"Democrats\\", the \\"Democratic Party\\", the \\"liberal elite\\", the \\"liberal establishment\\", the \\"left-wing establishment\\", the \\"left\\", \\"liberal opposition\\", \\"liberal detractors\\", and \\"liberal government leaders\\". All presumably part of the evil Hannity wants to deliver us from.<br /><br />Hannity is a fanatical Bush devotee. While he claims that he is \\"no blind supporter of President George W. Bush. I have often criticized his domestic policies, and I don't believe he is perfect\\" However, Bush is \\"the right man in the right place at the right time\\", one of \\"our greatest modern presidents\\", our \\"leader\\", a \\"powerful leader\\", a \\"masterful crisis president\\".<br /><br />Hannity even has the nerve to claim that Bush is a \\"defender of our liberties\\" even though we all know that Bush has made war on the Bill of Rights. Even BUsh's less rabid supporters acknowledge that we have temporarily sacrifice some civil liberties in this \\"war against our freedoms\\" I'm sure it won't stop with the USA PATRIOT act. PATRIOT II will be assured of passage if Bush wins. Just how that squares with being a \\"defender of our liberties\\" is unclear.  As James Bovard points out: \\"Nothing happened on 9/11 to make the Constitution null and void. Unleashing the government does not make us safe.\\"<br /><br />Sean also ignores the fact that Republicans have for all practical purposes controlled Congress since 1994 The makes the Republicans responsible for virtually every piece of bad legislation passed during the last ten years. Not to mention many ofthe worst of the judicial activists niminated and appointed.<br /><br />Hannity is liberal ( may I say that?) with his criticisms of Clinton for not being tough enough with Saddan Hussein, yet is silent about Reagan and Bush I's business dealings with him and not even mentioning them supplying him with all those nasty weapons during the Iran war. ( We know Hussein had WMD's, we have the reciepts.)<br /><br />Hannity laments that \\"American soldiers are in harm's way in all corners of the world\\", but never even thinks to question what in the world our troops are doing \\"in all corners of the world\\" and how that squares with our supposed \\"dedication to liberty\\"? These questions are unaswered in his book.<br /><br />Hannity displays his own ignorance of American history by appealing to James Madison and warns against \\"unquestioned loyalty to the state\\", \\"the dictates of the state\\", and serving the state. Apparently he doesn't realize that war is the health of the state? People will do anything for the state in time of war - including this war. Hannity is the patron Saint of \\"unquestioned loyalty to the state\\" at least while Bush is in office.<br /><br />Incredibly, Hannity mentions George Washington's warning in his Farewell Address against America having \\"entangling alliances\\" to persuade his readers to vote for Bush in the November election.<br /><br />Sean is no friend of the United Nations but sure doen;t mind harping about Husseins violations of UN resolutions. If that is a justification fir war then why aren't we invading Isreal? They've violated many more UN resolutions than Saddam ever thought of.<br /><br />Naturally in this book Sean never points out, as Congressman Ron Paul did, that the Congressional resolution authorizing the president to invade Iraq \\"mentions the United Nations 25 times, yet does not mention the Constitution once.\\"<br /><br />After putting the book down after 2 days of hard reading I think I better understand the neoconservative viewpoint and I don't like it. Sean knows how to push buttons involing the Founding Fathers numerous times in the text but at the same time ignoring much of their writing.<br /><br />If you love George W. Bush, this book will make you feel good. I get the impression that Sean would be the biggest cheerleader for the state should the threat of \\"imminent attack against our democratic process\\" should \\"force\\" the adminstration into postponing elections in Novemeber as a \\"safety precaution\\" -Google that - it has been mentioned.<br /><br />All in all I gave this book 2 stars. It is well written and effective in it's aim. Unfortuately the research is flawed and heavily biased. I wished Hannity has been a little more \\"Fair and Balanced\\" I do notice that Sean is less outrageous on his TV show, I guess he doesn't want to leave himself too open for counter jabs by Alan Colmes. Perhapes he should have let Alan review the book before he published it, it may have ended up less outrageous and made his case better.

US	52658227	R1FHGWZKDFL7P	0553801430	977865510	By the Light of the Moon	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Verbose	This novel seemed more like a lesson in creative metaphors and description and less of a mystery-action-adventure in Koontz's usual style.<br /><br />I did enjoy the premise which I will not give away here. But here the author brings together three people \\"altered\\" without their consent into a realtionship that is intriguing to say the least.<br /><br />Two are brothers, one anm artist ands his autstic brother and one is merely a bystander a woman comic doing the hotel circuit in the southwest sucked in by pure chance.<br /><br />Now they are persued by a mysteroius grouop bent on killing them as quickly as possible, they go on the run while trying to deal with the results of their \\"alteration\\".<br /><br />The book has some fine moments like the scene where they are being shot at by the persuers and their only chance for survival is the autistic brother who is locked in a mental loop over \\"ice\\". This was a great sceen but overall I was a little disappointed that the brothers obsession with ice was not what saved them This was amissed opportunity for something really cool. I was expecting a nice surprise here and didn't get it.<br /><br />Times in the story Koontz explores the limits of verbosity ad I keep muttering - hey, get to the point here I don't need 2 paragraphs to describe a candle. Get on with it. Absent all the long winded descriptions the book would have been half the size and had more room for story. It needed more story and less hot air.<br /><br />The ending was unique to say the least and opens the door for a sequel. I don't think I would enjoy sequel and hope the author leaves it as it is.<br /><br />All in all not bad but no where near Koontz's best and lame when put next to classics like \\"Lightning\\", \\"Strangers\\", \\"Watchers\\" and \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\".	2004-10-10

Nothing from the Wefare state to the FDA, the Drug War and overall regulation escapes Higgs' scrutiny.<br /><br />There is something here for everyon and I plan to pass my copy to as many people as possible including my daughters college friends as an antidote to their years of being brainwashed.<br /><br />If you've veer wondered whether all these big expensive and liberty-destroying federal programs are worth it or can ever work, Higgs will certainly cure you of any doubts.<br /><br />The chapter of the FDA is alone worth the price of the book as many of my friends all use the FDA as the one thing that the federal government does right and we cannot live without. Higgs exposes that for the sad joke that it is. In reality the FDA had killed many more people than they've ever saved. Despite years of testing and hundreds of millions od dollars prescription drugs still kill thousands ( Voixx was approved by the FDA then recently pulled ) at the same time tens of thousands are dying while potential life saving drugs are denied patients by the FDA rules - all in the name of safety!<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that Higgs exposes the underlying issues without his own poitical axe to grind, and he is willing to give credit where credit is due. Overall his attack is relentless and his arguments very convincing. Even the most rabid Demo-publican will not be able to factually dispute anything presented here. Like Bovards works, this book is meticulously researched.<br /><br />Read this and it will become intuitively obvious to the most casual observer the futility of government action. Think of this book as a bull$h** vaccine.

Presumably these plans will be backed up military force as always.<br /><br />It apears as if Thomas Barnett has never bothered to examine the history of government programs - and the sad record of failure after failure after failure. It isn't just the War on Drugs or the War on Poverty or the War on Illiteracy that has failed to fulfill its promises. There hasn't been a single American war in this century or the last in which the U.S. government actually achieved the results that were promised when it went to war.<br /><br />For example: WWI was to bring democracy to all the countries of the world and a new world order that would end wars forever. The actual result: American entry into the war prevented the two sides from negotiating a just end to the war. The actual result was an expansion of the British and French empires, subjecting millions more people worldwide to foreign rule. The U.S. entry into the European war also prompted the Germans to finance and facilitate Lenin's takeover of Russia - creating the Soviet Union. And the oppressive peace terms imposed on the German people caused them to accept a thug named Adolf Hitler as their avenging angel.<br /><br />World War II was fought to liberate Europe and China, and impose peace upon the world.The actual result: Half of Europe was controlled by the Soviet Union, and China was quickly taken over by the Communists.<br /><br />The Cold War was to free subjugated countries. The actual result:  The U.S. government imposed or assisted dictators in Panama, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Cuba, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, China, South Korea, South Vietnam, the Philippines, and numerous countries in Africa.<br /><br />The Korean War was to save South Korea from being taken over by an oppressive dictatorship. The actual result: South Korea was left in the hands of an oppressive dictatorship.<br /><br />The Vietnam War was justified to save Indochina from Communism, and prevent dominos from falling all over the world. The actual result: Indochina was overrun by communists. (the world didn't come to an end.)<br /><br />The Panamanian War was to stop Panama from being a conduit for drug-running.The actual result destroyed the Panamanian army, leaving the country a haven for drug-running.<br /><br />The First Iraq War Objective was to free Kuwait and stop Saddam Hussein from taking over the world. The actual result: Kuwait is still run by a family dynasty that has no interest in democracy or in providing rights for the people. Apparently, Saddam Hussein wasn't stopped from his diabolical plans of world domination - at least according to George H.W. Bush's son.<br /><br />The Bombing of Serbia Objective was to end the ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo, perpetrated by the Serbs. The actual result was that the Albanians ethnic-cleansed all the Serbs and gypsies out of Kosovo, as well as terrorizing the Macedonians in Macedonia.<br /><br />The War in Afghanistan Objective was to stop the country from harboring terrorists, get rid of the Taliban, create human rights for women, and establish a free Afghanistan. The actual result: Al-Qaeda operatives continue to function there, and Osama Bin Laden himself may be safely hiding in Afghanistan. Women are still treated as tools and as for freedom, the Afghan people are subjugated by brutal warlords, and the Taliban have been invited back in to help restore order.<br /><br />The War in Iraq Objective was to \\"disarm\\" Saddam Hussein and liberate the Iraqi people. The actual result: Well it turns out that there was nothing to \\"disarm.\\" and over 10,000 Iraqi deaths later, Iraq is not only not liberated, it's being occupied by a foreign power that's being fought by a determined resistance movement.<br /><br />So while Mr. Barnett's objectives may be attractive, they are irrelevant - since the odds against the U.S. government actually achieving them are at least 1000 to 1.<br /><br />The Pentagon will try to export rule-sets to other countries, with no success (rule-sets that, incidentally, don't apply in the U.S.).

Here P.J travels the world and examines the best and worst of the worlds economies with an attempt to make some sense out of the whole thing.<br /><br />He travels around the world from the new Russian Republic, to Sweden, Cuba, Hong Kong and more. Chapters are titled: \\"Good Socialism - Sweden\\", \\"Bad Socialism - Cuba\\", \\"How to Make Everything from Nothing - Hong Kong\\" in PJ's own unique and hilarious style. The section on Russia should have you rolling off the chair and still understanding how the mighty USSR self-destructed.<br /><br />The funny thing is when you're done you will understand economics which is the process by which we allocate scarce resources and try ot improve our lives.<br /><br />O'Rourke looks at it all and pulls no punches.<br /><br />This is fun and interesting reading for anyone with curiosity about how economies work - and often don't work and why. If government could command an economy to work then the Soviet Union should have been the premier economic power on Earth. Why weren't they? Well, because a command economy cannot possibly work. The book helps the reader understand why.<br /><br />An example: (Pg 142) \\"The trouble wasn't that factory managers disobeyed orders. The trouble was that they obeyed them precisely. If a shoe factory was told to produce 1000 shoes, it produced 1000 baby shoes because they were the cheapest and easiest to make. If it was told to produce 1000 mens shoes, it made them all one size. If it was told to produce 1000 shoes in a variety for men, women and children, it produced 998 baby shoes, one pump and a wing tip. If it was told to produce 3000 pounds of shoes it produced one enormous pair of concrete sneakers.\\"<br /><br />This problem is not limited to shoe factories. USA take note; this will be the problem when the government takes over health care.<br /><br />The authors observations are made from a more libertarian free-market perspective and most readers when finished with this book if most will have a new respect for the workings of a free and unregulated market and understand completely why the Cubans with plenty of natural resources are starving and how there can be so damn many Roll's Royces in Hong Kong, an island with no resources other than a population willing to work and government willing to stay out their way so thay can.<br /><br />Micheal Mooore - stay away from this book it will throw you into anaphylactic shock.

This book is too dry.<br /><br />Some folks may use the fact this this book is a not very vivid put-down of Mikey-boy as evidence that his positions are stronger than they really are and difficult to criticize. \\"Hey is the the best you can do?\\"<br /><br />This seemed like a rushed work and I was expected something better reaseacrhed and constructed like perhaps a James Bovard book. If the author had followed that model this book would have deserved at least 2 more stars.<br /><br />There is nothing here you can't get on the authors web site - a site I highly recommmend.<br /><br />I read it, it put me to sleep. Try harder next time or let Bovard turn his razor wit to Mikey-boy, not that would be a real hoot and a book well worth reading	2004-09-28

Most of the information and ancdotes here have been reported all over internet news sites for years.<br /><br />I'd have to say that the book is rather lame and uninteresting especially as another reviewer pointed out from an insider perspective. I would have expected much much more and Hillary Clinton lover or hate her should have had elicted many many more interesting stories than this sad little tome. I am sure Mr's Clinton is a lot more interesting than the author made her out to be - be that good or bad.	2004-09-28

Ici Valmet\\"  words that will forever be a part of thriller lore from one of the best stories of a master storyteller. Words immortalized in what I thought was the king of all thrillers - \\"The Day of the Jackal\\".<br /><br />\\"Avenger\\" is much like his earlier work - maybe too much like it. Thats why I hit him one star down. For any other writer this would be 5 stars easily. With Forsyth, we expect much and Forsyth usually delivers.<br /><br />The pages will fly by. Each chapter merely whets your appetite for the next as the plot and the plans unfold. I said plan(s), as in plural.<br /><br />In the tradition of \\"Day of the Jackal\\" Cal Dexter, the Avenger is after Zoran Zilic, the killer of his clients only grandson a relief worker in Serbia. He is hired to bring Zilic to justice to answer for his crimes. Zilic is hiding on a remote island with an army of bodyguards and protected by the local military dictator. Zilic also has a \\"guardian angel\\". Dexters work is cut out for him.<br /><br />We have a classic cat and mouse scenario. The bad guys know the Avenger is coming thanks to his guardian angel. Dexter must use every skill and trick learned as a Viet Nam \\"Tunnel Rat\\" to accomplish his mission and survive the encounter.<br /><br />I docked this book 1/2 star for making Dexter a little too smooth. Things maybe were a little easier than they should have been for him. The endless perfect passports for one thing stretched credibility just a little. I docked him another 1/2 star for maybe being a little too reminiscent of \\"Jackal\\".<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is the work of a master, and I can't imagine any thriller fan being disappointed with it. Those who have read Forsyth before will recognize his style, and maybe wish he had stretched himself just a little more. This book is not as good as \\"Jackal\\" in my opinion (which is sure to garner a few \\"not helpful\\" votes), but make no mistake this is an excellent book but I believe Forsyth to be capable of better.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.	2004-09-14

According to the author, during WWII the US West Coast was so vulnerable to Japanese invasion and sabotage that it was necessary for the government to lock up US citizens of Japanese descent in internment camps and confiscate their property.<br /><br />This book is a thinly veiled attempt to put President Bush's own internment camps into historical perspective. However all this book does is showcase the authors own ingnorance of history, miltary strategy and logistics.<br /><br />No credible military historian or anyone else with a passing knowlege of military tactics would ever try to justify what Roosevelt did to these loyal American citizens. The idea that Japanese-Americans were a threat to the West Coats of the US is so ridiculous it is not even worth mentioning as a joke.<br /><br />As far as the threat of sabotage goes, the US had 10 times the number of aircraft carriers and five time as many destroyers and hundreds of times as many airplanes as the Japanese had. The thought of any sabotage or mayhem having a significant affect on the US war effort is unbelieveably ignorant.<br /><br />The Japanese invasion theory is so laughable as to not even warrant a semi-serious suggestion. Just look what it took for the US and the Allies to invade France: thousands of ships and airplanes to invade a country less than 100 miles away, and the Japanese would somehow be able to invade California from halfway around the world! No one in the US miliary establishment ever even mentioned the serious possibility of any kind of Japanese invasion. The very idea was way too outlandish to even waste time discussing.<br /><br />No, the Japanese-American internment has nothing whatsoever to do with any threat, real or perceived by these Americans who were betrayed and backstabbed by FDR and his band of criminals.<br /><br />As a contribution to historical debate, well maybe you can use it as a bludgeon (it weighs several pounds - compressed bull droppings) to hit your debating opponent over the head with but content wise it is worthless. The author seems to go to great pains to make silly and unsupportable statement about military logistics that anyone with a modicon of knowledge of the subject would recognize as ridiculous.<br /><br />Malkin who based on her editorial columns, is an unabashed defender of George W. Bush and the security state seems to have another goal here. I think the entire purpose of this book is to try to convince people that the governments current internment camps are as necessary as the ones previously used to imprison American citizens of the wrong color in WWII. In that point I am in 100% agreement. This book isn't politically incorrect. It's just idiotic.ating opponent over the head with but content wise it is worthless.

I came to the Amazon site to write what I thought would be a fair review. Instead of the original review I had planned to write analyzing the chapters and the authors contentions I decided instead to address an editorial review at the top of the listing. I just finished reading the review from the Reed Business Information who accuse the author of writing a philosphical attack piece and not a historal analysis.<br /><br />The reviewer claims: \\"...the author's notes and bibliography give the game away. There are scarcely any references to works of history.\\"<br /><br />I view this book as an original work looking at history without merely parroting the more mainstream historians. I think contempory history writers overly rely on others work for example DiLorenzos book on Lincoln certianly did not just re-hash the same old St Abraham diatribes. DiLorienzo produced a truly original work or scholarship. This book is the same, it is truly original and ground breaking in many ways. There may be little new material here, but the author puts the information together to for what really is \\"The Untold History of our Country.\\"<br /><br />It looks at US History from an Austrian economics perspective. I think he presents his case strongly even if he may not agree with many of the mainstream traditional historians who in my opinion are incapable of truly original scholarship.<br /><br />DiLorenzo is breath of fresh air in the market of history and his talent is sorely needed today in academia to stir the pot a little. Academia today seems mainly to consist of a small of group of \\"authorities\\" who all seem to write the same things and laud each others works and never wish to challenge the status quo.<br /><br />I will always look forward to more works from this excellent writer.	2004-08-29

Bush came to the presidency promising prosperity, peace, and humility. Instead, Bush has spawned record federal budget deficits, launched an unnecessary war, and made America the most hated nation in the world. Bush is expanding federal power and stretching prerogatives in almost every area that captures his fancy. Though Bush continually invokes freedom to sanctify himself and his policies, Bush freedom is based on boundless trust in the righteousness of the rulers and all their actions.\\"<br /><br />As with most of Bovard's books you'll want to pick it up every page or so and toss it out the window from frustration or better yet toss a few politicians and bureaucrats out the window.<br /><br />Is Bovard the only one who sees all this? There is nothing in this book that is not public record. Other critics like Michel Moore snipe from the sidelines and mostly rant hysterically, but James Bovard lays out his case like I like my bourbon - straight-up.<br /><br />Using the same seucessful formula as his other works Bovard lays out his case, fills in the background, applies logic and common sense then backs up every statement with an example or several; enough to make his case virtually irrefutable.<br /><br />Bovard explodes the myths surrounding Bush, his war, the USA PATRIOT act, his protectionist schemes to buy votes, expansions of the welfare state worthy of Lyndon Johnson, and Bush's Department of Justice [sic].<br /><br />The saddest thing about it is that after reading this you'll realize that as a whole, the Democrats are no better. They seem to be chomping at the bit to get a hold of the reins of all these new Federal powers. I'm sure the Dems will come up with even more innovative ways to expand the federal budgets and destroy our liberties - what few remain since Bush and Ashcroft effectively repealed the Bill or Rights with a bipartisan Congress enthusiastically going along.<br /><br />There may be little new ground in this work, but Bovard has done a masterful job in compiling the evidence to support his contentions. His examples and illustrations are such that you are free to draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Personally I thought \\"Lost Rights\\" and \\"Terrorism and Tyranny\\" were more complete works as this work centers mainly on the Bush Administration whereas the other works talk about the Federal Government as a whole but together they constitute a wake up call to this nation and show us that we are a crossroads.<br /><br />Do we take the road to fascism and tyranny or is it time to re-evaluate ourselves as nation and a people and consider what made the United States so special. Is our grand experiment in liberty finally over - liberty failed, or can we bring ourselves back from the brink and re-establish the US as a beacon for freedom and prosperity?<br /><br />Remember, every other fascist and socialt nation on Earth either has already self-destructed or is already falling down the black hole. Do we allow the nation to continue along its path and try to start anew after the inevitable collapse it being to late to save it?<br /><br />It's our choice.

If you hate the current occupant of the White House and end up getting in arguments with your friends and family about how you should be patriotic and uspport out president this book will give you some ammunition to hold up your side of the argument.<br /><br />I wish it had been titled differently as it is a better book than you might expect from the cover. Authoer Huberman does a credible job laying out tall the reasons why he thinks Bush doesn't belong on Pennsylvania Avenue.<br /><br />I guess bias seems inescapable in a book so provacatively titled but it is more readable and credible than most of Micheal Moore's hysterical rantings.<br /><br />In my opinion Jame Bovard lays out a better case in \\"The Bush Betrayal\\". If you were going to read one book that lays out the case against our fratboy president go for Bovard. If you can't get enough of the Bush bashing, this is decent followup to Bovards work even though it covers much of the same ground.	2004-08-26
US	52658227	R2WS29VSH0SY60	0312123337	370636036	Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty	Books	5	18	20	N	Y	Another Bovard Bulls-eye	One thing about Bovard, he makes an assertion, talks about the issue then drowns you in examples. I see where anbother reviewer has criticized Bovards use of anecdotal evidence saying that it is the weakest evidence. This is nonsense. When you are citing examples of goverment incompetence and abuse ther is no other kind of evidence other than by example. These are the cases that prove the point. I don't think we can do double-blind governemnt tyranny studies. I would be interested to know what kind of eveidence that reviewer would consider to be acceptable. Perhaps if the Army Corps of Engineers declared a puddle in his backyard to be a wetland and bulldoze his house - oh but that would be just another anecdote. Help me out here.<br /><br />In addition, I think the other reviewer missed the point of whole book. Yes, Bovard cites files lawsuits but he also cites plenty of examples where judges have ruled in favor of the plaintiff, then cited examples of what can only be judicial incompetence or legal ignorance. The courts today are far from being the protector of our rights even if the occasional judge does do the right thing, and Bovard cites enough examples of that to prove that he indeed gives credit where credit is due.<br /><br />But to the book, with Bovard's judicious use of examples and what we find is tat he builds a powerful case against the federal and in some cases local, governments. The examples he uses are all true and he by  no means cites every example, but he sure cite enough to show a distinct pattern. An indisputable pattern.<br /><br />What more powerful evidence can there be but to cite the facts of government abuse of citizens and the abrogation of the rights. There it is in black and white undeniable and irrefutable.<br /><br />I also don't agree that Bovard is a champion of government regulation of the S&L's. I think the point Bovard made in the book was that the FDIC was insuring these S&L accounts and along with that insurance should have been some rules much like when you buy auto insurance,  the insurer has the right to require certain things of you like having a drivers license.<br /><br />I think What Bovard is saying here is that stupid regulations and failure to force the S&L's to behave responsibly as a condition for the FDIC coverage was the root of the problem. What if someone said to you in Las Vegas to bet as much as you like and not to worry, that someone else will cover your losses while you will keep you winnings. Imagine anyones behavior after being made an offer like that. Thats is basically what happened with the S&L's. If the S&L wanted FDIC coverage they should have had oversight. No oversight - no FDIC. Would you put your money in a non-FDIC bank? Maybe, maybe not but at least you would aware of the risks.<br /><br />Overall Bovard makes a powerful case that no one can really challenge on the evidence. I would look forward to someone reviewing this book and citing a few examples that disprove his assertions. Yes I will accept anecdotal evidence.d have been some rules much like when you buy auto insurance,  the insurer has the right to require certain things of you like having a drivers license.  <br /> <br />I think What Bovard is saying here is that stupid regulations and failure to force the S&L's to behave responsibly as a condition for the FDIC coverage was the root of the problem.

I was aware of the CIA funding of the Afgan rebels but had no idea about the details.<br /><br />This book brings it all to life and is what good fiction should aspire to but Crile could have never gotten this published as fiction. Too outlandish they would claim.<br /><br />This story is amazing and as you read it you will be blown away at the boldness of Charlies Wilson and how he accomplished what he did. They funded the Afghan rebellion against the Russians to he tune of billions of dollars while not only keeping it a secret but batting around criticisms of the CIA for NOT helping out the rebels. Surely this was the CIA's finest hour.<br /><br />I may not agree with what they did, but it's hard to argue with success and as you read this you will come to the realization that losing the Afghan war was likely the real cause of the final collapse of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />This book is excellently written with copious footnotes. Checkt he facts at randon and you will find that Crile did his research, and spins the take like a great spy novel. There are elements that are laugh-out-loud funny and funnier than parts of of some of Carl Hiassen's novels.<br /><br />This book is billed as \\"history\\" but hell this ain't your fathers history.<br /><br />Criles characterizations will make you feel that you know the players personally.

Then gets promoted to 2nd Lt without having graduated from flight school yet?<br /><br />The Bush refuses to take a physical because there was a new requirement for a drug test? That gets his flight status dropped thus wasting the milloin or so dollars of taxpayer money spent to train him. This book is amazing.<br /><br />Then the coward has the gall to wear a flight suit and challenge the Iraqi's to &#34;bring it on&#34; when he hid under the bed drunk and stoned on coke in Texas when the Viet Cong were bringing it on!<br /><br />I am veteran and I'm disgusted.<br /><br />Good book, worth reading.

I can't imagine any fan of mysteries or thrillers being disappointed with this book.<br /><br /> A woman is found murdered in a small Kansas community. It has all the earmarks of a ritualistic serial killer. The bi=ody is mutilated and surrounded by a pattern of dead crows impaled on indian arrows - genuine and in perfect condition.<br /><br /> In appears Special agent Pendergast, known to us who've enjoyed other Preston/Child stories. Pendergats is &quot;on vacation&quot; here to act in an advisory role only.<br /><br /> Adopting thge town misfit Corrie Swanson, Pendergast begins his investigation yet things do not add up. Subsequent murders follow no logical pattern consistent with any classification of serial killer known to the FBI.<br /><br /> As the body count rises all bets are off as the novel picks up speed and the mystery deepens. The last third of this book is impossible to put down. The action moves at frenetic pace and there is where Prestion and Child really shine. As the story unlayers itself all initial assumtions go out thew window and it begins to look more and more supernatural as the suspense mounts. Could it really be the Curse of the Forty-Fives?<br /><br /> I challenge anyone to finish chapter 46 at 1am and walk through a dark house without turning on a light. Absolutely frightening!<br /><br /> From there the action doesn't let up until the next to final chapter.<br /><br /> Bravo to a masterful story. I think it is easily on par with Cabinet of Curiosities in depth of story, character development and sense of mystery. It is a different type of novel but similar enough to allow the authors to use their strengths to build a terrific weekend read. As usual, Preston and Child deliver.<br /><br /> Highly recommended.	2004-07-23

I even use ot more than my vi book.<br /><br />The raw power of sed and awk will humble even the proudest VB programmer and this book will help you get the most out of both the \\"Aho, Weinberg and Kernigan\\" and the \\"stream editor\\".<br /><br />The first chapter section is entitled \\"May You Solve Interesting Problems\\" a paraphrase of the old Chinese curse, but with sed and awk no problem seems insurmountable and will make all problems appear interesting.<br /><br />This book is an outstanding reference and will get you up and running with both of these handy little programs in no time.<br /><br />Just to give you an example - the first time I ever used these programs (sed and awk) I developed a cron script to query a database every day at midnight, sort the results, grabbed lines with tagged values within certain limits, added a few totals, did some averaging, \\"starred\\" the lines that departed from certain parameters, then formatted the results into a report with a header showing the dates, times and query results, statistics then packed them into a report file and e-mailed them to a dozen recipients and added a few recipients if the data was outside certain values.<br /><br />I did this remarkable feat by copying a few examples from the book, changing a thing or two and in the end had a little shell script that was a few K-bytes at the most.<br /><br />This VB guy from corporate worked on a VB version of the same function and ended up with six revisions, several megs in the executable and never was able to get it formatted right. Not to say that it couldn't be done but..... I wrote mine before lunch one day. He worked on his for weeks and weeks.<br /><br />Such is the power contained within should you want to tap it Grasshopper.<br /><br />Great book. Amaze your friends and colleagues. Have the office women ( or men)  throw flowers at your feet as you enter every day - well maybe not, but this will make you more productive.<br /><br />You real nerds will hardly get finished with a single box of Pop Tarts before you are writing really cool scripts when using this book.<br /><br />Like all O'Reilly books this one is terse, practical and highly usable - just like UNIX.ly get finished with a single box of Pop Tarts before you are writing really cool scripts when using this book.

I even relate myself a little with Pitt having had a not dissimilar background and interestes, not to mention green eyes. In short I have been a loyal Cussler reader for as many years as Clive has been writing.<br />That being said......<br />I theorized in an earlier review that Cussler has developed an ingenious computer program to write his novels for him. I think there is a database of  descriptive metaphors, names and evil plots with another database of georgraphy and history.<br />This program randonly selects items from the database and inserts them into a pre-written structure that follows the &quot;NUMA&quot; formula.<br />Let the CPU's churn for a few trillion cycles and Bammo a new book all ready for the publisher.<br />After reading White Death I am more convinced them ever that I am right on the mark.<br />This book is exactly like I described. A pat formula, change a few names, reuse some metaphors, grab a few odd historical details sprinkle in soem geographical descriptions and you have a novel that is basically like every other that Clive and Paul have co-written ( or co-programmed ).<br />I could not get enthusiastic about this book since through the whole thing I felt that I had read it before. You know what I mean, you read a book then years later forgot you read it, re-read it and through the whole thing you say to yourself that I have seen this before. I know what will happen next.<br />Well thats White Death. I've read it before and knew what would happen in each page.<br />I have no problem with a formula especially a good one like Dirk and Al and the Admiral and Rudi and Loren. This is a bit abusive and way too repetitive of his other novels.<br />The good thing is that you can save a lot of money. Buy this book and read it. Put it up, then when the next one comes out just re-read this one. It saves the price of the next novel.<br />I think Clive and Paul need to dump the database and get some new descriptions and ideas. After all how many evil corporations can there be inthe world all run by meglomaniacs wanting to &lt;fill in the blanks&gt;  __________ and __________, then _________ so Dirk/Kurt will ________ and well you get the idea.get some new descriptions and ideas.

It is billed as a reference for System V and Solaris 2.0 but applies well to most versions of UNIX, even Linux.<br />It is more of a command and function reference than a tutorial, in fact it is NOT a tutorial but with a little practice on a UNIX system you will find this book invaluable. I have O'Reilly books specific to vi, sed and awk, but this one is the main reference I use for looking up command structure.<br />Its the most comprehensive and usable UNIX references I have seen and compares well to the big books that cost a lot more and could prop the wheels on a DC-3.<br />This book in easily carried in an brief case for quick deployment. You can look up things quickly even when folks pop out of the room for a moment, you can look up something and be working away with your newfound information whenthey return and everyone will think you knew it all along. hahaha<br />Great book, highly recommended. I even use it for AIX although mostly for vi, se and awk.	2004-07-01

Get a taste of it yourself and you will be hooked.<br />vi is powerful beyond belief and  honestly I had been using it for years before I got this wonderful book from O'Reilly. The power of vi is revealing in this easy to use and well structured reference and learning aid.<br />Impress your friends with some of the little known and used features and functions. The authio Linda Lamb certainly knows her way around the editor so pay careful attention to the examples she uses to illustrate functions. Many of these can be used almost as-is in your daily work.<br />I suppose with all the latest WYSWYG word processors vi seems a little dated, but using vi I can create, edit, copy and manipulate documents in a fraction of the time others can by clicking and drilling in a windowed application.<br />I love vi. It's the raw power thats addicting. Yeah sometimes you can really screw the pooch with a typo but generally vi is fairly forgiving. I should know, my typing stinks but vi is generally kind to me when I mess up.<br />I rated this book highly in spite of I would have liked a few more examples, but the examples Lamb included are very representative of what you as a user may need and actually use.<br />This is a typical O'Reilly book - excellent and a worthy addition to any serious compter professionals library.<br />Hey I just heard that vi is available even to Windows lamers.<br />Try it folks, give your mouse finger a badly needed rest. Going to vi is like getting out of Chevy Impala into an Indy car. The Chevy may have better seats and A/C, but when you touch that gas pedal you'll be hooked.	2004-07-01

It really takes more than a single reading to fully absorb the information.<br />In the meanwhile I have been browsing the reviews and they seem to be divided into two camps: the first camp read the book, checked the references and kept an open mind. These people seem to rate the book highly.<br />The next group who have obviously not read the book and criticize DiLorenzo for everything up to and including halitosis and rate the book low.<br />So far I have been unable to find single negative \\"review\\" from anyone who seems to have read the book. So far I have not seen any obvious sign that any of the single star reviers have cracked the cover.

Yes this is NOT what you have learned in your government schools. Yes, this is a ugly history. Real history frequently is ugly.<br />I just read \\"Brainwashed\\" and its funny that the reviews of this book support Shapiros conention that schools brainwash students and suppress debate on most subjects and that instead of real debate, authorities resort to personal attacks against the messenger.<br />They never question or debate the facts. Not once in a a single negative review have I seen even one \\"reviewer\\" document a single error of fact in DiLorenzo's work.<br />No one has taken a single example from the book that is demonstrably in error or even questionable. Not one.<br />This is a very good book. It is an uncomfortable book. Like most of us I was taught of Lincoln's \\"greatness\\".

Shapiro does recite a lot of examples that are impossible to explain by the reviewers who still have no idea what this book contains.<br />I have been to several colleges like the several others here. While my initial crticism of Shapiro is his limited sampling of colleges, at least they are representative of his own experiences.<br />There are plenty who le disagree with the author and I commend the &quot;single star&quot; reviewers who took the time to debate the  book. It is certainly more then you will every see in one of todays universities. Debate is prohibited or at least tightly controlled. I have seen debate points scripted by the professor and vetted by the administration. I have also seen people &quot;assigned: debating points based on &quot;what we expect you to think&quot;.<br />I do have to laugh and wonder how a person that contends that -<br /> &quot;they question every belief, every preconceived notion. To openly confront you with a situation you'd never before been face-to-face ...&quot;<br /> - can explain campus &quot;speech codes&quot;.<br />How does one reconcile -<br />&quot;  argue with your conservative beliefs and try to sway you to theirs, it's to help you either better defend and know your position ...&quot;<br /> - with the censorship of The Daily Barometer at the University of Oregon and the firing of the  columnist David Willimans who dared to &quot;question preconcieved notions.&quot;<br />The most interesting thing I have noticed here is the the negative reviewers have not in a single instance attempted to refute or explain a single example cited by Shapiro.<br />I wonder why?	2004-06-11

This book seems to have struck a few nerves here.<br />I saw one that referred to this book as &quot;Paranoid Right-Wing Perspective of Education&quot; going on to say: &quot;There is no tolerance among right-wing extremists for anyone to get a different viewpoint&quot;.<br />Actually the truth is the exact opposite. It is the leftist colleges who do not tolerate any other viewpoints. While preaching &quot;tolerance&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; they suppress any debate that challenges the established leftist positions.<br />Debate is where you refine your arguments and I have often learned as much from my debating opponents as from my partners, maybe more. In todays schools debate is all but prohibited - well no, actually is prohibited. When you confront the establishment view or the politically correct view you are immediatelt labeled a &quot;racist&quot;, or &quot;mean spirited&quot;, perhaps you are a mysoginistic dinosaur or  an evil oppressor who worships &quot;dead white males&quot;. <br />No debate, no discussion especially if you confront the PC crowd with inconsistencies in their arguments. They refuse to defend themselves or their positions. They will just scream invictives and shout you down.<br />It's pathetic really and embarassing. <br />Shapiro has done a wonderful job exposing the truth in todays colleges. Bravo Ben - also very brave.	2004-06-10

The size and scope of the Federal behemoth is growing by the day. Laws such as the PATRIOT ACT are shredding the freedoms that we hold so dear and our government is had embarked on a war of agression against a country that was never any threat to us. Our sons and daughters are dying half a world away for the glory of arrogant rich kids with dreams of conquest. REMFS and chickenhawks sending others to die who were unwilling to do so themselves.<br />This book will give you hope. Lew Rockwell sees the good in everything. This collection of speeched given by Rockwell address everything from freedoom to sound money, and Lew has this incredible ability to expose the silver lining where we all see clouds.<br />This is wonderful book and a rich source of quotations.<br />Read Lews speeches and get the messages he sends. All is not lost. There are good things happening and reasons to be optimistic. If you ever doubted the power of liberty and freedom, read this book and you will find yourself encouraged.<br />Lew is conistent in his dedication to freedom and the principles this county was founded on.<br />Like Fred Reed says: &quot;I love America, I would move there if I could find it.&quot;<br />Find it here.	2004-06-03

This one I could not resist.<BR>I trolled through it at Barnes and Noble and read half of it in an afternoon. I had to buy it and finish it.<BR>Well I finised last night and debated whether to think about it for day or go ahead and review.<br />No need to re-hash the premise here but author Shapiro makes a powerful case that todays college students are basically brainwashed by todays liberal professors. He uses plenty of examples, but I suppose we as the reader must assume that these are representative samples.<br />It been a long time simce I attended school at yes folks - Berkeley. From my experience there as well as a few other encounters I find mysefl having to agree with the author. Of course as long as use the \\"new\\" definition of \\"liberal\\". These days liberals are considered communists, socialists and/or fascists. <br />I agree with one reviewer in that I think the colleges are not liberal enough - using the the classical definition of \\"liberal\\" - that is based on the root word of \\"liberty\\" and that students and professors should have the \\"Liberty\\" to freely discuss and explore in any direction.<br />I agree with the author that this is just the opposite of the current situation at most universities. The ones I have had dealings with are probably the most repressive institutions this side of the old Soviet Union re-education camps.<br />Free discussion of the issues is all but prohibited at most of todays universities and our society os the poorer for it. Dissention is generally shouted down buy mindless chanting such as seen one time whwn John Stossel wanted to interview some students about \\"date rape\\". Questions were prohibited and Stossel was shouted down by a mob of screaming students chanting the same slogan over and over. I was embarassed and ashamed that foreigners may have been watching the show and wondering what hell we are doing - or worse not wondering. Intelligent speakers suchas Thomas Sowell have experienced the same thing as have others who dare depart from the PC party line.<br />It is no mystery why our society is in decline if this is state of higher education today.<br />This is an important book and should be read by every parent with children close to college age. Todays college students are generally unprepared for the world and this inability to reason for themselves is a big part of the problem. No wonder that the number of foreign educated scientists and engineers is syrocketing. The leftists ( as opposed to the classical liberals such as myself ) have destroyed higher education in this country and failed in their misison to educate the next generation.<br />If anyone is in doubt about Shapiros contentions, merely have a conversation with a non-techical college student. Ask a question - get a slogan. Many are like the little dolls with the string and ring and a little record inside. <br />This is sad state of affairs and chronicled in a pointed and important book by Shapiro. I highly recommend this book. I wish he had used  few more examples since his critics have used that to say his data is not representative. I give this one 4 1/2 stars, round it off to 5 for the Ivy League graduates incapable of understanding fractions - haha just kidding.<br />This book is interesting and refreshingly honest. All should enjoy Shapiros wit and his pointed observations. Good work Ben. Highly recommended.	2004-05-25

I suppose it is fashionable to use the review section to offer commentary about something the writer is admittedly ignorant of. I find that is also true that some anonymous \\"readers\\" also like to use this space to review other reviewers from the same position of ignorance.<br />I'm not sure what about my review led said anonymous \\"reader\\" to make assumptions and this reader would probably be surprised to learn that this reviewer happens to have combat experience and is not likely to rejoice is the death or injury of anyone much less one of my grandchildren.<br />In fact those soldiers are not statists, just brave young people who volunteered to defend this country as I did, and were duped as I was. I cry for every one who doesn't come home. I have to, I have know way too many of them.<br />In fact this reviewer was pubic educated but at a time before the schools engaged in wholesale brainwashing. These were more innocent times I suppose.<br />I guess I have little patience with REMF's and chickenhawks willing to send others to die for politics yet not willing to do the same themselves. This assesement includes the current comander in chief ( who hid out in Texas - safely far away from the Ho Chi Minh trail ), the defense secretary and assorted flunkies, the vice commander and just about everyone else in the adminstration. <br />I stand by my opinion that anyone who thinks this book and Lew Rockwell are in any way anti American and that one who thinks so is either ignorant from the non-exposure to real history versus PC nonsense or has drank the Kool Aid.<br />Again, this book celebrates the REAL America. It is sad commentary that too few people recognize it.<br />Anyone who says that this book \\"rejoices in Amercias defeat\\" or that it anti-American either has not read the book or is so hopelessly infected with statism that he or she is incapable of any independant thought.<br />Possibly they are all the poor unfortunate victims of government education so we can't be too hard on them - it's not their fault.<br />This the most pro-American book I have ever read. It rejoices in America's virtues and what this country is supposed to stand for.<br />Freedom and liberty were the principles this nation was founded on. This book tells us of the REAL America and the REAL America is just not about more efficiently bombing the wogs halfway around the world. No intelligent patriot one could look at what the Bushies atre doing to Iraq and say that is what America is all about.<br />This book is about real patriotism not the phony flag-waving and oppression of the Bush Administration or more correctly the Cheney-Rove-Rumsfeld adminstration of which dear old shrub is the point man on strings.<br />I would recommend this book for anyone. If you read it with an open mind you will be enlightened. Enlightened not brainwashed.<br />Far from rejoicing ion Americas defeat, this book celebrates America. My America. The one I want back.	2004-05-19

This book mainly rehashes old myths about capitalism that have been proven wrong over and over again for decades.<br />Moore attributes anything he doesn't like or understand to the evils of what he calls \\"C-A-P-I-T-A-L-I-S-M\\". Funny he doesn't seem to mind it when collecting his book royalties, but lets leave that for now.<br />An example from the book is the so-called California \\"energy crisis\\" Moore rants that this was a failure of capitalism because the energy shortages came after \\"deregulation\\". Unfortunately for Moore, California never deregaulted the energy market. They may have called it that, but in reality they re-regulated it heavier than it had been before and outlawed the very mechanisms that would have provided for a stable and inexpensive energy supply. The market was interfered with and manipulated by politicians and the results were exactly as expected. Stupid white men allright with Moore and Gray Davis holding the pole positions in the stupid race.<br />What blew my mind in the whole book was Moore blaming the pitful misery and poverty on the Indian reservations on the evil C-word. Had Moore bothered to do any research on this at all he would have discovered that they are miniature centrally planned, socialist economies run by the federal government's Bureau of Indian Affairs, complete with Soviet-style \\"five-year plans.\\"<br />The= resevations are the very epitome of socialism and its destructiveness. This is a test-tube for federally administered socialism and apparently exactly the way Moore would have us all live. This is socialism in practice and had worked exactly the same way in every single socialist state on Earth from the mighty Soviet Union to Cuba.<br />Not of course not for Moore and his elite buddies, he'll go move in next door to Barbara Streisand and Alec Baldwin  two massively rich folks also \\"concerned\\" for the poor. Be sure they will have their mansions and limos as we turn the rest of the country into one big federally managed Indian reservation.<br /><br />When the Indians beg for the BIA to leave them alone they build homes, factories, schools and make themselves prosperous. That is what captialism does. American Indian leaders understand that capitalism will be their economic salvation, just as the socialist hellholes called \\"reservations\\" have abused them for generations.<br />Moore also comes across as a shill for big labor.<br />Claiming to be an advocate of the \\"poor\\" Moore supports the union position by giving Nike business for hiring the poor to work in their factories enabling them to lift themselves, their familes and their communities out of grinding poverty. Nope, no can do. Moore says Nike should price these people out of the market taking away the only advantage they have to compete.  I suppose Moore likes the idea of them having to send their children to scavenge in garbage dumps and selling their daughters into prostitution.<br />Amazingly Moore even blames the problems of crime, bad schools, poverty, and governmental corruption in Washington, D.C. on \\"C-A-P-I-T-A-L-I-S-M.\\" Washington, D.C., like the Indian reservations, is an island of socialism. Its government-run schools are among the nation's worst; it is one of the highest-tax jurisdictions in America; has the largest number of local governmental bureaucrats of any city of comparable size; its police are notoriously ineffective and corrupt; and to D.C. residents the notion of \\"public service\\" is a cruel joke. This isall the result of government failure in a city that worships government.<br />In the end, after misdiagnosing nearly every social and economic problem that he writes about, showcasing his total ignorance, incorrectly blaming them on capitalism, Moore proposes bigger and bigger government and higher and higher taxation - socialism - as a sure-fire cure-all for America's ills. Talk about Stupid White Men.s all the result of government failure in a city that worships government. <br />In the end, after misdiagnosing nearly every social and economic problem that he writes about, showcasing his total ignorance, incorrectly blaming them on capitalism, Moore proposes bigger and bigger government and higher and higher taxation - socialism - as a sure-fire cure-all for America's ills.

Books	4	35	55	N	N	I finally read this book	I've been debating reading this book for a while now. I have read Duesburg's &quot;Inventing the Aids Virus&quot; and I found his case convincing. I also found the negative reviews of his book likewise interesting and informative. Mainly informative in the area of demonstrating the danger of mixing politics and science. The science half is always overshadowed by the politics - and money.<br />I enjoyed this book and regretted waiting so long to read it. She presents her case in a well thought out manner. I have read many scientific and medical papers that were nowhere near this concise and well presented.<br />This book did prompt me read further in medical literature about AIDS and HIV. I saw several negative reviews here that contend that Cristine doesn't know what she's talking about and that HIV is the &quot;proven&quot; cause of AIDS.<br />I went looking for that proof. I have been unable to find any published scientic or medical paper that demostrated or proved that HIV causes AIDS. There aee scads of papers showing a &quot;link&quot;. Those links however are all circular: they define AIDS as disease X in the presence of HIV antibodies. Disease X w/o those antobodies is just plain old disease X.<br />I looked, there is not a single paper that demonstrates that HIV causes AIDS. No paper that describes the mechanism by which the HIV virus causes to 40 or diseases. If any of the folks here who contend that HIV is the proven cause of AIDS please write down the reference. I can't find it.<br />Oddly I stumbled upon a paper that un-links Kaposi's Sarcomi as being an AIDS disease! KC has been THE definitive AIDS disease since AIDS becaase widely known.<br />I don't think Christine or anyone else is denying that people are dying, but if we wish to save their lives we had better find out whats really killing them.<br />After 20 years and untold billions of dollars, the important questions still have not been answered. Not only that but the AIDS establishment won't even debate the reasons for their failure to save a single life of an AIDS patient. What are they afraid of? They could shut up Duesburg, Maggiore and Mullis with a single debate but the AIDS industry won't do it.<br />It seems the only ones who survive an HIV infection are the people who don't treat it. They live. The patients who take AZT die. The AIDS industry won't even discuss the issue.<br />Silence and censorship always makes me suspicous.<br />This is good book. Not a great one, but a good one. I liked the personal aspects of it. Iwish she would have presented a little more of the other side of the issue if only to give us readers a few more talking points on the subject.<br />Somewhere, sometime the truth will eventually escape.

US	52658227	R1PUD7PR49SEU6	0440136482	598516960	Holy Blood, Holy Grail	Books	3	15	19	N	N	Fun to read but unconvincing	I just finished this book and I had to sit down and think about what I thought about it if that makes any sense. It should to anyone who has already read it.<br />For someone who has not it is a good a description about what to expect  from the book as anything else I can say.<br />I love books like this actually. Ancient secrets, conspiracies, secret societies, suppressed documents, hidden truths all make for fascinating reading.<br />This appears to be the book that inspired The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown. I have read that book and aside from Browns tendency to invent things and pass them off as truths is a bit excessive even for a novelist it is a good adaptation of this theory.  But getting back to this book the authors obviously did a lot of research and include a lot of interesting history in the course of presenting their theory.<br />The theory being essentially that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross, but somehow survived either by toughing it out or using a decoy - a man willing to sacrifice his life for Jesus. Which one. Obviously both could not have happened, but the research shows it could have been either. This in short<br />describes well the problems I have woth the book.The authors own theories have contradictions and they make little attempt to sort them out.<br />According the authors, Jesus was married to Mary Magdalen or Mary of Bethany or both or they were the same woman or perhaps some other, agaion the &quot;evidence&quot; is unclear. Jesus was rich, Jesus was poor, which, well both and neither according to this book.<br />Supposedly after the crucifixion, Jesus' wife and child escaped to Gaul (France) thereby  continuing the royal bloodline through the Merovingians and even into the present day. They theorize that ancestors of Jesus are living today and may still have a claim to the Merovingian throne.<br />These truths are speculated to be in the possesion of the Priory of Sion, a secret society dating back form the time of the Knights Templar. The authors produce evidence of this is the form the &quot;Dossiers Secret&quot; found in the French archives. Using this document as a base the researched the history of the Templars and the Priory and uncovered odd goings on through history.<br />Giving the authors credit, there is little documentation available through conventional channels and they dug and researched to come up with a credible theory. Having a credible theory howeverin no way suggests they have uncovered the truth.<br />The authors admit that they did a lot &quot;reading between the lines&quot;. While this can be a legitimate research tool, anything determined by supposition should be backed up by some kind of evidence and just more supposition. Here is where they seem to be lacking. I am not saying that the theory is not true I<br />am certainly not qualified to make the determination, but I was not convinced.<br />I noticed the authors getting stuck in several traps of fallacy.<br />The authors went to great lengths to show that much in the 4 Gospels of the New Testament is contradictory and open to debate. There is no question that the gospels are missing things or perhaps we suffer from a lack of context of the times.  In any event they authors have decided that the gospels have been edited, massaged and manipulated over the centuries. The authors have studied works contempory to the gospels and found discrepancies. The biggest problem I noticed was they assumed anything not in the Gospels had to be more accurate than what was included in them.<br />For example; the authors supposed that the Gospels were edited to make them more palatable to the Romans. Okay then why would another document necessarily be more accurate merely because was written to an Egyptian  audience. If a Roman document was massaged to protect the sensibilities of the Romans why wouldn'y an Egyptian document be written so as not to offend Egyptians. They didn't apply the same standards across the board.<br />It  was if they assumed the Gospels were always in error whenever a discrepancy showed up.<br />The authors use these leaps in logic to make an assumption, then expand on that assumption finding small bits of text that concur with the theory. They then continue on their merry way ignoring what doesn't support the theory, and grabbing any tiny shred based mainly on &quot;what if&quot;.<br />In all fairness I am not saying their theory is not true, but I take issue on the techniques they used. They have not proved their case or even convniced me they have a case. They have innundated he reader with historical minutae and I think confused the issue.<br />I am guessing that someone could just about make any statement about happenings 2000 years ago and find evidence to support it. I could probably theorize that Jesus was an alien and find just as much supporting evidence as the authors have for their ideas.<br />If you don't examine evidence that tends to dispute it you have only done half the job. The authors have only done half a job.<br />I can recommend this book for anyone curious about these theories. These =stories and rumors are not new and are interesting to examine. I think the authors are on shaky ground here unless they examine and debunk competing evidence that does not support their theory.<br />As I mentioned, the book is interesting and I did enjoy the history of the Templars, the Crusades as well as some insight to the ancient  Holy Land.<br />Parts were somewhat tedious where the authors recount bloodlines and marriages and relationships in great big paragraphs of this and that.<br />Ohtherwise, the book is fun to read and stimulates the imagination.<br />I am not however convinced by the &quot;evidence&quot; - there was none to speak of. This book is no threat to anyones faith, just interesting reading.was if they assumed the Gospels were always in error whenever a discrepancy showed up.<br />The authors use these leaps in logic to make an assumption, then expand on that assumption finding small bits of text that concur with the theory.

It can be really annoying at times. For an author who does such thorough and accurate research into meteor geology, his ignorance of simple things becomes even more grating.<br />Here are two examples that will not spoil the novel for any who has not read it yet: It would be impossible for a 2 man sub to manhandle an 8 ton meteroite under water or otherwise. A solid mass just does not have enough bouyancy to offset the weight. The descriptions of the pressure effects on a body are total and absolute nonsense and do not really add that much drama to the story - I was too busy laughing.<br />There are plenty more, but I suppose they do not take away too much for the otherwise passable novel.<br />I like Dan Brown and I will probably read anything he writes. He is on my \\"B+\\" list. but Dan PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get a technical advisor!!! Call me, I will do it for free. PLEASE.	2004-02-20

Books	3	6	9	N	N	Don't dismiss this out of hand	I hate socialism and I think Moore is a socialist and I would not want him within a million miles of policy making.<br />That being said, Moore makes some very good points in this book -points that conservative and liberals alike need to pay attention to. Moore is not all wrong.<br />He is of course rabid anti-gun which tells me that are serious flaws in his way of reasoning specifically, but in general, Moore scores some serious points here.<br />In chapter 1, Moores askes seven questions that he would like to ask Bush. They are good questions and they all deserve answers. Of course in todays climate anyone asking these questions in public risks being classified as an enemy combatant and sent to Guantanamo Bay. Put one on a sign at a Bush public appearance and you can be arrested for departing from your &quot;certified free speech zone.&quot;<br />In Chapter 2 Moore accuses Bush of being a pathological liar. Moore cites references. Read them before you dismiss the accusations out of hand.<br />I loved Chapter 4 - &quot;The United States of Boo.&quot; He deals with the current anti-terror hysteria. In reality the chances of any American being hurt in a terrorist incident are simply too small to calculate. Your chances are probably better of being hit by a meteorite. Yet this does not stop the current adminstration from trying to create the biggest and best Banana Republic Police state on the planet. Moore correctly points that the best defense against terrorism is to quit screwing around in other peoples countries.<br />The remainder of the book is a socialist rant that advocates eating the rich and transforming the country into another Soviet Union.<br />Moore is correct in asserting that under Bush the country is going to hell in a handbasket. What he ignores is that under his preferred system we will be going to hell in a stolen shopping cart after standing in lines for toilet paper.	2004-01-14
US	52658227	R34BHSV9H6MXL4	0312263120	201960968	Digital Fortress: A Thriller	Books	3	3	9	N	N	A little disappointing	Maybe I expected too much after just finishing the DaVinci Code. DaVinci was meticulously researched and Brown revealed the whole story like he was peeling layers of an onion. I read DaVinci in one sitting. I literally could not put it down.<br />Digital Fortress was in the same vein as DaVinci. The formula is almost point for point a close of DaVinci. This is a complex mystery with believable and well developed characters. What bothered me was much of it did just did not make much sense.<br />I don't wish to spoil the novel for anyone who has not read it yet so I won't go into any of the major plot elements or twists, but for example:<br />If the NSA was supposedly stumped by an unbreakable cypher and the algorthm source code was available even if encrypted, then why would the NSA want to destroy the key and the code? If the algorthm really was unbreakable by their billion dollar beast I would have wanted to study every aspect of the code not destroy it without ever seeing it. How could they be sure there was not another copy or some other programmer would not redevelop one just like it in a year? Makes no sense, no one questioned this. Susan should have been all over it, but she insisted it be destroyed.<br />The other bothersome things was Brown supposedly used the technical advice of retired NSA cryptographers to add techincal realism. However several plot elements made no technical sense.<br />For example: If the Fortress code was posted encrypted using fortress itself, you would need more than just the passkey. You would need the Fortress program itself to decrypt it using the passkey. Just having the passkey only would not be enough. If the fortress program was available in a compiled format then the NSA could have easily (maybe not easily -but I am sure they could do it) decompiled the program to reveal the algorthm. Having the passkey would not be vital to understanding Fortress. The passkey alone would not have been enough to open up the encrypted files. Neither would a &quot;brute force&quot; attack on Fortress have ever been able to crack it. It would have to have analyzed and broken structurally. Brute force requires you to have the algorthm to begin with then you guess the passkey by using all the possible combinations. Without the Fortress program they would have had nothing with which to attack the encrypted file. If they had the Fortress program already they would have had to waste time brute forcing it. This is a Catch-22 scenario<br />This is monumental technical error and destroyed much of my enjoyment of what is a very well written thriller.<br />I will stop there as many of my other issues would be classified as &quot;spoilers&quot;.<br />Overall this was a good story but the technical errors are inexcusable in a novel written by an author of Dan Browns skill.Neither would a &quot;brute force&quot; attack on Fortress have ever been able to crack it.

The last 3-4 Pitt started a downhill plunge culminating in this piece of pulp nonsense. This was so bad it prompted me to a first. I saw a new Pitt novel available and did NOT buy it.<br />I suffered through this book and it took me a month to finish it. I would like to list through the things about it that I didn't like, but it would be a shorter list to recap what I did like about it: nothing or maybe the fact that it ended even though it felt like it would never end.<br />I like &quot;bigger than life&quot; stories that flirt with the fringe of unbelievability, but this story never did even approach anything even remotely credible.<br />The crew of the Oregon can shoot up Chinese warships with no inplications, use &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; style makeup and fly across the water with a technology that would not even pass muster for a Star Trek episode. They can call in any resource from the US Government at will, and buy off any politician as needed.<br />If these guys had a magneto-hydrodynamic drive that used no fuel and energy they could all have been multi-billionaires on the royalities instead of risking their lives - no scratch that, of course they can take on any enemy with no risk - to be mercenaries.<br />No job is too big or impossible for Juan and his folks. I kept expecting Cabillo to tear off his shirt and expose his &quot;S&quot; before taking off on the next task.<br />No character in this made any sense at all - nor did the story. No problem was too great or too easy to solve. They should have added Roy O'Bannon to the crew.<br />A typical 1964 episode of Johnny Quest was more realistic than this story and that was a freaking cartoon!<br />All right there you evil alien Pod Being, who are you and what have you done with the Clive Cussler that I used to know and love? I think I'll go re-read Iceberg and Raise the Titanic then pretend that Clive retired.ve retired.	2003-12-29

I often refer to sections of it for advice and inspiration.<br />While Lee's views on the arts may be controversial, I think that anyone who has studied the arts seriously [ this excludes the black belt factories ) can appreciate the philosophical tone of the work. Too many of us get too into dictated technique and form as well as tradition to appreciate Lee's theories.<br />Jeet Kune Do is the style that is not a style. One that is infinitely flexible and adaptable to the individual and the situation.<br />I have been a Bruce Lee fan for 30 years and while I have never had the honor of meeting him or personally seeing him in form, I have been inspired and awed by him.<br />The Tao of Jeet Kune Do is an inspired and original work and to me embodies the essense of the true martial artist.<br />They are called the \\"arts\\" for a reason. How poor would other arts be if all of the artists merely copied others - I don't mean inspired by others but COPIED others. By and large that is what the so-called kwoons teach these days.One way and one way only, for $$$$$ we guarantee a black belt in 14 months.<br />Arts by definition are intensly personal and open for interpretation. How rich would the world of culture be today if Michealangelo merely copied Davinci or Monet was discouraged to explore impressionism saying it was not \\"true art\\"?<br />Lee breaks new ground and we who study him are the richer for it.<br />I recommend this book to any one with a serious interest in the martial arts. Those of you unfortunates stuck in black belt factories please study this book; it will open a new world for you.	2003-08-02

After reading Micheal Fumento's article in Reason Magazine, I found this book able to fill in the missing pieces of the AIDS puzzle.<br />The whole thing in a tragedy. I knew a man that tested HIV positive, and reacted by swallowing a .38 slug, thinking that preferable to dying a long hard wasting death. I wish he had read this book. He was at very low risk for AIDS and probably would never have contracted the disease. The AIDS industry drove him to suicide by pronouncing HIV to be a death sentence.<br />The thing I found the most interesting about the \\"pro-HIV\\" side of the debate and the centerpiece of the HIV=AIDS theory is that the so-called evidence is all by definition. The \\"proven\\" cases of AIDS are HIV caused merely by the definition of AIDS. AIDS is defined as such and such disease (30 or so at last count) in the presence of HIV. In other words, cancer in an HIV positive patient is AIDS, the same cancer in an HIV negative patient is just plain old cancer.<br />That is the extent of the \\"evidence\\". Thats it, thats all, nothing else.<br />How about all the HIV negative AIDS patients. NO problem, change the name of the disease to ARC (aids related complex) and your \\"evidence\\" is once again solid. Read this book. Read this book. Read this book.<br />Update*****<br />I first read and reviewed this book 5 years ago, and have lost track of my copy so I just ordered another. I feel compelled to update this review after reading some of the more recents ones.<br />The burning question I had was in the face of all the evidence against the HIV=AIDS hypothesis, why are people still assuming HIV causes AIDS? The answer was revealed to me in two subsequent reviews.<br />The first is from a lady who \\"reviews\\" the book without the advantage of ever having read it. The reason the books message is wrong is because the publisher is \\"right wing\\". Since the publisher had been so labeled we are to believe that any questions raised are invalid for that reason. Never mond that Dr Duesburg is a professor at Berkely arguably one of the most liberal universities in the country if not the world.<br />This reviewer does a far better job than I ever could of illustrating the dangers of mixing politics and science.<br />Back when I was in school - back when schools actually taught academic subjects - we used to ridicule the Soviet Union for their vetting of science with politics. Hitler did the same rejecting \\"Jewish physics\\" and driving scientists like Albert Einstein into exile.<br />The AIDS \\"debate\\" is so hopelessly polluted with politics that it is unlikely the truth will ever come out in this country. Science is dead - politically correct thought is the only thought that will be accepted.<br />The other review was also startling. It was written by a pharmacist who claims to know several heterosexual males infected with HIV and dying of AIDS.<br />Here is another obvious case of a reviewer with the advantage of not being overly burdened by reading the book they are reviewing. How would this pharmacist know about the HIV infection? Could it be the AZT prescriptions? Lets see now, we are force feeding someone one of the most toxic chemicals known to man. AZT makes dioxin look like orange juice in comparison. Yet is must be the HIV making the person sick. Hey, don't bother me with the evidence I have a government brochure that says it is is HIV killing him and the AZT saving his life so it must be so.<br />There are a few scattered negative reviews none really worthy of note but they do seem to have the common thread of either attacking Duesburg personally or the folks who get their scientific information from Tom Hanks, Oprah or Barbra Streisand.<br />The point is that these negative Amazon reviews are very important and I thank the reviewers for taking their time to review a book they have never read. It underscores the importance of the book and helps the reader understand why the message is so hard to get out and why the message is suppressed in the mainstream media.er understand why the message is so hard to get out and why the message is suppressed in the mainstream media.	2003-07-30

Written in Freds unique and very eloquent style.<br />At times you don't know when Fred is departing from the literal truth and entering into the \\"Fred Zone\\". Frankly I prefer the Fred Zone it's a lot more interesting.<br />I am regular at Freds web site and look forward every week to the latest Fred on Everything column<br />Fred has a way of exposing the [falsehoods]in a way that refreshingly funny and enjoyable. His outlook on life ans attitudes are what made this country great and hopefully will again. Plus Fred will have you laughing or crying or both.<br />You will wish you could have a collection of individual essays on various always handy to give to some loudmouth know-it-all dunce running his mouth on the subject.<br />But this book, read and enjoy.

Like most people I have been brainwashed over the years about global warming and the environmental crisis. This book was quite the eye opener.<br />I wish I coujld have given it 5 stars to combat all the negative reviews by those who have never even seen a copy, but I thought \\"The Satanic Gasses\\" gave a better perspective on the psuedoscience surrounding the issue.<br />This is better if you are looking for some good talking points on the issue.<br />The book is well referenced and no one should have any trouble checking out the sources. I felt the book let enough to your own imagination where the reader could form their own opinions.<br />It is an easy read without too many deep technical discussions to spare those poor unfortunate victims of public education from having to think too hard. But then most of them would never be caught dead reading a book like his.	2003-04-30

I find it primitive in many ways and much more difficult to use than it needs to be.<br />Programmers should spend their time solving automation problems not struggling with the intracacies and peculiarities of the platform.<br />If you program with Step 7 or plan to, this book will save you a lot of headaches since little in Step 7 is as intuitive as Allen Bradley or Modicon.	2003-04-24

This book is so information rich, motivational yet extremely easy to read as well being personal. Virtually everyone reading this book will feel that personal touch from the author.<br />The philosophy does indeed work and not merely because of the dietary guidlines and workout schedules. The life philiosphy here can and will change your life if you take it to heart.<br />There are some minor gripes from people about the Myoplex references, but Bill trusts in and believes in his product, and there is not a thing wrong with that. I myself followed the program without even following totally the dietary rules. I followed the Fit for Life guidlines of fruit in the morning and food combining while avoiding processed foods like Myoplex or MetRx. I felt that my progress was better because of it, but of the combining and diets of Fit for Life is not for you, the Myoplex is a great supplement to Bills eating recommendations.<br />This is a simple book yet so powerful and deep at the same time.<br />I recommend you buy this book for anyone you care about that  needs to change their life. It will work and the pictures are real.	2003-02-20

Many of the instructions are vague and omit critical intermediate steps. On the other hand other areas seem to be written for the weekendeer, referring some repairs to a &quot;qualified profesional&quot;.<br />I much prefer the Haynes manuals. They are based on a complete teardown and describe some of the less intuitive procedures in better detail.<br />The wiring diagrams included in the book are however worth the price of the book alone. I recommend this book, but you might want to supplement it with other more detailed manuals.<br />Anyway, if you own a Z3 you will likely use this a lot. The Z3's reliability leaves much to be desired and you will need all the help you can get.	2002-01-13

Harrison is obviously a talented writer and his characterizations are excellent. This story however was unsatisfying and ultimately pointless, not to mention depressing. The violence was pointless and did not seem to add tot he plot such as it was. The sex scenes seemed overly graphic for this type of book - it is supposed to be a thriller.<br />I enjoyed many of the character developments as well as the basic premise, but the book seemed to ramble too long before getting to the critical story elements.<br />The ending was a total downer and blew away any expectations I had. The author madfe such a strong point about Charlies toughness and ability to survive, yet......<br />Sorry I cannot recommend this book. I found myself wishing this was a DVD and had an &quot;alternate ending&quot; in the bonus material.	2002-01-13

I have loved Dirk Pitt since &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; and have never missed an installment. This book however was a big disappointment for me. The story was totally beyond credibility - normal for Pitt, but this one abuses the priviledge. For Dirk, doing the impossible is now so routine it is not even fun or interesting anymore. The mechanics of the story should have been pulse-pounding, but the action sequences are stilted, mechanical and - sorry Dirk - boring. Cussler needs a new formula. Change the names and this story is exactly like the last half-dozen books. I am almost tempted to think that Cussler developed a computer program to generate out Dirk Pitt adventures. Even the descriptive metaphors sprinkled liberally throughout the book are overused and unimaginative. I guess I am a loyal Pitt fan and will always continue to read his books, but I am kind of hoping CC closes them out and retires Dirk and Al while we still have good memories of them. I did enjoy CC's attempt at Dirk's introspection. It was the best part of the book if that tells you anything about the rest of it.	2001-08-26

He has a habit of unleashing a firestorm of whenever he publishes a new book, but Gold has this annoying tendency to be right most of the time. If what Gold says is true, then even the term \\"fossil fuels\\" would have to be dropped. Gold's theory is too involved to go into in a short review but basically he contends that petroleum is promordial and currently supports biological activity in the Earth and is not the converted remains of ancient life after a few million years of decomposition. Gold presents compelling evidence that is hard to refute. In addition, these theories explain the presence of compostion of mineral enriched earth as an a few other mysteries such as the presence of helium which has been so far unexplained by conventional ideas. One thing about Gold is that he backs up everyting he says with sufficent evidence to convince most skeptics ( except the ones with a lot to lose).<br /><br />If Gold's ideas are true then thousands of textbooks will have to scrapped and re-written - which of course explains the widespread resistance by the scientific community to this idea.<br /><br />The principles of science are supposed to be observe, theorize, test and predict. If your theory is true then it can make a valid prediction. After reading the book I am convinced that Gold is right.<br /><br />After reading a few of the references I also discovered that the conventional theory of oil and gas creation has no real evidence to back it up. The conventional theory fails in between the  testing and predicting phases. As Gold points out, so far no one has ever been able to come up with the chemical reactions needed to form petroleum from decaying organic matter.  I found this book fascinating and well written even for the non-technical person. The issues are well presented and backup up with meticulous notes and backup data.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, and I am sure this page will accumlate several \\"reviews\\" from people who have never read it challenging the data, but I suggest that you make up your own mind. You will find Gold to be very convincing.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Update<br /><br />It appears as if the Russians are making monkeys out of us westerners. They noow have over 300 ultra deep oil wells producing oil from as far down as 40,000 feet. Way beyond any possibility of finding sludge from dead dinosaurs and old rotting cabbage patches.

The idea that a radical terrorist who believes that humans are a blight on the Earth could somehow obtain a bioweapon like Cobra is dripping with believability. There ARE people like that in the world. There are undoubtedly bioweapons not dissimilar to Cobra. For all we know this could already have happened, or may happen tomorrow or be happening as we read this. I read the book over a weekend, I had a very difficult time putting it down. When I did put it down, it was to reflect upon events in the book and wonder. I have always believed that the best fiction is fiction that is based on the truth and real events. I just wonder how long it will be before Prestons story will be considered &quot;prophetic&quot;.  Like the FBI guy said in the book, &quot;you will see this during your career&quot;. My guess is sooner or later, it will happen much like Preston describes. I can only hope that there are people like Alice Austin and Will Hopkins to bail us out. Excellent read.

I guess this is a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; book. I myself loved it. The most frequent criticism of this work seems to be the gory nature of some of the descriptions. Well folks, like it or not, Ebola is a gory disease. This my friends is reality.  I guess our opinions of this book are based on our expectations. I think many people who expected a sterile academic tome of the pathology of Ebola or it means of transmission, received instead, a graphical, realistic description of what Ebola is and what Ebola does. This IS Ebola. If you want to understand Ebola from a human standpoint, this is the book to do it. Other works on this subject can induce narcolepsy, The Hot Zone induces insomnia.  This is the real thing folk, no whitewash, no incomprehensible 14 syllable medical terms. Just real people, and a very real, deady and deeply frightening disease. The author did an exceptional job of bringing an understanding of the very real threat of Ebola to all of us.	1998-02-01

I read &quot;~Titanic&quot; in a single sitting (I think with one or two bathroom breaks) from that point I was hooked.  Each novel got better, more bombastic, Pitt became more invinceable, the women sexier. I think this book proves that sometimes too much of a good thing is just too much. It was good, and I loved every word, but compared to &quot;Titanic&quot; or &quot;Inca Gold&quot; or &quot;Treasure&quot;, this one was just too much. There were few surprises here but tons of action. It is formulaic but what the hell, this is Dirk Pitt! We love the formula!	1998-01-30

If a book does not captivate me in the first 25 pages I rarely bother. For some reason I hung on to this one forced myself past the beginning and I am glad I  did. Compton did an acceptable job overall, but to me it was tad bit too predictable. I think Compton was inspired by Frederick Forsyth, but Forsyth makes for a more interesting read with a much simpler plot. The Acolyte's plot is a bit overdone and this would have been a better book had he kept it simpler and developed the conflicts better. I never really &quot;felt&quot; Greers danger and fear, they all happened too fast and resolved way too easily. I recommend this book, and feel that Compton will improve with practice. To D.C.: re-read some more Forsyth books.	1998-01-30

Much of the technology Levin described is plausable especially today, but that is only &quot;window dressing&quot; for the real story, and the message is more relevant today than when Levin wrote it.
