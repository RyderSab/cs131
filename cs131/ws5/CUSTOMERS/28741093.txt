Lt. Lee Grafton is a police officer from the Special Operations and the Anti-Crime Unit.  Carol is shot one night during a failed drug bust by an officer--Lee knows that it could only have been his partner or himself who shot her.  They are returning fire in the line of duty.  Though the shooting is by the book, this doesn't change the fact that Carol, who is entirely blameless, nearly lost her life in the process.  Carol and Lee manage to start a relationship from the basis of their problematic connection.  The question is will Carol and Lee be able to sustain the considerable outside pressures that make their possibility of success in a relationship against the odds?<br /><br />Though CLOSE ENCOUNTERS relies more on character development, the idea of the shooting and the bad cop angle rather than upon a developed plot--we don't know what the main characters want, what keeps them from getting it, (Well, maybe Lee wants to be a good father and his job is in the way, but this seems secondary), what they do to try to achieve it, etc.--it's a very interesting read that draws you in from the start.<br /><br />What doesn't make any sense is Carol's change-of-heart.  The decision is made abruptly and then never logically rationalized.  Personally, I don't see how Carol could claim to love Lee and sue the city--given that it will likely ruin a career that is the only one that he has ever seen himself doing, the career that gave him self-respect and taught him how to be a leader.  And I don't see how he could claim to love Carol and not feel betrayed.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Carol is talking about not wanting to be a victim and how filing a suit against the city would make her feel like she had taken that role; she talks about how her life is more important than money; she says that she thinks that she was shot for a reason--that it was a blessing in disguise.  Carol can't imagine any other way that Lee might have entered her life:<br /><br />\\"She'd almost been killed.  She had survived, but everything had changed.  Forever....  Her father had suggested that God had other plans for her.  But during the past few days Carol had begun thinking that maybe she had been given a second chance to make some plans of her own.\\"  (69 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<br /><br />Carol says to Lee of the incident:  \\"...I think what I went through might have been a blessing in disguise.\\"  (123 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<br /><br />Sandra Kitt writes:  \\"Though [Carol] appreciated that her brother was acting in her best interests, she felt a great reluctance to do anything that might betray Lee's personal confession to her.  She had no doubt that he had acted entirely on his own in telling her his role [that would be accidentally shooting her].  She had no intention of using it against him, and she didn't want anyone else to do so either....\\"  (134 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<br /><br />When her ex-husband points out that a law suit could make the city take accountability, saying:  \\"You could always make them tell the truth....You know what they say about the truth.  It can set you free....  []The fact that it was a black woman who was shot adds fuel to the fire,\\" Carol wants nothing to do with an \\"all-out protest\\".  (159, 160 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<br /><br />And later when her brother tries yet again to convince her to sue, she refuses:  \\"...I'm alive....  [H]e apologized....  []The way I see it, I got a huge second chance that morning.  Doesn't he deserve one too?  []I'm telling you this because I want you to understand why I don't want to sue.\\"  (178 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<br /><br />And as Carol and Lee take the ultimate plunge into a sexual relationship, Kitt writes:  \\"The time to be frightened or to set boundaries had been the morning they'd met.  The time to be angry was in the distant past.  Blameand recrimination were beside the point.  What really mattered was this moment.  Right now might be all they'd ever have.\\"  (235 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).  So, my question is:  what reason is left to sue and potentially destroy her lover's career?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, as a victim of violent crime myself, I think these kinds of decisions are very personal and should be respected.  But the character of Carol has been written so inconsistently.  Dogmatically, she refused to sue and rebelled against any encouragement to do so.  And then there is a quick flip-flop (right after Lee's ex-lover walks in on Carol and Lee and spews her petty venom) with next to no explanation for Carol's abrupt change in prerogative.  It just didn't ring true.  Neither did Lee's reaction.  Nor did Carol's continued professions of love.  The least amount of damage I could believe that would have been done with Carol making this decision--she did not even warn Lee that she intended to sue--would have been awkwardness and distance.  The most amount of damage I could envision is the destruction of their fledgling relationship and either coldness or angry resentment being all that was left between them.  The cozy, sweet climax Kitt set out didn't ring true at all.  I give it 3 ¼ stars.<br /><br />It Was Almost Pretty Good, But It Turned Out Only Pretty Okay.moment.

US	28741093	R2IDX47PJB103W	0380803291	621411175	A Rogue in Texas (Rogues in Texas)	Books	3	19	23	N	Y	Another Time, Another Place...?	* Spoiler Alert* The central characters, Abbie Westland (`Abbie') and son of the duke, Grayson Rhodes (`Gray') want different things:  Abbie wants to be self-sufficient and to be able to take care of her kids.  Gray wants to be able to hold his head up, to earn respect and love.  Abbie needs help to keep her cotton farm going, and Gray needs to escape England, the stigma of being labeled a \\"bastard\\" and end his life of debauchery.  So, Abbie pays a man 300 dollars to hire workers from England to work her land, and furnishes the means of Gray's unwitting escape.<br /><br />Abbie and Gray find themselves feeling things for each other that they would never have expected.  The fulfill each other in ways they could not have imagined.  And just when they think they have the love of their dreams within their grasp, their hopes are cruelly deflated by the unexpected.  The question is, have they come so close to happiness for nothing?<br /><br />And this brings us to the part that made me give A ROGUE IN TEXAS a rather low rating.  ....  Somehow, Abbie turns around and gives us the most unbelievable version of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY (Clint Eastwood & Meryl Streep or Robert James Waller)--wife giving up true love, because she's been committed by vows--that I've ever had the displeasure of reading.<br /><br />Author, Lorraine Heath, writes the following about Abbie's husband, John Westland (who is presumed dead):  \\"The farm had always come first with John....  He had fed her body, but never her heart [though he certainly had `nudged up' her nightgown and rolled over on her, expressing his present `need'], never her soul....\\"  (A ROGUE IN TEXAS).  According to Abbie, it was her husband's behavior that had made her fear men's touch--he was never satisfied with her, he never expressing gratitude for her work, and he took from her sexually, as if her body were a vessel, as if it were owed to him.  The man didn't even recognize her when he got back from the war--he was the one who had become gaunt and been changed so drastically--and when he did, the first thing he talked about was their farm.  Oh, and the next words out of his mouth were:  \\"See about getting supper on the table, woman.\\"  And yet, Heath expects us to believe that Abbie would turn around and welcome the man in any way other than `dutifully'?<br /><br />Abbie is glad he is back--??--on what planet and for what reason?  She certainly doesn't need him to put food in her belly anymore.  By Abbie's own admission, Gray--a stranger-had given her beloved children \\"more attention than their own father ever had.\\" Abbie's supposed to be a woman of simple desires, not a simpleton.  However, I can find no other excuse for such a poorly-explained and inconsistent change-of-heart on Abbie's behalf.  Or maybe, I just have to accept that this story takes place in another time, and women back then would have been DE-lighted to have a man like John back.  Maybe, but I don't think so.<br /><br />John's resurrection was a twist in the story that I could see coming, and yet hoped wouldn't.  It kind of reminds me of the movie SOMMERSBY (with Richard Gere and Jodi Foster), but that was just so much more believable and developed:  the entire movie was spent with the husband who hadn't been so lovable trying his darndest to make his wife be with him for more than duty--for love.  In A ROGUE IN TEXAS, all this estranged husband had to do was take his estranged son fishing, and he was golden:  \\"You were a good husband, John Westland, a good man.\\"  Abbie tearfully claims to LOVE the man who thought her name was `woman'--\\"not as powerful a love as [he] probably deserved, but love all the same.\\"  Search me.<br /><br />And finding closure with the story--one of the most difficult thing for many, many writers to do--was a little clumsy and corny.  Often an otherwise good story is ruined by an ending that doesn't match.  Usually, I've found that it's too light-hearted for the rest of the book and its characters.  Or it happens too quickly and is abrupt.  But then, it is hard to wrap up a story and give readers the happy ending they're usually looking for....<br /><br />The other cast of characters--Harry, Kit, Jessye, etc., were either in the book to much or too little:  I say, either give them a story and develop them, so I care about what they're saying and want to know what happens to them, or keep them out, so they don't irritate me and slow the story down.<br /><br />Overall, A ROGUE IN TEXAS was pretty okay.  Heath obviously has talent.  It had some great, sentimental lines and was based on a good idea.  The character of Gray was a little too forgiving and the character of Abbie was a little too devoted to John; I could understand her choosing to stay with him, but falling in-love too?  Farfetched, if you ask me.  3 ¼ stars.<br /><br />Willing To Give It Another Go With Lorraine Heath.is abrupt.

If THE MORE I SEE YOU is anything to go by, then Kurland is the mistress of stretching out an idea for page after page until there are nearly 400 of them...without ever developing the characters or a real story.<br /><br />The main character, Jessica Blakely wants a real, romantic relationship.  When her blind date trip to England with a slobbering, self-centered philosophy professor doesn't do the trick, Jessica decides to wish upon a star, looking for love:  \\"All right, since we're here in England, I'll have a fair and gallant knight.... [O]ne with lots of chivalry.  And I'd like one with a steady job, an even temper, and a house with room enough for a concert grand piano.  I'd like this man to love me at least as much as he loves himself.\\"  (THE MORE I SEE YOU).<br /><br />As it turns out, the real obstacle to Jessica getting what she wants is the fact that the man of her dreams has been dead for centuries--that is, hero, Richard De Galtres (or Richard of Burwyck-on-the-Sea) lived in the Year of Our Lord 1260...while Jessica hails from 1999.  But her wish lands her in the thirteenth century where she becomes the target of Richard's mad brother, Hugh who fancies her a 'faery.'<br /><br />Ultimately, as Jessica and Richard grow closer, Jessica's life is put in danger.  The question for the reader is will love be enough.<br /><br />It's the opinion of this reviewer that Kurland (like so many other authors who try to spin a plot out of the idea of a person from the future being thrown into the past) relies far too heavily upon this gimmick.  And as another reviewer quite aptly noted, the time travel aspect is quite unscientific and unrealistic.  If this is part of what is drawing your interest, then THE MORE I SEE YOU will definitely not satisfy on that score.<br /><br />Additionally, as far as character development goes...it was hard to even imagine what Jessica looks like.  And as to a plot (which is more than an interesting idea, a theme, topic, interesting person or setting--all of which must be be brought from latency to fulfillment in order to be declared an artfully rendered plot)...proper development of anything that would help the reader to sustain his or her disbelief--that is, any thought to realism--is relegated to a far too low position of priority.<br /><br />One of the very few things we know about Jessica--she has a mother in contemporary times, she's a composer...oh, and that she JUST SO HAPPENS to have great ability with designing and building thirteenth century castles from stone--is from left field and incredible.  The fact that she's a composer is rarely mentioned.  But wouldn't you think that her strengths in this area would have been appropriate for a woman of those times and interesting to her new counterparts?  Well, the architecture angle again seemed a little too convenient.<br /><br />Finally, though Richard is more well drawn, beyond his torturous childhood, he needs more fleshing out.<br /><br />THE MORE I SEE YOU is a great title and the notion of it--which I suppose is that the more you see of someone, the more fondess you feel for them--could have been charming.

Others kind of drift into it, a little at a time.  And sometimes they're pushed.\\" (THE TOUCH OF FIRE).  Do the reasons matter?<br /><br />When hero/anti-hero, Rafferty McCay (\\"Rafe\\") met Doctor Annis Theodora Parker (\\"Annie\\") he was already a different man than he ever would have imagined growing up a young Southern gentleman.  Howard writes, \\"He'd been twenty-four, and just beginning to think of the security and closeness of marriage, when the war had started.  The following four years of guerrilla fighting with Mosby had hardened him []\\".  Fate would have it that meeting Rafe would begin a process of change that would shape Annie into a far different woman than she ever had been before.  Considered an old maid, she would have a chance to experience passion.  Committed to saving life, Annie would find herself in the position to end one...all for a love she had never believed she would have, want or need.<br /><br />According to Rafe, very powerful people have framed him in order to keep a secret buried.  Their reprehensible scheme has robbed him of his freedom and identity.  The bad things he has done, the crimes he has committed were all in self-defense, he claims.  And he has no choice but to drag the good doctor, Annie into the mess when he finds himself knocking at death's door.  The question is whether he and Annie can find a satisfying resolution-give Rafe and Annie their lives back.<br /><br />As I see it, there are a couple of big problems:<br /><br />First, Rafe becomes unbelievably mushy over the course of THE TOUCH OF FIRE.  His behavior in the later half of the book is very inconsistent with what he portrayed in the beginning:  a man whose memories of what it means to be sensitive and caring have burned to bitter dust.  It's got to be hard to ease a tough-as-nails hero into a sensitive lover through the course of a novel, and in THE TOUCH OF FIRE it definitely showed.  There seem to be two heroes-Rafe I and Rafe II.<br /><br />THE TOUCH OF FIRE kind of goes down the corny and incredible road to disaster when, after not one but three bounty hunters have proved how far they are willing to go to acquire the 10,000 dollar bounty on our heroes head, Rafe is convinced by doe-eyed innocent, Doc Annie to stop for a week to administer aid to an ailing Apache camp.  Declared enemies of the white man are dying of black measles and Rafe and Annie put their lives at risk in what is an essentially impossible task.  This interlude is out-of-character for Rafe and nauseating on the part of Annie.<br /><br />And for a sadly over-the-top finish:  (1) There is an odd suggestion Howard wants us to swallow and that Rafe incongruously pitches-Annie is a white medicine woman who can heal through touch (an odd twist that tastes awfully gimmicky, not to mention awkward to this reviewer); and (2) Badass marshal Atwater shows up to conclude his final job as marshal, but after hearing Rafe's conspiracy theory Atwater (previously reputed to be this tougher-than-tough lawman) decides that he will oblige the lovers in a detour away from his hard-earned money in favor of helping them prove Rafe's innocence by taking a trip to New Orleans.  Marshal Atwater is a humorsome guy (whom I imagine looks something like Clint Eastwood), but he's no tougher than a marshmallow.  It just took something away from the book that Howard had everyone go SO soft at the end.<br /><br />Okay, okay, okay, so Ms. Howard got a little crazy toward the end.  Overall, the book is very exciting, sexy and interesting.  I give THE TOUCH OF FIRE 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Pretty Good.t definitely showed.

At sixteen, Santine began working at the construction company that would be the first company he would own-and all by the age of twenty three!  And so, when game warden and curator of a wild-animal reserve near Sandiego, Janna Cannon makes her fateful entr&eacute;e into his life, while he may have developed into a `legend[ary]' and `self-made billionaire wielding more power than many heads of state', Santine is noticeably less developed in the emotional department; The male lead of THE LADY AND THE UNICORN often acts the part of a spoiled and petulant child-thinking everything should be his way all the time.  A supreme narcissist, readers will agree that is about time Santine had a reason to think about someone other than himself.  Janna is supposed to be that reason.<br /><br />Johansen wants the reader to accept that Janna's need to save some of the endangered species and other wild animals would make her willing to accept an indecent proposal from a giant of a man with harsh, rugged features, who cool as a cucumber proclaims that he'd like to keep her as a pet:  \\"I said that I'd never had a pet.  Well I've decided to acquire one for the next month or so.  My own wild thing to keep me amused until I can return to San Franci[s]co.\\"  A bargain is struck-a grant of Santine's land in return for Janna's cooperation.  And so, using this rather unbelievable and yet interesting device, Johansen's contrivance keeps the leads together and a romance...of sorts...is set to unravel.<br /><br />The story is really a play on Beauty and the Beast to this reviewer's mind.  The 1983 setting allows for a hero that is more dominant and cavalier with the heroine's needs than is popularly described today.  Accordingly, the heroine accepts this rough treatment with eternal serenity and grace-also unlikely to see a female lead written this way today.  Also, there are a few uncomfortable moments, such as when Santine declares:  `I've been on the verge of raping you since I looked up and saw you shimmering in the lamplight like a sexy ghost' and his determination to call Janna an `earth mother' in several (maybe all) of the love scenes or `Pocahontas' because of her Native American heritage....  If you can get past the fact that THE LADY AND THE UNICORN is NOT politically correct, then you'll be okay.

When the owners of AdCo Enterprises, Joe Conally and his partner, Reese Addison contract the interior design services of Olivia Jones for their most recent project, everyone finds themselves in above their heads.<br /><br />First, the Victorian summer cottage that is to be renovated, Mallenegua is located on Mallen island.  Ginna Gray writes:  \\"Though there were those who claimed that Savannah was the most haunted city in the United States, and locals were proud of their ghosts, that didn't hold true for Mallenegua.\\"  So, not only is the place reputed to be haunted, but the history of its owners is enough to make anyone nervous.  Apparently, just after the Civil War, Theobald Mallen showed up in Savannah and tried to outdo the Vanderbilt's estate, Biltmore by building Mallenegua.  It was also an open secret that Mallen's business was anything but legitimate:  \\"At the time, the citizens of Savannah believed, and the old guard still swore that it was true, that Mallen Shipping Lines had merely been a cover for Theobald's true business--smuggling pirated and illegal goods into the country, and that he wasn't particular about what they were.\\"<br /><br />And that brings us to the ship shod mystery/thriller aspect of PALE MOON RISING.  The story is this:  Theobald Mallen's step-great-great-grandson is trying to carry on the family business.  Only this time, the smuggled goods of choice are heroine and cocaine (it would have been nice if the effects of this smuggling had been discussed with respect to its effect on the town, even peripherally, so that the reader could accept this story as not being completely from left field).  When this distant Mallen relative finds that the rightful owner of Mallenegua has sold the place, leaving him without a place to store his latest shipment, he does what anyone would do--dress up in early 19th Century costumes (just like old Theo did) and pretends to be a ghost.  This is right out of Scooby Doo!  This storyline does not hold up or maintain the reader's interest with the scattering of threatening notes and 'ghost sightings,' which Gray seems to have thrown in as a gimmick.<br /><br />Second, Olivia Jones used to be Olivia Conally.  Yup, you guessed it:  she is Joe Conally's ex-wife.  In the deep South, they have their own caste society and many years ago, when Joe was at the top and Olivia was clearly at the bottom the fates conspired to bring them together.  Then Joe's mother conspired to pull them apart.  The Mallenegua project brings these star-crossed lovers together again, but for my taste, there isn't much loving to be had.  Too much time is spent rehashing Mother Conally's problem with their relationship and the presently non-existent class gap.  It's not like Olivia is scrubbing floors or something, but you could never tell the way this book gets going bemoaning their incredible differences.<br /><br />And finally, even though Gray's description of furniture and rooms show either a clear interest in or detailed research of antiques/period pieces (maybe both), it can get a little tedious.  I think she should have focused more on clearing up issues between Olivia and Joe, so that they could have more romance and happiness and forward progress in this book.

They are still tormenting the Shielders, but they have extended their galactic wrath to another unlikely race, the Leors.  \\"Up until now,\\" Spangler writes, \\"they had given the Leors a wide berth.  Like the Shielders, the Leors were immune to the psionic brain waves the Controllers used to dominate the majority of the cultures in their quadrant.\\"<br /><br />There is a striking resemblance between the heroine of THE SHIELDER and the female lead of SHADOW FIRES, Jenna dan Aaron.  When the Leor leader demands a bride in return for Leor assistance in transporting \\"two newly uncovered Shielder settlements from the grasp of the Controllers[]\\", Jenna (another outcast like Leoness dan Ranul) compromises her freedom for her thankless people.  Likewise, upon not-so-careful examination, there is much that the Shielder and Leor culture share in common.  Shielders can sense each other.  Leors can see auras.  Both cultures have cold-hearted laws that they adhere to mercilessly, and yet only the Leors are thought to be barbarians.  Search me.<br /><br />The best thing about SHADOW FIRES is the introduction of the serpentine hero, Arion.  I wouldn't have believed that anyone could make a part-man/part-reptile sexy!  He is incredibly strong, dominant, disciplined and brave.  The Leors are such an interesting race and Spangler's creativity and imagination really shows in this book because of them.<br /><br />There were at least three big problems with SHADOW FIRES:<br /><br />First, there is no small amount of time spent chasing down the storyline of why the Controllers are attacking the Leor--that would be, because they want to control the galaxy and everything in it--and how they are attacking the Leor--that would be, with the help of one or more Leor traitors-and why anyone would break the laws through such treachery--that would be, because of greed and discontent.  It seems to this reviewer like Spangler is taking readers on a circular adventure, where the destination is where they began.  That is, this angle is not complicated, just over-talked, so that the reader will think there is more to it than it appears at first blush.<br /><br />Second, Jenna dan Aaron's seemingly endless fear of Arion, Comdar of Saura was very irritating, because it continued past the time that was reasonable and believable.  Additionally, Jenna's fears could have been put to rest very early on if one of her innumerable questions had addressed the very things that were bothering her most-did Arion cut the slaves' vocal chords--?--why did he kill animals and bring them to the goddess (although, it is hard for me to believe that Jenna had never heard of a blood sacrifice acting as a tribute to the gods)?  Moreover, Jenna's repulsion regarding some of Arion's decisions as Comdar made her a complete hypocrite.  When Arion followed Leor law and sentenced a man to death for an accidental killing, Jenna found the laws and Arion both \\"barbaric\\".  And yet, \\"Shielders had put people to death--innocent people, whose only crime was that they were too sick or too old to work.\\"  Hmmm....<br /><br />And finally, though the ending was a bit better in SHADOW FIRES than in SHIELDERS (see my review), I declare that Spangler has a problem with resolving her books in a way that is not abrupt, incredible or bad for my blood sugar.<br /><br />Don't Expect Too Much, Or You Might Get Burned.scontent.

Juliet is a poor little rich girl that's just dying to love and be loved.  Beauregard Butler Dupree is more than a sexy good ole boy cop.  Beau is big-brother-substitute-father for three sisters, Camilla, Anabel and one very spirited Josie Lee.  Beau's acting captain, `Pissant' Pheffer, a tyrant with a chip on his shoulder gets Beau taken off the case that could lead him to the criminal who victimized none other than his baby sister, Josie Lee.  When Beau is reassigned to a job acting as Juliet's bodyguard, a job Beau views as no more than a farce--`babysitting,' he calls it-BE MY BABY gets off and running.<br /><br />The problem with BE MY BABY is one that seems to be common in contemporary romance--that is, the romance, the love is M.I.A.  More than any other book I've read recently, the loving and affectionate part of the relationship between Juliet and Beau in BE MY BABY was underdeveloped.<br /><br />\\"I have always come in a poor third with the people whose affection I most craved...,\\" Juliet says at one point, but she needn't have:  it's clear that Juliet is love-starved from the way she accepts Beau's poor behavior.  Now, don't get me wrong, our Beau seems to be very sexy and experienced.  But he is also not very considerate or sensitive to any woman's emotions and needs except for those of his sisters.  His handling of Juliet is clumsy (the bull in  a china shop is brought to mind) as she opens herself to him.  She is a fragile woman inside, one who's had her heart trampled many times by those she tried to love.  But Beau doesn't sense...anything from Juliet.  He doesn't honestly see how special she is.<br /><br />Oh, yes, he goes on an on about her porn star mouth and gorgeous feet.  However, though he sees her kindness and sweetness with others, her graciousness always seems to come as a surprise to him.  Beau unburdens himself sexually and emotionally with Juliet, and yet I can't recall him once asking about Juliet's life, her family, her problems.<br /><br />Clearly, the `love' scenes in the book are scorching.  And that's what seems to be the glue between the two leads.  Beau has been suffering from something close to a self-imposed abstinence for around ten years, and then--presto--he has a convenient woman whom he must be around 24/7.  She isn't exactly his type, he protests.  But she'll do.  And for Juliet's part, she seemed to be invigorated by the dominant edge (or one might call it thoughtlessness, carelessness, self-centeredness) in Beau.  She seemed to like being `dragged' about like his modern day cave woman.  And to top that, having you-know-what with Beau was better than she'd had with anyone else.  To be crude, I think Juliet was `sprung,' `whipped,' whatever you want to call it.

Ho, we do not count such trifles as miracles in the master's service!'\\"  says one Joshua Dimmock of the end of the adventure that is Georgette Heyer's BEAUVALLET.  The `master' is Sir Nicholas Beauvallet, English noble and pirate, a personage whose feats have built him up to truly mythic proportions in the eyes of both friend and foe.  The `miracle' is `Mad Beauvallet's' most recent exploit--that is, stealing away a noble daughter of England's sworn enemy Spain, Dona Dominica de Rada y Sylva, not by any circuitous route, but by coming right to her home in Madrid.<br /><br />Even though she herself has declared him to be the \\"enemy of all Spaniards,\\" from the moment that Dominica sets eyes on the dashing Beauvallet, she begins to become infected with his `madness'.  And says he:  \\"But I have it in mind, sweetheart, to make an Englishwoman of you\\".  And so begins this wonderful tale of a man who either has nine lives or just believes he does and in the believing makes it so.<br /><br />BEAUVALLET is full of twists and turns, witty repartee (sharp writing, so much so that you will want to dog-ear the pages and highlight the best lines), vivid characters and a hero like no other!  I have to say that you'll find that a solid slang dictionary really comes in handy.<br /><br />And while Heyer may be more well-known for her work in the Regency Romance genre, BEAUVALLET isn't Regency, but Elizabethan.<br /><br />Heyer's great with period detail and accuracy, so if you don't know the period vocabulary very well (and maybe a little Spanish and French as well) then you will find that there is a learning curve to get over before the story can really just sink in and carry you away.  But carry you away it will!<br /><br />A True Romance.	2005-07-25

[He] wasn't interested in the old ways, [] didn't want the power.  [Michael] wanted to live a human life.\\"  One of the biggest problems with THE SECRET OF THE WOLF is that other than this, the reader never gets a very clear picture of Michael St. Clare.  Rebecca Flanders fails to develop the hero so that neither by aesthetic description nor style or behavior is the character of Michael made understandable, knowable.<br /><br />The second book in this series, WOLF IN WAITING, the story of the Werewolf chosen to take Michael's place, Noel Duprey, paints such a vivid picture of Flanders' take on Werewolves and their supernatural culture, that it is easier to understand why Michael might feel as he does, but then it would take hindsight to understand Michael's predicament.  Accordingly, THE SECRET OF THE WOLF cannot stand alone.  Standing alone, THE SECRET OF THE WOLF paints a one-dimensional picture of Werewolves, making the fictional race seem very cold and monstrous.  The reader is left feeling that the side of Michael that is a Werewolf is indeed shameful and his old life and culture something that any one of us would shed without a second thought.<br /><br />Columnist, Aggie McDonald, who accidentally hits Michael with her car one dark night--this, along with emotional trauma he has already endured, helps along the reluctant heir's amnesia--seems to credit the man that she takes in like a stray cat for not being quite as dangerous and seemingly mentally disturbed as the average indigent John Doe might be.  And she decides that because he never actually hurt her--though he puts his hand through a plate glass door, turns the handle and walks into her room and wakens her to his sleepwalking self covered in blood--he is THE ONE:  \\"And watching him, she knew the answer to the question she had been afraid to ask herself these past weeks.  Why she had disregarded all common sense and welcomed him into her home.  Why she trusted him when all evidence indicated she do exactly the opposite.  Why she couldn't be afraid of him, no matter how often she was tempted to.  It was really very simple...,\\" Aggie thinks as she makes the realization.  Hmm....  Really?  I wish someone would explain it to me.  So, although the romantic relationship between the leads doesn't exactly ring true, it somehow manages to be sweet and the love scenes steamy.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is another pretty okay book, that would be just alright if it was forced to stand alone.  However, I do suggest reading the entire series.  Then you will be able to contextualize and visualize Michael, I assure you.

Although WOLF IN WAITING features supernatural characters, it is really just a story about finding out that what really matters in life is never material, but always spiritual.  It is a story that will strike a chord with most readers even though the main characters, werewolves, fancy themselves `better' than humans.  Unexpectedly, thinking of the characters as something other than human-though, in reality, these characters act and think like our most vain and conceited humans-allows the reader to take a fresh look at humanity, at our values and priorities, our prejudices and judgments.<br /><br />Like most people, the main characters, Victoria St. Clare and Noel Duprey, heir designe to the Werewolf Empire are scared of spirituality and do not try to understand it.  They think of duties instead:  to the pack, to their leader.  Because Victoria and Noel find so much of their concern focused without, they lose some of the most important aspects of themselves-their sense of adventure, sense of humor and most important, their abilities to recognize the signs of love.<br /><br />The story goes something like this:  Victoria, a junior executive with perfumery, Clare de Lune, finds herself acting more like junior investigator when Noel, heir to the Werewolf Empire (and the man she has loved hopelessly since she was a girl) shows up at her cubicle.  Noel tells her that someone has been selling trade secrets, and that she is his number one suspect.<br /><br />The story is carried along by the search for the unspeakable-a werewolf traitor-and a resolution to the passable mystery.  The mystery seems thin and obvious but is resolved in a way which, in hindsight is really quite clever.  Rebecca Flanders does a pretty okay job maintaining the tension and suspense (this is no suspense/mystery/thriller by any means), a better job making a seamless connection between this book and the first in the series that doesn't feel too forced, and a great job capturing the essence of intimacy and passionate obsession.

CRIMSON MOON is about a werewolf who finally meets his match...wait, I mean his 'mate' in a woman with some supernatural abilities of her own.  He's a criminal, but a good one--Werewolf Robin Hood, if you will.  And her father is a target because of her father's indifference to the harmful effects of his business policies on the evironment (wholly unbelivable).  He wants to make her father pay; he also wants his daughter for a wife.  HE is Johnny Marshall also known as Sam Morgan.  SHE is Olivia Woodlock.<br /><br />Together with this story is a subplot regarding a crazy business competitor of Olivia's father.  Apparently, this very disturbed villain has hatched a scheme to replace Olivia with another woman-whom he has kidnapped, molested and surgically altered against her will (to look like Olivia, of course).  Olivia spurned him, and he wants her all the more.<br /><br />The story is thin and undeveloped, as are:  the romance, the lead characters, the villain.  The villain and environmental protection burglar/hero business are the weakest part of CRIMSON MOON.  Olivia loses her heart to Sam inside of 30 pages:  \\"...she couldn't shake the disturbing feeling that he had taken some part of her with him [I think she means her heart]...,\\" though she had met him only moments before and talked with him for a few minutes, showing him some of her father's art collection.  Okaaaaay....  CRIMSON MOON is convoluted and suffers from a lack of depth of intellect or emotion.  If you are into excessive, inessential sex scenes then this flat, tall tale of a story from Rebecca York also known as Ruth Glick will be just the thing.<br /><br />And if I haven't been clear enough, I have another way of putting it:  I started reading this book two months ago and only got about halfway through.  Last night I tried again (I like to finish books I've paid for...if I can), but I only made it about 10 pages further.

Lady Sara Jane Illingsworth, also known as one Jane Inglesby is a daughter of an earl, a lady from the country.  When treachery erupts, threatening the lady's birthright, Jane is forced to flee to London in search of her godmother, Lady Harriet Wells.  However, Jane finds that because her godmother is indefinitely out of town, Jane will need to find another asylum.  On the run and unsure whom she can trust, Jane falls back on the anonymity of blending in as best she can as a member of the working class.<br /><br />And as Jane finds her interim solution threatened by a bullying mistress at a milliner's shop, Jane stumbles across an opportunity to work as a nurse...for a duke, Jocelyn Dudley, Duke of Tresham (\\"Tresham\\").  Jane unintentionally plays a part in a serious injury to Tresham, and a connection is born between the two of passionate anger.  However, Jane eventually enters into a business arrangement that may put her heart into the hands of one very pampered, very arrogant and very ruthless Tresham.<br /><br />Mary Balogh understands the psychology of characters and pays it heed.  In MORE THAN A MISTRESS, insightful and unusually sensitive descriptions unearth some of the most salient visions of vulnerability, anger, loss and shame...and will make your heart pound.  Balogh is accomplished not only with character development but also with tackling hard topics realistically.<br /><br />Additionally, Balogh manages to evoke steam without being vulgar.  Not only are the love scenes and relationship emotionally poignant, they are well-suited to the manners and mores of Regency England.<br /><br />As one of the preeminent writers of Regency Romances, it must be noted that Balogh has a unique style, which does not quite capture the light-hearted style and wit of one of the finest writers in the genre, Georgette Heyer; but Balogh does rival Heyer's empathetic portrayals. While Heyer is a master at comedic fiction and character development, Balogh captures the feeling of her characters very well, and her loving attention to detail renders her characters quite 3-dimensional and appealing.<br /><br />And while, MORE THAN A MISTRESS was nearly perfect, I am giving the book 4 and ¾ stars due to  its only shortcoming-the drawn-out final chapters and the relative decline of coherence and significance viewed in disappointing contrast with the previous chapters added to the anticlimax of the ending.<br /><br />Here's Hoping My First Balogh Is Not A Fluke.d her loving attention to detail renders her characters quite 3-dimensional and appealing.

A seeming installment from one of Suzanne Brockmann's naval series, or at least a revisiting of familiar characters from certain books-including FOREVER BLUE; PRINCE JOE; and HARVARD'S EDUCATION??-FRISCO'S KID is about a man who loses himself when he loses the only thing that he feels has ever defined him-that is, his career as an active Navy SEAL, when he suffers a debilitating knee injury.  With the loss of his title, it is the opinion of Lieutenant Allen Francisco that he has also lost his right to respect, his identity and his right to be called a man.  Lt. \\"Frisco\\" begins to hope that maybe he can be more than Frisco-the-Navy-SEAL after he meets his polar opposite in the exquisite body of teacher, Mia Summerton.  Behind her exotic beauty is a strong, sexy woman who is ready to disagree with him on everything from government spending to gun control.  Frisco wonders if it is too much to hope that she is a woman who is also willing to love a Navy Seal who has learned that he will never be that same Navy Seal he once was.<br /><br />Allen Francisco is just the kind of man any woman would want...to fix.  Frisco has had enough bad luck and heartbreak to make the most independent woman's nurturing and protective instincts go into overdrive:  he is the product of a broken home, a drunken father.  He is the person in his family expected to take on the burdens of others without complaining.  And in spite of the fact that he is well-loved by his friends, as an adult as he did when he was a child, Frisco believes that the only way he will ever `matter,' is if other people think he mattes.  To Frisco, the only reason why people would ever think Allen Francisco mattered is because he is a Navy SEAL.<br /><br />Psychologically, after Frisco injured himself, he fell into a dark hole of self-pity, shame and frustration that manifested itself in bouts of rage and drinking.  His tender moments-when he was `fathering' his niece or when he felt particularly dejected-made ME want to take care of him, to hold him, etc.  As Mia thought to herself many times, Frisco was never really in a place to be `ready' for love.  He needed and wanted comfort, physical and otherwise.  And it seems that Mia gave that to him.  I could understand, as a woman and as someone with a big heart, falling under the spell of Frisco's tragic appeal mixed in with his aesthetic beauty.  But I couldn't see someone in Frisco's stage of grief and loss (over his abilities and his career) REALLY falling in-love.<br /><br />This book is great, if you're not picky about delving into the psychological reasons that your lead characters are together.

Putting aside the Scooby Doo-ish ending and the general surrealism of the plot--an out-of-work buyer for a department store becomes a bounty-hunter--the first novel in the Stephanie Plum Series, ONE FOR THE MONEY, is not only hilarious, but somehow manages to keep the reader in a such a sound state of suspended disbelief that he or she is likely to find him or herself thinking, `hey, maybe that's what I oughta do; the life sounds exciting and the pay's not bad...'.  And Janet Evanovich is so skilled at layering her very colorful and likeable characters, of which `the burg,' Stephanie Plum's neighborhood in New Jersey, is just one.  Forgetting the outlandish premise of Stephanie Plum's adventures--that an everyday average woman can just up and become a bounty hunter and make her livelihood capturing everything from DUI offenders to murderers and meanwhile rub elbows with rapists and hookers with ease-ONE FOR THE MONEY will take you on a thrill ride packed with a great suspense/mystery for a main course and the appealing appetizer of a comedic look into an intriguing slice of the New Jersey cultural pie.  And there is a little tension thrown in for dessert-the steamy amorphous kind that hints at a (or a few) potential romantic relationship(s) further along in the series.<br /><br />In ONE FOR THE MONEY, Stephanie Plum finds that \\"[b]eing a bounty hunter [is] a little more complicated than [she'd] originally assumed []\\" when she finds herself mixed up in a dangerous conspiracy, the likes of which she never could have imagined.  Six months into joblessness, having her car impounded, forced to sell her appliances and tempted to share hamster nuggets with her pet, Rex, Stephanie doesn't find it too hard to be convinced to become a `skip tracer,' someone paid to retrieve individuals who have failed to appear in court after a bond has been posted on their behalf...people who don't want to be found.  $10,000 bucks, her percentage of the bond for her first retrieval doesn't sound bad to Stephanie at all until she finds out two things:  (1) she could get shot or have to shoot someone else in the process; and (2) her first assignment is to take Joseph Morelli into custody.<br /><br />Stephanie Plum has had some interaction with the devilishly handsome and sexy Morelli before on more than one occasion-intimate interaction.  As one person put it, `...half the  women in New Jersey have sold him their cannoli....'!  However, as the reader laughs and cringes his or her way through the story as Stephanie walks through her humiliations, family dinners, seriously close calls, dubious accomplishments and rare triumphs, it becomes clearer that being a tyro in the criminal retrieval industry is the least of the many problems in Stephanie's world.  And it is a rich world that Evanovich has created, a lush breeding ground for humor, lust, danger, mystery, loss, but most importantly, growth-growth of a story, of characters  and of a fine fantasy world brimming with many more tales to tell.

She is a beautiful and talented artist for a Manhattan publisher.  But she is the lost younger sister, suffering from the effects of being too long in the cold shadow of sassy, assertive, creative and driven fashion designer sister, Gail.  Leah is a quietly thoughtful woman, and while she lets her imagination run riot when it comes to her artistic renderings, she longs to bring some of that vibrancy and intensity into her life, especially her love life.  Add to that:  an unreported mugging and near sexual assault resulting in recurring nightmares, a contentious relationship and too-close-for-comfort living arrangement with her acerbic big sister, a little sexual harassment and a general eschewal of her true value at work and Leah is a normal woman with her share of heavy burdens.  A string of ended relationships and the mugging have left Leah feeling unsafe and insecure.  And under that fear is a layer of rage that begins to turn inward in a destructive wave of depression after a devastating secret resolves the question of why her sister is acting EXTRA nasty....<br /><br />THE COLOR OF LOVE is a book about one of the most unfair phenomena in this world:  those who are the most self-concerned and ruthless seem to be the ones who get what they want; they get catered to.  And while those people who use, abuse and manipulate us encourage us to remain confused and constantly searching for an elusive validation, they also resent what kindness they perceive in us.  Several characters in THE COLOR OF LOVE displayed this kind of emotional ruthlessness--a sister, to a nameless attacker, to a street kid, to co-workers and even boyfriends. THE COLOR OF LOVE is also about fear:  some fear can overtake you, if you don't have a center--that is, if your sense of self comes from without; and sometimes there is just a fear of not being good enough.<br /><br />Leah shows true courage when, after all that she has been through, she fights for a love that seems doomed with one of the most unlikely of men; his name is Jason Horne, and he is handsome and tough.  He is White.  And he is a cop.  Even for this reviewer, a Black woman who has a police officer for a father, the shock and dismay described by Leah at this revelation seemed believable and understandable.<br /><br />Actually, everything about this book felt that way-real and compelling.  I felt Leah's fear and doubt and anger like it was my own.  Likewise, Jason's story-which felt like a side story to me-will be as painful, hopeful and as frustrating for the reader as it is for him.  And the love scenes will grip you all the more, because of the fact that they are made integral to the story and not just thrown in to provoke the reader.  That doesn't make them any less electrifying and delightful.  I didn't want the book to end, and the only reason I didn't finish it in record time, is because I was trying to draw it out and make it last a little longer.<br /><br />A Keeper.rough, she fights for a love that seems doomed with one of the most unlikely of men; his name is Jason Horne, and he is handsome and tough.

I've never read a Suzanne Brockmann novel before, but I get the impression that she's well-loved by her fans.  Perhaps love has blinded them to the flaws of FOREVER BLUE.  I give this book 3 & 1/2 stars.<br /><br />While I must admit, that the book is another, which I read in record time, I felt cheated in the end:  Carter 'Blue' McCoy (ironic name given the coy feel of this story) and Lucy Tait are two characters who start off making the reader think they will be very unique romance novel leads--that is, unconventionally and refreshingly direct and honest with their thoughts and feelings.  Nonetheless, Suzanne Brockmann very conveniently...and frustratingly decided to throw a roadblock 'mystery' up between them, putting the two would-be lovers on opposite sides for too much of the book.<br /><br />To be brief, Blue is a Navy Seal who has taken a vacation to visit his hometown and to be the best man in the wedding of his stepbrother...and Blue's highschool sweetheart.  Local rookie cop, Lucy Tait, who has had a crush on Blue since highschool starts off as a tool for Blue to use to release some sexual steam and a way for Lucy to make her dreams a reality.  Their first date goes awry, but they both find that they have bigger problems on their hands when the next day finds Blue's stepbrother dead...and Blue a prime suspect.  When Lucy is assigned the lead on the case, fate takes the choice of 'romance' off the menu for Blue and Lucy until the murder is solved...or does it??<br /><br />Well, while the first steaming chapters of dialogue and interaction between these two promised a great deal, they delivered very little.  The two love scenes between these two were not worth the wait, and left this reviewer feeling surprised and let-down.<br /><br />FOREVER BLUE had a great romance foundation that was not built upon properly.  The purported 'love' between Blue and Lucy felt more like hero-worship together with a healthy dose of low self-esteem on Lucy's part and like a case of the little head ruling the big head and a little gratitude and loneliness on the part of Blue.<br /><br />The Navy SEAL information was incredibly interesting and added a lot of depth to Blue; it was fascinating and the most tasty ingredient in Brockmann's literary recipe.  I just wish that more time had been taken to flesh out Lucy, who I think could have been a really marvelous and special character; the tidbits about her having been on the boys' basketball and baseball teams or her life as an entrepreneur...or anything more about her background would have helped the reader 'see' her more clearly.<br /><br />And finally, the story centering on a murder and the ensuing charge hanging over Blue's head was poor for a couple of reasons:  The circumstances and motive didn't really make sense, and was not clearly explained in the rush of final chapters; the victim's involvement and character should have been more developed, both to make the connection to Blue feel more real and to give the reader more insight as to why he would have been involved in the conspiracy.<br /><br />Potentially Incredible, Actually Unsatisfying.big head and a little gratitude and loneliness on the part of Blue.

A PERSONAL MATTER is about Alayna Jackson, who has been dealt some very difficult hands:  losing parents, becoming an impromptu big-sister-mother to her sassy sister, being forced to work tons of jobs she hated in order to make sure there was food on the table and clothes on their bodies....  But most of all, Alayna is underappreciated in all aspects of her life, and she is too invested in everyone but herself.  She is lost for two reasons:  (1) she is blinded to nuances of human character, because of her bitter experiences and prejudices; and (2) she has lived so much for others that she has lost her sense of self, her voice.  When Alayna meets `Ice,' Ben Richards, he is everything she has a problem with:  a White man with authority over her, a person of privilege, a person with a bad attitude.  Sparks fly, and right off...they're not the `good' kind of sparks.<br /><br />A PERSONAL MATTER, which I read in 10 hours-mostly looking for the romance part-was long on soul-searching and short on loving.  This reviewer thinks that Karyn Langhorne was trying to depict the experience of recognition:  recognizing the truth (or lack thereof) in our subjective realities.  And she did a good job capturing this very specific situation-I'm not saying that `all' anyone feels the same way as the characters in the book.  But for a person with Alayna Jackson's background and particular emotional burdens, A PERONAL MATTER struck the `real' chord in this reviewer.  Langhorne has captured someone's reality very accurately.  But, we have to always keep in mind that just because our experiences and beliefs feel very real, they are not always true.  Like my dad once said:  there is no good or bad, better or worse (generally); you have to imagine a very fair, horizontal spectrum with people arranged on it at different points, and then you understand:  we're all different.  And Alayna Jackson seemed to come to this realization by the end of the book.<br /><br />I have a friend that reminds me a lot of the main character in A PERSONAL MATTER, Alayna Jackson:  she and I went to law school together, and I remember that when I met her, she was just about the scariest person in the world to approach.  She just had this stamp on her that said:  `Step to me, and you'll be sorry...whoever you are!'  And because she keeps bringing baggage from her old slices of life to the future, she can't (and won't) see opportunities in-front-of her.<br /><br />The best thing that could have ever happened, happened for my friend, when she went to Atlanta, GA after school.  To hear her tell it, `Hotlanta' was going to be some kind of `Blacktopia,' where just because there were so many Black people, no one would ever be mean to each other, no one would judge anyone, no one would fight, etc.  Of course, she was telling me within a month that she had been mistaken, and why shouldn't she?  We hadn't liked all the other Black students at school, just because they were Black, had we?  Of course not?  Snobs and jerks...and angels and sweethearts come in Black and White.<br /><br />This reviewer doesn't think that A PERSONAL MATTER should have ended anywhere but with the Alayna and Ice agreeing to `try to make it work..'  Like my friend, Alayna had a lot of emotional work to do, and Alayna's progression didn't seem to make her ready for the kind of relationship that Langhorne contrived to have  her consider in the last chapter.  For that matter, Ice didn't seem to be as `ready' for love as he was `impulsive.'  It's not that Alayna and Ice couldn't have ended up together, but just that they probably need another book-the one that lays out the slow progression of their romance since getting the stumbling blocks of mistrust and prejudice out of their way.<br /><br />As and aside, it should be pointed out that Langhorne, Harvard grad and former law professor, very accurately and interestingly depicted the life of law, which really added dimension to the book.<br /><br />Great First Effort.	2005-06-08

I have to say that while lovers of Robin Schone will not find this to be as much of an issue, you really have to hang in there and give GABRIEL'S WOMAN a chance to come together. I consider myself a careful reader, and I was amazed at the number of twists in the story and also the complications in the characters' motivations. I have to say that remembering WHO and WHAT these characters are reputed to be, the believability of the story fell short: professionals of Gabriel's sort, in any period, having suffered through what he suffered.... Well, let me just say that I find it hard to believe that he would be as polished, easy-to-love, or noble--not to mention--alive!<br /><br />In short, given his back-story, I couldn't see how Gabriel came to be the man he was at all. I kept trying to diagram his person and finding all these pieces that did not add up. The most confusing issues for me were: the supposed reason he 'chose' his profession; the supposed reason for his 'hostility' for his friend; the REAL reasons for his own self-hatred; and why the reader is supposed to think that he or his profession is noble.<br /><br />Gabriel's character was not only difficult for me to connect with and believe in; he was strangely silent on the issue of what he wanted, what he preferred and with whom he was in love. Additionally, while the sex was interesting, the darkness of it--lacking any romantic or intimate substance--was disturbing. On the other hand, Schone captured the essence of self-hatred. Now, if this story is one about denial--great! All the characters are conspicuously nonsensical.<br /><br />I loved her short story about the Arab man who had been castrated in his youth who met an older woman widow passing herself off as a prostitute. Now THAT was an excellent balance between dark and light--threaded through with vulnerability, need, fear of rejection and enough intimacy and romance to make everything worth it. I just wasn't buying what she was selling this time.<br /><br />Unforgettable for All the Wrong Reasons.me. <br /> <br /> <br />Unforgettable for All the Wrong Reasons. <br />	2005-06-01

James Ryder, the owner of the apartment that Aunie moves into, isn't trying to get out of Seattle.  A Seattle native, James has long-since moved out of the urban nightmare and the lifestyle that he grew up in and apart of, but he's impatient to really leave it behind-something he can never do as long as the burden of his families' problems and recklessness as well as his own feelings of shame follow him.  In his mind, the obviously abused, fragile-looking Aunie represents more unwanted baggage.  Aunie isn't about to be bullied out of the new apartment that she loves, and James doesn't want another walking, talking responsibility to move in under his roof.  This inauspicious emotional setting is where PRESENT DANGER really begins.<br /><br />With a simple and fabulous plot and 3-dimensional characters telling stories that many of us would never hear otherwise-giving us a view into worlds, cultures and perspectives that for some of us are as foreign as another country-PRESENT DANGER has all the ingredients for that elusive `perfect' book.  However, in this reviewer's opinion, after Andersen gets all her passengers packed and on-board, ready for an exciting trip, the train mysteriously seems to stall at the station.<br /><br />Early on, problem began for this reviewer.  It isn't the clever way that Andersen captures the essence of Aunie's `Southern-ness' with her frequent use of `Ah' for `I' or `gawd' instead of `God.'  No, it isn't anything as trivial as that:  the details of Aunie's deep south experience and of James' grim life growing up in the hellish apartment projects and surrounding area called the `Terrace'.  Texture is what these details and the multitudinous, unique characters bring to this literary landscape.  Realism too.  But while Andersen does a great job of telling the story that works at your emotions more than your head (though there is some force-feeding), the thriller (or is it the romance??) seems not to move once Aunie gets to Seattle; her stalker is really pretty much absent until the last couple chapters.  And if PRESENT DANGER is a romance, these lovers spend way too much time apart for my taste.<br /><br />As a book, PRESENT DANGER is somewhat confusing-that is, the reader isn't quite sure whether it is a suspense/thriller or a romance.  As a suspense/thriller, Susan Andersen would only earn 2 stars; the romance angle garners her an extra 2 and ½.<br /><br />Generally Good, With a Few Tweaks Could Really Be Perfect.f `God.'

True enough, a lot of my favorites have copyrights from the late seventies, early eighties and early nineties....  My tastes always have run to early Harlequin Presents Editions, Harlequin American Romances, Harlequin Superromances as well as early Silhouette Special Editions, Silhouette Intimate Moments and early Loveswept Romances.  Silhouette Dreamscapes have helped to add texture to my romance palette over the years.<br /><br />More recently, I went down a different path and experimented with the Harlequin Blaze series.  To me, the Blaze series is much more risqu&eacute;.  One or two that I read were wicked and incredibly good.  Some others seemed merely to be vessels upon which their authors floated across to their readers a whole lot of poor writing and meaningless love scenes.<br /><br />In SHOCKINGLY SENSUAL, Callie Ryder, a `shock jock' on the cusp of national fame, finds herself being stalked by an anonymous listener.  When her business manager hires the Cardasian Personal Security Services and Luke Cardasian is assigned as Callie's bodyguard, sparks fly.  As Callie finds that she's been hiding behind fushia hair, a naughty mouth and saucy demeanor, Luke begins to wonder if his military work in Limbasa has been a means of avoiding living life for himself.  And so, when these two outwardly different people begin to see that they have more in common than a mutual attraction, things begin to get interesting.<br /><br />It seems to me that to write the traditionally shorter books that Harlequin puts out an author almost has to have a grasp of the elusive short-storytelling technique.  The foundation for the story has to be laid down quickly and yet subtly.  In SHOCKINGLY SENSUAL, Lori Wilde really force feeds some of her ideas to the reader.  However, the main idea of an experienced woman tutoring a beautiful, sensitive man about lovemaking while simultaneously learning how to love is simply fascinating and helps make up for some the issues with story development.  Also, the characters of Callie and Luke are sufficiently interesting and developed enough to keep readers interested in their relationship, to make readers care about them.<br /><br />I honestly didn't expect a Blaze to be that good, but it was pretty good.

I give the book two stars for the effort I know it takes to sit down and write anything, but I was not impressed.  I was talking with a good friend of mine the other day about the latest trends in romance novels:  authors are taking liberties with their period pieces-mixing in vampires, time-travelers and any manner of fantasy with equal parts of historical inaccuracy and gratuitous sex scenes sprinkled on every other page.  I don't mind a sex scene or six.  I don't even mind too much when authors use a little poetic license to help them expand the borders of history to include an ingenious and outrageous fantasy story; what I really don't care for is repetitive, melodramatic dialogue, embellished, overworked descriptions and hollow, slow-moving stories....  Oh, and can someone please loan Ms. Joy their thesaurus?  How many times can we look at Rejar's `sultry' face or hear his `sultry' voice?  Goodness gracious!<br /><br />REJAR is a story that is obviously connected to a set of other books-that is, readers will get to play `where are they now' with characters that I imagine appear in others of Dara Joy's books, and they will also be introduced to a character that Joy seems to be setting up for his own book sometime in the future.  Rejar, the `gifted,' is not from earth, nor is he from Regency England though most of the book is set in this period.  It is in this era of history that Rejar meets the book's somewhat annoying and thoroughly unbelievable heroine, Lilac.  Though Joy contrives to use the mystery surrounding the effects of Rejar's time travel to create tension and substitute it for the lack of character development, Joy sabotages herself with prose that leaves the reader anticipating a very obvious and banal disposition.<br /><br />Saucy, too progressive behavior and (wannabe) steamy sex do not substitute for a good plot, and character development needs to be more than taking off clothes.  In the case of REJAR, the love scenes were so over-talked that they were more silly than steamy.  His `utter sensuality and masculine beauty []' here and the `vision of masculine perfection []' there or `the air of steamy sensuality [],' which he apparently `embodied,' dripped,' and `tasted' gets to be a bit much page after page.  It gets boring when this kind of sloppy, exaggerated writing comprises most of the plot, particularly when the reader knows the genre as defined by better authors-where the books not only have a plot but use language so skillfully.<br /><br />The way it-romance writing-should be done, the loves scenes ought to become integral to the plot and the development of the characters, not something that seems to be thrown into the book to titillate or sell more books.<br /><br />Like my friend, I guess I'm looking for characters who act responsibly, who follow the manners and morals of their time.<br /><br />It Was Almost 400 Pages Long.

US	28741093	R31SV8RORU2JEH	0451191846	404861999	Between Friends	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Starts in the Beginning; Ends with a Beginning....	This book is one about being lost and subsequently found:  there is lost identity and found acceptance; there is lost life and found family; there is lost respect and found dignity; there is lost history and found truth.  In BETWEEN FRIENDS, people who have lost their way manage to find their way back and teach the reader about the differences between looking and seeing or hearing and listening.<br /><br />Another record was set with BETWEEN FRIENDS.  I read it in 11 hours.  To summarize:  print journalist, Dallas Oliver is a person who has had a hard time and been made better because of her trials.  Because of being perceived as a Black person, she has been vilified and victimized.  Because of being perceived as `not Black enough,' she has been ostracized and criticized.  Ex Navy SEAL, Alex Marco can understand Dallas' feelings of isolation, shame and confusion as a poor kid from Brooklyn and illegitimate son.  And when Alex intervenes to protect a young Dallas, a foundation is laid for a connection that no amount of time apart can erode.<br /><br />If you are expecting a traditional romance, then I think you might not be pleased with BETWEEN FRIENDS.  It is, in the final analysis, a story that explores a bond between two people-and amorphous feeling of connectedness and intimacy between them.  While there are very steamy love scenes, many of them may not feature the characters that you might hope or expect.  For me, this did create a sense of...dissatisfaction as I reflected upon the book.<br /><br />It doesn't quite make sense to me (although there is an attempt to clear this up toward the end of the book) that Alex becomes...`distracted' by another woman during much of BETWEEN FRIENDS.  \\"What he wanted and what he got seemed to keep missing each other []\\" Sandra Kitt writes.  Alex, by his own admission was getting \\"...only some of what he wanted []\\" with the other woman.  And yet, he doesn't make a direct beeline for Dallas.  This troubles me.<br /><br />He had been fascinated with Dallas, had felt some strong emotion for her in the aftermath of fulfilling her teenage proposition, and felt protective and intensely close to her upon meeting her again as an adult.  It is clear that he found her attractive, easy to talk to and was ostensibly unaffected by her perceived Blackness....  Why then, would he start something with another woman?  With her friend.<br /><br />On the other hand, Dallas has her own unfinished business to sort through when her childhood protector comes back on the scene.  This is maybe what helps keep the reader `distracted' from what could fester into true disappointment with the book.  And though the soulmates in this book spend too much time apart for my tastes, I was satisfied that the book ends up with the lovers on the precipice of a completely new relationship.<br /><br />Also, Dallas is a wonderful example of feminism-a woman trying to be what she wants to be and do what she wants to do without being punished for making choices or being barred from making those choices.  Maybe feminism isn't the word:  she lives to find a way to be who she is-both Black and White, a woman, a professional-without being boxed in by others' expectations of her.<br /><br />And I think that Kitt is trying to press the envelope regarding prejudice coming from any group of people...against any person.  Any person who says that \\"all Black women\\" or \\"all\\" anything should act and think and look and talk in certain kinds of ways is trying to lay a top-down model of their options on them.<br /><br />Maybe because of what Dallas refers to as an expectation to pull `double duty,' she is probably one of the only characters to accept that the violence she has endured, the losses she has racked up, who she should love and whether she is a good writer has nothing to do with her skin color or hair texture.  She seems to be well aware that good and bad actions and beliefs come from people of all colors.<br /><br />Liked it A lot, ButI Could See Why Others Might Not.r />Liked it A lot, But I Could See Why Others Might Not. <br />	2005-05-12
US	28741093	R42VNJOBYXDFL	0553581279	51302526	The Silver Metal Lover	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Loved the Lover...	It's hard to categorize this book.  THE SILVER METAL LOVER isn't like any other book I've ever read even though I've read romantic sci-fi/fantasy before.  A lot of the reviewers, whose praise I read before purchasing SILVER, mentioned having read this book as teenagers.  Maybe that's part of what made SILVER so different from many of the books that I've read as an adult-that it's told from the perspective of a teenager, Jane.  Jaen.  Jain.<br /><br />SILVER is set in a not-so-distant future in which robots are a part of everyone's lives-in the form of train conductors and taxi drivers for regular people or as servants for the rich.  Jane is a poor little rich girl who follows all the rules...until she meets one of Electronic Metals' latest models, an experimental design from the Sophisticated Formats line.  He is a Silver Ionized Locomotive Electronic Robot, Silver.  And he is beautiful...in every way.  If you don't believe in love at first sight, read SILVER.<br /><br />Don't let the narrator's age fool you; SILVER is a book that will probably touch the heart of any person who reads it regardless of age.  There is a tremendous sense of time to the way the book is written.  And SILVER is made richer for it.  I mean to say:  because of the way the story is told, the way Tanith Lee never gets ahead of herself, as a reader you will find that you discover truths as they are revealed to the characters.

King, Lorie O'Clare, Jaci Burton and Lora Leigh.  They are tied together by fantasy themes and preternatural or supernatural characters.  They are also mostly one-dimensional, though they vary in the level of heat they inspire.  I know I don't usually like anthologies.  Usually, one or a couple authors has to compensate for the other authors' weaker stories.  More authors than usual stepped up to the plate, I suppose.  However, in my opinion, Burton did it the best with RUNNING MATE.<br /><br />#1.  Moon Lust by Sherri L. King.<br /><br />Brianna goes to Russia, fulfilling a promise to her dear Uncle Alexei.  All you will learn about Russia, if you've never been is that the Ural Mountains are \\"breathtaking,\\" \\"cold\\" and \\"humbling.\\"  Likewise, King fails to expound on Brianna and the male lead, Ivan Davidovich Basileus (who gets to third base before Brianna even knows his name); King fails to elucidate the details of their relationship beyond the bedroom.  The execution of their love story is as fake as Ivan's name:  sex, sex and more sex.  No talking aside from repetitive statements from Ivan about the moon, but (though we never actually hear any conversations or humorous anecdotes or sharing of secrets) apparently they \\"enjoyed an easy and fast friendship,\\" easy sex and even easier love.  Crazy.  Ivan learned most of what he knew about Brianna when she was passed out rambling in her sleep...including what he knew about her private parts!  MOON LUST didn't even attempt to pretend there was a plot beyond the bedroom action (which was OKAY; the scenes, not the story, in FETISH were better) and there wasn't any character development.  This is a bit of fluff to read, if you've got a few minutes on your hands and nothing else to do.<br /><br />Okay Porn:  No stars.<br /><br />#2. Lunewolf:  Pack Law by Lorie O'Clare<br /><br />Like lots of...people, Sophie Rousseau is part of a culture in which...marriages are arranged.  Unlike most, Sophie is obliged to make a life-long connection with not one other...person, but three.<br /><br />Unlike MOON LUST, the `love scenes' in LUNEWOLF were very spicy and are definitely good for getting the juices flowing.  O'Clare proves it's true that down-n-dirty stories are okay, even absent a plot, if you don't try to pretend that it's more than erotic porn.<br /><br />Sexy:  One star.<br /><br />#3.  Devlin Dynasty:  Running Mate by Jaci Burton<br /><br />Senator Jason Devlin appears to be the most eligible bachelor in Washington-that is, a handsome, thirty-something Senator who happens to be single.  Who cares about his politics, right?  Well, Kelsey Harper cares.  She wants to know who the charming Senator really is underneath the polish.  As a reporter for her father's paper, The Washington Oracle, Kelsey's after a one-on-one interview with Devlin.  Well, Kelsey finds the answers to her questions in more ways than one.<br /><br />Only Burton really attempted to craft a short STORY.  Though everything is moving quickly (there are only 58 pages in which to get it all done), Burton attempts to throw in some of the typical markers of romance.  Here, there is at least a clear framework-potential.  Here, there is a framework for a book that could be both exciting and suspenseful.<br /><br />Oh, and the `love scenes' were positively steamy.  I guess I should use those special code words:  not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Good:  Two Stars<br /><br />#4.  Wolfe's Hope by Lora Leigh<br /><br />I hoped for more after reading a Breeds book.  Wolfe's Hope is another book about genetically altered individuals who can mark their one true mate.  In this case, the story concerns Wolfe and his one true mate, Hope.<br /><br />I can say about Leigh that if you've read her before, then you know not to expect much as far as plot or character development.  It's just a matter of how hot (see TEMPTING THE BEAST) or...odd (see SARAH'S SEDUCTION or MARLY'S CHOICE) the story is going to be, in my opinion.<br /><br />As usual, sizzling and shallow:  One star<br /><br />All in all, pretty okay.all, pretty okay.	2005-03-30
US	28741093	R2QI8ZE3VF6G36	0312315716	860060808	Little Children: A Novel	Books	4	9	12	N	Y	An Interesting Perspective	The lesson I gathered from LITTLE CHILDREN is that from the perspective of author, Tom Perrotta, most people are hitchhikers with no destination; they accept rides from strangers and go wherever that ride takes them for good or for ill.  More specifically, most people only pretend to know what they're doing, pretend they've made choices.  All that these people have really chosen, Perrotta seems to be saying, is misery and confusion.  It's a story about seeing versus blindness.  Beauty can blind us to faults and imperfections.  And an unattractive exterior can likewise obscure the human sameness of one person to another.  We can choose not to see the truth about others.  Just as easily, we can hide who we truly are even from ourselves.<br /><br />In LITTLE CHILDREN, Perrotta puts the housemother story on its head with handsome housedad, Todd.  Todd takes his 3-year old son, Aaron to the park, plays with him, sings Raffi songs with him and actually likes it!  When Sarah, mother of 3-year old, Lucy tells him that the other mothers call him the `Prom King,' he is as pleased as Sarah would be if someone were to call her a `suburban woman.'<br /><br />Where you may find a problem calling Todd and Sarah a hero or heroine, is probably at the same crossroads in the story that I began to feel a little conflicted (which a-c-t-u-a-l-l-y takes place pretty early on in the story). It may be that where you come out on the moral conflict presented by the relationship between Todd and Sarah will decide whether you like LITTLE CHILDREN.  I hope not, because I think it has independent value notwithstanding that.<br /><br />When the story begins, Todd is supposed to be preparing to take the bar exam...for the third time.  His gorgeous wife, Kathy is an up-and-coming director ready to have Todd become \\"a successful lawyer, making enough money to support the family in the style she believed they deserved to live, while at the same time freeing her to have more children (and more child care), and to work only when she wanted, and only on projects she believed in.\\"  She doesn't care that Todd doesn't want to be a lawyer (and never really did)...or that in lieu of passing the bar he's really learned how to grill a mean salmon fillet.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Sarah is living a life that she blames on one \\"moment of weakness.\\" There is no other way for Sarah to explain how she ended up married to a man with questionable sexual habits/fetishes.  And though she tries to fit into the cookie-cutter suburban lifestyle, Sarah's tendency to forget to pack her daughter's snack every once and awhile as well as the fact that she has not perfected the art of being tired and complaining about it like the other mothers, makes it unlikely that she will ever be anything but an outcast among this exclusive set.<br /><br />The questions I had to ask myself were:  (1) Is Sarah an adulterous, immoral fool or a courageous heroine, brave enough to search for love-to want more for herself (your answer may change a couple times between the beginning and the ending); and (2) Is Todd just an immoral jerk looking for someone who will validate him, someone with lower standards, or his he lost...finding that he is not what anyone would have expected him to be?<br /><br />Perrotta has obviously come to some very wise understandings about the world.  He sees that lots of people do not make choices, but act like children and go wherever the wind blows.  Perrotta also describes those mundane, smaller details of human behavior and interactions with a realism and attention to detail that makes you wonder if he's been spying on you:  while you chatted with your mother, when you failed the bar or when you've spent all day at home with the kids, daddy (in this case, mommy) walks in and they forget all about you....<br /><br />I loved some things about LITTLE CHILDREN:  (1) partly because Todd (gender and a few other things aside) is living my life, and Perrotta told the story so realistically; (2) because of the surprising way that Perrotta has of putting a thing:  you've felt that way before but have never had it expressed so clearly; and (3) because of the way that I was made to feel a connection to each character.  Even if their existence in the story was simply to serve as a contrast/foil or to say something that Perrotta wanted to say, none of them were wasted.  The ending however, felt incomplete.  Maybe it was supposed to leave the reader with an unsatisfied, unfinished feeling, as this entire book seems to be a reminder that life isn't full of perfect fairytale endings.  Even so I give LITTLE CHILDREN four stars instead of five because of an ending that felt too easy and a little discordant.<br /><br />Will Really Make You Think.has of putting a thing:  you've felt that way before but have never had it expressed so clearly; and (3) because of the way that I was made to feel a connection to each character.

Having read only one other book by Kleypas, DREAMING OF YOU, I was hopeful that SOPHIA'S LOVER would follow in its footsteps and please me just as much.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />Lady Sophia Sydney is the orphaned daughter of a viscount.  After the loss of her parents, Sophia and her younger brother, John have only themselves to rely upon, and they find themselves doing things quite out of the ordinary for children of nobility in order to survive.  Following a troubled path into a life of crime, John is eventually caught stealing.  Both John's and Sophia's life is changed forever when a magistrate sentences John, a juvenile offender to one year aboard an old, unseaworthy ship used as a prison for his crime.<br /><br />Believing that magistrate, Sir Ross Cannon sealed her brother's terrible fate, Sophia answers Cannon's add seeking a personal assistant.  Sophia's goal is to bring Cannon down in the most devastating way that she can imagine-by making him fall in-love with her, breaking his heart and ruining his professional reputation in the process.<br /><br />First, Sophia disappoints on several levels.  She is an example of a trend in which authors simply throw characters into a time period and endow them with behaviors that could have never happened for that time.  For that matter, so is Sir Ross Cannon.  Sophia is just too progressive for her time and position.  For instance, she is not ashamed to have had an affair with a married man during at her last post; her discomfort stems more from the fact that it ended badly than from the fact that it occurred at all.  Sophia is also not as committed to her revenge as one would think, given her motivation.  While it is possible that she would have qualms with her plan once it was set in motion rather than just planned in the abstract, she gave over her outrage, her disgust for Cannon too easily.  Sophia should have been more conflicted and blind to Cannon's good qualities.<br /><br />Cannon too suffered from anachronistic beliefs and behaviors.  For instance, when a poor woman seeks his assistance, because the old woman's daughter has been locked in her room by a husband who is punishing his wife for cuckolding him, Cannon reacts with an icy rage:  \\"In my opinion, a man who truly loves a woman would never intentionally harm her, no matter how great the betrayal,\\" he says of this `brutalization.'  Even today, the `provocation' of an affair is considered a mitigating factor in charging a man who KILLS his wife.  It is just hard to imagine Cannon would have such forward-thinking beliefs, going so far as to entirely overlook Sophia's own extra-marital affair.  It doesn't seem to faze him at all.<br /><br />And there were love scenes that bordered on the impossible, language used that was completely out-of-character and abrupt accelerations in Sophia's and Cannon's relationship:  For instance, while Sophia is organizing a ball for Cannon's mother(I don't know how this jump was made), Cannon's married brother, Mathew improperly solicits and attacks Sophia.  When Cannon walks in on this, Mathew leaves and Sophia tells him that she was trying to seduce his brother (to discourage his interest in her).  However, Cannon is not discouraged and within seconds has Sophia down on the carpet and his pants undone.  By the end of the weekend, Cannon has proposed, but before the weekend began, the two barely knew anything about the other.<br /><br />SOPHIA'S LOVER was light on historical accuracy, realism, character consistency and satisfying love scenes.<br /><br />A Disappointment.rs.

A great book exceeds your best expectations. A good book is one that meets your expectations.  MR. PERFECT was good for me.  If you're looking for a genuine mystery, suspense-thriller, then MR. PERFECT will not fully satisfy you.  If you're looking for a sweet romance, then you'll find MR. PERFECT a little dark.<br /><br />Jaine Bright(misspelling of `Janine' on her birth certificate)  is one of four friends who, while releasing the frustrations of being women in a male-dominated workplace, decides to create a List of traits that one would find in the perfect man.  While the list starts off with relatively reasonable requirements like `faithfulness,' the List also jokingly includes a not-so-tame requirement for above-average length of male...equipment.  When the List accidentally finds its way into the writers of the informal company newsletter, the Ladies of the List find themselves thrust into the spotlight and gaining the attention of the nation...and MR. PERFECT's very disturbed villain.<br /><br />Detective Sam Donovan, Jaine's rugged and challenging neighbor soon becomes more than the focus of her love/hate attraction, but also her protector and friend as the danger escalates.<br /><br />First, Howard's idea for the villain was a respectable one.  However, the execution of the antagonist's story seemed more like an in-depth sketch or framework for a story that could have been incredible, if it were fully developed.  Here and there, the antagonist talked to himself in the mirror, and though these parts were good, they were not enough to make the thriller part of the book feel complete.<br /><br />A big problem with the book for me was that MR. PERFECT's villain just was not...present enough.  For me, the part about a thriller psychopath that makes it feel real and complete is the view inside his head-that is the unraveling of his twisted psyche.  This wasn't done effectively, in my opinion.  Howard opened with a childhood scene that left it up to the reader to imagine what made MR. PERFECT's antagonist so bad.  Then there was basically nothing else said to help develop him other than his bathroom mirror soliloquies.  More flashbacks, more dialogue and detailed description of the scenes in which the bad guy did his dastardly deeds would have added to the book.  The last couple of chapters had Donovan visiting some key people and getting some questions answered about the villain, and I really felt like it came out of order.  Profilers, while not being able to give those kind of specifics, should have been verbalizing probable descriptions of the killer and likely explanations for his behavior.  I would have liked to see:  (1) some detailed profiling discussions; (2) more of what actually happened to his victims; and also (3) more of the story from his point of view (which I understand could have been tricky).  The development of the antagonist, in short, left something to be desired.<br /><br />And second, while the women of MR. PERFECT and their issues were very realistic and interesting, they drew away from the traditional lightness of most romance/suspense novels, I think.  Infidelity is an issue.  And the fact that a lot of the secondary characters did not get a clearly happy ending was quite a surprise.  It wasn't that Howard did such a good job of creating a connection to any of them, but I still did not expect these characters' conclusions to be so grim.<br /><br />Finally, MR. PERFECT gets four stars for the unique character of Jaine, who is both smart and funny.  Most fascinatingly, Jaine is curiously vulnerable and tough at the same time.  She is a truly 3-dimensional character who manages to do what I think real women do everyday:  be strong without being a man.  And Jaine's relationship with Sam will make you laugh out loud as much as their love scenes will make you sweat.<br /><br />Only as Good as Your Expectations Allow.t up to the reader to imagine what made MR.

To summarize:  Anti-heroine, Leonessa dan Ranul (\\"Nessa\\") is a Shielder, a species hunted by the mind-destroying Controllers and forced to live an impoverished and desperate existence.  Shielders also share telepathic skills, which are limited to the ability to sense others of the Shielder race.  A victim of a culture who embraces the euthanasia of its members who are found unfit, Nessa's seizures and heavy limp have made her an outsider.  In her entire colony, Nessa's only support comes in the form of secret visits from her brother, Jarek and her furry pet lanrax, Turi.<br /><br />When the Controllers release the genetically-engineered Orana virus, which afflicts Shielders alone, in-spite-of her forced estrangement from the other Shielders in her colony including her own parents, Nessa volunteers to help save her people.  Specifically, Nessa volunteers to be injected with the Orana virus in order to facilitate undetectable transportation of the virus to a secure lab and to find a cure.  When Nessa's ship breaks down, Captain Chase McKnight (\\"Chase\\") responds to her distress signal.  Chase is a shadower, a glorified bounty-hunter for the Controllers.  Time is running out for Nessa as the virus incubates, and she needs to get to the lab at Sonoma.  However, Chase has ideas of his own as he pursues his own demons.<br /><br />While THE SHIELDER was strong on build-up and the development of its two main characters, the book was weak on resolution of the main conflicts/issues-namely, the battle with the Orana virus and also with the antagonist, Dansan.<br /><br />First, when Chase's emotional and psychological crisis that is intimately tied to his work as a doctor and his perceived failure in the medical field meets a the crossroads of Nessa's deadly illness and the fate of her people, more time should have been invested in the science of dealing with the illness and with the hero's expertise in the field.  There wasn't much talk about his skills beyond bandaging backs and cleansing scrapes.  Even Chase's creation of the medication for Nessa's seizures was skimmed over where I felt there should have been more detailed explanation and description of the process.  I'm not asking for a medical journal, but only some more description to sustain the realism of the story.<br /><br />Second, I felt that Dansan was a cookie-cutter enemy and concerning Chase's interaction with the enemy, the only thing not `form' or `standard' about it was that Dansan was a woman.  The final confrontation between the two was Scooby-Doo-ish:  Chase confronted Dansan and she basically said, `Yep, I did it all.  You got me.'<br /><br />Finally, the ending was likewise kind of corny and easy (and happy), if unlikely.  It was hard to believe that parents who had never shown Nessa love or respect or even acknowledged her existence would suddenly make a complete 180 degree change of heart.<br /><br />THE SHIELDER gets four stars for good development of the romance, the sci-fi world and the development of Nessa and Chase.  It does not get the fifth star, because I believe Catherine Spangler should have put forth more effort in tying up loose ends, developing the `doctor side' of Chase and scientific description of the battle with Orana.<br /><br />Very Good.and with the hero's expertise in the field.

Even the sultry and innovative love scenes could not save this book from a low rating.<br /><br />The story goes something like this: the heroine, Blythe 53-2310 (the fifty-third `Blythe' born in the year 2310) is a clairvoyant or an emotional telepath, if you will.  Blythe works for Ecstasy Incorporated and has been sent back in time to 1785 Scotland to prove herself after some questionable behavior on Blythe's part during her last assignment.  Blythe is assigned what her bosses think will be a tough nut to crack:  Vampire Viking Darach MacKenzie a.k.a. Black Varin Kylandssonn, the scourge of Scotland 500 years prior.  Blythe's job is to bring \\"...calm and joy into the lives of those teetering on the edge of emotional breakdowns...[using] a variety of methods sanctioned by the Intergalactic Association for the Relief of Stress and Depression to make people happy and productive again.\\" Blythe believes the assignment to Darach will assure her failure.<br /><br />While Blythe is sure that Darach is depressed, his Vampire abilities keep her from reading his emotions.  Additionally, she finds that she has come up against probably the first individual who can invade her own thoughts and emotions.  It's clear that Blythe has her work cut out for her.<br /><br />This was a time-travel romance-I'll give Bangs that.  However, the silliness of Blythe's future-speak, the simplicity of Blythe's thoughts, as well as the nitwitted reactions of the clearly clueless heroine, rather than being charming and humorous, clanged against my common sense and made it impossible to sink into the story.<br /><br />On the other hand, Darach brought to mind a character akin to Gabaldon's `Jamie' from her OUTLANDER series and really made me wish:  (1) that the heroine would stop being so `funny' and (2) that the corny lightheartedness of parts of the storyline had been drawn with more subtlety so as to be in sync with the underlying darkness of the hero and his past.  In brief, this book would not have been so bad if the hero had been less intriguing.  Darach offered possibilities that the heroine and plot were not well-matched for in MASTER OF ECSTASY.<br /><br />Darach with his strong accent, heart-rending past and terrible burden of duty seemed like a character honed and created by Bangs for an entirely different story-a story that Bangs got tired of writing and threw together with a sloppy and easy throw-away idea about a girl from the future.<br /><br />Can't Remember if I've Read Bangs Before; Don't Know if I'll Read Bangs Again.d been drawn with more subtlety so as to be in sync with the underlying darkness of the hero and his past.

US	28741093	R3O82WT9TKS2Y5	1843606143	612388176	Marly's Choice	Books	3	81	110	N	N	Debauched & Dumb	I read MARLY'S CHOICE in record speed:  I started reading it at approximately 10 p.m. last night and finished at not even 2 a.m. this morning.  Not so fast.  I flew through pages that constituted Leigh's feeble attempt to create the suspense befitting a \\"mystery\\" or \\"thriller,\\" which fell completely flat.  The characters are as well drawn as the actors in a porno are deep.  The obligatory storyline is more like an excuse to throw in gratuitous and sometimes borderline-perverse 'love' scenes.  There is no balance or thought to realism.  No depth.  No character development...that makes any sense.<br /><br />The scheme that Leigh sets out is something like this:  Three boys are forced to endure abuse and sexual depravity.  When these boys grow into men, the Augusts, Cade, Brock and Sam, they are haunted by what has happened to them.  One of the most startling aftereffects of their abuse is their inabilty to show each other love.<br /><br />According to Leigh, the way the August brothers experience love, feel complete, and resolve emotional distress is by sharing the \\"one true love\\" of one of the brothers.  For instance, if Marly is Cade's one true love, then Brock and Sam have to join in for a menage-a-quatre.  Ridiculous!  This is the 'solution' that the brothers have arrived at after many years of excess.  They supposedly 'need' this brotherly orgy to take place in order to put their psychological demons to rest.<br /><br />The August brothers convince Marly that she needs to sleep with them all in order to show her love for Cade.  And, believe it or not (I don't) the other brothers miraculously love Marly too--\\"not as deeply\\" but in their own way.<br /><br />It would have been less absurd to me if Leigh did not set out this silly premise holding out the appearance of a legitimate plot.  In brief, the dominant nature of Cade was very exciting and even the dirty way that he had of talking and dealing with Marly would have been more palatable if he weren't contemporaneously professing deep love and respect for her.

After reading BEYOND INNOCENCE, BEYOND SEDUCTION and most recently, THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER, I was sure that I could never be disappointed by a Holly book.<br /><br />Each of her books have told very different stories and introduced very different characters, but I've loved each one up until I read STRANGE ATTRACTIONS.  While I agree with the reviewer that said:  'if you tell me a good story, I'll like it,' and that 3-dimensional characters that make you care about them are the key to loving a book (instead of just liking it), I don't think that STRANGE ATTRACTIONS lived up to these requirements.<br /><br />Charity Wills is a young woman who has a hard life and a hard time keeping a job.  She doubts her intelligence and competence.  In general, she's been unlucky.  Specifically, she's been unlucky in love.  When Eric Berne, a lovely-looking man pulls her aside, she is sure it is not because he wants to invite her home to meet the parents.  In her mind, Charity is the girl from the wrong side of the tracks; in the social order, Charity is sure Eric is not someone who should be with her.<br /><br />Charity is right that Eric has another motive--namely to make her an offer regarding an opportunity that will supposedly tap into her potential--sexually and mentally.  Eric is a third-party intermediary for B.G. Grantham, who does not believe that Charity is stupid, but rather unmotivated: if Charity's work challenged her, she would excel.  For B.G., it is a matter of finding what motivates all of his human subjects, and Charity is no exception.<br /><br />Although I must admit that I my curiosity was piqued by the idea of an intimate relationship between B.G. and Eric, as it played out, their interactions left me feeling uncomfortable and cold.  I did not experience the relationship between B.G. and Eric as tender or sexually exciting.<br /><br />Additionally, I didn't feel that Eric's character was fully fleshed out.  But, where Eric struck me as having genuine feelings, B.G. rarely seemed interested in being human.  He was more interested in experimenting on human subjects.<br /><br />Enter the notion that I loved about the book, spoken by B.G., the scientist:  \\"No one understands how, time after time, I come up with solutions....[It is because] I believe I can.  Emotionally, I feel as if I have the answer before I do.\\"  This is what I loved about STRANGE ATTRACTIONS:  Quantum Physics, the idea of alternate realities, the affect of consciousness on our world, the power of the mind and unlocking its potential, creating your world through awareness of your power to do so.<br /><br />In the final analysis, Charity was a lovable and cheeky character that I think readers will root for, if they read the book.  But, I didn't care for Eric's bisexual relationship with B.G.  And I didn't hope for Charity to end up with Eric, because he was so obviously in-love with B.G. already.  Charity deserved better.<br /><br />I will read Holly again, definitely.  I do agree that she is incredibly creative and gifted, but no one is perfect.<br /><br />Sadly Unsatisfied.shed out.

There's erotic-romantic-fantasy out there that's fun.  It's provocative.  And it's also depthless.  I read those, but I don't hold my breath.  I don't think back on the characters in those books.<br /><br />Both Inspector Adrian Phillips, DEMON'S lead male and Roxanne McAllister, DEMON'S heroine, have strength of character and body that they must come to recognize over time as well as an overwhelming passion and sensuality just bubbling underneath polite emotional shells of vulnerability and shyness.<br /><br />Adrian isn't a normal male lead.  There are cracks in what would otherwise be the typical romantica/fantasy author's Ken doll, if you will.  He's a sensitive detective who follows all the rules...and looks for lost children on his time off.<br /><br />Roxanne McAllister is a painter who wants to fit into the world she lives in and is simultaneously unwilling to sacrifice the beliefs and behaviors that make her unique.  Her generosity as exhibited by her informal fostering of two street children is not the only thing that sets Roxanne apart; and when a distinguished and eerily familiar Yama `demon' shows up at her door one day to engage Roxanne's expertise as an artist, her awareness of just how different she really is deepens.<br /><br />I think Holly uses Roxanne to represent the reality for most women (and maybe men too) that individuals are often desired for the same qualities about which the world's most harsh judgments are made-sexuality, strength and race (species, rather), among other things.  Roxanne is as in need of love as Adrian, and the love story between Roxanne and Adrian is as tender as it is seductive.<br /><br />Holly's crafting of the story, Adrian, Roxanne (and all the characters really) is masterful.  With both lead characters, I think Holly strives to bring androgyny to gender stereotypes-that is, showing that behaviors that may seem distinguishably male or female can and do exist in BOTH genders in reality.  Holly has created a world that made me think-about stereotypes, about the imperfection of love, and most importantly, about myself.<br /><br />Furthermore, the fantasy foundation of DEMON and the underlying story regarding the Yama `demons' and the humans is intellectually stimulating and very creative.  This sci-fi background is given proper respect and attention, and it does not feel thrown together as an afterthought.<br /><br />Holly's finesse with the 'gray areas' in life (lacking so many extremes in behavior that the subtlety of characterization is properly achieved) allowed for the creation of characters that allow the reader to step into their shoes for awhile, feel pity for them, feel angry for them and keep his or her fingers crossed, hoping that their situations will eventually sort themselves out.<br /><br />Two Thumbs Way Up!g that behaviors that may seem distinguishably male or female can and do exist in BOTH genders in reality.

Moning seemed to expect readers to believe that even though The Hawk had idealism, courage and vulnerability just seething below the surface of his very convincing Lothario `act,' his very own best friend, \\"Grimm\\" would wish a curse upon his head.  In spite of his profligate skirt-chasing The Hawk is in fact, principled and noble.  Hmmm.  It is unreasonable for an author to completely change a character halfway through the book.  I suppose it could be suggested that Moning left a smidge of room for The Hawk to become a hopeless romantic as the book unfolds....<br /><br />However, it's hard for me to believe The Hawk was only a misunderstood hero. He was thoroughly contemptible to the women whom he ran through like used Kleenex.  And his very best friend believed he was in need of a change!<br /><br />And even ignoring the mental leap it takes to accept what I view as inconsistencies in the hero's character, the nasty and astringent relationship between The Hawk and the heroine, Adrienne de Simone was hard to stomach considering I expected to be reading a romance novel.<br /><br />Tension can make the joining all the sweeter, but it seemed that during most of the story the two `lovers' were anything but loving.  At the beginning she hated him while he wanted her (and with very silly underlying reasoning, if you ask me).  Toward the end, they were not even in the same time (time-travel romance).  In the middle, Moning contrived to keep them within striking distance, but with the two never being sweet or warm.  With all the acrimony between the two, the snippets of `romance' were hard to believe or enjoy, and the infrequent `love' scenes felt abrupt.<br /><br />I have enjoyed others of Moning's books, and will read more.  I hope that she will allow the heroes and heroines to love each other more and fight each other less in the future.<br /><br />Vexing.fight each other less in the future.    Vexing.	2005-01-17

But beyond the shameless and licentious erotica, there were some issues with a lack of depth, realism and storyline.  Don't get me wrong:  I am not a prude and reading this kind of MATURE erotica every now and again can spice up anyone's reading life.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me to stomach, however, was the major loophole regarding the heroine, Aerin Peters.  King started off by pursuing a very courageous notion-that a woman who was:  (1) forty seven; (2) beginning to suffer from menopause; and among other things (3) more than 200 pounds-could find a love based upon more than a spectacular exterior.  It seemed at first that King's anti-hero, Violanti D'Arco might actually see something beneath Aerin's culturally unacceptable exterior to treasure.  This was not to be at all.<br /><br />Enter loophole-that is, King enables Aerin to BECOME culturally acceptable.  And it becomes okay for Aerin to be this book's heroine.<br /><br />Aside from this issue, the absence of depth, true character development and any romance (what was I thinking?!) the book was a tasty fantasy treat.  You know what they say about treats, though-too much can spoil your appetite.<br /><br />A bit rich for the blood:)	2005-01-15

From his cockney accent to his subtly expressed self-hatred, I have never before read about another character like him!  And Kleypas did not try to pass off weakness and dullness as innocence in the book's heroine, Sara Fielding.  The emotion between the lovers was intense.  The love scenes were deeply touching and erotic.  And the interaction between the jaded Craven and the 'old maid,' Fielding was refreshingly natural and believable.<br /><br />It is harder for me to analyze a book that I liked so much and found little if anything to fault.  All I can say is that I was amazed that Kleypas' story continued to surprise me and keep me in suspense.  The 'normal' set of events did not present themselves like clockwork, and so I found that from beginning to end I was never anticipating the characters' next moves or dialogue.  This was a great feeling, because where so many authors (sadly) make readers like me feel presentient, I've stumbled upon an author with something new and special to offer.<br /><br />Stays With You.	2004-11-09

The book put me in the mind of Dangerous Liaisons meets a scene out of Last of the Mohicans (all I can say is:  waterfall):  Duke of Seth, Sinjin St. John is the profligate rake who woos women so easily that the stakes must continuously be raised in order to keep the game of love interesting.  When we meet him, the only woman that he really respects or in any way keeps in confidence is his exotic beauty of a lover, The Duchess of Buchan, Cassandra-the trophy wife of the Duke of Buchan.  Sinjin's cynical and independent playmate, Cassandra's life is made of creating intrigue and entertaining herself with new lovers (of which Sinjin is only one).  Chelsea Fergusson, the daughter of an Earl, is the innocent girl with a potential for passion made all the more alluring because of her honesty and youthful openness.<br /><br />As to the problems....  First, sometimes the story endured rough and unreasonable plot twists-that is, aspects of the storyline suffered from abruptness.  I had difficulty sustaining a suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Secondly, another strong criticism I can offer about SINFUL is the force feeding of characters' disposition and motivation that Johnson felt compelled to provide especially at the beginning of the book.  The repetition of statements like:  he had been the `most fascinating rake in the Ton' are unnecessary, especially when Johnson makes this more than obvious with her descriptions of the young Duke's exploits in scene after scene.  If someone is descpicable, don't tell me, I want to say, just let the story unfold so that I can see it for myself and draw (or not) that conclusion.<br /><br />Finally, I wished that Johnson would either decide that she wanted to make the book about a triangle of lovers-Sinjin, Cassandra and Chelsea-or not; Johnson didn't seem to know whether she wanted to delve fully in the relationship between Sinjin and Cassandra or the depth of their...'interest' and affection for each other.  Sometimes, I thought Johnson wanted her to be a part of the story and at other times, Cassandra was treated as a distraction-filler.<br /><br />Otherwise, I would say that the book was good.  A lot of the frustration that I felt reading the book was, to some extent, only natural given the identity of the characters involved and the era in which they were set.<br /><br />I give SINFUL three stars, because:  (1)the love scenes were pretty good (however, Johnson's WICKED scenes really made my pulse race); and (2)I think that I like Johnson as an author.  But this book was not at the top of my literary list:-)<br /><br />Mostly Good, but also too Frequently a Page-Skipper.n for each other.

THE PASSION made me nearly tear up at the end, made me gasp with horror, shout with frustration and anger, clench my fists with the impotent desire to intervene and also want to highlight some passages that were especially simple, wise and touching.<br /><br />I don't know how to express to fellow readers out there how discriminating my tastes are; it is highly unusual for me to feel so fulfilled and yet drained by reading a novel.<br /><br />There are too many authors out there that do not do what Boyd did with this book:  they do not take the time and effort to write the truly difficult stories, the complicated plots, the ugly details of the lows as well as the highs of the characters.  Boyd invested in the full crafting of three-dimensional characters--that I loved, hated, and felt pity for.<br /><br />It is amazing to me how well and how gradually, how subtly and naturally Boyd was able to move me in an emotional journey as I followed the paths of her characters.  I was moved from disgust with a character to pity, toleration, understanding and eventually to fondness, affection and love.  Conversely, Boyd was able to make me see the flaws of characters that I so much wanted to unconditionally love...and I even loved these characters more for knowing that they are only 'human' (tongue in cheek).  Boyd writes with exceptional depth.<br /><br />I loved how Boyd was able to make the characters symbolic devils and angels.  I loved how she was able to make me doubt whether those who so clearly seemed to be evil were evil...or honorable, weak, etc.<br /><br />There were so many subtle lessons for me.  I learned a lot about anger, judgment, pride, what strength is and also about the meaning of love.<br /><br />Anyway, I just really thought this novel was wonderful and moving.  I don't know if I can read anymore in this series though, because of the strength with which the tragedy and beauty of the stories and outcomes upset me and kept me up with dreams nights after I read the novel.  I read the entire novel in one sitting, because it was so enthralling.<br /><br />I always THINK that I want to read writing this good and this deep, but maybe I do like my writing a bit fluffier:-)<br /><br />Brava, Boyd!ghts after I read the novel.

I cannot qualify this request even with an 'unless you have nothing better to do'!<br /><br />Although I expected, after reading the reviews on this site, to be at least charmed by Donovan and titillated by the 'love scenes,' I was disappointed in every way possible.<br /><br />How can I explain it?  The story of our characters, Viola (quite the most terrible name I have ever heard) and Donovan are woven into the current story with arbitrarily placed  vignettes based upon past events in the lives of said characters.  These snippets did not win any of my compassion or understanding for either of the characters.  They simply served to confuse and further delay an already dragging, dull story.<br /><br />The plot, to which I've already alluded, is unimaginative:  a scoundrel seeks the money and associated social status of the the beautiful Viola whom he has coveted from afar since before her misfortune (which he incidentally had a hand in causing in the first place); Viola looks for 'protection' from the beautiful hero (who has a domineering edge), who also has been secretly infatuated with her.  Did I mention the hero is also rich?<br /><br />Viola...Viola...Viola....  Such an ugly name.  Such a mass of contradictions:  Our heroine, who refers to herself as \\"short, scrawny, and pallid,\\"  contemporaneously receives proposals on a regular basis in the fictional Rio Piedras--SIX IN ONE WEEK, she recounts early in the story.  There was little to help me take an interest in the story of Viola.  She is weak and boring and flat.<br /><br />And the details of Donovan's character and motivation are not clearly culled one from the other.  It is unclear why we are to love this 'dom' and be interested in what happens to him.<br /><br />The characters are just not compelling.  They do not stick with you, make you see them in your mind, relate to them with affection, anger...or any emotion really at all.<br /><br />The Irish Devil is just not very deep, intelligent, thought-provoking or stimulating.  I do not even feel that the author gave me a very good history lesson--painting me a picture of the period and culture.  And though this is less important even to a lover of romantica such as myself, the love scenes were not even hot.

US	28741093	R3ODGO5NHTCD0V	0451206371	723363546	Rosamund	Books	1	24	31	N	Y	Garbage	I have to say that this is my second and hopefully LAST Bertrice Small novel.  I feel as if I was tricked into buying this book, because the first Small novel that I stumbled onto, Skye O'Malley, was so good that it mislead me into thinking that this author might be a treasure.  If Rosamund is anything to go by, then I was sorely mistaken.<br /><br />First, there it is impossible to believe that Rosamund would be as smart as she supposedly is at the age of six years old when we know that she could not even read the alphabet or spell her own name.  And yet she understands complicated social politics and what it means to be heiress of her own estate??  And getting a little ahead of myself, the hero apparent for the upcoming sequal FELL IN LOVE WITH A SIX YEAR OLD when he was the mature age (for those times) of sixteen years?  Disturbing.<br /><br />And then the love interests....  I don't even know where to begin!  For all intents and purposes Sir Owein Meredith should have been all that Rosamund needed--a grown man, a knight, beautiful and blonde, sought after by all the women of the court.  And yet in her reminisence of the man, Rosamund recharacterizes the same as a dry, old bore.  I don't think Small knew what she wanted to do with the knight and what she wanted him to represent.  One minute he was an angel-haired, smooth knight and the next he was a weak old man with one foot out of the grave.  Small vascillated, never deciding whether we (and Rosamund) are to fall in-love with the man...or merely have a fondness for him.<br /><br />And the relationship between Rosamund and the prince, later King Henry was also difficult for me to swallow.  Again, here Small did not seem able to make up her mind whether her main character was a weak, malleable obsequious submissive or a strong, independent, self-possessed heiress.  The way she reacted to Henry's propositions, arrogance and bad behavior did not show any of the adroitness or diplomacy she supposedly had been born with and cultivated during her time at court.  And more importantly, my high regard of Rosamund suffered as her actions increasingly showed a lack of basic integrity and the goodness Small endeavored to encourage us to believe she possessed.<br /><br />And the ending...the ending....  Well, all I can say is that while Small's imagination must have been bursting with possible love interests for Rosamund, I think that the quality of romance, erotica, plot and character connection in each relationship should be paid more heed than to the quantity of characters.  More specifically, while the Scot thrown into the mix and maintaining a position in the background of the story may have been compelling, it was vasty unsatisfying to have him waiting in the wings and then so haphazardly forced into the limelight toward the end and during the epilogue.<br /><br />For Shame, Miss Small!born with and cultivated during her time at court.
