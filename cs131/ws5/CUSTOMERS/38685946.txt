With this book, Johnson traces the origins of the US Empire, first as a by-and-large economic empire (via the World Bank and WTO), and now as a military empire, under neoconservative leadership. Scarier than the neoconservative agenda, though, has been the bipartisan acceptance of a growing, secretive military-industrial complex (MIC), with it's \\"black budgets\\" and lack of accountability and public oversight. Johnson traces the history of the MIC all the way to the present, showing how it expanded in the post-cold-war era to become a de facto \\"empire of bases\\", ruling the world through unilateral gunboat diplomacy. For those Americans who have enjoyed the benefits of global economic and military hegemony, life seemed good until 9-11. Now, it seems rather insecure, to say the least. And, according to Johnson, the road ahead is only going to get bumpier, as our foreign policy increases global insecurity, both social and economic, as well as the threat of terrorism. The argument Johnson weaves together is highly cogent and well-researched. Most remarkable for a book of such leaning, he only utilizes the most rigorously conservative sources. A powerful, necessary read for anyone concerned about the fate of the nation. For further reading, I suggest A People's History of the U.S., by Howard Zinn.<br /><br />j.w.k.	2005-02-17

In effect, it is an anti-educational curriculum - and the root cause of many a national cris.<br /><br />The end result of this curriculum is a monoculture of mass-produced students, like so many cars off the assembly line, who lack imagination and display all but the most rudimentary critical-reasoning skills. Devoid of compassion, these children denegrate and ridicule each other, have difficulty expressing intimacy and candor, and exhibit the same crass materialism we see in society at large. Dependent, passive and timid in the face of challenges, these children are little more than fodder for the low-income service sector jobs that are so abundant in the United States.<br /><br />Contra this system of compulsory schooling, Gatto espouses a curriculum that fosters personality development and relates facts to the real world. He wants to end the \\"bells, insults, and standardized tests\\" by encouraging teachers and parents to co-learn with their children in a more humane, context-driven way. After reading this well-argued, highly persuasive book, I have come to believe that something like Gatto's humane, context-driven curriculum is the only way formalized schooling has any chance of success.<br /><br />If you are interested in doing further reading on the topic, I recommend PLACE-BASED EDUCATION, by Sobel, and GUERRILLA LEARNING by Llewellyn and Silver. Another fascinating read is POWER AND PLACE: INDIAN EDUCATION IN AMERICA, by acclaimed Native American philosopher Vine Deloria Jr. and Daniel Wildcat.<br /><br />To end with a quote from the book: \\"Well-schooled people are irrelevant. They can sell film and razor blades, push paper and talk on telephones, or sit mindlessly before a flickering computer terminal, but as human being they are useless.\\"<br /><br />j.w.k.ook: \\"Well-schooled people are irrelevant.

Hers is a voice confronting the powers of empire.<br /><br />With the accuracy of someone weilding linguistic pruning shears, Roy deftly shreds our most sacred doctrines. \\"Flags\\", she reminds us, are nothing more than \\"bits of coloured cloth that governments use first to shrink-wrap people's minds and then as ceremonial shrouds to bury the dead.\\" They are the symbols of our government's imperialist ambitions.<br /><br />'Freedom' is the mask government wears to \\"murder, annihilate, and dominate other people.\\" It is the freedom \\"to finance and sponsor despots and dictators across the world. The freedom to train, arm, and shelter terrorists. The freedom to topple democratically elected governments. The freedom to amass and use weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological, and nuclear. The freedom to go to war against any country whose governments it disagrees with. And, most terrible of all, the freedom to commit these crimes against humanity in the name of 'justice', in the name of 'righteousness', in the name of 'freedom'.\\"<br /><br />Another word Roy takes issue with is 'Liberal Democracy' - a word the US government and its corporate cohorts have twisted, besmirched and spread over the world like an incurable STD. Liberal Democracy is simply a codeword for the type of imperialist market the US foists upon the world. It is a product  we in the US sell to other countries, like Iraq, whether they want it or not, and death \\"is a small price...to pay for the privilege of sampling this new product: Instant-Mix Imperial Democracy (bring to a boil, add oil, then bomb).\\"<br /><br />\\"Meanwhile,\\" while we all sit around debating the fate of the biosphere, \\"down at the mall there's a mid-season sale. Everything's discounted - oceans, rivers, oil, gene pools, fig wasps, flowers, childhoods, aluminum, factories, phone companies, wisdom, wilderness, civil rights, ecosystems, air - all 4.6 billion years of evolution. It's packed, sealed, tagged, valued, and available off the rack (no returns). As for justice,\\" she says, \\"I'm told it's on offer too.\\"<br /><br />Roy also takes aim on the War on Terrorism - not for what it is, but for how it's conducted. \\"The underlying logic of the terrorist attacks, as well as 'retaliatory' wars against governments that 'support terrorism', is the same: both punish citizens for the actions of their governments.\\" Neither Bush nor Osama bin Laden can face this fact, though, which speaks to their overriding similarities: \\"They both hold people responsible for the actions of their governments. They both believe in the doctrine of collective guilt and collective punishment. Their actions benefit each other greatly.\\" Furthermore, they both converse with with a god who has sanctified their war against 'evil doers' - ie, each other.<br /><br />The only thing not for sale, it would seem, is Roy's voice. Of all her books, this is by far my favorite. And of all the great social critics - Naom Chomsky, Edward Said, Howard Zinn, Edward Herman, Amy Goodman, Michael Albert, Chalmers Johnson, William Blum, Anthony Arnove - she writes with the most urgency and passion.

Imagine a future where every motion, thought, and act is recorded, analyzed and incorporated into a system of Absolute Control. As Jensen and Draffan show in this book, such a future is rapidly approaching. In fact, it is almost here.<br /><br />A few up-coming technologies discussed in this book include: Radio frequency tags (RFID) that have the power to number, identify, catalog and track every item in the world; mind-reading machines; thought implantation, using a beam of sound transmitted from hundreds of yards away so focused that only one person can hear it; ubersoldiers that can leap buildings, deflect bullets with hard exoskeletons and even become invisible; remote-controlled animals; vehicle tracking systems; nanotechnologies that can target and destroy a specific group of people; pills for everything - including the suppression of pesky emotions, like fear and remorse; the e-man and uploading the human brain; smart dust; Domestic Control Hover Drones: silent, remote controlled drones capable of chasing people at fifty miles per hour, equipped with video cameras, thermal imaging sensors, microphones which can pick up a conversation at more than a quarter mile, voice transmitters (\\"Stop, this is the police!\\") and a stun-gun.<br /><br />Frightened yet? No worries. \\"So long as you do what they tell us, we have nothing to hide, and nothing to fear.\\" Right? Along with the authors, I am not so sure about that. The oppressive technologies Jensen and Draffan discuss in this book are downright terrifying. Yet it is really terrifying to know that our government is developing much scarier things behind closed doors. Those technologies we know about are the ones that are supposed to wow us over. However, for me personally, there is nothing awe-inspiring about the prospect of having my thoughts read, hearing Big Brother's voice in my ear, being chased by hover drones, or digitally chipped with an RFID tag. There is nothing inspiring about living inside Bentham's Panopticon. No, so long as we do what they tell us, we have everything to fear.<br /><br />Yet long before we allow ourselves to be ruled by outward machines, we must submit to the fundamentalist machine religions of Christianity, Science, Capitalism, Bureaucracy and Progress. These institutions obliterate diversity by coercing us into distrusting our own direct experience and defer to experts. The mantras of futility should sound familiar: outside science there is no knowledge; outside technology there is no comfort; outside capitalism there are no economic transactions; outside industrial civilization there is no humanity, and outside the Panopticon there is no security. Outside the system, nothing is imaginable.<br /><br />Running concomitant with the progress of science and technology is the disempowerment of people, our increasing separation from nature and the exponential growth of social chaos. As history advances, we are increasingly individualized, stripped naked under the gaze of a cold, abstract power. As bureaucracy and its rules of efficiency, quantification and redundancy expand, we experience the death of creativity, spontaneity and hope. Progress becomes a sort of downward spiral, in which every emotion \\"except pain, rage, triumph, and self-abasement\\" are eradicated, to borrow from Orwell. \\"Everything else we will destroy - everything.\\"<br /><br />Aside from the great pyramids of technology and power, there really isn't much left to destroy in the natural world. We have already laid waste to the earth: We have initiated the greatest extinction in 65 million years, the primeval forests have been largely leveled, the climate has been irrevocably altered, and all of the air, food and water we need to live as organic beings has been laced with deadly pollutants. Really, what's left? What is worth saving in this system of destruction?<br /><br />What the panoptic guards do not want you to know is that there is another way to live. Indeed, there are many other ways. Thousands of tribal cultures succeeded (and the ones that are left are still succeeding, insofar we let them) in living harmoniously in the natural world. As the authors note, these cultures were based on gift giving and the maintenance of close, face-to-face relationships that encourage egalitarianism. Our culture, on the other hand, the culture of the machine, is based upon economic relationships characterized by buying and selling. Lawyers and shopkeepers are the primary mediators.<br /><br />How do we leave the panopticon? What's the exit strategy? \\"All it will take for this whole rotten system to collapse is for enough of us to learn to say NO. And to say NO again. And again. And again.\\" Say no to your destructive job, and do something positive. Say no to the global economy, and start living locally. Say no to politics, and stage a revolution. Say no to your car, and walk for a change. Say no to oppression, and exit the machine.<br /><br />JWKimate has been irrevocably altered, and all of the air, food and water we need to live as organic beings has been laced with deadly pollutants.

We are razing the forests, causing mass extinctions, and have befouled earth, sky and water with with deadly toxins. While clinging to faith in science and progress, deserts quietly creep in on our venerated civilization. Within the human economy (community sounds too hospitable) as well, we see signs of collapse: some \\"800 million people go to bed hungry every night; and in wealthy industrialized nations, chronic unemployment, violence, social alienation, drug abuse, crime, unhappiness and the disparity between rich and poor appear to be rising. The sense that something is wrong is pervasive... People seem to feel helpless and pessimistic about the future.\\" All of this, it must be added, in an era that many historians and pundits tout for \\"unprecedented scientific and technological progress.\\" Suzuki believes that, although abundant with information and technique, we lack a working worldview and have utterly disconnected ourselves from the living planet. \\"What we need,\\" he says, \\"is a new kind of science that approaches the traditional knowledge of indigenous communities.\\" What we need is a new story, sense of place, deep connection and meaning - and that's exactly what this book provides. Suzuki's life-affirming narrative explains who we are, where we came from, and our proper place is in this complex, interdependent world. A beautiful blend of ancient wisdom and modern scientific thought, The Sacred Balance provides nothing less than the complete picture.<br /><br />A MUST READ<br /><br />j.w.k.	2004-10-01

But that is exactly what one would expect from the multi-headed hydra of Development: horrible construction projects fronted by big business swindlers who have little interest in improving quality of life for the public or protecting important places.<br /><br />That said, the book is much more than a critique of Glen Canyon Dam. It speaks more broadly about how the bulk of our lives are spent mindlessly serving the interests of economic development at the expense of the places and communities we love, our own health and common sense. It also chronicles the absurdity of a society which values property above human life.<br /><br />You don't have to be a \\"Green\\" to appreciate this book; you simply have to enjoy life on this misty green ball. Abbey is the voice of the land, and a particularly American voice at that. Moreover, he is just a really good writer. The character development is so good that, despite everything, you will find yourself enwrapped and identifying with his off-the-wall characters.<br /><br />Just to give you a dam update... Now been 36 years afer its initial construction, there has been a call to drain Lake Powell, tear down the dam, and let the Colorado flow free again. However, this won't happen if the house-boaters, jet-skier, and energy barons of the dam business have there way. It was in the hope of seeing this lake run wild again that Abbey wrote The Monkey Wrench Gang. I hope the book is as politically inspiring as it is fun to read.<br /><br />j.w.k.	2004-10-01

The upshot of this evolutionary odyssey is clear: agriculture has never had anything to do with nutrition, culinary flavor or food security. On the contrary, it has had everything to do with the commodification of food and the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a small minority. Readable, quotable, and packed with information, this books is sure to please everyone - unless you are an unforgiving vegetarian. For Manning is clearly a hunter, or perhaps hunter-gatherer is a better term. As he says, \\"Food is about a great deal more than nutrition. It, along with sex, forms the pathway that connects our species to the future.\\" Yet again: \\"We must hunt for food and sex. This is our obsession, our drive, the focus of our senses and our sensuality, so ingrained as to define our humanity. These drives are our essence.\\" And yet, Manning does not suggest, or even believe it is possible, to revert to the lifestyle of our by-and-large neurosis-free hunger-gatherer forebears. We have already colonized too much of the planet to support our growing population; so how could six billion people survive as foraging hunters? The solution, as he and I both see it, is \\"something approaching permaculture\\" - that is, a perennial polyculture based on local production and consumption. Manning also praises the Slow Food Movement and farmers markets. All together a remarkable book.<br />Some related readings include:  \\"Coming Home to Eat\\" by Gary Nabham and \\"The Food Revolution\\" by John Robbins on the subject of food. For great discussions on agriculture, see \\"The Fatal Harvest Reader\\" by Andrew Kimbrell and \\"A Green History of the World\\" by Clive Ponting.

Skyrocketing human populations put enormous pressure on the productive and absorptive capacities of Earth, outstripping her carrying capacity by some twenty percent. As ever more fisheries collapse, forests shrink, rangelands deteriorate, soils erode, species vanish, temperatures rise, rivers run dry, water tables fall, ozone fades and polar ice caps melt, the single most important question humanity has faced resonates ever louder: How can we live sustainably? Rather than naively banking on some techno-fix, Art believes that we must learn about earth systems in order to live in accord with those systems. In other words, he believes humanity must become ecologically literate.<br /><br />Written for \\"earthlings ages 12 to 120,\\" Art's Guide is at once light enough for youth to comprehend and yet comprehensive enough for adults. By breaking the subject down into three primary categories (matter systems, energy systems and life systems) he provides a simple framework for thinking about Earth's systems within systems within systems within...you guessed it, more systems! Similarly, he explains the synergistic aspects of these systems, their deep interconnections and the complex feedback loops which work to balance or reinforce patterns of change: like the rising temp>CO2>greenhouse effect>rising temp feedback loop, commonly known as global warming.<br /><br />While elucidating these earth systems, Art stresses our deep interconnection with them. \\"Now, fill a glass with water,\\" he says. \\"This glass that you hold in your hand today has more than ten million water molecules that once passed through the body of the buffalo, more than ten million water molecules that passed through the dinosaur and more than ten million water molecules that passed through one of our African ancestors!\\" Along with many other passages throughout the book, the above passage shuns one the most pernicious dualisms in Western thought: namely, that humanity is somehow separate from the natural world.<br /><br />To keep things in perspective, Art includes a comprehensive discussion of current environmental issues: including habitat fragmentation, habitat destruction, pollution, excessive harvesting, introduction of exotic species and climate change. He also notes the major changes we must institute in order to prevent and mitigate further harm, from purchasing organic produce to selecting a home to limiting our consumption of red meat. Why red meat, you ask? I'll let Art answer that one.<br /><br />Part and parcel of this discussion is the typical corporation. As usual, Art takes a systems approach here. The traditional company inefficiently utilizes solar energy in the form of fossil fuels, minerals and biomass in order to produce finished goods. Processing these finished goods usually creates pollution and waste, much of it toxic. The company then sells the finished product (which is in many cases inefficient, highly-polluting and toxic itself) to willing if uninformed consumers. The consumer then uses the finished product and disposes of it, creating even more waste and introducing more pollutants into the biosphere. Thus, the modern corporation is wasteful, inefficient and ecological devastating.<br /><br />Art wants to close these waste loops. A sustainable company would utilize solar energy and renewable materials in an eco-efficient, non-toxic manner, thereby completely avoiding problems of pollution and waste. After selling or renting those products and services to the public, the company would then recycle all the materials back into the production of new eco-efficient products or safely reintroduce it the biosphere. In effect, a sustainable company would create zero waste. What a concept!<br /><br />From energy budgets to carbon cycles to the greenhouse effect, Art does not leave a stone unturned. The perfect educational tool, Art's Guide has the potential to help create a sustainable future, grounded upon a citizenry with enough environmental understanding to live harmoniously within the delicate web of life upon which we feed and are ultimately fed upon.

It was the year humans claimed the entire sustainable yield of Earth.\\" Since that time, the stakes have only risen. Humanity now gobbles up some 20 percent more than of the earth's bioproductivity. \\"Why, then, hasn't the system begun to collapse?\\" you ask.<br /><br />The short answer is that it is, although the word collapse is a bit misleading. Over the last century, wars have claimed 175 million lives; and most, if not all, of those wars were fought to eliminate other humans, gain control land and resources, or maintain geopolitical and economic security. A third of the world's children suffer from malnutrition, of which tens of thousands die everyday, while, in the same amount of time, an estimated 100 to 1000 species vanish from the face of the planet. These are just a few symptoms of ecological collapse.<br /><br />In order to talk about sustainability, says Merkel, we have to talk about ecological footprints. Your ecological footprint is the amount of bioproductive land and sea area in continuous production to supply all you use and to absorb all you waste. Global sustainability, then, is a combined ecological footprint of humanity that does not tax earth faster than it can regenerate. When humanity takes from the earth faster than it can replenish, things breakdown: fisheries collapse, soils erode, species vanish, aquifers run dry, etc. - things you might read about on page A-14 of the newspaper everyday.<br /><br />\\"But how would I know if I am taking too much?\\" you ask. Ecological foot printing, says Merkel, is the best way to take the guesswork out of sustainability. \\"It allows us to measure our progress.\\" But then, what is progress? To some, paving over the entire world and covering it with skyscrapers, channeling every brook and stream to flow through culverts, and relying on large multinational corporations to synthesize our food from genetically-modified seeds sounds appealing, perhaps even sustainable. To others, sustainability entails reverting to something like the Stone Age and hunting in the forest with blunt instruments for wild game.<br /><br />Acknowledging a diversity of perspectives, Merkel merely asks us discover and then live according to our personal values. \\"What is your worldview?\\" he asks. The bottom line is that \\"there are 28.2 billion acres of bioproductive land on Earth - the total surface area minus the deep oceans, deserts, icecaps and built-up land. When divided between six billion people, each person gets a 4.7-acre share\\" - and no more. But this figure assumes humanity utilizes all of the earth for itself. So a better question would be, 'How much of my 4.7-acre share do I want to use for myself and how much do I want to leave for other life forms?'<br /><br />After quizzing you about your preferred tax on the planet, desired world population, and level of equity with other human and nonhuman inhabitants, he then shows you how many acres of land you can utilize while keeping in line with your values. This is your \\"sustainability goal.\\" For example, my desired sustainability goal was based on a two-child family and absolute equity among humans, leaving 90% of the earth as untouched wilderness, and leaving me personally with a mere 1.45794 acres. Radical simplicity, indeed! It looks like I'll have to ditch a kid or two.<br /><br />The point, which should not be lost in the math, is to gain an objective picture of our individual impact on the biosphere. Once we have that, we can start simplifying our life - and, as it turns out, living 'closer to the bone' is a lot more carefree and fun than, say, the daily corporate grind. Merkel himself is an example of this. Although he has managed to live on an budget of merely 5,000 dollars a year - to avoid supporting the military industrial complex via taxation - for the last 20 years, his life has been full of adventure,relaxation, and a certain joy de vivre many of us have never known.<br /><br />Along with the charts, mathematical formulas and statistics, this book is peppered with interesting anecdotes about those twenty years spent visiting indigenous cultures, biking foreign countries and backpacking in the woods. An amazing man, with a radical vision of environmental responsibility, Merkel is also living proof of just how enjoyable and fulfilling `simple living' can be.<br /><br />j.w.k.relaxation, and a certain joy de vivre many of us have never known.<br /><br />Along with the charts, mathematical formulas and statistics, this book is peppered with interesting anecdotes about those twenty years spent visiting indigenous cultures, biking foreign countries and backpacking in the woods.

Nevertheless, he is plagued by a sense of hollowness that cannot be quelled by conventional success. As with the legendary story Gotama Buddha (from which Hesse no doubt draws heavily), Siddhartha embarks on a journey of self-discovery that takes him through a period of asceticism and self-denial followed by one of near hedonistic sensual indulgence. However, neither asceticism, an encounter with Buddha, nor forays into love and business can satiate Siddhartha's quest for spiritual enlightenment. He continues the search, ultimately finding peace and enlightenment by a river, under the guidence of a humble ferryman. Although the narrative of Siddhartha's life parallels the legendary Buddha's in many ways, the form and content of Siddhartha's enlightenment are unique, differing greatly from that of the Buddha. Rather than merely extrapolating from the tenets of Buddhism, Hesse provides his own unique contribution to the living tradition - his own sutra, if you will - and the result is amazing. A profoundly important and beautiful little book that will fundamentally change you worldview for the better.<br />\\"He saw all these forms and faces in a thousand relationships to each other, all helping each other, loving, hating, destroying each other and become newly born. Each one of them was mortal, a passionate, painful example of all that was transitory. Yet none of them died, they only changed, were always reborn, continually had a new face: only time stood between one face and another.\\"	2004-03-17

When Corporations Rule is not simply a litany of profligate corporate excess, though. Korten explains the dysfunctional logic of our system, outlines the horrendous consequences for community and environment, and provides clear, cogent plans of action to create real democracy and awaken culturally.<br />We always harangue socialism as an \\"extreme ideology,\\" but as Korten makes clear capitalism is also an extreme ideology. Socialism concentrates power in a centralized government, creating unsupportable social and environmental costs. Capitalism concentrates power in huge private institutions (the modern multinational corporation), which also have enormous social and environmental costs. Both advance the concentration of rights of ownership without limit, to the exclusion of the needs and rights of the many who own virtually nothing. And as Korten shows, the impoverished many are growing.<br />As of 1992, the richest 20 percent of the global population received as much as 82.7 percent of the total world income. The poorest 20 percent received 1.4 percent. These figures indicate growing economic inequality, which is has become even more pronounced in the last decade. In 1998, the world's top three billionaires totaled more assets than the combined GNP of all the least developing countries and their 600 million people. Of the world's 6 billion people, 2.8 - that is, nearly half - were living on less than 2 dollars a day. Some 1.2 billion of that half lived on less than a dollar a day.<br />Inside America - the global economic trendsetter - this growing inequality that we see between nations is mirrored in microcosm. In fact, inequality and hardship is even more exaggerated in the Land of the Free. The wealthiest 10 percent now own almost 90 percent of all business equity, 88.5 percent of all bonds, and 89.3 percent of all stocks. In 1999, the total compensation of U.S. corporate CEOs was 475 times the average production worker's pay; and 29 percent of all U.S. workers were in jobs paying poverty level wages, defined as an hourly wage too low to meet the needs of a family of four. Moreover, with each new mega-merger and corporate takeover, more capital, power and control are concentrated in these already mammoth institutions. What ever happened to the anti-trust laws?<br />These are just a few of the statistics sited in the book, but When Corporations Rule offers more than statistical analysis. With laser precision, Korten essays economic and political history, uncovering the reasons for these global trends: including the illusion of growth, the loss of governmental oversight in the affairs of corporations, the rise of the Newtonian mechanical worldview and its subsequent devaluation of spiritual values, etc. His critique of globalization is absolutely stunning: including the effects of NAFTA, and the general policies of the WTO, the WB and the IMF. Finally, his call for localism, activism, spiritualism and an ecological awakening are inspiring and timely.<br />Not a stone goes uncovered. The failure of development strategies for the Third World (his stated specialty), critical discussion of traditional economic theory, the rise of PR, global poverty, currency speculation and corporate raiding, downsizing, contracting labor, automating, the loss of the small farm, the effects of Walmart and the like, ecological collapse, the coming Ecological Revolution, sustainability, socially responsible investment, systems theory, urban design, history of the current globalization protest movement, a detailed agenda for democratic change - these and so many other important issues are weaved together in a remarkable argument that will shock, sober and move you.

Our skyrocketing population puts enormous pressure on the productive and absorptive capacities of the land, outstripping the natural carrying capacity of the planet by some twenty percent. As ever more fisheries collapse, forests shrink, rangelands deteriorate, soils erode, species vanish, temperatures rise, rivers run dry, water tables fall, ozone depletion expands and polar ice caps melt across the globe, the single most important question humanity has faced resonates ever louder: How can we live sustainably?<br /><br />Orr argues that the ecological crisis is not technological problem that we can fix with some new-fangled gadgetry or updated economic models. Rather, the \\"disordering of ecological systems and the great biogeochemical cycles of the earth reflects a prior disorder in the thought, perception, imagination, intellectual priorities, and loyalties inherent in the industrial mind.\\" In other words, ecological crisis is a crisis of education. And yet, as Orr makes so clear, \\"we continue to educate the young for the most part as if there were no planetary emergency.\\"<br /><br />The effects of our educational system are not only bad for the planet, according to Orr, but bad for us as well. Contemporary \\"education...alienates us from life in the name of human domination, fragments instead of unifies, overemphasizes success and careers, separates feeling from intellect and the practical from the theoretical, and unleashes on the world minds ignorant of their ignorance.\\" In effect, we educate a society to get straight As and fail Life.<br /><br />Rather than educating for upward mobility, globally competitive economic success or increased technological cleverness, Orr recommends that we need educate for \\"ecological design intelligence\\" in an effort to foster \\"healthy, durable, resilient, just, and prosperous communities.\\" \\"The world does not need more rootless symbolic analysts,\\" says Orr. \\"It needs instead hundreds of thousands of young people equipped with the vision, moral stamina, and intellectual depth necessary to rebuild neighborhoods, towns, and communities around the planet. The kind of education presently available will not help them much. They will need to be students of their places and competent to become, in Wes Jackson's words, \\"native to their places.'\\"<br /><br />What would a sane, place-centered economy look like? \\"A sane civilization,\\" says Orr, \\"would have more parks and fewer shopping malls; more small farms and fewer agribusinesses; more prosperous small towns and smaller cities; more solar collectors and fewer strip mines; more bicycle trials and fewer freeways; more trains and fewer cars; more celebration and less hurry; more property owners and fewer millionaires and billionaires; more readers and fewer television watchers; more shopkeepers and fewer multinational corporations; more teachers and fewer lawyers; more wilderness and fewer landfills; more wild animals and fewer pets.\\" A sane civilaiton would not advocate unending economic growth at the expense of all planetary life. \\"Utopia?\\" he asks. \\"No! In our present circumstances it is the only realistic course imaginable. We have tried utopia and can no longer afford it.\\"<br /><br />Rather than offering utopian idealism, Orr sticks closely to the stark environmental consequence of our industrial society, the failures of our philosophical heritage, and the ecological crisis our educational system spawns, offering practical advice for change at every stage of the argument. From educating out-of-doors to redesigning schools to rehabilitating local habitats, Orr's educational vision is radical and necessary. Without implementing his pedagogical advice, one cannot expect things to get better.<br /><br />Without a doubt THE BEST work on education I have ever read, yet one need not have any interest in education to appreciate the import of Orr's thesis.

Derrick Jensen is the critically acclaimed author of a number of books: including Strangely Like War; Walking on Water; The Culture of Make Believe; A Language Older than Words; Listening to the Land: Conversations about Nature, Culture, and Eros; and co-author of Railroads and Clearcuts. Among environmentalists and social critics, there are none more vocal and unabashedly critical of global industrial society and its impact upon the biosphere AND our own psyches.

I recommend starting with A Language Older Than Words.<br />This CD compelation is perfect for those have not yet had the pleasure of hearing Jensen speak in person.

As is also true for most people I know, I always hated school. Why is that?\\" Although I cannot presume to speak for others, this was certainly true for me. School sucked. It was like torture, five days a week, eight hours a day, seemingly without beginning or end. And yet the end does eventually come, with much cap-throwing and fanfare, only to be crushed with the prospects of our work-a-day world and the ecological destruction it enacts on a daily basis.<br /><br />Along with Jensen, I would have to agree that one of the primary reasons we put up with this system is because we have been trained to do so, both bodily and mentally. \\"Throughout our adult lives, most of us are expected to get to work on time, to do our boss's bidding...and not to leave till the final bell has rung. It is expected that we will watch the clock, counting seconds till five o'clock, till Friday, till payday, till retirement, when at last our time will again be our own, as it was before we began kindergarten, or preschool, or daycare. Where do we learn to do all of this waiting?\\" The answer, of course, is school. School is the \\"day-prison\\" where we learn to be \\"a nation of slaves\\" - and servile slaves at that.<br /><br />To some, these statements might seem too extreme. To be sure, many of us enjoyed moments of school here and there, encountered truly inspiring teachers, and experienced enthusiasm and genuine learning amid the 18-year prison sentence we call formal education. But such is not the norm, nor is it the point. The point is rather to ask what education could be. \\"What are the effects of schooling on creativity?\\" Jensen asks. \\"How well does schooling foster the uniqueness of each child who passes through? Does schooling make children happier? For that matter, does our culture as a whole engender happy children? What does each new child receive in exchange for the so many hours for years on end that she or he gives to the school system?\\" The answer is not much, unless you consider obedience to the clock a high and noble aim. In light of the looming problems our society now faces - drug addiction, teen suicide, domestic violence, rampant materialism, ecological crisis - this systemic acculturation of obedience has become pathological. Yet as Jensen shows, the aim of education from the very start has been economic growth, homogenization, social control, and industrialization - not personal enrichment, individuality, creativity or even the creation of healthy communities.<br /><br />Through a complex web of stories, anecdotes and personal experiences teaching both literal prisoners at California State Pen and figurative prisoners at Eastern Washington University, Jensen offers an alternative vision of education. This vision is reoriented to educe, draw out, and lead forth the native impulses and interests of students and teachers alike; and  is predicated on our ability to listen to and follow our own hearts. As he says, \\"We need simply to be encouraged, to be given heart, to be allowed to grow our own large hearts. We do not need to be governed by external schedules - by the ticking of the ubiquitous classroom clock - nor told what and when we need to learn, nor what we need to express, but instead we need to be given time, not as a constraint, but as a gift in a supportive place where we can explore what we want and who we are, with the assistance of others who care about us also. This is true not only for me and for my students, but for all of us, including our nonhuman neighbors.\\"<br /><br />As with most of Jensen's previous works (Listening to the Land, A Language Older Than Words, and The Culture of Make Believe) Walking On Water is difficult to categorize. Despite the subtitle - Reading, Writing and Revolution - Jensen does not address any of these subjects specifically. Rather, he moves in and out of them while addressing the larger issue - which is how to be fully human, and how to allow others to be fully human, in an extremely dehumanizing world.

We have built a culture on the mistaken assumption that human beings are independent of one another and of the places and systems of the earth.&quot; To borrow from author Derrick Jensen, we are a culture of make believe; and the end result of the lies we tell ourselves and our children is economic and cultural alienation en mass. But Moore is not content with this revelation. She goes on to discuss several other &quot;lies that isolate us&quot; (the false dichotomies of today/tomorrow, near/far, us/them, and humans/nature) and then outlines the process of grief, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance of our ecological predicament. It is a very sobering essay that seeks &quot;creative acts of commitment--acts of imagining and choosing.&quot; It is an essay about &quot;caring for people and caring for places, (accepting) the challenge of reconciliation, bringing together what has been apart for a very long time.&quot;<br />The second essay, &quot;A Conservationist's Manifesto,&quot; is just that--a rich, stirring document about humanity's relationship with nature. Having begun as a lively talk between members of the Century for Land and People, it encapsulates the insight and wisdom of many individuals, including such environmental luminaries as William Cronon and Bill McKibben. Point 22 reads: &quot;In order to live, we must use the earth--but we should not use it up. For the sake of our descendants, we must learn to grow food without depleting the soil, fish without exhausting the seas, draw energy from sunlight and wind and tides. We must conserve the minerals we mine and the products we manufacture, recycling them as thoroughly as the forest recycles twigs, leaves, fur, and bone.&quot; All together, it is truly inspiring document, promoting a mature and ethical relationship between humans and the environment; and would make for a wonderful educational tool.<br />The third essay, &quot;Lifting the Veil&quot; by Peter Forbes, is actually six essays in one, and by far the longest and most eclectic of the bunch. Weaving in and out of such topics as time capsules, domestication, and the biographies of great people (Aldo Leopold, Scott and Helen Nearing, Thoreau, and Rachel Carson), Forbes articulates a new vision of conservationism. Differing from the old view, which simply seeks to preserve places, Forbes' vision seeks deep and lasting social change. Ever conscious of how it might end in less funding and social marginalization, he keeps his radical roots. In his words, &quot;As much as conservation is succeeding in creating refugia, or safe havens for pockets of diverse life that might survive the industrial growth society, we conservationists are failing to take the risks necessary to help people life differently, to envision and create an alternative culture. The alternative culture won't emerge solely because land has been protected, but only when our relationship, connection, and communion with that land have been restored.&quot;<br />Altogether, this book is about &quot;protecting the places that we have a birthright to, (helping) us find our roots or put down new roots, enabling us to envision the land as part of ourselves.&quot; Full of common sense, deep, earthly wisdom and a vision of what truly matters, COMING TO LAND contains the germ of an ecologically sustainable future.orest recycles twigs, leaves, fur, and bone.&quot; All together, it is truly inspiring document, promoting a mature and ethical relationship between humans and the environment; and would make for a wonderful educational tool. <br />The third essay, &quot;Lifting the Veil&quot; by Peter Forbes, is actually six essays in one, and by far the longest and most eclectic of the bunch.

The alternative culture won't emerge solely because land has been protected, but only when our relationship, connection, and communion with that land have been restored.&quot; <br />Altogether, this book is about &quot;protecting the places that we have a birthright to, (helping) us find our roots or put down new roots, enabling us to envision the land as part of ourselves.&quot; Full of common sense, deep, earthly wisdom and a vision of what truly matters, COMING TO LAND contains the germ of an ecologically sustainable future.	2004-03-02

Born in the mid-seventies, permaculture co-founder Bill Mollison defines this new field as \\"the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems. It is the harmonious integration of landscape and people providing their food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way. Without permaculture there is no possibility of a stable social order.\\" In other words, permaculture is the practical science of sustainability - a whole-systems approach life in the biosphere - and this near-encyclopedic tome covers every aspect of the subject, from soil conditions to climactic factors. The only conceivable drawback of this book is that it is rather difficult to ascertain and won't come cheap. If you enjoy tracking down rare and expensive books, there are none better than Mollison's Permaculture: A Designer's Manual. Large, comprehensive and filled with helpful illustrations and explanations, it is nothing less than the permaculture bible. On the other hand, if you are on a tight budget, and do not wish to spend your time searching for an unworn copy, there are newer and more accessible titles on the subject: like the other permaculture co-founder David Holmgren's Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability, or the concise and slim Earth User's Guide to Permaculture, by Rosemary Morrow. Whatever book you choose, this fascinating subject is perhaps humanity's only hope for a sustainable (read livable) future. Should not be overlooked.<br /><br />An essential reference.<br /><br />j.w.k.	2004-01-30

Our skyrocketing population puts enormous pressure on the productive and absorptive capacities of the land, outstripping the natural carrying capacity of the planet by some twenty percent (see Radical Simplicity, by Jim Merkel). In effect, we are stealing away the life of the planet and the life of future generations. As ever more fisheries collapse, forests shrink, rangelands deteriorate, soils erode, species vanish, temperatures rise, rivers run dry, water tables fall, ozone depletion expands and polar ice caps melt across the globe, the single most important question humanity has faced resonates ever louder:  How can we live sustainably?<br /><br />Amid the cacophony of scholarly and political debate surrounding this issue, the hushed emergence of permaculture has by and large gone unnoticed. Defined as the use of systems thinking and design principles to consciously design \\"landscapes which mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, while yielding an abundance of food, fibre and energy for provision of local needs,\\" the permaculture concept is nothing less than the science of sustainability. And since the joint publication of Permaculture One: A Perennial Agricultural System for Human Settlements (now out of print) by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in the mid-seventies, permaculture has become a veritable movement - a legitimate answer to the environmental and agricultural crises which plague humanity. Unfortunately, for the past twenty-five years, those who wished to learn more about permaculture were limited to joining expensive seminars and workshops, thereby ensuring marginal public exposure. All of this has changed, though, with the publication of this book. Holmgren provides us with a no-nonsense guide to permaculture, accessible to laypersons and scholars alike.<br /><br />If you are interested in moving away from consumer dependency and becoming a responsible productive person, this book is for you. The skills and ideas imparted here are not only necessary for those who seek to create a healthful, sustainable way of life, they are empowering. In my opinion, permaculture is the best tool we have with which to begin creating a viable, perhaps more-than-merely-sustainable future.<br /><br />To get an idea of what permaculture actually looks like on the ground, check out Ecovillage Living, by Hildur Jackson and Karen Svensson, and visit the Crystal Waters Permaculture Village website.<br /><br />A remarkable resource.<br /><br />j.w.k.k is for you.

This year, the format has changed a little. Instead of providing the usual litany of statistics outlining the global eco-crisis (fisheries collapsing, forests shrinking, rangelands deteriorating, soils eroding, species obliterated, temperatures rising, rivers running dry, water tables falling, ozone depletion expanding, more destructive storms brewing, polar ice caps melting, sea level rising, etc.), the focus is consumption - which makes sense, because if are reading this, you are more than likely a consumer, and if you are a consumer, you are a fundamental part of the problem. As usual, the scholarship is excellent. Unfortunately, it lacks serious discussion of alternatives for individuals seeking to do more than reduce, reuse, recycle and support green energy initiatives. In other words, as with all State of the World reports, it is only useful as a scholarly reference - or, to put it another way, not very useful. If you have already come to believe there is in fact a fundamental problem with the way industrial civilization works, I would recommend one of four books, depending on your outlook: (1) WHAT GOES UP, by Derrick Jensen (due for release sometime in 2005) (2) PERMACUTLURE: Principles & Pathways Beyond Sustainability, by David Holmgren (3) RADICAL SIMPLICITY: Small Footprints on a Finite Planet or (4) ECOVILLAGE LIVING: Restoring the Earth and Her People, by Hildur Jackson Karen Svensson. The first book, which will no doubt be as insightful and transformative as Jensen's earlier works, addresses the issue of bringing down civilization. The second book utilizes system's theory and design science in an effort empower ordinary people to create their own permanent and sustainable communities. The third book, rather consumer-oriented and reformist in nature, offers radical advice on reducing your ecological footprint. The fourth book profiles various ecovillages all over the world and provides lots of practical advice for people seeking to join or start their own. If you are like me, you will no doubt read them all - and then some - but if you are just looking for a global eco-almanac on consumer trends, the State of the World 2004 will do.

Already well-versed in this subject, authors Draffan and Jensen have provided us with a sobering expose of global deforestation, the political corruption that aids and abets it, and a stirring portrait of various indigenous peoples who have suffered (and still suffer) genocide as a result. Arguing from a position outside strict environmentalism, Strangely Like War levels a broader critique of globalization: &quot;this parasitic, monetized, commodity-driven, inequitable, monocultural socioeconomic system&quot;, sometimes referred to simply as Western Civilization (altho geography no longer has anything to do with it). Along side everything else Jensen has every written, this book is a soulfully critical masterpiece that should not be overlooked.<br />A MUST READ	2003-12-28

It is a profound work that should be read by everyone living inside Western Civilization. However the book does not not come without a few problems. For starters, Liedloff fails to make clear the debt she owes to the Yequana Indians from whom she gleaned the \\"continuum concept.\\" To recognize this debt, the book might better have been titled \\"The Yequana Concept.\\"<br />Similarly, the original intent and purpose of Liedloff's foray into the South American rainforest is horribly suspect. She went there to discover and plunder diamonds. This is not to discount the knowledge and wisdom she gleaned from the Yequana, but it does display Liedlof's ignorance concerning native land and resource rights, not to mention what possible affect diamond poachers like herself might have on local cultures. These issues never seemed to have entered her mind.<br />Finally, the actual content of the book itself is often repetitive and over-simplified. Having recognized that, unlike Westerners, Yequana are a happy, well-rounded, neurosis-free people, Liedloff asks why. Her answer, that all Yequana babies experience 24-hour in-arm care from their mothers, is insightful, but partial and lacking. Clearly, Westerns have a lot to learn from the Yequana about childcare, but I believe it takes a lot more than in-arms care to produce a happy, healthy society. The success of the Yequana does not hinge on one variable. To understand their success, we must look at the total culture and its environment.<br />Unlike Westerners, the Yequana still live within the bounds of and draw support from Mother Nature, via the surrounding rainforest. Westerners, on the other hand, grow up in concrete jungles, divorced from the living, biological world. Nor do Yequana have to endure the relentless nine-to-five, junk food, population pressure, or any of the other ills of modern civilization. Moreover, although Liedloff never mentions this, the Yequana are by no means unique. All indigenous cultures are sustainable and remarkably free of neurosis.<br />Before coming into contact with West, every indigenous tribe enjoyed high standards of health, wealth, happiness and security - standards which we so-called \\"civilized\\" people continually strive for but fail to achieve. If you are interested in learning more about non-Western cultures and their success, there are a number of authors I can recommend, such as John H. Bodley (Victims of Progress, Cultural Anthropology, Power of Scale, etc), Chellis Glendinng (My Name is Chellis), Daniel Quinn (Ishmael, the Story of B), and Robert Wolff (Original Wisdom).

It comprises an historical assay of Western Civilization and a political manifesto for all people who would choose to end the legacy of colonialism. An ancient nation that has existed in peace in prosperity without recourse to laws and jails, the Haudenosaunee were the first to establish a league of &quot;United Nations&quot; to ensure peace, harmony and respect among disparate groups of people. Incidentally, it was their pact, the Iroquois Confederacy, which inspired the government of the United States of America. Of particular notice in this collection was the last paper, &quot;A Basic Call to Consciousness,&quot; which succinctly outlines the original instructions given to the Haudenosaunee by the Creator of Life; the destructive processes which are eradicating their way of life and most life on the planet; and lastly the Haudenosaunee strategy for survival. Absolutely essential for anyone who wishes to better understand and change the oppressive, exploitive, and destructive traditions which drive Western Civilization, I cannot over recommend this book.	2003-12-10

For starters, nature runs on sunlight and creates no waste. To me, this alone is reason enough to mimic nature, since our profligate energy use has caused a global eco-crisis. Not only does the combustion of fossil fuels pollute the air breathe (leading to some 3 million deaths from air pollution annually according to the WHO), but it also floods the atmosphere with CO2, leading culprit in the greenhouse effect. Moreover, being that the supply of crude oil is finite, the very foundation of our economy will one day run dry. Nature, on the other hand, runs on the unlimited bounty of sunlight. Unlimited clean energy is just one example of the genius of nature which author Benyus points out in this book.<br />Nature does many other wonderful things we would do well to learn from. Arctic fish and frogs freeze solid and then spring to life, having protected their organs from ice damage. Black bears hibernate all winter without poisoning themselves on their urea, while their polar cousins stay active with a coat of transparent hollow hairs covering their skins like the panes of a greenhouse. Chameleons and cuttlefish hide without moving, changing the pattern of their skin to instantly blend with their surroundings. Bees, turtles, and birds navigate without maps, while whales and penguins dive without scuba gear. How do they do it? How do dragonflies outmaneuver our best helicopters? How do hummingbirds cross the Gulf of Mexico on less than one tenth of an ounce of fuel? How do ants carry the equivalent of hundreds of pounds in a dead heat through the jungle? How do muscles attach to rock in a wet environment? The answers to these questions may seem like trivia to non-expert, but \\"The difference between what life needs to do and what we need to do is another one of those boundaries that doesn't exist. Beyond mattes of scale, the differences dissolve.\\"<br />Like every other creature, humans cause a lot of commotion in the biosphere: creating, moving, and consuming. But our species is the only one that creates more waste than nature can safely and efficiently recycle. Ours is only one that ignores ecological limits, exceeds the carrying capacity of the land, and consumes more energy than nature can provide. The ideology that allowed us to expand beyond our limits was that the world -- never-ending in its bounty -- was put here exclusively for our use. But after the topsoil blows away, the oceans go lifeless, the oil wells go dry, and the air and water we depend on are utterly fouled, what will we do? Will we be able to survive? Unlike the impact of a car, is crisis is cumulative. The mounting effects of this ideology are rising temperatures, decreasing grain yields, rising cancer rates, falling fish harvests, dwindling forests, worsening air pollution, and rising oil and water prices. A most resilient creature, I believe we (or some of us) will survive this ecololgical \\"bottle-neck\\" squeeze, to use Harvard scientist E.O. Wilson's phrase. But the questions this book seeks to answer is, can we flourish?<br />As mentioned by other reviewers, some parts were overly technical. However, much of it is written with the layperson in mind. Moreover, the book is rich in philosophy, like that of Wes Jackson, Bill Mollison, Masanobu Fukuoka, and writers Thomas and Wendell Berry (unrelated). And the main point of the book is simple enough for a child to understand. Does it run on sunlight? Does it use only the energy it needs? Does it fit form to function? Does it recycle everything? Does it reward cooperation? Does it bank on diversity? Does it utilize local expertise? Does it curb excess from within? Does it tap the power of limits? And is it beautiful? In order to right our wasteful and dangerously dysfunctional relationship with nature, these ten questions should serve as guiding principles for design and human interaction.<br />Although some of the science is now dated (e.g., hydrogen fuel cells are now a reality), this book will remain pregnant with philosophical and practical insights for years to come. It is far, far ahead of the times. My only criticism is that, much of the scientific history and intrastructure this book depends on actually helped create the eco-predicament we currently find ourselves in. The labratories she visits (not to mention the cars she uses to visit them) are not exactly eco-friendly. In other words, the author supposes more technology and \\"progres\\" will eventually help us out of this predicament.<br />This book is a landmark - and one hell of a good read. Dssential for anyone interested business, philosophy, ecology, science or engineering. And when combined with other books, like Lester Brown's ECO-ECONOMY, David Korten's WHEN CORPORATIONS RULE THE WORLD, Paul Hawkins' NATURAL CAPITALSIM, Hildur Jackson and Karen Svensson's ECOVILLAGE LIVING, and perhaps something on eco-education, it would fit well into my dream eco-philosophy course. Unfortunately, I'm not a teacher and very few universities have funding for such programs anyway.erve as guiding principles for design and human interaction.<br />Although some of the science is now dated (e.g., hydrogen fuel cells are now a reality), this book will remain pregnant with philosophical and practical insights for years to come.

UPSIDE DOWN strives to illuminate the absurdities of our world: a world where the strong devour the weak, where corporations devastate the planet, and TV colonizes our souls. Written in the most penetrating and damning language, Galeano is not afraid to tell it like it is. In other words, this is not a feel-good book. For this reason, some have discredited it as a \\"diatribe,\\" without fully knowing the meaning, history or import of the word. Defined as \\"learned discourse\\" mixed with \\"bitter resentment,\\" UPSIDE DOWN is indeed a diatribe - but the most necessary, illuminating and effective diatriabe out there (with the possible except of Derrick Jenson's A LANGUAGE OLDER THAN WORDS and CULTURE OF MAKE BELIEVE). Similar to those books, UPSIDE DOWN is a scathing indictment of the injustices of modern life. But it is also a shrill, poetic cry for change. This book will unlock more than feelings remorse for the suffering, it will also unlock anger and infuse you with passion for change. All together, a strange little book of riddles, sardonic poems of dissent, mind-boggling statistics, perspective warps, linguistic twists, and poetic flares. Hooked from the first page, it blew me away. In the end, I must have commonplaced over a quarter of it. Another Galeano masterpiece.

And, really, who cares what a bunch of dead, white, bearded guys thought anyway? Well, forget acedemia and its recondite intellectuals. Philosophy was meant for the open air of the agora, and the cocophony of voices and opinions that come with it. Only there, amid the diversity and freshness of life, can we discover contemporary issues and depart on altogether new philosophical vistas. With this book, and the Socrates' Cafe movement in general, Phillips has done the seemingly impossible -- he brought philosophy back down to earth. He made the business of philosophy public. Like a roving Socrates, he has taken to the streets, nursing homes, middle schools, cafes and even the prisons of America -- all in search of the question -- and in his wake you will find a storm of discussion. The results are phenomenal. Socrates' Cafes are popping faster than Star Bucks! It would seem that everyone has a knack for this ancient art. Quick, easy and highly rewarding, this book is sure to ignite or rekindle your philosophical passions. It certainly did for me, anyway. Good for both beginning interlocutors and the most advanced philosophical heavyweights.	2003-10-03

If you are in any way interested in the debates surrounding democracy, ecology, sustainability, resource management, globalization, locatization, the environment, corportism, bio- and cultural-diversity, human rights, food security, job security, energy, transportion, manufacturing and the general measure of progress, this book is a must. I was particularly impressed with the way ALTERNATIVES was able to blend an argument for global regulations while at the same time stridently championing the rights of local, autonomous indigenous peoples. This is THE document for anyone interested in understanding globalization and its possible alternatives.	2003-10-01

Here in Native Pragmatism, professor Scott Pratt argues that pragmatism, that unique philosophical tradition which grew up in America, is no exception. In the introduction, he describes his project as follows: \\"I wish to present a different history of pragmatism that traces its origins along the border between Native and European America in a context significantly conditioned by Native American thought.\\" The result is a work that both enlarges and reconstructs the entire American philosophical tradition.<br />The word pragmatism usually evokes the names of three white men of European descent - specifically, Peirce, James and Dewey, the three classic pragmatists. Whereas past historians of philosophy have tended to over emphasize the white, European influences of these thinkers (which Pratt does not dispute), this book attempts to counter-balance the story with new, alternative, particularly female and non-European influences that arose from the borderland of Native and European cultures. Along with the traditional pragmatists, Pratt has widened the cast to include such figures as Lydia Maria Child, Colden Cadwallader, Alice Chipman (John's first wife), Roger Williams, Metacom, Miantonomi, Neolin, Sagoyewatha, and Teedyuscung among others. Weaving in and out of their stories, Pratt unearths a wealth of interactions and connections that have hitherto been overlooked. In effect, he takes us deeper into the lived experience that served to inspire and instruct American philosophy.<br />Whereas some reviewers have branded Pratt a revisionist and neo-colonialist, bent on offering a politically correct version of pragmatism, I see something entirely different. His story is inclusive, not exclusive, and the people he unearths in his study were in fact talking, thinking and engaging the world in a very philosophical - if not pragmatic - way; and the subtle influences of their thought, like ripples echoing out across the surface of a pond, affected the entire cultural fabric. The extent of this influence may never fully be understood, but by tracing these philosophical ripples, Pratt has widened and deepened the history of pragmatism enough to make any single origin claim ridiculous. Clearly, the roots of American philosophy are rich, varied, and not strictly male or European - as was hitherto believed.<br />Although it is impossible to lump Native Americans or Euroamericans into one rigid category that defies exception, Pratt deftly sketches the similarities and differences between these two groups. On one side, we find a male-dominated \\"colonial attitude,\\" which orders events a hierarchically unified, linear timeline, giving preference to those things that are closer to the present. This colonial attitude is also resolutely opposed to cultural and religious difference. In effect, it offers outsiders two choices: assimilation or death. On the other side is the \\"indigenous attitude,\\" an attitude at once intimately connected with the land and open to cultural and religious differences. Indeed, as Pratt shows in his discussion of native cannibal stories and 'wunnigen' (or welcome), the leading indigenous strategies for dealing with difference were open-armed hospitality and generous welcome (even when that difference is withered cannibal approaching your village). It was only after these traditionally diplomatic strategies failed that Native Americans took up arms against invading colonialists as a last resort - in marked contrast to the historically violent tendencies of Euroamerican colonialists. Moreover, to confound and defy the very categories he employs, Pratt offers examples of when these two worldviews bled together and transformed each other through cross-cultural interaction. In other words, this is not a simple study, whichlumps white people into one group and native people into other. Rather, Pratt sets out specifically to reveal the deeper complexities implicit in cross-culture interaction.<br />Native Pragmatism is filled with detail and interpretation of the philosophical responses that sprung up at the border between two worlds - the white, colonial world and the red, indigenous world. It is a philosophy shaped by the frontier, wrought in the crucible of cultural difference, shot-through with conflicts, concords, resolutions, treaties, misunderstandings, deceptions, deceits, intrigues and oppositions. Without downplaying the role of genocide and forced cultural assimilation (which continues to this day), Pratt provides a story that forces us to reconsider the simple dualism of good versus bad and black versus white - since there are cases of whites acting distinctively native, just as their cases of natives acting distinctly white. In effect, Native Pragmatism can be of service to both groups in their ongoing attempts to understand themselves, each other, the historical interactions and circumstances that created the present situation, and strategies that have been adopted in the past.<br />Regardless of whether the terms pragmatism and Native American thought adhere in future scholarship, Native Pragmatism will certainly not be the last Native American Philosophy book. The white, Euroamerican, male-dominated world is just beginning to wake up to the fact that indigenous peoples are culturally rich and philosophically adept; and here Pratt takes this philosophy and its historical influence seriously. My only hope is that, with his next book, Pratt will explore the ecological and environmental implications of the colonial attitude, and delve deeper into the rich relationship between Native Americans and the land. Clearly, there is also an eco-philosophical difference that runs between the indigenous attitude and the colonial attitude - a difference that would fit nicely in his discussion of the 'logic of place.' One can only hope that Native Ecology and Pragmatism looms on the horizon. All in all, Pratt has written a fine book that demands gross reconsideration of American Philosophy and the influence of Native thought.lumps white people into one group and native people into other.

Even fewer know that she is also a Native American eco-philosopher with a critical perspective on the health and future prosperity of America. All Our Relations is particularly instructive, in that LaDuke surveys the entire American landscape (and by landscape, I am not merely referring to the political landscape), showing the deep connections that exist between local cultures, their environments, and the corporate-governmental giants that often compromise their health. Although LaDuke has specifically focused on Native American communities, the stories are engaging and instructive for Americans in general. Informative, powerful, and transformative, LaDuke here provides an antidote for our increasing alienation from the land and biota that sustain us. A must read for any conscious American.	2003-09-11

He has a talent for grasping the nub of an issue in crystal-clear, humorous prose. And yes, in a life as short and absurd as this, humor is important. For this reason, The Lexus and the Olive Tree make for an easy, enjoyable read. But for all that, Friedman's discussion lacks critical depth, historical scope, and completely downplays many of the unwanted side-effects of globalization:  e.g., the environmental crisis, the spiritual crisis, and the increasing loss of control over our communities to an emerging group of corporate powerhouses. Read The Lexus and the Olive Tree if you are looking for some feel-good cheerleading on the tsunami-like process that is taking the globe by storm, but don't stop there. For a more balanced and critical understanding of the complex phenomenon we call globalization, you should also check out the books Alternatives to Economic Globalization, put out by the International Forum on Globalization, and Eco-Economy, by Lester Brown.

As Wolff shows in this book, it would be more precise to say that are living in another world - a better world.<br /><br />Having spent half his youth growing up among Sng'oi, Wolff says this: \\"I learned early on to be in two different realities.\\" One reality was oriented around the clock, efficiency, technology, and harsh realism. The other was fluid, timeless, almost dreamlike - a world in which \\"people touched each other,\\" a world in which \\"we knew animals and plants intimately.\\" The bulk of this book is spent fleshing out differences between these worlds, in an attempt to teach us Westerners another way of knowing, another reality. Yet in the process of doing so, it quickly becomes apparent that the modern world doesn't quite measure up.<br /><br />As slaves to an alienating industrial system, we civilized people must pay rent to live. A completely self-domesticated species,  we live in a state of complete dependence on big industry and agriculture. We are ignorant of the flora and fauna that support our life, and helplessness to a capricious global market. Thus, the condescending glance \\"modern\\" humanity casts at so-called \\"primitive peoples\\" is extremely ironic.<br /><br />Traditionally referred to as \\"Sakai,\\" or slaves, by modern Malaysians, the Sng'oi do not take offense. Says one Sng'oi man, \\"We look at the people down below [literally, from up in the mountains] - they have to get up at a certain time in the morning, they have to pay for everything with money, which they have to earn doing things for other people. They are constantly told what they can and cannot do. No, we do not mind when they call us slaves.\\"<br /><br />At one point in the book, Wolff recounts a number of silent educational trips into the rainforest with his friend/guide, Ahmeed, who was subtly trying to teach him to interact and connect with the forest on his own terms. After days of walking, Wolff became thirsty. It was precisely then that Ahmeed decided to sneak off and leave him to find water on his own. After searching for hours, he not only discovered water - he also discovered another way of seeing. \\"When I leaned over drink from the leaf, I saw water with feathery ripples, I saw a few mosquito larvae wriggling on the surface, I saw the veins of the leaf through the water, some bubbles, a little piece of dirt... How beautiful, how perfect.\\" His perception suddenly \\"opened,\\" and a deep feeling of connection enveloped him. \\"The all-ness was everywhere, and I was a part of it... I could not be afraid - I was apart of this all-ness.\\"<br /><br />Contrast this with our culture, a culture walled-in with fear; a culture that \\"learns - has to learn - to shut off the senses, to protect oneself from all the noise.\\" Unlike the Sng'oi, who are brought up to listen, watch and feel their world in depth, our culture inhabits apsychological straightjacket. We are brought up to act like machines only to find ourselves replaced by machines built to act like humans. Perhaps our fear of the natural world explains why our economic system has set out to expand and colonize every wild space left on the globe. In the other world Wolff experienced, every day - indeed every second - was a miracle. Life, by no means perfect, was nevertheless full of smiles, stories, songs and dance. It was a world without fear and domination - until Komatsu bulldozers started coming to clear away the forest.<br /><br />The topics Wolff address in this book vary from indigenous medicine to education, from dream interpretation to surviving the onslaught of civilization. This is not simply anthropology or ethnology, but a critique of modern industrial civilization and it's \\"Development Scheme\\" in the gentle voice of someone intimate with the Sng'oi. In all, the bookamounts to nothing less than an alternative way of being. I found it refreshing, insightful and transformative - three criteria for any great book.<br /><br />Edit: New reports state that Sng'oi culture has been \\"absorbed\\" into the Malaysian population.<br /><br />j.w.k.way of being.

Ever feel tired, thwarted, disconnected or overworked? Ever feel as though you don't belong? These are some of the vague notions that often plague many of the so-called normal who are succeeding in life. Perhaps you are one of them. Or perhaps you have come closer to the pathology and directly experienced the violence, exploitation and abuse of life in the modern world. In response to the crises we all know by now, Glendinning's thesis - hailed as both obvious and brilliant - is that, behind the sparkles and glitter, we all suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome, induced from life inside Western Civilization.<br />A doctor of psychology, with years of work in the field under her belt - as well as personal taste of abuse our civilization deals out - Glendinning's diagnosis for our collective madness is illuminating and profound, constituting nothing less than a critique of Western Civilization, progress, normality and rationality. After providing example after example of the folly, abuse and suffering we continually inflict upon ourselves, our loved ones and the earth who created and sustains us, her thesis quickly passes from specious to plausible, from doubtful to obvious. Perhaps more enthralling than the pathology is the cure, though.<br />Not only a message of suffering and pain, Glendinning offers us hope, beauty and joy. Aside from critique, Glendinning provides concrete examples of cultures that - in contrast to our culture - offer full political and social participation, genuine democracy, equality of the sexes, leisure, good food and nutrition, stability, ecological sustainability, and most importantly a sense of a connection and belonging. In a word, she reconnects us with the traditions, cultures and communities abundant with all the things we have lost in the Faustian bargain for that evanescent more we call progress.

That said, I would like to caution potential readers. I almost put this book down halfway through, as it didn't seem to be leading anywhere, and the lack of character depth was irksome. I'm glad I didn't, though, because about half way through, like fragments of a jigsaw, all the disparate parts of the story came together in one seamless twist of events that will give you a new perspective on history, self, and place. Although The Holy is now experiencing similar reactions from Quinn fans, this older novel also received mixed reviews when it came out. Some said it was his best, while others said it was his worst. Without a doubt, this book is fundamentally different from Quinn's priors, like Ishmael and Story of B. Unlike them, After Dachau's message (presuming Quinn had a message in mind) is muddled and opaque, the tone dark and mysterious, leaving it the possiblity of being read on many levels. In other words, this book makes you think - which makes it worth reading in my book.	2003-05-07

It is basically the backdoor into the house of Berry's thought, the best way to familiarize oneself with his writings without buying all his books. In fact, to date, it is the only such compilation currently available.<br />For me personally, reading Berry is a kind of sacrament taken with the utmost reverence and joy. Like the bark of an ancient redwood tree, the essays are imbued with scent and deep, earthly texture. This language serves the underlying themes well -- themes of love, work, earth and health. Indeed, many of the essays set out explicitly to reestablish the hidden connections between body and soul, individual and community; the former necessarily connected with the land that created and sustains us. Like hymns to one's sense of place, one reads Berry and is transported back home.<br />\\"I came to see myself growing out of the earth like the other animals and plants. I saw my body and my daily motions as brief coherences and articulations of the energy of place, which would fall back into it like leaves in the autumn.\\"<br />Full of common sense, prophetic visions, poetic beauty and cogent analyses of America's cultural crises, these essays will retain their relevance and charm for generations if not millennia to come. At present, I can think of no single author better suited to guide us through these troubled times. Humble, illuminating, honest and profound -- this is one thinker not to be overlooked by anyone concerned with our fate as species and the fate of the planet as a whole. Definitely one of the most important, soul-satisfying books I have ever read.	2003-04-24

Some have said that the Fukuokan philosophy is the tap root of what is now more broadly called Permaculture, only Masanobu Fukuoka was a Japanese farmer, working with rice and winter grain in a southern Japanese climate. Both are no-till methods that shun the use of chemicals. However, Fukuoka should be set apart from farming in general and Permaculture in particular, in that The One-Straw Revolution is essentially a profound work of literary philosophy. Indeed, in many cases it reads like a naturalist's bible. Although the book is dressed in the language and anecdotes of a farmer, the message looms much larger. We read of a man who came to terms with the problem of death, and then decided to form a profoundly new (or is it old?) relationship with nature. In essence, the nugget of his wisdom is that, instead of struggling to control and command nature, we must learn to work with and learn from nature. Allow me to share one quote:\\"To build a fortress is wrong from the start. Even though he gives the excuse that it is for the city's defense, the castle is the outcome of the ruling lord's personality, and exerts a coercive force on the surrounding area. Saying he is afraid of attack and that fortification is for the town's protection, the bully stocks up weapons and puts the key in the door.\\" Now I ask you, does the following paragraph sound like the words of a farmer or a philosopher? From the face of it, one might think Fukuoka is here criticizing the nuclear arms race, but he is actually talking about the warlike mindset of farmers who see leaf-munching pests as evil enemies that must be fortified against, sought out and destroyed. Whether we are talking about bull weevils or communities, though, his advice is sound. We must change our frame of reference and establish a different relationship with the world. Concise and yet elegant, Fukuoka's prose is pregnant with meaning. Altogether, this work provides poetic an intelligent critique of industrial agricultural practices and the linear notions of nature and progress that underlay those practices. In fact, Fukuoka goes as far as to declare that the scientific method itself limits our experience and knowledge of nature.

Despite the monotony that is portrayed on television (black-block anarchists trashing Starbucks), this loose-fitting network of activists encompasses people from all sectors of society who share one thing in common: They are fed up - fed up with the World Bank and IMF, with closed-door trade meetings, and with surreptitious laws, like the ones that slipped genetically modified foods into our mouths. In a word, all across the globe people are sick and tired of \\"being acted on\\" by a group of international trade brokers and government leaders with fat pockets seeking to privatize away all the social services fought for and won throughout history.

In this latest book, he details the mass habitat destruction and species extinction, as well as some of the broader environmental issues we face. The picture is rather grim, to be sure, but perhaps a bit optimistic in comparison with Lester Brown's THE ECO-ECONOMY (a book I highly recommend).<br />His position, that we are entering a \\"bottleneck\\" crunch between what the earth can provide and what humanity demands, is neither new nor controversial, but well argued here. Indeed, the Earth is a closed system, with a limited resource availability; and once those resources are overburdened or exhausted, people start dying. Already some 60,000 people die every day while members of the so-called \\"First World\\" glut this limited bounty. Without a doubt, it will only get worse as the population rises.<br />The first chapter was a bit of a bore to me. I found it a little academic and a bit overly-specialized for my tastes. That said, chapters two, three and four (\\"The Bottleneck,\\" \\"Nature's Last Stand,\\" and \\"The Planetary Killer\\" respectively) easily make the book worth purchasing. I also found chapter six, which dicusses the hypothesis of \\"biophilia,\\" fascinating.<br />Biophilia - or what Wilson believes to be humanity's innate love and need for nature - is one of those hypotheses's we all suspected deep down but never had the scientific evidence to prove. However, after discussing the evolution of humanity and running through some interesting physchological cases, the theory seems rather plausible. While reading the chapter, I began to wonder if alternating feelings of anxiety and ennui were not related to some disconnection from nature. After all, I do feel best when hiking in the woods.<br />In the end, I decided to give this book four stars instead of five because of the last chapter. Although titled \\"The Solution,\\" it really didn't leave me feeling jazzed our prospects, if only because the the entire discussion was limited to conservation initiatives as proposed by big organizations, like the World Wildlife Fund. Outside of this approche, Wilson seems to have no experience, although he does at least awknowledge the need for activism on the last page.<br />Upon finishing the book, I felt the extreme desire to do something, but was left feeling small and helpless. Perhaps if he had included contact information for one of those activist groups. Moreover, Wilson completely downplays the risks and over-exaggerates the gains of genetically engineered (GM) foods; one particular flaw I can't overlook in a book. He didn't even mention the Cautionary Principle (see Suzuki's FROM NAKED APE TO SUPERSPECIES), which is absolutely fundamental to this issue. For a more thorough and discussion of the GM issue, check out Moore's AGAINST THE GRAIN or John Robbins THE FOOD REVOLUTION.<br />The one thing that Wilson does do well: he highlights and juxtiposes the position of biological conservationists and economists with suberb clarity. Without a doubt, between these two persectives lies the only possible road to salvation for humanity. Will we dig, extract and burn up the rest of the planet, or learn to think and act in compliance the principle of cyclical perpetuity? For a more nuanced discussion of this, I would recommend NATURAL CAPITALISM.

Many people are too busy playing video games, purchasing stock and/or taking vacations in the Caribbean to even realize we are in serious trouble. If you are a beginner to this line of thinking, Ishmael is the perfect place to start. It's like \\"Save the World 101,\\" taught by a really cool professor. At the end of the course, you are sure to know who you are and where you came from.<br />That said, many people finish Ishmael thinking, \\"What now?\\" A few friends of mine completed the book still believing everything is fine - that the planet is not dying, so party on. For people in this later camp, I suggest reading Eco-Economy (2001) by Lester Brown. After just ninety pages of that book, you will know - in a concrete, matter-of-fact way - how messed up this planet really is.<br />For those seeking practical advice on how to lessen their personal eco-wakes, I would recommend a few other books: like The Better World Handbook (2001), Stuff: The Secret Lives of Everyday Things (1997), and Affluenza: The All Consuming Epidemic (2001). Of the three, I would have to say that Affluenza was the most enjoyable.<br />In any event, you can't go wrong with Ishmael. Despite what's been said, it is a very original and penetrating book that is sure to please. Take note, though, this is not a novel. What we have here is a twenty-first century Platonic dialogue between a three-hundred-pound gorilla and Glaucon-like interlocutor. Bizarre indeed.	2003-02-20

Like a simmering stew, the book bubbles over with diveristy, as the author runs in and out of the poetic, historical, cultural and academic. Whereas others reviewers have found fault with the seemingly \\"unfocused\\" nature of the book, I was happily entertained. From cover to cover, the subject matter remains fresh and suprising. Some of the foods you can expect to encounter include boiled venison, baked rabbit, grilled corvina, tomatillo consommes, squash souffles, tepary bean burritos wrapped in mesquite tortillas, freshly picked and lightly steamed lamb quarters, purslane, tansy mustards, cress, prickly pear punch, mistletoe and Mormon tea. You will encounter organpipe cactus jam, stewed pumpkin, pinole, creosote bush salve, jojoba oil, damiana tea and pit roasted agaves - or \\"tatemada\\" - an ancient tradition the author and some local Indians revived, among others. Although the book runs thin on recipes (there are none), it liberally bastes philosophy: \\"If food is the sumptuous sea of energy we dive into and swim through every day, I have lived but one brief moment leaping like a flying fish and catching a glimmering glimpse of that sea roiling all around us. And then just as quickly, I splashed back beneath its surface, to be overmore immersed in what effortlessly buoys us up.\\" When Nabham is not introducing you old, now by-and-large forgotten foods and the cultures they come from, he is reminding you of the pitfalls of the emerging global marketplace: for example, \\"the average American brings home nearly 3,300 pounds of foodstuffs each year for his or her consumption...much of it never eaten. It is nearly two-and-a-half time the weight of what most of our contempories in other regions of the world consume, and much of it comes from their farmlands.\\" He also reminds us that, with each passing season, we are losing more top soil, more biodiversity, and more of the foods that help us keep us strong and healthy. A very important book that is also a pleasure to read. On a scale of deliciousness, I give it a peach cobbler.biodiversity, and more of the foods that help us keep us strong and healthy.

After reading it, I had so many question, I felt the need to talk with the author in person. After tracking down his number, I gave him a call (noting how odd it was to be talking with an \\"anarcho-primitivist\\" on the phone) and we arranged to meet the following week.<br /><br />Within no time, I was down in Eugene, Oregon, walking through the infamous Whitaker district, known for it's vagrants and black-block anarchists, searching for Zerzan's co-op.<br /><br />After spotting him on the porch, he greated me and invited me into his small, box-shaped house. Asside from a desk and a giant bookcase filled to the brim with old ragtag books and zines, his little house was empty and austere.<br /><br />Sitting on an old, cleary-secondhand softa, we talked for over an hour about anarchism, ecology, history, technology, society, permaculture, natural farming and ecovillages. Then we took a walk to a local, independent coffee house to chat some more.<br /><br />What struck me about Zerzan was his humility, patience, kindness, and penchent for critical thought. I mentioned my suprise that he had a telephone, and he agreed, in an ideal world one would not need a telephone. But, he said, he does not have a watch, or any of the other things that weigh us down and distract more than they help. Despite his revolutionary prose, I realized that a certain degree of compromise must be made for those who wish to stay inside civil society and reform it.<br /><br />Sure, one could pack up and go live in a commune, but how would that help? The global economy would still spin out of control, and people would continue to live in ways that destroy the planet. Aside from the phone (and I have heard now that he sometimes borrows a friend's computer), which keeps him connected to the larger movement as well as curious people like me, Zerzan purposefully chooses to live as \\"primitive\\" as possible - a word and way of life he esteems for reasons outlined in this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading RUNNING ON EMPTINESS even if you are an avowed progressive or technophile, if only for the sake of balance. As Zerzan shows, technological progress is not a unilinear process of self-refinement. In many ways it has alienated us from self, other and earth.<br /><br />For those who have already begun to notice that civilization is not all roses, this book is absolutely essential. There is perhaps no better perspective on this subject.

Where there was once culture, we now have an expanding economic order threatening all life on the planet. Through its mechanism of growth and expansion, the global economy is conquering and converting life's diversity into an ecological and social monoculture of cash crops, Levis, soda pop and movie theatres. Perhaps moonscape would be a better word. Of course, it doesn't have to be this way. Our fast-paced, increasingly technological, capital-intensive, fossil fuel-centered, centralized, highly specialized, travel and commercial-oriented, often stressful society is by no means the end-all-be-all of human history. Murder, child abuse, drug abuse, theft, poverty, hunger, and every other problem that plagues the West are not products of human nature. The pathology of civilization is not natural or inevitable, and the Ladakhi are proof of this. Read this book and rediscover ancient, profound, life-affirmating alternatives to the modern humdrum.

I've been waiting for this book for a long time. As an environmental philosopher, I have come to believe that ecovillages (or urban villages - the Global Ecovillage Network doesn't distinguish) are our only hope for survival on this planet. And this is the best book available on the subject.<br />A quick glance at modern society shows many signs of cultural and economic stress: including war, militarization, gun violence, media violence, over-consumption of resources, overpopulation, failing democracy, money in politics, monopolization, sexual inequality, racism, inadequate health care, rising crime rates, advertisement glut, commercialized education, materialism, community fragmentation, work-related stress, mass layoffs, poverty, and a mass sense of alienation - from self, other and nature.<br />Signs of biological stress in the natural world are even more daunting. Fisheries are collapsing, forests are shrinking, rangelands are deteriorating, soils are eroding, species are disappearing, global temperatures are rising, rivers are draining dry, water tables are falling, the ozone layer is depleting, more destructive storms are brewing, the polar ice caps are melting and sea level is rising (see ECO-ECONOMY for details on the eco-crisis). It is in this context that Chris Bright's warning rings ominous: \\"Nature has no reset buttons.\\"<br />Trapped in the confines of global economic corporatism, we must ask, Could it be that the fundamental design of society is flawed? Are large nation-states and even larger corporations conducive to ecological and cultural health? How about wage labor and the monetary system in general? How do we go about creating unique and beautiful communities without inequality, hunger, insecurity, want - and without killing the planet? In a word, how can we live the Good Life? Is it possible?<br />The answer to all of these problems is the same, and you will find them in this book. Ecovillages are the answer! In this book you can expect to find a great collection of photographs, wonderful charts and graphs, maps, people profiles, design layouts, philosophical perspectives and the historical background of the ecovillage movement. There is no better book on the subject, and no more important subject for the new millennium. How else will homo sapiens reach homeostasis on this planet?

I would like to think that I would have protested the slaughter by working underground with escapees. However, I might have been a totally different person. Perhaps the harsh SS training would have turned my heart into an icicle, filled my head full of propaganda, and habitualized my body to subordination. Perhaps I would have been a willing executioner. Perhaps it would have been impossible for me to lift my consciousness above the zeitgeist - not many did. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20. Understanding the present is much more difficult. Could it be that colonialism, imperialism, the KKK, and every other boot-licking, world-plundering, cold-blood-murdering institution somehow mutated and merged into one New World Order bent on killing the planet and everything/-one that stands in its way? Moreover, if one were raised inside such an institution, believing it completely natural, and even being rewarded for participation in its mundane work-a-day activities, would it be possible for that person to awake to the insanity of their culture? Along with all of us, Derrick Jensen grew up inside such a culture, realized what was happening, and wrote this book to tell other potential executioners what is going on. Reading The Culture of Make Believe is like looking into the mirror of our culture, and chances are you will not like what you see. I'm not saying this to rub it in your face, but to give a word of caution. Let me to be more explicit. If you are able to accept new information into the ken of your mind, this book will radically alter your perception of reality. You might not be able to live the same way there after. It's like having the psychological sanity rug pulled out from under you - or blasted to pieces. Upon finishing, you will feel as if you had a full-frontal lobotomy, or as though you just swallowed a gallon of hydrochloric acid. That's the aftertaste of Western Civilization - no frappacino.Sounds ambitious, most people would agree. I imagine submitting Jensen's thesis to Ph.D. advisors. \\"What's your topic?\\" they'd ask. \\"I want to write a critique of Western Civ.\\" After a giggle, they would reply with something like, \\"Sorry, it's too broad. Narrow it.\\" Well, if you count A Language Older Than Words (the thematically congruent if discontinuous part I of this book), Jensen foots the bill in a mere 984 pages, which, although placing it somewhere on par with War and Peace, nonetheless forms a tight, if unusually bulky critique of this 3,000-year institution. Altogether or taken separately, the two books provide one hell of a tour I highly recommend. Jensen's authenticity bleeds off the page.<br /><br />Essential reading.<br /><br />j.w.k.appacino.Sounds ambitious, most people would agree.

If you are looking to save the world via non-fiction, look no further than Hidden Connections. This book will provide you with everything you need (including a new mind and new conception of self) to get right with the ecosphere and the damage we have all helped inflict upon her. (Don't think the world is in trouble, see Lester Brown's ECO-ECONOMY).<br />Not a science buff, chapter one didn't blow my doors, although I was interested by what Capra had to say and (luckily) was able to wrap my head around all the concepts. In this chapter, he traces the evolution of life on the planet, and therewith provides a novel definition of life. A good place to start any book, I suppose, but certainly one about the future prospects of life on this planet.<br />Chapter two deals with mind and consciousness. In this chapter, Capra bridges the ancient Cartesian chasm between mind and body, defines cognition and consciousness, and explains the meaning of language. He even throws out some theories about the origin and evolution of all the above.<br />Chapter three breaks from the previous two chapters, as Capra delves into social reality. In this chapter he gives meaning to the world &quot;meaning,&quot; explains social theory from Max Weber to Habermas, discusses human freedom, explains the three forms of power (coercive, compensatory, and conditioned power, or education), and talks about technology and culture.<br />For me, the book really picks up with chapter four, &quot;Life and Leadership in Organizations.&quot; This chapter, Capra discusses what the definition of life means when applied to the corporate business world. Issues such as managment, labor rights, and the role of creativity are sure to please. It is this chapter that gets the ball rolling, which doesn't stop until the very last page.<br />Chapter seven almost left me breathless. Here Capra provides a thoroughgoing critique of the globalization. Books like THE CASE AGAINST THE GLOBAL ECONOMY are much longer and more detailed, but that is exactly what gives Capra's presentation unique: As with every subject, he synthesizes his argument into concise, lazer-like prose, drawing upon the work of hundreds of scholars, all well-documented in an A++ index.<br />Chapter eight deals with biotechnology, perhaps the defining charadcteristic of 21st century. This chapter covers a lot of ground: He explains genes, advances the freewill-determinism argument (freewill wins), gives a concise history of the Green Revolution, genetically modified organisms, the silent organic revolution, biopiracy, ecodesign, and biomimicry. As with the chapter on the global economy, this chapter is  written in stunning prose that will not disappoint.<br />The last chapter is called &quot;Changing the Game&quot;. In this chapter, Capra outlines the ecocide we are inflicting on the planet (again, a subject discussed singularly and to great satisfaction in ECO-ECONOMY), and what we can do to fix it. In this chapter, he gives a coherent definition of sustainability, outlines ecolitery, explains solar power, hypercars, converstion to a zero-waste hydrogen economy, and green tax shift that supports employment and taxes non-sustainable practices.<br />The way in which Capra weaves the concept of the network throughout the whole of this book is facinating, a subject which harkens back to his last book, THE WEB OF LIFE. Throughout HIDDEN CONNECTIONS, you will be exposed to many of networks with subtle power that is revolutionizing human culture and the fate of the planet as a whole:  including academic networks, social protest networks and political networks. You will not finish this volume without feeling completely changed - and informed. No doubt, ecoliteracy can save the planet. I highly recommend this book.<br />A quote to wet your whistle: &quot;Whereas the extraction of resources and the accumlation of waste are bound to reach their ecological limits, the evolution of life has demonstrated for more than three billion years that in a sustainable Earth houshold, there are no limits to development, diversification, innovation, and creativity.&quot;ical limits, the evolution of life has demonstrated for more than three billion years that in a sustainable Earth houshold, there are no limits to development, diversification, innovation, and creativity.&quot;	2002-11-10

Although novels, they will introduce you to the historical and philosophical background you need to fully appreciate this book. If you are a Quinn fan already, this is a wonderful little addition to the curriculum (one dare not say catechism) that will take you deeper into the intricacy of his tribal vision. Here, we come a little closer to conceptualizing what tribalism actually means in pragmatic terms as it relates to the modern context. Today, we are caught up in an economic system that spawns all kinds of problems:  starvation, war, poverty, work-related stress, environmental destruction and so on. Trapped in the confines of global economic corporatism, we must ask, Could it be that the fundamental design of society (large nation-states and even larger multinational corporations, huge divisions of wage labor brochered with a monetary medium, etc.) are not conducive to the Good Life?  And if not, how do we get there?  How do create unique and beautiful societies without inequality, hunger, insecurity and want? Although I don't think Quinn fully answers the question here (who could?), the book will get you thinking along new lines, and asking some really rich, powerful and liberating questions. Quinn beckens us to ponder the fundamental tension of modern life: namely, how it is that we shall come together to eat, live, and work. With this book, we advance another step toward solving the Riddle of the Sphinx. A pleasurable if quick read that is sure to please.

Masterful, artistic, sweeping in scope, gripping.  You cannot go wrong with this book. Pick up a copy today and be a different person tomorrow. Now, onto the more rigorous arts of reviewing....<br />After reading criticisms of this book, I felt that I had to write an apologetic review, for Quinn's view is not only historically and anthropologically accurate (so far as history and science now claim to know), but - irregardless of petty academic quibbling - Quinn's vision is essential for the future of this planet, and all its abounding and beautiful life.<br />Number one.  People have said that The Story of B is a novel without references, and so it therefore lacks academic standing. True, it is a novel, and there are no references. However, if you one has any understanding of the many academic disciplines Quinn draws from, references are not a problem. For example, Quinn states that human population is a function of food supply, and that curbing policies like education and contraceptives matter little. The real solution to our booming population, with its booming consumption, and booming environmental impacts, is to stop increasing food supply every year. Need a scientific paper to validate this? Check out \\"Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply\\" (March, 2001) by Russell Hopfenber and David Pimentel, two leading agricultural and population scientists. Other facts about native cultures or the history of Western Civilization can easily be retrieved any modern encyclopedia. (By the way, Quinn used to make a living writing such encyclopedias.)<br />Other people have said that Quinn's treatment of religion is one-sided and flat wrong.  It should be noted here that Quinn was raised in a religious environment, and that he even entered monastic life for a spell. True, the book does level criticisms against any faith that seeks redemption of self at the expense of planet and community; any faith that seeks to deny that the universe is beautiful, mystical, and richly complex. However, for those not adverse to thinking about the meaning of their faith and perhaps revising their faith in light of different views and facts, this book is no antichrist. I personally found the religious critique secondary to its deeper message, which, when accepted, applies to anyone of any faith.<br />Lastly, for those of you who have not already been initiated into Quinn's writing, don't be afraid to start with The Story of B. Although the second part of a trilogy that begins with Ishmael and ends with My Ishmael, The Story of B works well as a standalone. For more info on Quinn and his project, check out his website, the Ishmael Community at Ishmael dot com. The New Tribal Adventures group is great fun, too. You cannot go wrong with this author.

With 5 new chapters, updated statistics and a revamp, we now know that it is possible to improve upon perfection.)<br />By far, the most comprehensive, well-researched, incisive documentation of systemic corporate abuse available. However, When Corporations Rule is not simply a litany of profligate corporate excess. Korten explains the dysfunctional logic of our system, outlines the horrendous consequences for community and environment, and provides clear, cogent plans of action to restore democracy and awaken culturally.<br />The thesis is so obvious it is a wonder no one has formulated before. We always harangue socialism as an \\"extreme ideology,\\" but capitalism is also an extreme ideology. Socialism concentrates power in a centralized government, creating unsupportable social and environmental costs. Likewise, capitalism concentrates power in huge private institutions (the modern multinational corporation), which also have enormous social and environmental costs. Both advance the concentration of rights of ownership without limit, to the exclusion of the needs and rights of the many who own virtually nothing. And as Korten points out, the impoverished many are growing.<br />As of 1992, the richest 20 percent of the global population received as much as 82.7 percent of the total world income. The poorest 20 percent received 1.4 percent. These figures indicate growing economic inequality, which is has become even more pronounced in the last decade. In 1998, the world's top three billionaires totaled more assets than the combined GNP of all the least developing countries and their 600 million people. Of the world's 6 billion people, 2.8 - that is, nearly half - were living on less than $2 a day. Some 1.2 billion of that half lived on less than a dollar a day.<br />Inside America - the global economic trendsetter - this growing global inequality is mirrored in microcosm. In fact, inequality and hardship is even more exaggerated in the Land of the Free. The wealthiest 10 percent now owns almost 90 percent of all business equity, 88.5 percent of all bonds, and 89.3 percent of all stocks. In 1999, the total compensation of U.S. corporate CEOs was 475 times the average production worker's pay; and 29 percent of all U.S. workers were in jobs paying poverty level wages, defined as an hourly wage too low to meet the needs of a family of four. Moreover, with each new mega-merger, more capital, power and control are concentrated in these already mammoth institutions.<br />These are just a few of the statistics sited in the book, but When Corporations Rule offers more than statistical analysis. With laser precision, Korten assays economic and political history, uncovering the reasons for these global trends:  including the illusion of growth, the loss of governmental oversight in the affairs of corporations, the rise of the Newtonian mechanical worldview and its subsequent devaluation of spiritual values, etc. His critique of globalization was absolutely stunning:  including the effects of NAFTA, and the general policies of the WTO, the WB and the IMF. Finally, his call for localism, activism, spiritualism, and an ecological awakening are inspiring and timely.<br />Not a stone goes uncovered. The failure of development strategies for the Third World (his stated specialty), critical discussion of traditional economic theory, the rise of PR, global poverty, currency speculation and corporate raiding, downsizing, contracting labor, automating, the loss of the small farm, the effects of Wal-Mart and the like, ecological collapse, the coming Ecological Revolution, sustainability, socially responsible investment, systems theory, urban design, history of the current globalization protest movement, detailed agenda for democratic change - these and so many other important issues are weaved together in a remarkable argument that will move you.

Along with John Robbins' The Food Revolution (which I also highly recommend), there is no better book on the subject.  After reading both books, I have decided to become a vegan. It's healthy, ecological, and much kinder toward animals.  That said, you need only care about one of the above to make the single most important change in your life. Allow me to begin with some facts: 1) A vegan diet can reduce the risk of heart disease to nearly zero. 2) Vegans have half the chance of getting cancer as meat and dairy eaters. 3) Vegans do not die from Mad Cows disease. 4) The meat industry teats animals so horribly I had to skip over that section in the book. Note that vegan diets do not harm animals at all. 5) 40,000 children die each day, mostly from starvation or hunger-related disease. 6) The entire world could be fed on a vegan diet; instead, we run our grain through cattle and sell it off to the rich. 7) Vegan diets consume much less of the earth's resources: less water, grain, and energy. 8) American rangeland is an ecological moonscape. Although by not means a rigorously proven scientific fact, it should also be noted that many vegans report increased energy levels, better brain functioning, higher self-esteem, and increased resistance to disease and colds after making the dietary switch.  The author asks, \\"Is it reasonable to assume that the human brain...functions identically no matter how it is nourished? Is it logical that a diet of beef and chicken and ice cream will produce the same thoughts and emotions as a diet of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains?\\"  As scientists learn more and more about the nutritional and healing powers of fruits and vegetables, we are gaining a better understanding of the relationship between diet and physical and mental health.  In any event, there is a long list of great vegetarians that point toward this relationship:  including Leonardo Da Vinci, George Bernard Shaw, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Mahatma Gandhi, Leo Tolstoy, and so on.  Some of the most intelligent and kind-hearted people in the world were vegetarians before the -ism was even born. They intuitively grasped the relationship between a plant-based diet and health, and recognized the need to act compassionatley toward animals.  A very disarming book, the author's writing style is easy-going and matter-of-fact, affecting a clear, earnest, scientific tone.  The preface was even written by former rancher/300lb. football player turned vegan, Howard Lyman, who's story will move you. After meeting him, you be introduced to doctors, nutritional biochemist, epidemiologists, and ecologists who have discovered many objective reasons to make a leap of dietary faith. I cannot over-recommend this book.  While you are at it, pick up a copy of The Food Revolution.  Read them both, and then pass them on. Just as the cover promises, reading and internalizing this book is the surest way to heal our planet and your body.<br /><br />Two birds, one stone.

However, having had no formal architectural training, his understanding of the subject in general, and what we have done to the physical fabric of our country in specific, is profound, enlightening and deeply important.  For despite what we might imagine, \\"buildings foster certain kinds of behavior in humans.\\"  And our rush to pave over the nation with strip malls, urban sprawl, industrial parks, and seven-lane freeways (\\"anti-places\\") all tend to suppress and distort our better natures.  Reading this book is both humorous and disheartening at the one and same time.  It is humorous and easy to read, because the author's writing style is mature, articulate, and witty - clearly one of the quirks of his being a novelist.  Disheartening, because it plainly documents how American cities have devolved into bleak, relentless, noisy, squalid, smoky, smelly, explosively expanding, socially unstable, dehumanizing sinkholes of industrial foulness congested with ragtag hordes of racing automobiles. In response to the tragedy of our cities, we seek escape.  After the war, most Americans jumped into the wagon and fled for the suburbs.  However, even there we find no guarantee of spiritual or physical ease.  Cut off from grocery stores, city-centers, cafes, and work, we end up spending half our life (not to mention half our income) \\"sitting inside a tin can on the freeway.\\"  We have become \\"a drive-in civilization,\\" scuttling between non-descript office malls, \\"schools that look fertilizer factories,\\" warehouse-like grocery stores, paved-over mega malls, and the congested cities we left behind in the first place - all because none of these places are within walking or biking distance after having fled to the suburbs.  In fact, life in the suburbs is so unsatisfactory that we seek alternate escape routes, having no other place to flee.  The majority of our free time is spent glued in front of the TV screen or at the theatre, where we catch glimpses of a better world.  When we are not in either of those places, we \\"escape to nature\\" via a weekend camping trip (because nature knows how to design esthetically-pleasing places) or head to Disneyland.  Ah, Disneyland.... \\"The public realm in America became so atrocious in the postwar decades that the Disney Corporation was able to create an artificial substitute for it and successfully sell it as a commodity.\\"  Americans love Disney world, as the author points out, because it is only social terrain left that has not been colonized by the car.  Although we may not realize it on a conscious level, \\"The design quality of Disney World ... is about 1.5 notches better than the average American suburban shopping mall or housing subdivision - so Americans love it.\\"  Yet this fantasy land is \\"ultimately less satisfying than reality, and only deepens our hunger for the authentic.\\"In essence, the book is one long screed against shoddy civic design, car-centered development, single-use zoning laws (a subject that enrages the author to the point of profanity), and loss of excellence and beauty in architectural design.  In place of these, the author wishes to reinvigorate community connectivity, enliven the public sphere, enthrone commonsense zoning laws, and start designing beautiful, lasting structures - just like we used to.  As the author reminds us, \\"In such a setting, we feel more completely human. This is not trival.\\" The alternative?

Not only does he want to make a change, but he has access to information that is truly global in scope. There may perhaps be no other author with such an intimate understanding of the trends that now face humanity at the dawn of this new century.<br /><br />The first quarter of the book provides a bird's-eye view of our planet, a planet in decline. Whatever undefined notions you might have had about what writer Thomas Berry has termed 'ecocide' will suddenly be very clear. Afer a litany of statistics that are absolutely mind-boggling, Brown's statement, \\"we are losing the war to save the planet,\\" no longer smacks of hyperbole. However, this is no pessimist's rant.<br /><br />The next third of the book outlines a stunning vision of Brown's eco-economy. Don't mistake, this is not eco-utopia - but damn close! Cars that produce water as waste. Sustainable fisheries and forest that don't collapse. An economy based on wind and solar-power. His vision of a sustainable tomorrow is nothing less than the measure of today. I hesitate to think of what will happen if we continue with business as usual, that is, if we continue with our fossil-fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economy.<br /><br />The last third of the book outlines the practical steps we must make in order to bring about this eco-era. These include: a tax shift that hits messy industries, the end of government subsidized deforestation, quality ecolabeling (voting with our wallets), and tradable permits that set well-defined limits on, say, units of fish caught per year. Brown, like so many oher eco-economists, also emphasizes the need to work within the limits of our natural capital (nature's productive and absorbtion capacity).<br /><br />Every section of this book is cogently argued, factual and compelling, and his ideas for change are stunning. From the role of NGOs and the United Nations to individual initiatives, like green power options, this book is very down to earth and pragmatic about change. Unlike most studies in ecology, economics, or politics, Brown doesn't limit himself to one aspect of the discussion. You get the facts, a comprehensive vision, and the concrete steps required to bring that vision into reality.<br /><br />This is a must read for anybody interested in environmentalism, economics, futurism, or governmental policy in general. The Washington Post nailed it on the head when they described Brown as \\"One of the world's most influential thinkers.\\" Read this book, and see the world through this remarkable man's eyes.<br /><br />Essential reading.<br /><br />j.w.k.m the role of NGOs and the United Nations to individual initiatives, like green power options, this book is very down to earth and pragmatic about change.

I still remember when they broke out.  It was like having the rug pulled out from underneath my feet.  One day you are carefree, the next you are sneezing your brains out.  Work was out of the question.  Everything was out of the question.  My life was a living hell, and I wondered what I could do to regain some semblance of health and sanity.  With this book, I found out that I am not the only one, and that my immune system is not evolutionary backwater.  Something else is happening here.  38 percent of Americans have at least one kind of allergy.  That is over 100 million people.  Make no mistake, allergies have reached epidemic proportions.  However, it wasn't always this way.  Allergies, along with asthma and various other strange immune system diseases, have been one the rise ever since industrialism went overdrive circa 1950.  The link is undeniable:  Allergies are correlated with the Western Lifestyle.  People from the so-called Third World have fever allergies, and when they immigrate to America or other industrialized countries their allergy rate quickly blends in with the population.  In other words, we are not talking about genetics.  Environmental factors are clearly at play.  The authors of this book have done a wonderful job tracing both allergies and asthma.  Anything you might possibly want to know about the two is in this book.  Their approach is broad.  Instead of focusing merely on conventional methods, they take a \\"blended\\" or \\"integrated\\" approach, embracing traditional, environmental and alternative practices.  As they say, this gives patients more options, thereby providing more potential remedies to stem the burgeoning epidemic of sneezing and wheezing.  Why limit yourself to pills, which often have absurd side-effects?  From Chinese herbalism and acupuncture to medical prescription drugs, this book has it all.  They have integrated thousands of university studies, and quote MDs across the board.  Does drinking wheatgrass help?  How does it measure up to the gold standard conventional methodology of double-blind, placebo controlled studies?  Do carotenoids, flavonoids, and essential fatty acids affect our immunofunctioning?  Do allergy shots work?  From mind-body techniques to sinus irrigation and detoxification, you will be exposed to all; and the authors always detail everything in terms of science, making sure to note risks, side-effects, and other potential concerns.  With this book, I learned so much.  Without it, I would not have been able to integrate an approach that includes lifestyle, environmental, and conventional medicine options.<br /><br />Imperative for those with allergies.<br /><br />j.w.k.across the board.

The answer, of course, is an overwhelming no. And if we do, it's not for very long. We don't think about these problems, we don't talk about them, and more importantly we don't try and stop them. In Jensen words, \\"We don't think about them, because they are too horrific to comprehend.\\" They are too foreboding and ominous to stomach. They are, in effect, unspeakable.<br /><br />After taking an honest look at the evolution of Western Civilization, Jensen draws the only logical conclusion that can be found: Our culture is insane. We are off our collective rocker. Reason, science, technological advancement and the work-a-day world have only driven us deeper into the carnival of horror and madness. Things are not getting better. They are getting worse with each passing day. Oops, I went and said it.<br /><br />But you still believe in progress. Casually examine the context of your own life. In the last fifty years, \\"sane\\" men have killed 100,000,000 of their \\"sane\\" fellows (perhaps now a few women have gotten in on the action too). Maybe you knew some of them. Perhaps they were family members. Or perhaps it was you that dropped bombs, laid land mines, pulled the fatal trigger. Or perhaps, like me, your father went off to war and came back crazy. War... an aspect of our culture that is now more familiar and ordinary than ever before. (Need I even mention what \\"Dubya\\" is planning right now?)<br /><br />Yet we are all live in work in this web of destruction together. Perhaps your paycheck comes with each fresh clear-cut, or perhaps you simply buy those clear-cut trees in the form of a new house, deck, or furniture. Perhaps you draw energy from a dammed river, helping kill off the last of the salmon. Or perhaps you are more intimately linked to the web of murder, genocide, mass rape, abuse, wage slavery, systemic impoverishment and ecocide that characterize life in the twentieth, and now twenty-first, centuries. Perhaps you are a victim. Perhaps you are an abuser. More than likely, you dabble in both.<br /><br />That said, wherever you fall within the totem of abuse, don't ever admit there is a problem. Don't say with me, \\"My name is j.w.k., and I live and take part in a system that is utterly abusive, coercive and wrong.\\" Rather, keep telling yourself that everything is fine. That is all right. Yes, we'll pull through. Humans are too bright to destroy themselves and the planet.<br /><br />But that is exactly what we are doing... A fourth of all animals slated for extinction - 1000 times the natural rate of extinction. (\\"The government will do something. Anyway, extinction is part of life.\\") A quarter of all American women are raped, and another 19 percent are sexually abused. (\\"They should take self-defense courses and stop wearing such sluttish clothes.\\") Skin, prostate, colon and breast cancers are on the rise from industrial pollution, UV radiation exposure, and poor food quality. (\\"Our scientists will fix it. They'll invent something new and make it all better.\\") 150,000,000 children are enslaved, carrying bricks, chained to looms, or otherwise filling the Wal-Mart's of the Western world. (\\"Work builds character.\\") 32,000 people die of hunger everyday, in a world where one billion are too busy stuffing their faces with steak and marshmallows to care. (\\"I can hardly pay my own bills.\\")<br /><br />Rationalizations... Sometimes witty, sometimes humorous, but always easy, efficient and painless ways to avoid the facing cognitive dissonance. They are the bedrock of our philosophy in a world awash with deprivation, hunger, war, famine, abuse, and ignorance amid waste, plenty and absurdity. Nazi Germany was good at rationalizing, too. Smoke billows up from Auschwitz: \\"It sure is a cloudy, Heinrich, isn't it?\\"<br /><br />\\"When we do allow self-evident truths to percolate past our defenses and into our consciousness, they are treated like so many hand grenades rolling across the dance floor of an improbably macabre party.\\"<br /><br />Today we all live under concentration camp conditions, without even realizing. We also live in a world of hopeless and impending death.  The only difference is, we can watch TV and pretend `it's all good.' As Kunster says in Home From Nowhere, \\"We demand fantasy in order to distract ourselves from the reality of life's tragic nature, and since reality tends to be insistent, we must keep the TVs turned on at all waking hours and at very high volume.\\" Bring on the CNN. Hail Friends, Survivor, and the Comedy Channel.<br /><br />Comedy amid horrors - next to oil it's our best selling commodity. After waking up to apocalypse every morning, one gets used to it. It becomes completely natural. Yet in our more lucid moments, should reality suddenly appear the phantasmagoria of pain, suffering, and hell it truly is, we can deny everything. We can take mental holidays or look the other way; but one thing is becoming increasing clear: We cannot play the denial game much longer. Something will give. If we do not awake from this nightmare of plutonium, rape, genocide and ecocide, we will most certainly perish along with the rest of the species we have consigned to eternal oblivion. Even our scientists now say so - when they can be heard over 500 billion screaming TVs.<br /><br />Don't believe it, though. Don't believe any of it. It's a bunch of lies. Propaganda.

And this is not so surprising, considering the average American hosts up to 500 different chemicals in his or her body. Of course, our chemical body burden is rising as more trace amounts of pain relievers, more antibiotics, more birth control pills, more perfumes, more codeine, more antacids, more cholesterol-lowering agents, more antidepressants, more estrogen replacement drugs, more chemotherapy agents, more sunscreen lotion, more hormones from feed lots, more pesticides, more herbicides and more fungicides make their way into our drinking water, air and food. In a word, we are literally poisoning ourselves to death with affluence.<br /><br />Perhaps worst of all, spiritual sickness is sweeping across the country. More people feel \\"empty\\" than ever before. Fewer people are contentment with their work. Fourteen million Americans use illegal drugs, twelve million are heavy drinkers, and sixty million are hooked on tobacco. Five million Americans cannot stop gambling away their income and savings - while, at the shopping malls, compulsive buyers often report a feeling of heightened sensations, or a heightened sense of awareness. \\"Colors and textures are more intense, and extreme levels of focus and concentration are often achieve - literally, altered states of consciousness. Some extreme shoppers compare their highs to drug experiences, while others have compared the moment of purchase to an orgasm.\\"<br /><br />Largely because of the American lifestyle (and those who mimic it), the world is on the brink of collapse. Few of us realize this, and those who see the writing on the wall often find it easier to live in denial than attempt to change. But these are the facts: A quarter of the world's plants are threatened with extinction by the year 2010. More than 38 percent of U.S. amphibians are endangered. Three-quarters of all bird species are declining in numbers. One-third of the North American freshwater fish are rare or endangered. About 100 invertebrate species are lost each day due to deforestation (many from urban sprawl). 25 percent of all mammal species are threatened with extinction. In other words, because of the emerging global economy and personal consumption habits, we are losing species from at a rate 1000 times faster than the natural rate of planetary evolution.<br /><br />Affluenza is does not just outline the disturbing facts we all should know, it also outlines a clear plan for change, from \\"downshifting\\" and the simplifying your life to overt political strategies. It offers sustainable lifestyle suggestions as well as political action pointers. The authors genuinely want people to be happy, healthy, and free - not mere slaves to a corporate machine that is killing the planet. They note that people are genuinely satisfied when their work is fulfilling. People also seem to be satisfied when they are out in nature. Today we are both working less fulfilling jobs and seeing less of nature. But as the authors show, it doesn't have to be this way. You can learn to simplify your life and pursue those things which genuinely matter in life.<br /><br />In short, Affluenza provides a broad outline of our illness as a species and the only cure in sight. I highly recommend giving it a read. Would have posted 100 stars if possible.<br /><br />JWKhings which genuinely matter in life.

Some one hundred years before the novel begins, a doctor was called to Pala in an effort to cure the local King of cancer. He ended up staying permanently, and therewith influencing Pala's social evolution.<br />As fate would have it, the good doctor was blessed with an open mind, and so the distinctly Western influences he brought to Pala were benign - in fact helpful.  Between his New Age science and the King's Tantrik Buddhism, the island maintained a stunning balance between the Eastern and the Western. Everything clicked. Utopia.<br />On the island, education is biological, spiritual, and deeply psychological. Teachers start with ecology, and gradually \\"bridge\\" to every other area of thought - even metaphysics. Although children are given all the time in the world to use their imagination, Pala's teachers \\"never give children a chance of imagining that anything exists in isolation.

Rub it in.\\"<br />Religion on Pala was pantheistic and pagan in nature. Lots of references to Buddhism, Taoism, chanting, and inner spirituality. In fact, the book itself is a sort of spiritual tour de force, wherein Huxley promulgates another beautiful version of his Mind with a capital M theory.<br />Industrialization of the island never really occurred as such.  Instead, Palanesians embrace selective industrialization (no motor scooters, no Sears and Roebuck) and import certain technologies to meet daily needs - like massive refrigeration units to keep crops from rotting between seasons, and a small degree of electricity to support scientific research and whatnot.<br />Pala's sociological structure is strange strange Huxleyan strange.  A mixture of social parenting, fertility control, and religious ceremonies involving \\"moksha-medicine\\" - \\"the reality revealer, the truth-and-beauty pill\\" - \\"four hundred milligrams of revelation\\" - the best way to keep the islanders from biting into the \\"Tree of Consumer Goods.\\" (Why chase the Western god of innovation when you can chase the dragon?)<br />As one of the natives, Dr. Robert, points out, \\"We don't give ourselves coronaries by guzzling six times as much saturated fat as we need. We don't hypnotize ourselves into believing that two television sets will make us twice as happy as one television set. And finally we don't spend a quarter of the gross national product preparing for World War III or even World War's baby brother, Local War MMMCCCXXXIII.\\" Instead the conduct more research on maksha, hone educational techniques, and make lots and lots war oldest enemy, love.<br />Like any good utopia, a number of critical issues must be addressed head-on. The reality issue is one. On this note, Huxley scores a perfect ten. The book is very realistic; so much so, in point of fact, that he drags the reader to the bottomless depths of \\"Pure and Applied Pointlessness\\" and the \\"Essential Horror\\" (the omnipresence of death, the precarious of all existence) before building and bridging into Pala's social philosophy of \\"Pure and Applied Mahayana\\" Buddhism and \\"Pure and Applied Science\\" - a religious and practical science of optimism and wellbeing.<br />It is only after diving and climbing out of these incredible depths solitude and despair that one learns to see again. \\"Liberate your selves from everything you know and look with complete innocence at this infinitely improbable thing before you.  Look at it as though you'd never seen anything of the kind before, as though it had no name and belonged to no recognizable class.  Look at it alertly but passively, receptively, without labeling or judging or comparing.  And when you look it, inhale its mystery, breathe in the spirit of sense, the smell of the wisdom of the Other Shore.\\"<br />Nor does Huxley reconfigure human nature with a literary sleight of hand, making everyone good little boys and girls. Every society has the possibility of creating a Hitler, a Tito or a Stalin, and so does Pala.  But it doesn't.  The Palanesians employ therapy \\"on all fronts at once\\" with an eye toward prevention over treatment. With detection, prevention, and four hundred milligrams of revelation, all problems are curable. Not the mention the love - which this island has in spades.<br />All told, Huxley has given us a wonder utopia and, perhaps more importantly, a thoroughgoing critique of Western Civilization. A must read for anybody who wants to discover their inner \\"suchness\\" and reach the Other Shore, where all is illuminated.  \\"Sunsets and death; death and therefore kisses; kisses and consequently birth and then death for yet another generation of sunset watchers.\\"of the Other Shore.\\"<br />Nor does Huxley reconfigure human nature with a literary sleight of hand, making everyone good little boys and girls.

Instead of writing a history of states and their stately heroes, Zinn provides a \\"bottom-up\\" view of history, where ordinary people and their actions become the focal point. As it turns out, ordinary people are much more interesting than Napoleon ever was.<br />In this book, you will see the conquistadors for what they really were - a bunch of gold-hungry, genocidal madmen conducting their plunder in the name of the Lord Almighty, and at the expense of anything and anyone in their way (Parental discretion is advised);<br />You will see what slavery and slave revolts were like from the perspective of slaves and those who participated in them (although perhaps it is simply impossible to convey the genuine experience of slavery);<br />You will discover how poor white laborers of the north were little better off than black slaves in the south - and therefore both had an equal interest in throwing off their capitalist slave masters;<br />You will witness the swindle and extermination of the great Indian Nations, despite continuous efforts at civilized diplomacy and treaty making;<br />You will understand WWI and WWII from the eyes of protesters, dissenters, bereaved mother, draft-dodgers and the young, drugged-up boys who died meaninglessly year after year in the vein hope of pushing a line forward another inch;<br />You will learn about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the fire bombings of Tokyo and Dresden, from the perspective of those who were incinerated;<br />You will understand how American foreign policy has willfully and consistently devastated and exploited the so-called Third World through corporate and military imperialist practices;<br />You will discover how the AFL, CIO, IWW and the American Communist party were serving the workers of America - and, conversely, how the House of Un-American Activities, the FBI, and their Republican caucus were working against them;<br />You will get a feel for how 3 million people of a former French colony, Vietnam, were bombed, gasoline-jellied, bombarded with grenades, machine-gunned and massacred (and for what?);<br />You will gain a new understanding and appreciation of the Civil Rights movement - a movement Zinn was part of - and its FBI suppression;<br />You will see the Power movements of the 60s, the Identity movements of the 70s and 80s, the Environmental movement of the 90s, and the primary conditions that sparked them all;<br />Finally, you will see how Republicans and Democrats are essentially the same, in that they both fund the war machine, deregulate industries for the sake of private profiteering, build prisons instead of schools, fail to protect the rights of workers, contribute to environmental degradation, and are corrupt to the hilt in scandals and political fraud.<br />If Hegel turned history into spirit unfolding, Zinn has made history the unfolding of an egalitarian ethos; where protesters, sit-down strikers, draft-dodgers, slaves, and revolutionaries of all stripes and creeds are the progressive heroes that demand good historical standing alongside traditional heroes like Jefferson and Lincoln.<br />For those of you who are interested in learning from the failures and success stories of those who fought for freedom and equality - America's two most-cherished values - this is your book. Zinn stands history on its head, leading us through the struggle as it evolved.<br />For those of you who are not down with freedom loving, democratic-minded radicals and the egalitarian ethos they strive for, this is not your book. It will only make you want to contribute more money to an already over-budgeted police state, in fear of the \\"coming revolt of the guards\\" - Zinn's closing reveille.<br />Despite its flaws, there is no single-volume history that provides this perspective.  Many have decried Zinn's\\"unpardonable\\" lack of citations, but any good historian knows that Zinn is not using hitherto unknown sources.  Bartoleme De Las Casa's reports are well-documented, Gar Alperovitz's study of the atomic bomb (The Decision to Use the Bomb) is much more controversial, and as with every other historical epoch Zinn covers.  There is no new material here.  Zinn simply furnishes the unmentionables other historians usually cover up or downplay - out of shame, out of disbelief, out of cognitive dissonance, who knows?<br />All told, Zinn provides with a picture of a beautiful tradition unfolding - a patriotic tradition.  This is the antiwar and egalitarian tradition of activism and dissent. If this struggle sounds appealing, you will most probably want to read everything Zinn has written, and thereby join in the unfolding of this tradition. That is how Zinn affected me, and that is what makes this book dangerous to those who emphasize the old way of doing history - the way separates history from politics.<br />A post September 11 note: This book does not give exhaustive coverage of America's involvement in the Middle East. However, after reading what Zinn has to say about American foreign policy in other areas of the world, you can make an educated guess as to how America comports itself in relation to a group of fragile, militarily-weak countries that harbor massive amounts of crude oil and natural gas. In any event, his new post-9-11 book, \\"Terrorism and War,\\" deals with this issue in specific.

In the appendix, the authors testify that this book is about the \\"greenest\\" on the market.  With soy-based inks and nearly 100 percent of the paper content comprised of post- and pre-consumer waste, the book is a monument to sustainable production.  Although they bemoan the \\"well traveled pulp\\" cover, no dioxins were co-produced alongside the book.  To prove the book really is this cool, they painstaking tracked the web of connections involved in its production as far back as possible.  After discussing every facet of the book, from guts and cover to printing, the only thing they were unable to determine was where half the cover's paper was produced.  In all, this post-production analysis was stunning.  The delicate web of causes and effects that entered into the books production should serve as a model to all those who would conceive the production of any product.  Ideally, we should strive for this kind holistic understanding of production, consumption, and disposal before products every leave the design table.The actual content of the book is just as salient.  What happens when millions of ordinary people like you and me go about our ordinary business, using lots of stuff?  What ecological \\"wakes\\" do they leave behind, rippling outward across the world?  This is the premise of the book, which is rather unassuming and commonsensical.  The answers, however, are anything but mundane and commonsensical.  The true stories of how things are made might leave you feeling overwhelmed or depressed.  You might think twice about throwing that lump of sugar into your coffee -- and not only because it could add a few extra pounds and put you at greater risk of heart disease.  You do so also in efforts to help restore the habitat of the Florida Everglades.  Did the profound disconnect sink in yet?  Not to worry, another 9 generic commodities with their own unique global \\"ripples\\" await you after picking up this book.  They include you morning coffee, the newspaper, your T-shirts, shoes, that computer, the bike (and the car), those French fries, the hamburger that preceded them, and also the cola which will wash it all down.  Although the imaginary North American whose daily consumptive routine this book tracks might not be you, do not then assume that these issues do not therefore concern you.  The fact is, the consolidated effects of this consumption are harming much more than the Florida Everglades.  They could potentially end all human reproduction.  Perhaps you should read that last sentence again.  We need to educate ourselves about this net ecological \\"wake\\" before the rooster tail of acid rain, rainforest destruction, ozone depletion, water depletion, air pollution, forest annihilation, energy exhaustion, pesticide inundation, sweatshop labor promotion, species extinction, waste production, monoculturalization, spiritual declination, heavy metal pollution creation, VOC smog accretion, and desertification leave us all wet and shivering in the cold.\\"Well, what am I supposed to do bury my car?\\" you wonder.  The book also offers hope.  Consumption, whether we like it or not, is in end inescapable.  Thus by understanding our impacts, seeking alternative solutions, educating the friends and the general public, and at the same time altering some our most unhealthy consumer habits, we can help move things in the right direction.  If you are looking for more in-depth suggestions along these lines, check out \\"The Better World Handbook\\" (2001).  It is my personal eco-bible.

Although messengers harkening bad news are often killed with the message, I must put this book in proper context.  In all honesty, it is not really about ecovillages, and it only touches upon the ecovillage movement in passing.  Although the book is provocative and unique, I was expecting something completely different.  What I got instead was the autobiography of Ross Jackson, with only 5 percent of the book devoted to what the title lead me to believe was the theme of this book:  namely, ecovillages.Don't get me wrong.  As other readers have pointed out, Ross Jackson's autobiography is incredibly provocative.  A brilliant financier and businessman, with an almost alter ego that dabbles in Indian mysticism, the early co-housing experiments of Denmark, and sustainable business, his curriculum vitae is fascinating.  But Jackson only discusses ecovillages and the ecovillage movement he helped create after running through 10 unrelated chapters of biographical gibberish.  He then goes on to drop the theme as soon as it is found, instead providing a less-than-adequate (although noble) critique of the global economy and free trade.  I say less than adequate, because other books -- like \\"The Case Against the Global Economy\\" and \\"Field Guide to the Global Economy\\" -- do a much better job along these lines.  Jackson also relies heavily on David Korten's \\"The Post-Corporate World,\\" when in fact that book would stand a better substitute for over three-quarters of the content of this book.  Why downgrade from Korten?  By far and away the most interesting aspect of the book was the last chapter, \\"The Era of Ecovillage,\\" which was a mini-sci-fi excursion into a future where ecovillages had become the norm.  Now that was cool!  I must admit.  In fact, it was so cool I hand copied the entire thing, edited out typos and punctuation errors, added footnotes for missing or obscure references, and sent it off to every compatriot I could muster.  But why did I have to wade through 115 pages (the book is only 128 pages) of seemingly contra-thematic biography and second-rate economic theory to find it?  It, like the short chapter of how he and a small cadre of friends started Gaiacorp and the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), should be posted on the GEN website.  At least, that would seem logical to me.  If you are interested in learning about ecovillages or the movement they have inspired, this book is a real letdown.  Had the only information I have received about ecovillages came through this book, I would be forced to conclude that there is no serious Ecovillage Movement to speak of, nor would I have any concrete understanding of what an actual ecovillage looks like, or how it functions, in real life.  For that, you would be well advised to check out the \\"Communities Directory: A Guide to Intentional Communities and Cooperative Living\\" ....  It is the most comprehensive, detailed, and resourceful book about ecovillages, co-housing, and the broader intentional community movement available at present.  If you just want the lowdown on GEN and ecovillages -- like, where they are and what they are about -- run a basic search on the internet the GEN homepage.  Although all my website postings have been scrubbed by the review editors, I suppose I should try again in sisyphus-like futility to nevertheless provide you with that quick info.  That said, see ... for concrete details on ecovillage movement.  On the other hand, if you are interesting in reading the autobiography of Ross Jackson, look no further.

For example, we all know that Saddam Hussein is a bad man, but most Americans are completely unaware that the US armed him in the 1980s, thereby giving him the firepower he needed to massacre tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds. When Americans are exposed to details like this it tends to produce a kind of cognitive dissonance, because this fact runs counter to everything we see on TV or read in newspapers.<br /><br />Moreover, not too many Americans know that the US and the UK are now engaged in deadly biological warfare against Iraq's citizenry: \\"The destruction of infrastructure and banning of imports to repair it has caused disease, malnutrition, and early death on a huge scale, including more than 500,000 children...\\" That is an average of 5,000 children dying each moth - a figure that blows the 9-11 tragedy out of the water (if one were so humane as to compare dead Iraqis with dead Americans).<br /><br />The US and Britain have taken the lead in blocking aid programs to Iraq under these UN-approved sanctions. For example, delaying approval for ambulances on the grounds that they could be used to transport troops, and barring insecticides for preventing the spread of disease and spare parts for sanitation systems. All the while, as innocent Iraqis (that is to say, women and children citizens) die and Saddam Hussein remains in power, the U.S. continues to purchase Iraqi oil - which under the \\"Oil for Food\\" program is now pennies on the dollar. A classic example of beat up the little guy and take the lunch money, US foreign policy is not as noble as our leaders would have us believe. Of course, thinking about this fact while filling up the SUV will only lead to more of that cognitive dissonance stuff.<br /><br />The story is much more detailed than this, and Chomsky's book helps flesh out some of these details that never seem to end up in mainstream media sources. But Chomsky does not limit his analysis to Iraq. In this book, he provides a global survey of the entire Rogue's Gallery - covering the Balkans, East Timor, Colombia, Cuba and Latin America. In the last few chapters, Chomsky also lends commentary and critique to European colonial history, imperialism, the rise of corporate capitalism, and the modern global economy.<br /><br />This is compact and potent Chomsky, a factual wrap sheet placed within the historical context of empire and conquest.

That is, most of our planetary brothers and sisters live in earthen houses that rely on renewable human labor and local resources like mud, straw, rock and tree. These houses are less energy intensive, more durable, and are often more esthetically pleasing than so-called &quot;modern&quot; homes, as this book shows.<br />&quot;The Art of Natural Building&quot; questions the environmental responsibility of a 5,000-sq-foot, 500,000-dollar house. As more and more people begin to make the kind of money it takes to buy their own American Dream house, we must question the feasibility our of contemporary building practices. Would it be possible cover the globe with modern homes?  Building companies certainly think so, but aside from what a project of this immensity what mean environmentally, the resources are simply not available.<br />There is simply not enough lumber, brick, cement, and processed material to go around. Our building industry would gladly sell us into oblivion if it meant a buck or two in the short-haul, but we need to get away from this kind of thinking. We also need to consider the environmental impacts of our current practices. What are these impacts?<br />As this book reminds us, buildings already account for one quarter of the world's wood harvest, two-fifths of its material and energy use, and one-six of its fresh water usage. In the past 100 years the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen 27 percent, one-quarter of which has come the burning of fossil fuels just to provide energy for buildings. During the same period, the world lost more than 20 percent of its forest. Quite simply, our building philosophy is not sustainable; and with a populaiton of 6 billion rising at an incredible rate every year, reconstruction of this philosophy becomes all the more timely and important.<br />We can start by dropping out of the rat race and getting our hands dirty. Natural building is much more affordable, durable, environmentally responsible and estheticly pleasing than the track homes and skyscrapers advancing on the horizon. We can also avoid the loan-mortgage game which weds us to unfulfilling job and Sisyphus-like existence. We can create spaces that are non-toxic, unique, and ecologically sound. And perhaps most importantly, we can reconnect with Earth and the spirit of artisanship.<br />Along with the philosophy, you will discover a veritable treasure trove of natural building styles and ideas, from the radically new and innovative - like concept &quot;earthship&quot; - to the ancient and elegant, such as the living roof pictured on the cover. Architects need not apply, nor must you be good with your hands to fashion your own natural house. I consider myself very fortunate to have seen this book before investing in a home of my own. Like many people, I might have ended up working the rest of my life to pay for &quot;a house without a clue.&quot;<br />By far and away, this is one of the most important books I have ever read. Philosophers dabble with theories of justice, beauty and truth, but with this book you will discover how all of these ideas can be BUILT into the very structure and fabric of your life. You will discover the ethics and aesthetics of building design and ecological living.<br />Filled to the brim with great references, links and some amazing photographs to stimulate your right brain, &quot;The Art of Natural Building&quot; is a must for anybody interested in saving the planet and saving a little money at the same time.

US	38685946	R1D40VLT3N6NPW	0679775439	730850906	The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel	Books	5	174	184	N	N	Buried in Kanji, Wrapped in Rice Paper	I should say that half way through The Wind-Up Bird, I read over some reviews to get a feel for what other people think.  Unfortunately, many were intent on giving the story away.  Quite simply, it is best not to know the story line in advance.  This is not a book one could possibly rationalize and understand without having first experienced it.  More to the point, such analysis will only detract from the experience of reading the book in the first place.<br />Encountering The Wind-Up-Bird Chronicle is like encountering a delicate origami crane for the first time.  From the very beginning, you wonder how it got in that shape.  You wish to know the secret of its structure.  To do so, you must work at it slowly and carefully, undoing each fold with the utmost care and caution in order to discover the pain-staking sequence that led to its beautifully complex and elegant shape.  Reading The Wind-Up-Bird is like unfolding a bigger, more-complex crane -- so complex in fact that you might be confused when the entire thing is laid out in front of you, creases spanning the entire page.  If you are like me, you might spend weeks or months trying to figure out how to put that crane back together.<br />Without giving too much away, allow me to share some of the things that engaged and enwrapped me:<br />* The possibility that every experience in our life contains deep and profound philosophical meaning.<br />* Discovering the mysterious nature of life and the vagaries of chance fate; realizing that the place we inhabit and the family we are born into are givens that guide us, not things we can ultimately choose.<br />* Questioning the extent to which we can fully understand other people -- from the man why walks by us in the street to the significant other who sleeps on the other side of our bed.<br />* Realizing the deep and intricate continuity between dreams and waking life.  More to the point, discovering how the two realities affect each other and blend together in a seamless fabric called reality.<br />* The possibility that our most profound insights about life might only be found in the bottom of a dry well in a deep meditative, trance-like state.<br />* Finally, the book made realize that a story is quite possibly the best tool with which to convey historical reality.  Sounds strange, I'm sure, but after doing a lot of deep research about Japan's involvement in Manchuria during WWII, Murakami is perhaps in the best possible position to give voice to what is often omitted from non-fiction historical texts, simply because history (which is almost infinite) is never fully uncovered  or told by finite, fallible and imperfect historians.<br />Hmm, I suppose I should discuss names a bit too.  All Japanese names have meaning as written in kanji.  Tanaka means 'in the rice field'.  Kobayashi means 'small forest'.  O'Hara means 'big field'.  It wasn't until the entrance of Mr. Ushikawa (bull river) that I remembered this and began to wonder how each character's name was written in the original Japanese version.  Indeed, Mr. Ushikawa's speaks openly about the significance of his name at one point.  As he says, he sort of grew to fit the name, instead of the name growing to fit him.<br />The main character's name is also significant, but more so when he comes to known as \\"Mr. Wind-Up-Bird.\\"  (I'll leave that one to you.)  Mr. Wind-Up-Bird and Mr. Ushikawa made me realize that I might be missing some important context, so I decided to research every name that appears in the book.  It wasn't hard for a man in my position.  After buying a Japanese edition in Tokyo, I spent a good hour talking over the names with a kind English-sensei that just happened to be handy.  From this, I was able to flesh out many hidden nuances.  One of the character's names, a certain Noboru Wataya, turned out to be of critical significance.<br />Noboru Wataya's first name was written in katakana in the Japanese version, but any Japanese reader would know that \\"noboru\\" has two corresponding kanji:  One means \\"to rise\\" and the other means \\"to climb.\\"  The kanji representing \\"to rise\\" has the further significance of pictographically representing a rising sun, and thus in Japan it is often referred to \\"taiyo noboru\\" -- taiyo meaning sun.  Although written without a corresponding kanji, Noboru implies something moving up -- quite possibly sun itself, and thus the very symbol of the Japanese people.<br />The last name, Wataya, appears in kanji, and it simply means cotton valley.  Not just any valley, though.  It has the connotation of a hidden, secret or mystical valley.  The image of shrouded Shangri-La comes to mind.  While reading the book, it is important remember that Noboru Wataya might be rising or climbing something in both the literal and figurative sense of the term.  Is he rising in the social ranks, or perhaps climbing the social ladder?  Again, I'll leave that to you.  Of particular note, though, is the fact that Wataya is not a common Japanese name.  According to my source, it is extremely rare, if anybody of Japanese origin bears the name at all.  All of this overlaps very with the myterious and unique character of Noboru Wataya himself, so I was glad to have gotten the scoop.<br />I will say no more about the book, because it is simply too complex to unravel in a review like this.  If you want to know whether or not the book is for you, try reading into it for a good ten minutes.  It is amazing how much you can get from ten short minutes if you really invest your attention.  I hope you find this book as intoxicating and rewarding as I did.  Feel free to write me and let me know either way.

Unlike any other study, it gives a unique snapshot of the social, economic, and environmental trends that determine the quality of our lives and the future of our children's lives. It answers the question, \\"Where has development brought us?\\" And although we might not want to hear the answer, it is necessary if we wish to steer ourselves in the right direction. To quote the introduction, \\"a candied appraisal reveals disparities between rich and poor, mounting health challenges, battered ecosystems, and persistent social and political conflicts.\\" More specifically, we see that the global temperature is rising; forests are fading; pesticide use is skyrocketing (as are pesticide-resistant pests); soda beverage drinking is up as with its concomitants, obesity and diabetes, and food-borne illness is widespread, among other things to numerous to mention. The &quot;key indicators&quot; Vital Signs focuses on are food and agricultural trends, energy trends, atmospheric trends, economic trends, transportation trends, communication trends, health and social trends, and finally military trends. The second half of this slim, compact, hard-hitting book focuses on &quot;special issues.&quot; These include environmental features (like the deterioration of farmland and the increase of &quot;unseen toxic wastes&quot;), economy and finance features (from foreign spending to the cruise industry), resource economic features (the biotech and water issues, for example), health features (such as asthma and food-borne illness), social features (like persisting poverty and voter decline), and military features - in particularly, progress against landmines. As you can the see, the scope of the book is vast, but the presentation is clean and seamless.  It won't bog you down and intimidate.  A veritable resource treasure house.

In any event, whether you want to understand Dewey's philosophical center or simply get a quick, concise overview of progressive, experience-based educational theory, this would be the book to start with.  However, you might want to check out _John Dewey: The Later Works, 1938-1939_, edited by Jo A. Boydston. It not only contains \\"Experience and Education,\\" but also \\"Freedom and Culture,\\" \\"Theory of Valuation,\\" and a handful of other essays.

The book is not a tree.  Instead of being made from wood pulp or cotton fiber, it is composed of plastic resins and inorganic fills, so that we don't have to cut down our precious and dwindling forests to produce \\"so humble and transient a substance as paper.\\"<br />Nor is this waterproof (yes, waterproof) \\"durabook\\" composed of any hazardous materials, unlike the computer we both use/d to interface right here and now.  It is a prototype of a &quot;technical nutrient&quot; book, meaning it can be broken down and &quot;circulated infinitely in industrial cycles--made and remade as 'paper' and other products.&quot;<br />Many products are not so environmentally friendly or healthy as this book, though.  The chair you plopped down in to read this probably contain \\"mutagenic materials [what are those?], heavy metals, dangerous chemicals, and dyes that are often labeled hazardous by regulators--except when they are presented and sold\\" to you.  And your computer?  It contains \\"a thousand of different materials, including toxic gases, toxic metals (such as cadmium, lead and mercury), acids, plastics, chlorinated and brominted substances,\\" and many other additives.<br />As the authors ask, is the way we make and package things sensible?  Is it even necessary?  What were the designers at the toy company thinking when they constructed your baby's plastic rattle--the one she's got in her mouth right now--out of PVC plastic, which contains \\"phthalates, known to cause liver cancer in animals (and suspected to cause endocrine disruption), along with toxic dyes, lubricants, antioxidants, and ultraviolet stabilizers\\"?  Could they have been thinking about anything other than the bottom line?  It's doubtful.<br />But according to these authors, commerce is about to experience a new day, a way of making things that transcends old Industrial Revolution modes of extraction, manufacture, and disposal that are so harmful for the planet.  With this book, they envision a \\"New Industrial Revolution,\\" where waste becomes &quot;food,&quot; consumption okay, and commerce is as natural and cyclic as the growth process of a sequoia tree.<br />You might find a few patchy spots and loopy reasoning by the time you've finished the book, but its lucid vision of the future is awe-inspiring.  And unlike Marxian revolutionaries, the authors of this book do not propose that we use whatever means are necessary to reach our ideological end-goal.  The book itself is living proof of the fact that commercial ends must not be sacrificed to the means employed getting there.<br />All in all, a fine book--a book you will want to see, smell and touch.  Indeed, if you are like me you might even want to play with it:  marking it with different types of pens and pencils, floating it in the bathtub, boiling it, or trying to burn it (not a good idea).  It's a good read, and good fun for cavemen.lution modes of extraction, manufacture, and disposal that are so harmful for the planet.

Unlike any other author writing on this touchy subject, author Dr. Helen Caldicott highlights the mob-like connections between business and government, without paying head to the feathers she would be ruffling. And her staid, objective assessment of what nuclear winter actually means for the human body is extremely disturbing and important. Some reviewers have labeled her unpatriotic and conspiratorial, without a leg of fact to stand on. This is no mere diatribe, but a thoroughly researched and well-documented analysis of the modern Nuclear Era - an era in which, even here in the US, nuclear spending is on the rise, while India and Pakistan stand poised at hair-trigger alert. It is an era in which Bush and his cabinet have backed out of and boycotted the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty as well as the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, and are currently debating the use of small-scale nuclear weapons in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is an era in which investors can depend on a considerable appreciation of defense stocks, to say the least. Thus, when people accuse her of \\"anti-Americanism\\" and \\"emotional outbursts\\" we should stop and wonder who these people are and where their money is, for there is nothing in this book but an unbridled commitment to truth and an untiring commitment to public health and safety.

Then you read many credible sources citing the death of over one million innocent people (including some 5oo,ooo children) as a result of these sanctions.  This makes you cringe a little more, but you still wonder about the reality of it all.  Although this book does not furnish any photos of children with one mutant eye bulging out their head from exposure to depleted uranium radiation, it does nonetheless paint an accurate picture of the current situation.  (Btw, I was exposed to footage of \\"dumpster babies\\" and mutant children in Japan, so you can take my word when I say that you wouldn't want to see such photos anyway.)  Moreover, the book will provide you with the most up-to-date information about the sanctions available in print.  If Iraq, biological warfare or sanctions are issues that interests you, this book is not to be passed up.	2002-06-21

It traces hem's historical roots, details the hundreds of uses of hemp, explains the historical legal underpinnings of hemp's brush in with the law, examines the global hemp industry, and shows hemp in the modern marketplace.  In effect, this book provides readers with the most factual, historically comprehensive, and even-handed presentation of this controversial crop to date.  To give an understanding of how useful and potentially revolutionary this crop is, allow me to quote one of my favorite parts of the book:<br />\\"So imagine that one day within the next ten years, you wake up in a house whose walls, roof, flooring, insulation, and paint are derived of hemp.  You feel great after sleeping on your hemp-stuffed mattress, covered with soft linens spun from hemp fiber.  Your feet sink into the hemp carpeting as you get out of bed and open the hemp drapes.  It's a beautiful morning.<br />\\"You jump into the shower, where you soap, shampoo, and hair conditioner made from hemp.  You step out onto the hemp bath mat, drying yourself with a superabsorbent hemp towel.  You clean your ears with H-Tips (better than the old cotton swabs), and apply hemp-oil lotion, moisturizer, and lip balm.  You make a mental note to buy some more hemp toilet paper, recalling how it wasn't too long ago that we were still cutting down centuries-old trees just to flush them away.<br />\\"Opening your closet, you dress in hemp jeans, shirt, and jacket; put on hemp socks and shoes; tie the hemp laces; and grab your hemp wallet, which holds checks and currency printed on hemp paper.<br />\\"You're hungry, so you walk into the kitchen with its hemp-based linoleum floor.  You make some wheat-and-hemp-flower toast, and pour a glass of fresh, organic hemp milk.  After eating, you make a salad with hemp-oil dressing to take to work.  Then you wash your dishes, using hemp-oil dish soap and a hemp pot-scrubber, and put the dishes away in a cabinet built of hemp fiberboard.  Sitting down on the hemp-framed and upholstered couch, you glance at a newspaper printed with hemp ink on hemp recycled paper, and learn that the hemp industry is now the largest agribusiness and the major job provider in your state.  You turn on the stereo, which sits on a hemp fiberboard cabinet, and listen as music vibrates from speakers also made from hemp fiberboard.  They contain specialty hemp paper for the speaker cones and are covered with black hempen cloth.<br />\\"Leaving the house for work, you open the door of your car, built of strong, lightweight composites that include hemp.  Relaxing into the driver's seat, luxuriously upholstered with hemp textiles, you rest your feet on floor mats that look like rubber but are made from hemp.  As you drive to your job at the new hemp-fiber processing facility, you pass farmers harvesting some of the locally grown hemp that is revitalizing your community's rural economy.\\"<br />A beautiful morning indeed, but it would be even more beautiful if you knew how environmentally friendly and healthy your new hempen life actually is.  The rubber-like mats in your hemp mobile are all natural and 100 per cent biodegradable; the roots of the hemp plants that line the fields of your county help enrich and solidify much-needed topsoil and therefore increase the yield of other rotational crops.  You smile while spreading hempseed hummus on your hemp-wheat toast knowing it is the single most complete source of non-animal protein on the planet - and tastes much better than tofu.  The smile increases as you pour hemp oil on your salad, knowing it is high in essential fatty acids that help you think better, boost your immune system, decrease your chances of cancer, and reduce the risk of high blood pressure, platelet coagulation, and hardening of the arteries.  Lastly, before heading off to work, you opt for your hemp skateboard instead of the hemp mobile, as itis a brilliant, bright and sunny day.<br />The fact of the matter is, this beautiful morning has no imaginative end.  The only thing keeping us from achieving the dawn of a new tomorrow is our monopoly cotton and paper industries, and a government which seems to be supporting those industries by restricting and limiting hemp production permits and also by unleashing the DEA on would-be hemp producers (despite the fact that it has NEVER been illegal to grow hemp in America).  Whatever you want to know about hemp is in this book.  A must read., as it is a brilliant, bright and sunny day.<br />The fact of the matter is, this beautiful morning has no imaginative end.

Such is certainly the case with this Cannabis Sativa, as most of the American people - especially the DEA - seem to have trouble understanding the practical value of industrial hemp _and_ the spiritual and medicinal value of its psychoactive sister, Marijuana.  I say America, because the rest of the Western World is already catching on (hemp is being grown in Canada in and all over Europe now), whereas China, Japan, and many other eastern countries never forgotten this miracle crop.  Yes, miracle crop.  Hemp can be put to just about any use:  It can be made into wood, paper, clothing, fiberglass, canvas, twine, rope, soap, shampoo, cosmetics, oils, paints, inks, putty, and coatings.  It is also perhaps the most important food crop, as it stands supreme as the planet's single most nutritious source of protein and essential fatty acids.  It can even be made into auto fuel!!  (Visit Colorado's Rocky Mountain Institute's website for information on this long-known property of many carbohydrates.)  Moreover, hemp treads much lighter on the planet, as it usually does not require pesticides or herbicides (indeed, it is used as natural herbicide); and its fast-growing roots and self-mulching leaves can even rejuvenate undernourished and eroding soils.  In effect, by converting to hemp paper and woods products instead of felling old growth and dwindling indigenous rain forests, and furthermore by using hemp to retain soil composition in areas were erosion is advancing (hemp can grow just about anywhere), we could begin to restore declining ecosystems.  Without understatement, hemp could lend a much-needed hand in saving the planet.  This book was a real eye-opener.  In terms of price, expediency and insight you can't go wrong.	2002-06-20

Jeremy St. Clair's 40 page \\"Seatle Diary\\" alone makes the book worthy of reading.  Perhaps the best piece of journalism to emerge from the growing body of Seatle stories.  Two clips involving WTO delegates (one pounching a black lady in the face, another waving his revolver at a protestor baracade) utterly blew me away.  And in the spirit of the lively and diverse protesters, the book is also funny at times, as when a South Central LA youth named Thomas replies to St. Clair's question, \\"Why are you here?\\" He answers: \\"I like turtles and I hate that ... Bill Gates.\\" To which Sinclair replies, \\"Good enough for me.\\"  You won't be able to put the book down.  It has a very genuine, honest and human feel.  Along the way, you will run into Brower, the famous French cheese-maker Jose Bove, some interesting college professors, Sierra Club's Carl Pope, many of the so-called \\"anarchists\\" which every major media venue categorized all protestors as, and many other important people who turned out for the \\"Battle in Seatle.\\"  The book will not only give you a comprehensive understanding of the issues surrounding the protests and the subsequent media storm, it will also make you feel like you were there.  St. Clair's writing is that good.	2002-06-17

For most of us who grew up inside a public educational institution, it is difficult to imagine alternatives. Indeed, it may difficult to imagine anything at all. After twelve (in my case 19) years of absract inundation, most of us have lost the trees in a forest of abstractions. We inhabit a vacuous matrix of unispired, cynical defeatism, where teachers can't level with us as human beings and test questions bear no resemblance to reality. Until graduation day, that is.  Then the world opens up before us, free for the plunder of active, self-interested engagement. What if we had never left that world from start? What if from birth to grave our lives were naturally interesting and piquant? What if we didn't educate ourselves for the test, but instead focused on the context of our life and followed our natural curiosities? Einstein (a college drop-out) certainly thought this was the right approach to education: \\"It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet strangle the holy curiosity of inquiry.\\" This book a refreshing, imaginative, and likewise extremely practical guide to context-driven education. All my life I had been vexed with the notion that contemporary education is utterly wrongheaded and thwarting, but until now I had never had the language or facts to back up my intuitive, gut feeling. Whether you are thinking of making the great experimental leap and homeschooling your kids, or whether you simply want to better understand how to get the most out of your local educational institution, this book is essential. Although you cannot relive the wasted years, it will send you in the right direction for future learning, and help you give your children an education that will truly unlock their deepest potential. Isn't that what education is supposed to be about:  unlocking our native potential and stimulating genuine growth? With this book the relationship between information and the world becomes transparent again, as it should have been from the very beginning.it should have been from the very beginning.	2002-06-16

Like the last book, \\"You Are Being Lied Too,\\" there is something here for everyone. First of all, the cast of contributing disinfobots (a term which refers to Disinfo contributors and readers alike) cuts across the board: acclaimed American historian Howard Zinn; founder of Adbusters Kalle Lasn (visit his website at [...] author best-seller \\"No Logo,\\" Naomi Klein; award-winning journalist, Greg Palast; author and environmentalist, James Ridgeway; and many many others.<br />In this book, you will learn about everything-from Olympic Industry Mythology to the underlying conspiracy evidence of the 9-11 attacks. You will discover - as you never have before - such subjects as: pornography, prostitution, labor history, mushroom clouds, Pan Am flight 103, Waco, nuclear power, interesting true crime stories, globalization's dirty money, TV addiction, domestic violence, religion and feminism, the European Union, corporate watchdogs, Delta Force and Army Ranger Commando ops, drug companies, Osama Bin Laden, \\"Kadaffi,\\" and the emergence of China as global economic big boy, among other things.<br />Perhaps the best thing about this book is not its depth and range - neither of which are lacking - but its ability to unearth new facts and perspectives, and present them in straight-forward, no-nonsense language. If you are trying to break through the mainstream \\"multimedia megaplexed info-flood\\" and discover an alternative (and equally believable) version of what is real, this latest disinfo guidebook will serve as a terrific companion. By simply reading the book, you too will become a disinfobot.

We sometimes catch a glimpse of \\"anarchist\\" protesters and heads of state at global economic summits, but many of us lack a comprehensive view of the process of globalization.  Depending on what papers you read and how closely you read them, your view of globalization may be more or less informed, more or less ideologically biased, but is most probably lacking in some aspect.  This book brings it all together in a timely and accurate historical tale.  Hertz starts by identifying certain realities and discontents:  corporations getting larger and larger everyday through mega-mergers; a widening gap between the rich Haves and the poor Have-nots; fewer and fewer people turning out to vote, as more and more people, from Seattle to Genoa, hit the streets in protest of profligate politics and out-of-control business.  She then focuses on one of the major causes of these problems:  the government's mad-dash to \\"liberalize\\" and deregulate their control of commerce and industry.  In other words, the private sector is set free and the state withers away in every capacity -- except insofar as campaign and lobby contributions purchase the last of our \\"representative\\" influence in the political sphere.  The picture this book paints is nothing less than the hijacking of our democratic political heritage by large, increasing global corporations who pay no homage to local people, public health, labor rights, environmental degradation or national sovereignty -- and, conversely, the shrinkage of our government to the role of a corporate nanny, whose primary function would appear to begging large corporations not to flee to the Third World with large, tax-fed subsidies and lax environmental codes.  Very concisely worded, accurately and appropriately referenced, the book will serve as a solid companion to anybody interested in understanding where the last 50 years of scandal-ridden politics and unfettered business have landed us.  By no coincidence was \\"The Silent Takeover\\" The Sunday Times' book of the year and a best seller in England.  Apparently, it has now been translated into French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Korean, Portuguese and Japanese.Times' book of the year and a best seller in England.

Without realizing it, we have put ourselves in grave peril, and ironically enough it is a cadre of scientists (life scientists, that is, ecologists and biologists) who are sounding the wake-up call -- ironic because it was their ilk, the chemists and scientific industrialists, who brought us pesticides, PCBs, and other toxic substances in the first place.  The sad fact is, we all have these substances in our body now.  There is no way to escape the new, chemicalized environment we have constructed.  So in other words, there is no getting off this joy ride.  That said, if you are interested in learning about natural detoxification processes, read \\"Hormone Deception\\" (Berkson, 2000).  There is a lot of useful information in there, as well as a chapter about how diet and excercise can help keep these substnaces at lower levels by speeding up and aiding the body's natural detoxification processes.  In a nutshell, she suggested to eating green, yellow and red veggies, taking in a lot of protein (nuts and seeds work fine for veggetarians), getting a regular dose of antioxidents, and excercising until you sweat for 30 minutes six days a week.

They would rather he simply kept to pure economics, facts and theories, and dump the New Age spin he picked up from biologist Mae-Wan Ho.  They were hoping that \\"The Post-Corporate World\\" would simply be Part II of his last sizzler, \\"When Corporations Ruled the World.\\"  They see the soft-headed ecological metaphor as a meaningless distraction that will only serve the interests of the enemy -- i.e., number-crunching CEOs, who have no time (after all, time is money) for ecological quackery.<br />In my opinion, \\"When Corporations Ruled the World\\" does not need a sequel.  It did the job perfectly.  Nor will taking a simply factual stand against the global corporate juggernaut fundamentally alter things.  This is what Korten is driving at in his book.  He believees we need to understand the world on radically different terms.  We need to approach reality with a new story and a new bag of metaphors -- because the old ones have not been doing the job.  If you simply want a truckload of facts disavowing capitalism's ability to meet human needs (and by that, I mean all humans -- not just 1 percent of the population), read his first book.  It will not only alarm you, but it will arm you to the hilt with anti-corporate firepower for the next time you enter a debate on capitalism's merits.  If you want a richer analysis of the inherent paradoxes of capitalism, and a more thorough understanding of what is necessary to remedy the current situation, read this book.  The books serve two different functions:  The last book was by and large descriptive, whereas this book is heavy on prescription.<br />Despite what our hard-headed, number-crunching economists might tell you, capitalism is indeed a lot like a cancer.  \\"Cancer occurs when genetic damage causes a cell to forget that it is part of a larger body, the healthy function of which is essential to its own survival.  The cell begins to seek its own growth without regard to the consequences for the whole, and ultimately destroys the body that feeds it.  As I came to learn more about the course of cancer's development within the body, I cam to realize that the reference to capitalism as a cancer is less a metaphor than a clinical diagnosis of a pathology to which market economic are prone in the absence of adequate citizen and governmental oversight.\\"<br />In her ground-breaking book, \\"If You Love This Planet: A Plan to Heal the Earth,\\" the now-famous physicist Helen Caldicott wrote, \\"as a physician I examine the dying planet as do a dying patient.  The earth has a natural system of interacting homeostatic mechanisms similar to the human body's.  If one system is diseased, like the ozone layer, then other systems develop abnormalities in function-the crops will die, the plankton will be damaged, and the eyes of all creatures on the planet will become diseased and vision impaired.<br />\\"We must have the tenacity and courage to examine the various disease processes afflicting our planetary home.  But an accurate and meticulous diagnosis is not enough.  We never cure patients by announcing that they are suffering from meningococcal meningitis or cancer of the bladder.  Unless we are prepared to look further for the cause, or etiology, of the disease process, the patient will not be cured.  Once we have elucidated the etiology, we can prescribe appropriate treatments.\\" (Caldicott, 1991)<br />As you can see, Korton was not the first person to understand our world as a network of interrelated systems that function much like the human body and other ecological systems.  But with this book Korton successfully assays the disease of our capitalist system, elucidates its causes (or etiology) and prescribes an appropriate treatment.  In the truest sense of the word, Korten is here acting as a Ph.D (read, doctor) of economics, and capitalism -- as well as your mind and its metaphors -- are the patient.<br />True, the book does have a more \\"holistic\\" flavor, as one reviewer put it, but don't let that scare you away.  The book has received unanimously high marks form all reveiwers.  From consumers to CEOs, everyone profits from reading this book.\\"holistic\\" flavor, as one reviewer put it, but don't let that scare you away.

It takes energy from outside (capital, labor, raw materials) and transforms it in various ways.

With this book, you will see how businesses (both big and small) can \\"make money like the bee.\\"<br />An example:  Meet Judy Wicks, \\"a woman of about 50 with a mane of snow-white hair,\\" owner and proprietor of White Dog Cafe and business revolutionary extraordinaire. White dog is a full-service restaurant in the university disctrict of Philadelphia that serves cruelty-free meats, organically raised produce, non-GE soy and corn oils, as well as Table Talks on the War on Drugs, the court decision to electe Bush, the GE debate, and much much more. White Dog Cafe is a $5 million grossing business cooperative (so you can bet the food is delicious), where the head cook makes the same salary as Wicks:  about $65,000 a year, \\"a fine and comfortable living for a single parent with two college-age children.\\" Instead of investing her extram money in expansion, Wicks choses to invest in her employees, her community, and the natural environment. White Dog runs mentoring programs, inner-city tours, holds community dances, buys local produce, offers jobs to struggling youth, provides scholarships for workers, and is active with many other local organizations, like the Chef's Collaborative 2000. In accord with her mission statement, Wicks runs her business for the benefit of her customers, the community, her employees, and the natural world. As she says, \\"small businesses are one of the plant's most wonderful means of *serving* and doing good.\\"<br />White Dog Cafe is but one of many of positive examples of people are beginning to live together harmoniously with themselves and the environment. This book will introduce to revolutionary loggers, farmers, and other local peoples from all over the planet who show \\"again and again that the people in the best position to know what will really work over the long term in a given area are locals committed to that area\\" - that is, the same people who have a long-term interest in making sure that the area remains healthy. This book is a must read for anybody, from parents to revolutionaries. Whether you are deep ecologist or quid chewing lumberjack, you will find a niche in this book. There is something for everyone. Personally, I found it to be an indispensible resource, filled with inspiring new ideas that I hope to incorporate into my life.

The book is straight forward, well-researched, and filled with interesting personal anecdotes, as well as many tantelizing tid bits from the anals of military history.  More than anything, the book makes a good point: Killing has become too easy. Indeed, as Grossman shows us, the threshold for killing both in and outside of the military machine has been lowered considerably.  For a small but rising number of people living inside the Holleywood/video game Western media machine, killing has become a natural, psychologically conditioned response, through inundation and repetition.  If you finish the book all the way to the end - \\"Killing In America: What Are We Doing to Our Children?\\" - you will realize that book is nothing less than a wake-up call.  I consider myself a democratic progressive, with extreme views on personal freedom and civil liberty, but the level of violence that we have come to live with and accept (unconsciously) in the media and society in general is far too much for our fragile psyches.  Although by no means the last word on the subject, this book is an important step in understanding the rash of school shootings now plaguing America and other highly industrialized Western media-saturated environments around the world.	2002-05-11

Worse than useless, it will actually distract you from answering the question posed by the title.  More to the point, it's full of disinformation.<br /><br />I was hoping that But Was It Just would be a highly informative debate about the war. Instead, the book turned out to be very scant on facts, filled with abstract and vague generalizations and hypothetical examples of what might be considered just in the abstract, philosophical sense of the term.<br /><br />You might find this book interesting if you care what Saint Thomas Aquinas said about just warfare, but who in their right mind would defer to the six moral criteria of jus ad bellum when evaluating an international conflict?  These are ivory tower issues that have nothing to do with the Gulf War in specific, nor justice in general.<br /><br />Even when the book does attempt to paint an objective picture of what happened, though, it fails miserably. \\"The bombs were 'smart' and the pilots morally sensitive.... And it does appear that direct civilian casualties were kept fairly low: in this sense, at least, the air war was unprecedented.\\" This is, quite matter of factly, a steaming load of balderdash.<br /><br />The truth is that the air war was devastating. As William Blum shows in his brilliantly researched book, Killing Hope, Operation Desert Storm was the equivalent of a veritable massacre. Thousands of civilians were killed - smartly or otherwise - and the motives were downright dirty. Black gold dirty. Says George Bush Sr., \\"Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom, and the freedom of friendly countries around the world still suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell in the hands of that one man, Saddam Hussein\\" (Blum, 1995).<br /><br />Other critics of the war, like Noam Chomsky, have also laid out serious indictments of American motives. In his Rogue States, Chomsky provides solid evidence that top US officials were giving Iraq mixed signals, most likely in an attempt to nettle a Kuwait invasion. However, a discussion of motives can only lead us so far in understanding the (in)justice of the Gulf War. One must also pay close attention to actual consequences that ensued.<br /><br />As this book was written 1992, discussion of US-imposed sanctions is not up-to-date. Currently, these sanctions have lead to the death of over 1.5 million civilians (500,000 of those being children under the age of five). There is also no discussion of depleted uranium radiation illness, which has caused Iraq's leukemia rates to skyrocket into the number one slot. See Arnove's Iraq Under Siege for a thorough discussion of these issues.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning about the Gulf War, which is in my opinion the first step in determining whether or not it was just, Was It Just is of no help. This book is little more than a distraction.<br /><br />In the end I am left to wonder, is this perhaps one of the many books the CIA publishes every year in an effort to convince the nation its foreign policy is legit?<br /><br />Would have given it zero stars if the program allowed.invasion.

Cooper.  Personally, I would save your [money] and just buy this.  I have read and reviewed many other Platonic texts, but I really don't think you need anything else.  This is the irreducible core of Platonic Goodness.<br />THE TRIAL AND DEATH OF SOCRATES is a compilation four dialogues:  the \\"Euthyphro,\\" the \\"Apology,\\" \\"Crito,\\" and the \\"Phaedo\\".  As the title clearly states, these four dialogues convey the story - and philosophical debate - that surrounded Socates' trial and death.  In these dialogues we find Socrates defending the righteousness of his actions and views, and tearing away at his prosecutors with the skill of expert lawyer.  His only weapon being the truth.<br />In spite of, or perhaps because these four dialogues were written while Plato was still a middle-aged man (as opposed to the \\"Republic\\" and the \\"Laws,\\" which are thought to be his more formulated philosophical expressions), they absolutely sizzle.  The text bleeds with life, and so-called Socratic method of endless penetrating questions is here exemplified in the most dire of occasions - Socrates defense against the State of Athens.<br />It is in these dialogues that Plato expresses the core of philosopohy:  a committment to truth, beauty and justice, and the the supreme tenent:  \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\"  That said, if you still yearn for more Plato after reading these dialogues, grab a copy of Allan Bloom's translation of THE REPUBLIC.  It is currently the best English translation available, and you will still be saving [money] over an edition of Plato's complete works.	2002-05-10

Here is a summary of its good points:<br />1) All words come with extremely useful example sentences.  This feature along is valuable beyond comparison.  I can't tell you how many practical expressions I gleaned from this book.<br />2) All Kanji are spelled out in Furigana (Hiragana), so you will never get lost.  This is such an important feature, as looking up Kanji seperately is a difficult, time-consuming task that will drive you crazy.<br />3) It's extremely compact and durable, so you can take with you anywhere without fear of damaging it.  The lather binding makes it practically indestructable.  After using mine everyday for over three years now, it is still good as new.<br />4)  Although compact, the selection is superb, and the translations are very clear and modern (perhaps the best feature of this dictionary).  Although Japanese is full of difficult idioms and metaphors, this dictionary is both clear and accessible.<br />For those you who are not yet compitent with Hiragana and Katagana, Kodansha also makes a &quot;Roma-ji&quot; version (aka, an English version) which I highly recommend.  This version is also useful for those who are already compitent in the Kana, because entries are listed in alphabetically order, as opposed to Kana order (a, i, u, e, o, etc); and the example sentences are written in both Roma-ji and Japanese, with their corresponding English translations.<br />Whether you buy the Furigana or Romaji edition, you will not be disappointed.  Kodansha is the best out there, hands down.	2002-05-10

In an attempt to express some higher notion of Being or Greekness, many of the older translations are abosolutely horrible. They read worse than the King James version of the Bible. I cannot stress how important fresh translations are. Believe it or not, THEY MAKE THE TEXT. If you don't believe me, find a cheap thrift edition of any dialogue published in the 70s and compare it to this book - the difference will baffle you.<br /><br />This edition has the further virtue of containing many apocraphal dialogues that Plato may or may not have written: including the Minos, Epinomis, Demodocus, Eryxias, and Axiochus. Most rigorous Plato scholars now deny that these dialogues were written by Plato, but they are nevertheless Socratic in form or style. And regardless of who wrote them, they are valuable expositions on Truth, Beauty and Goodness in their own right. Thus, the editor been conveniently added them.<br /><br />Moreover, this edition has good introductions. I am not a big fan of introductions that dabble in exegetical interpretation, as most readers would rather form their own interpretations and opinions. However, when introductions attempt to contextualize the text, explain the translation, or locate the text historically, they can be helpful. Cooper's introductions are just that. They clarify translation issues that might concern a serious Plato scholar who never learned Ancient Greek. (I tried and quit.) For an example of what you don't want in a Plato introduction, see The Collected Dialogues of Plato. Editor Edith Hamilton's introductions might well have been written by a martian.<br /><br />As for the actual content of the text, there is no substitute. Plato is perhaps the most influencial philosopher who ever lived.  Alfred North Whitehead said something to the effect of \\"Every philosopher since Plato has merely been a footnote to his writing.\\" And when you his works, you will no doubt discover that Whitehead was right - all philosophical disscussions lead back to the fountainhead, Plato. I would not go so far as to say that Plato was the first and last word in philosophy, but his style, power, and inquisitive nature have never since been duplicated. More so than than many contemporary philosophers, his thought is still relevent.<br /><br />Lastly, this book has is the complete package. You can spend a lot of time and money hunting down individual dialogues, but why waste your time? After reading the Apology, the Crito and the Phaedo, you will surely want to continue on to the Republic and many of his other famous dialogues.

According to Csikszen (for short), flow is more or less being a state of involvement with an an activity - work, sports, whatever - to the point where everything else it tuned out. Csikszen even goes so far as to say that this is in fact happiness.<br />I have various issues with this book. For one, it is boring. Csikszen's concept is flow is interesting for about five pages, and then it starts drag. Although expressing the concept through a variety of different stories and examples, monotonous redundancy quickly set in.<br />Secondly, Csikszen doesn't seem to achieve exellence in any department. This is neither a good self-help book nor a ground-breaking piece of science. And for all the psychology I have read, I would be hardpressed to label this psychology either. In any event, it is certainly not good psychology. It is just one overly simple view of what happiness is, expressed over and over again as Csikszen recounts the experiences of different sujects \\"flowing\\".<br />Finally, the book completely side-steps a real treatment of psychological neuroses. If you are unhappy because you suffer from serious issues that must be understood, contextualized and overcome, this is not the book for you. This book naively assumes that all problems vanish or are forgotten forever by focusing on the moment - and as far as the author is concerned, it doesn't matter what one focuses on. I picture a manic-depressive \\"flowing\\" on legos all day (my favorite form of flow).  The Kids in the Hall film, \\"Brain Candy,\\" quickly comes to mind.<br />This is a trifling book that is not worth your time. If you are interested in \\"flowing\\" in the first place, you need not read the book, because it will get you no closer to the immaculate \\"flow\\" experience. That said, if you are looking for ethically-charged, important, consequencial type of flow, seek out your local Buddhist organization.

Indeed, Philosopher's like finding fault with things, especially Deconstructionist Philosophers like Derrida - who complicate everything.<br />Some critics have said that this book fails as a novel but succeeds as an introduction to Philosophy.  Another critic has said that, &quot;In fact the book is not an introduction to philosophy at all but an introduction to the author's take on various philosophers, which is a very different thing.&quot;  I'm simply going to say that this book was a fun exploration of Philosophy, and the fact that Gardener's view permeate the text made it that much more enjoyable.<br />The book is not a complete history of philosophy, because many important thinkers and genres were left out.  Nor is the book a &quot;true&quot; history of Philosophy, because such a history does not exist.  As we all know, there are a variety of historical perspectives, and we see these from Copleston to Russell.  All histories of Philosophy are injected with bias, opinions, and emphases characteristic of the author's personality and area of interest.  In fact, that is what makes many of those works interesting in their own right.<br />Take Hegel's Philosophy of History, for example.  Objectively speaking, it is perhaps the worst History of Philosophy every written, and yet his vision of an organic philosophical spirit moving through history is breath-taking.  Or take a Marxian history of Philosophy.  Almost all Marx-inspired histories focus on class at the expense of everything else, from ideas to race.  And yet for the Marxist, such histories are deemed important and true in the final sense of the word.<br />Therefore, I must assess Gardner in her own right.  For what she set out to accomplish and inspire, this book was a complete success.  Namely, if you are new to philosophy, this book will do exactly what any good philosophical primer should do:  It will pique your sense of wonder, while at the same time providing you with a fairly good introduction to Philosophy's most prominent thinkers.  If you happen to enjoy the teenage plot and its strange conclusion, so much the better.<br />Both Plato and Aristotle agreed that the origin of all Philosophy lies in wonder, and this book will provide the reader with a sense of philosophical wonder.

A couple of them openly confessed to having given up part-way through.  My question:  Why are you reviewing the book you haven't even read?  Granted, it's not a Hollywood film, but it is perhaps one of the greatest works of the 20th century, written by an author who stands on par with Gandhi or Mother Teresa in her committment to social justice.  Think about it this way:  Addams' settlement house (or Hull House, as it was called) was like an ashram built in the middle of Chicago's dirtiest late 19th century slum.  She was doing social work of a kind that had never been done before - working with immigrants, single mothers, orphins, troubled youth and the unemployed.  The scope of her sociological experience has never been matched.  Politically, Addams was an advocate for the abolition of war, and these views not only secured her the Nobel Prize, but also a black-listing with the House of Un-American Activities.  I don't see what is not to like about this book.  It is autobiographical in the strict sense of the term, but Addams was larger than life.  If you are even vaguely interested in ethics, social work, sociology, social justice, or democracy, Addams' story will inspire and amaze you.  Her life was a paradigmn of exellence.  It was a life that will inspire you to achieve greatness yourself.  I cannot over-recommend familiarizing yourself with this figure, and 20 Years at Hull House is the best place to start.	2002-05-08

Furthermore, Weber Linn was an English scholar, so his writing style is very refined and easy to read. Despite its complete lack of citations, the author is very objective to the subject at hand. The end result is a very intimate portrait of one (if not the) most amazing woman in American History. Some of the larger aspects of her life included: forming the Women's League for Peace in WWI, winning the Nobel Peace Prize, setting off the Settlement house movement in United States, and being blacklisted by the House for Un-American Activities (yes, she was that cool!). The greatness of Jane Addams is to be found in the details, however, and this book provides the reader with just that.  An amazing life, well told.	2002-05-08

He wanted to see if complete self-reliance was possible, and perhaps get a little closer to Mother Nature. As an experiment in pure solitary living, unaided by the trapping and encumberances of society, Thoreau failed miserably. But as a book of profound insight and beauty, Waldon ranks supreme in the history of American literature, and the bulk of his insights and observations stand even today. I say failed, because Thoreau often spent evenings at the town pub, drinking and talking until late at night, wherefrom he would stumble home drunk without the aid of lamp light. Moreover, aside from a doting mother who would often bring him homemade victuals as a break from mountain berries and unlevened homemade bread, he often stayed over with the Emersons when the pangs of loneliness were particularly biting. Not of word of this will you find mentioned in Waldon, though, for it would go against what Thoreau has to say about charity: namely, that no deserves it. So clearly Thoreau was never as detached from society as he would have us believe, and yet that is neither here nor there. An amazing writer, an observant naturalist, a brilliant social critic, and perhaps the most singular individual America has ever known - Thoreau cannot be beat. And this edition of Waldon is particularly good, in that Hardin has done exactly what all editors should do: In keeping with the Thoreauvian motto, he has made the text \\"simple, simple, simple\\" and accessable, clarifying points when necessary with annotated footnotes. After reading Waldon, you might also want to check Harding's biography of Thoreau, which I highly recommend. Among other things, you will learn about his trouble with women.

Even for scholars of epistemology, this book can be rather frustrating. Originally written for his grad students at Harvard, the book lacks much in the way of context, and it is completely theoretical. Furthermore, it is filled with many untranslated passages, from German to Latin. I gave the book four stars because it could use some editing. This is the modern era: Latin is dead - even for the most serious philosopher - and German is no longer the language of Philosophy. The passages should be translated, and some of the more abstract essays should come with introductions.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good read. I had no idea that factory workers made 419 times less than the average American CEO (some newer publications say 475 times less), and Hobsbawm's analysis of the \\"global gap\\" is penetrating. Wealth is polarizing not only within but also between nation states. As he says, we now live in a world \\"where people can live on cake rather than bread,\\" a world where one-sixth of the world population is hungry or food insecure. Perhaps Hobsbawwm is at his best in this book when he analyses the insular nature of contemporary life in wealty Western states, like American:<br />\\"...to live in the the favored regions is to be virtually cut off from the experiecnce, let alone the reactions, of people outside those regions. It takes an enormous effort of the imagination, as well as a great deal knowledge, to break out of our comfortable, protected, and self-absorded enclaves and enter an uncomfortable and unprotectd larger world inhabited by the majority of the species. We are cut off from this world even if the sum total of amassed information is everywhere accessible at the click of a mouse, if images of the remotest parts of the globe reach us at all times of day and night, if more of us travel between civilaztions than ever before. This is the paradox of a globalized twenty-first century.\\"<br />In this book, Hobsbawm does a pretty good job of fleshing out general trends (like the decline of the nation-state, the rise of private rogue armies, the burgeoning service economy) and placing these within his now standard historical framework; but the book is lacking in many respects. Most notably, the he completely downplays or ignores the current eco-crisis. He never mentions how one in four Americans will now get cancer; how DDT and PCBs and other unhealthy toxic chemicals continue to pollute our soil, water and bodies; or how genetically-modified foods and organisms (GMO), bovine growth hormones (rBGH), and a wide variety of hormone disrupters are being surrepticiously placed into American food and household products, thereby making all Americans de facto guneia pigs. Furthermore, he doesn't even mention the intellectual property rights issue, which is perhaps the most important issue of our time!  See Vanda Shiva's \\"Stolen Harvest\\" for a quick primer.<br />Nor does this book make any solid attempt to link the colonial and imperialistic history of the Third World with the contemporary situation, although obviously Hobsbawm has a firm understanding of the historical processes of Imperialism and Colonialism (see his three-part history serious). Today, although colonialism and Empire have officially ended, Third World markets remain subjugated to their former colonial and imperial overlords. The masters of old continue to rob these regions of primary resources to be used in Northern industries, and they continue to imports large-scale cash crops from these regions at the expense of local, traditional crops, biodiversity and food security. This has huge effects on the local food and job market. The results are often broad-based poverty and hunger, as can been seen in Brazil and Bangladesh -- two big food exporters.<br />The economic North has also increasingly set out to export menial labor to Third World these days, which has an equally devistating effects on local life, albeit it in different and multifarious ways. The exportation of labor also hollows out production and jobs in the home economy as well, leading to what has now been called the \\"Third-Worldization\\" of the North. Hobsbawm gives some analysis of multinational corporations and their effects on global labor and environmental issues, but it seems very topographical, like the rest of the book. After finishing, I felt let down. A lot more could have been accomplished with this subject in my opinion.with this subject in my opinion.	2002-04-28

For so many Americans, life in this country is a nightmare.  This book is a real eye-opener. Well-written, well-researched, and timely. Read it and discover for yourself the extent to which basic human rights have been abused and ignored.  Moreover, discover how you can join in the effort to realize the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both at home and abroad.<br />SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL FIND IN THE BOOK:<br />1) Detailed descriptions of labor camp life in the agricultural South:  in particular, rounding up streets addicts or homeless youth to work as near slaves in the fields.  Aka, debt peonage.  I was absolutely shocked that some 130 after the Civil War, America is still enslaving the unfortunate and desperate so that we consumers can wear cotton shirts and eat fresh vegetables.  If this not an example of human rights abuses, I don't know what is.<br />2) The Ghettofication of many inner-cities in America:  in particular, the \\"decentralization of employment\\" phemenon, where jobs move from metropolitan areas to the suburbs.  This often creates pockets of (usually Black and Latino) poverty in dense, inner-city areas, which are then often industrialized, or used as waste-disposal areas:  medical equipment incineration, garbabe dumps, etc.  Some authors have described this process as a new form of racism - environmental racism - in that disadvantaged minority groups are usually left to live in highly polluted areas, where asthma and cancer rates soar.  (See FACES OF EMVIRONMENTAL RACISM, edit. Laura Westra and Bill Lawson for details on this issue.)<br />3) \\"Average unemployment rates have been rising for the last quarter century in virtually all Western Industrialized nations.\\"  People end up being \\"caught between declining income and rising costs.\\"  \\"Through most of the 60s and 70s, the income earned by a person working full time at a minimum wage job was sufficient to keep a family of three out of offical poverty.  By 1994, a minimum wage job, forty hours a week, 52 weeks a year would not even keep a household of two above the poverty threshold...the minimum wage does not even pay enough to keep a single individual above the poverty line.\\"  But then, who didn't know that intuitively?<br />4) There is a \\"spiritual crisis facing America:  that those who have more than they need rest comfortably, while those who lack basics struggle and suffer.  If we pay attention only to the corporate media, we might believe in the sparkling, computer-driven, global marketplace, a new economy where everyone is better off.  As we now know, the reality is otherwise for millions of Americans.  We call for a national debate that addresses the root causes of the crisis that we face, and places them in the context of basic human rights for all.\\"<br />5) \\"Since 1989 the poorest fifth of families have lost %587 each and the richest five percent have gained $29,533 each.  We have five times more billionaires, but four million more poor children.\\"<br />By no means exaustive or representative, I recommend reading the whole thing.  This book is literally a cornucopia of essays from a variety of scholars, as well as some first-person accounts from peonage laborers.  The book is broken up into Five sections: The New American Crisis, Root Causes, What's Wrong With Welfare, Human Rights for America, and the epilogue:  Building the Movement for Human Rights in America.  It would be impossible for me cover all the terraine this book encompases.  A must read for anyone concerned with justice, human rights or the future of America.as sufficient to keep a family of three out of offical poverty.

US	38685946	R1R1CQ2ZEKWJPY	0679752552	916213869	Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prison	Books	5	258	277	N	N	We Are All Inside the Panopticon Now	This book has been described as Foucault's masterpiece, and for good reason.  Through this \\"genealogy\\" of history, Foucault shows us how modern society has become penal and coercive in nature; and perhaps more importantly, that all us now live in the midst of an abstract, authoritative public \\"gaze.\\"<br />Although the book traverses a lot of historical ground, Foucault's discussion culminates in an analysis of Jeremy Bentham's prison concept.  Bentham, the founder of Utilitarianism philosophy, believed that individual rights are subordinate to the state.  In fact, he went so far as to call them \\"nonsense on stilts.\\" As long as the government protected its people and treated them decently, he did not believe that the polity could be accused of oppressing its citizen - be they convicts or otherwise.  Thus, Bentham was the first philosopher to give the modern penal system its rational underpinnings.  Today, we take it as a matter of course that those who do not conform to laws are trucked off to prison.  But with this book, Foucault attempts to completely undermine our intuitive sense of what is right, what is coercive, what is rational, and ultimately what is true.  Perhaps better than any other author out there, Foucault shows us the subtle madness of Western institutional logic.<br />Foucault focused on Bentham's prison model, or the Penopticon as Bentham called it - which literally means, that which sees all.  The Penopticon prison, which was popular in the early nineteenth century, was designed to allow guards to see their prisons, but not allow prisoners to see guards.  The building was circular, with prisoner's cells lining the outer diameter, and in the center of the circle was a large, central observational tower.  At any given time, guards could be looking down into each prisoner's cells - and thereby monitor potentially unmoral behavior - but carefully-placed blinds prevented prisoners from seeing the guards, thereby leaving them to wonder if they were being monitored at any given moment.  It was Bentham's belief that the \\"gaze\\" of the Panopticon would force prisoners to behave morally.  Like the all-seeing eye of God, they would feel shame at their wicked ways.  In effect, the coercive nature of the Panopticon was built into its very structure.<br />Discipline and Punish is still relevant for today, even though the Panopticon has vanished.  For starters, the United States government now possesses the technology to view see and hear anybody on the face of the planet.  In fact, just recently the FBI announced that they have the right (invested in them by the state) to monitor any phone conversations they deem a threat to national security.  Furthermore, for the same reason, the CIA or the DIA may use high-tech satellite technology to monitor actions anywhere on the face of the planet.  Currently, these satellites have the ability to spot and read the date off a dime in the street.  These new technological developments have completely altered the meaning \\"gaze\\" in the modern context.  In a very real way, we are all living in the Panopticon now.<br />Moreover, Foucault would have never guessed the future of American prison systems.  Today, Americans put more people behind bars than in any other country in the world, while public education, job training, and other resources that might potentially help people stay off drugs or out of crime in the first place are under funded.  Furthermore, the vast majority of convicts who are released - many having been brutalized in prison - often end up behind bars again in no time, usually for small offenses involving drugs or petty larceny (that is, non-violent crimes involving property).  Thirty years ago, when Foucault died, prisons were still run by the state.  However, today prisons are increasingly being privatized and run as businesses, with the further benefit of huge government subsidies.  The United States now prioritizes prison funding over education and rehabilitation - spending roughly 40 billion a year on operation and construction of new prisons.  The prison industry is booming.<br />Anyway, this book is a must-read classic.  It will abhor you, enthrall you, and provide immeasurable food for thought.  It drove me to ask questions about the nature of knowledge, history, and the evolution of a persecuting society. Controversial to the teeth, this work will definately activate all your higher faculties and blast you off on all sort of theoretical tangents. Once I started I couldn't put it down.  As Foucault said himself, he writes \\"experience book,\\" and I couldn't agree more.  I highly recommend having this experience, if only for the sake of where it will land you.<br />A final note for those who are interested... Oddly enough, Jeremy Bentham was not buried or incinerated like most people after he died.  He willed his body to be preserved and displayed. It was dissected in a medical amphitheater at the Web Street School of anatomy in London, three days after his death.  (By the way, this was illegal at the time.  Only executed murderers could be dissected according to the law).  His organs were then removed, and the original head replaced with a wax one.  After being stolen by students as a joke, the real head is now kept in a safe in the College.  The body, dressed in Bentham's own clothes, remains stuffed with hay, straw, wool, cotton and lavender to keep moths away.  Since he was a founder of University College, Bentham is ensconced inside a glass fronted mahogany case (on casters), set unceremoniously in a busy hallway.  He is regularly visited by scholars from all over the world, once went to a beer festival in Germany, and is brought to the table once a year for the annual Bentham Dinner.  Amazingly, he was also trundled to the annual Board of Directors meeting for years, who still leave his old chair empty out of respect.tation - spending roughly 40 billion a year on operation and construction of new prisons.

When it came out some 100 years ago, The Principles was criticized as \\"un-systematic.\\" James would have taken this as a compliment.  It is exactly because this book is not an elaborately contrived system that it remains fresh as a morning flower. Full of details and insight, it is perhaps the most epic and insightful psychological work every produced.  That said, The Principles doesn't quite stay within the bounds of psychology. As you will see from the citations (which are voluminous), James was also well read in the humanities, from abstruse philosophy to literary fiction. But then, James was living in a time when Philosophy and Psychology were not distinct disciplines.  Not a problem if you enjoy philosophizing.  For its breadth, scope and penetrating insights, this book might never grow stale.	2002-04-26

Whatever you believe, there is much to be had in the Varieties. James weaves through the experiences of many different individuals, clarifying and illuminating both their inner and practical meaning. Decidedly, the book focuses on mystics, gnostics, the extremely devout and the chronically depressed at the exclusion of more mundane religious experiences. A very interesting bunch. Perhaps the most fascinating thing about the book:  One of the depressed characters James mentions is none other than James himself! Similar to his father, Henry Sr., William had a psychological breakdown at about the age of thirty. As James describes it in his memoirs and letters, the nature of the breakdown was such that he had lost faith in free-will. As he asks in his psychology, are we merely automaton slaves to our underlying biology, or do we have the ability to act independently and free? A quagmire any relentless self-examining philosopher could get hung up on. And James was just that - relentless in self-examination. Indeed, his quest for the truth was epic. You can never go wrong reading anything he wrote. Always well-thought-out, clear and penetrating. This man illuminates everything he touches.	2002-04-26

Learn how our system creates pockets of poverty amid bubbles of wealth.  Kozol breaks it down for the reader in black and white:  It's a matter of funding.  Why do some schools have 10 times the bugget of others?  Why do some school lack the funds to buy adequate textbooks or draw good teachers?  The facts will shock you.  Without equal federal funding, the school system is terribly unequal, and the product of this inquality is illiteracy, high drop-out rates, and a host of other problems.  As Kozol shows us in his book, bad genes are not the issue.  This is not a case of inherited IQ or laziness.  The problem is our social system:  a system where some children are given glorious opportunities, while others are left in the dust.  To quote Thoreau, \\"For every ten people hacking away at the Tree of Evil, only one is hacking at the roots.\\"  Make no mistake, Kozol is among that ten percent.  His axe is sharp, and he has taken direct aim at the problem.  A must read for anyone vaguely concerned with inequality, democracy, or social justice.	2002-04-26

Saddam Hussein is a bad man, granted, but most Americans are completely unaware that the US armed him in the 1980s, thereby giving him the firepower he needed to massacre tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds. Moreover, not too many Americans know that the US and the UK are now engaged in deadly biological warfare in Iraq: \\"The destruction of infrastructure and banning of imports to repair it has cased disease, malnutrition, and early deaeth on a huge scale, including more than 500,000 children, according to UNICEF investigators - an average of 5,000 children dying each moth.... The US and Britain have taken the lead in blocking aid programs - for example, delaying approval for ambulances on the grounds that they could be used to transport troops, and barring insecticides for preventing the spread of disease and spare parts for sanitation systems.\\" All the while, as innocent Iraqi people are dying and Saddam Hussein remains in pwer, the US continues to purchase Iraqi oil - only now its pennies on the dollar as dictated by the \\"Oil for Food\\" program. Of course, the story is much more detailed than this, and Chomsky's book helps flesh out some of these details that never seem to end up in mainstream media sources. But Chomsky doesn't just limit his analysis to Iraq. In this book, he provides a global survey of all the so-called Rogue States: The Balkans, East Timor, Colombia, Cuba and Latiin America in general. Chomsky also throws in commentary on European colonial history, imperialism, the rise corporate capitalism, and critiques the modern global economy. This is compact and potent Chomsky: a factual wrap sheet placed within the historical context of Empire and conquest. If you are looking for a quick intro to Chomsky's views, this is a good place to start. Perhaps Chomsky's most readable critique of the \\"Washington Concensus.\\" At times repetetive, but then Chomsky is getting old. A good read.	2002-04-25

David Barsamian is the cult superhero/guru of informative underground radio. He has also been doing cool interviews with prominant Leftist (read: critical) intellecutuals like Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn for a long time now. And thank god! Barsamian asks essential questions, and provides long-tenured intellectuals like Chomsky a venue for expressing their views in non-dissertation format. In other words, Barsamin gives us an accessible Chomsky, in plain, straight-forward, non-technical language. Who would have thought? If you are like me, and you always wanted to know what in the hell Chomsky is talking about (Try reading \\"The Culture of Terrorism\\"), this is your book. It even has a nice index with references, unlike some of his other books (\\"Profit Over People\\" has no footnotes for the first three chapters!!!). Lastly, this book also provides us with a sketch of Noam as human being. Apparently now that he is a grandfather, Chomsky has started spending time with young children and making appearances in public places, like baseball stadiums!!! Picture it: Chomsky consenting to sit for two hours without books, eat manufactured hotdogs and watch corporate-sponsered displays of wreckless, winner-take-all competition a la a Boston Red Sox game. A bit ironic, wouldn't you say? But as he says in the book, even hard-nosed intellectuals \\"need an annual breakout into the real world.\\" Anyway, the book was enjoyable and engrossing. Definately worthy of being added to the canon.<br />Issues it covers:  Activism and public outcry against the MIA, as well as a description of what the MIA means (note:  you can find a better description of the MIA and WTO challenge in David Suzuki's new book, \\"Good News\\"); history of America's involvement in East Timor; discussion of the land mines, agent organge, dioxin, and napalm (see Sandra Steingraber's \\"Living Downstream\\" for important scientific look at what dioxin actually does to the human body - rest assured it is not good); the privitization of the Internet; critique of modern economic theory; an analysis of international debt peonage; as usual, discussion of America's dirty roll in Guatamala and other Latin American coutries; analysis of intellecutual property/patenting rights (better discussed in \\"Against the Grain,\\" by Lappe); critique of the Health Care system; interesting biographical information (e.g., he taught Hebrew out of his house in the early days); penetrating discussion of Amartya Sen's book, \\"The Black Book of Communism\\" (if Communism is responsible for 100 million deaths, how many deaths has capitalism claim?? -- very original stuff here); interesting facts about Plan Colombia (slightly different version of what he says in \\"Rogue States\\"); critique of the UN and Nato; discussion of the Isreal/Palestine issue (his unstated speciality); a critique of media propaganda and Freedom of Information Act (What freedom?

A well-grounded and researched work of ecological imagination. Worth your time.	2002-04-25

Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II	Books	5	39	43	N	N	A Thorough Critique of American Policy for the Last 50 Years	This is an unbelievably-well-documented expose of American Foregin Policy over the last 50 years. Although his style leaves much to be wanting, Blum's book is filled to the brim with facts that are never discussed by traditional political analysts. Rarely does one catch a glimpse of the underbelly of America Foreign Policy, and that is exactly what Blum here provides. Some reviewers have said that he is a biased Leftist spouting agitprop, or that he is pushing an ideological agenda, but frankly I just didn't see this. If pedaling truth is an ideological activity, then I suppose they are right. The fact is, Blum is a master of weeding through and exposing the lies and propaganda of American policy makers. This is not \\"disinformation\\" (as one reviewer put it) but pure, documented facts -  and lots of them. Blum comes off as an author who has committed himself to finding and providing the public straight, unvarnished truth - a very difficult project when one considers the extent of government, military and media obfuscation. Although Blum's tone can be distainful and even downright angry at times, it is nonetheless justified. As you will see in the book, the United States government has done some terrible things - things that would drive any genuine patriot to righteous indignation. Blum's findings might be difficult for the average American to swallow, but then the truth is like that sometimes. Open your mouth and open your mind. This book is food for rational thought. A timely, much needed expose of an imperialist military that has completely slipped away from public control.	2002-04-24

I would go so far as to say that his understanding of humanity and its place in nature is perhaps unequaled among environmental philosophers today. Aside from working as a scientist, Suzuki also spent some 30-some years producing nature documentaries.  This gave him the opportunity travel the globe, visit many different cultures and geographic regions, from indigenous tribes to povrety-striken Third World nations.  It was through profound cultural education that Suzuki unlearned the mad science he studied as a youth and gained new understand about culture, economics and biodiversity.  Nowadays, Suzuki mainly spends his time writing books and articles.  He also runs an environmental organization in Canada, where he and his family live, called the David Suzuki Foundation.  The website address is: [...]<br />DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK:<br />In this book Suzuki teams up with writer and researcher Holly Dressel to produce a sort of global guide to the biosphere-a work of scope and detail that will amaze you.  They will walk you through ancient arboreal forests and the global economy with the ease of an experienced mountain tracker.  They will be introduced you to people and movements that are sure to move.  And perhaps most importantly the book will provide you with an important ecological perspective.  Filled with stories, anecdotes, interesting facts, and tons of suggestions and references, from books to organizations - \\"From Naked Ape to Super-Species\\" is nothing less than a manual for humanity.  Simply put, this is one of the most important books I have read.<br />EXERPT:<br />\\"Time is the one ingredient that is absolutely for vital for nature.  It is the vast sweep of evolutionary time that has allowed life to flourish and huge changes to occur.  In the 4 billion years that life has existed, the sun has increased in intensity by 25 percent, magnetic poles have switched and reversed back, continents have smashed into each other and then pulled apart, ice ages and warm periods have come and gone, and the atmosphere has been transformed from a non-oxygen to a oxygen-rich one.  Yet life has persisted, simply because of the immense periods of time it has to make adjustments.<br />Today, the rate at which we are extracting trees, fish, topsoil and clean water, as well as creating pollutants and greenhouse gases, may match the speed of information technology and the economy, but it is not in synch with the reproductive rates of natural systems.  More and more, our sources of information are no longer connected to the natural world and its limits.  Politics, civic action and participatory democracy need time too.  Democratic groups like PTAs and other voluntary human institutions take time to do their work.<br />Until we slow down the rate of growth in information and technology and learn to pay attention to the true pace of the non-technological planet, we'll keep making unrealistic demands that can't be fulfilled.  At the very least, we need to understand that our accelerated rates of production and use of human-made technical information function at a completely different pace from that of the natural rates of information exchange, like those I experienced in the Brazilian rain forest.\\"<br />MAIN ISSUES:<br />General Environment Issuses:  from the toxification of our environment to Environmental Justice.<br />Consumer Issues:  How do our shopping habits effect the world aroud us?<br />The Question of Progress:  What does it mean?<br />Food Issues and Biotechnology:  In Canada, America, the world abroad.<br />Globalization Issues:  Impacts at home and abroad<br />Global Warming and Forest Issues<br />Non-Violent Direct Actions:  some groups and individuals fighting against large international corporations for local sovereignty<br />Human Rights, Environmental Rightse sun has increased in intensity by 25 percent, magnetic poles have switched and reversed back, continents have smashed into each other and then pulled apart, ice ages and warm periods have come and gone, and the atmosphere has been transformed from a non-oxygen to a oxygen-rich one.
