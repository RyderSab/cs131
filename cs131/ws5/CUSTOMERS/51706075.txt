In an excerpt from this book posted on amazon, the statement is made that one Arturo Toscanini set the record industry back, in the 1920s, by refusing to allow his voice to be recorded.  The Arturo Toscanini that most music lovers remember was conducting La Scala and the New York Philharmonic around that time. We don't think he was singing. Can the author address this? Perhaps I read the excerpt wrong. In this case, we're not talking about an obscure historical figure.	2004-01-31

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ron Bitto has been chronicling the ups and downs of the  oil patch, jetting all over the planet, wherever business calls. In Blind  Sidetrack, he puts a face on one corporation, the fictional American  Sidetrack, as it attempts to get its share of oil wealth using dubious  means.<br />Bitto's compelling and irresistible tale takes the reader all over  the world, following his main character, John Biondi, who works for the  company president. The president is everyone's nightmare of a  preposterously unfair, dishonest, greedy and abusive boss, facing the  crisis of his career. Unwittingly, Biondi intensifies the crisis as he is  seduced into the heat of it. With terror, corruption and avarice all  around, he and his cohorts barely escape with their lives. The reader is  inescapably drawn into the maelstrom of kidnappings and killings. And, in  every godforsaken location, there's always booze and broads for diversion.<br />Back home in Houston, there are wives and children who experience their  own stress at their husbands' long absences, filling their lives with  shopping, raising kids, and agonizing over their own temptations.<br />Bitto's  keen eye and ear for such happenings come mainly from firsthand  observation. Clearly, though, his is more than a journalist's mission. He  has a carefully modulated sense of adventure and tragedy, values and  visions, fate and opportunity. His novelist's orientation includes a strong  moral compass and an uncanny instinct for consequences.<br />Readers will  particularly feel drawn to some of the characters who seem to populate  every workplace: the aforementioned greedy and power-hungry CEO, the loyal  and expedient functionary, the hot-shot who always finds the spotlight, and  the facilitators who always seem to be playing both sides to their  advantage.<br />It's a crazy world that Bitto fashions, full of love,  friendship and affection as it is with backstabbing and turncoating. Not  only does he paint a realistic picture from first-hand experience, Bitto  has an exquisite sense of the surreal and absurd.a crazy world that Bitto fashions, full of love,  friendship and affection as it is with backstabbing and turncoating.

Seventeen computer whiz kids have  intercepted a secret nuclear destruction scenario formulated years ago by  the world's superpowers. The protagonist Crunch (author Townsend's persona)  agrees to help save the world.<br />Crunch opens a storefront in San Pedro,  California, and advertises for teenagers to help &quot;test pilot&quot; new  virtual reality games provided by game manufacturers. Woven in with this  plot is Crunch's theory about energy and how it is allocated to tasks. A  computer program called QuoVadoTron, which made him and his young whiz kid  associate Dooley Stepnowski rich, measures a company's energy level on a  daily or weekly basis, over twenty degrees of energy from &quot;Fetchwork  0&quot; to &quot;Stretchwork 10.&quot; The fictional software can project  how management decisions will affect employees' level of commitment and  thus, what level of energy they will devote to meeting goals and  objectives. If you get the feeling this book is hard to describe, you're  right. But I know of at least one CEO who might get it in a flash: T.J.  Rodgers of Silicon Valley's Cypress Semiconductor.<br />From QuoVadoTron, the  story wanders to other games invented by young Dooley. Each game requires  an assistant, and each assistant is obtained by having a contest and hiring  the winner. Everything is a game, every action and decision is a  spreadsheet entry that has potential consequences for the future. At the  end of a successful game, all hands celebrate.<br />Ther'e a fish story, some  health food advice, an emphasis on play, enjoyment of literature and music,  and some light moralizing, all delivered in Townsend's Brautiganesque plain  style.<br />The common thread is that work ought to generate high energy  levels. If it doesn't something can be done about it. Namely, hire younger  people whose energy isn't spent, assuming that smart kids of today will  have a reason to work tomorrow.<br />Some ideas which come out in this crazy  quilt of song lyrics, stories and management theory:<br />-Universal  downsizing-- no organization or institution should have more than 250  members;<br />-Bureaucrats have their function-- everyone should learn to tap  into government and get money out for their favorite causes;<br />-For  disadvantaged youth, it's hard to top the education and early retirement  benefits of a military career;<br />-Good grades in school and having fun are  not mutually exclusive;<br />-There's a strong connection between education  level and living well, assuming your past life has earned you a rich  present one.<br />Is it too much to expect a generation weaned on Beavis and  Butthead to read this book? Maybe. But Robert Townsend's head and heart are  both in the right place. Most of what's worthwhile tomorrow will be  accomplished by people born after 1970.

He's perhaps the most successful self-published author in the world. His books cost several thousand dollars and up. He's the world's most successful work-at-homer (he started out in a home office in the 1950s, way before it was cool). That he has entrepreneurial instincts there can be no doubt. We're talking about publishing wunderkind, Warren Buffett. Is it no coincidence that this formerly low-profile investor from Omaha, Nebraska has achieved pop icon status around the same time that working Americans are questioning and re-evaluating their own economic status and security in light of their career investments in time, money, and education? Roger Lowenstein is a Buffet biographer who was somewhat surprised when sales of his book passed the 100,000 mark. &quot;I guess I underestimated the number of people out there who want to get rich in the stock market,\\" he said. His paperback edition of Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, will hopefully begin to pay dividends for Doubleday's Main Street Books imprint this month. Warren Buffet is a well-known author to stockholders in his Berkshire Hathaway investment vehicle. He writes lengthy, folksy, and astutely analytical annual reports that stand in marked contrast to the PR-speak of most such documents. Some pay thousands of dollars for one share of Berkshire so they can read his annual missives. Lowenstein, a Wall Street Journal columnist, was a longtime reader who yearned to write about Buffet at length. Buffett did not share Lowenstein's enthusiasm so did not cooperate with the book. But he didn't try to interfere, either, according to the author. &quot;He was inadvertantly an entrepreneur, \\"said Lowenstein. \\"He started out as a guy in Omaha going around trying to raise money from people who were impressed with his self-confidence and brightness, and he worked out of his study. He had a neightbor named Don Keough, who later became president of the Coca-Cola Company. Buffett told him, `have you ever thought about these great kids you have, w! ho's gonna provide for `em? Maybe you oughta give me some of your money and let me invest it.' Keough thought about it and talked with his wife about it, and he knew that Buffett was right, but he told me he just couldn't get over the hump of giving money to somebody who sat around all day in a t-shirt. &quot;Buffett spent the day in his study when the respectable folk wore a coat and tie to the office. So Keogh didn't invest...After about 5 or 6 years Buffet got an office and he's in the same office his whole career. It's two miles from his house, so it's almost as if he just lengthened the corridor.

This edition has been updated and expanded to include more description of insurance, mutual funds, investment strategies, and retirement and estate issues. The authors' main bias is in favor of the planning process per se, not any one particular approach.	1998-05-19

First, 29 percent of households with income over $100,000 use the Internet. Second, only 35 percent of American families have personal computers. The growth possibilities simply demand that even non-computer-savvy businesses take a look at what \\"cyberpower\\" could do for them. Here are the six online business models as described by the authors: 1) Direct sales, where companies actually sell on the web, using online fulfillment, security, and ordering systems. 2) Subscriptions, where fees are charged for access to information. Fees can be quite low and still be profitable due to the minimal production costs of a product such as a newsletter, for example. 3) Advertising, where ads are placed on websites, such as the ads on the Yahoo search engine. Any site that draws people for one reason may be an advertising opportunity for marketers who want to make customers out of people drawn to the site. 4) Web Services, the moniker for all the occupations of consultant, designers, transaction processing, and other services unique to the World Wide Web. 5) Cost-savings in competition with traditional means of distribution such as snail mail. Federal Express and United Parcel Service use web sites to help customers track packages faster than they would through an 800 phone number. 6) Operation enhancement, through \\"infomercial\\" and other types of information provided to customers to enhance their experience with a company. This book is a helpful survey of the tools, models and strategies for Internet business, directed specifically to those with not enough time and prior knowledge to engage in a full-out investigation.

Bogle founded the $100 billion Vanguard Group, Inc. in 1974 and continues as chairman and CEO of each of its mutual funds. He writes that what you should be reading is mutual fund prospectuses-- about 20 of your own choosing, mostly stock funds but some bond and money market funds-- to gauge their objectives, investment policies, returns, risks and total costs over the long-term. If you're investing for the short-term, the prospectuses will outline key transaction policies on share redemption, exchanges, fees or limits on the frequency of exchanges.  Bogle on Mutual Funds is an instant classic for its lucidity in showing how to balance the risks of common stocks, bonds and money market reserves during different stages of a lifetime investment strategy.  A big difference is whether you compound the income portion of your investment return or spend it. In the long run, he writes, &quot;compound interest may indeed be the greatest mathematical discovery of all time for the investor seeking maximum reward.&quot; It helps fight price inflation and makes time into a fast friend. A long time horizon minimizes risk like nothing else, Mr. Bogle writes.  And of course he discusses asset allocation, offers his own model portfolios, and trumpets diversification, professional management, liquidity and convenience through mutual funds.  This is a book every investor should absorb, especially those who believe that wealth can be accumulated through the wise deployment of stocks' underlying values.<br /> Michael Pellecchia	1997-11-30

A friend was telling me what happened after his promotion to senior vice president was announced in the newspaper. Dozens of free offers began to come in the mail, such as coupons to use in exclusive clothing stores and free lunches for two at expense-account restaurants. One of the latter was for a restaurant he'd always wanted to visit. So he took the offer and was immediately surprised at how gracious the service was. He and his friend weren't that hungry, so they turned down an appetizer and a cocktail. After they had ordered a meal and told the waiter they would not have room for dessert, the waiter leaned in conspiratorially and whispered, \\"have some, for goodness sakes. It's all free!\\" My friend's unwillingness to capitalize on the restaurant's hospitality reminds me of the way some high net worth individuals look at taxes. They figure they owe it to someone to take some of the government's free offers, but not all of them. By \\"government free offers\\" I mean the ability of the system to give as well as take away. It doesn't necessarily give tax advantages out of social generosity (although it may seem that way politically sometimes). We simply have a system that can't know what you're doing all the time, and it doesn't want to know, either. Terry Coxon plumbs the principles and pragmatics behind the limits of the system. Planning to avoid taxes depends on knowing the world according to the IRS and the world as it really is, with all the gaps so implied. You should understand baically where tax rules come from and how they are enforced and changed. Investing is another activity where you can get easily sidetracked. You may think that the identity of a particular investment or strategy is of paramount importance. In reality, the only think important in your portfolio is results. Successful investors act on this instinctually. Others tend to get caught up in minutiae. Coxon also emphasizes protecting yourself against lawsuits, where anything you own could be used against you to satisfy a judgment or just scare you into submission. Litigation is not a gentlemen's game, as many losers of lawsuits find out the hard way. To maintain your financial privacy, don't use credit cards and checks routinely. Keep your checking account in another county, and change banks every few years. He also advises the use of a money market fund for checking, \\"so that no one can dig through your records without digging through the fund's records.\\" The author also advocates tax deferral through the use of mutual funds, deferred annuities, and even types of life insurance. This is where he loses me. Knowing a little about such things seems more dangerous than knowing nothing at all, and the chapters on these subjects are brief. Other tax deferral vehicles are outlined here: deferred-payment sales help you defer capital gains or interest income. A number of acceptable strategies exist to drag your feet abou recognizing gains which can be taxed. Coxon's attitude about recognizing losses is something I hadn't heard before, but it's consistent with the rest of his book: \\"A loss is an insult to the investor's pride, and no mere tax savings will make it tolerable. Selling is too much like putting on a dunce cap. \\"This attitude is difficult to escape. I can only point out that, if your investment is worth less than you paid for it, the loss has already occurred. So you should feel bad even if you don't sell. Selling is simply a way of getting the tax collector to share your grief.\\" This kind of advice is refreshing and will hit different people different ways.
