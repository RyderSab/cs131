And I live in Arkansas, so if -I- can get it, you can too. <br />Rankin writes with the same punny, off-the-wall humor as Douglas Adams or Gaiman and Pratchett in Good Omens. I could give examples, and started to, of the quirky sort of humor involved, but I decided that would give away some of the joy in reading. So let's just say it's as hilarious as-and leave it at that.	2004-05-14
US	50963139	R76OCWU9WK91U	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Lives up to the hype	I was really afraid to read this book after sifting through all the hype surrounding it and reading a few of the reviews on Amazon. I didn't want to waste my time reading a maudlin, sentimental \\"beach read.\\"<br />But I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. *The Lovely Bones* is not a highly complex, multifaceted novel, and the prose occasionally borders on purple--that's true. But the narration and characterization are straight-forward (as befits a 14-year-old's perspective, in my opinion) and there's something so fresh and original about the whole novel that I was immediately captivated. <br />Sebold has crafted a work that plumbs the depths of need, longing, and maturing on both sides of the thin veil that separates the living from the dead. It's not another talk-show-pick-of-the-month book, delving again and again into all the horrible things that can happen to women, children, and the people that love them; it's broader and yet narrower in scope, tracing the ties between the victim and her family and friends over a series of years, limning the way those ties tighten and fade and eventually heal.<br />Sebold has created a truly original heroine in Susie Salmon, one entirely believable and real, yet the other characters manage to live just as fully in the reader's imagination as she does, from her parents to her sister's boyfriend. The settings (mainly suburban Pennsylvania and Susie's heaven) are well-drawn as well, although I admit I'd have liked a few more details about heaven. Who wouldn't? <br />All in all, I highly recommend this book.	2002-08-03
US	50963139	R2SDQ48AYRID67	1573227889	440138927	Tipping the Velvet: A Novel	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Tipping the Velvet	Out of Sarah Waters's three novels (Tipping the Velvet, Affinity, and Fingersmith), Tipping the Velvet is to me the least accomplished and compelling. I've been a great fan of Waters since reading Affinity, a darkly moving and disturbing novel, and became an even greater one with Fingersmith, easily one of the best-written books of the last several years. But Tipping the Velvet seems to lack something of her later two efforts.<br />I grew rather tired of Nancy about halfway through the book. She just seems so adamantly miserable I wanted to shake her, and I couldn't help thinking Diana Lethaby, her mistress (in every sense of the word) for a thick portion of the novel, was little more than a caricature, for all her cruelty and in-your-face Sapphist traits.<br />The setting, too, I was disappointed in. I didn't have the same feeling of -being there- I got with Affinity and Fingersmith; Waters's portrayal of turn-of-the-century London is gorgeously written and as accurate as one could hope for in a novel, but it wasn't as real to me as Margaret's London or Sue and Maud's London. I found myself wishing more of the story were set in the music halls.<br />That being said, Tipping the Velvet is still an extraordinary novel. Waters writes with ease about her subject, as if she's known Nancy and the seediest parts of 19th century London all her life; and even the more graphic sex scenes come across as essential to the narrative. Her prose is beautiful and \\"writerly,\\" with very few flaws or off-putting quirks.<br />I recommend this book, although not as highly as Affinity or Fingersmith.	2002-07-09
US	50963139	R17XTOQS9AR2H6	0525946195	66868280	The Captain's Wife: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Entertaining	The Captain's Wife is a treat to read: it's fast-paced and authentic, with lots of adventure and drama. It's got strong characters, and Kelley is adept at describing life at sea--sometimes too adept, to tell the truth. I sometimes got lost in all the seafaring jargon, but never enough to miss out on what was going on. <br />Kelley also does a great job portraying Mary Patten and her role aboard ship. The Captain's Wife never becomes a &quot;girl power&quot; novel; by the same token, it's not a boring &quot;life at sea&quot; novel, either. It can easily appeal to males and females alike, unlike perhaps Ahab's Wife (another stellar novel, but one that seems to appeal more to women than men). The only thing I wondered about was Kelley's treatment of Mary's pregnancy. I'm pregnant myself, and I can't imagine, even in the midst of all the calamities going on at the time of the novel, being as unemotional toward the new baby as he portrays Mary. Perhaps unemotional is the wrong word; whenever the pregnancy is mentioned, it's mentioned as a joyful, wonderful thing--the problem is (for me, anyway) that it's hardly ever mentioned, like Mary forgets for whole weeks at a time she's even pregnant. Still, that's not enough to mar his characterization of her or the novel as a whole.<br />I was a little disappointed with the editing of the book--there were several typos and plain old mistakes, which I found disconcerting, but I know that sort of thing bothers me more than it does a lot of people. <br />Overall, I'd say this novel is well worth a read. It's inviting, engaging, and above all, entertaining.	2002-06-28
US	50963139	R1GHCP5JE5EBJI	1573222038	595147475	Fingersmith	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Excellent suspense	Sarah Waters's third offering, Fingersmith, is one of those books that manages to sustain its pacing and interest throughout, despite any number of Dickensian twists and turns in the truly byzantine plot. The tone is dark and melancholy (although lighter than Affinity's), but there's always a glimmer of hope to keep you reading. Waters's pacing, setting, and characterization are among the most remarkable I've encountered.<br />The one thing that bothers me most about Waters's books is the public's and critics' tendency to lump them in with \\"lesbian fiction.\\" What the heck is that? I'm not a lesbian, and I still find her books thoroughly engaging, interesting, riveting, and, frankly, fantastic. I'll read anything she writes, no matter what the sexuality of the characters....Highly recommended.	2002-04-18

While I don't feel the new novel measured up to the impossibly high standards the previous two set--and what novel could?--Lost is still well worth a read, especially as a first venture into Maguire's literary world.<br />I'll refrain from posting a summary of the plot (although I will warn potential readers: whoever wrote that Publisher's Weekly review above evidently did not read the novel very closely, so don't be expecting too much from it!), and simply say it took me quite a while to get into the book. I was about half way through before I felt things had really gotten started. I was also a little disappointed in the end--the third act, so to speak, seemed too short, to wrap up too quickly and neatly, without enough details to satisfy me.<br />Despite all those criticisms, Maguire is still a master of the form, touching on any number of relevant themes: the nature of love and motherhood, the supernatural, and what it means to be haunted.<br />Recommended.	2002-04-10

I had high hopes for Perfect Recall, but the new stories it contains did not meet my expectations. The minimalist, tight style I adore in The Burning House has given way to a rambling, lengthy style that often seems to detract as much as it adds, and I ended very few of the stories feeling that I had learned something, or even felt something, worthwhile--I felt like I hadn't read just a disappointing Beattie story, which is bad enough, but a disappointing short story. <br />There are a few stories worth reading, of course. The title story is Beattie at her best, and &quot;The Famous Poet, Amid Bougainvillea&quot; is a slow, melancholoy nocturne of a story that left me thinking &quot;THIS is what Beattie is all about.&quot; &quot;See the Pyramids&quot; and &quot;Mermaids&quot; have their moments, but I don't think either of them reaches the heights of some of Beattie's former stories.	2002-03-01

He was a child when the movie first came out, and the whole family--two adults and six kids--piled in the family station wagon and went to see it at the drive-in. When the Wicked Witch of the West put in her first appearance, she scared my father so badly he hid on the floorboards of the car and didn't watch the rest of the movie.<br />Why am I telling you all this? Because it's all about perception, different perspectives. To my dad--and to most people watching the movie or reading the original L. Frank Baum books--the Wicked Witch is just that: a one-dimensional incarnation of evil, cackling over poor innocent Dorothy and her little dog, too.<br />Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked, however, challenges our perception of not only the Witch, but of evil, theology, race, sex, friendship, love, forgiveness--the list goes on and on. Maguire's greatest achievement is presenting all those challenges in an entertaining, thought-provoking story that never sags or dwindles in energy.<br />Elphaba (the Witch) is a rounded, complex character. Like all humans, she is both good and evil to some extent, always carrying the capacity for either--or both. Maguire doesn't diminish Glinda's character, either. It would have been easy to make her a caricature (and she does at times border one), but Maguire imbues her with saving graces, hints of humanity that remind us of why she and Elphie are friends and why their paths diverge so wildly over the course of their lives.<br />The book's greatest flaw is it's ending. It feels a little hurried, although I do like the way Maguire rendered the famous parapet scene. I got the feeling, while reading, that Elphie was forgetting herself, that Maguire was feeling the pressure of the film version perhaps too much. Regardless of that criticism, the ending is not flawed enough to detract from the overall power of the novel; it does work within the confines of the story.<br/>Wicked is many things: an excursion into the nature of evil and forgiveness; a politically-minded cautionary tale; a revisionist history of a much-loved tale. And, remarkably, it succeeds. It succeeds in changing the reader's perceptions about the Wicked Witch of the West--and perhaps other issues as well.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-03-16

The familiar details of the Cinderella story are hidden--sometimes tucked away, barely recognizable, sometimes out in the open but in different dress--waiting for the reader to discover.<br />Like Wicked, his other novel, Maguire packs Confessions with layers of meaning. It's a discourse on the nature and value of beauty; the relationships between women and between women and men; the nature of a changeling; and what it means to &quot;jump,&quot; as Margarethe refers to self-preservation.<br />I also liked the way Clara was portrayed. In this version, she's not relegated to the status of servant by her tyrannical stepmother, she chooses it for herself--her own method of jumping. Additionally, while the relationships between the Fisher sisters and Clara are not always sisterly, they're dynamic relationships that reflect the caprices, virtues, and prejudices of real people, not the flat relationships portrayed in most versions of the Cinderella story. <br />My biggest complaint about the novel is a pretty minor one. I won't ruin the surprise, but I was disappointed in the way Maguire handled the Epilogue. It didn't seem to fit with the rest of the novel; it's as it he wrote it simply for the value of a &quot;twist.&quot;<br />Regardless, readers interested in retellings of popular fairy tales, Dutch culture and history, or simply literary fiction will like this novel. Recommended.	2001-03-16
US	50963139	RZQMU8EVCLBIP	0874835763	188791398	In Full Bloom	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An excellent idea!	What a great idea! In Full Bloom pairs folktales from all over the world with vignettes about real women--real, mature women. Each folktale/vignette exemplifies a certain trait or common experience of mature women, such as &quot;Protecting Our Daughters&quot; (Demeter and Persephone/Elizabeth Morgan) and &quot;Breaking Free of Convention&quot; (Lilith/Mae West).<br />Additionally, the book is broken up into two sections, Roses and Not Roses. The Roses are the traditional women, or women acting in traditional roles, while the Not Roses are untraditional women. Creeden doesn't denigrate or glorify either--she celebrates them equally and shows the reader the best sides of those roles.<br />Finally, Creeden includes a comprehensive collection of notes, which I particularly liked. I'm interested in folklore, so the notes gave me a good starting place for more research.<br />I have no problem recommending this book to everyone. Just because it's about mature women doesn't mean only they will appreciate it!	2001-02-08

I've read it over and over since then, though, and each time I pick out new clues, new hints, new allusions, new jokes . . . This is a textbook example of a LAYERED novel. <br />As many other reviewers have pointed out, understanding this book can hinge on a liberal arts education. I had one, I'm happy to say--we even operated on a trimester system, just like Blackstock, the college Janet attends in the novel (which is loosely based on Carleton College in Minnesota--after reading this book, I seriously considering transfering there).<br />Now. The ending IS a bit rushed. I tallied it up once: Janet's freshman year takes up very nearly one half of the book, while her other three years take up progressively fewer pages. The &quot;fairy tale&quot; ending gets a similarly rushed treatment, but I don't think that necessarily detracts from the story as a whole, especially if you're familiar with the Tam Lin ballad--which I wasn't when I first read it, and I still loved it.<br />If you can find it, buy it. This isn't a book to be borrowed from the library and read once--you'll never catch everything. Buy it, read it, read it again, and then read it once more. After a year or so, read it again.	2001-02-06

You won't like what I have to say next.<br />I thought this novel had lots of potential. Fitch creates a unique, genuine voice for Astrid, and her development as a character is well-plotted and well-drawn through the first third or so of the novel. Astrid's mother was also intriguing, and the main reason I picked this book up, despite it's being an Oprah pick. I was fascinated by the hard, brittle poet and her Viking heritage. <br />That said, after Astrid goes into foster care, the novel becomes less a novel than a series of undeveloped vignettes. Astrid rarely seems like the same character from home to home, and while that may be part of Fitch's point, she doesn't accomplish the transitions smoothly enough to keep me interested in Astrid's fate. Her character becomes less sympathetic as the &quot;novel&quot; wears on: I grew increasingly frustrated with her determination not to be happy, whatever the cost. By the time she goes to live with the Russian woman and her house of garbage, I was thoroughly bored and annoyed with Astrid, and it took a lot of effort to keep reading through the end.<br />I found this to be like most Oprah picks: a shallow, circumspect effort. Fitch has a lovely, poetic writing style that could have made this &quot;novel&quot; an important, riveting piece of fiction; at most, it's an easy beach read. If you want serious fiction, look elsewhere.	2000-10-26

Her prose sucks the reader into the story, into the hearts and lives of her characters, and doesn't spit one out again until long after the last page is turned. I finished the book more than a week ago, yet I still find myself mulling over episodes and wishing I was still in the thick of the story. My only complaint is that I guessed the &quot;twist&quot; too soon--and I'm a fanatic about not guessing the end; I never look for clues, prefering the story rather to unfold so that I can pick up on those clues at a later reading. In the Blind Assassin, clues are plentiful--even once the twist is guessed--and perhaps too much so. Regardless, this is a stunning piece of fiction and highly recommended.	2000-10-06

A coworker brought it to me, however, with lots of praise, and I wasn't disappointed. Huston's prose is easy and engaging, if unconventional. Her characters really lived for me, too, despite my distance from place (Paris), time (late 1950s-early 1960s), and situation (war, adultery). I wasn't satisfied with the end, however, which seemed too abrupt. There was little to no falling action after the unlooked-for climax, and I felt a little cheated by that. Over all, it's worthy reading material, even for those not interested in &quot;end of the millenium&quot; fiction (I don't know where the reviewer got that, in all honesty; I was expecting some sort of futuristic apocolypse), and it made me look at current events such as Kosovo and Belgrade in a whole new light.	2000-10-05

Once I picked it up, though, there was no putting it down 'til it was all over.  ...I didn't think it was too long. It's an epic work, and like all epic works, it's long and involved, requiring a committment from the reader--one well worth it. Una's character is vividly, marvelously drawn, as are the characters she comes in contact with, from Kit to Ahab to Ishmael and all the rest inbetween. Naslund has become one of my new favorite authors, and Ahab's Wife has become one of my new favorite books.	2000-07-25

It's not too hard to get used to those  devices however, and the story is generally a solid, well-told one, perhaps  because of those devices. The characters, however minor, all seem  important, and the reader gets to know each one precisely because they all  narrate at some point. The present tense action draws the reader in,  although it does at times feel forced. Moggach also does a superb job  blending the tulipomania and the story of Sophia and Jan--the social,  political, and economic background of the novel never dominates the story,  which often happens with historical and period pieces. We learn enough to  flesh out the plot and the characters, enough to make their actions seem  real and plausible, but we're not overburdened with extra info. And while I  could never really like Sophia, or Maria, or Jan, I could understand them  and their actions, their motivations, whether I agreed with them or not.  All in all, this novel is very readable.	2000-07-25

As Yolen says, &quot;... without tales and stories and books is to lose humanity's past, is to have  no star map for the future.&quot; Never before have I heard the case for  folk literature's preservation so succintly, so vividly, and so earnestly.

It makes for an  interesting story, to say the least. Originally written in Norwegian, the  story doesn't suffer from the translation (at least, not as far as I can  tell, since I'm not proficient in Norwegian!)--it's still a graceful yet  abrupt narrative, like Karin herself. My only quibble is that Karin doesn't  seem to change much over the course of the novel; she's rather static. I  was left wondering whether any of the novel's events would change her in  any way. Still, Ullmann has such a distinct voice, and Karin is such a  great character, that this book is well worth a read.	2000-07-17

Poetry has always made up a large part of my reading fodder, and this is one of the best. The poets here aren't well know  outside of Finland, but they all should be. Edith Sodergran is absolutely  mesmerizing. Her &quot;Vierge Moderne&quot; is one of the most powerful  works ever written in any language. Now I just wish I knew Swedish so I  could read these in the original, although from what I can tell, McDuff's  translations are incredible. (And who can beat that title! ) I know this  book isn't readily available on this site (when I ordered it, it was  unavailabe, and I had to get it from an--ahem--rival site), but it's well  worth the trouble of tracking down.	2000-05-19
US	50963139	RXSTRUAJW84UL	037540581X	869606125	The Missing World	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Enthralling	Margot Livesey paints these character portraits in such a deft manner, their inevitable intertwining seems not only natural, but outlined by Fate. Something of each reader surfaces in all these characters: Jonathon,  Freddie, Hazel, Maud, Charlotte, and on and on. Each one is human. Livesey  has done a superb job with them and with the explorations of memory. Hazel  and those whose lives touch hers each discover what memory-and  forgetfulness-mean to their lives. I couldn't put this one down.	2000-05-19

I didn't find Shapiro's narrator either believable or likable. Her prose is beyond reproach, but the characters-and the situation-didn't appeal to me, make me think, make me laugh, or in any way  really move my emotions. I would rather hate a novel than feel ambivalent  about it, as I do with this one.	2000-05-09
US	50963139	R1T4PYQZOTK8IK	006019541X	351520335	Blue Angel: A Novel	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Like a horror movie�	-you keep wanting to shout out to Swenson, &quot;No, stop! Don't do that!&quot; but he invariably goes upstairs, all the lights off, to investigate the strange noise.    This is my introduction to Francine Prose, and after reading Blue Angel, I think she's one of America's  strongest writers. She has a real ear for the English language and an eye  for appealing (or at least vivid) images. And her satire-beautiful,  intelligent, right-on-the-money satire-is close to unsurpassed.   Her  characters are also well-crafted: the reader can find a bit of himself or  herself in both Swenson and Angela, Magda and Sherry, Lauren and Carlos.    I highly recommend this book.	2000-05-09
US	50963139	R15ASFIYUJA96	052594527X	858318999	Girl With a Pearl Earring	Books	4	20	26	N	N	Beautifully written	Girl with a Pearl Earring deserves the praise it has garnered. Chevalier writes with precision, creativity, and intelligence, and her prose can only be described as lyrical. It's a slim volume and easily read, which I found  a slight disappointment. Given the complexity of Griet and Vermeer--and of  the novel's situation--I expected more complexity from the plot. Griet's  situation seemed to resolve too easily. Nonetheless, Girl with a Pearl  Earring is well worth reading--and rereading. Griet is a fabulous  character, and Chevalier has done a magnificent job bringing her to life.	2000-01-24
