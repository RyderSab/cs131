Just finished reading this strange book...of course most of Richard Laymons books are strange but good! I cannot get enough of his writing...so different. I would highly recommend this book in the long list of his books, never a dull moment and the ending is great.  <br /> <br />However, I would not really call this a horror novel (scarey in a few places), it is more of a relationship novel about some kids and their fears. Kind of creepy in a few places.  <br /> <br />Highly recommend!!	2005-08-24

There are some suspensful moments and a few scarey ones but I would not put this book in the horror catigory.  <br />The only thing that bothered me about this book is the fact that you don't know what or who the monster is for a long time. I guess that was intentional, trying to draw out the suspense.  <br />Frank Peretti is a Christian and this is a Christian book. Needless to say any critisism about his main theme evolution, is rediculous. Needless to say, if you want a fun, fast and entertaining read this is the one!	2005-04-18

If you read &quot;the Relic&quot; from these same authors and liked it you will enjoy this book. I absolutly love the humor the author's use in this story to lighten things up a bit. This book really opens up your imagination and takes you back in history to another time and place. The characters fit in each situation, even Detective Pendergast who is quiet a character! He cracks me up with his comments and dry humor.<BR>You will not be disappointed in this book!! I highly recommend it! Lincoln and Child have done it again!!!	2003-07-24

I absolutly loved \\"Certain Prey\\" the 10th novel in the Prey Series. \\"Mortal Prey\\" is the 13th novel in the Prey Series and it is as good, if not better than \\"Certain Prey.\\" <BR> A woman who is a hired hit-man, or should I say hit-person to be politically correct...Clara Rinker is one of those characters that you read about and can't forget because of her lack of respect for life. This time around in \\"Mortal Prey\\" Clara looses one person she would have loved and protected, her unborn baby. Her boyfriend is taken down by a hit man and Clara goes down with him but survives, yet looses her unborn baby. Needless to say we find out early in the novel who the hit-man was really after....<BR>Without giving the whole story away Clara gets really mad and goes on a killing spree. Enters, Lucas Davenport detective.<BR> This is another brilliant novel in the Prey series! John Sanford has done it again.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!<br />Just a note. You really should read the series from the very beginning to give this book justice. It would be hard to understand what is going on, especially in Lucas Davenports (the main character) life and other main characters in the book. This is the best detective series I have ever read! You won't be disappointed!	2002-05-22

Checked this book out in our local library about five years ago and I must say, this book is as good as any Jeff Long book or Dean Koonz book. This book literally gave me the creeps. In fact it was so good I am going to purchase a copy for myself off of Amazon. <BR>The story is very unusual in that it is unlike anything I have ever read before. Far fetched but at the same time scares the daylights out of you just thinking about it. <BR>Lets face it. Opening up a door and looking down into a bottomless pit in your home with creatures in it, that are coming after you is enough to hold the interest of the most avid horror reader.<BR>Highly recommend!! This is one of those finds that knowone knows what you are talkin about when you mention it to them, until now! You won't be disappointed!	2002-05-17

I have to say, I was alittle disappointed with this book. The romance in the story was pretty good, but toward the last part of the book I started getting bored. I hate to say that about a Diana Palmer book but this is not one of her best. I did like Reys character and Meredith was sweet but for some reason I just couldn't get to interested. <BR>Not a bad book.

I absolutly loved the characters, Kate and Alex.

For some reason I like the &quot;virgin&quot; or &quot;almost virgin&quot; storylines. They are corny but make the story more interesting. I especially liked the match between Gabe and Maggie. What a pair! Gabe is what you would call one of those &quot;Cowboy, Hunks.&quot; And Maggie was crazy in love with him from the time she was a teenager. Gabe being a bit on the &quot;rough&quot; side in the the beginning of the story made it all the more interesting.

And lets face it girls, Jon, is as hunky as they come, even if he is a \\"beast\\" at times! We need to remember, this is make believe, not real! That is why we read these books.

I just had a hard time giving it five stars because of the rediculous conclusions Julie (the female star of the book) always came to concerning her life being in danger. Oh, come on! If someone were telling me these things and strange things started to happen to me and my friends around me, wouldn't I take it at least alittle bit seriously?? That part was kind of frustrating to me.That someone could be that dumb! I kept waiting for her to say, Oh, my life is really in danger!! Well, duh!!!!!!!<br />Anyway, aside from that little anoyance the book was well written, and was really suspensful at the end. The romance was few and far between but that is okay. The male character was a Hunk and of course every womans dream come true! This book is worth reading if you like a good mystery, romance book.	2002-03-14

I have to confess, I picked up this book on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised at the imagination of Jeff Long. What an Author!! This book is probably one of the most well written books I have read in quiet a while. I would put Jeff Long in the same catagory of James Byron Huggins (&quot;Cain&quot;, &quot;The Reckoning&quot;). <BR>If you like to be &quot;creeped out&quot; this book will do the job. When one of the main characters in the book crash lands in a fog of poisonous gases and is forced to walk over bones of half eaten humans...well that is just the start of the nightmare....<BR>If you like horror and sci-fi mixed in with all kinds of creepy stuff you will not be dissapointed!	2002-01-11

Did I read the right reviews on this book?? Bought it based on the reviews and was very dissapointed. The stories were lame and unrealistic. The romance, so-so. I attempted to read each story and was so bored I ended up skimming through most of the book.

I have probably read this book at least five times and never get tired of it, it sizzles with sexual tension, and delivers with a love scene that keeps you breathless!! This book provokes feelings like no other romance book I have ever read. I wanted to cry at times, laugh at the humor of Faith and Gray, and fan myself at the love scenes. Like I said it doesn't get any better than this! Hold on girls for a wild ride!! Gray delivers like no other man in any other romance novel!!!	2001-12-21

After reading &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; not to long ago, I was alittle disappointed in &quot;Open Season&quot;.  This book could have been better, I thought the plot was alittle shallow and kind of silly.  The romance between Daisy and the town Sheriff keeps you laughing and the love scenes are well....I won't go there!  If Ms. Howard would have stayed with the girl in the first chapter of the book, this would have been a much better book, I was very interested in her story more than Daisy's. I gave this book four stars for the romance and the funny part concerning condoms, this is one of the funniest things I think I have ever read!  What can I say, Read and judge for yourself!	2001-08-06

Nicholas and Aurora are certainly suited for eachother, it seems like all they think about is sex..of course the name of the book is The Passion, so what else would the book be about??? The story is very well written, and even the love scenes do not leave alot to be desired, if you get my meaning.  The only part of the book that bothered me was Aurora's constant whineing about her long lost love, Gregory. She thought of him so much I was beginning to wonder if Nicholas was Gregory pretending to be Nicholas! I also was finding myself actually feeling sorry for Nicholas for being saddled with a wimp who couldn't make up her mind about which man she was going to love.. Aside from that, I did enjoy this book, enough to give it five stars. You are never bored with the story and lets face it, Nicholas is quiet the hunk (But of course, would he be anything else???) Enjoyable read! Just be prepared to turn on the air-conditioning!!	2001-07-16

All of the reviewers gave this book five stars, did I miss something??? I wouldn't call this book bad but it was more long winded chatter than romance....The romance in the book is good, but Lori Foster does not really focus on that, she goe's on and on about Cliff and his relationship to his sister, and well a bunch of other stuff that doesn't matter in a romance novel...

After reading boths books in this series I can say the only disappointment is at the ending of the \\"Jurassic Park\\" book .... I was alittle surprised when Crighton never addressed this in the beginning of the \\"Lost World\\", what a fantastic story that would make.

This is the first Nicole Jordan book I have ever read, and I am in the process of puchasing every book I can get my hands on by her. The story is very sensual and gripping and very sad at times.

This is one of the good ones. I had this book read in under two days.  If you are a fan of Lucas Davenport, you will not be disappointed. I hope John Sanford continues to grace us with the &quot;Prey&quot; books. One word of advice, these series books really need to be read from the first book through to the newest book to really understand the development of all the characters. I don't think this particular book can be appreciated unless you have read all of the other &quot;Prey&quot; books.  I strongly recommend that you read this series, you will not be disappointed!!	2001-07-06

What a STUD! If my husband is like Jake when He is 50ish I am going to lock him up in a cage!  Kidding aside, I really enjoyed this book. The only part I didn't like was Jake obsessing with his dead wife,however...that did add alittle sexual tension between him and Zoe. I also likes Zoe's character, she was a strong woman who was not afraid to show or say her feelings, and she definitly knew what a catch her hero Jake was. Go for it girl!
