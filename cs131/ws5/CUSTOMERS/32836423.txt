David McCullough's writing is so perfect that the reader feels he is right there witnessing the battles alongside the characters on both sides.  The book is extremely well researched, and as a historical work, is very well detailed.  McCullough knows the subjet matter very well, and understands the feelings of each characters. He is fair to both sides, the English and Patriots alike. He does not bash, but tells it the way it was. British General Howe, George Washington, Charles Cornwallis, General Green and many others find their name well represented throughout the book.  The British won many battles, Kips Bay, Brooklyn, Fort Washington, White Plains, but you find yourself cheering the Americans when they finally turn around their luck and win at Trenton and then Princeton.  General Washington, defeated at first, is commanding in his comeback, and becomes the real hero of the American Revolution. He is not a great strategist or even a great commander, but his faith in the cause, his remarkable patience and tenacity ultimatly allows him to become a great figure. He is a towering figure among his troops.  Washington never despaired and his tenacity for the \\"cause\\" is well documented throughout the book.  Very well written and fun to read.  No wonder David McCullogh is a national treasure. I can't wait for his next work.	2005-09-26

Ron Chernow's book is marvelous and eloquant.  While reading this book, you will not only be amazed at the accomplishements of the Morgans and their close advisors, but also at how they were able to make themselves the dominant force on Wall Street. Also fascinating here, is how they were able to help our nation become the richest and most successful financial enterprise ever.  J.P Morgan has had a lasting effect on American and overseas finances and industrialization. Governments came to them for financial backing in time of need, wars and economical crises. Their dominant position in the financial markets saved England and America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Without their input and capital, none of it would have been possible. They were the pioneers, George Peebody, the patriarc, even shook the English financial establishment into a new financial era. Today's Wall Street is no longer the place it once was, where gentlemen could shake hands on deals and had enough class to compete in good faith. The Morgan Guaranty building, the place where J.P. Morgan conducted his affairs, (If you travel downtown , you can still see the bullet holes on the building recalling that famous attack on Wall Street in the early twenties)is still standing, empty though. It was not all perfect, but for the most part it was a world that many envied. Many wanted to emulate them. The Morgans were true patriots, and loved their country. They traveled the world around to promote American capital (China, Europe and Japan) allowing it become the most powerful entity in world trade.   In this book, Ron Chernow is eloquant and detail oriented. He does not miss a single point. He has done his research and made sure that all types of readers could enjoy this book.  Remarkable, straight forward and Highly recommended	2005-09-01

For anyone who still does not understand why we are in Iraq today, may I suggest this fantastic book, written by a journalist who gave his life to allow us to really understand what is going on in Iraq. Before you believe all the hatred and negative analysis of the war in Iraq from the press, the America haters and the Islamofascits, read this book.  This book allows us to understand what the man on the street (Cab Drivers here) really think of the American liberation of their country.   What do these liberals really know about life in Iraq before Saddam was toppled ? Did they actually talked to the people who had to endure his tyranny, his torture chambers, and his death squads? Did they talked to the people who were massacred by the thousands? Where were they when their appeals for human rights were so needed? Do they really undertand what is going on in the Middle East? Do they really believe that all we want is their oil? Have they talked to the soldiers who are putting their lives on the line for us? Do they really understand anything ? Or is it just cliches that they repeat over and over ?   Steven Vincent, right after 9/11, unlike the critics, decided to go to Iraq and live among the people who matter the most here. The people who are right in the middle of it. Sometimes he tells us comical stories, like the one time he was meeting the pompous Canadian star, or the Code Pink women's group. What is not funny though, is their total ignorance on historical facts and their stupidity, which is actually dangerous.   Before I read this book, I knew a lot about Iraq, I also understood the real consequences of not acting before the terrorists regained their strength, but I was not a 100% sure that liberating Iraq was really needed. Now, my mind is clear, and I support it 150%. America has a lot at stake here, and not only will we succeed, but we will participate in making the lives of 30 million Iraqis better and more secure. That is a noble cause enough for me.   Cindy Sheehan lost her son in the war. we are all very sorry for her loss, but he died a hero and he will be remembered, for ever, as one of the soldiers who gave his life for the protection of his country, for the liberation and the hope of millions of young Iraqi children. Because, you see, it is about the children and their future. One more thing here, for the children of Iraq freedom cannot have come sooner.  Thank you Steven for your work of courage and for allowing us to understand what is really going on in Iraq.  The terrorist took away his life, but they can't take away his words.  God bless him.	2005-08-30

Ben Hogan, already the greatest golfer of his generation, seemed to be reaching out for his last glory. <br />It seems that the sport is no longer as elegant as it once was because the characters are no longer as heroic as they once were. <br />Highly recommended and a very good book to read over and over. <br />	2005-08-30

If one wants to really understand why the conservative party in America has become the dominant force in american politics, well read this book. It will give you a detailed historical account of the conservative movement, it will explain to you how and why America is the way it is today and why it is such a successful enterprise.  Fair and Balanced, as our friends at the Fox network would say. Not only is it very well written, but it is an account from two outsiders who happen to be outstanding British writers.  For two European writers to write a fair account of the American conservative movement, after all that garbage, hatred and complete ignorance coming out of the European press, the political establishment and, my personal favorite, the out of touch European intellectuals, this is truly refreshing. One seems to feel that these young writers are wishing the same to happen to their own countries.  After the 2004 American presidential election, the French Defence minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, declared, \\"the USA is a country we don't really understand and don't really know\\" Oh ! really, Madame la Ministre, where have been for the past 30 years and how did you ever get to the job you are currently holding ? How about traveling the USA instead of just visiting NYC, Washington DC and San Franscisco the next time you decide to come here, and make stupid remarks. So out of touch, but predictable to say the least. And she is a member of the French conservative party herself !   This book is right on, has great details, is well written and is very enjoyable. If you are a conservative you will love it and feel vindicated, if you are a liberal you will hate it and feel humiliated.  GREAT BOOK, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !	2005-08-30

Great strength comes with great responsibilities, and the US has certainly done so. We are the most powerful nation on the planet, we give more money away than anybody else, we are willing to sacrifice our young men for other people's problems, and not only that, but we are the only ones who can do it because of our democratic ideas and freedom. Just like the author describes in this book, America has had two main interests since it birth, to create the greatest democracy in the world and to protect itself from foreign interventions.  This country has been through many crises, but has always bounced back. WWI, WWII, Korean War, Vietnam, 9/11 and now Iraq.   Having lived in Europe for 16 years, I truly believe that we are the envy of the world.  The left always complains that our country acts like an imperial power, but let's not forget that if it looks that way, it is because we need to protect our interests in order to survive.  Also, the Iraq war, well here again, the killers and terrorists have decided to take us on within our own borders by killing in a matter of 30 minutes 3,850 of our fellow citizens. We did not ask for this war, they brought it to us.   I say this book is great for four reasons, 1) it is a great history tool, 2) it allows the reader to really understand why this country has been so successful,3) why it is crucial for America to be the protector of democracy in order to help others defeat communism and tyranny 4)and why the USA is the most compassionate country on the face of the earth. And this coming from a Frenchman !!.  As the author states, \\"You have heard all the lies now hear the truth\\". So true and so well said!!  Great book, well written and very enjoyable.

It seems as soon as one finishes a World War II book there is another great one out there. This is truly one of those.  Great story line and a lot of fun to read. The 10th mountain division is one that is not as well known to the general public but should be. Having lived in Europe myself and attended Prep school in the mountains, this story brought back a lot of great memories of the Alps.  These guys were truly great, and it is interesting to read about European ski stars, instructors, famous explorers, Prep School boys and IVY Leaguers wanting to join the US mountain division to fight the Nazis.  Even though they never really got to use their Skiing and climbing talents to fight the war, as the author states at the end of the book, they were nontheless great warriors.  Their entry in the war was a late one, but their service to the cause and their country was a noble one.  The Bob Dole segment is also very interesting and the author takes great care to make us understand what war was like during the Second World War. He also takes great care in telling us what warfare does to soldiers under constant bombardement.  Good read and a great compliment to other WWII stories.  This is a story about heroes.  Soldiers never die they just fade away (General McCarthur)	2005-08-08

Some of the stories in this book are just incredible and fascinating. Not just some State Department false overview. This is real down and dirty reporting.  It is a strong representation of what China is all about. The bad and the good.  Very well written with many great details.  The authors know their stuff well and have done some incredible research to write this great book.  For anyone who is fascinated by China, its history, culture, social and political structures, this is a book for them.  I knew something about China, but this book taught me much more.  It's like I was there seeing it with my own eyes.  Dated but very much needed if one wants to know why China is where it is today.  Should we be worried about a rising China, NO, should we be amazed, YES.  Wonderful book and very readable.	2005-08-01

If you live in New York City and have ever met a NYC cop, well you will really like this book. This is a great story, with a lot of unknown information. If you want to find out how a NYC police officer spends his days, how hard the JOB is, and how difficult it is to deal with such a huge bureaucratie such as the NYPD, daily crimes and perps then you will really enjoy this book.  It is normal for a guy like Mr. Collon to tell us about his family in order for us to understand why he decided to join the force. It is part of him, it is in his blood. Again if you live in New York City, in Queens, Brooklyn,the Bronx and Manhattan then you will understand why family background for these young cops is important.  These are stories about real people written by a real good cop.  Life for a police officer is real tough and these guys put their lives at risk for us everyday. Once you read this book you will understand why they need our respect.So many people are out of touch with real life, not these guys.   He is also a graduate of Harvard University, so we surely can understand why it might be difficult for his peers to understand why he joined the force. This is why he goes back to his family background.  In any case, this is a great book, funny with great stories.  You'll get the real inner workings of the NYPD, and you will smile while you read about it.	2005-07-11

This book will tell you all you really need to know about this great man.  The latest movie about Howard Hughes is nothing compared to this book. What was Hollywood thinking when they decided to make this movie? It did not say anything about his Vegas ventures, which was a crucial time in his life. If one knew about his time in the Flamingo hotel, it would have been easy to relate to his crazyness, mentality and thinking. Nothing also was mentioned in the movie about his voyages around the world, which started it all, and his life after his aviation follies. I know the movie was called \\"The Aviator\\", but if you did not know anything about Howard before you saw the movie, then all you would think was that he was some crazy aviator who wasted his time building a giant aircraft that was never used for military or commercial purposes, dated a movie star and was always concerned that the US government was out to distroy him. (Well, the government tried really hard!!)  Who knows, maybe Airbus engineers had Howard Hughes in mind when they build their latest aircraft, the giant A380.  Mr. Hughes will be forever the pioneer who started it all.  In this book though,his life and his legacy are well preserved.  It is very well written, it tells use about his dramatic life, his eratic lifestyle and behavior, his connections to everything that was going on in the US at the time, and his constant drive for perfection. Hero or not, he was sometimes crazy but also brilliant.  If one really wants to know who Howard Hughes really was, all questions will be answered here. This book will tell you everything.

The author, a truly great historian, once again, provides the readers with a truly remarkable account of the truth behind the policies of the war in Iraq. Unlike all the deranged arguments from the liberals, John Keegan tells us all the historical and real reasons why the U.S and Great Britain took the courageous path to liberate and change the course of history in Iraq.  He allows us to understand the historical, political, and cultural aspects of the importance of our current policies.  As you read his book, is it easy to understand how our sacrifice will help reshape the future of the region. Too many people have suffered under the dictator, and too many people have been lied to by the Hussein government.  As you get to the final chapters of the book, one will also understand how successful this campaign has been, and how the military has conducted itself in a great manner to bring a fast and secure victory for the people of the region. Much still has to be accomplished to bring stability and peace to Iraq, however unlike the liberal press's view point and final analysis, Iraq is truly a better place then it once was.  The final phrase of the book defines this campaign beautifully.  \\"The reality of the Iraq campaign of March-April 2003 is, however, a better guide to what needs to be done to secure the safety of our world than any amount of law-making or treaty-writing can offer\\".  Music to our ears.    Bravo !!  Senator John Kerry, John Edwards and Democatric Party, please read this book and stop making stupid remarks.	2004-07-11

Bravo Bill Sammon, and thank you for telling us what other Bush haters (liberal authors and writers) are not capable of telling us. <BR>I just finished this book and I keep telling myself, why are liberals so dumb,and why don't they ever get it.
