Why, dozens of high quality COLOR pictures, some double full page layouts! This is worth the price of the book alone.    PROS  1. Fantastic color pictures! Some of these are as nearly as good as you would see in `Travel and Leisure' or `Conde Naste'.   2. Good selections of topics and activities covered.  3. Honest opinions of that they review. (Not all that I agree with!!!!)  4. Wonderful detailed maps!  5. Good layout and quick reference pages.  6. Great coverage of beachs, with photos!    CONS  1. The writing, flat colorless prose, lacking the vibrant rainbow of color, scents, and sounds that Hawaii deserves. (A problem with the whole series of books)  2. Their `Best Of' at the end of each area is not very helpful, it's supposed to be funny I think but no one I know finds it to be so. A Best expensive / moderate / cheep seafood or Best beach for swimming / romance / surfing, would be more helpful.  3. This is not as detailed or as comprehensive as their other guide books, part of the problem is the amount of things to cover on Oahu, part of the problem possibly is less research and time spent on this book compared with some of the others that they took years to write.  4. Some of thier reviews are way off in my oppinion, one restraunt that they liked is terrible (Maui Taco), and some that they did not like are good!	2005-06-02

The weaknesses are in the uninspired plot, the unlikable and weird characters, and their highly unconvincing motivations (except for the cat, which is by far the most enjoyable character). <br />We are supposed too believe in the main character who has a PhD in English from Berkley, is an unlicensed private investigator, and a Tie Chi master. He's also broke, drunk, slovenly, mentally unstable, anti-social, and not to bright. But he has a nice cat.

This book also has the most idiotic ending that you can possibly imagine, I won't spoil it, but what would you sentence a serial killer too, I bet it would not be what Mr. Brown comes up with! <br />While I enjoy the Polynesian/Hawaii culture and history very much [their rich and vibrant history is an essential part of the seduction of Hawaii], Mr. Brown seems to have developed a sycophantic attraction to the indigenous people here.<br />The worst thing about these books are that, Mr. Brown's (from Michigan) preaches a very pro-indigenous view point in his books, he is extremely one sided in his arguments, he finds only the most laudable traits about the Polynesian people of Hawaii. He misses the fact that they were EXTREAMLY warlike, they practiced the most extreme form of aristocratic class domination, had human sacrifice, and put people to death for VERY minor crimes, and treated women as property. <br />Mr. Brown does not seem to understand that the \\"Polynesian people of Hawaii\\" have nearly died out, many who claim to be \\"Hawaiian\\", are mostly something else, but are looking for political power [money] at the expense of the rest of the people living in Hawaii. <br />A disturbing aspect of these books is that Mr. Brown does not seem know that \\"Haole\\" is a racial insult aimed at white people, just as the \\"N\\" word is for African Americans, and the \\"G\\" word is for Asians!<br />Leave off on the political preaching and these books would be a much more enjoyable read!     <br />Also his use of Hawaiian terms constantly throughout the book gets a bit much, even for a Kama'aina.   <br />OVERALL SCORE: (C-)<BR>READABILITY: (C+), PLOT: (C-), CHARATERS: (B-), DIALOGUE: (C-), SETTING: (A+), ACTION/COMBAT: (C-), ANTAGONISTS: (B-), ROMANCE: (B-),AGE LEVEL: (PG)<br />I would recommend,if you want GREAT Hawaii mystery/adventures; Charles Knief's Books \\"Diamond Head\\", \\"Green Flash\\", \\"Sand Dollars\\", and especially \\"Silversword\\"!  <br />Mahalo nui loa!	2003-12-28

This well written thriller has all that you could ask for in a mystery novel, action, suspense, a good plot, and some romance on the side. <br />Mark Brown captures much of the feel of Hawaii, the sights, sounds, and the feel of the tropical paradise. The only discordant note in this otherwise excellent novel, is the authors complete misunderstanding of race relations in Hawaii. A major theme is the racism of the white controlled police department only giving promotions to white officers, and how this effects this effects Ben McMillen the 'hapa' police detective and his mentor Tobi. This could not be further from the truth here in Hawaii, ( Hawaii Police Chief Lawrence Mahuna, Deputy Chief Harry Kubojiri, Hawaii Mayor Harry Kim, Council Chairman James Arakaki) the use of this tired and overused crutch of anti-white racism is getting old, especially when in Hawaii it's the other way around.<br />While I enjoy the Polynesian/Hawaii culture and history very much [their rich and vibrant history is an essential part of the seduction of Hawaii], Mr. Brown seems to have developed a sycophantic attraction to the indigenous people here.<br />OVERALL SCORE: (B+)<BR>READABILITY: (A-), PLOT: (B), CHARATERS: (B), DIALOGUE: (B-), SETTING: (A+), ACTION/COMBAT: (B-), ANTAGONISTS: (B), ROMANCE: (B-), SEX: (Light), AGE LEVEL: (PG)<br />I would recommend; Charles Knief's Books Diamond Head, Green Flash, Sand Dollars, and especially Silversword, if you want GREAT Hawaii mystery/adventures!  <br />Mahalo nui loa!	2003-12-27

Sprague De Camp and Lin Carter in the 70's, I had hoped that the original stories as written by Howard himself would be even beter. Unfortunately, I did not like this book nearly as much; the action lacked the emotional impact and violence, the stories were very short and `patchy', the flow was at times difficult and unnatural, the scenes were not as vibrantly depicted and lacked the color and feel that De Camp and Carter gave to them, and worse was the characters themselves, they lacked depth, intensity, likeability, and charm..<br />Instead of this book I would recommend, and much preferred either the De Camp/ Carter series, or \\"The Conan Chronicles, Volume 1\\" and \\"The Further Chronicles of Conan\\", by Robert Jordan.<br />OVERALL SCORE: (C)<br />PLOT: (C), CHARATERS: (C-), DIALOGUE: (C-), SETTING: (C), ACTION/COMBAT: (C), ANTAGONISTS: (B-), ROMANCE: (B+), SEX: (Light), AGE LEVEL: (PG)	2003-12-26

This is by far the worst Conan book that I have read, no contest; it's so bad it's laughable. <BR>The author must have been sitting at home, eating popcorn watching Mel Gibson in Bravehart, and thought, \\"This would make a great Conan Story, sure changes some stuff so as to not have to pay royalties to the producers, but why not!\\" <br />Why is it so bad?<BR>1. Conan and his people are barbarians (think early Viking, Visigoths, Huns, etc.), but the Author has them living in a village straight out of the late middle ages, they have streets, they have multi room houses (many frontier American log cabins as well as most European peasants had single room homes well into the 19th century), they have a black smith with a bellows forge (middle ages tech), and their homes are thatched roofed, (yes, thatched, not animal skin, sod, or timber, but thatch, wrong climate and tech for barbarians). \\"Say, Conan, could you shovel the two tons of snow out of the living room--- again\\". <BR>2. The Barbarians, have a tight laced Victorian morals (no really, you didn't know that well---) It seems that a people who have a life expectancy of no more than 30 years, were most girls would be married and have kids by their mid teens, well these Barbarians get all up tight about a 14 year old girl and a Count, (The author brings this up again and again, it's a central plot element).<BR>3. Conan, the hard fighting, hard drinking, hard whenching Barbarian hero, in this book is so shy he's afraid to talk to the village girl he's sweet on. (No stop laughing, it gets even weirder). Conan's character it seems is the creepy Bates guy straight out the movie Psycho, \\"Yes, Mother. Can I get you anything Mother? Let me do that for you MOTHER!\\" can we say obsequious!  <BR>4. It seems that people while engaged in melee combat have the time, (and breath) to engage in long polite discussions with their opponents and friends, the battle scenes are the worst and least credible I have read, period.  (Perhaps, theauthor should have been watching Russell Crow, in Gladiator, would have helped him more than Mel did.)<BR>5. Conan's mother is dieing from a lung illness, (sounds like tuberculosis), she's been dieing for years we are told, she's in the end stage of the disease, she goes though another sub artic winter, and another, and another and just lives on!!!! (A person with TB confined to an early 20th century sanitarium with the best treatment would probably have had a life expectancy of only a few weeks given her symptoms, what an amazing miracle!)<BR>6. The dialog doesn't flow all that well, and there are just soooooo many other logic and technical problems in this book, that its really just that bad!	2003-11-08
