Streams of Silver  3.5 stars rounded to 3    Every hero needs a villain! We get the villain in the second book of the Icewind Dale trilogy as well as a much better, though fairly derivative, plot.     Salvatore has improved immensely in this book compared to the weaker Crystal Shard entry. Characterization is a little better as he focuses in on Bruenor and Drizzt, and the plot is much tighter.     The best thing about this book is the introduction of the assassin Artemis Entreri. Supremely skilled, coldly calculating, ruthless and utterly evil he is not only the equal of Drizzt in swordsmanship but also in intelligence. A mirror image of Drizzt with pragmatism replacing compassion. With a little bit of the reader's willing sense of disbelief he provides a sense of real peril for our heroes.     Some of the side trips, particularly the Harpell's are well done and amusing. The expendable villains are also competently portrayed.

What the collection does is allow you to save some decent money and get 3 books for about the price of 2 which is always a welcome bonus.  <br /> <br />Two 4-star books, and one 3-star book in which the primary strengths of the books are the development of the drow culture, cities and the underworld setting. <br /> <br />Homeland-4 stars: <br />There are really two main characters in this book, the first character is Drow culture, the second character is Menzoberranzen. The actual flesh and blood characters are there to exposit the features of the culture and the city.  <br /> <br />Though the story is fairly decent, the action scenes are well done and the purported main character Drizzt himself is sympathetic, though to my mind far too naive, the novel is more important as being the influence and foundation for how Dark Elves are viewed and used in fiction, particularly TSR fiction.  <br /> <br />The culture Salvatore more or less created is rich with detail and story potential. The houses, acadamies and religion of the drow are like early empire Rome, or a Victorian British society viewed through a dark mirror in Hades. With political, magical and armed warfare permitted and sanctioned by their goddess conflict is rife in the setting allowing many stories to flow. <br /> <br />Exile-4 stars: <br />Due to seeing more of the Underdark besides Menzoberranzen I rate this just a shade better than the previous Homeland. We not only get to see the fun and interesting Drow culture of betrayal and backstabbing but we also get to see both deep gnomes and mindflayer cities in relatively decent exposition.  <br /> <br />As in Homeland the strengths are again in the settings and the action. The characters are still not well developed though they are portrayed more realistically than in Homeland. Drizzt remains likeable though his near saintliness and melee prowess do make it a little annoying. Clacker the transformed hook-horror ispossibly the most interesting, and heroic character, in the book followed by the undead Zaknafein. Drizzt is more like an angsty scimitar-wielding underdark tour guide.  <br /> <br />As in Homeland the portrayal of the cities, Menzo, the deep gnomes city and the mind-flayer lair are very good and the best parts of the book. The actual plot and Drizzt's struggle against his hermit/hunter self are not as interesting as the setting.  <br /> <br />Still though an entertaining read that moves quickly and pulls you along. <br /> <br />Sojourn-3 stars: <br />This book is very similar to the previous Exile. It consists of a series of vignettes of Drizzt travelling and fighting of course. However this book takes place on the surface and without the very interesting setting of the Underdark and the complex Drow culture it is nowhere near as interesting.  <br /> <br />Drizzt has made it to the surface and he tries to find a home amongst the surface dwellers. At this point in his life he is seemingly far too naive in his attempts at interacting with the other races of the Forgotten Realms. For a villain we have essentially a redneck bounty hunter who continues to pursue Drizzt to receive more punishment in each meeting.  <br /> <br />The action is still good, but the lack of the Underdark as a setting, the lack of the Drow culture and a buffoonish villain rather than the future Artemis Entreri or Drizzt's own kin make this inferior to the previous two novels in the trilogy. <br />	2005-08-23

Though Superman is the featured hero we have prominent roles played by both civilians and the other major JLA members.<br /><br />  The best parts of the novel are the very basic, human interludes showing the heroes as people in their downtime. J'onn eating ice cream, Wally and Kyle getting chili.<br /><br />  Just as with the previous Hero's Quest though, the book starts well then slows. The plot takes some time to develop and the action scenes are not that well done after the Alaska disaster. The main problem is really too much exposition, too much telling and not enough showing. There were probably one or two superfluous minor weather disasters as well that could have been edited out. In particular the blizzard at the Atom's university.<br /><br />  These faults aside, the team effort of Batman, Superman and the rest of the JLA working together make this an above average entry in this series. I can only hope that the neglected Manhunter, the heart and soul of the JLA gets a novel.	2005-07-25
US	51985525	R12D36MFCOTBAG	0743417127	613039611	Green Lantern: Hero's Quest (JLA (Pocket Star))	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Physics, Existentialism and Meta-Physics?	2.5 stars      To me, Hal Jordan will always be Green Lantern. However I found the beginning of this work fairly strong. Kyle is endearing as a slacker and a loser who ends up with the ring. He's presented pretty well in having difficulties dealing with the ring and the rest of the JLA. It is a bit off-putting though to return to the alleged origin and see his best friend the Flash sneering at him for being irresponsible.      After we get rid of the rest of the JLA by magic, which is the one major suspension of disbelief the reader must get over in every one of these solo JLA novels, Kyle must rise to the occasion.      He does of course, but the story veers crazily at this point into a melange of hard-sf physics, meta-physics and existentialism. Rather than doing much of anything, Kyle engages in lengthy socratic dialogues with his Oan mentor and philosophizes on reality, immortality, the rights and responsibilities of power and on change. Now many of these things should be included in a superhero novel to elevate it above mere action but here it is overdone and done poorly.       The ending is also inadequate and very unbelievable. Other nonsense includes the idea that Oans created superheroes 10 years ago. Ok, sure, there are many different realities in the DC metaverse, but this is a series and the series must remain consistent. In this case we already have 3 generations of Flashes so this 10 years is nonsense.      Even as a standalone book, taken apart from the rest of the series the liberties taken with \\"known history\\" would be jarring and less than acceptable.      What I always loved about Green Lantern was the power of the ring that needed to be used with such creativity. Sadly we get little of that here as O'Neil one of the premier GL writers turns it into a hard-sf universe building novel mixed in with meta-physics, and existential philosophy.      To sum it up, the origin story and the hilarious satire of the action-adventure genre at the start was good. The last half was badly wanting.	2005-07-23

As well we see the extended JLA family and other DC heroes called in when things get to be too much for the core five members to handle on their own. <br /> <br />   The effective use of the ensemble cast alone makes it a good work. Enhancing it further is the maturity of the themes. We get some looks differing philosophies of the JLA members in regards to acceptable treatment of villains. We get to see the JLA work under duress, not finding an optimal solution, not liking that the solution is not optimal but doing what needs to be done at the time. <br /> <br />   At the end of the day the world is saved, but it is not joyous. The League wonders about their methods and second guesses themselves seriously. This fact and the character interactions of the heroes and the newly blossoming meta-humans make this work more mature and better than the previous novels in the series. <br /> <br />  Not necessarily a fun read, but it is a good one with things to think about.	2005-07-22

The author does a good job focusing on the Flash without ignoring the other members, or going out of the way to remove them from the scene so the Flash can take center stage. <br /> <br />  The Flash is nicely presented as a younger hero, very powerful yet insecure against the legends of the JLA, and the otherworldy antagonist is effectively creepy and interesting. <br /> <br />  After building up the powers of this extra-dimensional SuperLuminal in anticipation of the final encounter the author does the unforgiveable. From out of nowhere another hero summons the Flash to Quantum-Paradise and gives him godlike powers, temporarily, and advice on how to defeat the entity as well as a healthy dose of quantum physics hand-waving to explain the powers of the Flash. Afterwards the new powers go away, and so does the convenient savior albeit with a \\"shock revelation\\" <br /> <br />   So much promise with what had been a good character driven novel focusing on the Flash and his civilian and superhero life just thrown away by this Deus ex Machine ending.	2005-06-20

When they are out of the action to allow Wonder Woman to take center stage it is handled relatively well and isn't too unbelievable. The other JLA members are able to contribute without overwhelming Wonder Woman's importance <br /> <br />   One of the strengths of the book is the use of the normal woman. Secondary characters can make or break these books. As there really isn't going to be any earth shaking revelations about the JLA or massive character growth the handling of secondary characters is where the author gets a chance to portray such events. In this case, the minor character is handled very well to drive the plot forward, provoke interest and caring from the reader and provide some good humor. <br /> <br />  There are some weak and/or slow moments, particularly the time Wonder Woman spends on her home island. Once we reach one third of the way in though, the pace picks up and drives forward without being relentless. <br /> <br />   The flaws do not overshadow the strengths, nor do they prevent it from being an enjoyable read. Not a great read, but a fun read, and quite superior to The Stone King.	2005-06-17

When we read about superheroes, we all bring a huge amount of our willing suspension of disbelief to the book in order to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the author manages to kill that willing sense of disbelief here.       The biggest problem is how do we make a Batman book out of a JLA book. We of course have to get rid of the other heroes. How do we do that? Have them out of town reacting to another major issue? No, and I'm sure this is no spoiler, we incapacitate the mightiest heroes around with some magic so we can concentrate on Batman.       This is the biggest strike against the book. The underdeveloped villain and the marginal science of the disasters could easily have been overlooked, but on top of magically disabling the other members of the JLA it was just too much.       Grant's writing, particularly in the early sections of the book, seems much more suited to the graphic novel format rather than the prose novel. His writing to me seemed to scream \\"Panel here...panel there\\" as if he were giving instructions to the penciller of what to draw.       Despite including a couple of civilians in the plot, to try and put a human face on the disaster, I'm afraid that I didn't find it engaging, and really didn't care much about the fate of the world, Batman, or the disabled heroes.       Overall, not too terrible, but a bit of a chore to read.	2005-06-16

After all, Star Wars is a visual medium and the movies are the original voice of the creator. Thus the novelizations cannot help but exist in the shadow of the movie. <br /> <br />  The strengths of Stover's novelization are the added depth to the thoughts and motives of the prime players with conversations added and inner monologues revealed. He also dispenses with some of the silliness of the battle of Coruscant the movie engaged in. <br /> <br />  The most welcome extra exposition in particular are the background on Count Dooku, which makes his death much more deliciously ironic, and the extra background on the seeds of the Rebellion being planted which in addition to being of historical interest also serves to allow a wedge to be driven between Anakin and Padme and push him further into Palpatine's clutches. <br /> <br />  On the down side, the battles after the Count Dooku encounter were strangely sterile and antiseptic. For some reason they came across to me as being completely devoid of excitement on the printed page and that isn't always the case. <br /> <br />  I believe that this works best as a companion to the film not as a stand alone work. As I said at the start novelizations must exist in the shadow of the movie generally. The added exposition to what is happening in the movie makes the book worthwhile, I don't feel the actual story does.	2005-06-08

However the story suffers in comparison to A Kid's Game. <br /> <br />  The problem I believe is primarily Raven. Raven is a very very difficult character to sell to the reader. Despite the sympathetic background, the empath isn't a character that readers can warm up to. Add in the fact that the new Brother Blood is fairly goofy and the story really doesn't work. <br /> <br />  The part of the story that works well is the minor plot of Deathstroke and Ravager. Lovely uniform for Ravager, and great cold-hearted characterization as well. <br /> <br />  Development of the Titans both within the team and without continues, albeit slowly, very well. A true team spirit is beginning to develop. I hope the rebirth of the cold, aloof Raven does not forebode a bad turn in the camaraderie of the team.	2005-06-08

This new Titans though is quite impressive. <br /> <br />  Both the story and artwork are strong. The art in the comics medium continues to improve with each generation to the point where pencils, inks and colors are almost always technically excellent. <br /> <br />   The writer does a good job with both the reason for refounding the Titans and dealing with the new Titans. He very carefully walks the tightrope of portraying the teenagers accurately with angst, self-loathing and selfishness without making them unlikeable and turning off the reader. <br /> <br />   Both the new Titans and the returning Titans, Starfire, Cyborg and Changeling are treated well and portrayed well. The plot is fairly reasonable, though I don't totally buy the villains actions it was logically defensible. <br /> <br />   A very strong start to the new Titans.	2005-06-08

Certainly not an ending worth of the great starts his books have. In Quicksilver, Stephenson avoids this problem. There is no great beginning that peters out into a morass. Instead, the reader is thrown into the morass right away and never figures out exactly why they are in it, and how to get out. <br /> <br />  I'll have to join the chorus of those who have enjoyed all his previous works and found this wanting after looking forward to the hyped prequel to Cryptonomicon. In this chapter of \\"The Baroque Cycle\\" he not only writes about that period, but writes in the style of that period, as well as the later Victorian period. Imagine every long digression of Dickens or Hugo and you get the idea. Of course the digressions they choose were contemporay and if they related to minutia, it was at least current minutia. <br /> <br />   There are some good parts to this work, where the plot moves along reasonably quickly. They are few and far between though whereas such things as the 100 page trip to Paris to sell a horse predominate the book. Also schemes and plots and trips of the main characters are started, and then often stop, are abandoned and do not come to fruition. Realistic perhaps, but not satisfying thematically or stylistically in a work of entertainment. <br /> <br />   The characters are generally sympathetic, though not terribly interesting. Some of this is due to the extreme length of the book. Characters that seemed interesting at the start begin to wear out their welcome after 900 pages of their quirks. On the whole the only well defined character was Daniel Waterhouse. Jack Shaftoe, and Eliza were not well defined and seemed to contradict their very beings on occasion. <br /> <br />   This book took me over a month to finish. Now, true it is big, but an interesting 900 pager I'd finish in a week. Thiswas truely a Herculean effort to get through.  <br />  <br />   Where is Bach anyway, if this is the Baroque cycle? He would have been reaching maturity near the end of the time period this volume is set in. <br /> <br />   On the whole, this was not worth the effort put into reading it. I only hope that The Confusion makes it all worthwhile.	2005-04-05

I wish I could, but I can't. I can only review it as I enjoyed it current day. <br /> <br />  It is an argument to the strength of Stephenson's prose that a shallow, dated essay on GUIs and command line operating systems even gets 3 stars 5 years after being published. Analogy and whimsy are well-used by Mr. Stephenson here in discussing the different types of users and how they wish to interact with the machine. He makes a dry subject entertaining. <br /> <br />  Unfortunately, this many years past publication the world has move greatly on. Yes the command line vs. GUI worldviews have not changed, but neither has the freeing of OS's happened either. <br /> <br />  Additionally, beneath the whimsy and wordplay are only some nifty, but not fleshed out ideas almost laid down as truths. Stephenson needed to back up his ideas with some more evidence rather than thought experiment. <br /> <br />  Despite those faults though, it is an enjoyable, but now purposeless, read.	2005-03-11

The anger of Bruce Wayne, the anger of the exiled, entrapped and exploited superheroes. The anger of the readers who are looking at the hideous artwork.      The story is not good, but it is very enjoyable. Pure adrenaline and emotion drive it forward. Unlike the more scholarly Dark Knight Returns there is no reflection or pause in this work. We hit the ground running and only increase the pace of the plot as things move forward. The world is in sad shape, the heroes are angry and they are gonna get some of theirs back. Which makes for a great read. After finishing though you realize there wasn't that much there. Still though an excellent ride.      Other good things. Kara, the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman. The appearance of the Flash and the Atom. Wonder Woman herself. Bruce and Carrie's love.      Bad things. The portrayal of Superman. The artwork. The artwork verges from serviceable to horrific. The lack of any crisis of conscience for Superman when he finally sees the light of day. The simplistic story. The heavy handed politics. The artwork, the artwork, the artwork. The crazy Dick Grayson, what was that about? Characters and issues appearing and then disappearing. Saturn Girl anyone?       On the whole, a very good light read with very poor artwork. A not quite worthy successor to The Dark Knight Returns. Not much to think about, but emotionally powerful and driving while you read it.	2005-03-11

There are others and they are jarring. Sentences referring to events in different time periods being written in present tense, adjectives and adverbs mixed up. I wonder if Luceno really wrote this. It reads like a foreign author wrote it and did his own translation. Certainly the editor should be ashamed at the low level of basic english literacy displayed here.     Ok, grammar rant over. Plotwise we have another disappointing hardcover Clone Wars novel. Slow, unengaging, nothing happens until the one event at the end. Our main problem is Sidious/Palpatine. He just isn't an engaging, evil villain. He is such a great puppet master that everything always unfolds to his whims, even small errors are quickly turned to his advantage. There is just nothing there to like or hate about him, he's just a computer like plot device to get us to the asencion of the Empire.     Also, having the real world events of September 11th, 2001 and the phrase \\"triad of evil\\" in this book is really off-putting. Though I may agree with Luceno's comparisons of the policies of the two governments this Star Wars book is not the place for it.      General Grievous unfortunately after all the hyping in previous novels doesn't impress either. Of all the characters here he at least gets background exposition. Still though it fails to catch much interest of the reader. To a large extent, this happens to all the characters. At 330 or so pages, with 1.5 spaced text the characters get short shrift, appearing for a few pages, then gone until their spot in the line-up comes around again.      Some good things, the hunt for Sidious on Coruscant. The Jedi starting to finally wake up and think about becoming competent after being such blind dupes for Palpatine. However we know how it ends, and it is too little, too late. The frequent problem, as with theNew Republic novels, is nothing happens to the major characters resulting in the interesting books being about minor characters and backwater places, such as Hard Contact.      This book set the stage for the movie, the characters went through their roles mechanically, pushed to their marks by authorial fiat.	2005-02-06
US	51985525	R1SQ5JKJVAYGDP	1880418622	871670140	The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, Book 7)	Books	2	201	261	N	N	Anti-climactic Denoument - Spoilers Aplenty	2.5 stars, and I have to round down to 2, it doesn't deserve 3.  Beware, spoilers abound in this review. I do not feel it can be properly reviewed without the concrete examples that will spoil the plot.      It hurts me to have to more or less pan this book, I started reading of Roland in Fantasy and Science Fiction. Confusing stories, but brilliant. The trade paperback, then Drawing of the Three made it clear and they were brilliant. Now like a bit of unfinished business needing to be gotten out of the way the Dark Tower is swept out the door in a series of anti-climactic denouments.      The book is, of course, too long. Hey we expect that, and we can even like it. It is how King has written books for some time. However in this case with the help of Ted Brautigan the universe is saved early on and 2/3's of the book is a slow denoument as Roland continues on his quest to see the Dark Tower even though it no longer matters. Fair enough though, I've gone this far and I want to see it too.      We then have the ka-tet torn apart. I understand there are thematic and dramatic reasons for Roland coming to the tower alone, however the deaths of 3 of the ka-tet are inexcusable, overly-manipulative and pointless deaths to seemingly provoke an emotional response. Sacrificing one of the characters to save King's own life was just over the top. Having other versions of themselves meet in the epilogue doesn't make up for it.      Walter/Flagg, he needed to die, but as others have said it was for Roland to do so, not Roland's spider-baby. Roland becomes stupid at the end, falling for Dandelo, and not worrying enough about Mordred. Roland was one tough S.O.B., and one cunning smart bugger too, he would never be taken in that easily. Worse, after warning Susannah of bewaring the welcome at the court of the Crimson King, he falls for the same thing just a bit later?      The artist, Patrick Danville, was the hugest deus ex machine to drop from the mind of an author into the pages of a book ever. Was King just wanting to wrap it up so he said \\"Ok, I'll have a guy draw my way out of the corner.\\"?      There are good points, the ka-tet, Eddie, Jake, Oy are the noblest companions one could hope to have and live up to their literary predecessor Samwise Gamgee. Their deaths are a true waste. Despite their throwaway deaths though they are the real reason to have read this series. I also liked Whelan's art, and I'm not a real Whelan fan. It was much better than the horrible artwork in Song of Susannah. Algul Siento was very good, I'd be a breaker if I was put in a sweet setup like that. The story would have been well ended though at this point considering what was to come.      I wasn't bothered by the powerless Crimson King at the end of the book. After all, when the breakers were freed he was finished. If Mordred was bad enough to easily take Flagg down, some tainted meat should not have hurt him that badly. However it didn't bother me too much, it was obvious that he'd be dispatched by Oy and Roland, with Oy as the sacrifice.      The Coda was unforgiveable. Roland had learned to love, he had learned to grieve, his cries before the tower claiming Jake as his son proved so. To be thrown back into the story before book 1 starts with one symbol of change is not acceptable. Nor, Mr. King, is lecturing the readers who have paid your rent. I recognize I do not have the right to tell you how to finish your story, I do though hold the right to expect the enjoyable, fulfilling, purposeful epic you promised.      Let me dissect this further. If this is reincarnation, why does Roland not start as a baby? Following Walter through the desert is well into his middle years, he's lost Alain and Cuthbert, killed Susan and seen his world move on. Does this mean that after saving the beams and the tower, preserving the universe that just a few weeks later the universe is again in peril? We are supposed to accept this and believe that Roland's horn being part of hisgear this time shows he has progressed in some small way? Roland progressed greatly as he saved the universe. If he is to have peace in this incarnation it should have started with his birth, not setting him again on such a thorny path.      Neil Gaiman, on being asked why end The Sandman stated \\"Because stories that matter end!\\". Yes, stories that matter end. They don't have to have a happy ending, or a just ending, or a sad ending. The ending can even be the ending of that particular story, such as the Sandman was, indicating another story, many stories, go on. This was none of that. By pushing the reset button King insults all of us who put a lot of time into reading a story, that without an ending, does not matter.       23 years after starting the trade edition of The Gunslinger I am sorely disappointed.        Hile Roland, Jake, Eddie, Oy, and even Susannah, you deserved better than your maker gave you.	2005-01-18

I think of the 400 pages at least 200 consisted of the various Susannahs talking to each other, sometimes in their head, sometimes going todash to a western town, or medeival castle, but talking, talking, talking. <br /> <br />  It seems as we reach the end of the series there is still so much left to explain that it has to come in lengthy passages of exposition and rather than showing us, King chooses to tell us, primarily through the conversations of Susannah and Mia. <br /> <br />  I can also be counted amongst those who did not like King making his appearance as a mover and shaker and creator of worlds(but not the real world, or the Tower). However I am happy that he portrayed himself as a not so pleasant, or useful guy. That fact made it a little more bearable. <br /> <br />  Plotwise and action-wise, nothing really happens here which was disappointing. On the whole a very disappointing chapter of the story. <br /> <br />	2005-01-11

Though not enough exposition to bore the reader. With this added space we get to see some old favorites return, and some great new characters.<br /><br />  The tone is dark and confused, Harry is an angry young man as he deals with his encounter with Voldemort alone and with no support other than the Dursleys. Harry finds the truths of his world on shaky ground as Hogwart's comes under the dominion of a particularly hideous Defense Against the Dark Arts teach, and later acting headmaster, Umbridge. Harry and Dumbledore find themselves under an attack on both political, personal and public relations fronts as the ministry of magic attempts to squash their belief in the return of Voldemort.<br /><br />  On top of this, our angry Harry feels overly protected by Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix and wishes to be allowed to do something, anything. Seeing his friends excel in various activities of school causes him both joy, and anguish, depending on his mercurial mood.<br /><br />  Eventually Harry begins teaching a select group of students Defense Against the Dark Arts and a wonderful new character, Luna Lovegood, joins the core group of friends. Luna was a great surprise, a placid, self-assured, calm free-spirit. She brings a nice calming balance to the core group of otherwise hyper individuals.<br /><br />  The first 100 pages in Sirius Black's house allow us to see Professor Lupin, Black himself and the real Mad Eye Moody who have all returned as well as a few other new characters on the side of Voldemort.<br /><br />  At the culmination of the book, not only has Harry grown, but the other core group and incredibly the Weasley twins fulfill their potential in a completely plausible and heroic way.<br /><br />  Despite the length, the pacing is pretty much perfect, I kept reading all night long until finished. There are a few dragging spots, mostly due to Harry's adolescent rages being overdone. Even with that though, the book is brilliant and far and above the others in the series, and should rank amongst the classics of the genre.ots, mostly due to Harry's adolescent rages being overdone.

Yoda does come off as a bit too saintly though, though obviously weary from age, from the approaching darkness and the loss of so many friends he continues to be compassionate, humorous and even optimistic as he tries to bring Dooku back. <br /> <br />  The two padawans are also well done, one who grows from annoying with a chip on her shoulder into a maturing padawan who accepts her place and her relative lack of force talent, the other a tortured, talented padawan who has seen a vision of his death. The interaction with each other,  Yoda, and their masters is very well done. <br /> <br />  The plot moves along well, with good pacing. We have some nice slow moments at the Jedi temple, some humorous moments as the Jedi have to take commercial transport, and appropriate action scenes.  <br /> <br /> Altogether highly recommended.

The first half of the book flows well and is actually quite interesting I thought. The pieces are put into place for a nice, albeit shallow, military sci-fi story. Unfortunately along the way things go wrong.      We start with a nice invasion by the Separatist forces leaving just a couple of survivors on Praesitlyn freed, along with the hostages at the communication center. Meanwhile Anakin and Halcyon bond together, although Halcyon gets too close to Anakin too quickly, and prepare the liberating forces. Anakin buckles down to learn how to command while an intriguing new character, Slayke, lands on Praesitlyn and neutralizes the Separatist forces. So the pieces are in play, the two survivors who know the planet and are developing a love affair, the rogue general Slayke and his forces holding the planet, and the two Jedi with the clone army arriving. On the other side we have an interesting drug addicted banker running the Separatist forces and Asajj Ventress apparently leading their reinforcements.      Then things fall apart. Upon landing and saving Slayke's troops, Slayke meets them and has turned into a complete insufferable prig. The infodumps that were actually interesting in the first half of the book multiply and become more tedious. We have some large scale fleet and ground actions which manage to be boring despite the numbers involved. These are not David Weber battles full of action and interest.      Finally Anakin realizes he has to do it himself, so he does. Hostages are rescued, we see a pointless death used for poor dramatic effect to push Anakin into a darkside moment, and Anakin flies off to join the fleet engagement. Ventress, who we were lead to believe was coming does not seem to be with the fleet. The Separatist fleet goes down easily and the worst fake death scene ever is perpetrated upon the reader(Anakin appears to the characters to die, we all know he isn't going to). The characters that showed promise upon introduction devolve into caricatures and what was an endearing romance between the survivors becomes annoying as they and a couple other soldiers stand around and bicker for a third of the book.      The 2.5 starts rounded to 3 for the beginning of the book. If only they had worked as hard on the second half this would have been a great one. Hard Contact still reigns as the best military clone wars book.	2004-12-30

For example we have a reference to the quote \\"I've fallen and I can't get up.\\", the USO tours with Bob Hope and plays his theme song \\"Thanks for the Memories.\\", the journalist orders a Pan Galactic Gargleblaster and at the end, the droid and the journalist walk off together a la Casablance stating more or less \\"I think this is the beginnning of a beautiful friendship.\\" <br /> <br />  Bad humor aside the book is a satisfying conclusion to the first one. The spy is telegraphed very early on to the reader thus increasing the tension as to when/if they will be caught, or if the wrong person will be accused. The droid I-5 and the journalist Den Dhur get some good development and Jos and Tolk's relationship travails are the most emotionally engaging part of the book. <br /> <br />  As with all the clone wars novels, plot developments make the entire reason for the fighting and loss of life pointless, continuing on with the overall theme of the pointlessness and horror of war throughout the novels. <br /> <br />  Were it not for the inappropriate humor, this would have been the equal of the first book. All in all it was a most satisfying duology. We get closure and haven't seen the story dragged out longer than necessary.	2004-12-28

The development is slightly lacking though as the authors seemed unable to quickly sketch the characters memorably before deepening their development. Still though it is quite a good book character wise and we see a great deal of emotional conflict.      As I mentioned, plotwise this is fairly weak, with some problems being easily taken care of by the hand of the authors removing characters. The triple agent spy is put on page several times to no real outcome, the actual battles and military objectives of the war on this planet are not mentioned at all, and the embezzling Hutt and admiral are conveniently pushed around by the authors to avoid problems with the main characters. On the other hand though, major characters die and change, their worldview is shaken by near cognizant droids and emotional clone troopers.      Overall this is recommended and a nice change of pace in the Star Wars universe.	2004-12-27

The biggest problem is that Barnes is taking pieces from various media and dropping them in without any backstory for those who haven't experienced the media the characters appeared in. I speak primarily of Asajj Ventress apparently from the Dark Horse comics, and the X'Ting apparently from a novella 'The Hive'.  <br /> <br />   When put together, these pieces fit disjointedly and really harm the continuity and flow of the book, making it difficult to get interest in continuing on, or in caring for the characters. <br /> <br />  As for the story, well it is both Shatterpoint Lite, and Hard Contact. Jedi go to a planet to solve a problem and find lies and deceit. Stover did this better in Shatterpoint. We see one clone trooper picked out to develop and after having read the absolutely superb Hard Contact, it seemed shallow and forced the way it was done here. <br /> <br />   The actual Cestus problem was really meaningless, and very little time given to it. Again, the book seemed a series of unrelated vignettes that Barnes wanted to explore but he just couldn't pull them into a cohesive work. Instead the read is left a little befuddled wondering what he read, and more importantly, why he read it.	2004-12-24

I feel that the shorter works are the strength of Baker and are better than the novels. <br /> <br />  The idea of immortal cyborgs hiding in the shadows of history to plunder artifacts recorded as lost or destroyed is clever and provides the opportunity to place stories in a myriad of periods and cultures as well as dealing with famous and not so famous historical characters. <br /> <br />  We not only get to see the two main characters, Joseph and Mendoza in these stories, but some more amusing operatives such as Kalugin and Lewin, providing more breadth on the operations of the company. In fact we get to see the early cyborgs, pre homo sapiens designed for enforcement rather than preservation or faciliation. A broad history of the company is painted in these short tales. <br /> <br />  All the stories are quite good, as enjoyable in this collection as they were on the first read. The one caveat is that all together they are a bit much particularly if read in one sitting. Other than that I think the Company tales are first rate storytelling and Kage Baker a wonderful author.	2004-12-14

We then get to the point and Zahn cranks the pace up to the frenetic level of the original movie. <br /> <br />  We get to see a dysfunctial survivor civilization, which is interesting enough. However we find out next to nothing about them. They hate Jedis, and feel that Jedis betrayed them, why? Why are a Jedi and a Chiss on the bridge of a dreadnought, if they were working together against the Vagaari why do the survivors, and the Chiss, feel that Thrawn destroyed them. Is Zahn just setting us up for another book? That isn't quite proper. <br /> <br />  The bright points are very well written action scenes where the Jedi go after the Vagaari and Luke gets to really shine. Also the electronics tech/Ambassador character was fairly well done and developed. In a nod to Heinlein's Double Star for a time he finds himself actually being a real ambassador despite being a fake. <br /> <br />   Work your way through the first third of the book quickly and you'll probably enjoy this one once you reach the meat of the story.	2004-12-12

I'll try to comment on both of them in their appropriate place. <br /> <br />  There are some problems with this book, I felt it was too long for one and the first 300 pages dragged. I'm reviewing it now and I got it in hardcover when first released. However the ending picks the pace up and manages to keep the reader enthralled. <br /> <br />   There are obviously no real surprises here. The ending has been telegraphed fairly well over the last 4 novels or maybe more. That being said although we know where the journey is taking us, Luceno, not one of my favorite authors, makes the journey a pleasant one. We get to see Luke absolutely kick butt, we see the annoying Solo children of the previous publisher's books come into their final fruition. Though I didn't like Jacen's temporary godhood it was the telegraphed culmination that he would be the new \\"balance of the Force\\". <br /> <br />   The ending was particularly well done, bittersweet farewells of tired damaged warriors in a tired damaged galaxy with some very nice human moments. <br /> <br />   What can we say about the NJO? I don't think it did all it set out to do, but it came pretty close. It was light years above the New Republic series of the previous publisher. The lows of the NJO came nowhere near the many many lows of the previous series. We saw main characters die, we saw characters change, we saw the philosophy of the Force through many viewpoints. We saw a high level of writing overall and some pretty good editing to contain the very large story arc. We got new stories in the Star Wars universe with an intriguing culture in the Vong. We got Nom Anor, the most despicable creature ever who went from being an absolutely loathed cardboard villain to someone the reader knew inside out. We saw many characters have very real crises of faith, hit rock bottom and come back in a fashion that didn't makeit seem predictable or cliche. <br /> <br />  Thus it is somewhat sad to see it end. It needed to end, don't get me wrong, it had gone on long enough and it was time. The Clone Wars novels are now the spiritual successors to the NJO, showing the greater depth and complexity of the shaded morality of the universe that we first saw here.	2004-11-23

It didn't qualify as science fiction then, and it doesn't now. It is a minor plot point anyways. <br /> <br />  What we really have here is a book of urban class warfare. The haves, have-nots, immigrants and natives, whites and coloreds mixing it up, not always aligned as you'd think, in a cauldron about to boil. <br /> <br />  Some parts are well done, and Brunner touches on some of the themes we'd see in Shockwave Rider, Stand on Zanzibar and Sheep Look Up. In fact our traffic analyst protagonist with his detached, no-roots lifestyle is similar to the assumed background of Shockwave Rider's Nick. The tension builds slowly, too slowly I'm afraid, leading to the eventual explosion and denouement. <br /> <br />  Though the conceit of having each character be a piece in a chess game is interesting, I found it forced the plot and took away from characterization. That along with the slow pace of the plot made this only an average read for me.	2004-11-16

In fact some of the background filling in of the world is more interesting than the plot. In particular the mutated dog and his relationship with normal dogs and human society. <br /> <br />  Prose aside, Zelazny manages to be at once all too clever and heavy handed. Calling the Dream Master \\"Render\\" and having his female patient be named \\"Eileen Shallot\\". Other references to classic myth abound as if Zelazny is telling the reader \\"Oh, aren't I/We so smart, catch the symbolism and foreshadowing here??\\" <br /> <br />  The plot is fairly simplistic, and the ending heavily foreshadowed. For all that it still managed to get me a little engaged even though it was obvious how it was going to happen. Unfortunately, virtually all the characters are unlikeable, from Render, to Shallot, to his girlfriend DeVille and in particular his son as well as Shallot's dog. <br /> <br />  Several interesting plot threads are developed and just left hanging. As this was an expansion of a short-story why not flesh out those plot threads. What's with Render's suicide obsession, and the suicides we see of people in the society? What's wrong with the mutated dog, why does he run off and torment normal dogs, is this normal or is the dog as broken as his Mistress? <br /> <br />   The quality of writing and the ideas though save this from being a poor novel and pull it into the firmly average bracket. Zelazny fans, or those into novels of dreaming such as Lathe of Heaven may wish to give this a look.	2004-11-08

One would think that the characters would run from location to location blowing things up like a computer game. Happily it is much more than that. <br /> <br />  Though there is a smattering of small squad military action, the strength of the book is the camaraderie of the clones and the growth of the Padawan who \\"leads\\" them. We get into the clones' heads and learn what makes them tick, and see them grow as they encounter things their training has not prepared them for. Through the Padawan we see discussion on the ethics of war, the ethics of creating the clones for the sole purpose of dieing for the Republic and the opinions of both the clones and the Padawan on the subject. <br /> <br />  This was a remarkably mature work, the good folks do some very bad things in pursuit of their goals but also show heroism and sacrifice befitting their status as heroes. A bittersweet ending tops it off with even more of a taste of reality.	2004-11-07

Sure, it wasn't great, it didn't even have pretensions of trying to be so. <br /> <br />  The characters are primarily straight out of central casting. The two major characters are likeable, but with no real surprises. The plot twist, if it is meant to be one, is telegraphed with all the subtlety of a 2x4 to the skull. <br /> <br />  However that is only minor as the story, like the Star Wars movies, is really a break-neck ride through one fun and dire situation after the other. In this aspect the book and author succeed at providing some easy to digest entertainment. <br /> <br />  Some of the iconic Star Wars movie characters appear, however they are a bit superfluous and could probably be done away with. There was a bit of an effort to have Leia inspire/change the protagonist, but the other appearances were of the \\"Hi, look it's me, Luke, Luke from Star Wars\\" variety. <br /> <br />  If you are looking for a quick, enjoyable light read this is recommended.	2004-11-04

Masterful prose which you'd expect of Nabokov who writes with a seemingly effortless lyricism to evoke the drab, stark life and surroundings of Luzhin and the development, or lack thereof, of Luzhin. Combined these create an effective, creepy tale of obsession and self-destruction when one views life as a zero-sum game. <br /> <br />  However, I read primarily for plot and there isn't so much here. The main plot is actually the setup for Luzhin's endgame. Once Luzhin has his incident in the middle of the book it is effectively over. Like a chess endgame, the outcome is known, as are the moves, they are just played out to the inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br />  One other interesting portion to the book was the study of alienation. Obviously Luzhin's alienation to the entire world, but also the alienation of Russian ex-pats to the western world as well as to their newly communist homeland and also Luzhin's wife has alienation issues with her parents which may have caused her to marry him.	2004-11-04

In fact about half of them are average, mildly entertaining stories. The problem is the other half are below average to flat out dire.<br /><br />  The arrangement of the stories left something to be desired as well. Placing the very worst story of the collection in the fourth slot, after a couple below average tales almost put an end to my reading right there. The story I'm speaking of is the Hilary Clinton in Valhalla tale.<br /><br />  Even the better stories are hobbled by the restrictions of the collection. One after the other of stories that are very similar, bad jokes that aren't presented too differently from one story to the other just wears the reader down with the lack of variety. Really, how many breastplate asides and jokes are necessary?<br /><br />  Suffice to say that the title is the cleverest part of the collection. Good idea, but it wasn't pulled off.<br /><br />  2.5 stars that I rounded down to a 2.	2004-10-04

In this collection we see vengeance taken from the point of view of the wronged, from the 'victim' of the vengeance and we see people pass over their chance at vengeance. <br /> <br />   There are some nice ideas in this collection, some good stories but I'm afraid most are solidly mediocre. Solid entertainment but not always passionate or inspired. <br /> <br />  All in all it is a nice day's entertainment giving a nice survey of the vengeance theme.	2004-09-25

The pacing of the book is even, but excruciatingly slow. The book is more similar to Legacy of Gird and Liar's Oath, than to Moon's other books. It feels as if a particularly uninspired author pounded this one out to meet a deadline.       The book starts quickly, but predictably, setting up the story. It then slows terribly and despite the trials, tribulations and dangers our protagonist suffers, it is difficult to be emotionally engaged.        The ending gets better though, showing Captain Ky getting on her own feet without family, or academy and shows promise for the next book. Without the ending this book was perilously close to being a 2 or 1 star book.	2004-09-23

He doesn't pull punches either with major and minor characters subject to terminal events. <br /> <br />  Though I vehemently disagree that this series is satire, there was some mild humor with the incompetent hereditary politician that Jak is assigned to make shine. <br /> <br />  However the strengths of the work are overshadowed by the bleak and cynical way Jak is used and abused by his teachers, his government and his \\"friends\\" as well as the way Jak is forced to use and abuse his friends as well. <br /> <br />  I give this one a 3.5 that I round up to 4.	2004-08-31

A couple years after Duke of Uranium frat boy archetype Jak Jinnaka is happily ensconced at the Public Service Academy causing trouble with his buddy Dujuv. Upon receiving a message from his ex-girlfriend he trots off to the rescue.      However, he quickly finds out that his ex-girlfriend princess wants nothing to do with him and is in fact a cold-hearted, manipulative murderess grasping for power while making a harem of her personal guard. By happenstance he enrages her by stopping an assassination attempt and is shipped out to Mercury to be kept out of her clutches.      In Mercury, Jak involves himself in helping the down-trodden miners who are being placed under the thumb of a crimelord who is quickly monopolizing the entire planets mining industry. In order to do this he is forced to make a very hard choice with an \\"ally\\" that may destroy his friendships.       We have really two different stories in this book. Both of them provide good background on the universe. The Aerie section of the book is the best, where Jak's innocence is peeled away layer by layer by the cold machinations of his ex-girlfriend. Jak's more noble actions on Mercury, including the hard choices he has to make just aren't written quite as well.      In the end Jak's growth is summed up nicely by his ex-girlfriend who lets him know nothing much has changed on Mercury despite his efforts, and his teacher who lets him know that he is just the kind of heartless person they need for the service. The universe pushes Jak around a lot here, he survives it but is greatly changed, a lot wiser, a lot more knowledgeable, and a lot less happy.      On the whole pretty good.	2004-08-22

You're hooked from the start with this one and you'll read it all the way through. Though light on characterization his mastery of plot and pacing drive the story forward relentlessly. <br /> <br />   Particularly good are his visualisations of the powers of the elite in the chess world, demonstrating this by having young Beth play games at night on her ceiling by memory and their prodigious memory for the games and positions of chess theory.  <br /> <br />   The character of Beth is sympathetically self-destructive, the supporting characters aren't really developed. Just as Beth is mono-maniacal about chess, the book is mono-maniacal about Beth. This is her story and her story alone. This is not a weakness, but perhaps there was another way the book could have gone with more of the supporting cast. Beth is likeable, and fallible enough to have the reader emotionally invested in her success. <br /> <br />   Highly recommended for anyone, knowing a bit about chess, the tournament scene, and the state of the game in the 60's will add to your appreciation of Tevis' craft but is not necessary to fully enjoy this story.	2004-08-17

He is slightly likeable, but the foreward to the book makes it clear he is not the nicest guy in the galaxy. We see as he graduates from school he is self-absorbed and shallow, and apparently quite manipulative. <br /> <br />   That being said, Barnes has created a nice universe, with slang as good as Burgess' in Clockwork Orange. True it can be a bit difficult to decipher but it does add a nice flavor to his creation. <br /> <br />   Jak's friends are likeable enough, and they are, like Jak and his associates and enemies shaded with grey. Faults and virtues peppered throughout their character making them interesting though not really 3-dimensional. <br /> <br />   There are really 3 parts to the book, our introduction to Jak and the world and the setup for Jak's mission. This is reasonably well done. Not necessarily easy to penetrate but well done. The second, and best part, is the leisurely space voyage to get Jak to his mission. Jak's worldview is challenged by the opinions of crewmembers on the ship he takes from his home to Earth. A sweet romance with a crewmember as well as Jak's joining with the crew and bonding shows Jak at his most sympathetic and likeable. The last and weakest part is the frenzied mission where things fall together very easily, for a reason it turns out. The best part of Jak's adventure is his being thrown together with an alien his culture has taught him to hate and his realization that what he knows isn't necessarily so. <br /> <br />   Though not great, and a little slow-paced, this is a nice modern mature juvenile science fiction work also readable by adults.	2004-08-17
US	51985525	R1VNRRG2EF2KLF	1857443314	428678482	Play Winning Chess	Books	4	158	161	N	N	Good, but steep learning curve	This book aims to take the reader from beginner, possibly not knowing how the pieces move, to a player able to think and develop their game without getting wiped off the board quickly.<br />  We start with the obligatory rules of the game. Yasser doesn't waste time, they are taught quickly and then boom, you are thrown into chess playing.<br />  After learning the rules of the game, we are introduced to two basic checkmates, King + Queen vs. King, and King + Rook vs. King. No King + Bishop + Bishop vs. King, or the dreaded King + Bishop + Knight vs. King but that's ok as they are of greater difficulty. A beginner will do well to just learn the methods for these two mates.<br />  All well and good, but nothing any other beginners book hasn't done before. Yasser now throttles up the pace and exposes the reader to 4 ideas, at least one of which isn't typically exposed to beginners. Force(material inequality), Time(piece development), Space(control of the board) and Pawn Structure. These will be tough to move onto for someone who has just picked up the pieces in my opinion but they are the next necessary steps.<br />  Finally we have a collection of several short games where Yasser annotates the typical beginner mistakes that were made and why they are losing. This is probably the best part of the book and it does a good job of tieing together the four chapters on the concepts he taught. A glossary of chess terms, many not used in the book is also included.<br />  As a foundation, this would be a good book for someone who really knows very little or nothing at all, but despite Yasser's easy style it moves fast and will require work from the reader.	2004-07-11

Unfortunately the mix doesn't quite work out as well as you'd hope.<br />  The main portion of the book is the trip the author takes to Russia, and then Kalmykia to investigate Kalmykian president/dictator and FIDE president/dictator Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. As in Heart of Darkness, things get more and more chaotic as they grow closer to their goal with the chess master falling apart from the stresses of being in an unfamiliar environment. The squalor of both Russia, and more so Kalmykia is well described and heart-breaking.<br />   Really though nothing much comes of the trip despite the author's somewhat Don Quixotish quest to find something about a murdered Kalmykian journalist. The total surreality of Chess City just overwhelms everything else.<br />   The interludes the author provides on the history and development of the game of chess are particularly well done.<br />   The other portion of the book, modern chess in the USA is more about Hallman's relationship with both Glenn the chess master, and chess itself. Hallman becomes infatuated with chess, just as becoming infatuated with a girl but never really gets to know chess first-hand. Like admiring the girl from afar he gets his chess impressions through the characters found in the chess world particularly his friend Glenn.  <br />   Realizing he will never win the attentions of his new infatuation he becomes ambivalent, even hostile to both chess and Glenn, his attitude swings back and forth as he ponders the useful, or uselessness of chess while seeing what it has done to some people. This was quite interesting, his internalized love/hate relationship with both the game of chess and the chess world is familiar to many chess players.<br />   The chess world is full of great characters and stories, and I think the book would have been stronger if he had followed Glenn throughout a few more tournaments rather than devoting so much to a fruitless quest ending in a very brief, but very scary, interview with Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.<br />   The prose is quite readable, though at times a bit over the top. Hallman is even-handed, though not altogether sympathetic to his friend Glenn, and the world of chess and chess players.<br />   On the whole, this work is very interesting, but very flawed. Like a chess game it was as interesting for what might have happened as for what was put down on paper. It is worth a look for the personal interrelationships on the dysfunctional Kalmykia road trip and the sequences about chess history as well as the US tournament scenes. Similar to Searching for Bobby Fischer the book is strongest when in the midst of the tension of a tournament and shows weakness when going overseas.	2004-07-03

As I mentioned, they can be somewhat cynical, sometimes whimsical,and always satirical.<br />  Tenn's afterwords to each story provide some interesting insights, and in a couple cases give good reason anyone would display some cynicism<br />   Overall it was good enough that I shall be trying to get the second volume. The good stories repaid the effort put into reading them and more than made up for the stories I personally did not like.	2004-05-29

This may be the best collection of stories ever published, science fiction or not. Even anthologies that pluck the classic short stories of an entire decade would have trouble matching the works collected here.<br />  Cyril is cynical, at least he appears so, but he was also brilliant and entertaining. There is not a weak story in the collection and many are superb. The work is so good it is difficult to be dispassionately critical rather than gush with praise.<br />   We see many of the tropes of science fiction, common then and now used by Kornbluth, however they will appear new and brilliant even to the most well-read and jaded reader.<br />  The book may not make you feel good about humanity, but it will make you feel good about buying and reading it. It is one of the most entertaining, well written collections of short fiction I have come across and I am a big fan of short fiction.<br />  NESFA has done a huge service by collecting and publishing this volume, as well as other collections.<br />  Also pick up &quot;Not this August&quot; by Kornbluth, as well as &quot;The Space Merchants&quot; by Pohl and Kornbluth.	2004-05-28

For a supposed classic of the genre I was very disappointed.<br />  There are some good points, the ideas and the society created are very interesting. Unfortunately though it seems that in order to get more out of the book you will need to read his complete short fiction The Rediscovery of Man. Though this book should stand alone, it really doesn't and characters pop in and out without the reader ever learning who they are, why they do things and where they came from.<br />   Apart from the interesting glimpses of the universe and the society imagined in the work the book did not work for me. The plot is muddled and disjointed. I'm not really sure there is a plot actually. I understand it is actually 2 shorts put together in novel form. The prose which is praised by so many others I found to be pedestrian.<br />   For light on plot, new-wave science fiction that shows glimpses of a well envisioned society I'll stick with John Brunner.<br />  Hopefully reading his short fiction will make this story more complete.	2004-05-26

He is undeniably a brilliant author and great storyteller. However, this early work displays all of Stephenson's faults in full bloom while merely hinting at his strengths.<br />  As always, Stephenson writes a bang-up beginning. Those are always his strengths, he then is typically weak with endings and holding the plot together. Unfortunately in his first novel here the threads of the plot escape his reins quickly and run out of control.  There are some funny bits in this alleged satire, such as the M.A. and philosophy Ph.D. cement-truck drivers. However the satire quickly escalates into sheer lunacy, and becomes so ludicrous that it loses effect.<br />   One other problem is the jarring change from 3rd person to 1st person that occurs from time to time in the book. The narrator of the book is a participant, albeit a very passive and seldom seen participant. The change of perspective from straight 3rd person to a sentence beginning with &quot;I&quot; really takes the reader out of the story.<br />   Add to these problems the apparent Boston University in-jokes and the good things in this novel are vastly overshadowed. There may be a good Stephenson story in here, but it needed much tighter editing.<br />   Luckily for us all, Stephenson got much much better. If you must see his genesis as a writer, read this, if you aren't interested in his development as a writer give it a big pass.	2004-03-18

I was thrilled when I heard I would get a new novel 15 years after his death. Unfortunately, there is very little of a story in this book.<br />   When Heinlein is actually telling a story here, it is worthwhile. The story though, where Heinlein correctly follows the advice of &quot;show, don't tell&quot;, consists of short passages between very long lectures and exposition on the philosophy and mechanics of America in 2086.<br />   Through some of these lectures, Heinlein's authorial voice is strong and entertaining in the mode of Jubal Harshaw/Kettle Belly Baldwin/Professor. Just as many though are long-winded and tedious, particularly the one explaining the Social Credit economic system.<br />   The seeds of his later works are sown here, and fairly obvious to pick out. This however would be no consolation to the average reader not familiar with Heinlein.<br />   Sadly, I can recommend this only to Heinlein completists interested in his very first work. It is good for us all that he improved so much.	2004-03-14

It is science fiction only due to its age and the idea of a device monitoring psychiatric/psychological functions.<br />   Our protagonist, a psych agent in the military is put aboard a sub to see what is wrong with the captain, and there is possibly a traitor on board. The pressure the title refers to is both the pressure of the deep deep water, and the pressure of being cooped up in a sub with other people doing an incredibly stressful job. We see the coping mechanisms of the submariners as they are under stress.<br />   Unfortunately I couldn't really care about the main character, and I found the sub hunts were not paced well to create any real tension. The ending though is a lot better and finally some excitement and real tension is created, enough to redeem the book but not enough to make it the classic it is revered as.<br />  Points for the idea of a techno-thriller but due to a generally uninteresting story this is only an average work.	2004-03-11

This work is an example of the past which has changed.<br />   This book has thematic similarities to both his Galaxia/Gaia of the end of Foundation, as well as with Clarke's City and the Stars and Childhood's End. In that it deals with the grand transfiguration of human culture from the safe and staid to uncertain limitless potential. Oddly though, Asimov's position in this early work is diametric from the result in Foundation and Earth. <br />   This dichotomy also appears in the work, it is almost like two books in one. A straightforward, simplistic 'Back to the Future' naive work that was common for the time dealing with simple characters exploring the neat idea of time travel and its paradoxes. Then for the very last few pages we switch gears to a philosophical discussion on man's place in the universe and his destiny.<br />   For me, the straightforward adventure story of fixing the timestream worked better than the philosophy of fixing the future so mankind will not be safe, but be adventurous and leading to his Galactic Empire/Foundation series. Particularly as I have mentioned Foundation comes right back full circle to a planned safe society rather than an uncertain dynamic society.<br />   Perhaps this was done intentionally as in this book we are told that the centuries are cyclic with industries and attitudes returning over and over again. It could be Asimov's arcing storyline over this and his other series was hinting that not only did industries and social mores repeat, but that a slower cycle of uncertain expansion alternated with the safe over-controlling method of Eternity in this novel and Gaia/Galaxia at the end of Foundation.<br />   To try and summarize, the adventure story here will go down easy and please you while the ending will give you things to think about and possibly disturb you.	2004-02-24

A short, entertaining, straightforward city adventure with few surprises is surprisingly engrossing. While the plot is simplistic, it manages to be better than average at emotionally engaging the reader as the author(Athans in this case) does not shy away from making hard choices.<br />  A few problems prevented a 4 star rating. The Duke, who knows Regdar well, and was betrayed last book by Regdar makes Regdar the Lord Constable and tasks him with investigating crimes. Regdar previously has been as dumb as a rock, solving all his problems by running straight into them and fighting. He would not ever be named to such a post. Naull makes some inexplicable choices, and casts some spells that we have never seen her use, or mention. The love interest plot between Naull and the Duke's daughter is slightly developed, then the Duke's daughter is swept offstage until the epilogue. The villain was only ok, he got some decent exposition, and motivation for his crimes but he really needed more development.<br />  The ending though, after the final battle was quite satisfying. It is probably not what a reader would want, but it is the logical result of the happenings in the plot. <br />  The series is over, and it ends on a relatively high note here. As more books were bad than good, this is a good place to end it.	2004-01-26

Regdar commits treason by leaving the duke's service, and compounds it by taking the four best fighters with him under false pretenses.<br />   They proceed to hew their way through wave after wave of cannon fodder, showing that Regdar is still as dumb as he was when fighting goblins in book one The Savage Caves. This approach of a head on attack against insurmontable odds succeeds in most improbable fashion with our heroes killing everything that moves no matter how powerful despite having no plan, no subterfuge and no skills other than hitting things really hard and fast.<br />  There are heroes who can take on insurmountable odds and win, without making the reader roll his eyes in disbelief. This book does not do this. Regdar is so stubborn and limited in his uses I was hoping for the blackguards troops to take him out.<br />  Despite some bright moments early on, and the redeeming Plague of Ice, this franchise of rotating authors has turned into novel after novel of slapdash plots, conflicting character portrayals and backgrounds and uninspired prose. Star Wars quotes are not funny in a dungeon crawl though apparently the authors don't understand this as they appear in more than one book. Perhaps it was a running gag that they each try to hide one Star Wars series quote in each book. It wasn't funny guys, it was stupid and it jerks the reader right out of their willing sense of disbelief.	2004-01-20

Repetition, repetition and more repetition to ground you in mating themes.<br />  I myself do 10 a day, and they are so helpful that I was able to recognize the seeds of a mating position in a tournament against a player rated 200+ points higher than me and prosecute a moderate length(4 move) forced checkmate after only 13 days of exercises. <br />  Keep in mind, this is not an instruction book, it does not give advice, nor rules, nor methods to checkmate. It consists of diagrams and there solutions for different checkmate motifs. Consistent, steady and repeated study of these problems will result in your automatic recognition of both attacking chances, and your own danger.	2004-01-19

There are unfortunately more instances of bad grammar, as well as a quote from The Empire Strikes Back that take this from an average dungeon crawl to less than average.      We have three returning characters, Devis the half-elf Bard, Vadania the druid and Lidda the halfing rogue. Vadania and Lidda are uncharacteristically besotted with Devis though they are both experienced enough to know better, particularly Vadania. Tordek a dwarven fighter is the new iconic addition and Vadania is given a wolverine companion.       That being said, the actual adventure is fairly good. Some really powerful enemies and enchanted weapons with a satisfying ending. It is really too bad that this series suffers from an editor who shows such disregard to the readers by allowing such continuity and basic english mistakes.	2004-01-12

There are some continuity problems with Hennet but nothing as egregious as previous continuity errors have been so I'm much more forgiving. The one-shot ice druidess was nicely developed, continuing with the tradition of the iconic characters being supporting casts almost to the better developed guest stars.<br />  There is nothing special about the plot, but it is well crafted and does a great job of projecting the cold to the reader. The dungeon crawl late in the book was actually entertaining and had some surprises. For once Regdar and Lidda didn't run in like complete buffoons, Lidda actually did some scouting.<br />  A bittersweet triumph, a return home and a nice night's reading is complete. This is the best iconic D&amp;D book since Oath of Nerull, also featuring Hennet.	2004-01-09

The way the characters are handled in the plot is. The editor of these books should be ashamed at the abysmal job he's done. There is no similarity between the three returning characters and their prior appearances.<br />  In this tale we have Lidda the halfling thief return, she is changed for the better and has lost her mouth and her modern hip-hop slang from The Savage Caves. Krusk the half-orc barbarian returns in his 3rd, yes his third, incarnation. In City of Fire he was a good, loyal, team-player. In The Bloody Eye he changed as his IQ jumped, he got well spoken and even seemed to be able to read, directly contradicting his iconic statistics as well as becoming a leader. In this book there is no goodness left to Krusk, he seems to have a new backstory, no mention of his time in the forces of the Protector of the Obsidian Throne, his infatuated tavern wench Yddith from The Bloody Eye is mysteriously gone and not mentioned. He is now a cold-blooded killer, no doubts about it and probably well in the evil alignment. Mialee the elven wizard has lost her familiar, her bad eyesight and her bard lover. The new character, Vadania the druid, may as well not be there she is so superfluous.<br />  Malthooz, the half-orc outsider from Krusk's home village(until Krusk changes again next story) was the most interesting of the lot, though his potential of becoming a cleric of Pelor is not pursued.<br />  The triple-cross plot of the book, Thieve's Guild playing off our &quot;heroes&quot; against their wizard customer and the city watch is ok, but the execution is very poor. The collateral damage the characters cause without a twinge of regret is abominable. These  incarnations of the adventurers cannot be considered &quot;good&quot; in any sense of the word. Innocent warehouse workers employed as a front are slaughtered by Krusk and Lidda, Mialee fireballs a dock to kill her pursuers resulting in a conflagration that is goingto kill many and cost more their livelihood. They look back and say &quot;We did what we had to do.&quot;<br />  For the editor of the 10 books to allow such different portrayals of the characters, not to mention backgrounds, shows a complete and utter disdain for the discernment of the reader. Shameful and unforgiveable.	2004-01-05

The writing is at times cringe inducing in its triteness, particularly the paragraph where Yddith swoons over Krusk.<br />  In this book we have one new character as a hero, Yddith the tavern wench with a lot of moxy and an amazing talent for sorcery despite no real training. Jozan the cleric from the Savage Caves returns, and is relatively unchanged. Alhandra returns from the previous book and has changed from a compassionate, caring leader into a self-righteous black/white/no shades of grey prig of a paladin. She then whiplashes back and forth between being a prig and compassionate. Her back-story is \\"developed\\" with the lousy cliched tale of being wronged by her love. Krusk, the half-orc barbarian, returns from the previous book also. He now has been given a big i.q. upgrade and substantial leadership abilities.<br />  Calmet, the main point of view character for the forces of badness is Jozan's old teacher and provides the most depth of the book as he wonders why his god Pelor abandoned him. Still though it is paper thin religious philosophy he thinks of and only deep in comparison to the awful portrayal that this \\"T.H. Lain\\" gives to the heroes.<br />  The Black Carnival, a travelling show populated by the undead is also a high point, a neat idea that isn't given much play.<br />  The dungeon crawl is average, but the horrible changes to the characters as well as Yddith's amazing magic abilities make this at best a 2 out of 5 stars.<br />  A shame, the series was looking to develop quite well just 2 books ago.	2004-01-03

I suspect it was written by the same &quot;T.H. Lain&quot;.<br />   Regdar and Naull, the fighter and wizard from The Savage Caves return. They are joined by Krusk, an half-orc barbarian and Alhandra, a snow-white paladin of Hieroneous. Regdar and Naull again display a lack of sense in exploring, twice running into dungeons without planning. Once due to the plot, but during their introduction in this tale due to stupidity. They have learned nothing since The Savage Caves, and despite the second book their characters have not developed either.<br />  Krusk and Alhandra don't get developed either. In fact, as in The Savage Caves, the cannon fodder enemies get better exposition and development. I really actually felt for the gnolls and their doglike pack bonding.<br />  This gets 3 stars instead of the 2 the Savage Caves received only because the ending allows a continuation with a villain who can return to further torment our heroes.<br />   After the last two much better works, this one is a grave disappointment.	2003-12-28

Particularly in comparison to the two predecessors, the poor The Savage Caves, and the average Living Dead.<br />  In this tale, a monk, a sorceror, a gnomish wizard and dwarven cleric deal with Nerull, the god of death, and his cults attempt to destroy the monkish order the protagonist Ember belongs to. Nerull's influence apparently carrying over from the Living Dead, shades of Bhaal and the Forgotten Realms.<br />  This short book packs a lot into it, a fledgling romance between Ember and the sorceror, humor from the wizard-sorceror arguments of the two magic-users, a rather decent magic duel contest, and a quick dungeon crawl to root out the source of the cult's resurgence.<br />  Somewhat predictable, yes, the characters though are developed well enough for a short work and the ending is appropriate but slightly surprising.<br />  A nice night's light entertainment here, the series has improved with each volume to become solidly entertaining light reading.	2003-12-24

In this piece we have a new cast of characters, more seasoned adventurers than in The Savage Caves and the story is of a 1000 year epic struggle involving higher powers rathern than the cave crawl of the previous book.<br />  The pace is slower and the characters are allowed to give much more exposition, probably too much exposition with many speeches giving the history of everyone. However it does allow the characters to become much more fleshed out than the ones from The Savage Caves.<br />   The actual adventure consists of a bard, mage, cleric and ranger trying to finally end the terror of a very powerful undead. It was actually solidly mediocre and uninspired, just what you'd expect from franchise fiction.<br />  All in all, an improvement over the very poor The Savage Caves yet only a mediocre 3 out of 5.	2003-12-21

The poor prose, lack of a cohesive plot and reliance on gory fights bear his thumbprints.<br />  Essentially we have 4 neophytes trying to save a village from spiders. The spiders being disturbed by a hobgoblin who wishes to be king of the goblin tribes. The adventurers in this short novel obviously don't get fleshed out, which is ok since this is just supposed to be an entertaining dungeon crawl.<br />   The party is quickly seperated and the novel begins to show severe weaknesses. The author moves back and forth from character to character too quickly in buzz-flash MTV type video edits for someone with absolutely no attention span. I am speaking of repeatedly moving from character to character after just a page or less quite often. The characters roam around the dungeons like beheaded chickens and of course prevail. Rather than being a short and sweet fun dungeon romp we have a short, but confused and stupid dungeon romp.<br />   A very weak start to this series. The good points, what few there are, would be the ambigous morality of the goblins being neither good nor bad, just cowardly and selfish, the four primary characters, though unfleshed are pleasent enough excepting the halfling with her modern slang and foul mouth.<br />  If you want something quick, and unchallenging you might want to give this a look, but there is better fluff reading out there.	2003-12-17

The extra pages are filled with King's strength, characterization.<br />  Roland and company fight their battle on three fronts, in near modern day New York City to protect a vacant lot holding the rose which is a Dark Tower analog, in the Calla against child-stealing bandits and in the mind of Susannah who has to again fight against another personality.<br />  Father Callahan from Salem's Lot gets a large portion of the story, and though his journey doesn't really move the plot along, it is enjoyable just for what it is, the fall, struggle and attempt at redemption of a troubled man.<br />   As I mentioned above, the length of the book allows King to fully characterize not only the gunslingers, but also the secondary Callahan, as well as a number of the townsfolk in the Calla. As far as plot progression goes, the overall story arc is not moved very far forward. This is the sort of adventure you would imagine Roland having in every troubled town he comes to.<br />  However despite the slow pace of the book and the fact the plot did not progress well it kept me quite interested because the story he told, basically an aside to the overarching quest, was a good one. King is a storyteller and he does it well, whether he tells an epic, or detours to tell the story of a minor character's trip through alcoholism.<br />  This is definitely recommended for those who've kept on with the series as it is an improvement over Wastelands and Wizard and Glass in my opinion. Hopefully the next one will be as great as The Drawing of the Three. The ending of this one does bode well for a more fastpaced resolution as the problem left hanging needs immediate resolution.	2003-11-20

The problem is that unlike his son Josh in his previous work Searching for Bobby Fischer, there is no emotional hook here to make you really care about Kasparov, or the chess championship. Which although it isn't altogether a bad thing, it does preven the reader from becoming terribly interested in the book and renders it into a sterile work of biographical scholarship.<br />  The book primarily focuses on the Kasparov-Karpov fifth match in New York/Lyon in the early 90's. Kasparov at times ebullient, petulant and despairing finds himself caught between business concerns, chess concerns and political concerns. Kasparov's chameleon like emotions are the primary reason both Fred, and the reader cannot get close to him.<br />   As with Searching..., the digressions are the weakest point of the book. Though necessary due to Kasparov's involvement and angst about them, the political reports take away from the main narrative.<br />   One backhanded compliment, reading this book does give you a sense of the exhaustion felt by top level players in world championship level chess.<br />  Kasparov's auto-biography, Unlimited Challenge, though self-serving was a much more interesting read. However, I do give credit again to Waitzking for making this an honest, fair look at his friend Kasparov. I'd really like to know if Kasparov looked over the book and what he thought about his portrayal.	2003-11-09

The movie distilled what the book was about, Josh and his father, and excised the two weak sections.<br />  The parts of this book that deal with Fred and his feelings about his son's chess genius are very well done. Waitzkin writes in a congenial, easy to read fashion that communicates the story well. He neither presents himself as a saint, nor a sinner.<br />  The weak parts are the two digressions. The first is the trip to the now defunct Soviet Union with Bruce and Josh to watch the ill-fated first Karpov-Kasparov match. Though the politics of the old Russian chess scene can be of interest, they are jarring in this book of a father and his son.<br />  The second weak section is Fred's trip to California to try to find Fischer. Of course he doesn't so we are treated to 2nd and 3rd or worse stories of Fischer's descent into his own world. Again, Fischer's life is interesting in a cautionary trainwreck way but is not really properly part of Fred and Josh's story.<br />  Though this is not a chess book per se, an appendix with some of Josh's games would have been a nice thing to have. However, I'm not subtracting from my rating for that, just a suggestion.<br />  The story of Josh and Fred and their journey through competitive childhood sport, chess here could be replaced by anything, is wonderful. The sidetrips however should have been edited.	2003-11-01

As the series was stopped here, it went out on a low point.<br />  The biggest problem by far is that Diana is a secondary character in her own book. Of 300 pages I doubt she got 100 of them. Even when she is &quot;on-screen&quot; she's overshadowed by the high school students. The true main characters are the high school students, spoiled, self-centred, shallow and mean-spirited high school students. Even the ones who are made out to be the good kids eventually show their darker side, and do so after the evil has been vanquished.<br />  As well, possibly due to her lack of being the main character Diana does not seem to be the same as she was previously. This new catch phrase &quot;Jesus Cluny Frog&quot;, where the heck did that come from? As well she no longer seemed to be the caring Guardian she was before. She also lacks even the limited forensic skills she showed in previous books. She was never an ace investigator, but at least she tried in the other two books. Here she decides the villain must be an adult, and can't find one so she shields a couple students and then waits for the villain to reveal herself. Somebody with a special investigator card from the police, and a friend in Det. Mark Valdez  should have better skills than the reactive wait for the villain to reveal herself while she causes more harm.<br />  It was nice to see Mark Valdez again. Unfortunately he does nothing. He chauffeurs Diana and then waits in a barn. Literally. As well, the sub-plot of the goddess under Tulsa goes out with a whimper, never really happens.<br />  The villainess is easily the best thing about the book. An aged sorceress in a young body, gorgeous, evil, ruthless and totally without a redeeming characteristic. Yet, she is unable to manipulate the high school students unless they themselves have given her a hook by doing wrong themselves.<br />   Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad book. It is firmly average, worthy of an evening or two's entertainment. However, it is not a Diana Tregarde book as we know it as she is at best a secondary character. The writing is, as with the previous two, fast-paced and easy to read.<br />  R.I.P. Diana, it is a shame your last book had you as a secondary character.	2003-10-26

Along with the travails and dangers Diana has to face we learn about her past and we get to see a wonderful tale of redemption as well.<br />  Based on a short story that appeared in the Werehunter collection Diana must contend with a rock band transformed into psi-vampires and a soul-destroyer. To complicate matters, Davey, one of the band is her ex-boyfriend who hurt her badly. A \\"normal\\" vampire also gets in the mix as her love-interest.<br />  The most interesting parts of the book are the dual tales of redemption. Diana coming to terms with her past and conquering her fear and Davey's fight against what he has been turned into.<br />  Pacing and tension are also improved over Burning Water, in this book you actually believe harm can and will come to Diana and people involved with her. Like Burning Water, it is also a fast read.<br />  I will again state it is a shame that Lackey stopped writing Diana Tregarde books. Diana is a nice character in a nicely realized urban fantasy world.	2003-10-15

Diana Tregarde is a great character, and so is Mark Valdez. Both are fleshed out well in various vignettes unrelated to the investigation of the crime.       The problems I mentioned are problems of competency. Nobody seems to realize that pulling a heart from a body, in the southwest, could possibly be related to well known Aztec ceremonies where that happened. I studied that ceremony in grade 6. Ok, Diana was kept off the trail by spellcraft, but surely somebody else would have figured it out. The villains as well are not overly competent, luckily for Diana and Mark. When told to send a warning to Diana by taking down someone close to her, a minor character she saw once before and didn't like was taken down. As if the author didn't even want a peripheral friend of Diana's to be hurt.      Those problems aside, the plot flows well and it keeps your interest despite the fact that as the reader you know who is doing what. Mark and Diana are both wonderfully sympathetic, attractive characters and the fact that they have to struggle to figure this out is a small plus. The shadowy world of psychics, mediums, wiccans and pagans is also shown well, and the supporting cast is reasonably well defined, though somewhat cliched.       Diana had great potential, I look forward to the next two books and it is a shame she quit writing them.	2003-10-14

However, Keyes writes this so well they do not detract from the enjoyment. He has deconstructed the NJO down to a bare bones Star Wars story focusing on just a few characters. Of all the Star Wars novels I have read, this one is possibly the closest to capturing the feel of the original movies. In fact it reminded me in spirt of The Empire Strikes Back, high praise indeed.<br />  There are really two problems in this novel. The first is the Bilbringi space battle. It is totally extraneous to what the book is about and seems included only because a space battle is thought to be obligatory and to give some face time to the Solos. The other problem is that the uneasy truce of Corran Horn, Tahiri and Nim Yen, Nom Anor and the Vong priest is not uneasy enough. In fact after just a tiny bit of tension they all get along well excepting Nom Anor. After the billions of deaths, it is just a bit too much to expect them to work together this well, especially when they don't really have their backs to the wall.<br />  That complaint aside, the quest of Corran and company and their own discovery of Zonoma Sekot races along and is quite enjoyable. This is the first book in a long time I've read straight through in an afternoon/evening. Keyes reveals intriguing hints of the end of the series, allows Nom Anor to once more throw a wrench into the works and leaves us a cliffhanger, bittersweet ending.	2003-10-13

The pacing and tension of this book are handled much more effectively. Thus the highs and lows of the story are felt more fully by the reader.<br />  Weber does not disappoint in his battles. Though I do not yet think they are approaching Honor Harrington levels of greatness, we have some massive battles with big, incredibly destructive weapons. Fleet actions on the order of 2 million to 48 in a lopsided hopeless defense. Technology though, as in Harrington, proves to be more important than numbers.<br />  The idea of the Achuultani horde and their masterminds isn't too bad, yet we only get to see one alien in anything more than a &quot;Hmmmm, there is my enemy, I shall attack them, Oh no, now I shall die.&quot; presence. More could have been presented from the Achuultani side to make this book better. As it is, they manage to be one step above mindless ravening locust swarms to the reader, but perhaps not known well enough to the reader to have the reader care whether they get wiped out by humanity.<br />  The characters left behind to guard Earth while Colin goes searching for help get the best exposition. Their depression and exhaustion are felt as they suffer wave upon wave of attacks hanging on by their fingernails waiting for Colin's return.<br />  All in all a well done book with just a few things that could have been improved. Weber fans will know what they are getting here and enjoy the fast pace and the space battles.	2003-10-08

There are some good ideas in it however Weber is still learning his craft here and the presentation comes off as immature. Not immature attitude wise, but he has not yet mastered his craft.<br />  The idea of long-lived aliens fighting a war on earth while their descendants, humanity, are unaware of it is intriguing enough. The enhanced soldier idea is old, but Weber handles it well enough so it doesn't appear terribly old and re-used. His battles as always are superb.<br />  However, there are somethings that are too predictable. Such as the fiery young woman who initially takes a dislike to our hero. We all know what will happen in that relationship. Cleverly though, he has her speak in Shakespearian English, the tongue she grew up in. Which is a nice touch giving us a reinforced reminder of her age and avoiding having all the long-lived ones come off as being able to easily master the language and societal changes that happen around them, particularly as many of them are sequestered.<br />   The plot is not perfectly smooth, it stutters and stops and starts which is a shame because a bit more polished presentation would have made this a much better book.<br />  Though I have been a bit negative up above, it is actually fairly decent. The battles of course are superb. The intrigue of the power-seeking villains looking out for themselves against one another is done well and though still an early effort he makes sure to have enough of his characters flesh out to be more than one dimensional. Perhaps not three dimensional, but not cardboard cutouts.<br />  As a story it is interesting enough. It is also a nice view into the early talent of one of the top selling authors of today.	2003-10-03

Unlike most of the first collection, these stories mostly feel like they could take place in the Star Wars universe and are viable adventures that the heroes could have had before The Empire Strikes Back.<br />   Still though, they are not stellar work by any means, merely solid. In retrospect, due to the authors not knowing where George Lucas was going, some of the things you see cause some cognitive dissonance. No fault of the authors, but it is still jarring to see things you know are untrue.<br />   Decent artwork, and stories in a rather large collection make this a worthwhile collection if you'd like to read a sort of slightly altered universe of what the Star Wars characters did between the movies.	2003-09-19
US	51985525	R17MBSTQV5YCH4	0756401216	639470615	Magical Beginnings	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Less than Magical	Wondrous Beginnings, the science fiction companion volume was much better.<br />  The best thing about this book would be the introductions by each author telling a bit about themselves and the story and how it came to be.<br />  The stories, as one would expect from first published stories, are not of the world-changing variety. Perhaps the best is Peter Beagle's story, and that one isn't fantasy at all, nor science fiction.<br />   The stories aren't bad mind you, some of them are reasonably good. The majority though are middle of the road pieces that are somewhat predictable showing the authors before they developed their voices.<br />   This review may be coloured by the fact I had just finished both Wondrous Beginnings, and Assassin Fantastic. Both DAW anthologies also. This caused me to notice the line-up of the authors was virtually the same in this collection as in Assassin Fantastic. Thus, not really a great overview of the field, but a showcase for the current DAW workhorses(excepting a few). It would have been nice if they could have licensed short stories from authors currently under contract to other publishers for their novels. The collection would have been stronger had they gone farther afield rather than just showing off their own authors.<br />  This was a good idea, but the roster of authors wasn't representative of the stars of the field in my opinion. Of course that does mean you may be exposed to new authors, which is always a good thing. Unfortunately, too many collections of the same authors has caused me a familiarity that has bred not yet contempt, but a bit of apathy.	2003-09-18

That is why it is so disappointing to see his work in this compilation. It is incredulous that the man who produced the gorgeous, crisp, clean art of American Flagg was responsible for the sloppy, hurried art presented in his issues. After Carmine Infantino takes over though, the art improves markedly. <br />   The first six issues are an adaptation of the movie, although it bears much more resemblance to the novelization as it includes such things as Luke seeing his friends on Tatooine, Luke being a part of Blue group rather than Red. The first cover features a red-headed Princess Leia and a green Darth Vader in a mistake of galactic proportions. Also editing errors are rife throughout the adaptation with weapons being called different names throughout and not often matching what they were called in the movie. I can only hope they rushed these out 1 a week the quality was so low.<br />   After we get through the movie adaptation things improve, though for a while we get some really bad editing. Names spelled differently in different panels for one thing. Still though, despite the improvement in plotting there are still some laughably bad ideas such as Don-Wan Kihotay(also spelled Don-Wan Kioti) the Man of La Mancha Jedi ripoff.<br />   There is continual improvement though and we eventually get to see some nice, plausible adventures of what may have happened to our heroes after the destruction of the Death Star. Chewbacca though never really looks much like Chewbacca.<br />  Two stars for the beginning, and the continual improvement brings it up to three stars.	2003-09-09
US	51985525	R1AP6DM1ZXE2SD	0756400023	882477161	Assassin Fantastic	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Slight Overkill	I love assassins. Using their wits, stealth, skill and the judicious use of force to complete their mission they appeal to someone who wants more than a mighty thewed warrior hewing his way to success.<br />   That being said, there's one thing assassins do. They kill, or at least try to. A book full of assassin stories, no matter how varied the collection tries to make the stories, does get a bit tiresome if they are are not all superlative.<br />  In this case, the middle stories are particularly weak. Halfway through the book I was composing a three star review. However, the beginning and end containg strong stories.<br />  Particulary strong are the Tanya Huff story, the Edgehill, Lindskold and West. One of the joys of short story collections is the introduction to new authors. In this case I will definitely be picking up the Huff, Lindskold and West novels featuring these characters and/or locales.	2003-09-07
US	51985525	R2Y2XA7UAHDMT2	0756400988	125366105	Wondrous Beginnings	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Good Start	This is a particularly strong collection. Particularly when they are self-limiting to the first commercial published work of an author. After all, how many people write something really great the first time.<br />  However the majority of these stories are quite good, the worst story would be merely lightweight but fun. Spanning almost 80 years of SF it also gives a very wide view of the field. From the early, joyously simplistic stories that were driven by the nifty idea to the more character driven stories of today.<br />  Most of the authors are familiar names to everyone interested in the field, however there were some new names to me, and some I had heard of but not read. I'm sure that you'll find a new name in either the older or newer authors represented to discover.<br />   Other than the superlative Ender's Game the stories are reasonably short, making them well suited to brief periods when you have a little time to read.<br />   The quality of the stories, the breadth of history displayed and the wide range of authors make this a fine collection. One of the best I've read recently.	2003-08-28

I really didn't like the collection though I wanted to. I believe the problem is that the success of this book has made it seem nowhere near dangerous 35 years later. They pushed the envelope, now everbody goes there and their works seem commonplace.<br />  On the plus side we get some early works from Zelazny and Delany, Harlan's acerbic, biting introductions cannot hide the love he actually feels for his other writers.<br />  There are some quite good stories in here, typically these stories are where the author didn't feel the need to try to be &quot;edgy&quot;, or &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;relevant&quot; and let the pushing of the mores come from the story, not the other way around.<br />  The stories where it seems the authors wanted to be &quot;dangerous&quot; don't come across well now. They are either irrelevant, naive and some even seem to come across as little children playing potty-mouth in the absence of their parents. When the stories are bad, they are very, very bad.<br />   Good works do abound in this collection, thus the three stars. However some are so bad you'll wonder if it's worth continuing. The last stories are generally stronger. The stories that begin the collection are the duller and poorer ones.<br />   I am disappointed I did not find this to be revolutionary, and it does not live up to its hype, nor legend. It is a look at a certain time in the field, a time when the style of writing changed, or tried to change with some good stories and some bad ones. That's all it is now I'm sorry to say.	2003-08-13
US	51985525	R2XG7H352AX3LG	0441005667	204362253	Forever Peace	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Forever Flawed	This book contains a great novella, about an individual dealing with his military service as a remote soldier-boy, operating a military robot miles away from a protected base. Unfortunately, Haldeman jumps the story in it's tracks twice. <br />  We first jump the tracks when our hero leaves the soldier-boy life behind and his academic pursuits which were just a side-plot become the whole plot. It appears there may be a world destroying experiment about to run. <br />  We again jump the tracks and the world destroying experiment goes back to being a secondary plot point in favor of a ludicrous idea to \\"humanize\\" the world by linking everyone together to prevent them from being able to kill, or even be aggressive. In some ways this is like Stand on Zanzibar by Brunner, but it is more sinister, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but the Body Snatchers are the heroes. Haldeman here returns to the idea of Hive-Mind, or Communal Society that he presented as being bad in Forever War and Forever Free, here though it appears that brief patches of being part of a group mind essentially neuter a species violent impulses.<br />  Putting my issues about the ridiculousness of the plot, and it's philosphy aside the book still fails after leaving the soldier boy plot on other levels. Other reviewers have mentioned it goes from being a good war story, to a spy story. As a spy story it is third rate, not fleshed out properly and filled with bumbling characters.<br />   I was a huge fan of the Forever War, now after this book and Forever Free, I fear I may be Forever Finished with Haldeman.<br />  Three stars for this book, because the first third was quite good.	2003-08-02

Unfortunately, the last third is horrible.<br />   Mace Windu travels to a jungle planet to investigate a missing apprentice. As he travels further and further into the jungle planet the rules of society disappear and things get more and more chaotic just as in Heart of Darkness. Windu, used to a clean society of black and white laws is similar to Inspector Javert of Les Miserables. He needs black and white laws and when every action causes untold catastrophic consequences with nothing clearly good or evil he has trouble coping. This riff on Heart of Darkness is nothing short of brilliant. We see the jungle dwelling force users who have succumbed fully to the chaos of the jungle's force and Mace's slow descent.<br />   However, as if a switch were flicked off, Mace puts it all behind him, buckles down and starts fighting endlessly. The last third of the book is a very long, ugly, improbable battle that finds the shatterpoint of the reader's willing sense of disbelief. Characters who have a light-saber through the gut, are cleaved through the chest and hands to within an inch of the heart, and cleaved through the torso all miraculously survive after the utter destruction of a city when the nearest rescue arrives 48 hours in the distance.<br />  I give this 3.5 stars, rounded to a 4. A perfect first two-thirds that take Star Wars to a new level which makes the contrast of the obligatory battle scene even worse in comparison. Mr. Stover, you went from Heart of Darkness and called in the Apocalypse Now airstrike with Jedi. Unfortunately, it didn't work out in the end but the effort and the beginning were brilliant. Next time if you tie it all together you'll have a true masterpiece. Until then, this is despite the awful ending well worth reading for the masterful beginning.	2003-08-01
US	51985525	R1SU3U6C3L35Y6	0441010156	690410292	Red Thunder	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Improbable, uplifting fun	Despite the physics of the propulsion system, which may as well be called magic this is close to being the perfect, modern Heinlein juvenile science fiction work. All that prevents it from being a true juvenile is Varley's apparent inability to write a book without gratuitous sex, and kinky sex at that.<br />  A fine cast of characters, both the \\"adults\\" and the \\"kids\\" are given enough depth to be realistic and they all have their problems, personal and financial. Almost all of them are delightfully quirky and pretty likeable.<br />  The plot is a bit slow until the climax, the book perhaps a bit too long, or perhaps too short as the climax is quick. However, from liftoff in a Florida bay to Mars to the epilog is pure magic and presents a future of easy interstellar expoloration and colonization we can hope to have one day.<br />   The ending is particularly well done in avoiding any cop outs. Some characters do very well, some less well, familial conflicts from the past do not always get resolved despite their success. The resolutions or lack of for each character will be pleasing to most readers though.<br />   Finishing this book you'll feel good, about the book, about yourself, about the characters and about humanity and our future. It was good enough to lift even my spirits and I'm a pretty downbeat guy.	2003-07-23

The story starts sharply and moves, keeping the pages turning as we follow the brothers in their perfect crime. However just as the perfect crime goes sour for them, so does the plot.<br />  Once we get into the meat of the book, too many characters cause problems and the extra characters are predictable stock characters right out of central casting. We have a mixed ending. I give credit to the author for not making a happy ending, but it is also a bit maudlin and jarring in comparison to the rest of the book.<br />  The positives are that it can be read quickly, it is fast-paced and readable and the beginning is dynamite. Soon though you'll get tired of the morass of the chase with the very bad evil secret service agents and the feisty private eye you know is going to side with the brothers. At this point only the fact it is very easy to read will keep you going as frankly the book goes on too long and the secret they find really doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.<br />   This was my first Meltzer book, I am unsure if I will pick up another.	2003-07-18

The end has been well telegraphed, it is only a question of the mechanics.<br />  Just as this trilogy ends, no mystery, no danger, no surprises in this book. It isn't a bad book, but I think the first two were better. The Tahiri solution was obviously coming and well foreshadowed so I'm sure everyone knew it. Zonoma Sekot turned out to be rather, well, dull and Han &amp; Leia win another space battle. I love space battles, I loved the X-Wing series, here though the battles are becoming routine. Like the war torn galaxy and the decimated Vong the series is running out of steam.<br />  The mechanics of the book are fairly well done, the various threads, The Zonoma Sekot search, Nom Anor's heresy, Tahiri's struggle and the Empire/New Republic alliance battling together are woven together well. Perhaps a bit too much jumping between threads at the start but all together fairly well done. Not much character development takes place other than Tahiri, everyone seems to have matured into their final forms as we round the last turn and head into the final straight-away.<br />  If you're a Star Wars fan, pick it up, it isn't bad, it's just &quot;Another New Jedi Order Book&quot; ANJOB.	2003-07-12

This collection though contains some pure entertainment stories but mostly challenging works on a variety of subject matter.<br />  Thus it required a lot more effort to read than I expected. However, the effort is more than worthwhile. They are all good stories, some very good and many of them will give you something to think about long after you've finished the collection.	2003-07-04

However this is much superior in that things actually happen and there is a major event at the end of the book.<br />  Vlad, Aliera, Morrolan, Sethra Lavode, the Goddess Verra, and Lady Teldra spend much of the book either in a cell, or at castle Black talking amongst themselves on how to escape, and after escaping, how to defeat the Jenoin who have battled the Dragaerans for ages and are making a major offensive to gain a link to the raw power of sorcery.<br />  I fully expect the next Vlad adventure to be Vlad having a meal and talking for the whole book about his food. Despite all the talking though, it is a superior entry in the series. Much new is revealed and we get to see a major battle at the end as well as some further characterization of all the major players.<br />  Vlad's journey is becoming a long one, and a slower paced one than at the start. It is still a worthwhile journey though.	2003-06-29

Both interesting in that the plot is of interest and the awkward style which doesn't quite work but is also interesting nonetheless.<br />  After Orca, we go back in time to Vlad's time in the Dragon army. Vlad originally starts out being the wisecracking crimelord that he was in the beginnning of the series, yet upon volunteering for the armed conflict he seems to be much more like the weary Vlad of Athyra/Orca reviewing his life. It seems Brust's personal growth means you can never go back home again, even if you're a fictional character. Which is all for the best, I didn't like the return to the early shallow wise-cracking Vlad after reading Athyra. I was pleased when the character started displaying a more mature view later in the book.<br />  Making matters more complex is the fact that Brust seamlessly weaves three timelines in the book from Vlad's point of view and you are moved from one to the other without warning. We are presented with 1) The Build-up 2) The final confrontation and 3) A post confrontation encounter and we jump from one to the other as Vlad dictates his experiences to a recording device.<br />  This struck me as trying to be too clever and artistic and wasn't pulled off well enough. I think Brust's reach didn't meet his goals here.<br />  For the plot, we have a comfortable army story, nothing too special but well told. Those who enjoy such tales will enjoy this one.	2003-06-21

In brief<BR>Athyra-4 stars, a nice book from an innocent's viewpoint about Vlad.<BR>Orca-2 stars, a dull book about financial swindles.<br />In full:<BR>Athyra-I have not enjoyed a Vlad book as much as this once since the first three. Switching the narrative away from Vlad was a refreshing, and necessary move to invigorate the story.<br />Savn, an innocent Dragaeran youth is a wonderfully sympathetic character studying to be a physicker when Vlad arrives at his town. He befriends Vlad and begins to find himself ostracized from his friends for hanging around the Easterner. Once he helps Vlad with his injuries there is no turning back.<br />Through Savn's eyes we get to see a vulnerable Vlad, a hurting Vlad without the cockiness, one who is rethinking virtually everything about his life, life in general and the universe. We see Savn grow through meeting the challenges of befriending Vlad, his sister also and we see Vlad changed and changing from the flippant assassin.<br />The pace is relaxed, without being slow, and builds to a climactic ending with consequences for everyone. A very well done effort from Brust, it was almost like reading about Vlad for the first time due to the change of viewpoint. <br />Orca-In this plodding tale of Vlad, much talking is done about a banking financial swindle happening. Like Vlad investigates Enron, but not that much fun. In order to help Savn, who saved Vlad previously Vlad must help out an old lady with the power to possibly heal Savn. This leads to the investigation of the financial swindle.<br />Vlad and Kiera play Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew, except again, it really isn't that fun. The book is dialog heavy and as exciting as my accounting textbook, maybe less so.<br />As others have said, the revelation in the last 10 pages is the only payoff for reading the book. Not worth it in my opinion.	2003-06-13

Leia learns of her family past, unwillingly at first, through meeting the friends of young Anakin, and then through a video diary created by Anakin's mother. She comes to some terms with her father's past and her future by doing so, becoming fond of her grandmother through the video diary.<br />  Denning does his usual workmanlike job, no real flair, no real disappointments. Her beginnings of an acceptance of her heritage though causes some minor continuity problems in my opinion. Such as her reaction in the Thrawn trilogy to being Lady Vader, and the whole White Current being her destiny as laid out in the Black Fleet Crisis.<br />  All in all, a laid back adventure that serves the purpose of a decent book about Leia. Solid, slightly above average Star Wars fiction.	2003-06-13

In Childhood's End a great transfiguration into another level of existence and in this one the waking up of two moribund earth societies in the far future.<br />  Slow and ponderously we move through the book, exploring the earth and the universe. We find the universe empty, almost completely devoid of the galactic empire that permeates the legends of earth society. Though there is a point, and it is realized at the end of the book spending 212 pages exploring empty vistas is not my idea of entertainment.<br />  At the end, mankind has awoken and again given an opportunity to grow and become more than the fearful earthbound race it had turned into. We end with much work to do and the idea that it is the journey that is worthwhile, not the destination.<br />  This golden age classic sadly is showing it's age. The ideas now co-opted and familiar to everyone and the plodding plot barely able to hold a reader's interest. The final payoff just barely makes it a worthwhile read, and there is some historical significance of this early example of the conceit of examining deep philosphical issues.	2003-06-02

Nick himself is a hard character to warm up to, the future is not a pretty one and bad things happen to good people more often than not. However the previous 4 books were worthwhile reads. Not easy reads all the time, but worth the effort.<br />   This book though as my title proclaims is the weakest, and bleakest of the series. The next book Patriarch of Hope is much better and redeems this one. In this book Nick is removed from his strengths and is landbound as the elected leader of Earth, off and on. He is responsible for his own child as well as a child of a friend.<br />   We get to become all too familiar with the down and dirty slums, and down and dirty politics of the world and Nick's dysfunctional family. All the characters come across as unsympathetic and not likeable. Very little hope, very little redeeming about the plot. Drawn out, depressing and it is really hard to believe you've cared about Nick before, and harder to believe you'll care about his child in the next book.<br />   You could probably skip this one and not miss a beat by heading to Patriarch's Hope. If you must complete the series, be forewarned, this is hard work to get through and there isn't much payoff.	2003-05-30

Though the conclusion is telegraphed 3/4's through the book if not earlier it still was not disappointing.<br />  This is the most plot driven, character intensive of the three books. Exploration and discovery of Gaea are minimal and thus the wonderment of the previous books is lessened.<br />  The plot is developed naturally from what we knew before, the Hollywood obsessed ancient goddess is losing more of her faculties and needs to be dealt with. A plan is hatched and carried out.<br />  As with Wizard, the beginning sees the introduction of a new character who becomes a major companion of Cirocco as well as the reappearance of some of the original crew for the conclusion of the book.<br />  Like all the best endings, it is merely an ending, not the ending with many questions created and possibilities revealed for the future of Gaea, and the characters.	2003-05-27

Supplicants in need of something from Gaea such as a disease cured are allowed to come to Gaea and she amuses herself by making them perform &quot;heroic&quot; feats to get the boon they wish.<br />  We are introduced to two characters from Earth, a youngish girl from a space colony of lesbians suffering from a type of epilipsy, and a fellow with what seems to be multiple personality disorder. After reaching Gaea they join up with Cirroco and Gaby and the story really takes off.<br />  All of the sense of wonder of exploration from Titan is still evidenced here, and is even more imaginative. However the characters struggling with their issues as well as the environment is what drives the story and makes you care what happens. Cirroco has become a functional alchoholic, Gaby remains the most normal but bears the scars of loving Cirroco.<br />   Visiting the regional brains of Gaea allows the two visitors from Earth to develop their character while showing us more of the wonders of Gaea. Eventually we learn the visit is to sound out the possibility of a rebellion and the dramatic tension heightens.<br />  Though the book provides full closure to the story, there is a definite hook to Demon which will make you want to move right on.<br />  This is a fast-paced, fun read that is more than worth your while. I cannot believe I have waited this long to experience this bravura performance.	2003-05-24

Unfortunately, neither approach the heights of that trilogy. The first, Surrender None is slow going but is worth the effort. Barely! The second, Liar's Oath, is a book that had no reason to be written. There is very little story, a confusion of who the main point of view characters are on the authors part with none getting much on page time yet not working as an ensemble piece either. In the end very little happens, and what does happen is so buried under the mundanity of most of the work that it seems trivial.<br />  Moon is a good author. She stumbled badly here though. Unless you have the disease of being a completionist, give these a pass.	2003-01-25

Here it really works out well. I'll risk heresy and state that I think Lackey had been getting stale and a book of fresh viewpoints into her mythos is a great thing that can only help future works. There are tales here that are absolutely Valdemaran yet probably could never have been written by Ms. Lackey herself. This only strengthens her world considerably.<br />  To me, every tale here rang true to what Valdemar is about with nothing throwing me out of the story by being obviously wrong. Quality varies of course, but I don't think any story would be worse than mediocre, and most are above average and some first rate tales. <br />   The short story is quite well suited to providing a look at the other corners of Valdemar that aren't royal family, or top herald related and these do so superbly. These new voices may have even inspired the better quality Exile's Honor which was just published.<br />   If you enjoy short stories, if you enjoy Valdemar, pick these up. Allow yourself to believe that other people can write in this universe as well as the creator and you'll be in for a pleasant treat. Ms. Lackey deserves kudos for allowing others into her world, and doing such a fine job of picking good stories that fit into her world yet reveal more.	2002-11-03

The routine of life training recruits makes a reader comfortable and at ease as they immediately know what to expect. From this point we can either have an entirely by the numbers book, or move beyond this into something more.<br />   Neither really happens here, it is Valdemar after all so there is some by the numbers rote plotting but Alberich's assimilation into Valdemar while remaining Karsite in his heart is well done. Through Alberich, we actually see some things about Valdemar proven that we were only told. There is a community of Karsite ex-patriates, they worship the Sun Lord in Valdemar and are accepted showing the diversity and religious freedom of Valdemar.<br />   However, I would have liked this much better if a bit more of Alberich's time in the Karsite forces had been revealed. We have really only a brief sketch of his time there before he is Chosen and ends up in Valdemar. A bit more of the Karsite back-story would have been appreciated.<br />   The book is a fast read, and will keep you engaged. As I said in the title, this is familiar ground trod well. Good comfort reading with enough deviation from what is expected to be entertaining. I don't often comment on editing, but the book was fairly tight, a nice story given only the length it needed which is very nice to see in the current age of the bloated novel, bloated trilogy and bloated open ended series.	2002-11-03
US	51985525	R1H9NY6TWFDZMO	0743211375	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Pedestrian	Let's use the old cliche here, &quot;I'm a big fan but...&quot;. I'd give this a 2.5 were half stars allowed.<br />  In this reasonably short(for King) novel we see how a Pennsylvania police department reacts to the appearance of an interstellar/interdimensional transporter in the guise of a slightly off Buick. The tale is told to the son of the trooper most involved with the Buick by the long time troopers and employees of the station round robin style.<br />   As others have mentioned, nothing much really happens. Which can be fine because King's strength has always been characterisation. Unfortunately that is completely lacking here. We have some sketches of the characters but even at the end of the book not much reason to care for any of them nor do we know them all that well.<br />   The climax takes a long time to get to, and is rather short. However it is effective, tense, and saves the book from having been a complete waste of time. Were it not for the nice climax that did keep me turning pages this would have been a 2 or 1 star book.<br />  What went wrong? I think what we have here is a book that is neither younger King which would have had much more happen with the car, nor mature King in which the characterisations of the troopers would take precedence over creatures popping out of the car. Instead we have nothing really happening with the car, and despite all the jawing, nothing really in the way of characterisation. <br />  A younger King would have terrified us with an onslaught of creatures from the car, a mature King would have made us feel for the state troopers as they dealt with something so far out of the realm of their understanding. Unfortunately, we get neither. So consider this My Dinner with Andre and a Car. Guys sit around talking but nothing much happens.	2002-10-09

In 20+ years of reading fantasy I've never seen something with so many problems be so well received.<br />   The protagonists I found very lacking and unlikeable. The kender should have been fed to the nearest red dragon right off and the series would have improved. Tanis has the personality and depth of mashed potatoes and the only character of any substance, the admired Raistlin is merely a whiny adolescent boy. Sturm should have been called Stern, his obvious alliterative inspiration as he never gets beyond being the Stern knight. The dwarf is a caricature.<BR> <BR>   Strangely enough, the text of the book seems to be designed merely to flesh out happenings between game modules that may or may not be available to play. The second book of the series has the heroes just leaving what sounded like an interesting dungeon adventure. Unfortunately to experience that I guess you have to buy the module and play it. I find it very poor taste to have an epic fantasy series designed to drive the sale of game modules. The work should stand on it's own, and this one does not.<br />    The actual story is nothing new in any respect and with unlikeable characters reading it is a chore. We are given no reason to care about the fate of Krynn, or any of the characters. The world is presented with a veneer of depth, however there is nothing beneath the veneer. Interesting and varied names for many different factions may at first glance appear to give the illusion of complexity, but you quickly realize there is nothing really there beyond the illusion. In fact I ended up rooting against the buffoons portrayed as heroes. To rub salt into the wounds, the end of the trilogy is basically a deus ex machina of the poorest sort. I've read it twice, because it is so popular, trying to see if I am missing something. I came to the conclusion I'm not, or reading it originally at 25 I was too old for it and the literature I had read before had ruined this for me.<br />   I know my reviewer rating will get slammed for this, but it is my honest opinion that this series is complete and utterly mediocre. Without a TSR/WOTC gameworld it would have been unpublishable.<br />    There is actually some readable franchise fiction, so I'm not slamming it due to the source. I like Elaine Cunningham and Rob Salvatore, both workhorses in the TSR/WOTC stable. This trilogy is just rent paying hackwork though.	2002-05-07
US	51985525	R1TMUB7DXHAEJQ	0786926902	161290361	The Cleric Quintet Collector's Edition [Forgotten Realms]	Books	3	28	35	N	N	A really mixed bag	I came to this collection rather eagerly after having read Salvatore's Icewind Dale Trilogy, Dark Elf Trilogy and Legacy of the Drow quartet. I did not find it met the heights of the latter two collections and was on par with the earlier Icewind Dale trilogy. The Cleric Quintet is not a bad collection, it is just firmly average.<br />   The fact that we have the 5 books collected together is a plus for me at least in a monetary sense. Cadderly is a likeable enough character and is given a decent amount of depth in his religious doubts and the fact he does some possibly objectionable things to further his deity's agenda. The supporting cast both good and evil are alright, and Ghost in particular I liked.<br />   On the downside the portrayal of the supporting cast is not so great, and the plots don't have the vibrancy I expected. Salvatore's introduction states he wanted to write a book about monks and was told he couldn't as monks were not part of AD&D 2nd edition rules. He did put in Danica as a supporting cast member monk though and seemed to possibly care more for her than for Cadderly. The plots aren't too bad, some neat things but they seem to move slightly woodenly from point to point. Not poorly, but in the fashion of a car that needs servicing. You are taken to the destination but arrive with the feeling that the ride should have been superior to what it was.<br />   I personally feel that a major opportunity was overlooked with the portrayal of the bouldershoulder brothers as straight comic relief. The dwarf wanting to be a druid was a marvelous opportunity for character development. Here we have someone who is forbidden from taking up the druidic calling because of race but believes so strongly in it that he restricts himself to druidic weapons. This is really something that could have been presented as total faith and sacrifice and when he does get some druidic powers more should have been made of it. I think Pikel Bouldershoulder was the true icon of faith in the novels, not Cadderly and it is a shame he was presented as somewhat dim-witted.<br />   I don't feel many people familiar with Salvatore's work will be disappointed with this, and it does give a nice look at the clerical part of the Forgotten Realms which is not shown anywhere else to my limited knowledge. However those purchasing this won't find it to be as great as some of Salvatore's other works.	2002-03-15
US	51985525	R1LMNN3XGGKNOT	0786915250	561340873	Baldur's Gate: A Novelization	Books	1	44	49	N	N	Fails on every level	I will tell you up front, I went in knowing the book was bad so had low expectations. Those expectations were not met. I would not, could not believe how bad it was. The book fails as both a novelization of the computer game, and as a story.<br />   First, I didn't expect the book to be all that close to my own adventures in the game. Obviously the game is too big. However the author kills the NPCs twice. First with character assasination, the characters in the book do not resemble the characters in the games one bit. Secondly literally killing them, it is almost a revolving door. Join the hero's party, die, next NPC please.<br />   As a story it is truly, truly awful. Even given the level of gaming franchise fiction this is a low water mark. The most well developed character Abdel is barely two-dimensional if that. We see virtually no struggle with his legacy. It is magically overcome by the love of a woman. The plot is a mess as Abdel runs from location to location without reason. The background is almost totally left out. Our heroes run off to places because one line of explanation is given that there might be something in the next location. <BR>  <BR>   At 250 pages this is not that short a novel. Some exposition could have been given rather than run from one fight to the next. Now Eddings in his Belgariad/Mallorean takes a lot of heat for the plot essentially being location to location to location. The way Edding's does it though appears masterful compared to Athans. After 250 pages what we have learned about most of the characters is they are dead, Jaheira lacks morals and Abdel is boring.<br />   Even Robert Howard's Conan stories have more depth to them and they are pure hack and slash.<br />   What we have here is a very poor novel which takes place in a world where the places have the same names as that in Baldur's Gate, and the characters do but nothing else is even the same.<br />   Please ladies and gentlemen, even if you enjoyed this book as light-reading throwaway literature it is not a 5 star book. It is a 3 star book for those who enjoyed it, a one star book for those who didn't.	2002-02-26

One warning, those with rightish-leaning politics will probably no like the ending.<br />  That said this book is timeless and works on every level. Wonderfully written in a stylistic sense. A great story as well, and as usual for Brunner just a masterful job of world building. As far as I am concerned Brunner needn't have created his plots in this book as well as Zanzibar and Sheep. The sheer joy of seeing the worlds he makes is enough for a 5 star review.<br />  Above and beyond that however a quarter century later the book still displays relevancy in speaking both of technology and societal change. Both have been discussed by other reviewers. I will just add that this is one of the books that will stay with you your whole life, and upon each re-reading at every stage of your life it will give more to you.	2001-11-12
US	51985525	RY5XV9JDFLJUB	0345347862	145668397	The Sheep Look Up	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Wish I owned this, Brunner is a visionary	I was able to read this because the University I work at has it in the library. I was tempted to keep it and pay the U for the book and the fines so I could place it on my bookshelf between Stand on Zanzibar and Shockwave Rider.     One could consider this, along with Zanzibar and Rider as a trilogy of destruction. With Zanzibar being destruction from over-population, Rider being Destructiong because of ever accelerating societal change and this work destruction from pollution. Unlike the other two books though, this one does not have a happy ending.     Others have mentioned that there is little of a plot here. True, Brunner's greatness lies in the worlds he creates and how he presents them to you. You won't really care much about the plot you will be so intrigued at getting glimpses of the inner-workings of the society in a world on the brink of ecological disaster. This is Brunner's genius.     We are probably better off ecologically than when Brunner wrote this as he was inspired when driving though an area he saw posted warning signs that a river was a fire hazard. However this book still serves as a very real warning because it would be very easy to throw the hard-gotten improvements of the past 30 years away to satisfy our penchant for convenience and ease. Myself included.     With this work and the other two Brunner though writing \\"fiction\\" shows himself to be easily the equal of and likely the better of Alvin Toffler and others writing non-fiction about future societal change. He is eminently readable, knows the craft of writing and story-telling and is a master builder of worlds.     Should this book become available I will be snatching it from the bookshelves without a though.    *UPDATE: Found it in a used bookstore hurrah!!*	2001-11-12
US	51985525	RPC1BPLU8BRL0	0671319779	369408226	Ashes of Victory (Honor Harrington Series, Book 9)	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Veggies after candy-beware, spoilers	Having read and loved the other books like oh so many of you, I found this to be overly long, and a chore to read, like eating a heaping plate of broccoli after the tasty addictive candy of the first 8 books. This could have been two books done properly, or one book with the dross cut out. With three arenas to take care of, Manticore, Grayson, and the PRH it seems that the author has decided to quickly simplify the plot threads using a pair of shears. Snip snip, all PRH major characters are gone. Snip snip, goodbye Mr. Prime Minister, this war has gone on too long, Snip snip, there goes the fleet of the PRH. Amazing that Grayson was mostly untouched.<br />  Then the unforgiveable happens, shades of the Wing Commander series, the overused device of the defeated evil side suing for a false peace and the power-hungry &quot;liberal&quot; government falling for it and leashing in the heroic military. It is all too realistic, but after 600+ plodding pages it was all too depressing and unnecessary.<br />  What is left, an exposition of the somewhat more capable and enlightened PRH getting back on it's feet led by a government put together by Theisman while he and the capable admirals neutralize the Manties new tech advances, or Honor and Grayson taking the rest of the allies and carrying the fight whilst telling Manticore's new government to stuff it?<br />   Interesting parallels between this and Moon's Change of Command, both series are very similar, and both stumbled with similar books. Large complex stories can be done well, but it seems here that they don't have the ability to pace and present it appropriately.<br />   To be honest, after the many battles, political intrigues, assasination attempts and just sheer brutality she's suffered it probably would have been best to have won the war and ended the series. Maybe the next chapter will surprise me, but I'm afraid it will be another wearying experience.	2001-06-11

What do you do?<br />   Apparently you write 3 books so bad that the reader will be screaming for Boba Fett to come drop them into the Sarlacc rather than have to plod through this tripe. After finishing this, I still don't know what the whole trilogy was about. None of the characters made enough of a mark to remember their names and associate them with any almost non-existent consistent behavior patterns they displayed.<br />   I do not exaggerate when I say I felt confused to the point of feeling drunk reading these books. It isn't that the plots are intricate, I don't believe they are, it is that the author goes to such lengths to disguise there is no plot that the book plods and you forget what is happening and go back 4 pages to re-read the same 4 pages of non-happenings and remain mystified.    If you want to read about the bounty hunters, stick to the very well done Tales of the Bounty Hunters and skip this. Honestly there is better web fan-fiction about the bounty hunters than there is in this book.	2000-11-14
