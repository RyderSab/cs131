I long to have my own buisness, either in the rehabilitation field, or a related field.   <br /> <br />I purchased this book hoping to have a better understanding of the issues facing a company that provides non-emergency transport services (ambulette) for the elderly and disabled.  One of the problems I see is that available transport services are driven by coverage, not need.  There are people who need specialized transport, but are not sick enough to qualify for it.  The result: patients and families have to spend $100-$300 for what is essentially a cab ride.   <br /> <br />I had hoped this book would go into greater detail regarding types of vehicles, marketing strategies for private pay patients, etc.  What I received was the following: <br /> <br />1. Generic info on writing a business plan <br />2. Generic info on the importance of financial statements <br />3. Generic info on advertising and marketing. <br />4. Generic info on laws, zoning, taxes, etc. <br /> <br />I didn't find a single thing in the book that I hadn't already considered on my own, or read in another business book. <br /> <br />The author doesn't discuss the specifics of the wheelchair transport sector until the last thrid of the book.  Again, anyone with even a modest understanding of the healthcare system would know what is already in this booklet. <br /> <br />It is the only book in 8+ years I've purchased from Amazon, that I plan on returning.	2005-10-03

In actuality, there is nothing more here than a basic (and I do mean basic), primer on Exchange Traded Funds, and basic options trading strategies (covered calls and short puts).<br /><br />The first few chapters involve wasted pages on Modern Portfolio theory, the advantage of index funds over mutual funds, and the benefits of ETF's over traditional index funds.  Anyone who is knowledgable enough to be interested in hedge fund strategies (ie. statistical arbitrage, relative value, market neutral, etc.) will find nothing here that he or she doesn't already know.<br /><br />The second half on trading options on ETF's is similarly light on any interesting information.  Much basic information on covered calls and short puts is covered.  It wouldn't be unfair to call it simplistic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author did not discuss the important concept of implied volatility when discussing writing strategies on ETF's.  This makes certain option strategies, that normally are equivalent, less than equal when used on an ETF.<br /><br />The book correctly states short puts are equivalent to covered calls, when the puts are secured by cash.  If you are going to buy 500 shares and write 5 calls, it is simpler to just sell 5 puts, and hold cash to back them up.<br /><br />But the author neglects to mention that options on indexes often trade at what is called an IV skew.  Out of the money calls on ETF's are generally underpriced, while the puts are overpriced.  This makes short puts backed by cash superior to covered calls on an ETF.  But Lord help you if the market gets caught in a huge sell off, or implied volatility increases.<br /><br />There was no discussion of identifying when it is prudent to sell options and when it is wise to remain unhedged.  It didn't address the various follow ups to covered call/short put strategies when the stock moves adversely.<br /><br />If you know absolutely nothing about ETF's, and options trading strategies, then you might find this useful.  If you are looking for information on hedge fund techniques, look elsewhere.reases.<br /><br />There was no discussion of identifying when it is prudent to sell options and when it is wise to remain unhedged.

I have training in both Shaolin Kung Fu, with some limitted experience in Judo and free style ju jitsu.  I am also an occupational therapist, who is no stranger to anatomy, physiology, or the workings of the human body. <br /> <br />I've been interested in submission wrestling and grappling as a Chinese martial artist long before grappling was popular.  Perhaps this is why I'm not all that impressed with the book. <br /> <br />I have a vast collection of books on martial arts, especially grappling.  This book was one I decided to pass up, despite the fact I find YMAA publications to typically be innovative and high quality.  <br /> <br />First, the authors are not Chinese martial artists.  They are martial artists with experience in judo or ju jitsu.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is a bit misleading to say this book is about Chin Na in groundfighting when it is simply basic techniques from ju jitsu.   <br /> <br />Of course, the theories between so-called \\"chin na fa\\" (to seize and control) and Ju jitsu (gentle art) are very similar. Yet, a book devoted to Chinese groundfighting and wrestling (Shuai Jiao) would be very interesting, as the prior YMAA book was. <br /> <br />The authors do go into great detail on the theory of Chin Na, especially pressure point techniques. But if you have already read prior YMAA publications on the topic, this doesn't break any new ground.  The use of pressure point techniques in the text borders on the obvious.  Did you know yanking on a guy's hair can make it easier to put a sleeper hold on? <br /> <br />As much as I would like to rate the book higher, there are other YMAA publications I'd buy before I bought this one.  Anyone with common sense could integrate Chin Na with the techniques of ju jitsu, Judo, or the Russian art of Sambo.	2005-02-02

The Option Trader's handbook is a bit more in-depth than most basic option trading texts in that it explains what to do to after you have entered a position. Unlike trading a stock or future, with options, there are many possibilities.  Other books too often neglect the adjustment part of a trade.<br />Most option books describe various spreading strategies, but I know many novice traders complain about picking a directional spread (bull call or bear put), getting the direction correct, only to lose money because the spread still hasn't reached its maximal potential because of time value still remaining.  This book tells you what to do in order to keep much of the profits without increasing risk.  <br />Many of the tactics and adjustments described were alluded to in McMillian's _Options as a Strategic Investment._  But that thick tome occasionally left out a few points complete novices might not pick up.  So if you trade  stock, long options, or spreads, and want to figure out what to do to limit risk, this will explain things clear and simple language.<br />The author clearly demonstrates the beauty of trading options in addition to the underlying security.  There are so many ways to repair a losing position, minimize, or eliminate the risk of loss, I am amazed that options have the risky reputation they do.<br />The one danger with all of these adjustments, however, is that you spend too much time on a trade trying to come out with a small profit, or break even.  From a psychological POV, this knowledge could be dangerous in that you fail to admit a trade hasn't worked. Rather than take the loss, you make adjustments, and focus your energy on breaking even, rather than looking for a trade to make you whole, and then some.<br />One of the negatives--I was hoping the authors would go into more detail on various delta neutral trade adjustments.  There was much discussion on adjusting long or short positions, but not much at all on diagonal spreads, or various typesof ratio spreads.<br />Another issue--there is some advice that strikes me as mistaken.<BR>The author advises selling an in-the-money call option on a stock you own to hedge against a decline while avoiding short term capital gains (p. 89).  My understanding is that the IRS considers this a &quot;constructive sale&quot; and either you are taxed (if you get assigned) or your holding period starts over.<br />But aside from this, the book deserves a place on the shelf of every trader.	2004-06-26

It is the method that discretionary traders like Edwards and Magee would advocate.<br />Trend following is based on events that the market underestimates.  Price action does not follow the normal distribution, as the statisticians would have it. Events that are statistically improbable are much more frequent than chance would allow.  Trend following technical analysis attempts to catch these moves.  <br />The author underestimates the drawbacks of a strict trend-following methodology--large draw-downs, with a large percentage of losing trades.  This drawback--low reliability is also a strength--most market participants are not interested in profitable system with a large number of losers.  A more severe drawback--a large amount of capital is needed to trade such a system to handle the inevitable drawdowns.<br />He fails to address this issue by simply suggesting that if you take enough trades, eventually one will go your way and make up for your losses.  Maybe so.  But who would be willing to suffer draw-downs in the range of 30% or more, waiting for one or 2 big trades to come?  Not many.  Increased market volatility makes trend following systems profitable, but more risky.<br />If you examine _The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies_ you will see that most mechanical systems degrade over time.  Volatility breakout systems used to be very popular.  But with increased volatility, simple breakout systems give more frequent losing trades, rendering them unprofitable for the test period.<br />The author overestimates the performance of mechanical systems, most of which are trend following.  Historical testing tells you what has happened, not what is going to happen. This was the mistake of Long Term Capital Management. Trading, like poker, is a people game played with money.  It isn't a number's game (like blackjack) the quants would have you believe it is.<br />Trading requires you to anticipate changes in investor expectations.  Technical AND fundamental analysis helps you understand the forces that are influencing market participants. Understanding fundamentals can help you filter out the frequent false signals from technical models, while technical analysis serves as an excellent risk management and timing tool.<br />There are many ways of profiting in the market.  Trend following is one. It isn't the best one, nor is it the only one.  I'd argue traders would be better served focusing on classical technical analysis (chart patterns), and then spending most of their time learning how to manage risk.  You can still make money with these &quot;old&quot; concepts, and gain practical experience with the psychology of trading.	2004-06-20

Readers of reviews on financial books need to be careful.  For every 100 people who speculate in the financial markets, less than 10 are successful.  People often have psychological blindspots that prevent them from noticing profitable info when they see it.  I'm convinced that blindspot applies not only to the market, but books about profiting in the market.<br />Despite my skepticism, I had decided to study technical analysis after reading Larry McMillian's advice in Options as a Strategic Investment.  Pring's book on Momentum was one of my first purchases.  Combined with observation of market action using my TC2000 software, I'd say it is one of my best purchases.  And that was over 4 years ago.<br />This isn't easy reading.  It requires you to--THINK!  Imagine that!  Those who are looking for wealth through trading and investing expect the process to be easy.  When they discover it isn't, they blame authors for writing accuarte, but difficult books, rather than changing their ideas about profiting from the market.<br />Other books cover momentum indicators in brief detail, but<BR>Pring devotes significant space to principles of momentum interpretation, as well as how different indicators are constructed.  Of crucial importance is the pros and cons of the construction of various indicators: Momentum or Rate of Change vs RSI, MACD vs Stochastics.  After reading this, you will learn which indicators complement each other, and which ones are simply different variations of the same idea.<br />Unfortunately, as Pring instructs, interpreting momentum indicators requires practice as well as judgement. Knowing how to interpret momentum doesn't mean you can trade eaily.  There is much more to trading than understanding momentum indicators.  <br />Read this book, THINK about the logic of the indicators, then observe the market action using what you have learned.  In due time, you will use the ideas in this book to develop your own indicators, improving on the ideas in thisbook to suit your own style.	2004-05-01

Just about 5 years ago, I began seriously studying the markets.  I was heavily influenced by many experts that this thing called Tecnical Analysis was a bunch of BS.  <br />Five years, and thousands of dollars (in profits) later, I can tell you that technical analysis is a crucial tool in dealing with the fundamental uncertainty we traders deal with every day.<br />Even when I was basing decisions on conventional technical techniques, Elliott Wave Theory seemed like tea-leaf reading.  But knowing what I know about the markets, I kept an open mind. I learned how to apply the basic rules, and was amazed at what I saw.  There is much more to Elliott than I thought.<br />Neeley gives a thorough method for applying the Wave theory based strictly on price action.  He guides you from analysing individual swings, to grouping them correctly into wave patterns.  Once you have a workable count, it is possible to place a low risk, high profit trade on.  <br />The key value in all of this is that you can see a number of possible scenarios.  The one problem with Elliott is the issue of alternate counts.  I've found that alternate counts often disagree as to the magnitude of a comming move, and less often on the direction, if you are using multiple timeframes.  <br />I've actually worked through most of Neely's rules.  I set up a spreadsheet to calculate the retracement levels he indicates in his text.  Having said that, Neely omits one crucial bit of info.  His method is based on retracement levels.  Yet, he never tells you whether to use price levels, or percentages to measure the length of waves.  Since he indicates you should use recent data, I've assumed he meant price lengths in dollars (or whateve currency you use).<br />This is a crucial omission, as price targets are determined by the relationships among waves.  Sometimes using price lengths, rather than percentages, renders impossible targets.  The only way around this is to use percentages for longer longer time periods, and price lengths for shorter ones.  Posner covered this in Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably.<br />One problem is that Neely gives extensive wiggle room in his use of retracements to define patterns.  This means his categories, while appearing rigorously objective, actually overlap to a considerable degree.  You will often be left with 2 choices for a label, despite applying the rules consistently.  That isn't necessarily Neely's fault--he is being realistic.  No one ever said the market was easy.<br />I wouldn't tackle this text if you are unfamilliar with classical technical analysis.  Elliott wave can be a frustrating theory. I've gotten headaches trying to count corrective patterns.  Despite what Neely says, conventional indicators, candlesticks, and chart patterns can be very helpful when wave counts are not. Classical technicals and Elliott often overlap--suggesting the same conclusion. When they do, then you know you have a potential profit opportunity.<br />But if you are familiar with classical methods, and you are serious about learning Elliott Wave, then I can recommend this book.	2004-04-18

Books	3	11	12	N	N	Need to separate the good from the bad...	I browsed through this book today at the bookstore.<br />Others on the web, (John T Reed especially) have gone to great lengths to demonstrate that this man is not who he represents himself to be.  The case they make is persuasive.  A lot of his &quot;advice&quot; is foolish, ambiguous or both.  <br />However, I have to give the man credit. He tells a good story And there are parts to this book that the so-called &quot;investors&quot; need to know: 1) Markets go down as well as up 2) Investment and savings are totally different things.  3) Those who do not understand the risks the stock market entails should not invest in the market--period.<br />I put &quot;investors&quot; in quotes because the ones who are most dependent on an ever rising market to bail them out are the ones who stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that the &quot;buy and hope&quot; method of &quot;investing&quot; is much more risky than the academics, brokers, or money managers make it out to be.  They have no knowledge or plan for buying or selling investments.  They have no understanding of the real purpose of financial markets.  And, most unfortunate, they don't understand that neither the &quot;pros&quot; nor the government have any incentive in educating them about how to use the market most effectively.<br />The author's thesis isn't original, but it is clearly one scenario that could throw out all of the calculations based on the buy and hope strategy out the window.  He speculates that ERISA--which mandates withdrawls from retirement plans at 70 1/2, could induce massive selling, causing a catastrophic decline in the market.<br />Anyone who invests in the stock market should have a plan for if and when a severe decline occurs.  Saying you are a &quot;buy and hold&quot; investor is tantamount to saying &quot;I have no strategy at all.&quot;  <br />This is true even if you are diversified.  At the point of a financial crisis, all the markets are positively correlated--meaning diversification benefits disappear just when you need them the most.<br />Having said that, the author's advice to &quot;invest&quot; in real estate is poorly thought out.  He correctly points out the potential problems when boomers massively sell paper investments (stocks, mostly).  Yet, why won't these same boomers also sell their real estate investments?  Considering the economic scenario he is portraying, boomers will need all the help they can get.  <br />If you haven't read any of his books, this is probably the best one to get.  Then again, while he says you need to have a &quot;financial education&quot;, the money you spend on this book could be better spent elsewhere.	2004-01-20

Too many of them leave me feeling like I wasted my time and money. <br />I decided to go back to the &quot;classics&quot;--Schabacker, Edwards and Magee, Graham, Hamilton, Rhea, and of course, Gerald Loeb.  <br />The more I read these &quot;classics&quot; of investment literature, the more I see the market hasn't fundamentally changed at all.  All of those books have taught me something important, but I will always have Loeb's &quot;Battle for Investment Survival&quot; close to the top of my list.<br />Loeb demonstrates he is fundamentally honest.  Unlike most books, that get you to think becomming a millionare through daytrading is easy, Loeb teaches that there is no such thing as &quot;easy money&quot; in the financial markets, nor are there &quot;safe investments&quot; (bonds) as the value of money is constantly depreciating.<br />He also teaches that there are NO guarantees, and that most people WILL lose money regardless of what they do.  I think this is true, but most people cannot face it--even those &quot;efficient market&quot; types who advocate the buy and holding of index funds.  (I believe Loeb would be a big fan of Exchange Traded Funds, however)<br />So, what is one to do in order to preserve purchasing power?  His answer: intelligent speculation and the ever-liquid account.<br />To speculate intelligently, Loeb advises focusing on actively traded stocks--not illiquid &quot;penny stocks&quot; for your SPECULATIVE activities.  <br />Let's be clear--Gerald Loeb is no &quot;buy and hold&quot; advocate.  Loeb could be considered an advocate of the &quot;relative strength&quot; approach--before the concept of &quot;relative strength&quot; ever existed.  <br />The moment your stock is failing to deliver superior profits, and you have no fundamental reason to believe its uptrend will continue,  he advises you sell and look for another.  If you can't find anything interesting, or the market is going down--you stay in cash.  For Loeb, you MUST avoid catastrophic losses like those sustained in the crash of '29.  A stock that doesn't rise (or fall if you like to short) is a waste to be avoided.<br />Loeb is not a fan of too much diversification.  He thinks it is a crutch that guarantees mediocre performance.<br />His most important teaching would focus on money management (what we would now call &quot;asset allocation&quot;). Loeb would consider it foolish to allocate a significant (more than 50%) of your capital to stocks.  You always need a cushion for those inevitable losses in trading operations.     <br />I've taken Loeb's advice to heart.  His advice is even more applicable to options trading.  <br />By keeping a small amount of money in a volatile asset, and ruthlessly cutting losses, you give yourself a chance to match the market or even outperform, but with significantly less risk (volatility), due to the large cash reserves.  <br />Loeb's advice isn't easy to follow.  But making money isn't easy. And by following Loeb's advice, I'm quite pleased.	2003-12-27
US	50844926	RH7A68SXN7JS	0471420077	138294764	Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably	Books	5	34	39	N	N	A logical approach for discretionary traders...	Most of the literature on technical analysis focuses on easily compuerized techniques, such as moving averages, momentum divergences, volume/price comparisons, etc.  <br />The authors of these books advocate a mechanical approach to technical analysis, and stress the benefits of objective rules to reduce emotional errors.  These techniques have become quite sophisticated, from examining the effect of various money management algorithms, to using out of sample data to test the ability of the system to trade in different conditions.<br />I do not dispute that these techniques have substantial value for some traders.  Yet, for all of this sophistication, I think most of this research is of limitted utility, for the simple reason that past performance has NO RELATION to future results.  If a clearly definable system is discovered by a significant number of people, the markets inevitably change to render that system useless.  <br />Then, once the system is deemed useless by the majority, it's likely they will turn profitable again.<br />Even system traders need to understand market psychology and logic in order to develop robust systems.  This book will help them do it.<br />Mechanical systems neglect the underlying psychology of market participants.  In an environment where the only constant is change, a successful trader needs an underlying philosophy to guide him on what is likely to lead to profits NOW, as opposed to what has happened before.  This is where Mr. Poser's book comes in. <br />Poser teaches you that technical analysis is about understanding CURRENT market psychology.  He does this through the framework of Elliott Wave theory.  He also stresses the importance of other factors--including classical technical tools, computerized techniques, fundamentals, and intermarket relationships relate and enhance the interpretation of Elliot wave theory.     <br />He describes how to develop detailed trading plans that take into account these various factors. As someone who focuses heavily on price patterns and momentum indicators, this is a method that I had sort of stumbled upon independently, as I have gained experience trading the markets.  <br />It isn't mechanical, but it is clearly a logical and flexible framework for those up to the challenge of discretionarly trading.	2003-12-15

The words &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;free market&quot; all too often bring to mind images of ruthless competetion, and the business exploitation of both workers and consumers.  <br />Too many people (who have never been in business on their own) believe the path to business success is through deceptive practices.  They also believe that consumers need government protection.  <br />In direct contradiction to commonly held beliefs, Don Mitchell, a business consultant, has studied the most successful public and private companies, and discovered something very interesting.  The most successful companies are those that constantly revise their business models to meet consumer needs at the least cost.  <br />Example: Ecolab started its business innovation by enabling its customers (mostly restaurants) to keep health inspectors satisfied by sharing its knowledge of chemicals to improve all aspects of restaurant management--from cooking and cleaning to storage and waste management.  Eventually it expanded into janitorial services.  It did all of this while maintaining a competetive price for its products.  No new entrant could match the services Ecolab would provide.   <br />The most important chapter for self-employed people is Chapter 1: Increase value without raising prices or costs.  This chapter provides several ideas on how to look at day-to-day business operations, and find out which areas inadvertently discourage customers from purchase.  The author also discusses the importance of TESTING an idea before a complete revision.  This is more applicable to larger corporations, but start-ups should consider testing the plausibility of the business model before sinking too much money into the project.<br />Although Mr. Michell's concepts apply to a wide variety of industries, one of the few areas not mentioned is health care.  As a health care professional, I'm certain innovation would provide patients with better care for less costs.  Unfortunately, government reimbursement patterns (which most insurance plans copy), severely limit what inventive people can do within the system.  Until people decide health care is like most other goods and services--best handled by a free market,  health care will likely improve practices rather slowly.<BR>  <BR>Bottom line: It is possible to both do good for others, and do well for yourself.	2003-10-13

Being caught up in the study of technical analysis at the time, I clearly wasn't ready at the time to find value (pun intended) in Staley's fundamental approach to the market. This time, however, I'm listening to her.<br />With a bit more experience, I can appreciate 3 of the many lessons _The Art of Short Selling_ teaches:<br />1) Fundamentals drive market action...eventually<BR>2) It is often a costly mistake to short a stock simply because it apepars overvalued.  A catalyst of some sort is needed to encourage massive selling.<BR>3) Markets can ignore negative fundamentals for significantly extended periods of time--giving the astute trader ample time to sell at a profit, or even turn and sell short.  Positive fundamentals are more rapidly incorporated into stock prices, but significant inefficiencies still exist on both sides of the market--long and short.<br />The author uses case histories of significant corporate failures from the 80's and early 90's in light of the publicly available info at that time, which clearly demonstrated the inivetable fall of Wall Street's institutional favorites.  <br />Numerous fundamental techniques are discussed, such as tracking changes in inventory and receivables, as well as tricks companies play to make revenues and earnings appear better than they are.  <br />Also interesting--a high short interest ratio in a stock is often a significant sign of potential trouble in a company.  Do not let those analysts lead you to believe a high short interest ratio is always bullish.  Check the fundamentals and make your own call. <br />Qualitative factors are also discussed, with specific examples on how a close reading of public financial data on one company would have lead you to a profitable short sale of another.  This occurs frequently in the finance and insurance industries.<br />This book is especially important, because every book I've seen teaches which stocks to BUY on a fundamental basis.  No book ever mentions what fundamental factors suggest you SELL.  Even if you never sell short, this is profitable info.<br />Being a student of technical analysis, what struck me is the insight those skeptical shorts had about the companies mentioned.  Clearly, they knew the eventual outcome in each specific instance.<br />Yet, despite being right, most of these guys lost millions by going strictly by fundamentals.  Those who survived incorporated additional (ie. technical) factors, such as relative strength or momentum.  As Keynes stated, &quot;The market can remain irrational much longer than you can remain solvent.&quot;<br />It is clear to me that using both fundamental and technical analysis is the most efficient path to market profits.	2003-04-26

The title definitely grabbed my attention.<br />Unfortunately, the author devoted severaly chapters to various &quot;findings&quot; of academic financial analysts demonstrating a particular trading method doesn't work.  If you aren't familiar with this work, it is important to understand it.<br />I've heard all this before and after much research, I'm not all that impressed with the practical applications of these academic finance theories.<br />For example, in one chapter the author criticizes the trend following methodology, and reports that his anaysis of broad market data (SP-500, DJ-30) over a monthly time period), that instead of trends, you find reversion to the mean.<br />Unfortunately, trend following methods now take into account many other factors--volatility, volume, etc.  Price action alone won't help with trading decisions.  Technical analysis is more than just an analysis of price action.  <br />So his criticism of trend following methods is irrelevant. Most intelligent chartists would tell you that most charts do not suggest anything useful is happening, and one point of TA is to screen the market down to useful candidates.  But there are times when the market action clearly is saying something important.    <br />The interesting portion of the book details a system of trading certain stocks based on value-line recommendations.  Unfortunately, not enough info was given to put anything useful into practice.	2003-04-05

Many martial arts instructors neglect to tell this to their students, probably because they stick to &quot;traditional&quot; training techniques that were developed before the discoveries of sports science.   <br />It is not enough to go to class 3 times a week and expect your body to perform at a high level when you need it to.  The masters of old trained every day, and with the exercises in this book, you can too, and get even better results.<br />Read this and you will have the basic, scientific principles of athletic training at your fingertips.  You will learn about the basic components of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, muscular endurance, muscular power, muscle balance, speed, agility, aerobic and anerobic capacity), and how various systems emphasize different aspects of fitness.  <br />Especially important--the joint stabilization exercises.  You won't find very many instructors teaching these.  I wish I knew these, as I dislocated my shoulder a few times doing judo and kung fu.  They will improve your muscle balance and prevent dislocations.  I've incorporated them into my workout routine.	2003-04-04

The path to superior returns in the stock market is to anticipate changes in investor expectations.  The multi-million question is how to do that.<br />An investor needs to realize the market is made up of 2 broad groups: retail investors (little guys like you and me) and big insitutions (mutual funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, etc.).<br />Big institutions drive market movements.   The people responsible for these market movements have the same professional training, and tend to think alike.  They focus primarily on reports provided by the analysts at major brokerages.  <br />Many novice retail investors look at an analyst recommendation and mistakenly believe it is profitable to act on it.  This book demonstrates why this is the way to the poorhouse.<br />Even though analyst recommendations are worthless, analysts do provide very profitable info--if you know how to use it.  If you look for changes in earnings estimates (upward or downward), you will be able to profitably anticipate the actions of the big guys--who typically chase after earnings momentum.  A positive revision will typically send the stock higher for  1-3 months, making such stocks profitable long candidates for shorter-term traders.  Likewise, negative earnings revisions are good short candidates.<br />Incorporate this fundamental framework with preferred technical screening, trade entry, and exit criteria, and you can develop a very reliable and profitable trading system regardless of market direction.    <br />The book will also educate you on the pressures analysts are under to remain positive about a stock despite the fact fundamentals suggest the company is a poor investment.   The situation will not change, despite government action to correct it, since there really isn't any incentive for major brokerage analysts to be honest.  They have much more to lose than to gain by issuing more sell recommendations.  The stock buyer should beware.	2003-03-30

I strongly prefer technical analysis when it comes to analysing stocks. Price is determined by PERCEPTIONS about fundamentals. <br />By studying price and volume, the chartist can understand what the general market sentiment is regarding these fundamentals, and figure out, with a reasonable degree of confidence, which stocks to buy, and which to sell.  With enough capital, skill, and the discipline to cut inevitable losses, you can make money.<br />Despite the benefits of technical analysis, I can see the value (no pun intended) in understanding the fundamentals on their own.  Fundamentals complement the technicals, and any rational investor will compare market action with fundamental data to come to a profitable conclusion.  <br />My problem: I've tried to read various books on fundamental analysis, but most put me to sleep.<br />This book is different.  It is packed with solid, step-by-step directions on how to perform your own fundamental analysis.  Tips  include screening for candidates, determining a stock's current valuation, setting a target price, and how to determine if the company is a potential Enron or Kmart.  This is far from an exhaustive list of what you will learn.  <br />Best of all, these techniques have been taken from money managers with a track record of beating the S&P, from  Richard Dreihaus to the infamous short seller Jim Chanos.<br />Domash provides a highly readable, useful, and important book for the intelligent stock investor.  Whether you are an investor or a trader, you will understand how those who move the markets tend to think.  Read it if you want to make money.	2002-09-28

In order to make money in stocks, you need to know how Wall Street works.<br />There are 2 schools of thought: technical analysis--the study of market action (price and volume), and fundamental analysis--the attempt to determine of the \\"intrinsic value\\" of a security (stock, bond, etc).  This book is devoted to the various methods of fundamental analysis for stocks, which is the major approach to security selection on Wall Street.<br />The crucial point that you won't find in most books--there is no distinction between growth and value investing.  Any intelligent investor wants to buy a business that has good (not necessarily great) growth prospects, but shouldn't be willing to pay any absurd price for it.  An intelligent investor wants either value or growth at reasonable prices.  Keeping this in mind may have helped you avoid many internet stocks when they were trading at absurd levels.<br />I thought the author did a very good job illustrating the techniques of various successful fundamentalists.  Of course, it would take practice and further study to implement these methods.  <BR>I'd recommend Fundamental Analysis by Ritche, and Financial Scheninagins, by Schlitt, to complement your study in fundamental analysis.<br />If the book stuck simply to describing fundamental analysis, I'd give it 5 stars.  But it doesn't.<br />The author seems to show a total distain for technical analysis.  <BR>This bashing of an alternative method of market analysis decreases the educational content of the book.<br />The value of a company isn't SOLELY determined by fundamentals, but by investor PERCEPTION of those fundamentals, in addition to other factors.  Much info can be learned about investor perceptions regarding a stock by looking at price action, volume, and indicators.  But it takes practice to interpret it.<br />Often, price will decline BEFORE important fundamentals are released to the market.  Anyone reading an Enron chart would have saved a significant amount of cash byselling BEFORE the fundamentals were released.  <BR>A successful trader needs to a) understand the market's perception of a stock b) understand how changes in the fundamentals will change investor perceptions c) decide whether to follow the crowd (follow the trend), or take the other side (fade the trend).<br />Read the book for its good explanation of fundamental analysis.  Take the trash talk about technicians with a grain of salt.  Both approaches can make money, and an intelligent investor will find knowledge about both essential.	2002-09-23

I have numerous chess books devoted to openings, middlegames, and endgames.  After reading these books, my game hasn't progressed to the point where I want it to be.  <br />I've begun to implement De La Maza's training methods, and I think he is onto something, especially with the simplistic chess vision drills.  I'm a talented, but very inconsistent 1400 player, and have been outplaying and defeating 1900 rated opponents on the US Chess Live site since doing these drills.  <br />Tactics and pattern recognition are crucial to chess mastery.  Following his program will drill standard combinations into your brain, so you won't be sitting at the board wondering &quot;What do I do now?&quot;  Even better, you won't hang the queen on move 10, or drop a piece on move 12 like you normally would do.<BR>While his program is good, I think he is a bit unfair to authors such as Silman--who also writes very good books.  There is no conflict between studying tactics AND learning the rules of good play  that other authors teach.  <BR>I'd advise someone who can't follow through with the complete program to emphasize tactics, but reward yourself by studying other books as well.  Silman's books are great.  Bronstein's 1953 chess tournament book is fun to study as well.  Best of all--Jeno Ban's Tactics of Endgames. That will help your tactical ability and engame technique at the same time. <BR>Overall, a helpful text.	2002-09-03

Learn endgames by reading this book	In order to be a strong tournament player, it is crucial to improve your tactical ability and have strong endgame technique.     <br />Jeno Ban's _Tactics of Endgames_ will help you accomplish both.<br />Just a few of the things you will get out of it:<br />1) A strong desire to improve your endgame technique.  The positions in the book look simple, but once you see the subtle (and beautiful) solutions, you can't help but see the complexity in the game of chess.  This will force you to look more carefully when you start to play.  You will even enjoy studying the endgame, which is usually thought of as tedious and dull.<br />2) Improved ability to spot tactics.  Because the positions are relatively simple, basic maneuvers like forks, skewers, pins, etc. will stick out in your mind.  Your standard of play will improve, and you will make fewer blunders, and will be able to calculate farther ahead.<br />I noticed studying a few chapters improved my game very rapidly.<br />3) Improved defensive skills--you will begin to learn how even the most hopeless position can contain elements of poison for the superior side.  Good defensive skill will make you extremely tough to beat. <BR> <BR>Tactics of Endgames is a steal.  Get the book and enjoy trouncing your opponents in the opening, middle, or endgame.	2002-09-03

There are legions of &quot;experts&quot; who will tell you what to buy.  But buying is only half of the story.  Selling, most experienced traders would argue, is more important.  Selling preserves capital, reduces risks, and retains profits. Yet, it is very rare to find someone who will recommend when to sell an investment.  The fact that Cassidy's book is one of the very few that addresses selling a stock makes it unique.<br />Cassidy addresses the common objections to the &quot;buy and sell&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;buy and hold&quot; approach to stock investing, and also provides some guidelines on when to close out a trade.<BR>If you decide to invest in individual stocks, you MUST read this book.  Buy and Hold is for index funds.  The buy and sell approach is a MUST for individual stocks.  If you doubt that, think of Enron.	2002-05-06

I browsed this book tonight at the bookstore.  There are many good ideas in it, especially for stock traders, but also for futures traders.  A few interesting ideas include--using a long term trend following system for low priced, small cap stocks, while swing trading the larger, more liquid, and more volatile stocks.  Elder provides a lot of food for thought about picking the markets you wish to trade in.  <br />However, he annoys me when he talks about options trading by spouting off inconsistent and contradictory advice.  He overemphasizes the risk of buying options while underemphasizes the risks of writing options.  Nowhere in his book does he even mention structuring delta neutral (price neutral) trades, nor does he mention spread trades, which can significantly reduce the time decay risk of holding long options.  His caution about options might save total novices a bit of cash by scaring them out of the market, but more experienced and knowledgable traders won't be impressed with his advice on how to use options.   <br />Indeed, in one section of the book, he advises potential option buyers to select far out of the money options (&quot;options that have all hope squeezed out of them&quot;) if you expect a strong move up or down. (This isn't bad advice as the Black-Scholes model underprices options close to expiration).  But, in the next few pages, he advises traders to sell these very same options (because that is what the pros do).  That isn't necessarily true<br />is poor advice to most traders with limitted capital, who should focus on spread trades. <br />Still, the book is better than most trading books out there.  Read it, absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, and add something specifically your own.	2002-04-29

If you are interested in the stock market (I suspect most readers fall into this category) or any other financial instrument, you MUST read this book, because it is one of the few that focus on the importance of SELLING (exiting) a trade or investment (David Cassidy being the only other).  <br />I started  my investment research by asking a simple question--why do people often lose large amounts of money in the market?  It is because people are told to BUY assets (stocks) but have absolutely NO instruction on when to sell.  Whether it is your friendly stock broker, or your random walk theorist, almost everyone subscribes to the Buy and Hold philosophy--great in a bull market, but what happens when the bear returns?<br />In addition to focusing on exits, Van Tharp instructs potential traders on the crucial importance of position sizing.  Even if you have a money making system, you can blow up by risking too much money on any trade.  Think about how this is possible.<br />I suspect thoughtful readers will look at technical analysis in a new light.  It is probably a better used as a tool to control risk of catastrophic loss, rather than predicting market direction (which may still be helpful on occasion).  Even if short term market action is nearly random, it still pays to get out of losing trades, as you have a 50% chance of losing more money.  <br />Buy the book.  The money you spend now may save you a lot more later on.	2002-04-28

If you trade options, you will quickly learn that it is essential to understand the concept of volatility.  Natenberg explains the concept of volatility in great detail, and shows how this concept applies to different option positions.<br />Natenberg not only takes great pains to explain the concept of volatility, in addition to other inputs into an option pricing model, but clearly shows that option pricing isn't the exact science many seem to believe, for the simple reason that we never know if our volatility estimate is correct.  I suspect many traders just don't understand the severe limitations current models have in different situations (ie. how the Black-Scholes model underprices options near expiration).  <br />For the mathematically inclined, there are ample formulas and equations in the appendix.  <br />Read it, study it, and apply the concepts to develop your own trading system.	2001-01-13

This book won't help you if you don't go into the market with enough money, but it will help you develop your own system (after a lot more research) and figure out how to use options to increase returns or limit risk.<br />This book describes just about every fundamental strategy you could try with options.  It covers the total return concept of covered call writing, the pros and cons of option buying, examines various types of spreads (vertical, calendar, and diagonal) and the various delta (price) neutral strategies.  <br />There is some advanced math here (in an appendix), but anyone of average intelligence and stock market knowledge could follow it.<br />Don't pay attention to those reviewers who trash the book--they have no clue.

This book actually makes an attempt to prove some of its claims with evidence, making it a stand head-and-shoulders (forgive the pun) above the rest.    <br />Bulkowski does an excellent job of describing various formations, providing performance statistics, such as percentage of correct and failing trades, average gains (or declines) and most likely gains or declines.  <br />No book is perfect--I could think of a number of ways to improve the it: 1) some stats on inter-rater reliability--could several chartists see these formations using these rules, and do they come to the same conclusion (bullish, neutral, bearish)? 2) Do chart patterns work better on different types of stocks (large vs. small cap) or sectors 3) how important is the market (or sector) trend when evaluating a pattern?  Should bearish patterns be given less weight in a rising market?  Testing the patterns over several market cycles would also help.  The scope for creative, individual research is endless.  <br />I would hope this book sets a new standard in the technical analysis literature--actually trying to provide some quantitative evidence for theories.  <br />Market technicians, who are always looking for respect from fundamentally oriented traders, should follow Bulkowski  example and become more scientific in their approach.	2000-12-13

Despite my skepticism of many technical analysis (ie. charting)  techniques, I bought this book a) because it was widely acclaimed; 2) I had  hoped John Murphy, a prominent technician, would address some of the major  criticisms leveled against TA.  I was sadly mistaken.  Only 2-3 pages are  devoted to answering the claims of credible research that suggests stock  prices are essentially random.  Murphy's best answer seems to be that  because some charts exhibit trends, technical analysis is validated.  This  is a complete non sequitir.<br />The first half of the book is devoted to  charting methods, which he characterizes as both reliable and _subjective._   Excuse me, but how can a technique be deemed reliable if two practitioners  cannot agree on what the data mean?  This section is heavy on claims, but  lacking any solid evidence.<br />Fortunately, the book isn't a total waste.   There is an extensive review of more reliable and quantitative techniques,  such as moving averages, oscillators, Boillinger Bands, etc.  This part is  probably the most useful portion of the book.  Of further interest is the  use of TA for intermarket analysis, developing trading systems, and the  method of Japanese Candlestick charting, which might have something of  value.<br />A good rebuttal to the exaggerated claims of TA is _Stock Market  Logic_ by Norman Fosback, who has developed some powerful trading systems  of his own.<br />If you are already a convert to TA, you will love this book.   If you are a skeptic, nothing in this text will change your mind.    My  advice: absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, and (most  importantly) add something specifically your own.

Nevertheless, it is a very valuable book, and will help you separate fact from fiction on wall street.<br />Good points:  Learn how to use probability  theory to determine the expected returns of a stock, its likelihood of  profit (or loss), change in margins, etc.  Of particular interest--learn  how to estimate the standard deviation of a stock's returns by using its  high and low prices.  This can save some significant number crunching, and  you can use another short-hand rule to estimate the annual standard  deviation from daily, weekly, or monthly data.<br />Of special importance are  the 5 laws of finance-especially law 2.  Law 2 states simply: You cannot  use historical percentage changes in growth to predict future changes (more  technically, past percentage growth has no correlation to future growth).   What does Wall Street try to do--predict future growth by past growth  (William O'neil readers take note.)  A history of rapid growth is no  guarantee of future growth.  Likewise, a history of poor growth is no  guarantee of poor future performance.  Maybe Ben Graham was right after  all.<br />The one reviewer who said it is typical &quot;technical  analysis&quot; must not have read the same book.  The main premise is that  stock prices follow a &quot;random walk&quot;--meaning you cannot use  simple technical rules to predict future returns with any degree of  accuracy. <br />The author also pokes some holes in the components of  &quot;efficient market theory&quot; especially CAPM.  Beta as a description  of an individual stock's price moves is questioned. <br />Bad Points: The  lognormal distribution was not explained in enough detail.  This is a  significant flaw, as the rest of the book requires understanding of this  vital concept.  Once you can get that, you will reap immense benefit from  this book.	2000-07-01
