The best part of the book is the chapter on humor in the Third Reich, sometimes the other thousands of books on this topic seem to  forget that real people lived their lives during this time, and those lives  included the occasional joke about the government.  Of course, joking about  the Nazi government was not advisable, and the chapter discusses that  aspect as well.<br />The book is filled with information about what it was  like to live as an ordinary citizen of the Third Reich.  There is a small  collection of photographs as well.  Curiously, it leaves any discussion of  the Jews until the last chapter.	2000-06-15

I can remember feeling like I had been punched in the stomach when I found out that she wouldn't get to see  anything ever again.  As I got older, I never forgot that initial shock,  and I realized that if I had had that strong of a reaction, I could only  imagine the way the Ingalls felt.  This book deals with some really intense  and painful times (sanitized somewhat for children), although the family  endures with its typical strength and spirit.  This book is pivotal to the  rest of the series, and should not be skipped just because it isn't quite  as cheerful as the others.<br />This is also one of the few sources I've  encountered that ever described South Dakota as a truly beautiful place.	2000-06-12

The family traditions and affection, the courtship with Laura's obvious strong  mindedness (love the buggy ride with Nellie!), and a wedding at the end  almost makes the book seem a work of fiction.  But knowing that it was  based on Laura's life makes me regret not ever being able to meet her  during her lifetime, since I always felt that I would have liked to have  known her personally.<br />Five stars, and a must for any child to read.	2000-06-12

I wish I had had it with me when I was still traveling to Europe, now I'm too poor so I just read this book and relive my trips.  This book nails so many  things right on the head, even though some of the information (like on  communism) is severely outdated.  But for the college student who wants to  see major locales and get an idea of what there *really* is to do, this  book is supreme.	2000-04-27

To me, the setting and the characters wer so foreign  and different than many of the bland, happy characters in other children's  books, everyone here had a real personality and interacted like actual  humans.  The main story is set in the late 1940s, with a  story-within-a-story that Rosie and Tex spin out as the book progresses.   Both stories are equally interesting, and give something for the child who  prefers reality and the child who prefers fairy tales and fantasy.<br />And  the ending is satisfying to the reader, since it wraps up an ongoing plot  point.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-04-20

Although Caddie is still  present, Clara, Tom, Warren, Hetty, and others get a little story as  well.<br />The book is interesting to a reader of more modern children's  literature in its terminology, especially concerning Native Americans.  But  its heart is in the right place, and those who express negative opinions  about the native people are shown to be wrong.  The book is also somewhat  religious, but not in a specific sense.  Religion is just another part of  the Woodlawns' lives, and the morals in the stories don't pound you on the  head.<br />I remember riding my bike 4 miles to another library to check this  out when I was younger, and I still enjoy the stories today.  Recommended  reading for anyone that enjoyed &quot;Caddie Woodlawn.&quot;	2000-04-20

Although the storylines interact well as they usually do in her works, I care so little about most of the characters that I had to force myself to keep reading.   Very drawn out in places, especially the early descriptions of home life in  the Lynch household.  The female characters are very static, especially  Annie after she hits adolescence.  All we see is her picking at her  brother, and it gets very old after the 6th scene where she tells him to  shut up.  Ria, Rosemary, Gertie, Marilyn, Hilary, Nora, et al, none of them  are people I would want to know.  This is the first Binchy book I haven't  been drawn into and thoroughly enjoyed, so I am really disappointed!  The  modern setting of the book doesn't help it either, and the introduction of  the Internet feels forced.<br />I am sorry I could not review this book more  positively, but I really took a dislike to the whole effort and can't shake  it.	2000-04-10

I read this in grade school (15 years ago!) and never liked it much, but now it's a whole lot better.  It's not a fast-paced, super  exciting book, but life in the 1830s on a farm wasn't exactly fast-paced  either.  When Catherine writes that the family was snowed in and she  knitted all afternoon, that's exactly what happened.  It's not exciting but  life can't always be a thrill a minute.  I thought the language was  appropriate for the times, and the depiction of relationships was  appealing.  The small pleasures of life are recorded, and the problems of  life also weave their way through the journal.<br />If you hated it when you  were young, try it again when you are through high school.	2000-04-04

The realism in this book is more pronounced than it is in the rest of the series, where I always felt somewhat in dreamland with Anne.  Rilla is a heck of a lot more practical than her mother, and seeing  the world and some truly horrible events through her eyes is a big change  from the rest of the books.  At least there is less talking to fairies and  violets and such.<br />Since this is the last book, you are left to wonder  what happens to Rilla and Ken, along with the rest of the cast.  Knowing  now what I know about history, I can't help but hope that WWII doesn't take  quite the same toll on these fictional characters as the First World War  did.	2000-03-24

This is one of those books that really made you feel like you were in the story, especially in the weather descriptions.  You almost feel as though you're out in the rainstorm cooling off from all that blazing  heat!<br />Everything about this story makes the reader feel good.  It is a  simple story without endless action, which can be quite soothing after a  day spent racing around.<br />A quiet book that merited its awards and  continues to be a good read today.	2000-03-23

I borrowed it from a friend, expecting to return it after English was over, but there was no way he was getting that  book back until I was done!  The book pulled me into the story and I  literally read it nonstop until the end.<br />10 years later, I still think  this is a pretty dang good book.  The horror is wound so carefully into the  story that it doesn't seem gratuitous, and the everyday lives of the  characters are so well portrayed that I get a great idea of life in the  1950s.  And the music references are great, with all the lyrics wound  throughout the book.  When Screaming Jay Hawkins died recently, the only  reason I noticed was because I had read about him  in &quot;It.&quot;<br />A  great book, one of King's best.	2000-03-10

I have owned the set for a few years now, and every time I reread the books I notice another facet to the drawings or text that adds  something new to the story.  The first time you read the books, you won't  have time to really look at the pictures, but as you read them again, read  slowly and observe at the backgrounds and the other people in the  panels.<br />I can only imagine how gut wrenching this series must have been  to write for Mr. Spiegelman, but I thank him for doing so.  This story  brings the Holocaust down to such a personal level, the people in the story  are real human beings whose lives don't just begin and end with the  Holocaust.  You get to see how they lived before, coped during, and survive  with the memories of the war years.<br />Finally, to this day I am moved to  tears by the last few pages of the second book.  Although Vladek Spiegelman  comes off as a racist miser at times (i.e., a real human with flaws), the  reunion with Anja is drawn with such genuine emotion between the characters  that it is almost painful to read.  Imagine yourself in that situation with  your significant other and the scene becomes so intensely emotional that  you have to look away.<br />It helps to have a background in the Holocaust but  is in no way necessary when reading this book.  It should be part of  everyone's library!	2000-03-07

The story was simple and the characters sometimes veered towards stereotypes, but overall I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  By the end of  the book, I felt like I knew Tess as a friend, and I enjoyed the concert  scene with the backstage action going on.  I also liked the way Tess  handled her fans throughout the book, it gives some perspective of what  celebrities are really thinking when they meet fans.<br />My one small  complaint is that I cannot stand the name Kenny, and I just can't believe a  grown man still would be going by that name.  Maybe it's a Southern thing?   I'm from up north, so I really don't know.<br />Also thought the Judy  character could have had a more sympathetic treatment, but there's usually  one character in Spencer's books that gets loaded with bad traits and no  redeeming characteristics.  Another small point though and not that big of  a detriment to the overall book.<br />A good light read, one of her better  books.	2000-02-25

This book was an excellent summary of the history of the college, especially in its early years, and how that history played  into the integration struggles.  It was interesting to see how racial  relations at the college have changed and not changed since the 1960s, and  to get another perspective on the Confederate flag.<br />The book is  well-written and it's hard to believe that the author didn't spend her  whole life in Mississippi.  The book bogs down towards the end a bit, but  otherwise is quite engrossing.<br />An excellent book, especially for those  who were not taught much about integration in the South.	2000-02-23

I remember absolutely loving this book when I was young and taking ballet class every week!  The photos are  beautiful, and the text is very thorough in its coverage of what the  average dancer must endure to become a ballerina!  I've always wondered  what happened to those three students portrayed in the book.  Did they go  on to become dancers, actors, what?  Finally, the cover photo (of a young  girl en pointe in front of a fountain) was one of my favorite images as a  child.	2000-01-25

These sights are what Laura was envisioning when she wrote her childhood memories.<br />My favorite picture is the wedding photo of Caroline and Charles Ingalls.  Since they  are always seen from Laura's perspective, it's easy to forget that they  were once a young couple just starting out on their married life together,  with no idea of what the future would bring.  It was just a thought that  occurred to me when I saw the picture.  You just know they never expected  that millions of people in the 20th century would fondly know of them as  the Ma and Pa Ingalls.	2000-01-21

Towards the end, the adventures of Chrissie become ever less believable, but you still want to finish off the book just to see what  happens.  The characters really stuck in my mind, even though this book was  pretty light reading.<br />Very much a teenage angst book, but with some good  twists and excellent descriptions of the setting.  And I was amazed at how  well Hornburg got into a teenage girl's head.<br />A worthwhile purchase!	1999-12-28

Most of her books that I've read just involve adults, and those characterizations  are fine, but the ones with teenagers never ring quite as true to me.  With  &quot;Home Song,&quot; this problem is more apparent than in &quot;Bitter  Sweet.&quot;  None of the teenage characters act like any teenagers I've  ever been around.  I'm 23, so I remember being that age pretty well, and a  lot of Spencer's younger characters remind me of stereotypical high  schoolers from the 1950's.  Everyone is perky and has school spirit and is  just wonderful, and the kids that don't fit this mold are portrayed as  &quot;burnouts&quot; and losers.  Now I realize that the principal's kids  might be a little more involved than others, but that whole high school  really reeked of squeaky clean fiction to me.  Nobody in my high school  cared THAT much about homecoming.  And one more small beef, the book came  out the year I graduated from high school, and big hair (like Chelsea  wears) was so out.<br />Aside from those issues, I enjoyed the book overall.   I liked the adult characters, and I thought that their dilemmas were well  portrayed.  And I really enjoyed Monica, it was nice to see a woman as an  engineer for starters, and she just seemed to have her head on straight  during the whole book.<br />But whatever happened to Ruth and Dean?  We never  get any information about them after Claire runs out of their house.	1999-12-02

It's a nice look at Winona's home life at the age of 8, when the &quot;main&quot; characters  haven't really encountered Winona yet.  What a riot of a character she is!   I've always liked her  character in the rest of the series, so I was happy  to get a peek into her life, meeting her sisters and parents.  And she  really is kind of a funny character, all on her own.  I hope this book  comes back into print eventually, I would buy several copies!	1999-11-23

It was another great look at Deep Valley life, and for me it was great to *finally* see where the heck Sam  came from.  (If you go right from the high school books to &quot;Betsy's  Wedding,&quot; you don't get much explanation who this Sam guy is and what  happened to Larry.)<br />This book made me feel like I was right there at the  house party, with my good pals from high school Betsy and Carney and  Bonnie.  I hope the publisher sees fit to reissue this title, as well as  &quot;Emily of Deep Valley&quot; and &quot;Winona's Pony Cart,&quot; so  that those of us that are B-T nuts can finish our collections.<br />Only thing  is that I wished there had been more about Tacy, since she always was my  favorite character.

When I was in high school, I encountered these in my mom's book collection, and thought the whole series was just great.  &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; is definitely the weakest of  the three, but it's still pretty good.  A few points stand out...<br />Wished  that Cooper's character could have mellowed a bit, his transformation from  &quot;North and South&quot; to this book seemed fairly unbelievable.  Maybe  that was the point though, that sometimes people react very differently  than you might expect.<br />Since I always liked Billy and Brett, I wished I  had known more about their life in CA.<br />And finally, the last time we see  Ashton (wishing she was a little girl again), it is the first time we ever  saw her acting like a human.  After you read that line, any re-reading of  the series will be tempered by the knowledge of her last scene.<br />A good  read!	1999-10-04

But I was disappointed at how skimpy the book was, considering how much research must have gone into its  writing.  The pictures and the newspaper excerpts must have taken a fair  amount of work to find, but the book never talked about any of the research  that Dolnick did.<br />It is nice to see how the book characters represented  real people in Lovelace's life in the Cities.  And it was pretty neat to  see what they actually looked like...since children's illustrations are  generally a bit fictionalized.<br />This book is a nice addition for B-T fans,  but very few other people would really understand this book's purpose.	1999-10-01

I still am not entirely  sure why it is challenged, unless we're still trying to keep teenagers away  from honest portrayals of sex and its potential negative  aftereffects!<br />This book was quite realistic in its depictions of what  goes on in a relationship that's heading down the path to sex, and what  happens afterwards.  When Katherine meets Theo and finds herself liking  him, her mixed and confused feelings are what many young women go through  when they realize that &quot;the one&quot; isn't &quot;the one&quot; after  all.  It's a frightening feeling.<br />Finally, I appreciated the initial  sexual scenes because they were also fairly honest.  Without getting  graphic, let's just say that Katherine's lack of feeling is a lot more  realistic than some of those scenes in other novels would have you  believe.<br />So, I guess the message I got was not to give it away too young,  because &quot;forever&quot; really isn't what it seems.  Is that really a  message we want to ban?	1999-09-23

Although some people have mentioned that artwork is lacking, there is a mention in the introduction that if your child becomes very attached to a particular  story, you could purchase a separate copy of it for ease of carrying.  You  also could consider purchasing a separate copy if you wanted to see the  full artwork.<br />I thought this book was a great overview because you could  read the stories (with reading level indicated by a color-coded book) and  decide for yourself if it was worth spending more money on individual  copies.  I like owning a copy because it has replaced many of my long-gone  paperbacks from my childhood.  Those paperbacks were made to be read, which  means their longevity is limited.  But this hardcover collection of some of  my childhood favorites will (hopefully) hold up much longer.<br />So, I would  buy it as an introduction to children's literature, and let your child  browse and see what s/he likes.  Then you can purchase separate copies  later on.	1999-09-22

Just seemed like no one thought about it at all.  OK, nun one  day, wife a little bit later, whatever.  I was raised Catholic, and I can  tell you that in my home parish, that type of thing happening would have  been gossip fodder for weeks.<br />And frankly, the wedding night at the end  was kind of creepy to me.

I kind of felt sorry for Nancy, getting stuck with a guy who harped all the time about having kids and quitting her job (which provided insurance for them!)  Maybe he should have discussed kids with her before marriage...instead of assuming things!<br />Aside from that, I enjoyed the book a lot.  I got it as a gift when I was about 14 (23 now), and still pick it up occasionally.  I am also from near Door County and am familiar with the settings of the story.<br />I would recommend the book as good light reading, nothing that will shake your world but pretty good .

But  the settings were well described.<br />Wouldn't recommend it.	1999-09-10
