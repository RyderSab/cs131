The charcaters weren't well devolped, and the story line just tumbled along. There were many errors, such as when Marie met the guy's sisters, all of the names began with K, then about 50 pages later, she said she wanted to call his sister Val. I was wondering where Val came from, because that was the first time she was mentioned in the book. I couldn't decide weather Sammie was supposed to be fat, lonely and unhappy, or fat, slutty, and unhappy. Marie talks about being Sammie for sleeping with men on the 1st date, yet she slept with 2 different men on the 1st date. The relationship between Maria and the last guy she met, wasn't developed enough to justify the ending. I was so upset when I read the ending. Upset because I wasted 4 days of my life reading a book that could've been great, if it only had a good editor. Having said that, I will read the author's next book, but only to see if her writing style has improved. She shows great potential.	2005-02-17

Waiting to Exhale, and How Stella Got her Groove Back didn't exactly showcase the talents of Terry McMillan. Mama and Disappearing Acts made an avid fan out of me. They both built a fire in me that made me want more of her books. Waiting To Exhale, and How Stella Got her Groove Back, dampened the fire just a little bit. With a Day Late and A Dollar Short, the fire roaring again. I absolutely loved this book, from start to finish. The characters were well developed; I didn't have to guess what made them the way they were. My favorite character, (Mrs. Vy of course) was witty, outspoken, and a breath of fresh air. A Mother who was able to admit that she made mistakes, and didn't apologize for being human. All of the characters were well unique in there own ways. I recommend this book to any and everyone. To Mrs. McMillan, I would like to say, Welcome Back, it's been along time coming.	2001-02-19

It has history, envy, crime, and most of all, intrigue. This is a must read for every one. I had one problem with the book, I wanted Sugar and her  Great-Grandmother to have it out, to put her in her place. I also wanted  Pearl to tell Sugar that Shirley was her Great-Grandmother. It also would  have been nice if Joe, had told Sugar that he was her father. Other than  that, it still was a very very good book. So good that I didn't want it to  end. Keep up the good work Ms. McFadden, I eagerly await the next book.	2000-06-15

I am so proud to call her a friend. I can easily picture  this book as a movie, a movie that I would go see over and over again. I  will definitely reread this book, over and over again. My book club, (the  Black Book Club Online) will read this book in May, and I can't wait to see  if everyone loves this book as much as I do (I'm sure they will). The  information on the music industry was so accurate, that I had to remind  myself that the book wasn't real.
