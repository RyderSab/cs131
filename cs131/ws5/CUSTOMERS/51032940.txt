Dad rarely talked about the war.  I was a late-comer for my parents and was only 12 years old when Dad died in 1981, when he was 59.  The year before he died, he started writing a journal of his war experiences, but didn't finish it.  We also have an audio tape which my brother made interviewing him, but it, too, was unfinished.<br /><br />Sgt. Felber's diary has helped me to realize things that Dad went through that I wasn't aware of --for instance the nearly constant rain.  And, then there are some incidents that Dad mentioned, too, and it was exciting to see them in print!<br /><br />Although it is a bittersweet journey to realize things Dad endured during the war, it also makes me feel even closer to him (although we were very close).  I salute and thank you, Sgt. Felber for fighting for my freedom and for sharing your diary with us.  God speed	2005-09-20

It is so full of bias and non-facts, it's pathetic.  She leaves out evidence and facts that don't support her opinion.  She seems to think that Olivia Riner was jealous of Leah Fisher.  Leah had nothing for any young (or old for that matter) woman to be jealous of.  She's homely.  Olivia is very pretty.  Her dorky boyfriend is a local hood.  At 22, Leah still lives with and is supported by her parents.  (Sure, she has something of a job, but she is not self-supporting).  Olivia isn't tied down by a boyfriend and is in a foreign country.  She's travelled internationally several times.  If anything, Leah should have been jealous of Olivia.<br /><br />It's obvious that Olivia had nothing to do with the crime other than the fact she was a victim.  Even the family believed she had nothing to do with it until they were convinced otherwise by the prosecution team, which had no evidence, no motive, no real reason at all to charge her.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this book.  If you want to know the facts of the case presented in an unbiased manner, read The Nanny Murder Trial.	2005-08-19

I wasn't afraid to travel alone until her murder.  In fact, I was planning a trip to visit friends that would have taken me through the same area she disappeared from.  After her disappearance and death, I cancelled the trip and didn't travel alone for a few years.  I never forgot her story and created a page for her on a memorial website last fall.  Through that, her mother contacted me.  We spoke  on the phone, but didn't meet until last month at a book signing.<br /><br />I read the book within a day.  It is very well written.  Although I had a respect for the Kimmell family before I read it, having come to know more about them through this story, I really admire them for their courage in fighting for justice and for sharing their story.<br /><br />I have worked in law enforcement for 9 years and haven't seen much \\"jurisdictional\\"  problems.  I think that is partially a result of the Kimmells' efforts due to their experience.<br /><br />Now that I know more about the evil being who took Lisa's life , I honestly believe that Lisa's story might have saved my own life.  Had her story not gained the publicity it did, I'd have been travelling alone a couple of months later in that same area where Eaton lived and hunted for victims.  Lisa and I were the same age.  I may have been one of his victims too had I not been frightened by her story.	2005-08-11

They are dead, so no one can say what they were thinking at various times.  Yet, he tries to, which I really find irritating.  In true crime, I like fact, not the author's assumption.<br /><br />That said, he did an excellent job of writing the story of a very sad case and a very evil man.

I remember the \\"Baby Jessica\\" case.  I remember PRAYING that the adoptive parents would win because I thought that's the ONLY way Jessica could win.  I have several adopted cousins and I cannot imagine their pain had this happened to them.       I cried as I watched that precious little girl being ripped from the arms of her parents and sent to virtual strangers.   The things that Cara Clausen Schmidt did afterward was sickening--things she said to the DeBoers, to the media.    However, after I saw the movie, my views changed.  I felt it was the DeBoers' fault because they should've turned her over when she was just weeks old, according to the movie, but didn't -- they let it go until she was old enough that it could cause permanent emotional damage to her.      But, the book shed the real light on it.  It was not the DeBoers' fault at all.  They were fighting for Jessica and they were the only ones fighting for her, it seemed.      And, to think that the girl today --now known as Anna Jacqueline Schmidt-- is in a broken home, she and her sister living with their father who had abandoned his two older children.      This did NOT have to happen to her.  She could be right now with the family she knew and who would still be together today.  I know the DeBoers divorced several years later, but remarried.    I doubt that would've happened had it not been for the stress of having their child torn from them.   I have a friend who recently lost her three year old to a rare complication of E-coli and I think the grief is very much the same--losing your child is losing your child.	2004-02-13

I've heard lots of good things about his books.  I work in law enforcement and have enjoyed other true crime books written by former law enforcement personnel, so thought I would Wambaugh as well.  I had seen the documentary about John Orr and wanted to know more.  <br />However, although the author is an excellent writer, this book was very biased and Wambaugh comes across to me as very arrogant -- a trait that I cannot tolerate under any circumstance.   In fact, his bias that police officers are better than firefighters is downright cocky. <br />Although I knew the story of John Orr and felt he was guilty, while reading Fire Lover, I found myself wanting him to get off from page to page because of the cockiness of the writer. <br />I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.	2003-12-20

When I was in my teens and in my early twenties, somewhat because of my background, I thought I had to \\"make\\" people love me.  It didn't matter that handsome, sweet, gentlemen were after ME or that 20 people would say I was pretty and sweet and fun.  What mattered was the 1 person who didn't think I was.  What mattered was getting someone I liked to like me back.  I remember one guy I sort of fell hard for (I didn't love him, just chemistry like I'd never felt before) and most of the time he was nice to me, but sometimes he treated me with caloused disregard and I let him.  Why?  Because that's what it took to get him to like me back, then I'd put up with it.<br />Now, at 35, I can't believe I was ever like that.  I think it had to do to not feeling fully loved my my own family and being hurt by them.<br />I don't agree with all the things in this book--for instance, I don't believe in sex before marriage at all.

But, Part I of Murphy's Boy was boring and somewhat hard to follow.  In one paragraph, she'd be somewhere with someone and the next would be a totally different time and scene.  It jumped around like a soap opera, but nowhere near as bad.<br />Part II was much better, but too expedited.  It was almost like saying in one chapter someone found out they were pregnant and in the next the baby had been born--- nothing said of the pregnancy in between.  Part III ended too soon and I really didn't like the ending.<br />It left more questions than it answered in some ways.  For instance, what became of Kevin's real father?  He only<br />mentions him once in the book.  And were the girls his full or half-sisters?<br />Personally, I wanted to knock his mother to the moon !!!  How could anyone, especially a mother, let someone MURDER her child and stand by and do NOTHING?  And, then, take the evil, brutal, twit back and allow him to abuse the others AND in the end give up her children to the state so she didn't have to give up that horrible man??????<br />I love Torey's non-fiction work.

So much for the old saying &quot;It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.&quot;  Rusty IS a rocket scientist -- a NASA engineer.<br />But, he did try to get her help and fought for her treatment that the embicile doctor wouldn't give her.

Especially since I had never even heard of this case, I don't like a writer presenting facts trying to sway the reader one way or the other. There is an underlying tone of bias that becomes more prevalent as the book goes on. I thought of another Ann Rule book that I read that was a little biased, but not like this. She describes Mike Farrar as handsome. Personally, if he is (which he must have something for women to be drawn to him)he must not be very photogenic because the photos in the book show him as rather homely. As the book goes on, I found myself really distrusting and disliking Mike Farrar and and to an extent, his girlfriend, Mrs. David Hacker (Celeste in the book)<br />Mike says he's a loving father and wouldn't leave his kids alone. But, he sure didn't mind leaving his 6 year old virtually alone while he went to the next village to put the moves on another man's wife. He says he was afraid for his kids because his wife was a crazy alcoholic, but he sure didn't mind leaving them with her when he moved out. He obviously didn't care much about Celeste, because after her husband's suspicious suicide, he couldn't even remember if he had her kids' names right and forgot that she wasn't divorced, but that she was a widow. Celeste left her family photos up to show her kids that \\"their family mattered.\\" Yet, she used her husband's funeral as her coming out party, coming public with her affair with a married man, laughing and carrying on. Then, she has her boyfriend coming to dinner before he was cold in his grave! I was 12 years old when my father died suddenly from a heart attack. I can't imagine how hard it would have been if my mother had introduced a new man and had him staying over a month later! My gosh, had the woman no compassion? I was immediately suspicious of Mike in ref. to the fire. His first thoughts when he saw the house fire was of how he'd replace the material possessions -- he didn't even know if his family was dead or alive at that time. And, instead of comforting his distraught wife, he screamed at her \\"What have you done?\\" Okay, that made me think he may have set her up. I wouldn't be surprised if he was doing things to make her go nuts or make people think she was. I thought Celeste was innocent until the fire. Oh, and then, he and his girlfriend go to the charred house not long after his children's bodies were removed to rescue his precious wine collection. Obviously, Dr. Farrar used his charms on Ann Rule, because with Debora's emotions, she uses rough language and criticizes her behavior after her children die. However, I thought her behavior was much more reasonable than Mike's was. While his children were burning to death, he phoned his girlfriend rather than trying to comfort his wife or save the kids. He tells everyone his wife was nuts and wouldn't even let her stay with him. What a jerk! But, everything Mike does is explained in gentle terms. I love Ann Rule, but she really flunked with this book. Did Debora do it? Maybe. Was Mike involved? Quite Possibly. Was Celeste? Perhaps. Will the full truth ever come out? Probably not. However, I do believe Debora did have some major problems. But, Mike Farrar is an adulterous womanizer who seems to love being the center of attention. There is NO excuse for adultery. None. He wasted no time going after Debora, Celeste, Carolyn, or anyone else and when he had his fill, he dropped them just as quickly. He seems to have a pattern of going after other men's wives. Debora and Celeste were both married when he put the moves on them. Debora needed help, but I believe Mike needs psychologic help even worse. He's got some major issues. Mike seems to care about one person only -- himself. The one person that I feel the most sorry for is Kate Farrar who is called \\"Lissa\\" in the book. The poor kid went through a lot. I hope she can make some sort of sense of it all when she is an adult.<br />I'd like to find another book on this -- maybe it would be more factual and less biased.ult.<br />I'd like to find another book on this -- maybe it would be more factual and less biased.	2002-04-01

Since I personally know the author who is a fellow dispatcher at another agency and am good friends with the real-life \\"George,\\" I already knew some of the trip that inspired the book. As a writer myself, I must say that this book is extremely well written. Although I don't fancy romance novels, I did like this, although the steamy scenes were too explicit for me and I didn't like the adulterous theme. But over all, it was a good book.  Good debut, Claudia! I also must add that Claudia Thomas is a wonderful woman. She recently served as a critical incident debriefer at the site of the WTC attacks, counselling emergency workers. She took an entire month off from her job to do this. What an awesome lady!	2002-02-12

My heart goes out to this poor woman, who's life was torn apart by such a tragedy.  It was obvious she loved her husband with every fiber in her body.  It's a shame she didn't love his children like that.  I marveled at someone who would let her adult daughter and grandson live with and mootch off her and her husband while at the same time farming out her husband's 5 year old daughter because they didn't have &quot;room&quot; for her, too, and then wonder, years later, why the girl resented her.<br />Still, it was a very good book and should help anyone dealing with grief.

US	51032940	R1ZB22RZLUSDPR	1872031307	46346663	Chronicle of Aviation	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Mark Pyle	I found this book by doing a search for Mark Pyle as an author in a vain attempt at finding a tape called &quot;Death of An American Dream,&quot; which I know he is quoted on, but I'm not positive he authored.  But, this book looks interesting.  Anything by the last Clipper Captain is a good read to me.<br />&quot;Pan Am has place of it's own.  You call it the world, we call it home.&quot;  Gone but not forgotten....	2000-10-28
US	51032940	R1WWD0O8T8VREP	0671545140	21235155	Leadership Secrets of the Rogue Warrior	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Excellent	I am the Communications Supervisor at a Sheriff's Office.  One of my co-workers is an avid reader of Marcinko.  Out of the blue one day, he loaned me this book.  I put off reading it because I figured he'd be this blood &amp; violence, boring author.  I hate violence and find it boring.  That's why I hate the Die Hard movies.  But, this book is so good.  He's witty and has a no-nonsense approach.  My father was a WWII Guadal Canal veteran, so I have deep appreciation and respect for our military and veterans.  And, I loved the war stories and how he applied them to the &quot;real&quot; world.  I'm hooked on Marcinko now.  He's an excellent writer.  He has my style of leadership.	2000-10-02

We, as women, have so many  different hats we wear and roles we play (well, so do men for that matter).  But, as busy as I am as a female and everyone demanding a piece of me and  not having much time left for myself, I thought that's what the book was  about.  It's more about women in abusive relationships, which I'm not.  So, I guess it's good for what it's worth, but not what I had in mind.	2000-08-26

I found him to be very humble.  As a rescue worker who has  suffered from post trauma stress, I can relate to an extant to what he went  through emotionally.  I think it's an excellent book, very well written.  And to the self-proclaimed agnostic survivor, maybe you need to work out  some of your own problems with your ordeal before you accuse others of  being arrogant.	2000-08-25

As an emergency worker suffering from depression and post-trauma stress for over a year, reading this book and finding so many  similarities with what she went through after her ordeal, released  something in me that I'd been resisting and helped me to decide to finally  get the help that I need and deserve.	2000-07-31

A Surviving Flight Attendant's Struggle and Inspiring Triumph Over Tragedy	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A real life heroine	She is an outstanding writer and this is a wonderful story. She's really a hero and I don't think she even realizes it. She talks of pulling passengers from a burning plane like it's no greater feat than going to the grocery store to buy a box of Cheerios -- all in a day's work type of thing. Wonderful book, wonderful woman. I'm an EMT and am trained to save lives. She wasn't, but made it seem so routine. As a life-long flight-attendant wanna-be, my hat's off to Sandy. I also recommend reading \\"Hail Fire\\" by John Tielking, one of the surviving passengers of this crash.  It is his account of the events and is an excellent book.  He also mentions Sandy's amazing actions on that fateful day.	2000-06-25

I started to in grade school and got bored after 2 pages.  Anyway, I watched the movie recently and was very confused.  It was a pretty good story and apparently  autobiographical, but can someone who is hip on this story answer some  questions.  e-mail me at msbeckaru@aol.com<br />1) Who is Marmee?  The  sisters are Meg, Jo, Beth, &amp; Amy as best as I could tell.  Does the mom  have a name? 2) Is Teddy the same person as Laurie cuz I'm really confused  on that. 3) What are Meg's babies names?  They didn't say in the movie. 4)  Who's the old lady who leaves Jo the poodle and the house?  Is she a  relative?<br />Thanks.	2000-05-11

Too bad all true crime writers can't present the facts in such an unbiased fashion. By the way, according to the book, she was never  diagnosed with any mental abnormality including MSBP.  I'd liked to know  whatever happened to her.	2000-03-27
