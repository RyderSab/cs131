I love 'The Wide Window'.  I love all the audio books of this series.....THE ONES READ BY TIM CURRY!!!! <br /> <br />Mr. Snicket is a fantastic writer.  The SUE books are witty, tongue in cheek, woefully depressing and wonderfully dismal.  Reading them is a treat.  Listening to Mr. Snicket read them is a fate worse than being bitten by the Mamba Du Mal. <br /> <br />Get the recordings done by Tim Curry....SCREAM & run away from the ones read by Mr. Snicket.	2005-08-20

Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life.  Excellent narration, sprightly character voices and the reader's sense of good fun make this recording my personal favorite of 'A Christmas Carol'. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this then pick up more of Mr. Dale's audiobook recordings.  I highly recommend all 6 of the Harry Potter audiobooks *on CD of course as you will wear your tapes out & replace them constantly* and 'Peter & the Starcatchers'.	2005-08-20

For those of us who read HP from the beginning, we are seeing the series progress as the author wanted them to.  Some questions are answered, more questions are raised and in all cases the reader WANTS the answers.  *what IS going to happen w/Lupin?* <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book very much!  Having said that, I think that the author may lose some of the younger fans *kids who really are too young to be reading the series* as structurally the story differs a bit from the others.  This is not a book for eight year olds...sorry, just my opinion.  For those who say it and the previous 2 books were \\"too dark\\", remember that they are designed to age with their readers.  Harry's sixteen now, put 2 and 2 together!!  Older kids & adult HP fans will enjoy this book very much.	2005-08-20

After stretching his vocal legs with 'The Bad Beginning', Mr. Curry returns with Book the Second familiar with his characters and it seems having great fun with them.  This is my favorite of all the Lemony Snicket audios *well alright, Mr. Curry's voice for Capt. Widdershins in book eleven had me rolling on the floor with tears in my eyes laughing...but I digress*.  His voice for Uncle Monty is inspired and worth the price of the CD in itself. <br /> <br />If you love the books, as I do, then you owe it to yourself to get the audios as well.	2005-08-20

'The Witch of Cologne'is a well written story that will appeal to lovers of historical fiction.  I enjoyed it *although I can't really compare it to 'The Red Tent' as one cover blurb does*, and would recommend it to lovers of the medieval/Renaissance genre.  It centers around the life of Ruth, a young Jewish midwife and the religious upheaval of the times *both Christian/Jew & Catholic/Protestant*.  <br /> <br />Although the \\"villain\\" of the piece is motivated by the usual \\"spurned lover/revenge on the family\\" scenario, the author creates well developed characters that you care about.  If you like Phillipa Gregory, Margaret George & Geraldine Brooks, then you will like this book.   <br /> <br />The only negative comment I have is that the cover photograph makes it look like a tacky porn novel, which is most unfortunate both for the author & the book itself, and might turn some prospective readers away from it.  Don't let that stop you though, it is well worth reading.	2005-08-17

'The Cry of the Icemark', although published as a young adult book, is a treat for fantasy lovers of ALL ages. His heroine is both tough, engaging and yet reassuringly human.  Her quest to keep evil from overwhelming her father's *now hers* kingdom and struggling to step into his legendary *albeit fuzzy* shoes keeps the reader engrossed from cover to cover.  I look forward to more offerings from Mr. Hill in future!! <br /> <br />Harry Potter fans should enjoy this one immensely, as will readers of Mercedes Lackey.	2005-08-17

Just what donating your body to science really means?  Ms. Roach presents the facts in a very entertaining *and yes tasteful* narrative.      The author's tongue in cheek sense of humor shows throughout the book & she is a wonderful guide into the \\"life\\" of cadavers in their various roles as teachers and test subjects.      I will be the first to say that 'Stiff' is not for everyone, but if you like science/natural history reads or are just intrigued by all things medical then this is a book for you.

The first 2 books in Lackey's Dragonjouster series were excellent.  The author created a new world, new scenarios, new theme and did them well.  Imagine my surprise when I read 'Sanctuary' the third installment in this series. <br /> <br />It seems that the author, after throwing herself fully into the first 2 books, has lost interest in them and was mainly just trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible and finish the series.  'Sanctuary' could have been a satisfying end to Vetch/Kiron's story...as it was, I was left wanting....	2005-06-05

If you're looking for a blood/guts/Jaws/survival story then *waves hands* shoo!  'Devil's Teeth' isn't what you are looking for.  If you want a good natural history read about the great white sharks of the Faranelles then READ THIS BOOK!! <br /> <br />'Devil's Teeth' is a great first-read for natural history enthusiasts.  It gives information without the sometimes dictatorial attitude that books written by wildlife biologists can have.  Ms. Casey is an average journalist with no specific biological training.  She follows her subject with the passion that comes from truly wanting to be doing what she was. <br /> <br />The author's insights on the Faranelle biologists, the islands themselves, the great whites and the intrusive 'real world' just 27 miles from the 'Devil's Teeth' are peppered with her own unique brand of humor. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this and recommend it without reservation.  If you read it & like it, check out Close to Shore by Michael Capuzo & Ghosts of Tsavo by Philip Caputo as well.	2005-06-05

Mr. Roberts brings his own experiences to light in this wonderful novel that shows his readers what life is really about and what is really important. <br /> <br />I have not read a book like this before in my entire life.  It is a novel that has the feel of a travelogue and the tone of an autobiography and it will pull you in and not let you go until you have read the last word.  Shantaram is marvelous and even though it is in excess of 900 pages, you will reach the end of it wishing that you could still go on. <br /> <br />If you like India, Bombay, travel, personal trials and tribulations or just one cracking good story then Shantaram is a must read.	2005-02-23

Five Quarts is an interesting overview of medical history as it pertains to the circulatory system in general and blood in particular.  Mr. Hayes examines not only the scientific aspect of this most precious fluid, but also the social/religious views of blood through the ages.   <br /> <br />Interspersed throughout is the deeply personal story of his partner's battle with HIV and how this relates to his own perception of blood.  Although not a read for everyone, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in natural/medical history or HIV/AIDS studies.	2005-02-13

I find Patterson lukewarm and Coban intriguing but heavy-handed.  Jeffery Deaver, however, is a superb suspense author...the best in my opinion.  His plots twist and turn and always intrigue...his characters are three dimensional and command a reader's attention.<br /><br />Bone Collector is the first of the Lincoln Rhyme novels and is a great beginning to a great series.  I cannot wait for the next offering from Deaver featuring Rhyme...this author has yet to disappoint me with anything that I've read by him.<br /><br />Pick this book up and read it...even if you have seen the film, especially if you have seen the film...you will get much more out of it.	2004-10-26

'Mischa loved dark purple, loved the color aubergine, for as long as she lived.' --Hannibal p.283 <br /> <br />Mr. Harris has given readers a wonderfully complex and terrifying character in Hannibal Lecter.  We at once are repelled and yet facinated by him and that I think is the reason for his appeal. <br /> <br />'Hannibal' is by far the best of Mr. Harris' books to date.  Although it takes place after the events of 'Silence of the Lambs' it really is not a sequel.  It offers insights into just why Hannibal may be the way he is and provides all the suspense one could hope for.   <br /> <br />Unlike previous reviewers, I found the ending to be intriguing...albeit unexpected.  As much as I enjoy seeing Anthony Hopkins play the character on film I was very dissapointed in the butchering of the climax of the story in the movie.  Read the book...it is worth the time and you will not want to put it down...*well, I did once, but only to say \\"did he REALLY write that?\\" and upon picking it up again say \\"yes...he DID!\\". <br /> <br />If you don't like suspense then don't read this book.

Mr. Timothy Cratchit is all grown up now and coming to terms with the death of his father and indeed with himself.  This tale of mysterious suspense is peppered throughout with excerpts from letters Tim writes to the deceased Bob Cratchit and meetings with/avoidances of his \\"Uncle\\" Scrooge.      If you are a Christmas Carol enthusiast then by all means pick up this book...but be warned gentle readers...this is a story of darkness and depravity, not of good intentions and redemption...lessons of kindness and virtue come from other authors than Mr. Bayard and are given to other kinds of tales than this.	2004-10-15

I cannot confess to being an expert on this time period of history, so any glaring errors between the real heroine's character/story and this novel are lost on me. <br /> <br />What I can say is that 'The Twentieth Wife' is a wonderful piece of historical fiction.  Sundaresan draws you into the world of mogul India and wraps you up in it.

Another interesting turn from Mercedes Lackey.  Although the book paints an engrossing portrait of WWI torn England, it is basically a retelling of the familiar Cinderella story.  While I see where she was trying to go, the overall effect was spoiled for me by over the top aristocratic characters, Reggie in particular.  One can only stand so many \\"I say Mater!\\"'s in a book, after all.    If you like the cozy feel of the Lord Peter Wimsey stories, then you will enjoy this book.

An interesting and fresh take on the 'genie of the lamp' genre and younger readers will no doubt enjoy it.  Adult readers who enjoy such offerings as the Harry Potter books and Series of Unfortunate Events will be left wondering where the rest of the story is.    The author takes very clever ideas, such as the whole concept of kids who are half jinn and half human, wishes and TV loving dogs; interesting characters and places both in a very linear plot.      I will check out volume 2 just to see if the author takes off after stretching their limbs with the first book.	2004-10-02

A very quirky and intriguing read!  Rats combines the observations of 'urban wildlife', NYC history and a social portrait of the pest control industry *well as it relates to rats!*.   <br /> <br />Mr. Sullivan takes on a creature that is maligned, misunderstood and indeed little studied because, well, we're talking about rats.  His take on the natural history of the animal itself is interwoven with the story of the alley in which he watched his subjects and peppered with first hand experiences gleaned from NYC's pest control specialists. <br /> <br />Especially intriguing for me was the portion of the book which discussed the unsung & unpraised pest controllers that came from all over the country to help with the 9/11 clean up.  They helped contain a potentially volatile population explosion of the rodents and even though I live far from ground zero, they have my gratitude and thanks.   <br /> <br />The book is well worded and will engage the reader's interest and hold it.  Pick it up if you are a NYC, history or wildlife enthusiast.	2004-10-02

As an avid travel reader and as the spouse of a Hungarian I was pleased to pick up this book. Ms. Brue has a wonderful writing style, both informative and with a wry wit that shines thru beautifully.  Cathedrals of the Flesh is a great read.  At the end, the author lists major baths from around the world and indeed this is what inspired me to pick it up *several baths in Budapest are listed*.  I am assuming that the author did in fact visit the baths listed, but there is nothing in the book on public baths in Hungary.  Considering the rather large chapter devoted to Russia, this is disappointing to say the least.  Having said that and admitting that this is a personal criticism on my part, the book istelf is very good.  I look forward to reading more from this author.	2004-08-15

Exile's Valor is the follow up to Lackey's recent Exile's Honor.  It is the continuing story of Herald Albereich and gives us a look into the young Queen Seleny's life after the death of her father and leading up to the birth of Elspeth.  <BR>While it is nice to have prequel material to the Arrows of the Queen series provided to us die hard Valdemar fans, I am dismayed that the minor &quot;vanity&quot; character Lackey created in previous Valedemar works has been given a major role in this book *there is no doubt about this, given the character's name is Myste*.  Exile's Valor seems to be more about Lackey's indulging in private fantasies than in really telling a story that is a good addition to the Valdemar Canon.  If a third book in the Valor series is forthcoming I will most likely check it out at the library rather than buy it.  By all means pick up &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;Alta&quot; and &quot;The Fairy Godmother&quot; by Lackey however.  All 3 are cracking good and should be added to any fantasy library!!	2004-05-29

Hillenbrand takes the individual threads of each peron's *horse's* life and weaves them together into a glorious tapestry that will satisfy even the most finicky of readers.  If you like horses, racing, American history or a tale of the underdog then Seabiscuit is for you.

Mr. Capuzzo's Close to Shore combines the natural history of the great white shark *and what went wrong in the case of this animal* with an overview of the social history of the US in 1916 into a non-fiction read that moves like a good novel.  If you are looking for a sensational blood n' slash shark book, go somewhere else.  If you are looking for a dry, historical account of the facts, go somewhere else.  If you like your history text presented in an interesting and personal way then this is most definitely the book for you.  I can think of several history/natural history writers who could take a cue from Michael Capuzzo.  I hope we see more from this author in the future!!  I highly recommend the audio book as well.  It is read by Len Cariou *if you know musical theatre then enough said!!* and is a great matching of vocal performer and material.	2004-05-29

Joust is a cracking good beginning to a new series from this established fantasy writer.  In it she takes on a new world *a great adaptation of Ancient Egyptian blended with her own ideas* and focuses on the great war between two nations:  Tia and Alta.  The book's protagonist, Vetch, is a young Altan serf who is taken from his master and made to serve the Tian Jousters, soldiers who ride great dragons into aerial combat against Alta.  Vetch's new master, Jouster Ari, is the only dragon soldier in either country to have hatched and raised his own dragon.  During his time with Ari, Vetch comes to appreciate the strength and beauty of the dragons and manages to steal an egg to raise on his own.  He also learns that not all Tians are the &quot;Great Enemy&quot; of Alta and must come to terms with what his life will have to be once his dragon hatches.  Lackey shines with this new series and with fresh material and characters I cannot wait to see what further adventures Vetch has in store for him.  Buy This Book!!!	2004-05-29

From what I read of it...actually I didn't finish it due to lack of interest.  I read the press kit for the book and was hooked by what appeared to be an engrossing storyline and the background of the author himself.  Sadly, the book failed to deliver as promised.  Try it if you like darker, gothic, evil attempts to take over the world type of books, but I don't know how the press thought this would be the \\"next Harry Potter\\".  J.K. Rowling is in no danger of losing her laurels.	2004-05-29

First of all let me say thank you to this very talented and creative lady.  I have enjoyed all the Harry Potter books from  the beginning and am pleased to see the integrity and quality of the series  maintained so well.<br />One always hopes that a sequel will bear out the  reputation that the original book has carved for itself.  Harry Potter and  the Goblet of Fire doesn't just maintain the standard, it raises the bar.  One of the things about this series that I enjoy so much is that the aging  of the characters is handled realistically and in good literary style.  Harry's fourteen now and the social/life problems he's encountering are  pretty much the norm for any adolescent. Well, an adolescent wizard anyway.  I urge all fans of the series to read Goblet of Fire.  As for myself, all I  want to be is the next Professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwart's!  Kudos Ms.  Rowling, keep up the great work!	2000-08-15

It has been a long time since a series not in the fantasy genre  has captivated my attention and imagination the way Ms. Karon's Mitford series has.  As a former resident of WNC, I find her firsthand insight to the  people, the region and the atmosphere to be right on the mark.  I love the  fact that I could step out of my own doorstep and see each and every  character in the series as my friends and neighbors.  Well Done!<br />In A  New Song, Ms. Karon continues the great thread she has begun and the shift  of Fr. Tim and Cynthia to Whitecap from Mitford only adds fresh vitality to  this series.  The characters are solid, the dialog very real and the book  moves from the very serious to the sublime.  *the deep sea fishing trip was  so funny, I had to put the book aside and surrender to a laughing  fit....thank you for that! *<br />If you have enjoyed Mitford up to now, then  by all means read A New Song.  I fervently hope that Ms. Karon continues to  bring us the news from Mitford for some time to come.	2000-07-30

I am an avid admirer of &quot;The Canon&quot; and indeed all things Sherlockian and I must say that of all the Holmes-Addendums out there, and Ms. King's novels are by far the best.  *I have read some horrible attempts  at using the Holmes character/genera and a few good ones, none can match  this series!*   Mary Russell's character has depth, and believability.   Holmes is presented in a style that rings true and yet is more dimensional  than Conan-Doyle's original creation.  I purchased the book initially in  PB, and came back to get the series in hardcover.  A good investment as  these are books that you will want to read over and over again.  I cannot  recommend The Beekeeper's Apprentice highly enough.  Kudos to Ms. King and  I hope she continues to add to this great foundation for some time to come.	2000-02-12
