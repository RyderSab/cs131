I literally blew through \\"Gates of Fire\\" by Steven Pressfield. It took me just three days and was just as good as I remembered it from the first time I read it.    \\"Gates of Fire\\" is about the Battle of Thermopylae that took place in 480 BCE. In 480 BCE, a hand-picked force of three hundred Spartan warriors along with their auxilia and allied forces (Numbered around 5,000 combatants) took on the nearly two million troops of the Persion despot, Xerxes the Great, and brought the advance of the despot to a stop for nearly a week valiantly sacrificing their lives in an action which saved the Peloponesse (Greater Greece) and very likely saved democracy and modern society as we know it. Pressfield's prose is very engaging and he manages to bring the battles of history alive in a way that endears the protagonist to his reader and makes the reader want to learn more.    \\"Gates of Fire\\" is a great book and I highly recommend it.

US	49197174	R23AFFAHYBKAB2	0345253515	683546187	The Road to Ramadan	Books	1	8	21	N	N	Anti-Imperialist Egyptian Passion Play	Mohamed Heikal is one of the few Egyptian writers to have been widely published in the Western World and his ?Road to Ramadan? is one of his earliest works detailing the Arab (Egyptian and Syrian) part in the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Egypt, Israel and Syria and in a larger context between the superpowers of the USA and USSR. I have long studied military history as well as the background of the Middle Eastern conflict and was interested in hearing the Egyptian side of the 1973 Yom Kippur War (which he also calls the Ramadan War and the October War). Unfortunately, Heikal tells very little about the war and instead focuses on his worship of Nasser, his own ?wondrous? exploits and praise of the Socialist institutions of Egypt at that time. It?s only in the last seventy pages of the 283-page book that he even begins to address the war and only then in terms of praise for the Egyptian army (which was summarily beaten on the 1973 Yom Kippur battlefield even though Heikal has difficulty saying that).<BR> The book turns into a paean of praise to the wonders of Egypt?s autocracy under Nasser, and later Sadat, presenting one-sided views of the Egyptian government?s failings, many of which Heikal repudiates in his later books when it became politically expedient to do so. Among the more blatant of his gaffes is praise for Sadat, whom at one point he calls the ?elected? leader of Egypt, which is a statement that has little to no truth in it. My copy of this book was written in 1976 before Muslim extremists assassinated Sadat and Heikal spends much of the book alternately praising Nasser and Sadat. In some of Heikal?s later books written after Sadat?s assassination, he readily demeans Sadat and calls him a fool. The book is really no more than the semi-official government opinion of the ruling Egyptian elite as expressed through the mouthpiece of Heikal. Having lived in the former Soviet Union, I can say that this book not only resembles shoddy Soviet propaganda but also is apoor copy of propaganda that already stunk in the first place. <BR> Among the book?s other failing are a very large number of typos and English usage errors (which I?m assuming Heikal himself wrote since he constantly praises his own command of the English language and no translator is credited). The reason I call the book an ?Anti-Imperialist Egyptian Passion Play? is because of the presence of the large number of speeches that Heikal claims are paraphrased from Nasser?s secret meetings with Soviet and other world leaders. In Heikal?s writing, Nasser always utterly out-speaks everyone else in the world, ?proving? how much better he is than everyone else. The speeches resemble nothing less than the passion plays of early Christianity. As an enthusiast of military history, I find that the book provides little in the way of maps, orbats or other useful information. This book is a political diatribe: no more, no less.<br />I cannot recommend this blatant and dated piece of propaganda, which is both poorly written and edited. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2004-06-22

For someone just beginning to study the Arab-Israeli conflict, it can be overwhelming. This book is a collection of maps drafted by a professional cartographer to show the real dimensions of treaties, ceasefires, boycotts, and other historical moments in the Arab-Israeli conflict. <br />Would you like to know exactly which land the Oslo Agreements included?<br />Would you like to know which parts of the Middle East belonged to biblical Israel?<br />Would you like to know which parts of Britain's Palestine Mandate they forbid Jews to dwell or buy land on?<br />This resource can answer all those question and more graphically showing you the exact boundaries of, countries involved in, and other important aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. I particularly found this resource helpful in disputing allegations by people that \\"such-and such a percentage\\" of the land was to be given up in a treaty such as the original U.N. plan for Palestine or under the Oslo Agreements. After showing my fellow debater the actual maps, the arguments were ended since I was in possession of hard fact thanks to this fine reference book. <br />Sir Martin Gilbert is a well-acclaimed British scholar, who has written numerous titles in the Historical Atlas series, extensively written about the Arab-Israeli conflict, and was also officially appointed to write the biography of Sir Winston Churchill.<br />I have reviewed the 1984 Fourth Edition, but several editions have since come out with updated information and additional maps to reflect more recent developments.  I recommend getting the most recent edition available.<br />I highly recommend this outstanding resource for anyone studying the Arab-Israeli conflict, whether pro-Arab or pro-Israeli.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2004-01-04

Make no mistake, reading \\"Genesis 1948 - the First Arab-Israeli\\" is no small undertaking. The book's 830 pages (without the preface) consist of some 793 pages with the text and accompanying maps while the remaining pages consist of extensive notes, a bibliography of more than 500 sources and a large and comprehensive index. The book is simply put, an epic of modern history and I highly recommend it as such.<br />The story is told in one of the best ways possible... from the vantage points of the participants. Much like the much-acclaimed best seller \\"O Jerusalem\\" by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, Dan Kurzman. The author of  \\"Genesis 1948,\\" conducted extensive research into the history of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence consulting over 500 books, newspapers, periodicals, pamphlets, diaries and documents (written in a number of languages including French, English, Arabic and Hebrew) in addition to conducting a large number of interviews with participants from every side in the war (Egyptians, British, Israelis, Transjordanians, Americans, UN personnel, etc.). He ranged from the Arab League Library in Cairo to Government Press Department Library in Tel Aviv. He took all that information and cobbled it together into a dramatic human-interest story full of facts and referenced detail.<br />Some have called the work biased and &quot;home team&quot; coverage, but I strongly disagree since you can look up any of the author's facts and read them for yourself. Having said that, I do feel that the author had more sympathy for the Israeli side, but it's also clear that he had considerable sympathy for the poor Arab farmers (fellaheen) forced to fight a war in Israel in which most didn't believe. I have been reading the history of the modern Middle East for many years (from both the perspective of the Arabs and the Israelis) and I don't feel that the author left out significant details of the history especially considering the work was originally written in 1970 before the climactic 1973 Yom Kippur War. Contrary to other reviews, Kurzman has no problem talking about Jewish terrorism during the pre-1948 period and also heavily criticizes the Israeli side throughout the book. On a likewise note, Kurzman was lucky to make contacts and conduct research in the Arab world before the 1973 Yom Kippur War after which the Arab world largely closed up foreign access to Arab libraries, media sources and interview possibilities.  <br />------------------------<br />Dan Kurzman wrote the following of his book (on page xi of the preface):<br />\\"I have checked every fact to the extent possible, and discarded any questionable information that could not be verified. In the case of conflicting and irreconcilable accounts of events, I generally present them with all of their sources. Quotations and reflections are taken from diaries, memoirs, and other documentary material or from personal interviews. I rarely use dialogue, the accuracy of which has not been confirmed by at least two of the participants in the exchange. Thus the language is as authentic as any that might be used in an autobiography of the person quoted\\"<br />\\"Using the techniques of the novelist and biographer, I have tried to bring the history alive. To a large degree, history, is the story of people; and this book describes their role in one of the most poignant and important stories of our time.\\"<br />------------------------<br />What really makes the book work is its' honest and endearing first-person perspectives of the participants of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence. It's hard to not to find some admiration and respect for people like Abdullah Tel of Transjordan, Sayed Taha of Egypt, the enigmatic David Ben Gurion of Israel, or even Gammal Nasser, future dictator of Egypt. Their stories are told making full use of their own biographies, diaries and such. Lesser-known figures also have their stories told and it was the stories of some of these \\"minor players\\" that really endeared \\"Genesis 1948\\" to me.<br /> I highly recommend this extensively referenced history of the 1948 War for Israeli Independence.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-12-28

Their goals as authors are more political than historical. This book is mostly a collection of conspiracy theories that claim to \\"prove\\" that the Jewish people are evil monsters without providing evidence to support those points.  <br />Here are some of the allegations of \\"The Israeli Holocaust Against the Palestinians\\" as well as refutations of those claims:<br />- ALLEGATION: That 20,000 civilians were slaughtered by the Israeli armed forces in Beirut, Lebanon in 1982 on orders of Ariel Sharon:<BR>- FALSE:<BR>- Lebanese fighters (not Israeli soldiers) loosely allied with Israel committed the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camp massacres and under legal review recognized by national judiciaries the world over, Sharon was declared negligent but not responsible for those massacres. Evidence now points out that a Syrian spy set the Lebanese forces against Palestinian refugees (and terrorists hiding among them) at Sabra and Shatilla.<BR>- See - \\"Operation Peace for Galilee: The Israeli-PLO War in Lebanon\\" by Richard A. Gabriel<br />- ALLEGATION: That a massacre of a huge number of Arab civilians occurred at Deir Yassin in 1948:<BR>- FALSE: <BR>- While it is true that many people were killed in combat between Jewish Stern and Irgun forces, increasing amounts of evidence point out that the people were not civilians or noncombatants. While some of the victims were not adult males, but were women and children, the whole village had been supporting Muslim soldiers. Under international law, such people are fair targets of war. Residents of the village had been sniping at Jewish food convoys to Jerusalem and Muslim rebels had sited a mortar in the village that fired at Jerusalem and Israeli food convoys heading towards it.<BR>- Regardless of responsibility, the Israeli government condemned anyattacks on women or children and the Stern and Irgun groups were both declared illegal and disbanded. This stands in stark contrast to the public encouragement of \\"shaheeds\\" (martyrs or genocide-bombers) that the majority of Palestinian-Arab society condones.<BR>- See - \\"The Palestine War 1948\\" by Efraim Karsh<BR>- See - &quot;Battleground: Fact &amp; Fantasy in Palestine&quot; by Samuel Katz<br />- ALLEGATION: That Baruch Goldstein killed forty Palestinian-Arab worshipers in 1994 at a mosque in Hebron:<BR>- TRUE: <BR>- On Friday, February 25, Dr. Baruch Goldstein of Kiryat Arba near Hebron enter the Tomb of Patriarchs (Machpela Cave) in Hebron and began to fire into a crowd of Muslims with his automatic rifle, killing twenty-nine and wounding many others.<BR>- Israeli Jews in Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank) as well as Gaza immediately expressed their unequivocal condemnation of the attack and expressed their condolences to the victims. This stands in stark contrast to the public encouragement of \\"shaheeds\\" (martyrs or genocide-bombers) that the majority of Palestinian-Arab society condones.<BR>- See - \\"Politics, Lies And Videotape\\" by Yitschak Ben Gad <br />- ALLEGATION: That the Israeli state has been oppressing and killing Palestinians-Arabs for over fifty years:<BR>- FALSE:<BR>- Since 1948, the Arab population in Israel has increased in size from 160,000 to more than 1.2 million today. Arab women vote in Israel, something they do nowhere else in the Middle East. Not only that, but the Israeli government gives more aid to the Palestinian-Arab refugees than all but one or two of the larger Arab governments.<BR>- Rather, evidence points out that Arab governments have long been killing and oppressing the Arab Jews of the Middle East whose communities were destroyed. A large body of literature supports these claims.<BR>- See - \\"Locked Doors: The Seizure of Jewish Property in Arab Countries\\" by Itamar Levin<BR>- See - \\"The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands\\" by Malka Hillel Shulewitz<BR>- See - \\"The Arab-Israeli Conflict: Its History in Maps\\" by Martin Gilbert<br />- ALLEGATION: That the Israeli lobby, which creates a media spin that, controls the US government fools the American public: <BR>- FALSE:<BR>- The US government is controlled by the people of the USA as expressed through the President and Congress. Lobbying is a legal practice (within limits, of course) in the USA and while pro-Israeli lobbies have been more effective at arguing their point of view than Arab lobbies, they do not \\"control\\" the US government. Rather increasingly, Arab-American lobbies and organizations like CAIR are becoming more effective at convincing congressmen and other politicians of their cause.  <BR>- See - \\"Poison\\" by Raphael Israeli<br />- ALLEGATION: That Israel is destroying Christian churches in the Holy Land:<BR>- FALSE:<BR>- Israel's official religions are Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. All of the churches and other places of worship in Israel are respected by the Israeli government. There are large Christian communities all over Israel. This starkly contrasts with the majority of Arab countries where it is actually illegal to be anything but Muslim. The Christian communities in Judea, Samaria (also known as the West Bank) have been shrinking since the Israeli government turned over control to the Palestinian Authority. The majority of Palestinian Christians in these areas are emigrating and many have written of oppression by Muslim radicals.<BR>- See - &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict (2nd Edition)&quot; by Mitchell G. Bard<BR>- See - \\"From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine\\" by Joan Peters<br />Conclusion: <BR>The major part of this book seems to be a broad sided indictment of the Jewish faith and  Jewish people rather than of Israelis or even of the Israeli government. <br />I strongly recommend tossing this book in a rubbish bin.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-11-20

This book, in particular, focuses on revealing the human-interest stories of several Israelis before and during the Six Day War of 1967 (In the Arab world this conflict is often called the June War).<br />About the Author:<BR>Ted Berkman is best known for his novel &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow,&quot; which later culminated in a 1966 film by the same name with an all-star cast including Kirk Douglas, Yul Brenner, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, and many others. Mr. Berkman is also known for his careers as a newspaperman, screenplay writer, composer, and United Nations official. <br />Individual Stories:<BR>Mr. Berkman tells the human-interest stories of the following Israeli citizens:<BR>1. Major Avihu: <BR>- A Sabra (native-born) Israeli pilot in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) who played an important part of the preemptive strike that destroyed the Arab air forces.<BR>2. David &quot;Dudu&quot; Sela: <BR>- Another Sabra and a world-class cellist and mechanized infantry commander. <BR>3. Robert Szereszevski: <BR>- A PhD professor with an interest in African economics and development born in Warsaw, Poland who survived the Holocaust. Robert was physically unable to join the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) but none-the-less, managed to join an Israeli infantry force that helped retake the city of Jerusalem.<BR>4. Colonel Mordecai &quot;Motta&quot; Gur: <BR>- A Sabra farmer, family man, and kibbutznik who led the armies that retook Jerusalem. He later commanded the IDF and led a distinguished military career.<BR>5. Naftali Cohen: <BR>- A Jewish exile from the Arab countries who became an infantryman famed for his bravery at the militarily significant battle at Ammunition Hill.<BR>6. Esther Arditi Zalinger: <BR>- An Italian-born Jewish nurse whose journey to Israel and fearless dedicationto saving lives led her to venture into live fire. She managed to save many lives including those of several of the enemy Arab's soldiers (and a few friendly Arabs as well).<BR>7. Yaacov Basil: <BR>- A Yemeni Jew tankist and an example of perseverance in the face of difficulty.<BR>8. Many others.... <br />Book Notes:<BR>Mr. Berkman obviously did an impressive amount of research into the Israel of 1967 and his novel, through exploration of the stories of so many Israelis, reveals the strengths and weaknesses of Israeli culture. Among the strengths revealed is Israel's knack for bonding together an incredibly diverse group of people from the far corners of the planet (All parts of the Arab world, Europe, North America, and even Asia). Among some of the weaknesses revealed are the societal conflict (and discrimination) between Ashkenazi Jews of mostly European heritage and Sephardi Jews of primarily Asian (mostly Middle Eastern and North African) heritage. Mr. Berkman uses the term Oriental to describe Sephardi Jews, which in that day was considered acceptable (although the term Oriental in these days in considered politically incorrect). I mention this because I wouldn't want younger readers to misconstrue the use of the term as meaning that the book is insensitive to others. 1969 was another time and social realities were different (let alone language). <BR>Book Evaluation and Recommendation:<BR>While I enjoyed what the stories revealed about Israeli society, the true treasure of the novel are the people stories. The feelings, hopes and desires reveal a world more about Israel than their actions could. This novels works as a great companion to any of the political or military histories of the Six Day War. I would also like to mention that Mr. Berkman writes using American-English idiom, which might require referencing for some non-American readers (baseball analogies, American political idiom, etc.). Although it is not academically referenced or footnoted, the writing is very poignant and captivating. I found the book a very entertaining read that was hard to put down. <br />I highly recommend this book as good background material to any study of Six Day War of 1967 or to anyone interested in the social realities of Israel. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-10-01

US	49197174	R29RIHJW8W59A0	0553139207	537392076	The Centauri Device	Books	1	20	60	N	N	Drug Culture Inspired Drivel	...EXTREMELY POOR DISJOINTED WRITING:    My initial impression of this 1974 novel was that this book was written on a dare from some of the author's friends while smoking. The novel is inundated with British slang terms and what appears to be a number of invented phrases that aren't referenced or explained in any manner as to give them meaning. The first chapter was a particularly bad example of this with the book's protagonist mumbling away phrases that could be conjecturally connected with a rock group and some sort of a drug smuggling trade.     Popular counter culture stereotypes abound including that the government is \\"the man\\" and all bad. At parts, I wasn't sure if the author was experiencing a drug \\"trip,\\" because the writing wanders in all sorts of odd directions that little to nothing to do with the story.    Here's an example (Page 12):    \\"He leered at a receptionist (who sat behind the keyboard of her input terminal as long-legged and unapproachable-by losers-any ice-princess).\\"    UNCONNECTED PLOT ELEMENTS:    In several areas, the author mentions plot hooks and develops them only to never bring them up again. I don't know why the author wrote so many possible fruitful plot hooks to abandon them. Good editing would have taken away these annoying and unproductive plot elements.    UNEXPLAINED BACKGROUND:    The author does little to explain how the IWG and IASR came to be dominant elements of his future universe or how them came to be in opposition let alone what other political forces exist in the universe. My theory is that the author simply borrowed plot elements from the newspapers of the day (the book was written in 1974 after the news headline stealing 1973 Yom Kippur War between the Arabs and the Israelis). At one point the author mentions that his protagonist at one time worked for the IWG  as some sort of bounty hunter of terrorists.    In an infuriating manner, the author constantly mentions future technologies and historical events without explaining them or even relating them to the plot. To cite one example, Harrison's \\"Chamber Gun\\" must be a fearsome weapon, but we never hear more than its' name. No mention of it's special effects or even working is explained throughout the novel.     POORLY DEVELOPED CHARACTERS:    The three main characters Captain John Truck, IWG General Alice Gaw, IASR Colonel Ben Barka are all poorly developed and suffer from stereotypes. Truck is the most believable character, a burnt-out drug smuggler, rock musician, and utter anarchist. I believe that the author inserted his own personality, beliefs, and philosophies into this character. Gaw and ben Barka are supposed to be \\"evil\\" representatives from the Israeli and Arab governments, but both appear rather to be petty stupid thugs. Neither shows any authenticity of Arab or Jewish philosophies and even their names lack a Hebrew or Arabic language touch. We never learn more much about either ben Barka or Gaw except that they are power-hungry meglomaniacs who are guilty of numerous violent crimes and are both seeking the doomsday to destroy the other. This plot might have worked out had Harrision spent much time developing either character into people.     IGNORANCE ABOUT THE MIDDLE-EAST:    So many of Harrison's plot details are poorly thought out and lack believability. Apparently Harrison must have a very poor understanding of Islam since he rarely mentions even the slightest detail about it. His UASR is apparently just a stand-in for the USSR. The UASR has more in common with communism than any Arab government ever has. Even Arab nationalism is rarely used. The closest he really gets to any Arab culture is to have a spaceship named \\"The Nasser.\\"    I feel well assured that Harrison has never read the Torah, Koran, or Bible. He has problems applying ANY of the concepts from those books to his characters. Gaw for instance doesn't appear to have read the Torah or applied any of its' lessons to her life or actions. Ben Barka doesn't have the slightest idea about the Koran despite being an Arab and Muslim (Of course, it never really was clear that he was a Muslim despite commanding a ship called \\"The Nasser\\"). Truck also appears to be an atheist completely devoid of any religions, spirituality, or even moral ideas as well as an anarchist in the classic sense of that word.     --------------------------------------------------    I don't recommend this extremely poor novel even one iota.

This book was one of the treasures from my last used book foray. <br />One of Lloyd Arthur Eshbach's greatest strengths is that he combines the mythos and ethos of multiple cultures into tangible fantasy worlds. While in the beginning of the novel, Eshbach leans heavily towards Celtic mythos including flavor language such as laddie, dinna, sidhe, etc., it doesn't take long before Eshbach begins weaving into the story elements of Norse, Persian, Ancient Chinese, and even early Christian mythos. It was this wondrous mixing of exotic cultures that I liked best about the novel. <br />The novel begins shortly after Alan McDougall's younger brother disappears while doing archeological research in the Scottish highlands. Alan, naturally, flies out to Scotland to search for his brother. While hiking in the hills far from cities and civilization, Alan feels a sudden inclination to dig under an ancient Oak, a natural hiding spot, where he finds an ancient Celtic blade and an armband of curious design. No long after, a furious storm strikes and Alan runs through the wood searching for shelter when he happens upon an ancient tower, a broch, in which he takes refuge from the storm. Despite being a musty and old tower, it turns out that a guardian of sorts, a giant druid, who announces that the armband and sword that Alan found are his, inhabits the tower. Alan slays the monstrous druid in a fight to keep the word and armband. <br />After the fight, Alan explores the tower and finds an old brass doorway leading outside. After passing through the gateway, Alan discovers that the outside is curiously different than the woods that led to the old tower. The trees are curved an ancient like those out of an old Chinese painting. Strangest of all, there is an aurora borealis affect in the sky, a regular panoply of vibrantcolor. <br />Alan discovers later in the story that he has entered an alternative universe created by Satan at the beginning of time, and people by a motley crew of Celtic gods, Fomori (monsters from Celtic mythology), ancient Chinese warriors guarding princesses with porcelain faces, Norse warriors intent upon reaching Valhalla through combat, ancient Persian evil, a mob of zombies with hollow soulless bodies and a variety of other surprises. In an effort to escape, Alan becomes embroiled in the politics of this ancient world and finds out that nothing is what it seems in Satan's world.<br />I really enjoyed this charming and well-crafted fantasy novel and highly recommend it to others.<BR>  <BR>Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-07-08
US	49197174	RLWJ4LWULTKDQ	0553287354	543172974	Warriors	Books	2	8	21	N	N	Saudi Propaganda and a Weak Fighter Novel	Barrett Tillman is a well-known aviation writer an enthusiast. He has written over thirty books about the W.W. II United States Navy and USN carrier aviation. \\"Warriors\\" was his first venture into fiction. This novel is just plain trash: unbelievable concept, subtle anti-Semitism, and an unabashed worship of Saudi Arabia. The writing is mediocre and not up to the high standards of Tillman's historical books. <br />--------------------------------------------------<br />UNBELIEVABLE CONCEPT: <BR>The basic plot premise of the novel is that the Saudi Arabian king hires a former United States Navy (USN) fighter jock to build a Top Gun fighter school for the Saudis who will then unite the Arab World to destroy Israel. The only thing that the Arab world has been able to unite behind so far is Israel's destruction.  This is believable. However, the idea that the more radical Arab states would submit to being led by \\"more moderate\\" Saudi Arabia is very farfetched. <br />DOGFIGHTERS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE:<br />The USN fighter jock makes three assumptions:<BR> <BR>1. \\"Only airpower can defeat airpower\\" <BR>2. \\"Pilot quality is the decisive factor in combat between aircraft.\\" <BR>3. The F-20 Tigershark, a cheap and simple fighter, will have better mission turn-around rates than more complicated multi-mission aircraft.  <br />In the book, a Top Gun school is set up for the Saudis to make them into world-class aviators, which is done by recruiting fighter aces from around the world to be their teachers. These foreign pilots train Saudi aviators to be fighter jocks and the best pilots among each class return to teach other Saudis. Meanwhile, a maintenance corps required to keep F-20 fighter planes up and flying is set up.<br />Tillman's idea is an interesting one, but it's also a rather far-fetched concept. This book was published in 1990 and during the 1991 Desert Storm conflict, Saudi Aviators proved to be less than impressive flyers. This isn't to say that there aren't some world-class pilots among the Saudi armed forces, but as a group, Saudi flyers didn't perform well. Despite flying some of the most technologically advanced aircraft in the world, Saudis still have great difficulty maintaining their weapons and are still dependant on Western technicians to maintain them. <br />Saudi Arabia also still has an abysmal literacy rate despite great efforts to educate the Saudi population. It is true that many Saudi Arabians are very bright and well educated, but this tends to be only among the highly privileged who can afford to study abroad. It's hard to imagine that one fighter jock could turn so many societal shortcomings around and build the necessary resources to train adequate numbers of pilots and technicians to destroy the Israel Air Force. <br />Perhaps another questionable assertion that Tillman makes is that, in future warfare electronic warfare, opposing electronic weapons will cancel each other out (Page 272) making radars near useless. History, to date, has taught us anything but this lesson. <br />SUBTLE Anti-Semitism:<BR>Tillman writes about Israel with a subtle animosity although he apparently has respect for the Israeli military. The US administration is very upset with Israel. Tillman is able to justify this by having Israel successfully invade Jordan under the pretext of destroying terrorists. Tillman's US government is prepared to appease terrorists and give in to moral relativism. Even when Saudi Arabia and Israel go to war, the US government doesn't treat Bennett and other foreign aviators as mercenaries or worse (Page 96), which they most definitely would be if they were fighting for foreign powers. <br />Not only that, Tillman drops a piece of information frequently used by anti-Semites, Bennett's brother was stationed on the USS Liberty, a US spy ship that wandered too close to the war zone during the 1967 Six Day War and was mistakenly fired upon by Israeli combatants (Page 58). In Tillman's defense, he does mentionthe Stark and Vincennes episodes. However, Tillman conveniently transforms his dropping of the Liberty into an excuse that it would be in the best interests of the USA arm Saudi Arabia. In another quote, Tillman blames the Israelis for the lack of peace in the Middle East (Page 234).  <br />Tillman also repeats the sorts of assertions that the anti-Semitic Arab media continues to make to this day (Page 132-133) without putting such information into perspective or revealing it for being false:<br />``'But you know the Jewish influence in America.' Aziz's voice had a brittle edge. `It is endless, there is no bottom to it.'<BR>Musad was about to reply that he could not blame any nation or group that acted from self-interest. It was the way of the world. Aftah looked up from his notes. `Yes, that is so. The Israelis can do almost anything they wish where the U.S. is concerned. They can spy on the Americans; they can lobby against American interests in the U.S. Congress. They have even killed Americans with impunity.' <BR>He looked over the top of his bifocals. `They cannot produce oil for the Americans. But we can.'\\"<br />That entire quote is chocked full of anti-Semitic mistruths.<br />SAUDI PROPAGANDA:<BR>Tillman must have gone to a Saudi embassy for his research and historical background. It is blatantly pro-Saudi and brushes over any questionable information regarding Saudi history and legitimacy. He frequently quotes the Koran even using quotes from the Koran to describe the Saudi Arabs as perfect warriors (Page 109) from whence comes the title of the book. <br />The great majority of novel advocates that Saudi Arabia and the USA should be closer allies... <br />--------------------------------------------------<br />I recommend AGAINST reading this book. <br />It is very poorly done. While there are many good ideas, the bad ones far outweigh the good ones...<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-06-25

Perhaps one of the most unique features of this book is its' attempt to take as little stand as possible on the questions of Israel and the Palestinian-Arabs. At points, the author seems to take a passive stance towards supporting Israel's radical left such as political organizations like Peace Now (Gush Shalom) that advocate the Israelis taking the same disastrous path as the Oslo War and the current and deadly 2003 Road Map proposed by President Bush's administration. In parts, the book come perilously close to the fallacies of moral equivalence, which is to say holding the fireman to the same level of guilt as the arsonist. This was probably the weakest aspect of the book. <br />\\"Heroes - Tales From the Israeli Wars\\" tells the story of seven different Israelis:<br />1. The Animal: Aryeh \\"Biro\\" Dayan: \\"Biro\\" is one of Israel's most colorful characters and has been extensively written about in most histories of the 1967 Six Day War as well as a few books about the 1948 War for Israeli Dependence. He is a death camp survivor complete with a Nazi-tattooed number on his forearm. His fame, however, comes from being a consummate, aggressive, and utterly uncompromising soldier. <br />2. Uzi Yairi: \\"He Hated the Army and Loved the IDF\\": An Unlikely Paratrooper: Uzi Yairi has become one of Israel's most famed commandoes while harboring a sensitive personality unexpected of soldiers. He fought courageously in the 1973 Yom Kippur War and was later slain while stopping terrorists who landed by boat and took over an Israeli hotel complete with hostages. His story is the colorful one of a man forced to defend his country while desperately hoping to see peace.<br />3. Chariot of Fire: Israel Tal: Major General Israel Tal is well known as \\"the father of Israeli armor\\" since he not only organized Israel's armor into an effective professional fighting force that achieved overwhelming victory in the 1967 Six Day War, but later headed the design program that created Israel's homegrown tank, the Merkhava (Chariot). The story of the use, development, and later manufacture of armor is a fascinating one. Another often overlooked detail is that while Tal is often credited as the creator of the Merkhava, another engineer is also given credit who well deserves it, Brigadier General Israel Tilan.   <br />4. His Brother's Keeper: Eliazer, Moshe, and Amos Joffe: While the first three stories are typical stories with military heroes albeit from unconventional viewpoints, this story begins the divergence from usual hero stories. It tells the stories of a family and their experiences in defending Israel, but also of the pain and suffering of one family and particularly of three brothers. Among the most poignant aspects of the story are the brothers' dedication to one another, even going so far as to check up on one another in the middle of combat. Tragically, one of the brothers is slain during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and one of the brothers goes above and beyond the call of duty to find his body and return it to his family for proper burial. \\"His Brother's Keeper\\" is very much a human-interest story.<br />5. The Strangest Tale: Ilan Eschel: Ilan Eschel's story is one that shows Israel's determination to survive no matter the odds. Much like Avigdor Kahalani, the famed Israeli tank commander, Eschel suffered crippling wounds several times and returned to service after each dehabilitating wound thought unrecoverable. The story culminates in his returning to his home kibbutz to his own funeral after being mistakenly reported dead. <br />6. Guni and Raya: Guni and Raya Harnick: Raya Harnick is an Israeli English teacher, a well known Hebrew language poet, one of Israel's most vociferous peace protestors, as well as the mother of the late Guni Harnick. This story is one of the longest in the book and tells the story of Raya's life from raising Guni Harnick to be an Israeli patriot to his death at the Battle for Beaufort during the 1982 Operation Peace for Galilee. The story also details her protests against the 1982 Operation Peace for Galilee and the members of the Israeli government she holds responsible for her son's death. The story reflects Raya Harnick's politics as a member of Peace Now (Gush Shalom), a radical Israeli peace organization, and holds much less human interest than the other stories because of it's obvious political stance. This story was the weakest in the book.<br />7. A Will to Live: Smadar Haran Kaiser: Smadar Kaiser is a woman who has lived with unimaginable tragedy, the loss of her entire family (a husband and two young daughters) in a terrorist attack. Rather than send her life in constant sorrow, she dedicated the rest of her life to not living in fear and vowed that within a year's anniversary of the tragedy, she would remarry and raise another family, a vow, which she faithfully kept. Her story is probably the most emotionally laden of the book and it's hard to even conceive of the terror she has endured. Despite being the victim of Arab terror, Smadar hold no hate for her oppressors and hold that unless both Arab and Jew can overcome the tremendous pain that they have endured that no peace is possible. I disagree with some of Smadar's politics, but her story nevertheless is a very inspirational one.<br />I recommend this book, but not highly do to the author's attempt to minimize taking a stand on issues that desperately need people to take decisive and moral action. I gave this book four stars for this sad shortcoming.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-06-22

It is written in a popular format rather than an academic research format although it does have extensive references and a large bibliography. The book is clearly intended for popular consumption rather than discussion of university academics. Hammel is a well-known military writer and has extensively written about WWII although this is his first foray into the volatile military environment of the Middle East.  <br />Many read this book expecting a full account of the war including every aspect manageable: political, economic, military, etc. Hammel's specialty is military history from the tactical perspective (that is to say devoid of all but the most important political and economic factors) and this book is no exception. Hammel focuses very tightly upon analysis and retelling of the battles that occurred and the military factors that led <BR>to them. This tendency leads Hammel to discuss the many terrorist intrusions into Israel that the Israeli military was forced to lean how to counter (a factor that contributed greatly to the effectiveness and readiness of the Israeli military), but to leave out much of the bitter inter-Arab politics preceding the 1967 Six Day War. <br />The book lacks footnotes, but has an excellent bibliography, which includes not only books, but periodicals and special studies. An additional bonus is a complete Order of battle for the Israeli, Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian forces of the 1967 Six Day War. <br />I definitely prefer this well-written book to but A.J. Barker's \\"The Arab-Israeli Wars,\\" which shows a unsettling bias towards the Arab side of the conflict.<br />I highly recommend this excellent account of the 1967 Six Day War.<br />In addition, I recommend the 2002 \\"Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\\" by Michael B. Oren. This book has the most up-to-date research, extensive reference, and is bound to be regarding as a classic for historians regarding the Six Day War. As much as I've characterized Hammel's \\"Six Days of War\\" as the best secondary source popular history of the war, Oren's \\"Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\\" functions as the best secondary source academic reference of the war. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-06-22

One of the surprises of this last week for me was the gift of this book from a close friend who had just returned from a publishers' convention. Knowing me as a Russophile (someone who enjoys Russian culture), he purchased this short little book (64 pages), which bills itself as:<br />\\"An irreverent look at the beliefs and foibles of nations, almost guaranteed to cure Xenophobia.\\"<br />The basic gimmick is to describe a country and its' culture through the use of sarcasm and humor. It really works! I laughed out loud several times while reading it.<br />I have spent the better part of a lifetime studying and living Russian culture and this little book did an incredibly humorous and enjoyable job of describing it. I think that if I ever return to higher education, I'll use this book along any introduction to Russian language, literature, or culture. <br />Here's a short excerpt (rear cover):<br />\\"Russians treat the law like a telegraph pole: you cannot jump over it, but you can go around it. It does not matter in the least what the law is about, because laws in principle cannot be good or useful to the man on the street. This is probably the only law every Russian would agree with. So, when you absolutely must not, but want to very much, you may.\\"<br />The whole book is just as humorous with little mini-essays about a variety of topics including: character, attitudes and values, manners, custom and tradition, and many many other topics. This small little book would probably be much more useful to a businessman or tourist wanting to get more out of a visit to Russia.<br />I highly recommend this humorous little book.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-06-12

I enjoy reading science fiction novels for entertainment, but still miss the heyday of pulp magazines and all the wonderful novelettes and stories they featured.<br />\\"Lord of Blood\\" by Dave Van Arnam was written in 1970, but the content is as classic as the sci-fi pulp novels of the 1920's and 1930's. <br />The book itself is a sort of amalgamation of Conan novels, Indiana Jones featurettes, post-apocalyptic adventures, and a variety of exotic backgrounds. The story's protagonist, a barbarian named Valzar, is captured and enslaved at the beginning of the novel. The rest of the novel describes his experiences in escaping slavery through indentured servitude and beyond. Most of the novel would seem to be fantasy, but the world on which the story takes place is the ruin of a once proud star faring race before the bombs fell. Remnants of technology still survive as well as the effects of the great war. The book is a sequel to another novel by Van Arnam called \\"Star Barbarian.\\"     <br />This book was a welcome bit of entertainment and I highly recommend it to sci-fi enthusiasts and role-playing gamers.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-06-12

I enjoyed reading this novel very much. It was very nice light entertainment.<br />Jake Saunders and Howard Waldrop, the authors, have fashioned an extremely entertaining post-holocaust action novel in the rebellious remnants of the United States. It's obvious that both spent a lot of time reading and researching before the novel was written because there a quite a few disparate elements successfully rolled together in this light entertaining novel. Among the elements are: Wild West Texas Rangers cowboy story elements, an interest in the Arab-Israeli wars, an interest in W.W.II military hardware, an interest in Cold War politics, and probably, above all else, a projected post-nuclear Armageddon scenario.<br />The novel was written in 1974 and parts of the novel cobbled together into a novelette previously appeared in Galaxy Magazine in July, 1973. This story was probably written during the height of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and probably the authors drew much inspiration from what appeared in the newspapers, magazine, and other media of the time. <br />The authors built an alternate history in which 1992 a limited nuclear exchange and widespread use of biological and chemical weapons has killed nine out of every ten people in the world. The two coalitions were a Chinese-Irish-Afrikaaner versus a Russo-British coalition that eventually allies with the United States. Europe waffles and is mostly destroyed in the crossfire. The Israelis stood neutral and their sworn Arab enemies attacked Israel, but with little result. Egyptians bombers managed to hit Tel Aviv, but after that brief attack, the Arab world was all but destroyed by Israeli military might. As neutrals, Israel managed to avoid all but the lingering effects of the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) exchange and stands as one of the last prospering enclaves of humanity. In fact, Israelis so prosperous that they have an overpopulation problem. Enter story plot element one, Israel now hires out its excess population as mercenary soldiers to the rest of the world.<br />Meanwhile, in the shattered remnants of the USA, Texas declares independence and a second US civil war develops, with a Second Lone Star Republic arising driven by oil interests and the SA, Sons of the Alamo, a white supremacy Gestapo-like group holding the power behind the throne. Israeli mercenaries have been hired out to both sides of the war and the book's protagonists are a mixed unit of Israeli tankists and reinforcements from the federal government. Their mission is to penetrate the heart of Texas and rescue the kidnapped president of the USA.<br />However, the World War has not only destroyed the world's population, but along with that population went the many technicians who maintained the technology that not only drove high-tech societies, but their military machines as well. Any weapon surviving is thrust onto the field including W.W.II museum pieces, M-4 Shermans, M-3 Grants, and even a Stuart tank. The federal Israelis start out in updated British Chieftain and Centurion tanks, but are quickly moved into vintage armor as they take losses. A little high technology exists such as main gun cannons replaced with laser weaponry, but most of the weapons are conventional arms from the 1970s and before.<br />Several historical personages are written into the story including Israeli generals Yoffe and Sharon. Sharon, in this alternate future, is a general hired out to the Second Lone Star state instead of being a future president of Israel. The cameos were fun to read. The authors seem to be a little prescient as well since they predict a 1982 Arab-Israeli war that did occur. <br />The story very much reminds me of the Steve Jackson Games universe called Car Wars or the movies Mad Max and The Road Warrior. All of the popular apocalyptic background is there including the particular character of Texas that all writers from that state seem to imbue their work with. Among my favorite humorous elements were giant cockroaches the size of small dogs that are now hunted for sport and in one Texas cantina; the protagonists find one mounted over a bar. <br />I highly recommend this fun little sci-fi novel. It's not art or high literature, but it is a great read!...	2003-05-30

Their book reflects one of the first primary research sources regarding not only the physical fighting, but also the political actions that led to the war. The book is a primary source since both men fought in the 1967 war for Israel, Kimche in the Sinai and Bawly on the Jordan Front. They had access to resources such as interviews with Egyptian prisoners of war that cannot be reproduced by later researchers. Many later historians have agreed with their analysis of the political factors of the war. Unfortunately, while the research is good, many of their conclusions are problematical. The book also suffers from the lack of good reference, lacking good notes, a bibliography, and other methods of supporting their claims. In their defense, many of their suppositions are supported with limited footnotes.<br />As a military history, the book is very comprehensive and the readers, as direct participants, write a good story covering the military facts of the 1967 Six Day War. The review of the political situation of the time is very comprehensive providing multiple possible reasons for the Egyptians to have acted as they did as well as a very good background to the terrorist movements trying to foment the war. Kimche and Bawly's commentary on Judea and Samaria are quite authentic of many Israeli liberals from the era, but are problematical in light of later actions by the Israeli government.  <br />I mildly recommend this book for its' authentic commentary although I think many of the author's conclusions are hastily reached and not well supported. In other words, this book is an excellent research source, but read a better written and better supported book if you are starting research of the 1967 Six Day War.<br />In addition, I recommend the 2002 \\"Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\\" by Michael B. Oren. This book has the most up-to-date research, extensive reference, and is bound to be regarding as a classic for historians regarding the Six Day War. Oren's \\"Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\\" is simply the best secondary source and academic reference of the 1967 Six Day War. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-05-20

The story is about the encroachment of urban life on the small town village. It had an incredible integration of Central American Indian themes that I really enjoyed. I want to say more, but I'm afraid I might give away the story.<br />Avram Davidson's story \\"Duke Pasquale's Ring\\" is set in his alternate 18th century universe of Doctor Englebert Esterhazy and includes witchcraft, aristocracy and, of course, a cat!

US	49197174	R1N9RF13UIAFCX	0451086929	569268473	Phoenix	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Captivating Spy Novel	I picked up this novel, which bills itself as \\"the best espionage thriller since `The Day of the Jackal,\\" and it delivered what it said it would. The novel was riveting keeping me interested from start to finish. I read all 298 pages in a short two days. It was a great novel and I hope that every novel I read is at least as entertaining as \\"Phoenix.\\"<br />The plot revolves around a Libyan assassination attempt against Moyshe Dayan, foreign minister of Israel in 1978. Moyshe Dayan is largely believed to be one of the chief architects of the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel in 1978, and was groundbreaking for the time since most Arab states has agreed to a policy of three \\"NOes\\" formulated in August 1967 at Khartoum: NO peace with Israel, NO negotiations with Israel, and NO recognition of Israel.<br />In the novel, the Libyans attempt to assassinate Moyshe Dayan because they believed him to be the only Israeli capable of negotiating with Arabs since he was an Arabic speaker and grew up around Arabs, being familiar with Arab culture. The same formula is still practiced in the Arab world, in a strange condition where art mimics reality, and there are still radicals trying to kill in order to derail peace agreements. Violence often does derail peace talks too.<br />One of the most frightening parts of the novel is the assassin, Phoenix, who is an utter psychopath and a malicious genius at the same time. He speaks half a dozen languages flawlessly without accent, can change his appearance at the drop of the hat, and will kill without hesitation. He is also a master planner, always extensively preparing before making any move.<br />One of the reasons the Phoenix is so convincing is that the author, Amos Aricha, is a former chief superintendent of the Israeli police force, and is very familiar with the operations of Interpol, espionage agencies, and what kind of criminals are successful. In writing about the Phoenix, he combined the traits of \\"successful\\" criminalsto make a mastermind of evil. <br />Amos Aricha is also a wonderful researcher, which is evident in the amount of real-life political and diplomatic personalities in his book. Mr. Aricha writes:<br />\\"This story of a Libyan plot to assassinate an Israeli political leader is entirely fictitious. However, the names of some real world leaders and some actual international political events have been incorporated into the story for the purposes of creating an authentic fictional background.\\" <br />I highly recommend this frightening espionage novel.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-05-04

Many of those pilots were W.W.II aces and came from many different countries and parts of the world. These pilots and other non-Israeli volunteers are now known as Mahalniks and are highly honored in Israel. This is the courageous story of one such Mahalnik.<br />Brian Cull, a well-known military aviation author, coauthored \\"The Desert Hawks\\" using Leo Nomis' journal as well as many oral interviews and consultation with Mr. Nomis. <br />With most of the material being from Mr. Nomis' journal, the book reads like a diary from the times, a sort of snapshot in time of the craziness and desperation that went on in 1948 Israel. The majority of the text flows very well, but for the less patient, some of the details may be a bit much. I enjoyed the details and, even more so, because this book is a primary research source. Many of the other histories of the 1948 Israeli Air Force have many less details (and in some cases much less accuracy) than \\"The Desert Hawks.\\" In particular this book highly benefits from Brian Cull's editing who has filled in many of the blanks that were unknown at the time Mr. Nomis wrote his journal (such as the identity of the Italian-built fighter planes that Egypt used in the war's later stages). Perhaps, one of my greatest delights came from the photo insert, which has all of the photos fully labeled (many of which have appeared in other histories of the Israel Air Force). I have seen some of the photos in many other books about the Israel Air Force, but never with the men named in the photos. The book is also adorned with several useful maps, quite a few charts researching the early IDF/AF aircraft, and some other interesting appendices.  <br />The book's full title is: \\"The Desert Hawks - An American Volunteer Fighter Pilot's Story of Israel's War of Independence, 1948.\\" The title of the book comes from the name that Arab ground forces had for the early Messerschmitt 109G (called the Avia S199 by the Czechs) fighters that Israel first operated. Out of fear and awe, they called these early fighters \\"The Desert Hawks.\\"  <br />I highly recommend this wonderful primary resource about the history of the 1948 Israel Air Force.<br />I also recommend several of Brian Cull's other titles including \\"Spitfires Over Israel\\" and \\"Wings Over Suez.\\"<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-30

I first became aware of him after reading his book \\"Fighters Over Israel,\\" a very cogent and incisive account of the rise of Israel's air force and the many battles they have fought. Mr. Nordeen has done no less with this book; he has turned out one of the best overviews of the effect that missiles have had on aerial warfare since the Vietnam conflict until the Falkland Island War and the various wars in the Middle East as of the book's 1985 publishing date.<br />The book has an introduction, ten chapters, two appendices, notes, a glossary, an index, and a very comprehensive bibliography. The book devotes the first two chapters to the Vietnam conflict detailing the constantly evolving tactics between North Vietnam's excellent air force and air defenses versus the combined air forces of the United States. The next two chapters detail the little-known conflicts between Pakistan and India, which were a paradigm for the shape of aerial warfare to come. The next four chapter detail the many Arab-Israeli wars as well as inter-Arab warfare such as the conflict between Iraq and Iran. The book's last two chapters detail the short but intense Falkland Islands conflict and draws conclusions about the effect and direction missiles have had on military aviation. <br />The supplemental material at the end of the book is extremely useful: lists of aircraft, aerial cannon, missiles, and bombs. The notes reference all of the hard data that Mr. Londeen uses. If you want to know where he read that information, look it up by footnote and you'll find it. The glossary is of immense use to those of us studying military aviation who weren't a part of military aviation. For instance, do you know what an Ironhand flight is? If you don't, both the text and the glossary have ready explanations / definitions for you.<br />The bibliography is very comprehensive and uses books from both sides of every conflict where they were available. When reading about the Arab-Israeli conflict, for example, Mr. Londeen has made every effort to quote both Arab and Israeli sources. In fact, rather than state that \\"so many aircraft were shot down on this day,\\" Mr. Londeen states both sides' claims and often additionally references other sources that support those claims. For example, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War (known popularly in the Arab world as the Ramadan War), he states at one point the combined claims of the Arab air forces accounted for more aircraft than the Israel Air Force flew! He quotes an Egyptian Air Force officer who explained that the Israelis have more aircraft than anyone knows. Very interesting. I also want to mention that Mr. Nordeen has written not only a history of Israel's air force, but also a history of Egypt's air force called: \\"Phoenix over the Nile: A History of Egyptian Air Power 1932-1994.\\" I would also like to mention that my edition is the older 1985 printing and that a more up-to-date 2002 version has been published, but I haven't seen or read that edition. <br />At any rate, Mr. Londeen has done an excellent job of telling the rise of missile warfare without taking a strong bias for any side. He points out, from a very even keel, the strengths and weakness of the various combatants in major conflicts involving aerial warfare since the advent of the missile.<br />I highly recommend this very well written book for anyone wanting to learn more about the effect that the missile has had on military aviation.  <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan.	2003-04-24

What little that is published is either published in the Arabic language or is so highly suspect (propaganda) that it is of negligible factual value. That's one of the factors that makes Charles Stafrace's book \\"Arab Air Forces\\" so uniquely valuable. It is not only written in the English language, but Mr. Stafrace has kept his political viewpoint to a minimum making it tremendously easier to read than comparable resources in Arabic or translated from Arabic.<br />The book itself is grouped to give short concise histories of the air arms of various Arab nations as well as speculative numbers and types of aircraft used during Arab Air Forces' histories. The book was published in 1994 so don't expect information any more current than 1994 (However, this does include Desert Storm). I emphasize that the histories are short (typically four to six pages for most Arab air forces and less for smaller air arms) so don't expect very many details. What information is available appears to be mired in fact rather than guesswork. Mr. Stafrace hasn't referenced or footnoted his work in any way whatsoever. There is no bibliography either. I would assume his information comes from public media sources although there's no way to be sure short of contacting Mr. Stafrace.<br />I imagine that the reference would be of most use to plastic kit modelers although I found it tremendously useful as someone who studies the Arab-Israeli conflict. I personally bought the text as a reference before painting some models of Arab aircraft. In that respect, this book has been very useful.<br />Histories and details of the following Arab Air Forces are included: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen (Current nation comprised of both South and North Yemen), Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen), and Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).  <br />Perhaps the book's most attractive selling point are the numerous color and photo plates as well as the generous number of black and white photos interspersed throughout the text. Photos of Arab aircraft that aren't from a gun reticule are hard to come by and Mr. Stafrace has provided plenty of quality photographs in his book. <br />My biggest criticism of the book comes from the passages in which Mr. Stafrace has injected his political opinion. It is clear that he is, at the very least, moderately pro-Arab in his political thought. The chapter detailing the Egyptian Air Force shows a clear bias against the Israelis. The chapter about the Iraqis also shows a bias against the Iranians. I recommend consulting other books for better information about aerial combat between the Egyptians and Israelis or between the Iranians and the Iraqis.    <br />I highly recommend \\"Arab Air Forces\\" for those who desire to learn more about the Arab air forces.     <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-22

Everyone has heard of the mighty Roman Empire that nearly conquered the world and imposed its' rule wherever it went. What many people don't know that historians do is that Romans went to the Holy Land (Israel) and brutally subjugated its' people, the Jews. They destroyed Jerusalem, massacred entire villages of thousands as symbols of Roman power, and lined the roads of Israel with crucifixes on which corpses were cruelly hung. In the midst of this Roman killing, some people would not give up no matter the cost and Masada is their story.<br />Masada itself is the name of a fortress built in Northern Israel by king Herod and it was old before the time of Jesus (It was built sometime between 37 to 4 B.C.E.). When the Romans came to Israel, the Jews had mixed opinions about how to deal with the Roman Empire. Thought was split between quite a few groups. The basic differences were between people who welcomed the Roman Empire because of the prosperity it could possibly bring and those who condemned the Roman Empire for its' cultural depravity (Orgies, gladiatorial combat, sacrifice, etc.). Eventually the Romans made the decision easy by imposing crippling taxes on the people and religious oppression. This was the straw that broke the camels back and all the Jews no matter their political differences united. Unfortunately, their unification happened too late. The Romans destroyed Jerusalem and razed the Great Temple from the Bible. The survivors fled north to a fortress known as... Masada. <br />\\"Masada\\" the book by Ernest Gann, originally known by the title \\"The Antagonists,\\" tells the story of this small group of 960 Jews who defied the Roman Empire by refusing to give in to Roman demands. It tells the story of Elazer Ben Yair, leader of the Jews, and Flavius Silva, general of Rome's elite Tenth Legion. It tells the story of how Elazer and his small group decidedto commit suicide when it became apparent the Roman army would soon breach the walls of Masada. This mass suicide rocked the ancient world, and many peoples oppressed by the Roman Empire took heart in the symbol of a small people who never gave in. The alternative to giving in facing the fortress's defenders was hardly more attractive than death. Once the Romans defeated them, the men could expect to be sold off as slaves or crucified, and the women would be condemned to slavery and prostitution.<br />Much of the basis of the story is historical thanks to the saved accounts of a Jew turned traitor to Masada's defenders: Flavius Josephus. Josephus as he is better known wrote a history book known as \\"The Jewish War\\" that the Roman Emperor Vespasian had commissioned. As the adage goes, \\"victors write the history books,\\" and Vespasian commissioned Flavius to write a history book that extolled his accomplishments as Roman Emperor including the conquering of Masada. For the Romans, commissioning a person who had actually witnessed the history he was extolling was highly unusual. Most Roman history books were written by men who lived hundreds of years after the events being retold. \\"The Jewish Wars\\" tells the tale of the siege of Masada from the Roman's vantage, but includes details that, to this day, have been useful to archeologists exploring Masada's ruins. Ernest Gann used \\"The Jewish Wars\\" in addition to other references to write his historical fiction novel of the siege of Masada. <br />I recommend reading Yigal Yadin's (one of the archeologists who has explored Masada) book \\"Masada,\\" Flavius Josephus' \\"The Jewish Wars,\\" as well as trying to rent the 1981 ABC television series \\"Masada,\\" which starred Peter O'Toole. The screenplay of the 1981 ABC television series was made using \\"Masada\\" the novel by Ernest Gann. The television series was very well done and I enjoyed it very much.<br />I highly recommend the novel \\"Masada\\" or \\"The Antagonists\\" as it is also known. Itis a wonderful novel of fascinating historical fiction. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-16

The author, Petru Popescu, did an excellent job of researching his subject having consulted actual anthropologists. He obviously researched African politics and culture, as well, to make his characters believable. I also found it refreshing that many of the African characters were both positive and protagonists. <br />Some of the ideas about the development from primate to Homo Sapien in terms of social, physical, and emotional development were very intriguing. To give an example, I found the idea of early Neanderthals and different versions of humanity living concurrently and interbreeding to be fascinating. To think that we picked up, as modern humans, many successful traits from \\"evolutionary dead ends\\" such as the Neanderthals is really captivating. <br />The book itself is the story of one anthropologist, Ken Lauder, a Californian \\"beach bum\\" type hiding out from responsibility, in far off Kenya. In the course of his existence in Kenya, he makes a big discovery that could rock the anthropological world: a possible living \\"missing link.\\" Ken and his friend, a local African with connection, are in the process of exploring their discovery when a civil war breaks out in Kenya and everything turns into chaos. The better part of the text explores what the field of anthropology is like (according to a fiction writer who did some research), what life in Africa is like and particularly the volatile politics of small African nations, and Ken's erstwhile existence after being abandoned in the African wild. While Ken is abandoned in the wild, he is befriended by a protohuman that Ken nicknames \\"Long Toes.\\" Ken and \\"Long Toes\\" form a father/son relationship that forms the core of the book.<br />If no other reason, read this book for its easy way of introducing scientific ideas about the origin of Homo Sapiens and their evolution. This book is a way for people who are scared of science to find out how enjoyable science can be. Enjoy! <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-13

I am sometimes drawn into these conversations and what I find out the majority of the time is that the same people complaining have no idea how our government works or how to change it. These same people often feel that loudly complaining will solve their differences. Then I start asking these people questions about their knowledge of government like \\"Do you know who your congressman is?\\" or \\"Do you know how Congress works?\\" What I usually get back is dirty looks and incredulous attitudes. Then I explain how our democratic republic works and how they can put pressure on their appointed representatives. They're usually amazed and ask how I know such things.  <br />I explain that a little education (what most people receive, but don't retain in their high school civics classes) about our government, country, and the history of our country can go a long way. Even something as simple as realizing what the three branches of our government are is a useful first step. Reading the Constitution can be a good second step. Books like this one explain some of the basic facts about how our government in the USA works and how to participate in it (other than just voting). <br />Perhaps the most important part of learning about the government and history of the USA is that it's OK to be patriotic. Too many radical liberals (and a few wacko conservatives!) think that it's shameful to be patriot. It's not. The USA is a great country and has much to be proud of. While the USA isn't perfect and has made some mistakes as a country, I always think of the final factor in this country's greatness is the large numbers of people who \\"vote with their feet\\" and immigrate here. Some people are so desperate to get here from countries that don't take care of or providefor them that they are willing to illegally immigrate here. That's, perhaps, one of the most powerful statements that can be made about the USA.<br />I highly recommend this book for those of you who feel that your vote isn't important or that you can't change your world.

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Feel the Heat of the Sinai 1956	S.L.A. Marshall is probably best known for his book \\"Swift Sword,\\" which chronicled the 1967 \\"Six Day War\\" between the Israelis and the Arabs. However, he wrote extensively as a reporter, a foreign correspondent and a writer. Among the best of his many books is \\"Sinai Victory,\\" which chronicles the complicated 1956 Suez War (often also called The One Hundred Hour War) between Egypt and Israel with France, the UK, and others. Marshall focuses on the combat between the Egyptians and Israelis on the Sinai Peninsula.<br />Marshall traveled to Israel and spent time with the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) at training, peacetime, and then war in 1956. His accounts are authentic and actual observations. Being a Western reporter at one time an official US Army reporter, Marshall has some very revealing and lucid observations of the Israeli army. He was given very free reign to interview Israeli commanders, troops, and others to make his determination how an inferior outnumbered Israeli army could defeat the massive forces of a nation like Egypt in so short a period of time. His comments on training and operational techniques are an excellent case study of desert warfare and still hold lessons for today's militaries in the Middle East (including the US and UK militaries in Iraq 2003).  <br />The book is a hardback edition and features no photographs other than those on the dust jacket. However, Marshall included many hand drawn maps and illustrations inside, which are extremely cogent. Some of the information I have found in no other reference and is uniquely valuable. The three appendices cover training in the IDF, the air battle in 1956, and an outline and chronology of the war as well as an extremely useful index.  <br />A small side note that I highly appreciated regards \\"Parker's Memorial,\\" a large monument, which marks the Mitla Pass. It is actually a monument to Col. A.C. Palmer, DSO, and a British officer from earlier times. However, it was erroneously called \\"Parker's Memorial\\" so many times that the name has remained in most histories of the area.   <br />While \\"Sinai Victory\\" is nonfiction and fact, I also highly recommend the historical fiction novel \\"Mitla Pass\\" by Leon Uris for more background on the 1956 Suez War. <br />This book is an outstanding reference to anyone studying the 1956 Suez War. Its' information would be useful to historians, wargamers, and anyone else interested in the topic. <BR>  <BR>I highly recommend \\"Sinai Victory\\" to anyone wanting to learn more about the 1956 Suez War.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-06

The book uses another title for the conflict: The Palestine War of 1948, which is preferred in some British academic circles. Efraim Karsh is an Israeli academic working in the United Kingdom. He has extensively written covering different aspects of Israel and the Arab-Israeli conflict.<br />The book is a concise (92 page) study of the conflict covering the rising paramilitary action before the British withdrawal until the eventual ceasefires declared between Israel and the Arab invaders. There is some analysis also of the Palestinian-Arab refugee issue as well as early Arab and Jewish state building. The real jewels of the book, of course, are its' many beautiful photographs, gorgeous illustrations, and helpful maps and graphs. A very useful timeline or chronology is also included. Karsh does include a bibliography, but doesn't use footnotes to reference his writing. His bibliography includes a wide variety of authors including Arabs, Israelis, anti-Zionists, and Zionists: Musa Alami, Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, Chaim Herzog, Efraim Karsh, Issa Khalaf, Rashid Khalidi, Walid Khalidi, Jon and David Kimche, Dan Kurzman, Walter Laqueur, and Natanel Lorch.   <br />Another of the book's attractive aspects is that the book includes some oft forgotten details of the war. Some of these details include the fact that the people we now call Palestinians identified themselves as parts of a greater Arab nation rather than an individual people seeking individual sovereignty. Neither does Karsh forgot to include that the Jews have had a continuous presence in Israel for thousands of years. Many writers gloss over this fact and call the Israelis colonists, settlers, or foreign peoples. They are not. Israel is their home and has been for thousands of years. Karsh also writes about the early connections between the Nazis and the Arabs in Israel / Palestine. <br />I highly recommend this book as an excellent introductory volume to the 1948 War for Israeli Independence.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-05

Piers Anthony is best known for his popular fantasy / comedy series Xanth, but before he became bogged down in the puns of Xanth, he wrote some great science fiction and fantasy of world class. \\"Prostho Plus\\" is one of those really great books.<br />What sets this book apart in the spirit of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is that the protagonist is an unlikely dentist catapulted off terrestrial Earth into the highly dangerous field of intergalactic dentistry. Dr. Dillingham, the human dentist, is propelled from alien mouth to alien mouth performing badly needed procedures for xenoforms in pain. The book is hilarious and Anthony's ideas about alien mouths are both interesting and innovative. <br />I highly recommend this very amusing and well-written novel!<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-05

I'm in the education field and one of my reoccurring irritations is that when I go to conferences, I constantly hear about how ...racist, \\"fill-in-the-blank-with-evil-adjective\\" the government of the United States is. I am sometimes drawn into these conversations and what I find out the majority of the time is that the same people complaining have no idea how our government works or how to change it. These same people often feel that loudly complaining will solve their differences. Then I start asking these people questions about their knowledge of government like \\"Do you know who your congressman is?\\" or \\"Do you know how Congress works?\\" What I usually get back is dirty looks and incredulous attitudes. Then I explain how our democratic republic works and how they can put pressure on their appointed representatives. They're usually amazed and ask how I know such things.  <br />I explain that a little education (what most people receive, but don't retain in their high school civics classes) about our government, country, and the history of our country can go a long way. Even something as simple as realizing what the three branches of our government are is a useful first step. Reading the Constitution can be a good second step. Books like this one explain some of the basic facts about how our government in the USA works and how to participate in it (other than just voting). <br />Perhaps the most important part of learning about the government and history of the USA is that it's OK to be patriotic. Too many radical liberals (and a few wacko conservatives!) think that it's shameful to be patriot. It's not. The USA is a great country and has much to be proud of. While the USA isn't perfect and has made some mistakes as a country, I always think of the final factor in this country's greatness is the large numbers of people who \\"vote with their feet\\" and immigrate here. Some people are so desperate to get here from countries that don't take care of or provide for them that they are willing to illegally immigrate here. That's, perhaps, one of the most powerful statements that can be made about the USA.<br />I highly recommend this book for those of you who feel that your vote isn't important or that you can't change your world. You can!<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-04-05

Of course, such novels are better read in their native language, but for those of us who don't read Russian (I fortunately do!), this novel may be one of the only English-language translations available and, as such, is a great boon. <br />Valentin Rasputin has been called one of the most important voices of the post-Stalin era of Soviet literature. Indeed, it has been compared to Solzhenitsyn's masterpieces \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch\\" and \\"Matyora's Home.\\" One of Rasputin's shining graces is that he openly exposes the inward charms of Russian character and culture.<br />The story itself is about the destruction of a village to make way for a Soviet hydroelectric dam project. The dynamics between the older and younger members of the village and their feelings about their imminent departure from a place that has been home to them their whole lives forms the central conflict and interest of the novel. At the same time, the author reveals some of the deep-seated values about the relationship between man and nature that are key to Russian culture. <br />The blurbs on the back of the novel had a statement that I wanted to share:<br />\\"A haunting story with a heartfelt theme, `Farwell to Matyora' is a passionate plea for humanity and an eloquent cry for a return to an organic life.\\"<br />My strongest criticism of the novel is that the translator in many places seemed to come up short with ways to adequately portray the nuance and charm that are some of Rasputin's strongest charms in his native Russian. In many places the English translation did a very poor job of conveying the Russian meaning. I compared the Russian original to the English translation several times throughout the novel. I feel that the translator simply wasn't up to the task although I certainly don't think I could do a better one. Translation is an art and, at that, a fickle one.<br />One of my favorite little phrases that the translator decided to keep was \\"Japanese Gods,\\" which is a euphemism for cursing in Russian that a charming old codger of a character frequently repeats in his efforts to keep from actually cursing around another character that he considers is a \\"lady.\\"  <br />Read \\"Farewell to Matyora\\" because it's a charming novel for a lover of Russian literature.

Several outstanding books exist for the fighting on the Golan at the Syrian front and I highly recommend the books by Avigdor Kahalani and Raful Eitan. For a general overview of the war including both fronts, I recommend Chaim Herzog's \\"The War for Atonement.\\" However, \\"On the Banks of the Suez\\" has no equal for explaining the action on the Egyptian front.<br />Some of the many reasons that make this a great book are:<br />1. PROFESSIONAL MILITARY WRITING: A military professional wrote this book for other military professionals. Many authors have a tendency to remove military language and viewpoints to simplify the text for popular review. Bren Adan resisted doing that although he did write the book in as lucid and clear a method as is possible without \\"dumbing down\\" the work.<br />2. IMPARTIAL CRITICISM: The book, while written by an Israeli general, is impartial. He doesn't hesitate to critique the fighting by either the Egyptians or the Israelis. In fact, he criticizes the Israeli actions much more so than those of the Egyptians combatants. There, of course, are some of his personal opinions and some discussions of the political factors, but Adan avoids overly moralizing history and instead presents it for the reader's review.<br />3. LITTLE TO NO INTELLIGENCE \\"BLUR\\": One of the shortcomings of many books written about the 1973 Yom Kippur war in the first five to ten years after the war is the editing that IDF spokespeople did to the information released about the war. For security's sake, they often change unit names and other critical date making it difficult to track whom was where and when. Adan,being intimately aware of such restrictions, was able to write this book without having his writing made confusing.       <br />4. EXCITING ACCOUNTS OF THE ACTION: Adan holds no punches describing the action and successes of the fighters on both sides. I particularly enjoyed his accounts of the tough fighting by Egyptians commandos in the beginning of the war. The Israeli tankers, on the other hand, were tenacious dedicated fighters as well.<br />5. INSIGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF NONCOMBAT FACTORS: Adan describes very well what's is going on in the background of the war: the superpower struggle, ineffective UN mediation, political factors in both the Egyptian and Israeli government, as well as the effect of the civilians behind the lines. <br />I highly recommend this incredibly well written book to anyone interested in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. I particularly recommend it to military professionals.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-03-30

Sylvester gets very excited after finding out by trial and error in a very childlike way that his latest pebble grants wishes.

What you get is a reference for mythology that goes beyond the Greek / Roman gods and includes background on the pantheons of many culture's mythologies. This isn't just uncommon, but rare. <br />Most people when they hear the word mythology think of the Greek and Roman gods without realizing that almost every cultural group in the world has its own mythology. While I want to emphasize that this is a reference book and doesn't have huge comprehensive entries on each mythology, it's a great starting point for study of mythology. The excellent index and appendices makes it easy to find a name and look it up. There are also family trees, lists of gods and consorts, lists of areas of influence, and other useful information. I also want to mention that while the focus of mythology is on gods and goddesses, fantastic monsters, heroes, and others worthy of inclusion into a mythology are included.<br />Specifically, entries come from the following cultures: universal myths, pantheons, Greece and Rome, Mesopotamia (Babylon, Sumer, Akkad, etc.), Egypt, India, Gaul, the Celts, the Nordics (usually called the Norse Gods), the Slavs, pre-Columbian America (Aztec, Toltec, etc.), China, Japan, Pacific Islands (Polynesia), Africa and Madagascar, the Judeo-Christian World, and mythological creatures from different civilizations. <br />While I would certainly recommend Bullfinch or Edith Hamilton for larger volumes, as a small reference, this book has no equal. It is extremely handy and no other mythology reference I've found so far can cover so many cultures so well. Even the introduction is well written. While I like it very much, the level of writing is very academic and at a university level so that it might not make a good gift for a young teen unless they were a very strong reader. For younger readers, I would recommend the D'aulaire's books about Greek and Roman or Norse mythology asmore appropriate gifts. <br />I highly recommend this fine book. It is a superior mythology reference.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-03-29

Unlike what amounted to a relatively easy fight for the Imperius Dictatio's crew against the Orks, the Tyranids put up a tough fight and many of Imperius Dictatio's brother titans are destroyed. One, in fact, is captured, which leads to some of the graphic novel's more interesting plot directions. The other very interesting plot detail is the entry of the Eldar as an ally force. I very much enjoyed the way that the writers and illustrators of the Eldar portrayed them. They truly seem alien and imposing rather than simply anthropomorphic copies of human beings. <br />All in all, \\"Titan II: Vivaporius\\" was a very enjoyable read and a far superior piece of art and writing than its' predecessor. <br />I highly recommend \\"Titan II: Vivaporius.\\"<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-03-26

All of the combat in this novel faces Ork opponents. <br />The greatest attraction is to see the fine artwork of the novel. The titans are fleshed out with every nut and bolt. The pilots and crew of a Titan are defined to great satisfaction for the 40k enthusiast. I bought my novel to give me ideas how to convert 6mm scale Epic titans. \\"Titan - the Graphic Novel\\" was well worth my money for that reason alone. However, I don't think the story could stand well on its' own if it didn't already have an established fan base of 40k players.<br />I recommend this graphic novel for the GW 40k enthusiast and fan.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan.	2003-03-25

I read quite a few novels every year about Semitic subjects, the Arab World, Israel, Islam, Judaism, etc. and this one of the novels that I picked up at a used book store. To put it quite simply, I now understand why the novel was used before I purchased it. This novel is extremely poorly written and I highly recommend NOT EVER reading it!<br />Dana Adams Schmidt of The New York Times wrote this spindly paperback back in 1974 and the books rear blurb states:<br />\\"Collectively, THE NEW YORK TIMES SURVEY SERIES is designed to better inform the American people of what is happening around the world today, what underlies our present problems, and what can and should be done about them. These practical `background' books are especially appropriate for busy people - students, professional and business people - who need to know and understand more about the great, relevant issues of the day.\\"<br />The back blurb sounded good so I took a chance and bought this book. From the very beginning of the novel, I began to have my doubts as the author established her credibility in the first chapter of the novel entitled \\"A Personal Note.\\" Mrs. Schmidt went on to explain that she was a reporter in Europe during the Holocaust and later uses that experience to justify repeating Yassir Arafat's rhetoric, which she quotes constantly in the novel. She literally spent time interviewing Yassir Arafat as a reporter stationed in Israel. Apparently, she must have developed some sort of romantic affection for Yassir Arafat, because she spends much of the rest of the novel pining for him. Here's an example directly quoted from pages 153-154:<br />-<br />\\"Looking back on his formative years, in an interview in Amman in October, 1968, Arafat observed that `Since I opened my eyes to this world, I was able to hear the sound of bullets.\\" It is likely that as a boy the future commando leader heard about the exploits against the British - and the Arabs - of the Jewish paramilitary groups, Haganah, Irgun, Stern. It would have been natural for him to yearn to do likewise, or better, with the Arabs against the Jews.\\"<br />\\"'Of course,' he said, `I joined the fighting of 1948 just as thousands of my brethren ... because we believed it was a fight to defend our existence and the existence of the Arab people.' The interview took place in one of the small, bare rooms of the headquarters Fatah was using at that time in a stone village on Jebel Luwebdeh, a few hundred yards from the American Embassy. He sat at a small wooden desk, the afternoon sun shining upon him.\\"<br />\\"As he grew accustomed to his visitor he seemed to relax, and removed the heavy dark glasses which had become his trademark. With his large, brown eyes, he gazed searchingly at the visitor. He spoke quietly, even gently. For a man who has spent much of his life `underground,' his manner with strangers is not easy at first. He conveyed a quality of sweetness. As I pressed him for the personal side of his story, he smiled broadly showing his full, sensitive lips and regular teeth. He wore a heavy, brown sweater in the chilly atmosphere of the stone house, a tattered red-covered notebook in his left breast pocket visible above the edge of the sweater. His trousers were of the wooly British battledress type, his boots black and heavy. He spoke Arabic, through an interpreter most of the time, although his English is good.\\"<br />-<br />As you can imagine, I was about ready to gag after reading the above quoted passage. It's not even good writing by the standards of a Harlequin romance novel let alone a novel about politics and international relations. Much of the novel is characterized by a gaudy romantic approach to the PLO's (Palestinian Liberation Organization, a terrorist group that became well known for killing innocents and blowing up aircraft) approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Of all the novels I have read about the Middle East, this is, rock bottom, the very worst! Don't read this novel if you want to LEARN anything factual about the Middle East.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-03-25

The core of the novel is about a successful business man, Dave Dehn, that attempts to start a housing tract complete with a synagogue/temple catering to Jewish families who agree to raise their children as Bar and Bat Mitzvahs. It's an interesting concept. Here's the catch, Dave plans to build his community right in the middle of a highly anti-Semitic East Coast neighborhood. That neighborhood is in the middle of a small town complete with a town council resistant to change, an exclusive country club, and a nasty \\"Ol' Boy's\\" network. Add in a little sex, a murder, a suicide or two, and that's where I get my impression of the novel as an expanded soap opera story.<br />The novel was a slow starter, but once I got over the initial \\"hump,\\" it was all down hill and I enjoyed the novel although I'm still only rating it a three out of five because of its' slow start, soap opera nonsense, and its' failure to come through on the murder until late in the novel.<br />[...] <br />Considering that the book was given to me as a gift by a friend who knows I have an interest in the Hebrew Temples from ancient times (and still being fought over to the present day), I consider the book an OK read. It really had nothing to do with the ancient Hebrew Temples, but it did have an interesting W.W.II / Holocaust tie-in. Where, after all, did all of the Third Reich's gold go? The book proposes an interesting theory to answering this question.<br />I don't recommend this book except as a passing entertainment. There are much better books available to read.<br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-03-17

Let me emphasize that all of the characters in the Haj are the complete creation of the author, and entirely fictional. The exceptions, of course, are the recognizable public figures who were associated historically with this period, such as David Ben-Gurion, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Abdullah, Yigal Allon, and others.\\"<br />There is no question that this book is fiction regarding the details its' story tells, but the story itself is a real one. Arab refugees did stream out of Israel during the 1948 war and Arab leaders telling them to do so (there are taped broadcasts of these calls) was definitely one of the major causes of the plight of the Palestinian-Arab refugees. There was also very definitely a very active terrorist movement among the Arabs in the Middle East, which survives to the present day (witness groups like Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hizbollah, the PLO / Palestinian authority, and others). The Palestinian-Arabs continue to suffer under poor leadership that represses their rights (witness many human rights organizations' reports of extrajudicial killings by the Palestinian Authority, the same autocratic leader, Yassir Arafat, who refuses to transfer the reins of power, and other facts). It is also a well-documented fact that the Mufti of Jerusalem was an ally and guest of Hitler during WWII. These things are facts and are indisputable. \\"The Haj\\" tells a story using the device of historical fiction to relay the often-ugly facts of life for the regular \\"fellah\\" (sometimes translated as peasant) in the land the British called Palestine and is now known again as Israel.  <br />The book is well written (good grammar, punctuation, style, etc.) and the story flows. I enjoyed reading about the characters of the story, but often wanted to cry for them. Some of the most poignant moments of \\"The Haj\\" occur during the flight of the Haj's (the main character is Haj Ibrahim and the book is the story of him and his family) family during the 1948 war and in refugee camps in Jordan. It was very sad to see how members of the same culture (the Arab culture) and most of the time the same religion (Islam) can be so cruel to each other. This is still an endemic problem in the Arab world (witness how the Arab governments squabble among each other and often fight and kill one another). Some of the depictions of the relations between the largely city-dwelling Palestinian-Arabs and the nomadic Bedouin are among the saddest. There is still a strong hatred between these groups to the present day.  <br />Why read \\"The Haj?\\"<br />Read \\"The Haj\\" because this is real information presented in a novel format that you can no longer get from most university classes about the Middle East. Read it to learn what AP and Reuters news services constantly gloss over in their writings used by newspapers around the world. Most of all, read \\"The Haj\\" to understand that one of the fundamental truths about problems in the Middle East is that the problems have less to do with Israel and Jews than cultural, political, and even religious problems and divisions in the Arab world.

Luckily for many of my ESL (English as a Second Language) students, the captions were brief enough for many of my students with developing English skills.

That being said, I enjoyed reading the novel and would recommend it to others. I gave it four stars rather than five because of the many places it dragged due to superfluous detail or rote recitation of detail.<br />ABOUT THE CONTENT: I enjoy reading about W.W.II when I get the chance, but I mostly review books about the Arab-Israeli Wars. This book, however, has a very interesting tie-in: many of Israel's soldiers were SURVIVORS of Stalingrad (On the Soviet side, of course!). William Craig didn't ignore the Jewish tie-in to The Battle of Stalingrad. His research includes interviews of several Israelis who were soldiers, Russian or Polish nationals, and survivors of Stalingrad. Among them were: Ignacy Changar, Mikhail Goldstein, and Hersch Gurewicz.<br />The book in most places flows very well. Craig accomplishes this by interspersing personal accounts from the war from the hundreds of interviews that he performed over five plus years in several countries including Russia, Germany, and Israel. Hearing the personal accounts of an Italian doctor on march as a prisoner of the Red Army really gives the book some human interest. Reading of how this same doctor would regale his fellow prisoners with stories about delicious meals in Italy, while the prisoners were surviving on a few frozen cabbages and hunks of bread (not enough to sustain human life and well below minimum caloric needs) was very colorful. Craig also didn't ignore some of the more gruesome aspects of captivity under the Red Army: cannibalism. Many of the Italians and other prisoners of the Red Army during W.W.II were treated so poorly and were so desperately hungry that they resorted to cannibalism. Pretty gruesome, but very entertaining. Very few soldiers left the Red Army camps. Of the estimated 90,000 Axis troops (Italian,Hungarian, German, etc.) who eventually surrendered and went into captivity less than 5,000 of them were able to return to see their countries and families again (and the great majority of them, only after twelve years in tortuous captivity as described above). In this respect, the novel reminded me of \\"One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovitch\\" or the \\"Archipelago Gulag\\" books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. <br />The military history was commendable and presented details such as the significance of the battle, the major personalities and the battlefield butchery that have made this battle a thing of legend. However, Orders of Battles (OOB) or TO&E (Tables of Organization and Equipment) are not included in the novel. While this may be a disappointment to many wargamers, the colorful accounts of many battles would be very inspirational to scenario writers. One of the most interesting tributes to this book is that it spawned an entire game that is well known to W.W.II gamers: ASL (Advanced Squad Leader).<br />BEST THING ABOUT THE NOVEL: The author's many interviews with actual survivors and the use of those same survivor's personal diaries is without a doubt this book's greatest strength. The wide range of narratives from German, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian soldiers, support staff, commanders, and civilians gives this book its' considerable realism and entertaining strength. Even better, William Craig didn't leave the story unfinished; he wrote a short epilogue that tells about many of the characters as they survived the war as of 1973 (when the book was first published). For the film's fans, it was interesting that Tanya Chernova (the femme fatale) didn't end up marrying Zaitsev (the protagonist) after the war. She thought that Zaitsev had died and didn't learn until 1969 that he had both survived the war and married someone else. It's really hard not to like a novel that has such facts!<br />ABOUT THE TIE-IN TO THE MOVIE:  My edition of the book was the movie tie-inversion and I view those words with dubiousness since the film's main characters occupy about 6 pages of this 455-page book. The movie focused on the micro drama of two snipers battling, but the book focuses on the ENTIRE conflict from the moment German troops entered Soviet soil until the defeat of German General Paulus at Stalingrad. Many believe that \\"Enemy at the Gates,\\" the movie, is more closely based on the fictional novel \\"The War of the Rats\\" (which in turn uses this book for a lot of its information). I agree with this conclusion. Another reviewer wrote:<br />\\"If you want to be educated, read Craig's book. If you want to be educated AND enthralled, read David Robbins' WAR OF THE RATS instead.\\" <br />I like the spirit of his words, but disagree with the idea that \\"War of the Rats\\" by David Robbins is educational and entertaining. While very entertaining and educational in that it uses William Craig's book as a source, the book would include a caption \\"based on fact\\" if it were made into a movie today (curiously enough like the film \\"Enemy at the Gates\\"). Robbins is a better writer in that his prose is much more entertaining, but his research wouldn't light a candle to that of William Craig. I would recommend reading both novels: \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" by William Craig for the facts and \\"War of the Rats\\" by David Robbins for entertainment.     <BR> <BR>SUGGESTIONS: I would also suggest seeing the movie \\"Stalingrad\\" directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. This German-produced film follows the story of  \\"Enemy at the Gates: Movie Tie-In\\" much better. The film does a better job of showing the horrific face of the battle than \\"Enemy at the Gates.\\"<br />I also recommend the film \\"Europa Europa\\" for an account of Solomon Perel, a Jewish-German boy who manages to conceal his identity from the Nazis and ends up a member of their Youth Party as well as a soldier in the W.W.II German army. The movie is based on Solomon Perel's autobiography, also a good read.<br />REVIEW BY: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-02-03

That being said, I enjoyed reading the novel and would recommend it to others. I gave it four stars rather than five because of the many places it dragged due to superfluous detail or rote recitation of detail.<br />ABOUT THE CONTENT: I enjoy reading about W.W.II when I get the chance, but I mostly review books about the Arab-Israeli Wars. This book, however, has a very interesting tie-in: many of Israel's soldiers were SURVIVORS of Stalingrad (On the Soviet side, of course!). William Craig didn't ignore the Jewish tie-in to The Battle of Stalingrad. His research includes interviews of several Israelis who were soldiers, Russian or Polish nationals, and survivors of Stalingrad. Among them were: Ignacy Changar, Mikhail Goldstein, and Hersch Gurewicz.<br />The book in most places flows very well.

US	49197174	RTBHXJ8NQ0TMC	0809015048	113107693	Operation Peace for Galilee: The Israeli-Plo War in Lebanon	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Great Account of the 1982 Lebanon War	If you are looking for a politically-skewed analysis of the Arab-Israeli conflict or an overly biased account of the war, this is not your book. I say overly biased because all author have an opinion that is expressed overtly or covertly in their writing. <br />Richard A. Gabriel, a well-respected professor of politics at St. Anselm College, former US Army intelligence officer, and consultant to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees as well as the Pentagon, has written what is probable the most objective and well-written account of the 1982 War in Lebanon between Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, PLO, and other forces. He has written numerous books about military actions including several books that constructively criticized the American actions in Vietnam. Several of his books have since become requred reading for courses at military academies.<br />Prof. Gabriel went out of his way to write an objective analysis of the combat, going so far as to interview PLO officials, IDF soldiers, and others. He also toured the battefields as they occurred as a guest of the IDF. Even more to his credit, he made a stipulation of his touring the front with the IDF that IDF miltary censors not be able to review his transcripts at all until after publishing. This means that he was able to effectively write whatever he wanted.<br />The book itself is brilliant. Within its' 242 pages are numerous analyses of various tactical and strategic conflicts of the 1982 War. He lists grievances and events of all sides into the war and yet hesitates to make value judgements about any of them short of miltary stance. While avoidings making the book a massive judgement of the political stance of any of the fighters, he doesn't hesitate to list political factors that the combatants considered at the time of the war.<br />One of the greatest treasures of having toured Lebanon and the conditions there is that he was able to disprove many of the false accounts that the media of the time forwarded to the public. Being a meticulous researcher also means that he always quotes sources and provides appropriate background. For instance, the PLO (through the Lebanese newspaper \\"An Nahar\\")claimed that Israeli forces killed 17,825 civilian noncombatants killed and wounded 30,103 civilians. Mr. Gabriel analyzed all of the data available from various sources (including interviews with village mayors and other on-the-site witnesses) and came up with a more likely figure of 4,000 to 5,000 killed and 12,000 to 14,000 wounded.<br />If you are looking for an account of the 1982 war that objectively evaluates military actions of the combatants then Prof. Richard A. Gabriel's \\"Operation Peace for Galilee - The Israeli-PLO War in Lebanon\\" is unparallelled. I highly recommend reading this book whether you are looking for more background on the Arab-Israeli conflict, are a military historian, a wargamer, or just someone interested in knowing more about the Middle-East. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan	2003-01-28

Ahmed Jibril AKA Abu Jihad (Father Holy War) is a name that is well known to members of anti-terrorist units around the world. Jibril is (maybe was) a master terrorist who helped to pioneer the use of air jacking (taking planes and their passengers hostage), bombing of airliners, killing of innocents, and a host of other crimes. <br />This book tells his story from what little is known of his formative years until his disappearance from the world scene around the early 1990's (It is thought that either the Syrians are hiding him or that he might have died from a heart attack.). Simply put, this man is a monster and it's frightening that people like him exist. He is responsible for the deaths of around 600 to 700 people from a myriad of nations (most of the people were killed from bombing airliners including the 270 people who perished on Pan Am Flight 103 which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland). He pioneered the use of explosives on planes (using barometric triggers i.e. they sense altitude and pressure). Some of the scariest attacks include taking school children hostage in Israel and killing eleven of them and three of their teachers.<br />This book is a nonstop thriller recounting Jibril's moves, as they are known and countermoves from various forces trying to stop him. I recommend it to those interested in learning more about terrorism, political movements in the Middle East, counterterrorism methods, or simply a glimpse into the mind of a madman.  <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan.	2003-01-16
US	49197174	R3AS0QA3YY5VGU	0452011248	143462375	Treblinka	Books	5	11	12	N	N	History of Inhumanity and Hope in the Face of Utter Evil	\\"Treblinka\\" is a powerful novel and a story of things that the Nazis wanted the world to never know. The novel spares nothing in the telling: every gruesome beating, coldhearted murder, inhuman cruelty is captured in shocking detail. I wanted to shed tears as I read this novel. There were so many poignant moments that made me breathless and contemplative of such a world.<br />However, in the face of the Holocaust (Shoah) the real treasure are how these human slaves kept their humanity... making jokes in the face of genocide. One might think that it would be impossible to laugh when people are being thrown into ovens and turned into consumer goods for the Third Reich (human hair for pillows, rendering people into soap, some things even worse), but the downtrodden victims of Treblinka never gave up. They kept faith in life and living life (not just surviving) in the face of the most horrible death.<br />I read about some of the humor of these condemned and it is a miracle in and of itself (Pg.238 \\"Treblinka,\\" 1967 Simon and Shuster Hardcover Edition):<br />------------<br />\\"Earlier, at the end of the ghetto period, when the best will in the world it had become impossible to preserve the slightest hope, some Jews had taken refuge in humor. The essential metaphysical question had become: \\"Do you believe in life after the trains?\\" The standard consolation to friends to whom you had to leave and whose sadness could be read on their faces had become, \\"\\"Come on, cheer up, old man, we'll meet again some day in a better world - in a shop window as soap.\\" If the friend was in the know, he was supposed to reply, \\"Yes, but while from my fat they'll make toilet soap, you'll be a bar of cheap laundry soap.\\"<br />\\"To understand this humor is to understand the infinite love of life of the Jews. It is to understand both the abdication and the miracle.\\" <br />-------------<br />The book also functions as a history of how the \\"death camp\\" evolved in the Baltics from gun killings to Xyklon-B (poison gas) vans to the concentration camps that the Holocaust is better known for. Particularly discussed are the machinations of the SS and the \\"Technicians\\" to dehumanize the Jews and not only make them captives and victims, but willing accomplices in the process of committing genocide. The novel examines what it means to live while everyone around you dies (often including one's own family and children). The moral burden of such a situation is even difficult to just ponder yet alone have to survive.<br />Another function of the novel is to disprove the myth of the concentration camp Jew as a meek helpless being to be pitied. The surviving Jews at Treblinka did stage a revolt and out of the eight hundred Jews (themselves the survivors of around eight-hundred-thousand Jews that the Nazis \\"processed\\" at the Treblinka) that the Nazis kept as menial labor at Treblinka, forty survived the war. Their testimonies in addition to the few books written about the subject after the war form the bulk of the research sources of \\"Treblinka.\\"  <br />Sometimes this book is criticized for being \\"fiction\\" since it isn't referenced like as academic tome (footnotes, bibliography, etc.), but the author is careful to explain in her introduction and the conclusion that apart from the survivors' testimonies and what little physical evidence could be found, there was little concrete evidence to be had. The Nazis were careful to destroy written records and even incinerated the bodies of their victims in an effort to hide this atrocity. I found the story to be very convincing and don't doubt the author's writing one iota.<br />Probably the biggest reason to read \\"Treblinka\\" is that it's so very readable. Reading about the Holocaust can be an emotionally taxing task, but thanks to the author's easy-to-read and captivating style as well as a focus on the hope that sustained the survivors of Treblinka, \\"Treblinka\\" is an easy and enjoyable read. Out of all the novels that I've read about the Holocaust I've read, I would now recommend \\"Treblinka\\" to start a study of the Holocaust. Highly recommended.	2002-12-10
US	49197174	R36DFD2JICD6UI	1561710156	115964706	Politics, Lies and Videotape: 3,000 Questions and Answers on the Mideast Crisis	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Debunking Myths of the Middle East	What Yitschak Ben Gad has done in this 1991 book is debunk many of the more common myths of the Middle East in an easy-to-read Q&A (Questions and Answers) form accompanied by many references, quotes, source documents, and political cartoons. <br />The book is extremely well documented and the political cartoons come from many sources including Dry Bones (a popular cartoon in many syndicated papers in Israel), Sawt-El-Arab (an Egyptian daily newspaper), El-Shaab (another Egyptian daily newspaper), Al-Nadwa (A Saudi Arabian newspaper), Achbar Al-Chaleege (a Bahrainian newspaper), and from many other publications around the world. Many of the pages include the original Arabic, Hebrew, or other-language documents that Ban Gad uses for references. If you read Arabic then this book is an extremely good source for political commentary in the Arabic language (a huge variety of pages from newspapers around the Arab world are featured in the original Arabic). Because of the unadulterated nature of political cartoons and unambiguous statements from Arabic media sources, the book in many places reads like a history of anti-Semitism.<br />Books like this helped to lead to Internet groups like MEMRI.org that translate Arabic newspapers and other media into English for anyone interested (mostly for politicians, professors, etc.).   <br />I found the cartoons to be very powerful indicators of political opinion in the Middle East since standards of decency are very different in the Arab world and Israel. For instance many of the cartoons from Arab newspapers show horrific depictions of bloody hands, dismembered bodies, racist caricatures (hook-nosed Jews, swastikas, Nazi references, etc.), and every kind of desecration of the Star of David or the Menorah (symbols of Judaism and Israel) that might be possible. The Israeli political cartoons featured in this book have great sarcasm and irony, but feature none of the horrific images that are commonplace in the majority of newspapers inthe Arab world.<br />One of my criticisms of the book is that while it features many wonderful and authentic source documents, it is all in black and white format, which in many places makes the source materials very difficult to read. Some of the photographs are very difficult to make out in black and white format. However, I found this shortcoming manageable and not overwhelming.          <br />Here's what Yitschak Ben Gad wrote about the book (page xviii):<br /><<<< This book is based on a great collection of material from different sources in a number of languages, and especially from the material of the Israeli Foreign office and PLO publications (see detailed list in the bibliography at the end of the book). The approach of the book is unique. It is composed of thousands of short questions, answers, comments, and quotations from various sources dealing with subjects concerning the Middle East. This is not meant to be a history book.<br />The goal is to enable the average reader, who may show some interest in our troubled area, to get an idea about most of the subjects without having to strive or read at great length. The questions and subjects are based upon my selective and subjective discretion. I have no intention of dealing with all aspects of the conflict. The idea is to deal with either forgotten issues or with subjects that demonstrate the absurdity of the conflict and the great injustice inflicted upon the Jewish people. The quotations are meant to strengthen the points dealt with in each chapter...<br />Last but not least, I hope this book will help to put history in its proper perspective. I believe that only when the facts are known will the chances for peace in our troubled area, based upon justice, be enhanced. Our prophet, Zachariah, said: \\"You should love truth and peace.\\" This comes to show that truth precedes peace. >>>>     <br />This book is very similar to others of its kind including \\"Battleground: Fact & Fantasy in Palestine\\" <BR>by Samuel Katz, \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict (2nd Edition)\\" by Mitchell G. Bard, \\"Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923\\" by Efraim Karsh, \\"Myths and Facts: A Guide to the Arab-Israeli Conflict\\" by Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, and others. It works well on its' own or as a complementary volume to any or all of the above book titles.  <br />I highly recommend this book as an excellent way to quickly learn about the Middle East and many of its myths.	2002-11-23

Mr. Berkman is also known for his careers as a newspaperman, screenplay writer, composer, and United Nations official.<br />This novel is part of Mr. Berkman's interest in Israel and how this little country has managed to militarily overcome the numerically superior armies of several Arab states so many times. This book, in particular, focusses on revealing the human stories of several Israelis before and during the Six Day War of 1967 (In the Arab world this conflict is often called the June War).<br />He tells the stories of:<BR>1. Major Avihu: A sabra (native-born) Israeli pilot in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) who played an important part of the preemptive strike that destroyed the Arab air forces.<BR>2. David \\"Dudu\\" Sela: Another sabra and a  world-class celloist and mechanized infantry commander.  <BR>3. Robert Szereszevski: A PhD professor with an interest in African economics and development born in Warsaw, Poland who survived the Holocaust. Robert was physically unable to join the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) but, none-the-less, managed to join an Israeli infantry force that helped retake the city of Jerusulem.<BR>4. Colonel Mordecai \\"Motta\\" Gur: A sabra farmer, family man, and kibbutznik who led the armies that retook Jerusalem.<BR>5. Naftali Cohen: A Jewish exhile from the Arab countries who became an infantryman famed for his bravery at the militarily significant battle at Ammunition Hill.<BR>6. Esther Arditi Zalinger: An Italian-born Jewish nurse whose journey to Israel and fearless dedication to saving lives led her to venture into live fire. She managed to save many lives including those of several of the enemy Arab's soldiers (and a few friendly Arabs as well).<BR>7. Yaacov Basil: A Yemeni Jew tankist and an example of perserverance inthe face of difficulty.<BR>8. Many others....<br />Mr. Berkman obviously did an impressive amount of research into the Israel of 1967 and his novel, through exploration of the stories of so many Israelis, reveals the strengths and weaknesses of Israeli culture. Among the strengths revealed is Israel's knack for bonding together an incredibly diverse group of people from the far corners of the planet (All parts of the Arab world, Europe, North America, and even Asia). Among some of the weaknesses revealed are the societal conflict (and discrimination) between Ashkenazi Jews of mostly European heritage and Sephardi Jews of primarily Asian (mostly Middle Eastern and North African) heritage. Mr. Berkman uses the term Oriental to describe Sephardi Jews, which in that day was considered acceptable (although the term Oriental in these days in considered politically incorrect). I mention this because I wouldn't want younger readers to misconstrue the use of the term as meaning that the book is insensitive to others. 1969 was another time and social realities were different (let alone language).<br />While I enjoyed what the stories revealed about Israeli society, the true treasure of the novel are the people stories. The feelings, hopes and desires reveal a world more about Israel than their actions could. This novels works as a great companion to any of the political or military histories of the Six Day War. I would also like to mention that Mr. Berkman writes using American-English idiom, which might require referencing for some non-American readers (baseball analogies, American political idiom, etc.). Although it is not academically referenced or footnoted, the writing is very poignant and captivating. I found the book a very entertaining read that was hard to put down.<br />I highly recommend this book as good background material to any study of Six Day War of 1967 or to anyone interested in the social realities of Israel.	2002-11-15

Unfortunately for him, it's because he's notorious. This little 1990 book (268 pages with intro, bibliography, appendixes, etc.) was published as an inexpensive trade paperback before the world's campaign to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait (1991).<br />While the book is very dated (12 years ago as of 2002), the information regarding Saddam Hussein's rise to power and the history of Iraq from its' creation by the British is still very valid. While I find it a little difficult to read about some of the things that Saddam Hussein had done, I feel much better informed about him and will be ready with facts next time his name comes up at the lunch table at work.<br />The book is divided into 11 helpful chapters that cover just about anything someone would want to know about Iraq and the events that eventually led to Desert Storm. It is a well- supported novel with several appendixes with maps, bibliographies, a Human Rights report, and other useful information. The authors are from The New York Times newspaper and Harvard University so it would be a good assumption that they don't hesitate to criticize President Bush's 1990 US government. While they criticize the government, I don't think they overdo it and I don't think they would upset a genuine US patriot.<br />Another good novel to read, in this vein, is \\"Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography\\" by Efraim Karsh.<br />CONCLUSION:<br />A great inexpensive novel to learn more about Saddam Hussein and Iraq. Recommended.	2002-10-29

What that means is although the Merkhava Mk.IV made its' debut this year, the book has material that is now dated (The book's text only alludes to the Merkhava Mk.IV). <br />However, the New Vanguard series isn't a sales brochure meant to be the latest and greatest, but a book of historical art plates and background information for modellers, gamers, and military history enthusiasts. If you're buying the book as I did looking for great color plates and some background information then this is a great buy. I love my copy. Peter Sarson, the illustrator, is world-renowned and well-deserving of his spectacular cut-aways and drawings. I've found the book incredibly useful for the paintjobs and extra detailing on the Merkhava models I'm working on.<br />Don't buy this book if you only want up-to-date statistical information about the Merkhava tank series...<br />BUT, do buy this book if you're looking for wonderful color plates of the Merkhava tanks, a useful history of the tank, some great photographs, and some other great information. I recommend the book for those reasons.<br />My only criticism is that the book gives the lion's share of credit for the Merkhava design to General Tal, but many sources are now beginning to credit another officer, Yisrael Tilan - who also designed the tank, quarreled with Tal and later left the project. Hopefully another publisher will eventually give Yisrael Tilan the credit that he deserves.	2002-10-29
US	49197174	R2UX3W0HFTKKO	068417488X	481487614	The Yom Kippur War	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Tells the Story From the UK Point of View	Peter Allen is a British writer and has told his version of the events of the 1973 Yom Kippur War (also called the Ramadan War by the Egyptians, the Tishreen War by the Syrians, and sometimes the October War elsewhere) using a point of view very similar to the UK's stance in 1973. What I mean by this is that the UK had made many investments politically, miltarily, and economically in many of the Arab states and so often took a pro-Arab stance during the Yom Kippur War while at the same time being a strong ally of the USA and a member of NATO, which led to occasional support for Israel. Allen mirrors this British government stance in that some parts of his book advocate Arab forces and others seem to support the Israelis at the expense of the Soviets. Although Allen is partisan (he relates his opinions with no concern about being impartial to either side), this book, nevertheless, is a great and entertaining read.<br />What Peter Allen did do was interview hundreds of the fighters (both Arab and Israeli) of the Yom Kippur War which culminated in this entertaining 1982 book. If you are looking for a book to support academic arguments then this isn't the book for you, Allen didn't use footnotes although he did list a bibliography of selected materials. His interviews also weren't documented as Israeli security doesn't often allow interviewee's give their names and most Arab interviewee's (primarily Egyptians) were also not allowed to give out their names except in a few cases where approved by the Egyptian government. While Syria won't help most researchers of this war (in which Syria was militarily defeated), at the time of publishing, the author initimated he was able to interview some Syrians incognito abroad.<br />Why buy the book?<br />The story is told very well and having been a WWII historian before this book, Allen makes a number of interesting comparisons between WWII generals such as Patton and Montgomery and Arab and Israeli generals. He also did some verygood research and his telling of the conflict includes the political aspects of the war (What vexed Golda Meir, how Sadat was dealing with the Soviets, etc.), the tactical miltary aspects of the war (how the Israelis continued to practice tactics developed in the 1967 War, how the Egyptians failed to venture out from under their missile shield, etc.), strategic elements (the Israelis always plan to carry war to the enemy's soil, the Arabs plannned very limited victory conditions, etc.), as well as some great individual stories gained from his research and interviews.<br />The maps included with the book are excellent and much easier to read than those of many other books chronicling the Yom Kippur War. The maps include important ridges and hills that are often left out. The two photographic inserts have some rare photographs such as those of the Israeli Gilowa bridging craft, the Israeli home-made steel roller bridge, and some great pictures of the Arab Egyptian forces. Some of the Egyptian army photos are exclusives that I haven't seen in any other books chronicling the period and I have most books about the Yom Kippur War published between 1973 and 2002. Allen's exclusive Egyptian photos are a result of his friendship with H. el Komayessi, an Egyptian photographer during the war. I will however point out that at least two of the photographs are incorrectly labelled:<br />1. One photograph is labeled &quot;Egyptain crossing equipment,&quot; but actually has a photo of cheering Egyptian soldiers around a Sherman tank with observation equipment and Israeli ID markings.<br />2. Another photograph is labelled &quot;Wreckage of Israeli Phantom, downed by a missile&quot; but actually is the wreckage of a liason plane. <br />I'm not sure if the incorrectly-labelled photographs are a result of Peter Allen's or el Komayessi's error.<br />My favorite part of the book, however, were the many individual vignettes that the author included interspersed throughout the book. The many stories of individual soldiers, journalists, civilians, and observers make the story come alive with a nice human touch. Some of the things that Allan wrote that Sadat said to Kosygin were full of humor (mostly taken from Sadat's memoirs).<br />This book makes a nice addition to any of Chaim Herzog's or Egyptian general Shazli's accounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. However, it is a much more general accounting of the war and is, as previously mentioned, not vigorously documented.	2002-10-22

I've been a Russian-language teacher / learner for well over two decades now and out of the twelve books I have pertaining to Russian verbs, this is by far my favorite and the most useful for either a student or a teacher. I call myself a teacher / learner both because I have taught Russian at both the highschool, college, and university level, but because I think that learning a language is a continual process (even for one's native language) and I'm still learning happily!<br />For students it has a comprehensive and not-overly-complicated explanation of how Russian verbs work grammatically with coherent examples and, best of all, wonderful illustration that make comprehending the complicated (in comparison with English) Russian verb system accessible. It has easy work sheets, which can be used in the book or xeroxed for multiple uses.<br />For teachers, those same work sheets can be made as in-class reinforcement of the verb section in your primary textbook. It also has such wonderful explanations of how the verb system works (I wish I could explain it as wonderfully as the author does with my imperfect English) that I frequently borrow his explanations for the home-made handouts and reference sheets that I prepare for my students.<br />I highly recommend this book in addition to the main textbook that a student may be using or as a side study to help a student master Russian verbs. This book is especially useful when combined with &quot;501 Russian Verbs: Fully Conjugated in All the Tenses Alphabetically Arranged (501 Verbs Series)&quot; by Thomas R., Jr. Beyer.<br />If you want to eventually speak Russian fluently then this book is a great way to start!	2002-10-21

One of the residual after-effects of the Cold War is that most Russian/English - English/Russian dictionaries were written using British English. While in many ways I appreciate British English, such dictionaries come up lacking for Russian-speakers that want to learn American English or for American-English-speakers that want to learn Russian. For instance, most Russian-published dictionaries use British English, which can be a trifle annoying for all those Americans who don't know what a pram is!<br />Kenneth Katzner's wonderful dictionary was the first (or at least one of the first) dictionaries specifically written using American English. As a former Russian teacher in the United States, I found this book a &quot;God-send&quot; for some of the things that my students in the United States wanted me to teach them. While I'm a fluent Russian speaker, I simply don't use some types of vocabulary anymore since I live in the United States and sometimes I have great difficulty recalling certain sorts of words and acronyms in English let alone Russian. This dictionary was wonderful not only for me as a Russian and English literate teacher, but also for my students who often times couldn't find words exclusive to American English in their dictionaries.<br />Some versions of the dictionary have handy grammar and culture references as well (There have been several editions published over the years and Katzner wonderfully updates this book every few years). I say different editions because I have owned several copies of this book over the years (I bought a few and others were publisher's samples) and usually keep just one, giving any extras away to my students (usually as a prize in class). One of my favorite features of one of the editions was a reference glossary with commonly used abbreviations (such as Dr., Str., etc.). Other additions also have Russian/English glossaries of place names (countries, geographical features, states, etc.). Try to buy the most recent editionof this book if possible since it will have the most updates and helpful features.   <br />I highly recommend this book for either American -English speaker trying to learn Russian or Russian-speakers trying to learn American English. It's the very first dictionary that any American-English-speaker studying Russian should buy.	2002-10-20

He has authored numerous books about the events occurring in the Middle East.<br />This is his seminal work recounting the events of the IDF (Israeli Defence Force) armored unit that he accompanied during the 1967 Six Day War. His accounts of the armored combat and land warfare that occurred are absolutely gripping. Reading is book is almost like experiencing tanks bogging down in sand, firing main gun rounds, and being hit critically and set aflame. The many first-hand accounts are very detailed and set inbetween the events of the war that occurred.<br />There a very few books that recount the history of the armored corps in Israel as well as \\"The Tanks of Tammuz.\\" Most later books on armored warfare during the 1967 war quote Teveth. For example, I have half a dozen US military documents about the Arab-Israeli conflict from my military days and every one of them quotes Teveth. <br />I highly recommend \\"The Tanks of Tammuz\\" for anyone wanting to know more about the land warfare that went on during the 1967 Six Day War and the history and development of the Israeli forces that resoundingly won the war on the military battlefield.	2002-10-16

What Samuel Katz has written is an informative history of one particularly notorious genocide-bomber (popularly called suicide-bombers in the media) and the effect his bombing attacks had on the Israeli people and their government.<br />He provides every kind of background and history needed to be well-informed about what happened. Some of the data provided include familial history of Yehiyyah Ayash \\"The Engineer,\\" the political infighting among Israeli governmental agencies how to combat Ayash, details of operations against terrorism by the Sayeret Matkal, how the attacks effected the Israeli public (both Jewish-Israelis and Arab-Israelis no matter what their faith), and other background. <br />With the tight security precautions that Israelis show, don't expect too many details about what happened that aren't widespread public knowledge already. Katz does detail how many of the bombs were made from easily purchasable materials, but not in so much detail that bombs will be made using the information from this novel. It's definitely tamer than the \\"Anarchist Cookbook\\" if you get my drift. Some of what can be done with a cell phone was fascinating....<br />I recommend the book for anyone wanting to know more how terrorism can affect international politics and a society. This book could be especially useful in light of the 9-11 terrorist attack on the USA. The Israeli's history can be a sort of testbed for other nations that will soon have to deal with continual attacks from terrorist organizations.<br />Don't read this book if you want an in-depth study of Palestinian-Arab society. He does talk about some factors involved in producing Genocide-bombers, but I wouldn't call the book friendly to Palestinian-Arab interests in any way, shape, or form. Katz simply isn't an apologist for terrorists. At the same time, I detect a sympathy for the suffering Palestinian-Arab people. <br />If you are looking for good books about Israeli spies, try \\"Every Spy a Prince\\" by Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman or \\"Soldier Spies\\" also by Samuel Katz.<br />End Impression: \\"The Hunt for the Engineer\\" is a great book if you know what you're looking for. If what your looking for is an insightful look at terrorism and how to combat it, this is a great read!	2002-10-16

As a popularized account and history of the Heyl Ha'Avir (Israeli Air Force) intended for Western audiences, it's a great book and I'd highly recommend it. Its' photographic inserts are very nice as well.<br />However, as a comprehensive history of the Heyl Ha'Avir, it's a very dated book. I'd still recommend it for its' great background and photographs, but as of 2002, there are better references on the Heyl Ha'Avir available. I called my review \\"Great Prequel to Lon Nordeen's 'Fighters Over Israel'\\" because this book works great as an unofficial \\"prequel.\\" <br />I should mention one other thing and that is that this book was published in the UK and some of the outlooks on Heyl Ha'Avir history differ from Israeli or American outlooks of Heyl Ha'Avir history.	2002-10-15

Samuel Katz, an IDF veteran of Operation Oeace for Galilee, is also a veteran chronicler of the Israeli Defence Forces and an experienced terrorist profiler. His sabra (native-born Israeli) wife helps give him an edge over non-Hebrew-speaking IDF researchers.<br />Israel's Air Force - The Power Series is a great book to gain information about the Hel Ha'Avir or the Israeli Air Force (IAF). The book is a great complement to other IAF book such as those by Lon Nordeen, Peter Mersky, Salvador Huertas, or others. What it offers that others don't is a chapter-by-chapter overview of the IAF that is easily accessible. Chapters cover such details and information as: A comprehesive introduction, a great IAF history up to 1991 including a rivetting story of the rescue of a downed flier in Lebanon, background on IAF pilots and training, IAF airbases, the helicopter forces (a relatively new branch of the IAF), the IAF Aeromedical Evacuation Units, the air defence forces, as well as a handy aircraft glossary.<br />I highly recommend this book and its' companion: Israel's Army - Landpower #3005. They are the very best introductory and general volumes available on the IDF.	2002-10-15

While I've called the book historical fiction, I only do so because Israeli security precautions precluded the author from telling everything he had seen. I would imagine that IDF censors went over the author's manuscripts many times before finding a copy they could live with.<br />Having said that, I highly recommend \\"Zanek\\" as a novel to provide wonderful background to what Heyl Ha'Avir operations must have been like during the War of Attrition. The characters and personalities must be portrayals of actual people because their life likenesses are just too keen. Interestingly enough, Lom Nordeen's 1990 book \\"Fighters Over Israel\\" seems to verify what the author, William Stevenson, wrote back in 1971 in this little paperback. The picture insert has some great photographs of Heyl Ha'Avir aircraft and personnel.<br />If you'd like a feel for what the Heyl Ha'Avir is like from a personal perspective, please buy \\"Zanek!\\"	2002-10-15

He served in the IDF during the War in Lebanon and then left the service to pursue a writing career. His wife is a sabra (native-born Israeli) so he has access to Hebrew research sources, which give him an edge up on many non-Hebrew-speaking IDF researchers. <br />This book is an exceptionally easy look into the difficult-to-research and security-conscious Israeli Defence Force. This book concentrates on the IDF ground forces including chapters on the IDF order of battle, some IDF background history, the Giva'ati brigade, the paratroopers, the Armored branch, the Golani brigade, the Merkhava tank, the Na'ha'l, Israeli officers, the role of females and older rservists, and an appendix on Israeli armament. While I wouldn't necessarily call it an in-depth study of the IDF, I would say that it is a very comprehensive introduction to the IDF complete with beautiful photographs. Some of the photographs are ones I've not seen elsewhere and I think I've seen most of the phototographs in the Israeli National Archives! It is also one of the few books published about the IDF in 1990 and is fully up-to-date as of 1990 IDF history.<br />I highly recommend this book for IDF fans, military gamers, military history enthusiasts, or others with some sort of interest in the Israeli military.

When I looked at Amazon.com and didn't find a review of Lon Nordeen's \\"Fighters Over Israel\\", I was very surprised since this book is one of the few really great accounts of the Heyl Ha'Avir's dinstinguished and colorful history along with similar books by Salvador Huertas, Peter Mersky, and others. <br />In just a few words or so, this book is considered a classic of its' type with engrossing background, history, and captivating personal accounts that the author gleened from interviews with Heyl Ha'Avir pilots. The novel was published in 1990 and fully covers all of the major conflicts from the 1948 War for Israeli independance to the 1982 Operation Peace for Galilee and several aerial incidents between 1982 and the book's 1990 publishing date.<br />Perhaps one of the greatest aspects of the novel is Lon Nordeen's insight into how Israel managed to build a barely third-world air force into one of the world's preemminant world air powers. The secret in a word is \\"people.\\" The Heyl Ha'Avir's recruitment and training programs are truly innovative and interesting beyond words to read about.<br />The book's three picture inserts have some great photographs and illustrations as well.<br />If you are a fan of the Heyl Ha'Avir, the IDF, jet warfare, miltary history, or just want to read some great accounts of jet combat in the Middle East, definitely purchase and enjoy this book.	2002-10-15

I say overly biased because all author have an opinion that is expressed overtly or covertly in their writing. <br />Richard A. Gabriel, a well-respected professor of politics at St. Anselm College, former US Army intelligence officer, and consultant to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees as well as the Pentagon, has written what is probable the most objective and well-written account of the 1982 War in Lebanon between Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, PLO, and other forces. He has written numerous books about military actions including several books that constructively criticized the American actions in Vietnam. Several of his books have since become requred reading for courses at military academies.<br />Prof. Gabriel went out of his way to write an objective analysis of the combat, going so far as to interview PLO officials, IDF soldiers, and others. He also toured the battefields as they occurred as a guest of the IDF. Even more to his credit, he made a stipulation of his touring the front with the IDF that IDF miltary censors not be able to review his transcripts at all until after publishing. This means that he was able to effectively write whatever he wanted.<br />The book itself is brilliant. Within its' 242 pages are numerous analyses of various tactical and strategic conflicts of the 1982 War. He lists grievances and events of all sides into the war and yet hesitates to make value judgements about any of them short of miltary stance. While avoidings making the book a massive judgement of the political stance of any of the fighters, he doesn't hesitate to list political factors that the combatants considered at the time of the war.<br />One of the greatest treasures of having toured Lebanon and the conditions there is that he was able to disprove many of the false accounts that the media of the time forwarded to the public. Being a meticulous researcher also means that he always quotes sources and provides appropriate background. For instance, the PLO (through the Lebanese newspaper \\"An Nahar\\")claimed that Israeli forces killed 17,825 civilian noncombatants killed and wounded 30,103 civilians. Mr. Gabriel analyzed all of the data available from various sources (including interviews with village mayors and other on-the-site witnesses) and came up with a more likely figure of 4,000 to 5,000 killed and 12,000 to 14,000 wounded.<br />If you are looking for an account of the 1982 war that objectively evaluates military actions of the combatants then Prof. Richard A. Gabriel's \\"Operation Peace for Galilee - The Israeli-PLO War in Lebanon\\" is unparallelled. I highly recommend reading this book whether you are looking for more background on the Arab-Israeli conflict, are a military historian, a wargamer, or just someone interested in knowing more about the Middle-East.	2002-10-12

They're both captivating authors. <br />It's hard to believe that one can absorb many of the most important understandings of so many different religions in one 186 page paperback novel.<br />How does he do it?<br />He writes a chapter out of faith and separates it in to a few sections that include the following:<BR>- A reasonable and straight-forward encapsulation of the faith's most important tenets, beliefs, and/or dogma in the form of easy-to-read stories that followers of the religions themselves prize and making lists where it helps of the religion's beliefs to make it easy to compare and contrast..<BR>- Actual samples from the religion's literature including proverbs, poems, psalms, stories, and other forms of written and oral wisdom.<br />In addition, Mr. Gaer includes introduction, which defines what religion is and sets boundaries for how religion is discussed in this book as well as a final chapter with statistics on the various faiths and how they affect our world.<br />I bought this book back in the early 1980's and I still treasure it and use it as a reference. I've received many many compliments over the years from Muslims, Sikhs, and members of other religions because I was able to go home and read 30 minutes of Jospeh Gaer and pick up enough of an understanding of their religion that they were impressed. <br />With the 9-11 terrorist bombing still in my thoughts, I went to this book to refresh my knowledge of Islam before going to speak with a local Imam.

It's considered a contemporary of both Heinlein (Starship Troopers) and Asimov (The Foundation series). <br />The author pulled from his own experience during the Vietnam war to create the psychological experience of actual combat; that is to say the seemingly endless waiting, nagging fear, adrenalin rush of the moment, comradely closeness, and so many other emotions that make many of us both human and soldiers. <br />At the same time, Haldeman's scientific extrapolations of where combat might go in terms of social indoctrination, training, and organization of soldiers in addition to to technical aspects of combat that reaches into the stars is nothing short of brilliant. His descriptions of starships is both believable, enjoyable, and feasible. The soldier's personal armor makes this one of the great \\"battlesuit\\" novels including Steakley's \\"Armor\\" and Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers.\\"<br />In much the same spirit that Heinlein meant \\"Starship Troopers\\" to be a critic / thought provoker about democracy and totalitarianism, it is clear that Haldeman meant \\"The Forever War\\" to be a thought provoker about war and how people relate to each other, all too often violently. Many have called this novel an \\"anti-war\\" novel or a \\"social protest\\" novel, but I think it's much more than that. Haldeman examines what it is to be a person with a conscience and how much society can change in just a few years. Thanks to Einstein's theory of relativity, the main protagonist of the book gets to take a tour across human societies of the future, some good some bad, and make his own revaltion about how people should live and what is most important in life.<br />While I recommend reading this book and enjoying it, I recommend even more rereading this book a year or so later and examining what one might learn from it. While I found \\"The Forever Book\\" an excellent read the first time through, I found it a much better read the second and third time through.	2002-09-22

Now that the Berlin Wall has fallen, it's difficult for current generations of American university students to understand what Communism was like. Even current generations of Russian immigrants have difficulty remembering Communism. This book is a link to that history that couldn't be any more brilliant. That is why Mr. Hedrick's books continues to be one of the most commonly assigned books in Russian history and politics classes. The sequel &quot;The New Russians&quot; is updated to reflect the fall of Communism and the current morass (2000) that Russia is in now. Anykind of popular story or joke that I heard then was captured in this book. The best thing about the book is that Mr. Headrick wrote in a way that could be understood by the average American (meaning even my students could understand this book!). If you don't have much of a feel for what life was like in Russia when it was the USSR, then the &quot;Russians&quot; is your ticket to both understanding and getting a feel for life under Communism.	2000-11-20

I have been to Russia quite a number of times and I always marvel at the number of beautiful and often well educated women who are single.

If nothing else, this book can be an eyeopener for American guys looking for a woman out of the United States 1950s: a woman who wants to stay home, raise children, keep house, and please her man. Don't get me wrong, many Russian woman are liberated and demand equality, but they do it in the framework of putting home and hearth first in their lives.

The book is essentially an adaption of two medieval  scholars' NOVA television special that aired on public television  (PBS)recently (1999). The authors of this book, both university professors  of medieval studies, really know what they're talking about and this book  is ready proof that they've spent a life researching medieval culture and  warfare. I checked this book out from my local public library and have now  hinted to my girlfriend that I'd like a copy for my birthday! The text is  well-written, easy-to-read, factual as well as interesting, and, best of  all, embellished with wonderful period illustrations. I enjoyed this book  as did the sixth-grade child who I have tutoring in history. While my young  tutoree enjoyed the book, the text is most definitely written for adult  readers. I highly advise this book to those who want to learn more about  castles and medieval warfare.	2000-07-09

It is still on my shelves as an adult. I find it a masterpiece of interesting, quick reading coupled with Macaulay's well-acclaimed and wonderful illustrations. Macaulay's wonderful illustrations show pictorially exactly how a castle was built in stages, who did the work from the master architect to the most common laborer, how the castle functioned in war along with the troops that manned it, and even how the castle could be used as an economic and political bastion against enemies. I also want to add that Macaulay allowed PBS to make an animated TV special of his book around the 1980's that can still be found if one looks.<br />I named my childhood pet fish after the characters in this book. While my review of this book is most definitely fanatical, I cannot emphasize enough how charming this book really is. It's the pinnacle of fun castle books for a castle enthusiast, child or adult!	2000-07-09

I'd easily placeit with David Macauley's classic &quot;Castles.&quot; What reallymakes this book is its wonderful cross-section illustrations of castles which make the architecture of the castle easily accessible to the reader, child or adult.  As castle model builder, this book was a &quot;god-send.&quot; I have used the many illustrations and comment to make blueprints for my castle reproductions...the ultimate compliment to this book came from my nephews (4 &amp; 5yo) who ask their uncle every visit to pull down this book and read about castles!	2000-07-09
