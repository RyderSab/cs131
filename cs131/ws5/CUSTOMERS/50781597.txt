US	50781597	R3Q6MEWEFXJJNC	0743257529	760447173	China, Inc.: How the Rise of the Next Superpower Challenges America and the World	Books	4	14	16	N	Y	The first chapter tells the whole book	China Inc. shouldn't be much of a surprise after the first chapter or so. If you've been paying attention to the latest headlines on China then you've pretty much got the gist. The book is just one story after another about how China uses its massive labor force to literally run the country like a company. From DVDs to leather belts and cars to mobile phones, China has a nearly inexhaustible supply of human capitol which means it can do things cheaper than ever before. In this book you'll find out how they do it, which industries they're in, and a good sense of where the future of China lies.  <br /> <br />The title is very befitting as you'll see time and time again. Ted Fishman doesn't go much beyond repetitive examples of Chinese progress, but he does ocassionall identify some points of weaknesses here and there.  <br /> <br />This book is good if you have no clue about the rise of China and its economic power. If you've lost your job because of China, this is a good place to find out why.  <br /> <br />Who this book is NOT for is someone who wants answers to countering Chinese economic advancement, Americas foreign policy solutions, and actual weaknesses of the Chinese economy. Fishman is a journalist not a policy wonk, he reports and that's it.  <br /> <br />This book will scare you. It will make you think twice about that giant country thousands of miles away. You might even think learning Chinese would be a good thing about now...	2005-08-11

Unfortunately this book isn't what it's billed as. Lola Cashman paints a very distorted picture of U2 that completely contradicts every other backstage account. It cannot be emphasized enough that she's an ex-employee, asked to leave, and is now trying to use her time with U2 for a monetary advantage. Ms. Cashman tries too hard to inject herself into the U2 \\"lifestyle\\". Rather than it being an objective 3rd person account of life as a HAIR DRESSER for U2, she instead tries to inject herself into the band itself as though she was a member. What you have is an angry, ex-employee, still believing she is part of the band.  <br /> <br />Any doubts? Just go read the press and see what the band has to say about her.	2005-07-05

What starts out, seemingly, like another Robin Cook thriller quickly turns into a rant about managed health care and the beef industry. There's also several gaps in the story, like he started writing it, got bored and left, then came back later and started forgetting where he was going the last time. The ending sucked. There was no finalty, to wrap up, not even something to think about it. Shortly into the book you're left scratching your head about the characters. The main two, Kim and Tracy, don't act like typical parents, or any of the other situations where you'd expect normal people to act...  <br /> <br />Toxin is a scary book. You'll stop eating (hamburgers) for a while. Cook makes really great points about managed health care, the USDA, and fast food in general. Just think it might've read better had Toxin been a non-fiction book about those subjects than trying to slop some half-baked fictional story around it...	2005-05-19

I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" after being bombarded by mainstream and gay press as this being the new wonder boy in story telling. I expected fiction but instead got Mr. Sedaris's life rehashed with little anecdotes and humor interjected in between. Most of the stories will make you chuckle here and there, some real writing talent, but they don't even begin to touch real stories that you'll remember and reflect upon. It's just like he's sitting in a coffee shop recalling stories from his life and throwing some humor in there. Kinda pulp I'd say. One important note though: If you've never heard David Sedaris talk you've got to find some NPR interviews or something. He has a high pitched, feminine voice, that at first had me thinking he was a 70 year old Billy Corgan. Once you've heard his voice it actually makes reading the stories much more entertaining; because you've got him narrating them in your head! Decent stories, great writing style, but not much thought in there.	2005-01-12

Despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is NOT a computer crime novel. In fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. One positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc. are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some time abroad again.	2005-01-12

It starts off with the usual quirks that make a Chuck Palahniuk novel: unusual facts that you never thought about, complex plots that suddenly explode into something greater, and some pretty screwed up characters. Welcome to the world according to Palahniuk.  <br /> <br />Diary is a fiction novel that someone decided to throw an actual diary into. Misty Marie Kleinman is our main character and she lives on Waytansea Island, a cross between that island vacation you see rich people going to and the sad little towns that nobody goes to anymore. Her husband just tried to commit suicide and all the island residents can think about is when Misty Marie will start painting again. The first few pages will grab you but from there on out it'll be a test of endurance: can you take the weird plot, annoying characters, and the crying desire for some REAL DRAMA!  <br /> <br />Like most Palahniuk novels this one was made to read only half of it and then leave it sitting somewhere, forgotten. The plot took far too long to develop, bogged down right in the middle, spent way too much time on really simple things, and makes a haphazardly attempt to pick it up at the end. Such a waste. Go read/watch Fight Club: it's the only good thing Palahniuks' ever done.  <br />	2004-12-29

The best thing about all John Case novels is RESEARCH! They go out of their way to develop some really intricate, complex plots that really become a learning experience wrapped in a really great story. The last book by the authors, The Eighth Day, just didn't live up to the realism and thought out plots but The Murder Artist definitely makes up for it.  <br /> <br />The story centers around a journalist whose children have been kidnapped. Rather than waiting around and crying daily on TV like other parents he decides to do something about it. Here the Murder Artist takes off and you'll delve into suck topics as magic, origami, voodoo, carnivals, and the mind of evil. It's all there.  <br /> <br />Read the Murder Artist and you'll suddenly find yourself not only thrilled and entertained, but you'll learn a LOT of really interesting stuff.	2004-12-29

If you've ever sat around and watched the news and saw some terrorist attack and wished your government would just go kill them then this is YOUR BOOK. If you happen to pickup the paperback open to the inside cover and look at the picture: it says it all. The book is about Sam Fisher, an American intelligence officer with one mission: protect the United States at all cost; the image of a rogue warrior moving through the night and taking out evil where it sleeps.  <br /> <br />Leave it to Tom Clancy to show the world exactly what countries SHOULD be doing. Splinter Cell combines realism, action, some pretty cool stuff like martial arts and technology, but more importantly it has that James Bond techno-geek appeal. The main character will remind you of Gabriel Allon from Daniel Silva' books, or just imagine Jason Bourne for real. My only complaint is that the writing sometimes switched between first person and third person when it moved between people. I'd preferred it stayed the same throughout, perhaps better third person.  <br /> <br />Overall this is a great book. If you've ever gotten pissed off about terrorism and wish somebody would do something about it: READ THIS BOOK! I hope somebody in Washington reads this book SOON! <br />	2004-12-29

A lot of the cover reviews etc. for this book were along the lines of intense and spell bounding but I just didn't see it. The novel takes a relatively simple, small story, throws in some Fargo type dark humor, an interesting narrator, and ends up as though it were dragging you through some awful carnival exhibit. While the story itself, the strange suicide of five sisters, is very interesting and deserving of being told, I think it completely lacks impact or serious drama to keep the reader going. I found myself desperately just trying to get it over with. If you're looking for some creative writing and witty remarks then this is it. On the other hand if you want something dramatic, gripping, poignant, or even revealing then just skip it. Don't believe the reviews on the back of the book.	2004-12-20

Old School tries very hard to take a mediocre story, build tension, and overflow with drama. Sadly it just ends as \\"a good book\\" without any real substance. I didn't feel myself dwelling on the characters very much. I also couldn't see the characters themselves which is a surprise because Mr. Wolff really develops his characters. It just kind of beats the \\"boys at a boarding school\\" line too much and we miss out on the drama that could've been.	2004-12-20

John Case novels are by default intricate, thoroughly researched, and very well thought out. On the other hand with the Eighth Day the characters just sucked. There's a really good story here: billionaire wants to stop the spreading of rumors so he hires a PI. The problem is you throw in an immature kid who hardly seems the detective type and along way you plug in characters that seem like they'd be okay but never get developed enough. What you end up with is a poorly written, cheap novel. I hate to say it because I'm a BIG John Case fan but this one just didn't hit it. We only get a very superficial read on the characters themselves, especially the secondary characters, and as for Danny the main character it seemed like the author was trying too hard to make this goofy kid a real detective!  <br /> <br />On the other hand I have to give the authors credit: they really knew their stuff, from art to the detailed geography many authors try to fake. I could visualize the places the characters were describing and I could imagine myself there with them. They did some great research for this. However in the end I just felt like the characters were thrown in hastily without any real development and it just turned sour.  <br /> <br />On a side note: The new John Case book \\"The Murder Artist\\" is really good so I'd say if you were disappointed with the Eighth Day please give the new one a chance, it'll make up for it and then some.  <br />	2004-12-20

In ways it did just that but in a lot of ways it left me lacking.  <br /> <br />Make no mistake about it: Scott Turow is a great writer and he knows what he's talking about. On the other hand the book suddenly got very intrinsic sometimes and went off on a personal journey of discovery. Where it lacked was in the greater details of the law school environment, what it took to get in, and maybe the evolution of law school.  <br /> <br />Another critical point is that it was written in the late 70s. By all accounts law school has changed A LOT since then. Another critique, and this is of no fault for Mr. Turow, but he's older and married in his first year of law school. The new entering classes are much younger and don't have the experience or maturity that Mr. Turow had. If you're on your way to law school and you're serious about it, you might skip it until AFTER your first year. On the other hand if you know absolutely nothing about or you like legal novels go for it.  <br />	2004-11-13

Michael Moore is a very intelligent man. Granted. However this book hits on what exactly is wrong with Michael Moore: he warps the truth and plain lies in order to make a point. Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man presents who Michael Moore is in relation to his movie Fahrenheit 9/11. It's not so much of an attack on Mr. Moore as it is a correction and the other side.  <br /> <br />If you've watched Fahrenheit 9/11 and loved it, read this book. If you hated it, read this book. You cannot nor should you take one source or one side of an argument and run with it as absolute truth. This is why this book deserves to be read. It's unfortunate that Amazon will only list kids and one sided reviews.	2004-11-08

Just the name caught my eye and so I bought it thinking it would be a similar to Masters of Deception or Mitnick story, but it wasn't. The entire book is just Mr. Nuwere recounting his exploits from America Online to large corporations, throwing in a good bit about the mean streets of New York, and rounding out (literally) with some non-relevant martial arts. After reading it I was really let down. I was looking for something a little more definitive about computer security, the evolution of it from the time he was a kid to now, etc. Sad to say Masters of Deception was a better book than this but nothing will ever come close to the writing talent, intrigue, and plain storytelling than Cliff Stoll's book the Cuckoo's Egg. Maybe in twenty years if Mr. Nuwere wrote another book and explained what he's learned after spending some time OUT of the mean streets then perhaps it'd be a better book. Right now it's just a feel good made for TV movie.	2004-08-09

On the other hand it is EXTREMELY hard to read as a book because all of the citations are put right in the middle of the reading; as such it doesn't flow at all.

On the other hand she goes into great depth on some atrocities and completely skips others; such as East Timor. The first half of the book is clearly a definitive history of genocide including Raphael Lemkin and the formations of the United Nations and the genocide convention. Then the second half dives head first into the Cambodian, Rwandan, and Yugoslavian genocides. While this book is critical of US foreign policy on international human rights, she does surmise that it may have been &quot;the best&quot; policy at the time; tragically as it was. This is an excellent book on the history of human rights protections. Her introduction lays out all of her main points and ideas very clearly so there isn't any guess work or trying to find the point. Definitely worth the read.	2004-08-01

Julie Mertus has tried very hard to paint a picture of US foreign policy as being tyrannical and adverse to human rights. Once you remove the enormous number of pages taken up by citations and references you're left with a short essay of sorts on why the United States is the worst country of human rights in the last one hundred years. Ms. Mertus draws heavily on the criticisms of others with very little of her own writing. Overall this book is just a collection of American bashing by other professors and liberal &quot;liberal scholars&quot; with NO definitive analysis of American foreign policy.

This is a padded edition with more hype on terrorism and fear than necessary. The original text by Lang and Xiangsui is a fascinating look at the true weaknesses of the American military system. It is with this book that China identifies America as its sole predominate enemy. <br />I fully believe and support our military in any and all of its endeavors. However the book correctly points out, among other things, that the US has an obsession with human casualties. It is because of this that wars are fought from a distance, with technology, in order to minimize casualties. This is something that is very evident to anyone who's looked at the American military's history. From World War 2 to Desert Storm II, the increased use of technology and the public outcry over casualties has increased ten fold. This book, correctly so, advances the theory that in the event of a war between China and America, there will be an unconventional war sorts or rather &quot;the war will be fought an won in a war beyond the battlefield&quot; using terrorism, financial institutions, computer hackers, among many others. <br />The sale of this book is mainly a money making scheme since the CIA translation is available for free all over the internet. On the other hand, this is an excellent book for any foreign policy enthusiast, but more importantly, for those military intelligence analysts who we hope are reading it. This is what China really thinks and the truth really does hurt.	2004-03-02

Finally!! <br />I've been dissapointed with Cornwell following Point of Origin. Previously her Scarpetta novels have been cookie cut-outs of crime, criminalist, and a resolution all wrapped up in cyclone of the last chapter. Not a very good way to end a book but the details have ALWAYS been top notch and the action keeping me on the edge of my eat. <br />After Point of Origin things appeared to go downhill. Nothing made sense. With &quot;Blow Fly&quot; I'm happy to say Patricia Cornwell is back on top of her gain. I was not only surprised by the new information of the characters but happy to see that maybe the characters are settling back into that predictable formula. It was a fast read and the ending left me screaming for more! I won't ruin it for anyone but I must say: It's no cyclone! The book will literally bring you to the edge of your seat until you fall off, and yet we aren't satisfied. <br />Scarpetta is older, wiser, and more refined. Lucy is on a new and prosperous track. Marino comes across as a fallen hero but soon brings himself back from the ashes.... And others come from the ashes as well to an enormous surprise. <br />Blow Fly is an excellent return. If Point of Origin was the beginning of a downslide, then Blow Fly is the return to the top with an incredible rush of excitement. <br />Great Show Ms. Cornwell!	2003-11-06

I think anyone who has ever grown up alone, an outsider, or soemone who struggles with their own inner emotions in that constant battle that plays out in private moments, would greatly benefit from this book. Stephen Chbosky does what few writers can: he pulls you along side the characters and you feel their pain and share their moments of joy...

From page one I loved it. H.F. is someone we all wish we could meet. Male or female. I totally fell in love with Beau (why can't I find a man like that?) and just her journey, not just physically, but emotionaly is enough to touch us all. A lot of people find it hard to go from the city to the country or vice versa but Ms. Watts genuinely brings our characters, stranded in a small hick town in Ketucky, to Atlanta and beyond without a hitch.

The novel does follow the live of Vincent and his diaries but it lacks a true sense of who he was. Oh we get plenty about his life, where he went, and his death but I didn't connect with Vincent as much as I did with the AUTHOR. Now this isn't a bad thing at all. Overall the book is really great but I learned more about the author and I got to know her more than I did about the books main character. Was this intentional? I don't think so but if you haven't read the book yet, when you do, try to look at the bigger picture: a teachers own self exploration vicariously through her students' diaries. Very well written and again I enjoyed it very much.	2002-05-20

The story starts out on a classic plot line, two lovers are together at the beginning and then they run into problems. The ending is classic but I won't spoil it for you. What stars as two lovers moving to a small hick town so one of them can have a job turns into a warming novel of love, friendship, and what it's like when you feel like you're the only gay person in town.

Such a novel idea: a lesbian and a gay man getting married to keep a child. The more I read Wedding Bell Blues I began to get a sense of who Julia Watts is. I wondered how much of herself she put into the book. The idea of two fixed Atlanta midtowners (myself included) moving to a small hick town in rural Georgia is a laugh in itself. When the christian radials come to take away Lilly's baby Ms. Watts leads up evenly through. The book isn't very long but is moving, funny, and very heart warming.	2002-05-08

I am nineteen years old and this book has probably changed my entire scope of the world.  Atlas Shrugged is about the joys of capitalism. In society there are basically two types of people: those who make the world turn, the capitalist, the movers and shakers, the people who drive the economy.  On the other side there are those who tend to feed off of the wealth. They beg for hand outs, do just enough to get by, and are bitter at those who have worked hard and become successful.  <br />In society we usually expect the bottom half to give out on us first. We expect them to not do the job all the way, never suceed at anything, and feed off of the hard workers.  But what if that top half of the world, the movers and the shakers, suddenly decided to stop?  What if the worlds' industrialist, business leaders, and those that drove the economy decided it just wasn't worth it anymore....<br />With its immortal cry: WHO IS JOHN GAULT? Ayn Rand has pieced together her view of capitalism and the world.  The book is about one man who vowed to stop the motors of the world:  and did.....   I would recomend this to anyone who has ever worked for something in life, only to have it stolen by another person. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to start a business, start a new career, or invest in something.  As I said this book as truly redefined my idea of capitalism, the economy, and what it means to work for something.	2001-03-23

Don't get me wrong I'm a HUGE Daniel Silva fan.  I love his common sense detail and easy to follow plots in the past.  This novel borders on everything he's created in the past with characters and places. A few of the previous characters are there but hopefully he'll bring back the painter-assassin from Mark of the Assasin and The Marching Season.  The story line was a little hard to follow at times, esp. the flash backs, but none the less a great read. <br />Basically this is a good book. If you like Silva you'll buy this book anyways. If you've never read Silva then you'll definately want to buy this book.  Reading time is about three to four days, but definately worth it.  Can't wait for the next one.	2001-01-02

It is a direct back hand to the outrageous notion that there are no gay people in todays education.  Through a series of interviews, Woog tells the story of gay students, teachers and educators who came out in school and have worked to educated others. America has this great notion that their schools are gay free, but this book slaps them all in the face. If your an educator, student, straight or gay, i think you'll find this book is filled with great insight and knowledge. No matter what sexuality you are.	2000-12-09
