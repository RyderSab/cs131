US	21386251	R2OSUGG5H6JKDC	0425132951	117838793	The House of Thunder	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Worst ending ever!	This was my 24th Dean Koontz book (I've written reviews for every one) and I thoroughly enjoyed it...up until the end when things were \\"explained\\". <br /> <br /> Susan Thornton wakes up in a hospital with partial amnesia.  She's shocked to learn she's been in a coma for three weeks after being in a car accident.  As she is being nursed back to help and a romance develops between her and Doctor Jeff McGee, Susan begins seeing terryfing visions.  Hospital patients suddenly look identical to four men who brutally murdered her boyfriend over a decade ago, and they're threatening to rape and murder her come Friday.  The nurses insist she's hallucinating.  Have the four men come back from the dead?  Are they ghosts?  Look-alikes?  Or is are they figments of Susan's aidled brain? <br /> <br /> There is one truly frightening scene where Susan is chased into the bathroom by a mysterious MAN'S voice calling her name from behind the curtain hiding her sleeping FEMALE roomate's bed.  She then closes the bathroom door only to hear someone scratching and clawing on the door, trying to get in.  Then when the noises stop, she opens the door....and no one's there.  Then she decides to look behind the curtain.... <br /> <br /> During scenes like these I seriously expected to give this book five stars, but the ending ruined all thought of that.  The explanation for Susan's \\"hallucinations\\" is ridiculous.  It's as if Koontz had no idea whatsoever how to wrap things up, so he came up with a pathetic, half-baked ending with little explanation.  What IS explaned is laughable.  It truly is the worst ending I've ever read from Koontz-very rushed and unbelieveable. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend The House Of Thunder?  Yes, but not as an introduction to Koontz.  It's most certainly a good book, with some good scares, but the ending will leave you cold.  I recommend it for established Koontz fans.  Like The Voice Of The Night, it was refreshing to have only one character viewpoint and less lenghty description. <br /> <br /> So far out of the 24 I've read, my favorites are: <br /> <br /> INTENSITY <br /> WATCHERS <br /> WHISPERS <br /> HIDEAWAY <br /> FALSE MEMORY <br /> TWILIGHT EYES <br /> DARKFALL <br />  <br />   <br /> <br />	2005-09-14
US	21386251	R295QGETY3XMJ6	0517064871	481006938	Three Complete Novels (The Servants of Twilight / Darkfall / Phantoms)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Three terrific books	Wow, Phantoms, Darkfall, and The Servants Of Twilight all in one!  I've read 23 Dean Koontz book so far and I can tell you that these are all five star books. <br /> <br /> PHANTOMS is about a deserted town in the mountains where a woman and her teenage sister arrive to find most of the residents either missing or brutally murdered-even in locked rooms. <br /> <br /> DARKFALL is about a man named Baba Lavelle out for revenge who is using voodoo to terrorize a man named Jack Dawson by sending goblin-like creatures after his two children.  It's pretty intense with the things crawling through the air ducts and chasing after the family relentlessly. <br /> <br /> THE SERVANTS OF TWILIGHT is about a cult lead by a crazy old woman named Grace Spivey who is convinced that a six year old boy named Joey is the anti-christ.  The family and the private eye struggling to protect them are terrorized and sent on the run, and their lives will never be the same.  But wherever they go, Grave and her followers always find them.... <br /> <br /> You really can't go wrong with this set.  I suggest you buy this collection, and then read: <br /> <br /> Intensity <br /> Watchers <br /> Whispers <br /> Hideaway <br /> False Memory <br /> Twilight Eyes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />     <br /> <br />	2005-09-08
US	21386251	R30X3VNGG0CWM7	0425098605	525781628	The Vision	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Did EVERYBODY but me guess the killer?	The Vision is more a mystery than horror novel.  It's about a psychic woman named Mary who spends her time helping the police track down criminals.  She was traumatized as a child (like so many Koontz characters tend to be) but has been repressing the memory of it from herself.  She can remember being raped and beaten by the family gardener, who later hung himself in his jail cell, but she also recalls the sound of wings beating and she can't recall the source and what it had to do with the attack on her.  Meanwhile a serial killer is on the loose, but she's unable to fix an image of him in her head for the police.  She's never had so much trouble trying to identify a killer before this, and try as she might, she just can't call up a picture of him in her mind.  She's having constant nightmares and is haunted by the mysterious sound of leathery wings that has haunted her since her atack.  But now she senses that the sound of wings is connected to this serial killer.   <br /> <br /> Is her childhood attacker really dead?  Is the killer possessed by his spirit?  What is the source of the sound of wings, and how is it connected to her childhood attacker and the serial killer? <br /> <br /> I was shocked at the identity of the killer, but I see that many people found it obvious, so now I'm feeling a bit slow.  I didn't see it coming a mile away.  The killer was absolutely disgusting, and what happened to Mary as a child is nauseating. <br /> <br /> The Vision is not one of Koontz's best, but it was an enjoyable two day read.  The same can be said about other Koontz books from the 70's, such as Shattered and The Face Of Fear.  I feel that Koontz's best will always be Intensity and Watchers.  I'm now moving on to my 23rd Dean Koontz-The Servants Of Twilight.	2005-09-01
US	21386251	R28VHG2M1LCD5F	0425098648	469342893	Night Chills	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Not one of his best...	This was Dean Koontz number 21 for me.  Hideaway was my first, but Intensity will always be my favorite.  Night Chills is about a single father named Paul Appendale who's vacationing in the small village of Black Water with his young son Mark and his daughter Rya.  Little do they know that three power hungry men are testing mind control methods on the town by using subliminal messages in television programs and even junk mail.  These men can control and manipulate anyone in town with the simple phrase, \\"I am the key.\\"  Needless to say their intentions are anything but good, and in the case of one of the men, perverse.     <br /> <br /> When Rya runs into a family friend commiting a brutal murder, the truth finally comes out and as the only ones unaffected by the subliminal messages, it's up to the Appendale's, Paul's girlfriend Jenny Edison, and her father Sam to find these men and put a stop to their terrifying abuse of power. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about Koontz is that 95% of the time (with the exception of Intensity), he gives information as to the history of the villians, as to how the grew up to be the people they are now.  He can take seemingly one dimensional horrifying monsters and let us peak into what makes them tick; what changed them into the people they are today. <br /> <br /> Night Chills is not one of my favorites, and in fact, I gave up and had to come back to it once or twice.  But it is, like all of Koontz's books that I've encountered so far, an enjoyable read.  It's definetely on the lower end of my favorites list, but those on the bottom are still good reads. <br /> <br /> My top favorites from Koontz would be INTENSITY, WATCHERS, WHISPERS, and THE VOICE OF THE NIGHT.	2005-08-30
US	21386251	ROY36377WA69K	0553580221	284106836	False Memory	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Loved it! (spoiler-free)	First of all, beware, because a lot of reviews here give away MAJOR spoilers, and it's much better left as a surprise. <br /> <br /> This was my 20th Dean Koontz read, and now one of my favorites.  It's a fascinating psychological thriller about a woman named Marti who's up to her neck in problems.  She already struggles with helping her phobic friend Susan, who is terrified of leaving her home and must be helped to her therapy sessions once a week.  But now Marti is developing a phobia of her own-a fear of herself.  She's suddenly terrified of her reflection and her own shadow, terrified of hurting someone for reasons she cannot comprehend.  She throws out all of the cutlery in her house, in an attempt to make it safe.  Not only that, but now Marti's friend Susan is suspecting that her ex-husband Eric is sneaking in at night and drugging and raping her.  She can't remember anything, but she wakes up with all the signs of rape. <br /> <br /> Why had Marti developed autophobia?  Can her husband cope with her crazed behavior?  Is Eric really raping Susan?  Can either woman ever overcome their phobias?  Why do two close friends both  suddenly become the victims of severe phobias? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this book, along with: <br /> <br /> Intensity <br /> Watchers <br /> Whispers <br /> Hideaway <br /> Darkfall <br /> Twilight Eyes <br /> The Door To December <br /> Phantoms <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-08-21
US	21386251	R26ZGLU734COUM	0425128164	405259889	The Voice of the Night	Books	5	20	21	N	N	One of my favorites!	I'm surprised that this makes so many people's least favorites list.  This was Koontz number 18 for me and it looks like I'm going to have to add it to my top ten favorites!  It's more teenager oriented than his other books, much as The Funhouse was.  It should be refreshing for anyone who doesn't like Koontz's heavy descriptions, as The Voice Of The Night has much more dialogue and is lighter on the descriptions and metaphors.  It has a RL Stine rated R feel much as The Funhouse did.     Colin Jacobs is a shy, akward, nerdy fourteen year old boy who recently moved to town.  His father is a beer-guzzling, wife-beating redneck and Colin lives alone with his mother who is always working and never has time for him, nor does she ever trust him.  Colin's only friend is Roy Borden, also fourteen.  Roy sometimes likes to talk about sick things, but Colin just assumes he's putting him on.  When Roy reveals that he's killed not only animals, but people, Colin doesn't believe him.  But when Colin tries to force him into helping him cause a massive disaster in town, Colin must make the most important descision of his life.  If he refuses, Roy will kill him.  If he goes along with it, he'll be responsible for several lives.     The book was pretty disturbing at times.  Roy is a pretty messed up kid.  It's his reasons for being a messed up kid, revealed at the end, that made me shed a tear.  And it's much more than you may think.  You'd never think you could feel sorry for this twisted boy who likes to torture, maim, and fascinates about rape, but you do.     I highly recommend The Voice Of The Night, along with: Intensity, The Door To December, Watchers, Whispers, Darkfall, Hideaway, Shadowfires, The Funhouse, Twilight Eyes, and Phantoms.	2005-06-20
US	21386251	RGF1ONCXZFDZE	0553801376	598224178	One Door Away from Heaven	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not bad at all	A long time ago I checked this book out from the library and couldn't finish it.  I couldn't even make it through half of it.  Now, searching for my seventeenth Dean Koontz to read, I decided to give it another shot. <br /> <br /> I was surprised-I enjoyed it much more than I did on my first try.  I think I just needed a break, because I also tried to read a John Saul book at the time and put that down also.  One Door Away From Heaven features a 28 year old female protagonist named Michelina \\"Micky\\" Bellsong.  She reminded me a lot of Intensity's Chyna Shepard, only more bitter.  Micky was sexually abused my her mother's boyfriends as a child and over the years has relied on alchohol to get her through her struggles.  She's desperately searching for a job and currently living with her Aunt Geneva, a friendly but quirky woman.  A girl named Leilani Klonk moves in next door, and Micky and Genenva are immeditaley enchanted by this handicapped, but genius nine year old.  Leilani claims that her mother is a spaced out drug addict, her older brother was murdered, and her step-father, Preston Maddoc, has killed over a dozen people.  Both parents are extra-terrestrial-obsessed.  She claims that Preston will have her killed before her tenth birthday unless he can find aliens to heal her of her deformities.  Leilani is extremely reminiscent of Regina from Hideaway.  Another main character is a young boy named Curtis who's on the run from his mother's killers. <br /> <br /> Take a young woman with a deeply troubled past, a couple of parents who's idea of a romantic night is watching \\"Faces Of Death\\", lots of extra-terrestrial/UFO themes, a handicapped but genius little girl, a motherless boy on the run, and a ridiculously smart golden retriever, and you have One Door Away From Heaven.  It's not as good as, say, Intensity, or Whispers, but it's a good read.	2005-06-17
US	21386251	R3MQHI9AV3IGGF	0425100650	642390946	Twilight Eyes	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Without a doubt one of his best!	Twilight Eyes was my 16th Dean Koontz book.  It was definetely one of his best.  The story centers around a 17-year-old guy with the bizarre name of Slim Mackenzie who has a psychic ability called \\"Twilight Eyes\\".  He can see the goblins, evil, monstrous beings disguised as ordinary, everyday human beings.  After murdering his goblin uncle who was terrorizing his family unsuspected, Slim runs away to the Sombra Brothers carnival to work as a carnie.  There, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful older girl named Rya Raines.  Slim is determined to continue his secret war with the goblins, but is he insane, or do such things really exist?  Where did the goblins come from?  What are they trying to achieve and why? <br /> <br /> If your a Koontz fan this is a must, and if you've never read Kootz before, this is a great place to start.  Other favorites of mine include Intensity, Watchers, Whispers, The Door To December, The Funhouse, Phantoms, and Hideaway.	2005-06-01
US	21386251	R1G0CL8HMJB62H	0517073692	1483474	Three Complete Novels - Dean R. Koontz - A New Collection (Shattered/Whispers/Watchers)	Books	5	36	36	N	N	A good place to start	Watchers and Whispers are two of Dean Koontz's best.  Shattered isn't quite as good, but it's still a good read that will only take you a day or two to finish. <br /> <br /> First of all, Watchers is a MUST read.  I was skeptical that it could be *THAT* good, but it was.  It's brilliant, unforgettable, and at times, a tear jerker.  It's about a lonely, depressed man named Travis and a lonely, \\"homely\\" sheltered creepmouse of woman, Nora who are brought together by a super-intelligent golden retriever who's escaped from a government lab.  Meanwhile, a vicious failed experiment of a creature has also escaped, intent on killing the dog, whom the couple adopt and name Einstein.  It's when we learn WHY the creature wants to kill Einstein, when we learn MORE about this terrifying creature that makes our hearts break and the tears flow.  Watchers features a truly sympathetic bad guy, and the character's development and progress (espescially Nora's) throughout the story are amazing to watch.  There's also a sub-plot in the first half of the story with a psychotic cable guy stalking Nora.  Wonderful book, rivaled only by the excellent Intensity as Koontz's best. <br /> <br /> Whispers is also a fantastic book.  An aquintance sneaks into a semi-famous screenwriter's house and tries to kill and violate her.  She kills him, and one day he shows up at her house again, apparently having risen from the grave.  Unfortunately, everyone, save for one police officer, thinks she's either mistaken, nuts, or lieing for attention.  Eventually we learn that the villian is actually convinced that the female protagonist is his mother risen from the dead, in another body.  Why does does he despise his mother so much?  What are the nightmares about \\"whispers\\" that he has every night about?  How could Bruno still be around when he's been killed?  There is, of course, a budding romance between the officer and the female protagonist, and there's also a very *detailed* sex scene.  One scene wherethe villian rapes and murders a young woman is very disturbing and somewhat graphic.    <br /> <br /> Shattered is the lesser of the three, but it's still a good book, and a nice, quick, simple read just like The Face Of Fear is.  It's about a guy and his eleven year old brother who are driving across the country to meet his fiance Courtney.  Unfortunately, Courtney's jealous ex just so happens to be trailing them, along for the ride, and determined to kill him.  He tries to break into their hotel room one night and even wields an ax in one scene.  <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great place to start when it comes to Dean Koontz.  I'm currently reading my 16th Koontz book, and I highly recommend: <br /> <br /> Intensity <br /> Hideaway <br /> The Door To December <br /> Darkfall <br /> Phantoms <br /> Shadowfires <br /> Dragon Tears <br /> The Bad Place <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-05-17
US	21386251	R1OFRQQFDZHWZ	0425136981	121362210	Shadowfires	Books	5	17	18	N	N	One of Koontz's greats!	I've been a Dean Koontz fan ever since I wondered what else was out there besides Stephen King and picked up Hideaway at the library.  And now, I've just finished number 15, Shadowfires.     Since Rose Madder is my all time favorite Stephen King book, you know that I'd have to be intrigued, to say the least, at Shadowfires' summary.  Rose Madder is the story of a psychotic murderous husband chasing his wife across the country, whereas Shadowfires is about a nutty, furious husband rising from the grave and hunting his wife down.  But I was a little hesitant, seeing as this book is not very highly rated.  But then again, Darkfall is rather unpopular among Koontz fans and is one of his best, so maybe this would be the case with Shadowfires, and it was.     Rachel Leben has just decided to divorce her wealthy husband Eric.  Eric is a genius who works at a company called Geneplan where he's in charge of the Wildcard project, which he hopes will be used to prolong human lifespans.  Eric is obsessed with immortality, for reasons which we discover later on in the story.  Eric is furious when Rachel decides to leave him, and in a fit of rage, accidently gets himself run down and killed by a garbage truck.  Now Rachel is free to live in peace with her boyfriend, Benny Shadway.  Or is she?     As it turns out, Eric escapes from the morgue.  Turns out he's been his own guinea pig for his immortality experiment.  Still furious with Rachel, he sets out to track her down and slaughter her and Benny.  Unfortunately, the experiment has gone horribly wrong and is transforming him into something unspeakable at a terrifying rate.  Now the couple must find and kill Eric before he can do any more damage, while running from men from Geneplan who want to put a bullet in her head to keep her quiet about Wildcard.     At first Eric seems like a generic evil villian, but later on, when we learn more about him and his reasons for his evil ways and his obsession with immortality, we feel somesympathy for him, just as we do with villians from books such as Watchers and Whispers.     Shadowfires, like Darkfall, is extremely underrated.  But don't make the mistake of passing them by.  I consider both of them to be among Koontz's best.  Some of my favorites include Intensity, Watchers, Hideaway, The Door To December and Whispers.  I've yet to finish one that I didn't like, but Lightning, Shattered, and Dark Rivers Of The Heart were on the lower quality end for me, although still great books.	2005-05-16
US	21386251	RVAJ4BA5T4E93	0553582895	855932928	Dark Rivers of the Heart	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not my favorite	Dark Rivers Of The Heart (henceforth referred to as DROTH) was my fourteenth Dean Koontz novel. Its length is pretty intimidating, and I found myself forcing myself to go on at times. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book. The story is quite interesting. It's just so long and drawn out (the flood scene in the truck)with so much techincal mumbo jumbo. I also didn't really care for the characters as much as I do in his other books. I didn't really like the female lead very much, whereas in a book like Watchers, I became very attatched to the female lead. I never really felt attatched to the characters.  <br /> <br />The ending, when we learn about the male lead's dark past is disturbing indeed. His father was a true nutcase whose idea of \\"art\\" is extremely twisted. I love books like Intensity with psychopaths in them, but the character of Steven Ackblom just made me squirm. But I did find it very interesting and chlling. <br /> <br />DROTH also features a villian who wants to achieve perfection in the world. He's compassionate and caring, but he believes in shooting suffering or severly imperfect people in order to relieve them of their burden that he thinks they carry and simultaneously inching the world closer to perfection. You can see some of the (severly misguided) good in him, that is until he shows support for people like Steven Ackblom. <br /> <br />Basically the book is for Koontz to let out some of his political feelings. Take politics, a corrupt criminal government agency, two lonely people falling in love while running from the agency, a couple of psychopaths, and a smart dog named Rocky, and you have Dark Rivers Of The Heart.  <br />  <br /> My favorites so far are Intensity, Watchers, Whispers, Hideaway, The Door To December, Darkfall, and Phantoms.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-05
US	21386251	R1H8N7ZERE3MJE	158165071X	485108045	Darkfall	Books	5	20	22	N	N	Grossly underrated	I wasn't expecting much from Darkfall, seeing as nobody every talks about it.  While it certainly isn't very well known, it can definetely hang with Koontz's best.  Believe me, if this book is unpopular, it certainly has nothing to do with a lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Darkfall was my 13th Dean Koontz book (I've reviewed every single one I've finished), and like I said, I wasn't expecting much.  It's about a pair of police officers, Jack and Rebecca, (naturally, one is tough as nails with a difficult past, the other is gentle, and both are sexually attracted to each other) who are trying to stop a man named Baba Lavelle who uses voodoo to send demons after his victims.  Baba's motive is to slaughter an entire mafia family responsible for the death of his brother.  He didn't particularly like his brother, but he must avenge his death in order to keep the respect of his dark voodoo gods.  When Jack gets in the way, Lavelle targets his two young children, Penny and Davey.  But what is so special about Jack Dawson that Lavelle's evil magic can't touch him?  Why must he go after his kids? <br /> <br /> The front cover credits Darkfall as having \\"one of the scariest chase scenes ever\\", and rightfully so.  The scenes where the characters are hideing and running from the demons squeezing through the air ducts and clinging to their cars are fantastic. <br /> <br /> My only question is: what will stop another guy like Lavelle, experienced in voodoo, from wreaking the same sort of havoc on the earth?  Koontz doesn't say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Darkfall is disgustingly underrated.  I enjoyed it more than the popular Lightning, which I gave four stars.  If you liked Dragon Tears and Phantoms, you should definetely check out Darkfall.	2005-04-18
US	21386251	R2JX2TX5PGHGXE	0425181103	21671792	Phantoms	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Another great one!	Phantoms was the 12th Dean Koontz book I've ever read.  Phantoms was definetely NOT a let down.  Doctor Jennifer Paige is given custody of her fourteen year old sister Lisa after her mother's death and she drives Lisa up to her house in a small ski resort town in the mountains called Snowfield.  They arrive to find the town completely abandoned, with 85%% of the population missing and the rest brutally murdered.  They phones are all dead and they sense an evil presence listening in on their every word.  The fire station tornado siren wails, and church bells clang.  The voices of singing children come from the sink drain.  Bodies vanish.  Someone, or someTHING, is coming for them.  When help arrives, the group becomes stranded in the town with an unknown enemy.     Koontz doesn't hold back in this one.  People ARE going to die.  A LOT of people.  He doesn't hold back on the graphic nature of the deaths, either.  Beloved characters meet sticky ends and not everyone is going to come out in one piece.  There are also a couple of detestable characters, one being the raping motorcycle gang leader, Gene Terr.  The scene where the group finally has a dialogue with the enemy reminded me strongly of a scene in one of Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials books.  The state of the town also reminded me a lot of one of my favorite games-Silent Hill.  You can definetely see where the game creators got their inspiration for the town.     The bottom line is, it's a great book that starts off with a bang, just like my favorite Koontz book-Intensity.  Apart from Phantoms I also highly recommend the following from Koontz:     Intensity   Watchers   Hideaway   Whispers   The Door To December   The Bad Place   The Funhouse   Dragon Tears     I plan on reading-and reviewing-Darkfall and Dark Rivers Of The Heart next.	2005-04-13
US	21386251	RA4XPKD2JR4EG	0425140032	382458927	Dragon Tears	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Hideaway+The Bad Place+smart dog=Dragon Tears	Dragon Tears tells that story of two police officers, Harry and Connie who are total opposites.  Harry dislikes the use of force on the job, and he's very neat and orderly.  Connie is more careless, sloppy, and tends to handle things with too much force.  Naturally, they're both rather attracted to each other.  One day Harry finds himself being harrassed by a tall, frightening hobo with red eyes.  \\"Tick tock, you'll be dead by dawn\\", he tells him repeatedly.  Now Harry and Connie must track down and kill a serial killer who believes he's the new god coming, and has impressive supernatural powers, including the power to alter time and create golems that he can control from afar. <br /> <br /> Dragon Tears reminds me a lot of Hideaway and The Bad Place.  The villian is very young, dark-haired and handsome like in Hideaway, and has super powers from his mother's pregnancy like in The Bad Place and it overall has the feel of these two books. <br /> <br /> Take Hideaway, The Bad Place, and throw in one of Koontz's superdogs and you get Dragon Tears.  If you liked those two you'll probably like Dragon Tears, as long as you can stomache the all of the dog stuff.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-05
US	21386251	R3AITIPXJHD6R1	0449005909	38926947	Nightshade	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Good read	Nightshade is about a highschool boy named Matt Hapgood who's a star athlete, has a popular girlfriend, and a loving family.  Everything seems perfect until his grandmother Emily, a confused, bitter woman suffering from severe alzheimers disease, accidently burns down her house and moves in with the Hapgoods.  She's been abusive to Matt in the past, and treated her daughter Joan (Matt's mother) like dirt.  Joan has always been second-best to her now deceased sister, Cynthia and Emily hstill hasn't gotten over her death.  In fact, she's obsessed with her-convinced that she's still around.  She even insists on setting aside a bedroom for Cynthia for when she returns and screams at anyone who touches Cynthia's things.   <br /> <br /> On top of everything else, bodies start piling up.  People who've crossed Matt turn up missing-or worse.  The whole town thinks Matt is a phsychopath.  At first Matt is positive that he has nothing to do with these murders....but later on, he's not so sure...what's going on?? <br /> <br /> This is the only John Saul book I've read all the way through and it was good, but it's not quite King or Koontz.  The style is much simpler and it seems to be aimed more towards younger readers.  It can be refreshing to not have all of super-detailed descriptons.  If you think Koontz uses too many metaphors and too much description, you'll probably like Saul.  I'll definetely have to check out some of his other work sometime.	2005-03-30
US	21386251	R3VHJC8HFUWW4J	0425099334	756586674	Shattered	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Shattered	Shattered is definetely not one of Koontz's most popular novels, and I'd venture that a many of his fans haven't read it.  Typical fan reactions range from \\"it sucks\\" to \\"it's pretty decent\\". However, I found the premise to be interesting, picked it up, and read it in one day.  <br />  <br /> The plot is simple but intriguing.  A man named Alex is driving from Philadalphia to San Francisco to his new girlfriend Courtney's house.  Her 11 year old brother Colin is also along for the ride.  They could have taken a flight, but Alex thought it would be a nice opportunity for the two to get to know each other.  Unfortunately, Courtney's phsychotic ex-boyfriend George (we are led to believe that he may be more physically ill, possibly with a brain tumor, rather than entirely evil) is following them the whole way in his van and he wants them dead.  Not good. <br /> <br /> The book is pretty short and the typing is large, and as I said, it only took me one day to get through.   <br /> <br /> Is it Koontz's best?  No way, but it's still a nice, quick read in the vein of Face Of Fear.     <br /> <br />	2005-03-29

Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but I definetely didn't enjoy it as much as his books that I've read so far.  I picked it up after finishing the wonderful Watchers and frankly, it couldn't hold a candle to it.  I found myself groaning with boredom whenever the perspective would switch to Stefan and at times I had to push myself a bit to continue.  I didn't really feel attatched to any of the characters, and at times they were irritating.  The dialogue for the child characters is very unbelievable.  It was a good book, but I prefered the other Dean Koontz novels I've read so far (Hideaway, Watchers, Intensity, The Funhouse, Whispers, The Bad Place, The Face Of Fear, and The Door To December).	2005-03-26

He instantly befriends the friendly old man across the street you takes the Creed's through the woods up to see the pet cemetary, where the neighborhood pets have been buried for generations.

US	21386251	R1WN65MW9EK8NF	0425188809	50861192	Watchers	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Brilliant	Watchers is definetely Koontz's most popular and well-loved novel, but I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first.  Koontz had never let me down before, but how exciting could it was about a genius dog?  Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but they are typically not very thrilling to read about.       I was wrong.     Travis Cornell is a miserable, lonely man.  He lives the life of a loner, and he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.  Nora Devon is a shy, woman who has lived a sheltered, lonely life and wears drab unflattering dresses and never does her hair, because as her mother has always told her, she'll never be anything but plain and homely anyway.  Her only passion in life is her painting.      Meanwhile, two animals have escaped from a company called Banodyne.  One, a golden retriever named Einstein, was created over several years of altering genetics, creating a dog with the IQ of an average man for the purpose of using as a spy for the government. The other, a monstrous creature known as The Outsider that is determined to destroy the dog for reasons which the reader eventually learns.     Travis finds Einstein and adopts him.  He also, with the help of Einstein, saves the life of a stranger, Nora, from a sexual predator who has been stalking her relentlessly.  The two eventually fall in love and learn to find ways to communicate with Einstein.  He eventually learns to \\"speak\\" by arranging Scrabble tiles to form words and sentences.  They even teach him to read and rig him up a device that turns the pages for him.  Even though he is remarkably intelligent, he is still very much a dog.     After Nora and Travis learn of The Outsider and his murderous trek across California, coming ever closer to their home, they must protect themselves and Einstein from not only this mysterious, deadly creature, but from the people in high places that are determined to capture Einstein and take him back to the lab.     You really become intrigued and attactched to the characters in Watchers, even the ones that you see very little of.  Nora's transformation from a frightened, sheltered mouse of a woman into a brave, strong, confident woman is amazing, as is Einstein's learning progress.  The dog himself is utterly delightful and you'll long to have a dog just like him.  Even The Outsider is someone to feel for when you learn more about him and why he's after Einstein.  And his final scene made me shed a few tears onto the book.  What a sympathetic villian he was.	2005-03-21

These books are certainly NOT for religious people, espescially the third book.  They're also not for young children but should be read by teens and adults instead.  It's too hard for many kids to fully understand the deep plot, and there are some adult situations.  The reason the books are so controversial is because, in the books, their God is an evil being that they are in a war against.  This doesn't become clear until the third, possibly the second book.  I just take it that it's a different God than our own, in an alternate reality and it in no way makes me a God-hater or a religion-hater.  It's simply an alternate reality \\"what-if\\" tale-don't let it change your own beliefs.  The writer is also very liberal and anti-religion, which may offend people.  If you are religious and you prefer to stay away from them, that's fine.  I respect your beliefs.  Open-minded teens and adults without strong religious leanings will enjoy it the most.	2005-03-20

At first I was skeptical about a story that takes place almost entirely in one bedroom with the main character shackled to a bed, but it was thoroughly gripping.  Basically, Jessie and Gerald Burlingame are up to some wierd sex game where Jessie is handcuffed to the bed, but unfortunately, Gerald seems to have had a heart attack and is lieing dead on the floor and there's no one around to hear her cries for help.  I LOVED the bad guy that we meet later on in the story, he was just the craziest son of a gun you've ever seen.  I enjoyed learning about Jessie's disturbing past and her desperate attempts to break free from her chains. And I love the terrifying twist at the end when Jessie thinks she's finally gotten away....	2005-03-19

Everyone knows the plot.  A boy wizard named Harry grew up with his cruel muggle (non-magic) aunt and uncle after his parents were killed in a car crash. At the age of 11 he's informed that he's a wizard, and that an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents and very nearly killed him.  His aunt and uncle dissaproved of the world of magic and tried to keep everything a secret from Harry.  He's taken away to live at a castle called Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards where he befriends the studious, proper Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasly, a poor boy who lives in the shadow of his brothers Charlie, Percy, Bill, and Fred and George.  In book 1, Harry arrives at Hogwarts and finds that someone there is secretly trying to destroy him and is hiding a VERY big secret from the rest of the school.<br /><br /> In book 2, an unknown assailant is attacking students and everyone thinks Harry's doing it.  We learn that no less than THREE characters are not what they seem.  We are also introduced to Ron's younger sister Ginny, who has a crush on Harry.<br /><br /> In book 3, a murderous madman is on the loose and seems to be coming after Harry. But who, exactly is he?  And the very LAST character you'd ever suspect of being evil reveals his true self.<br /><br /> In book 4, Harry is enrolled in the Triwizard Tournament, where three different magical schools select students to compete in daring, dangerous tests of school.  Harry also attends the Quidditch world cup with the Weasleys and has a frightening run in with Voldemort and his servant in a graveyard.  One character is tragically killed (I actually cried) at Voldemort's hand.<br /><br /> Book 4 is probably my favorite, along with 1, but there's really no such thing as a bad Harry Potter book.  The movies are fantastic as well, and the sixth book is due out in a few months.	2005-03-19

A woman named Ellen gives birth to a deformed, monstrous child with claws and she kills it, even though her husband, who's a barker at a carnival, loves it and doesn't understand how dangerous it is.  He nearly kills her when he finds out and tosses her out of the house.  Fast forward several years and Ellen has two new children of her own and a new life.  But she's turned into a religious fanatic, like Carrie's mother from Stephen King's first novel, and her children, espescially her son, are afraid of her.  And now her old husband Conrad is tracking down her children in an effort to destroy them as revenge.  Ellen's 17 year old daughter Amy and a few other dope-smoking rebels head out to the carnival for some fun and when they enter the Funhouse, where Conrad works, they get more than they bargained for.  Much more.	2005-03-19
US	21386251	R144G625UEFNCE	042518109X	567976695	Whispers	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Yet another winner!	Koontz seldom dissapoints.  I've finished Hideaway, Intensity, The Bad Place, The Funhouse, The Face Of Fear, The Door To December, and Whispers, and highly enjoyed every single one of them. <br /> <br /> Whispers is about a screenwriter living in LA named Hilary Thomas.  As a child she lived in a dumpy, tiny apartment with her alcoholic, abusive parents and she's been living the life of a loner when a man named Bruno Frye, whom she met while doing research on vineyards for a script, is found hiding in her house.  Well, turns out he's a bit of a nutcase.  He pursues her with a knife and tries to rape her and she chases him off and calls the police.  The police refuse to provide protection and he soon returns.  This time, she kills him before he can rape her.  Now, fast forward a few days and Bruno shows up in Hilary's house AGAIN.  He's somehow returned from the dead....or has he? <br /> <br /> At first Bruno comes off as a stereotypical bad guy.  But later on in the story, when you discover the truth about him and the horrible \\"whispers\\" that he hears upon awakening from nightmares, you may find yourself feeling some sympathy towards him and even the one who turned him into what he is today. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that, in the middle, one of the characters dies, and the scene literally moved me to tears.  The story started to drag a bit after that, but it picked up the pace after awhile.  <br /> <br /> Now I'm off to read Watchers and Lightning!	2005-03-18

It was his first novel, and you can tell by its sloppiness.  It hardly seems like the same author.  I had to force myself to press on at times and the whole pig farm scene was disgusting.  Those kids were truly dispicable, so much so that I was turned off.  It's just a VERY mediocre book compared to the likes of Misery, Rose Madder, Pet Sematary, and The Shining.  Outdated and overrated, and just not very good.	2005-03-09
US	21386251	RHFH620QV6AQG	042513525X	565346155	Hideaway	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Fantastic read!	After being a Stephen King fan for years and loving all that I had read, I decided to check out Dean Koontz, and Hideaway was my first.  At first I was dissapointed, trying to get used to this new style of writing.  It took me awhile to get into it, but when I did it hit HARD. <br /> <br /> Hatch and his wife are traveling during a snow storm and they end up in a terrible car accident, rolling the car down the side of a cliffand into a freezing river.  Hatch dies and after being worked on in the emergency room, is brought back to life after being dead for a record shattering amount of time.  After his accident, the couple begin to learn to love life and are having a great time, but they miss their son who died of cancer years ago and decide to adopt a child-a crippled, spunky girl named Regina.  She's lived a hard life of rejection and tries to turn them off by acting like a little brat, but she soon puts down her defenses and accepts their love and shows the sweet girl that she really is. <br /> <br /> But it seems that Hatch's time in the land of the dead has done something to his mind.  He's now seeing visions of murder and mayhem that terrify him and make him fear for his sanity.  And now a vicious young killer is aware of Hatch's presence and is determined to track him down and kill him and his family. <br /> <br /> The hellish setting at the amusement park was truly captivating, as was the killer's gruesome memory of pushing his friend off of an indoor roller coaster at a young age.  It really sends shivers up your spine.  The entire book was captivating as is the killer.  He's young, handsome, and eerily polite, but he's a crazed demon man. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's definetely one of my favorite books ever, an excellent introduction to Koontz, and I do look forward to reading it again.  Intensity was my favorite, though.	2005-03-04

It took me awhile to get into this, as was the case with the excellent Hideaway, but it was really a fantastic book.  A man wakes up in an alley and has no idea who he is or what he's doing there.  He has amnesia and hires a pair of married detectives, Julie and Bobby Dakota to help him find out who he is, where he goes at night when he wakes up with blood on his hands, mysterious gems in his pockets, or in a change of clothes that don't belong to him, and what evil supernatural force is after him.  It's one of the most clever and original books I've ever read, and a villian that you can kind of sympthasize with on some levels.	2005-03-04
US	21386251	R3VRO4WO4K9QOD	0451205421	835415534	The Door to December	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Seven long years of experimental torture and isolation	Nine year old Melanie was kidnapped by her own father at the age of three.  For several years her father kept her locked in the basement, undergoing scientific experiments to aid his research.  This involved being forced to sit in an electric chair to learn to block out pain and left for hours at a time in a sensory deprivation tank, and denied the chance to leave the basement or have any contact with the outside world.  After her father and his friends are brutally murdered, Melanie is found wandering the streets naked and deeply catatonic, terrified of what she calls \\"The Door To December\\".  It also seems that somebody is after the girl.  Now it's up to Melanie's mother, a policeman named Dan and a hired bodyguard named Earl to protect the autistic, troubled girl, discover who's behind the murders, who's after Melanie, and learn the truth about the mysterious \\"Door To December\\" that the girl is terrified of. <br /> <br /> It's not the greatest Dean Koontz book I've read (that honor is better left to Intensity), but it was highly enjoyable.  My only complaints are that we never get to see the girl heal, the attraction between Melanie's mother and Dan goes absoulutely nowhere as if Koontz forgot about it, and it's painfully obvious who the killer is.  I was, howeve, surprised by the meaning behind the whirlwind of flowers.	2005-03-04

It was quick and to the point, with little character development, and, in some ways, it's a nice change to see a book that gets right down to the chase relatively quickly.  The plot is simple: There's a serial killer on the loose dubbed \\"The Butcher\\".  Graham Harris is a clairvoyent who is helping the police solve the murders.  So The Butcher decides that it's time to take out this physcic b*stard that's spoiling all his fun.  Graham and his lover are working on the top floor of a skyscraper and The Butcher takes out the security guards, takes the elevator up, and a chase ensues.  Eventually, the realize that the only way out is by climbing down the side of the building.   <br /> <br /> The only problem?  It's practically a blizzard outside, they're 42 stories off the ground, and Graham is deathly afraid of heights after falling on a climb and ending up at the hospital. <br /> <br /> It's definetely more amateur than his other work, but still a good read.  If you think The Face Of Fear is good, wait until you try Intensity!  I also recommend Hideaway, The Bad Place, and The Door To December.  Those are the only others I've read.	2005-03-04

He's spanked her, bit her, cut her, threatened to kill her, raped her, and he even beat her baby girl out of her one night.  Nevertheless she stays with him until fourteen years later she realizes she has to run away while he's at work.  Just leave.  Fast.  She steals his bank card and takes a train to a city hundreds of miles away where she begins to rebuild and repair her life.  But Norman is searching for her.  Norman is furious.
