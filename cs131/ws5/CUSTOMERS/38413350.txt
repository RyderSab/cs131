His career as a cop ended when a terrorist bomb took off his leg and left his two partners dead, and now he's one of a rare breed in London - a private eye, tough, sarcastic, hard-boiled, and deaf in one ear, who lives off his wits and contacts in London's East End.

There is embroidery on the stamp, low or plain, white, in the satin stitch, darned, drawn, and damascene:  and there is guipure d'art lace, reticella, honiton, hollie point, barcelona, bedfordshire, brillante, belgian, etc.  Nor is knitting, knotting, netting, crocheting, braiding, crewel, needlepoint, applique, cord work, crepe work, frame work, canvas work, patchwork or any other of more than a dozen needlecrafts of one type only.  To each and every needlecraft belongs a multitude of stitches, which when combined form uniquely different patterns and when worked upon various materials produce entirely different effects.  <br /><BR>So many possibilities are there in fact that a veritable encyclopedia, devoted exclusively to the needlecraft arts, would be needed to record, define, describe and illustrate all the stitches, materials, patterns, methods and operations of each needlecraft.  Back in the 1880's just such a comprehensive collection was achieved in the work of Caulifeild and Saward, and not in the near century since its publication has another fuller, more accurate work supplanted it. <br /><BR>Including every needlecraft from ordinary sewing to the most intricate pillow lace or church embroidery and from a wide range of cultures - contemporary Victorian British, ancient Egyptian, traditional continental, Oriental, Greek, Venetian, Spanish, Moorish etc. - this book is equally valuable to the practitioner and the collector.  In addition to full and precise descriptions of stitches, explanations of techniques, definitions of terms, identifications of materials, specific projects with detailed stitching information, step-by-step instructions for patterns, more than 800 figures illustrating the text, and a supplementary section of 159 plates depicting nearly 550 objects to be made, there is much material of specific interest to the antiquarian, pertaining to the history and ethnography ofindividual needlework techniques and designs. <br />	2003-09-29

The Mountain Artisans Quilting Book is the best book on the contemporary adaptation of the old craft of quilting.  It is a basic instructional book combining Alfred Allen Lewis's lucid instructions with the Coty-Award-winning designs created by Dorothy Weatherford for the Mountain Artisans.  At the same time, it tells the heart-warming story of the Mountain Artisans: how the famous West Virginia cooperative was started by a group of idealistic young women, among them Sharon Percy Rockefeller;  how their efforts to market the products of a centuries old craft overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles to achieve national recognition and the highest accolade of all, the Coty Award.<br /><BR>The how-to-do-it sections of the book feature photographic step-by-step instructions on: traditional patchwork patterns, stitching, applique, hemming, binding, tufting, basting, tracing, design placement, bordering, quilting; application of the handicraft to making toys, pillows, clothing and placemats; new approaches to design, with helpful hints on color and placement that will enable the reader to make original designs.<br /><BR>In addition to a detailed explanation of the new techniques developed by the Mountain Artisans, the book features an investigation of the traditional methods of making the old quilts and patchworks, examples of which have found their way into great museum collections.	2003-09-28

Of special interest to many collectors today are the boldly colored, handsomeely quilted bedcovers made by the Amish women in Pennsylvania - particularyly Lancaster County - and in the Amish communities of Ohio and Indiana.<br /><BR>These old Amish quilts have a dual appeal - their visual impact and their superior craftsmanship.  Some students of modern art are drawn to them because their abstract geometric designs are strikingly parallel to the paintings of several contemporary artists.  Other collectors treasure these quilts for their intricate, refined handiwork and their minute stitches.  What is amazing, and worth exploring in this handsome book, is how the Amish women, with a limited range of materials and with limited exposure to the tastes and patterns of the &quot;outside&quot; world, have created enduring works of art that are visually exciting and sophisticated.<br /><BR>A Gallery of Amish Quilts presents for the study and enjoyment of all 150 Amish quilts in color, together with splendid balack and white photographs of the Amish people and countryside.  Also, a comprehensive introduction gives the cultural and aesthetic background for the fuller enjoyment of these beautiful quilts.<br />	2003-09-28
