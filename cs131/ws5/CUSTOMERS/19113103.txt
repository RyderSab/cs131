The equally famous jewellery and accessories which are an essential part of the Chanel style have also been included in the book. <br />I can't imagine any fan of Chanel being disappointed with this book.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-02

Unfortunately the quality of the illustrations was extremely disappointing.  The dolls looked as if the illustrator traced their images from photos of statues, reliefs, portraits, etc. Also, the quality of the paper was poor and printed on both sides, so by cutting out the dolls one would cut up the text on the reverse page. I wish I'd read the other customers' reviews before purchasing this book, because in the publisher's product description there wasn't a single mention of the fact that this was a coloring book.	2005-05-18

Most of the dolls did not have additional costumes and those that do, had only one extra costume each.  The greatest disappointment of all was the Marie Antoinette doll (which didn't resemble the queen), and her costumes (they looked like dresses one would see on the ugly sisters in a Cinderella pantomime).  It's a pity her costumes weren't based on actual gowns she wore in portraits.	2005-05-18

Tom Tierney has captured the period with beautifully rendered portraits of Henry VIII and his wives. <br />I did feel however, that the doll of Anne Boleyn didn't resemble any of her extant portraits, and some of the costumes were not based on paintings of the time, but were instead invented by the artist (eg Anne of Cleves's German costume, Catherine Parr's green gown).	2005-05-06

The illustrations were not up to his usual standard.  The only accurate portrayals were of Juliette Binoche and Capucine.  The Leslie Caron, Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Adjani dolls bore no resemblance to the actresses whatsoever, and the others weren't that great either.<br /><br />It was also strange that one of the greatest stars of French cinema, Arletty, was not included while a relative newcomer like Audrey Tautou was.<br /><br />There was also an odd note in the text saying that Capucine and Audrey Hepburn became friends before they were famous, when both had been house models for Givenchy.  Audrey Hepburn met Givenchy when she approached him to supply costumes for \\"Sabrina\\".  She was never his house model.  It makes me wonder how accurate the notes about the other actresses were.	2005-05-04

There is also information about the designers who worked for the house after Dior's death, Yves Saint-Laurent and Marc Bohan. <br />What I didn't like about the book is that there are a number of close up photos of gowns.

The illustrations are colorful and detailed, and the portrayal of Worth himself is excellent. <br />One of the dolls is Worth's wife (and first model), Marie Vernet, which was a lovely gesture.  The dolls are accompanied by a variety of supporting garments (mainly bustles), which were needed to achieve the changing silhouettes of the late nineteenth century. <br />The selection of costumes is good but a little haphazard.  I would have preferred the inclusion of one design for every year or two so as to ensure a smoother chronological flow. <br />Also, not enough credit is given in the text to Worth's succesor, his son Jean-Philippe who started designing for the house in 1874.  Well before Charles Frederick died in 1895, it was Jean-Philippe who designed the bulk of the collections.	2005-04-20

The illustrations are good, but not of the same standard as his other fashion paper dolls. <br />There are more misses than hits in the selection of outfits.  The suede blouson with flowing skirt by Donna Karan and the floral, ruffled dress by Unagro are two of the (very few)highlights. <br />There are a number of designs which are neither typical of the decade nor of the specific designer's work.  Lacroix was at the forefront of the extravagant, colorful \\"conspicuous consumption\\" trend, yet his work is represented by a dull grey suit.  The designer renowned for his architectural tailoring, Claude Montana, is represented by an odd dress and pants ensemble in violet, yellow and blue.  Yves Saint-Laurent was hugely influential in the first half of the decade, but you wouldn't know it judging by this book.  These are just three examples of the flaws in selection of designs for this book. <br />Buy it if you collect Tom Tierney's paper dolls, but don't expect too much.	2005-04-20

The styles of the thirties and forties are represented in this book, as are the famous Russian and Chinese designs by Yves-Saint Laurent.<br /><br />The decade ended with a move toward more imposing almost futuristic styles, and these are well represented by outfits by Mugler and Montana.<br /><br />My reason for not giving this book 5 stars is that the illustrations are not up to Tom Tierney's usual standard.

There were a number of pieces from labels which were not influential during the era (Adolfo, Nina Ricci, Arnold Scaasi, Bob Mackie, etc).  Also, some designers were represented by dresses which were not the best examples of their respective styles (Versace, Gaultier, Alexander McQueen for Givenchy).<br /><br />One of the few highlights was a beaded cloak by Galliano for Dior.

I think the best likenesses were those of Liliuokalani and Princess Grace (somewhat different from \\"Grace Kelly Paper Dolls\\"), although Eleanor of Aquaitaine looks a bit like a store mannequin.  The best costumes are those of Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette, Josephine and Princess Grace's wedding dress. <br />One of the reasons I didn't give this book 5 stars is that not all dolls are drawn in the same scale which is a little distracting when turning the pages (Elizabeth I is especially small).  Another reason is the decision to portray a number of the women in profile, which gives them less character (the doll of Cleopatra being an exception).  Finally, Maria Theresa of Austria was a glaring omission. <br />If you want to introduce your child to history as it was, not dressed up to suit your own morality, buy this book.

The dolls and costumes are drawn in great detail.  One can see the change in style from flowing, soft gowns of the early thirties to the sharper tailoring and increasing extravagance of the late thirties.  Mr Tierney has intentionally drawn the dolls to resemble Gloria Swanson and Joan Crawford (with blonde hair?), which was a great idea as it lends more authenticity to the look of the dolls.  However, Gloria Swanson's popularity was already on descent by this time, so I think that another star would have been more suitable to represent the early thirties.	2005-04-15

He has beautifully traced the development of fashion during the course of the twenties.  Included are sportswear, elegant daywear, sumptuous evening gowns and a fabulous wedding dress by Worth.  My favorites were the fur wrap over a drop waisted dress by Louiseboulanger, a look often seen in photos of film stars of the era, and the Egyptian gown fit for a vamp like Theda Bara.  I also like the resemblance of one of the dolls to Mae Murray as it adds a touch of authenticity.	2005-04-15

The illustrations are evocative of the lives of fashionable women 100 years ago. <br />I especially liked the dolls themselves, clad in faithful depictions of the underwear of the era. <br />The selection of costumes is superb.  It is clear to see the development of women's dress from 1899 until 1919, from heavily corseted hourglass figures laden with ruffles, lace and embroidery, to the fantasies of the early teens and finally the simplification of dress leading up to the 1920-s.	2005-04-15

The dolls portray two of Dior's favorite models, Renee and Lisa, and are drawn wearing typical post war foundation garments.  A touching detail is that each doll holds a sprig of lilies of the valley, Dior's favorite flower. <br />All of the designer's \\"lines\\" are covered with a selection of outfits for every occasion, including two magnificent ballgowns. <br />I haven't given this book 5 stars for two reasons.  The first is that some of the designs are depicted in inaccurate colors.  The artist has used pastels to replace original colors of grey or navy.  The second reason is that the names given by Dior to each individual ensemble have not been included in the text (eg the 1947 shantung jacket and pleated black skirt was called \\"Bar\\", the petal skirted ballgown was called \\"Junon\\", etc).	2005-04-15

Many fashion historians give the impression that YSL influence faded by the end of the 1970-s, but he was in fact instrumental in creating the look of the 1980-s.  Tom Tierney's book reinforces this erroneous impression by featuring very few designs dated after 1979. <br />One final note:  doll two is clothed in a flesh colored body stocking which was supposedly worn under transparent clothes.  Yves Saint-Laurent never gave his models body stockings to wear under mousseline dresses as such false modesty would defeat the purpose of celebrating a beautiful body.	2005-04-13

It is about time that someone has paid tribute to these largely forgotten ladies.  They were outfitted in the most extravagant costumes and some, like Barbara La Marr and Clara Bow, led lives which perpetuated their screen images.  Tom Tierney has done a wonderful job of capturing the era.<br /><br />The notes accompanying the dolls could be improved, however.  For example, there is no mention of the films Louise Brooks made in Germany, which were her greatest successes.<br /><br />I'd love to see entire books dedicated to some of these ladies, especially Marlene Dietrich and Myrna Loy.<br /><br />A note to the artist:  the beaded suit worn by Marlene Dietrich in \\"Angel\\" was biege and encrusted with paste rubies, emeralds and rhinestones.  It still exists and colour photos of it are featured in a couple of books about the history of Hollywood costume design.	2005-04-13

The book is clearly aimed at adult customers, whether they be Garbo fans, paper doll enthusiasts or students of costume design. <br />As someone who fits into all three categories, I loved the portrayal of Garbo.  There are three dolls showing her at different times during her career, and the first two in particular are very life-like.  I also enjoyed seeing the development and growing sophistication of costume design from the silent era until the early 1940-s.  The costumes from \\"Mata Hari\\" and \\"Camille\\" are especially lovely. <br />My only complaint is a small one.  I would have liked to see more than just one costume each from two of Garbo's greatest roles:  \\"Queen Christina\\" and \\"Anna Karenina\\".	2005-04-13

All of the actresses are faithfully portrayed by the artist. <br />Unfortunately, as with the previous book in the series, Mr Tierney seems to have drawn the costumes from memory.  The colors and details are wrong in several costumes, most notably the historical ones (\\"Emma\\", \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", \\"The Portrait of a Lady\\", etc). <br />Paper doll enthusiasts and people expecting an accurate record of film costumes of the eighties will be disappointed, but children who want a paper doll of their favorite star to play with, might find this book worthwhile.	2005-04-13

Stars like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn had careers that spanned greater periods (so they should be honored by books of their own), whereas most of those featured were more typical of the era.  This is especially true of Maria Montez who specialized in the fantasy film genre that was popular during World War II, and Veronica Lake, whose hairstyle was as influential at the time as Princess Diana's was in the eighties.  The portrayals of Hedy Lamarr and Dorothy Lamour were wonderful, but I feel that the quality of illustration for some of the costumes was not of the same standard.	2005-04-13

For a collection of paper dolls titled \\"Glamorous Movies Stars of the Eighties\\", this book greatly disappoints.  The big names of the decade are here, Geena Davis, Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Dolly Parton, etc, and all are well portrayed by Tom Tierney.  However, the costumes he has illustrated are rarely glamorous.  Sweatshirt and jeans, tee-shirt and jeans, a man's shirt on a woman, dowdy dresses, etc, are the opposite of glamorous. <br />OK, so the artist chose the featured actresses's most famous roles, but who wants a paper doll dressed as if she's doing the spring cleaning? <br />The other really disappointing feature of these illustrations is that many of the costumes are inaccurate.  The colors and details are wrong (eg the two gowns from \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" and the mermaid costume from \\"Splash\\", among others).  It seems as if the artist worked from memory instead of having photos of the costumes before him while drawing them. <br />If you want truly glamorous paper dolls, there are many others by Tom Tierney which actually fit the description.

The abrupt change from wartime to the New Look is well depicted. <br />I especially loved the inclusion of the WAC and Navy Nurse Corps uniforms. <br />My reason for not rating this book a full 5 stars is that the 3 outfits by Dior have been inaccurately drawn (I'm a huge Dior fan, so I am familiar with photos of his designs).  Also, Dior introduced the layered tulle ballgown in the spring 1947 collection, a design that had a huge impact on evening wear for the following decade, yet this type of gown is not included in this work.	2005-04-11

As is expected from Mr Tierney, the pieces are beautifully rendered and we are reminded of the time when costumes played a starring role in movies.<br /><br />A few aspects of this work lowered my overall rating of its quality.  Firstly, the rather odd concept was off-putting, that is, two dolls who serve as supports for costumes with detachable heads portraying the stars who wore them.  Secondly, some of the heads don't look at all like the actresses in question, most notably Katharine Hepburn (the head actually looks like Raquel Welch), Marlene Dietrich and Rita Hayworth.  Finally, some costumes have appeared in other works by Mr Tierney.  Given the wealth of Hollywood costumes to choose from, there was no need for repetition.<br /><br />That aside, there are some delightful illustrations.  I especially liked the amusing portrayal of Jack Lemmon in \\"Some Like It Hot\\".  The red gown from \\"Jezebel\\", the wedding dress from \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" and the draped dress with a fur stole from \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" were also outstanding.	2005-04-07

The ostrich feather gown from \\"Top Hat\\" and the Scottish outfits from \\"The Barkleys of Broadway\\", stand out. <br /> <br />The second part of this work is less effective, probably because the costumes portrayed aren't as glamorous.

The glamour of the era is revived in all its splendour.  Most of the costumes worn by Louis XIV in portraits are faithfully recreated by Mr Tierney.  My reason for not giving this work 5 stars is that some details of this work were \\"not quite right\\".  For example, one of the dolls is the Duchesse de Ventadour, when other figures played far greater roles in the Sun King's court but have not been included (eg the King's brother, Philippe, Duc d'Orleans and his second wife, Elisabeth von der Pfalz).  Another reason is that some costumes don't seem to have been based on actual portraits, but were invented by Tom Tierney (eg the green and yellow dress of the Duchesse de Fontanges).  Finally, in the text the ladies of the court are referred to by their titles not their full names.  I think that names are essential when including short biographies of the people included in the book.  Visually, this book is splendid, but it would not please historians who expect complete accuracy.	2005-04-03

Ever since I was a child I have loved old Hollywood movies because of the marvellous costumes worn by the actresses, so one can imagine how pleased I was to discover this collection of paper dolls.  There is a wonderful simplicity about these dolls and the costumes are accurately rendered.  This work (being one of Mr Tierney's earliest) is more graphic and two dimensional in appearance than his later work, and for me that is what gives it more impact and charm.  I have seen these plates framed as prints, and they are truly of a quality that is worthy of framing.  A note to the artist, the sequinned gown worn by Joan Crawford in \\"The Women\\" was gold not red (source:  \\"Gowns by Adrian\\").	2005-03-15

I especially loved Elizabeth Taylor in her famous silk slip from \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\".  She was at her most stunning in that film and the doll captures her beauty perfectly.<br /><br />From the point of view of a paper doll enthusiast, I was disappointed that most of the dolls are fully clothed so that only their faces show through a hole in the costume.  As a child I used to add costumes to my Marilyn Monroe paper doll by Mr Tierney, and it was a great way to improve my fashion illustration skills.  Unfortunately, any budding illustrator today won't be able to do the same with the dolls in this book (eg Audrey Hepburn, Susan Hayward, Jane Russell, etc).<br /><br />Also, I'd love to see whole books dedicated to two of the greatest stars featured in this collection:  Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor.<br /><br />This is a lovely set of illustrations, but as far as paper dolls go, I preferred Marilyn Monroe, Galmorous Movies Stars of the Thirties and Glamorous Movie Stars of the Forties.	2005-03-15

As always Mr Tierney's drawings are of the highest standard, and I especially liked the striking Latin features of the dolls.  Unfortunately the lack of accuracy lets this collection down.  A Balenciaga creation is credited to Pertegaz, some costumes are incorrectly dated, and Gianni Versace's work is represented by a costume design for an opera, when this is supposed to be a collection of fashion designs.  A number of outfits aren't typical of the particular designer's work (eg Gigli, Ferre, Fontana, etc).  Most puzzling of all is the inclusion of people whose ethnic descent is either Spanish or Italian, but their careers and businesses were established in other countries (eg Emanuel Ungaro, John Galliano, Elsa Schiaparelli, Nina Ricci, to name a few.  Even Oscar de la Renta, an American designer born in the Dominican Republic is included!).  Mr Tierney is still a great graphic artist, but his research has let him down in this instance.	2005-03-15

Firstly, the doll itself bears no resemblance to the extant portraits of Marie Antoinette.  In fact, the doll and a gown(plate 4) look as if they were based on a portrait of Madame de Pompadour.  Marie Antoinette would not have been amused!<br />Secondly, a few costumes would have been more at home in a Jeanette MacDonald musical than in the eighteenth century (most notably plates 4 & 15).<br />That said, I loved the costumes which were based on ones Marie Antoinette wore in extant portraits (although for some reason, the artist has changed the colours of some of them).<br />Having been a fan of Tom Tierney's work for many years, as well as someone who is fascinated with the eighteenth century, I expected more from this publication.	2005-03-09
