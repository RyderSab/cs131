It's a great piece of putting the finger on annoying things for all those thinking their \\"science\\" (be it hard, soft, or anything in-between) is objective. Through various fields like psychology, language, maths and physics, the author is showing how their members try to escape turning back at what they're actually doing. The author discusses those unshakable certainties people in those fields don't want to have a look at simply because they would have to recognize they don't know what they're doing.<br /><br />Science (nor any experimental field) never asked for being considered as anything close to Truth, it's human subjectivity which is trying to impose their beliefs on reality. Reality never asked for being considered as true or false, it is what it is, period.	2005-10-06

(Science Essentials)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Molding the brain	This book reviews the state-of-the-art in brain development and on the factors driving its state. The author's viewpoint is the one of a neurocientist, hence more centered on neuronal molding than on learning. The author shows that what we call brain development is actually about partially limiting the adaptivity of the brain circuitry. Still, there is always potential for adaptation, age does not prevent the molding of the brain. The evolution of the brain is driven both by genetics and learning. So how we use it matters a lot! Saying that one is too old to change is just an excuse.	2005-09-27

It's interesting though, as it presents the Jewish viewpoint in a \\"theosophical\\"-like style. Its interest however lies mainly in comparing the cosmological view of the Kabbalah with other traditions. If your interest goes beyond factual aspects (suppose you'd like to get some experience) i would not recommend this one.

The book starts with a little of history about psychology, giving the reader enough context to build up a critical view of psychology. Throughout the book, the author tries to disentangle many biases in psychology and psychiatry to show that madness is not that bad, and that many behaviors we take as common are very close to that. The book is quite long and involved, i think it is its main drawback. However, it is worth reading as it provides a lot of examples of everyday behaviors that might easily lead to some form of madness. Personally, i cannot consider madness as being anything else tham simply a \\"socially annoying\\" thing. People considered as \\"mad\\" are sometimes less mad than supposedly normal persons, most people just don't want to try to understand them.	2005-01-18

James does a fairly good job at<br /><br />presenting an objective account of religious experience. W. James<br /><br />tries to present experience as it is: subjective. So basically W.<br /><br />James provides here factual accounts to various aspects involved<br /><br />with the subjectivity of religious experience. W. James judges not<br /><br />what he sees, but tries to understand and explain from the<br /><br />standpoint of psychology to which type of subjective phenomenon<br /><br />each experience can be seen to belong, without partiality in his<br /><br />classification. So the interest of such a book is to give the<br /><br />reader an opportunity to undo some of his personal beliefs about<br /><br />religion, as we too often hear that \\"religion transcends the realm<br /><br />of usual experience\\" so that nobody would be allowed to say<br /><br />anything about it.

The beginning of the title (\\"What is Life\\") sounds like if Schrodinger can claim anything about the difference between mind and matter as a pure consequence of physics. Too bad, as the rest of the title might make you think that there will be some discussion about why and whether there might be a difference between mind and matter.

There is in addition the purely sound-related aspect of reality. All words, thoughts, and emotions, carry on some power due to their vibratory nature. Everything, whatever it is can be seen as a wave. So don't think it is just about what you hear. All there is can be described in that way.<br /><br />This book is of interest not for its esoteric nature, but rather to give the reader an intuition of what mystics perceive of reality, which is everything but magic. Science is currently concerned with a part of reality, namely those frequencies that can be detected and thus measured through physical (material) instruments. But the vibratory nature of the world goes beyond that. You as humans have access to more than the physical realm (mental, emotional, and let's say \\"spiritual\\" to give a rough picture). This books hints at those aspects captured by the concept of \\"sound\\", that are of utmost importance for all humans to uncover the possibilities life has given them. Everything you think, say or feel has an impact on you and your surroundings, so reading this book can help you to realize how important every single event of our life has, through its wave-like aspect. This book is about your very life.	2004-12-12

Most of the examples and works that support the viewpoint<br /><br />of the authors seem to me quite ok, but the authors probably did<br /><br />not read them thoroughly because they left much of their depth<br /><br />untouched.

Many of us do not have a problem in thinking about an external God, but having to confront yourself with the idea that God lies within yourself too, this seems to be disturbing for human kind. The first part of the book on the \\"ten illusions\\" is aimed at showing you that many of your beliefs are logically inconsistent (not to speak about what they could be subjectively...). This first part should at least lead you to acknowledge the possibility of an all-pervading God. The second part on how to deal with these \\"ten illusions\\" to reduce their impact and even suppress them, at least to see them as illusions instead of thinking they are real. Finally, the third part provides a broader perspective on what has been said before to make you start the journey back to God, or back to yourself, which is exactly the same thing.<br /><br />Comments<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />The \\"ten illusions\\" as presented here give a really good account on what many humans think is true and that they never questioned. The way the author presents these ten illusions is not focibly the best way, it is just one way to present some viewpoint. However, i think that the author has made an excellent job in presenting these \\"illusions\\", and this book could hence be very useful for the reader if she/he uses it as a tool to reconsider her/his beliefs about God and reality. Even though the way in which the presentation of the \\"ten illusions\\" is made can be questioned (everything can be questioned), i cannot find any fault in the statements of this book, so i consider it quite highly compared to most other \\"spiritually-minded\\" ones available.<br /><br />Note<br /><br />-------<br /><br />This book is not meant at convincing you about anything, it is up to you to convince yourself about something, and you are the only one able to so. So if you pick up this book and want to get the full benefit of it, read it as it were coming from yourself and for yourself, not from some author to some reader. This is what introspection is about, it is between you and you. Reading something and being left afterwards only with a judgment (i liked it or not) is useless for your life. Reading is about living an experience, you are doing that for you only, not for me. If you do not live your reading, better do something else that you'll really live in full. The author does not get any benefit for himself except the money he potentially earns by you buying it.ant to get the full benefit of it, read it as it were coming from yourself and for yourself, not from some author to some reader.

This personal experience of Gopi Krishna should warn everyone that this is no game. Kundalini is a terrific energy lying within the \\"body\\" (not just the physical one) that sustains one's body at different levels (physical, emotional, spiritual). Did you ever wondered what happens when one tries to unleash the energy contained in atoms ? Kundalini is similar, in that awakening this energy source leads to chain reactions like nuclear power. Kundalini will have effects on all aspects of your life. If you do not know the purpose of awakening the Kundalini, then it means you are not ready to play that game. If you know what you are doing (i.e. are already spiritually awake and know that the end in itself is not to obtain anything) then it's not a problem, and in that case Kundalini will awaken by itself even without you being aware of it.<br /><br />Still, if you want to play with chakras and Kundalini, then be prepared as this book gives you an example of what may happen.	2004-09-09

Ornstein here provides in this concise book arguments in favour of the multi-faceted working of the mind. If something can be called \\"mind\\", then it must be realized that several minds (functions) work throughout the brain. There is no single entity that can be called the \\"mind\\" as several processes work in parallel and contend for a higher-layer, call it consciousness, soul or whatever. Using recent works in psychology, Ornstein demonstrates that no single entity can cover the different, and even inconsistent aspects that underlie our human behavior.	2004-08-18

As neither pure science nor pure spirituality can cover the whole spectrum of the human subjectivity field, both are required to understand the nature and the working of the human mind. Science analyzes, reasons, and is limited by its very rationality and consistency requirements. Any single-minded spirituality on the other hand cannot capture the whole range of possible subjective approaches of reality as seen by every human being. Overall, this book provides quite interesting insight and experience as seen from a professional psychologist who is deeply interested in understanding the mind, not just describing as are most blind scientists.	2004-08-18

Consciousness is not just about the brain, or thoughts, or some spiritual way of seeing life, but it emcompasses everything, what we are and what we live.<br /><br />Ornstein shows quite well that the scientific viewpoint is too limited and focused in purpose to broadly explain consciousness. By choosing to deal with the subjective aspects of consciousness, Ornstein provides a full account of the aspects of consciousness that are necessary to improve our understanding of it. To understand consciousness it is necessary to deal with aspects linked to culture, psychology, and education, but also to more experiential (some will say less scientific, more subjective, personal) aspects that cannot be communicated but are equally important to know what consciousness is about.<br /><br />As pointed out by another reviewer, the second part that deals with non-scientific aspects of consciousness is not well organized. Furthermore, it is largely centered on the Sufi viewpoint. Other eastern philosophies and religions have a lot to say about consciousness and are not treated in this book. But this view of consciousness is mostly subjective and does not fit very well any organization, so i don't think this is a problem. The choice of the Sufi spiritual tradition does seem a good choice to me as Sufism is not really embedded in a particular culture (although some might argue it is grounded on Islam, this point is not relevant as Sufism goes beyond any conception of life or any religious tradition).<br /><br />I think that this book does a fair job at linking scientific with non-scientific aspects of consciousness. This topic is certainly important for human kind to develop a less dogmatic view of what we are and why. Science is good to answer the \\"what\\" question, while religion, philosophy and spitirual practice tackle the \\"why\\" answer.question, while religion, philosophy and spitirual practice tackle the \\"why\\" answer.	2004-08-17

The first part on numerology and chakras is well written and provides relatively unbiased information. Parts 2, 3 and 4 on the other hand stand a little behind the first part as neither Yoga nor Kundalini can be limited to Hatha Yoga, the purely physical part of Yoga most people understand of Yoga.<br /><br />As correctly stated in part one, the purpose of awakening the Kundalini is not a question related to the physical plane, its purpose is to awaken another level of consciousness within. It's a spiritual issue. Awakening the Kundalini should not be done unless your spiritual consciousness rises at the same time. One should not try to raise the Kundalini without being correctly prepared to it (on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual planes), as it might be harmful. Playing with a tool one does not understand is dangerous.<br /><br />Parts 3, 4 and 5 still provide useful information to start Yoga and meditation, but the book is not sufficiently self-contained to properly tackle Hatha Yoga.<br /><br />So i'm rating this book 3 stars because of the lack of consistency between the first part that focuses on the spiritual and consciousness aspects, while the rest is too much focused on Hatha Yoga but without properly explaining the how's and why's. So either this book was aimed at being a compromise between the hidden and actual purpose of Yoga and the physical part of it (Hatha Yoga), or its authors do not understand Yoga as a whole.	2004-07-23

As for all spiritual messages, the way one feels towards some message only reflects what one has found in it compared to one expected from finding in it. Everything already lies within yourself, so reading is just like a mirror that reflects what lies within you, but through the help of someone else's experience. If you're open to another way of seeing the world, you'll find something in these books. If you're not ready to try to understand the writer's viewpoint, then it is better not to open these books, and this is true for anything you read, be it spiritual, religious, philosophy, scientific,...<br />Living is an internal experience, the outside world is what you want it to be. If you take it as a friend and teacher, you'll learn from it, if seen as an enemy, then you'll have to fight. It is up to you to decide which way you want to go. Are you ready to accept the viewpoint of others or do you think you already hold the truth ?<br />To make things clear, these books (vols. I and II) provide a nice perspective on the nature of reality, by insisting on the geometrical nature of the world and the relationships between several planes of reality.

In this one, Holzmann provides examples of protocols that look really simple while proving their correctness is utterly difficult.

These volumes render quite well the early schisms that emerged from the various understandings and interpretations of the followers of what one could call &quot;the original Buddhist teachings&quot; (which we have almost no chance to know what they really were). Buddhism is really that : a bunch of different and sometimes contradictory schisms that each show the particular biases of the members of each schism. However, being aware that the goal of Buddhism should not depend on the means to attain it, one should use his intelligence to determine what statement is due to the misbeliefs or assumptions of each schism to understand its purpose. Don't think that consistency is a good  criterion to judge philosophy, scholarly accounts rely on scientific beliefs of consistency and logical thinking. Philosophy transcends such petty intellectual biases modern scientific thinking takes as true.<br />These two volumes coupled with the volumes edited by Bhikkhu Boddhi (Middle-length, long and connected discourses of the Buddha published by Wisdom books) will provide you with everything you need to undertand what Buddhism is about.

One is not a philosopher by great discourses, the way one lives shows one's understanding. Modern philosophers talk a lot but do not seem to be able to apply what they say on themselves. Such philosophers only appear to be philosophers, but they are not. Don't be mislead by scholarly accomplishments, these are worth nothing.<br />This volume goes very deep into Samkhya, a must-read. Excellent work Karl.	2003-06-08

Do not expect a fine philosophical analysis from these volumes, the focus on historical representativeness does not leave enough time to discuss anything else than the main points. One cannot summarize the Indian philosophy over such a large period of time without leaving untouched some important aspects.<br />The contribution of these volumes however remains the focus on showing what are the holes in our knowledge of the Indian philosophy from a scientific viewpoint. This contribution is extremely valuable to counter-balance the many misbeliefs Western as well as Eastern scholars might have concerning this tremedous Indian &quot;heritage&quot; which largely remains to be discovered. A must-read for all scholars wishing to gain a more accurate picture of the development of Indian philosophy.	2003-06-08

Advaita Vedanta is rather spiritual and religious than philosophical in purpose. Advaita is not to be analyzed from a philosophical perspective. This leaves an impression that these scholars have not understood the content of Advaita when reading it (have they really read it ?). If one reads the Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Advaita texts, one will soon realize that the stories they contain have not just a moral purpose. Their intent concerns the reader, not just ontological aspects as in philosophy but consequences on everyone's life. The purpose is not about trying to win arguments by word jugglery, but to provide spiritual insight for the reader. So i think that this volume misses largely its point, by restricting Advaita to what it is not intended to be. Rather read the non-scholarly works available everywhere than this volume.	2003-06-08

The grammarians show quite well how deeply linguistics and philosophy was tackled by Indian scholars centuries ago, illustrating the incredible advanced state of Indian philosophical and ontological knowledge compared to other parts of the world. The influence of the grammarians on the other branches of Indian philosophy cannot be over-emphasized. The name of &quot;grammarian&quot; is misleading because it goes farther than that, Indian linguists had an impressively good knowledge of language, both in syntax and semantics, maybe even better than linguists think to have nowadays.<br />A must-read !	2003-06-08

I would rather recommmend for a person not used to meta-heuristics and optimization to first go to the book by Kennedy. Only if one is interested in using swarm for solving real optimization problems reading this one is a good idea.<br />This book illustrates several features of swarm behavior that can be leveraged for optimization.

The treatment it provides is certainly of an acceptable  level, but it is too short to provide a deep understanding of how genetic algorithms work. If you want to understand how GAs work, Goldberg is THE place where to start. The code there is in Pascal, but frankly i don't see the advantage of Java for coding evolutionary algorithms for the first time. Maybe only after one has mastered the internals of genetic algorithms one can go to Java for advanced evolutionary algorithms for more complex tasks. One has first to understand well how data structures and operators work with a rather low-level language (C or C++), and then use Java for higher-level  algorithms.<br />So although the content of this book is not bad at all, i'm not sure it's well-suited for newcomers, and for advanced people the material is too simple for bringing something new. The only contribution of this book from my viewpoint is the large number of websites where evolutionary code is available.	2003-05-29

These are not the standard technical proceedings whose intended audience are specialists in the field, anyone with a basic knowledge of evolutionary computation can understand these papers. The proceedings begin with short tutorials explaining what EMO is and after that about the first half deals with more theoretical aspects while the second part with applications.<br />Reading these proceedings like a book is feasible (you may skip some papers you're not interested in) and most of the papers are very well written, so if you're interested in recent advances in EMO, reading these proceedings is almost required. The book by Kalyanmoy Deb (Multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms) is nice but does not provide enough treatment from an applications perspective, but it constitutes a nice textbook to enter the subject of EMO anyway.<br />Both EMO2001 and 2003 proceedings are &quot;must-read&quot; in evolutionary multi-objective optimization !	2003-05-29

While i do not deny the contribution at providing a more or less complete treatment of neurofuzzy techniques for data modeling, i'm still wondering where the non-theoretical chapters dealing with how to cope with real data with these techniques are hidden. The few examples in the book are mostly artificial and very limited in their scope. i'm not sure people dealing with data have an interest at reading this book, it's more about neurofuzzy techniques than data modelling.<br />The book edited by Schwefel, Weneger and Weinert entitled &quot;Advances in computational intelligence&quot; published by Springer emphasizes a lot more on fuzzy techniques based on real data although it does not discuss the &quot;neuro&quot; part of &quot;neuro-fuzzy&quot; techniques.<br />Still this book is not bad from a theoretical neuro-fuzzy perspective, but since these techniques are aimed at dealing with real data, i would have hoped a much better treatment of the practical aspects, which it fails to provide.	2003-05-26

It merely summarizes the existing work on multifractals without providing much insight about why is multifractal theory interesting in practice. If you are interested in a very good mathematical treatment go to the homepage of Rudolf Riedi at Rice University and read his papers. For the original ideas about multifractals and a far more applied perspective go to Mandelbrot's books and also &quot;Critical phenomena in natural sciences&quot; by Sornette, you'll get a more balanced theory-practice mix than in the present book. The only merit of this book is to reference quite fairly the existing literature, but this should not be the sole aim of a book, so i think that with this one you'll waste your time.	2003-05-26

Chatfield being a statistician focuses on his preferred audience, but all scientists having to analyze data, no matter what the objective is, should read this book. Data analysis is an art that deserves that one spends some serious time on thinking about methodology. This book is short, easy to read, and will provide you with a fresh view about what data analysis should be.<br />It is divided into three parts :<br />- first a pragmatic discussion of all aspects of data analysis as problem solving,<br />- then the second part deals with exercices aimed at showing the &quot;artistic&quot; nature of data analysis,<br />- and finally a refresher in statistics along with pragmatic comments.<br />Both the statistician and the scientist will benefit from all three parts.	2003-05-18

This second volume on the other hand aims at introducing the reader to more practical aspects of evolutionary computation.<br />While i found the first volume great, this second volume lacked the details that are required to provide an intuition of the working of advanced evolutionary techniques. I feel that &quot;How to solve it&quot; by Michalewicz and Fogel and &quot;Genetic algorithms + data structures = evolution programs&quot; by Michalewicz both provide this  experience useful to implement evolutionary techniques, by not trying to trade-off pages for understandability.<br />I would not recommend this book because it tries to introduce advanced aspects that are too difficult to cover in a single chapter each. If you really want to understand the practice of evolutionary techniques, you need a good intuition of how the various operators and structures work on real problems, just reading a few pages will not do the job.	2003-05-12

This volume contains most of the stories told in the Buddhist Teachings. Many examples seen in this volume can also be found in the Teachings of the Buddha Gotama. Brahman is explained through symbols like the &quot;elements&quot; (air, fire,...), objects for meditation, short stories that also appear in the Buddhist literature. However, these examples and stories are explained in a rather crude manner in this volume, compared to what can be found in the Buddhist Teachings. The advantage being that they are presented in a condensed manner here, with the most profound ones in this single volume...<br />So if your purpose is to try to understand this volume just by itself, there are chances you'll get struck by the depth of its meaning. So please first get into some other medium to advanced books in Hinduism and Buddhism before trying to absorb this volume, because the other previous three volumes are not enough to get across this one...but the essence is there, Gotama relied on the content of this volume for his Teachings, no doubt.<br />When you'll be done with the four volumes, you'll understand where the Buddhist Teachings come from...these Upanishads constitute the essence of the Hindu and Buddhist philosophies.<br />Unfortunately, they are probably the most cryptic texts that deal with the Ultimate, the style is so crude that one should not read them nor teach them to people that have not spent many years at studying the basics of the Indo-aryan philosophy (be it Hinduism, Buddhism,...) and are not prepared to approach the Absolute. Find a qualified teacher before reading them, unless you could be mislead and loose more time than if you had learned the basics before. So unless you know what you'll find in there, don't read them. If you feel prepared to it, get into it. If the Vedanta considered them as the secret teachings, it's not for the sake of hiding them, but rather because their use should be restricted to the most advanced scholars. There is no discrimination in this, only a will to prevent misunderstanding and misinterpreting of this difficult topic, nothing else. If you don't trust me, get into it and you'll understand very soon what i'm talking about. It's useless to begin learning a subject with the most advanced textbooks, except making you disgusted of it, so please don't try to catch the Ultimate directly with the Upanishads.nation in this, only a will to prevent misunderstanding and misinterpreting of this difficult topic, nothing else.

It deals with stochastic complexity and its implications on the information theoretical complexity of models. It shows that any modelling approach is a volontary act that has inherent limitations due to its scope. The beginning of the book is devoted to more or less philosophical aspects of modelling while the rest of the book is devoted to formal aspects of the choice of an information theoretical model. Even if the word stochastic is used extensively in the book, by no means is the content dealing with the issues of modelling data from measurements. This is really a pure information theory book which emphasis is on the coding part of models. This is why i give it four stars : the title mentions &quot;statistical inquiry&quot; while the book is devoted mainly to &quot;stochastic complexity&quot;. This title is hence somewhat misleading since it is closer to the book by Salomon Kullback than a practical book. On the other hand the content is really good at an information theory point of view...so it deserves its five stars without the drawback of the misleading title...	2001-09-29

These rituals and sacrifices are means for realizing it through superimposition, i.e. adding some false semantics over what is to be understood and then invalidating it by showing its inconsistency with what is to be understood. One should hence meditate on them to better dwelve into the difference between the relative and the absolute.<br />This volume is less abstract than the previous two volumes so people that prefer metaphors and more practical stories will be more at ease with this volume.	2001-09-28

Unless you already know which class of EV distribution to use in your case, this book will not serve much. An overly important aspect of fitting distributions concerns the family of distribution to use for fitting a particular data, and here i haven't found much insight about practical considerations in this book. This is an important gap in this book because it is due to be practical.<br />On the other hand, the estimation of particular EV distributions is thoroughly covered, with theoretical (many references) and practical issues (for the estimation only) well described in every section.<br />Another negative point concerns the distribution of XTREMES provided with the book which is far from complete, and with bugs (changing on-line the values of the parameters of some distributions makes it crash...). I consider this book as a theoretically extended version of the manual of XTREMES, but not a self-sontained statistical book.<br />In summary, if you are interested in a very specific EV family, then this book can be useful, but not as a textbook. Rather go to Castillo (EV in engineering) for a good textbook on EV distributions.	2001-09-20

While i consider the first volume not to be an easy read, this volume goes beyond any such treatment of the &quot;Absolute&quot; i've seen so far. Beware of the various contentions and objections between the dualists and non-dualists schools that are mentionned in the text, because it could easily mislead the reader about the point to be explained. If you feel unsufficiently prepared for that when reading the introduction of this volume on Hindu ethics (if you feel you mix the different views) then it would be better to stop and go to another more general book (Hindu, Buddhist, Vedanta...) to better feel the different approaches for the &quot;Absolute&quot;.<br />Anyway, this is the deepest treatment of the &quot;Absolute&quot; at a conceptual point of view. This is not without problems because dealing with the &quot;Absolute&quot; in a purely conceptual manner seems contradictory at first (concepts are dual by nature so they cannot help directly explain the infinite), but in fact the treatment is so exhaustive that it happens to be possible, at least if the reader can grasp the meaning of the text (a thorough understanding is required).	2001-09-20

Because it contains an important part of the Buddha Gotama's life, it is long, and in the same style as Gotama taught : parabola's, metaphors,...and with a very strong taste of aryan culture....hence it not easy for westerners to gather its meaning unambiguously. This is therefore not an introductory book. For that, &quot;The heart of the Buddha's teachings&quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh is probably the best choice to get the substance of the Teachings, since it relies on a wonderful intuitive style. If you prefer a more provocative as well as more sensible version of the Buddhist values, Sanditeva's &quot;Bodhicaryavatara&quot; is strongly recommended...it is shorter, more dense and extraordinary in its depth...up to you to choose the writing style that is the most likely to be fitting to you... Please don't forget to begin with introductory books about Buddhism since getting directly in the values without having a preliminary understanding of the culture will make you loose much of the more advanced books meaning...as always, first the basics to understand where you are going to, then go farther on the path you now clearly see...

The maths are not easy but quite &quot;understandable&quot; for science undergrads...some notions of calculus or topology would help... but the introduction is excellent and allows anyone to follow the course of the book (but for understanding the proofs a good math background is required).<br />Excellent for understanding the geometrical properties of fractals.	2001-08-13

The coupling of the Sanskrit and the Tibetan versions provides a definitive accuracy in the meaning of the text. The Sanskrit version alone is cryptic from time to time so that relying on the Tibetan version is very helpful, through its closeness to the western way of expressing things.<br />Although i feel this translation is the best English one, this version should not be used as a first version of the Bodhicaryavatara by newcomers. The translation from Crosby and Skilton is better suited for people not used to the context and the meaning of this text...thanks to its many excellent comments.	2001-07-23

The reason is that the authors have tried to provide a more poetic version of the text, to the detriment of the accuracy in meaning. Although such an intent is laudable, the result is mitigated. The problem comes from the language with its too different cultural roots, English appears difficult for allowing a poetic translation of a text of this nature. For exanple, the French translation from Louis Finot achieves accuracy and poetry at the same time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the translation is still very good, and the comments are sufficiently detailed for the reader to grasp all the substance from this wonderful text.	2001-07-21

The point is about showing how problem solving and evolution can be thought as mainly driven by the way components interact, not through some notion of an individual's &quot;intelligence&quot; that would be the property of the person (or any &quot;entity&quot;) which is solving a problem, and not the result of the contacts with his (its) environment.<br />If you like books providing a different point of view of AI this is the book you are looking for...in addition it is entertaining and easily readable.	2001-07-18

It guides you through practical methods for discovering the internal mechanisms of your mind. These mechanisms in fact are the illusions your mind tries to project to fool you about your perceptions. It explains very simply the difference between the actual perception and what your &quot;everyday's life&quot; perception provides you.<br />Of course meditation is the central tool of the book but the objective is about finding the difference between what you think you're feeling and what you actually feel. The theme of the book is about making you discover the &quot;true reality&quot;, nothing less. It might seem pedantic to state something like this but if you really understand this book you must see the world differently. If not, it means that the author has failed.	2001-07-03

This allows to better understand the various assumptions hidden behind this difficult concept. Together with the reading of the Bodhicaryavatara, it gives a very deep understanding of the implications of being &quot;enlightened&quot;. It clearly shows that enlightenment is something very difficult to find (i should have better said &quot;to be&quot;) while at the same time it is mainly a question of being convinced that one is truly enlightened.<br />I would suggest readers no to read this book before having read and understood the Bodhicaryavatara unless it will be almost of no use for the reader. One first need to know what we are talking about before getting into a conceptual discussion of its various aspects...my opinion is that one cannot understand this book before really mastering the ideas of the Bodhicaryavatara. When you're convinced you understand it very deeply, not just intellectually, but also through experience, than only you're ready for this book.<br />So this is a difficult book unless you already know quite well what it is going to be about...	2001-06-28

On the other hand, placing comments before each chapter makes the book more analytical, and this impacts on the depth and beauty of the verses of the Bodhicaryavatara itself. It is probably a good idea to read it once for understanding the why's and who's and then go back through it without reading the comments at all.<br />Since it has been written after or partly at the same time as the Siksa Samuccaya, interested readers should also get the Siksa Samuccaya and read both books. It is also probably easier to first read this book and only after having been taught the context of the &quot;story&quot; go to the Siksa Samuccaya which is difficult to understand without a consequent knowledge of the Buddhist culture.<br />Anyway, this is a high quality translation as well as a very good commented version of the Bodhicaryavatara.

It provides a manual with the main ideas (with comments) gathered (in the Mahayana and others works) by Shanditeva for writing his wonderful Bodhicaryavatara. It is much less dense that it's Bodhicaryavatara follower that gives the essence of the Mahayana with compassion as its centerpoint, which can be difficult to read due to its conceptual style. Newcomers to Buddhism should not begin with this book, but rather go to more gentle introductory texts (see &quot;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&quot; for example), one should first learn the context before entering the core of the ideas.<br />Even if editing is lacking compared to current standards, the fact that this book is available more than compensates for that. If you intend to read the Bodhicaryavatara, then you cannot allow not to read this one, even if you read it after having read the Bodhicaryavatara at first. Those books are to be read many times for being properly understood anyway, so the point is about getting them...<br />Be conscious that Buddhism is about philosophy, not religion as stated by another reviewer. It does not care about the way you are practising the good, the intent is the main focus. So do not hope finding an easy way to salvation with Buddhism, it is a volontarist approach, by practice and work on self. Faith is not the main aspect of it, acting is !	2001-06-15

All concepts are explained intuitively as well as formally, having in mind the objective of making things clear. Few books exhibit such a good approach and other reviewers are right when they emphasize the highly pedagogical quality of Luenberger's books ! This is no overstatement.<br />The advantage of using this algebraic formulation lies in the simplicity as well as the understandability of the state-space approach, which is best explained in those terms. Most books assume that everyone knows what a state space is without explicitly showing what it is really about. This book just uses the reverse assumption, in that you're not asssumed to know everything before getting into it.<br />Only some basic knowledge in algebra (undergraduate-level) is required but even without experience in algebraic formalism, it is possible to go through the content thanks to the important number of examples and the intuitive explanations.<br />A must-read !	2001-05-02

Chung at our math department as an introduction to probability theory, i think that Feller is just another view of the problem. If you prefer a concise writing style then Chung is better. On the other hand, Feller's books are full of examples so that you cannot go through this book without having an accurate picture of the historical developments of probability theory and its many applications (even if sometimes applications are driving the need for theory...). This is anyway something you must have read if you want to get an intuitive understanding of probability theory.<br />Whatever your preferred writing style is, Feller is probably a &quot;must-read&quot; if you're involved on probability theory, just because of its importance in the literature, not because you like it. Maths are not just about formalism, they're also a matter of culture.	2001-04-30

It's full of examples covering the whole stuff in DSP. However this is certainly not fur use as an introductory book because the aim is not the explanation of fundamental concepts in DSP (for that go to Lyons &quot;Understanding Digital Signal Processing&quot;). Maybe it is possible to learn DSP with this book but then as a companion of a good undergrad course, not for self-study.<br />As stated by another reviewer, this book is over-crowded with developments, details and examples that could be overwhelming to the newcomer. This is probably its biggest drawback, in that its completeness hinders on its readability. So be aware that this is not an easy DSP book, it's THE DSP book.	2001-04-21

Emphasis is on introducing the concepts for allowing interested people to get into advanced theoretical developments (and practical too). However there are some scientific prerequisites (physics, dynamical systems...).<br />Writing is very good, intuitive, does not assume any particular  mathematical background or practice with tools for simulating chaotic systems. Exposition is rather short because of a scientific writing style, it's not about scientific popularization (don't feel this is pedantic, writing is concise and not meant to be crowded with examples). In its approach, i think it's the smoothest scientific introductory book on the subject. For example Schroeder's (Fractals chaos and power laws) is overly mathematical as an introduction. Williams' (chaos theory tamed) on the other hand has a similar approach to this one but it is longer, more general and with less emphasis on the applied side of chaos theory (the analytic side). From an economical point of view, William's is cheaper while covers more about chaos theory, but this volume is scientifically better and more useful than Williams', which is too &quot;generalistic&quot;.<br />In summary : a very good self-contained and short introduction to chaos theory. But for a first book on chaos theory go to Williams, it's easier to read.	2001-04-20

It does not insist on the technicalities proper to the examples but rather tries to gather what one can learn from specific situations concerning the necessary components for complexity to arise.<br />Focus is on intuition and global understanding, not on mathematical aspects. However, some knowledge in math would certainly help...a first course in probability theory and some background in dynamical systems is a good idea (at the level of undergraduate courses in pure and applied sciences).<br />All explanations are not rigorous but the objective is to provide a good intuition about the mechanisms driving complexity.

I fully aggree with the reviewer from 1997. I don't think this book being sloppy nor difficult for beginners (sorry other reviewers). It certainly requires some time to be read (i recall having read it at a pace of about two or three evenings for one chapter, with about 2-3 hours per evening so i don't think it is that difficult for beginners). In addition, Tanenbaum's style is always good and his sense of humor makes the text full of those subtle remarks that make you dive into the subject with less pain.<br />Probably that the third part of the book about Distributed OS is not a good reading for beginners but just skip it on your first reading and go back to it when you'll be ready.<br />An important thing is that Part II which is about case studies should not be skipped by newcomers ! This is exactly while reading this part of the book that you'll understand all the concepts you learned in the first part, by applying all this theoretical stuff on actual OS implementations.

It provides a very gentle introduction to networking but it is certainly not enough to fully understand the TCP/IP stack for instance, or important routing issues.<br />The networking litterature is very large, but here are some good ones :<br />- TCP/IP stack: &quot;TCP-IP illustrated&quot; from Stevens, &quot;Internetworking with TCP/IP&quot; from Comer.<br />- Routing: &quot;Interconnections: bridges and routers&quot; from Perlman, &quot;Routing in the Internet&quot; from Huitema and &quot;Internet Routing Architectures&quot; from Halabi.<br />Another good general networking book even if somewhat more advanced (than a pure introduction i mean) is &quot;Computer networks: a system approach&quot; from Davie, Peterson and Clark.	2001-02-12

The question is not about convincing you that this arrow exists, but it tries to provide evidence gathered from thermodynamics that it could be the case indeed !<br />You'll probably enjoy this book in any case because it presents the question of &quot;time&quot; in a very broad (multi-disciplinary) manner.

Unfortunately, if you're interested in analyzing and modeling some practical dynamic system, this is probably of no use. It mainly describes systems for which there are already known closed-form equations describing the dynamics, and shows where and why chaos comes from. It may help you if you're dealing with a mechanical system that can be easily modelled by a set of ODE's but it is not analytic enough to be useful for poeple involved into modeling and analysis of a completely new dynamic system for which no equations already exist.<br />I think that books on &quot;chaos theory&quot; are far better like : &quot;Chaos theory tamed&quot;, &quot;Fractals, chaos and power laws&quot;...<br />For people interested in time series analysis whith chaotic looking data, please don't skip the exceptionnal : &quot;Nonlinear Time Series Analysis&quot; from Kantz and Schreiber !

It's the first Perl book that has provided such a negative impression. I bought it in order to improve my knowledge of Perl but in fact it's just a messy try to perform things you should never do with Perl ! What i've found in this book is for example &quot;How to use Perl for doing a job C or C++ already does more efficiently and in a neat manner&quot;. It compares the dirty features of Perl (object-oriented, supposedly &quot;advanced data structures&quot;, variables scope...) with those of other languages...If you need to do OO programming, use an OO programming language like C++ or Java, not Perl ! You'll certainly not learn OO programming with Perl. If you want to use advanced data structures efficiently, use C. But using Perl for doing such things is crazy : Perl is an interpreted language, meant to allow easy code writing, allowing the programmer not to deal with data structures intricacies ! This book shows you how to simulate all the interesting features of C, C++ and Java with a language not meant to do that ! It should be renamed &quot;Emulating efficient programming languages with Perl !&quot;<br />Maybe the last part of the book dealing with the Perl internals deserves some attention but it is on the web anyway, like everything else for Perl ([...] [...] ...).<br />I would suggest &quot;Learning Perl&quot; as an introductory book and then go to &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;, &quot;Mastering algorithms with Perl&quot; for more advanced topics...but unless you absolutely need it in paper version, don't buy an advanced book on Perl. Always first consider the web : if you need an algorithm or a means to do something unusual with Perl, just search on the previously mentionned web sites...you'll certainly find it (even not always on the first try).	2001-01-22
US	48803027	R9XT34QAYVQBK	1565922840	658971757	Learning Perl, Second Edition (Nutshell Handbooks)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Easiest introduction to Perl	If you're already familiar with programming, this book is the fastest way to learn the essentials of Perl. It does not covers all features but if you need more specific things in Perl it probably means you should use another programming language. Perl is very efficient for string processing and matching regular expressions but certainly not for low-level programing with tight operational requirements. However, for writing scripts very fast to analyze files or performing simple operations, Perl is best !<br />If you want more advanced Perl features go to the &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot; that contains dozens of tricks for almost every possible problem or &quot;Mastering algorithms with Perl&quot;...but first look at the many Perl sites before considering buying such a book because almost everything in on the web !<br />If you want to learn Perl whithin a couple of hours, buy this book !	2001-01-22

It's nothing more than a reference book. Don't learn Perl with this book, nor try to find too advanced features. Learn Perl with &quot;Learning Perl&quot; which is really a must-read for any beginner, even if it requires some light programming background... Most Perl documentation is on the web and books like the &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot; are on-line. Save your money if you have an easy access to the web ... .<br />If you really like Perl (like me) then you should consider &quot;Mastering Algorithms with Perl&quot; which is full of useful tricks for improving the efficiency of your Perl code.	2001-01-22

A &quot;cookbook&quot;...but for algorithms in Perl	This book is certainly not meant for learning Perl nor being read from the first page to the last...it's a compilation of some of the advanced features of Perl aimed at resolving very specific algorithmic problems.<br />Two examples :<br />1) i had an efficiency problem with my code that required boosting some subroutines that were heavily used but could not be easily implemented with a data structure...so i discovered the &quot;Memoize&quot; module that performs caching on subroutines, allowing me to speed up my code by a factor of 10 !<br />2) i had to find the maximum likelihood estimation of several probability distributions on some important amount of data, and for multi-parameter distributions. I just used the complex module and LU decomposition to find the roots of my non-linear systems, which can be &quot;easily&quot; done by specifying the equations to be resolved (expressed as subroutines which values are instanciated by the resolver) and applying a heuristic root finding algorithm based on Newton's method combined with LU decomposition. It would have taken several days or even weeks to write it from scratch in C or C++, but most of the code already existed so it was written within one day !<br />Of course, it's not a general-purpose book on Perl programming but rather a cookbook for some very specific utilization of Perl like &quot;non-linear equations systems root finding&quot; or graphs theory problems...so don't expect this to be a well-organized book since it's not intended to be that way !	2001-01-22

Even if some of the papers whithin the book are certainly important contributions to their field, my impression is that it does not justify paying that price for extended versions of the papers. The book by itself is merely a compilation of the papers but NOTHING MORE ! If you are interested, just get the papers on the web and read them, but don't buy this book !<br />I hoped i would find some unifying ideas in the book, or even remarks in the extended versions of the papers but nothing... I really wonder how it got published. The only useful information is the extended references for every paper (hence i gave 1 star) ...but it's not worth the price of the book !<br />I have been extremely disappointed because i'm used to very good work from M. Taqqu, including numerous outstanding papers, but this book is the worst i've ever bought. It does not deserves the name &quot;book&quot;.	2001-01-20

The style is extremely formal and unless you already read some of the referring papers, you'll be lost within some couple of pages. It is however a very good book providing a different view of what is called performance guarantees using a deterministic formalism (opposed to statistical). Part two of the book called &quot;stochastic guarantees&quot; is somewhat difficult to read because it requires some important background in stochastic processes you're not due to know as a computer scientist. This second part requires learning advanced stochastic modeling concepts (Wolff for example)...<br />The reason for not giving 5 stars is ... the lack of explanations that force the reader to search somewhere else in order to understand what the author is talking about !<br />In summary, this is a good book .... But if you're involved in packet networks performance analysis, it's worth the effort....	2001-01-20

Style is informal and nontechnical. You're not required to have a particular background in mathematics to understand the content. Reading it is particularly easy, and it provides excellent pointers to more advanced topics on chaos theory.<br />If you already have some background in dynamic systems and modeling, i would recommend Morrison's book : &quot;The Art of Modeling Dynamic Systems : Forecasting for Chaos, Randomness, and Determinism&quot; which is somewhat more technical but certainly more helpful for getting a good idea of what chaos theory is, at an engineering point of view.<br />In addition, for getting a very broad view of chaos in the real world, Schroeder's &quot;Fractals, Chaos, Power laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise&quot; is incomparable ! It overwhelms you with the footprints of chaos in every possible context. A must-read ! But very technical and requires some important knowledge in physics and science engineering...<br />However, as an easy nontechnical introduction on chaos theory, this book really deserves its 5 stars !	2001-01-20

It goes at a pace that allows you to follow the course of the chapters without forcing you to dive into many other books. However, it covers all the basics from DSP and even more advanced topics.<br />This is a must-read as an introduction on DSP. Books like Franklins et al.'s &quot;Digital Control of Dynamic Systems&quot; or Oppenheim's &quot;Discrete Time Signal Processing&quot; are not meant to be introductory textbooks...but once you'll be done with this one then you can go to the more advanced ones.<br />For another introductory book, the one from Proakis and Manolakis also deserves a mention, but Lyons's is my first choice for introduction. Lyons's style and presentation are better... I would recommend using Lyons for a first iuntroduction and then to Proakis and Manolakis for further mastering the subject, but staying at an introductory level...	2001-01-20

This book is certainly the best book you'll find around for treating in depth the subject of modeling dynamic systems. The style is clear and very intuitive. It provides a well-structured identification of dynamic systems and explains the &quot;what you can do and what you cannot&quot; for modeling all types of dynamic systems. It's true that it can be hard to find but waiting some couple of weeks certainly is no reason for not trying to get this extraordinary overview of dynamic systems !<br />The only drawback you could find is that it is too short... reading it makes you want more...so using it as an introduction to dynamic systems can only motivate you at going further in the field of dynamic systems modeling !	2001-01-20

The problem is that it is almost exclusively theoretical. It should not be used for learning spectral analysis but rather as a reference book. There are very few practical examples but when looking for a proof or an abstract presentation of a particular concept, this book should allow you to understand the theory that lies behind... However, a very good treatment of spectral analysis and very broad coverage of the subject...	2001-01-19
