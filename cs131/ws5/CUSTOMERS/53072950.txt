Headaches, crankiness, bad stomache, neck aches - the works. I know that it's estimated that 85% of all disease is rooted in the mind, and that stress can definitely kill you.<br /><br />The Sedona Method taught me that I actually could choose the way I felt, that my emotions were not a part of me. In the simple process of letting go I found a very profound and joyful peace.<br /><br />My headaches, stress, and other related problems are gone. My relationships have improved now that I am happier. My business is even picking up now that I can think more clearly and make better decisions.<br /><br />I can and do recommend the Sedoma Method to everybody that will listen. I have given away 6 copies of the book as gifts. I honestly believe that if we gave everybody in the world this book we'd all be so happy that world peace would be achieved.<br /><br />Give the book a read and do the exercises. Prove for yourself if this works.	2005-04-23

However, I am also not a professional photographer or photoshopper - and I have gotten so much from this book.<br />Within 5 minutes of picking up this book I had taken a color digital photograph and made it look like it was shot on black and white infrared film.<br />It took me a similar amount of time to make color images look like I had used an alternative process to develop the film.<br />The steps for just about anything you'd want to do creatively are short, easy to follow, and are accompanied by excellent demonstration photos. The book is in full color, which is extremely important given the subject matter.<br />I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to take digital photographs and do artistic and wonderful things with them.	2003-11-13

Important and entertaining,	This book on it's very surface is an entertaining thriller, well thought out, and with complex characters. On top of all that there is a serious bit of history lurking about. The kind of history that you don't get to read about much, and the Catholic church wishes nobody knew about.<br />Presented as a mystery - the book may seem uncontroversial but it speaks of history, people and organizations that actually existed. It is also richly filled with symbolism.<br />Hidden amongst it's pages are tons of fun little secrets as well. There is a coded message on the front and back flap of the dustjackets. I won't reveal it - but here's a hint: look for letters that are slightly bolder. There are hidden anagrams (notably a character whose last name is an anagram of Baigent and who's first name is Leigh - referrings to the authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail). The fictitions publishing company of the main character is called Doubleknight - a reference to an old Knights templar crest. Fun stuff to discover.<br />I had loads of fun reading this book and couldn't put it down. Important lessons are imparted through the allegory of teh story that require some deeper inderstandings of the &quot;great mystery&quot; to work out - but please get this book and read it.	2003-09-01

Now it is comforting to think that there is objective truth but let's look a little deeper.<br />Let's take the question, \\"Is artificial sweetner good for you\\".<br />First, what is the objective measure of \\"good\\". Sure we all understand that artificial sweetner may not be \\"good\\" for our health, but maybe it's benefits outweigh an alternative. Maybe I dring 6 sugared sodas a day and get diabetes - surely that isn't good for me. So does the question mean \\"in comparison to the alternative\\" or does it mean, \\"good for me in general\\"<br />You see the measure of \\"good\\" could be made in more than one way precluding an absolute objective truth.<br />Is murder bad? Most people would say yes without equivocation. But, what if you could go back in time and murder Hitler in 1921 - would that be bad? Hmmmmmm - it get's more complicated.<br />Let's move beyond value judgments into scientifically measurable phenomena in very discrete units. Are electrons particles or waves? They can be either depending on how you look at them.<br />Therefore the very building blocks of our universe are 100% dependent upon subjective reality.<br />The universe runs on subjectivity and probability. So if I aska question like, \\"do bears poop in the woods?\\" The real answer is, \\"probably, and it is more likely that they do if you actually go see them poop in the woods.\\"	2003-08-01

It's advice is excellent and presented with humor and in a very accessible manor.<br />I disagree with the other reviewer who said that this is all stuff &quot;we've heard before&quot;. It may seem like common sense stuff, but the problem with common sense is that it isn't too common.<br />In my classes I encounter highly intelligent, educated, professional women who still jog alone at dusk wearing a walkman. I have spoken to countless women who own mace and keep it in their bedroom drawer where they will never get to it in time.<br />These women are not dumb, and this level of unpreparedness is not unique to females either. It's just that we are not used to thinking about, &quot;what would i do if...&quot; scenarios.

The book is this mans journal - of course it is very personal. It is supposed to give us insight into his own inner conflicts. Personally I do not trust people for whom everything is so simple that they have no inner conflicts. That is fundamentalism and a distorted and shallow way to view the complexity of experience.<br />Second to the right wing nut who went off calling this guy a fruitloop for his work with the Marines etc. I have no idea what you are all about - or if you even read this book.<br />I will say that this book confirms for me the difference between a soldier and a warrior. A warrior is a pioneer of thought and last to pick up the sword. A soldier is essentially an automoton trained to take orders without question or thought. Both are necessary cogs in the US Military, despite their contradictory nature.<br />Green Berets in particular have missions that go beyond mindlessly fulfilling orders. As with many special operators they are required to think creatively, communicate with lead and inspire natives, and overcome obstacles. It's not just about what you see in Rambo movies.<br />This book is important for soldiers, and martial artists of all types. It gives us the sense that peace and conflict are like yin and yang- and cannot ever be totally separated. For hundreds of years the samurai (Japan's professional warriors) were expected to participate in writing poetry and flower arranging.	2003-05-08

This book is interesting because it covers topics from fitness, to self-defense, to rope and wall climbing.<br />The self-defense recommendations are sometimes bizarre and dangerous however.

This particular move is biomechanically and tactically dangerous in real self-defense - and there are others like it.<br />I don't care what a person's credentials are - there is a lot of stuff taught to armed forces all over the world.<br />The book has some interest, it just isn't good for what it's intended.	2002-09-13

The author worked with a tremendous amount of source material to compose this biography of one of history's most important and fascinating characters. Where \\"facts\\" were in conflict, the author presneted multiple viewpoints. Suppositions were presented as such and not as facts.<br />Dick Burton is undoubtedly a larger than life historical figure, however, the author portrays him as human - both his faults and his strengths are exponded upon.<br />Much of the material is directly quoted from source material, which makes Burton and related individuals voices come alive.<br />My only criticism of the book is minor. There are some tangents that seem to me to be given too much space in the book. The author sometimes writes mini biographies of somewhat incidental characters. This is simply my opinion, and others may, and probably will disagree.<br />While this book is a biography, there is historical and thological gold there. Much can be learned about the 19th century Middle east, Africa and the politics of the time. Also, there is a lot of material about Islam and other religions that Burton studied.	2002-08-30

I particularly liked the mapping of the accupuncture points to specific nerves. This may be useful from a research perspective.<br />The rest of the book leaves a lot to be desired. It is a &quot;self-defense technique&quot; oriented book that does explain some nerve attacks. However, the photos are tiny and not particularly well done. It would be difficult to get much of use from them. The explanations are also fairly vague.<br />It is difficult to learn much from such technique style books. This book would have been more useful if it had been done in the style of &quot;Practical Chin Na&quot; which is more principle oriented. I would like to have seen each of the points close up with a useful way of striking it and then maybe an application.	2002-01-07
