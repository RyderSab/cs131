She was conceived as the perfect donor for her older sister, Kate, who was diagnosed with leukemia at age 3. Neither of Kate's parents or her older brother were close enough matches to be a marrow donor. Anna was the perfect donor, and her umbilical cord blood saved her sister's life for the first time. Kate went into remission for 5 years, and the family was peaceful and happy. Then Kate relapsed and needed more treatments. Anna was the donor each time that Kate needed help; but now at age 13, Anna has rebelled for the right to have a choice in whether her body parts are removed to save Kate. Kate now needs a kidney transplant, which is far more dangerous to Anna that any of the earlier medical procedures she has had to endure.<br /><br />Sara and Brian are the loving parents of Kate and Anna, and their older brother, Jesse, who, to say the least, is a troubled kid. The book is told from the perspective of each of these characters, as well as the lawyer that Anna retained to represent her in the medical emancipation case and the court-appointed guardian ad litum. Each chapter is told from a different perspective, which allows the author to thoroughly explore the impact of Kate's illness on each of the characters.<br /><br />The author has tremendous insight into both the physical and emotional trauma suffered by each member of the family. Their family life has largely been centered around Kate's needs, which has obviously had repercussions on the other two children. As a parent, I had great empathy with the challenges faced by the parents. Brian said \\"parenting is really just a matter of tracking, of hoping your kids do not get so far ahead you can no longer see their next moves.\\" In a later chapter he said \\"They outgrow us so much faster than we outgrown them.\\"<br /><br />The book covers the full gamut of emotions - there are some really funny scenes, some very sad ones, some more hopeful, some uplifting. The moral, legal and ethical issues are very thought provoking. The thought of parenting such a sick child is frightening, but the fundamental message is that we each have the capacity to adapt and change and play the hand we are dealt with.opeful, some uplifting.

She wants to portray herself as a stoic, dignified, quietly suffering widow, but can't quite pull that off. She eats ice cream and Oreos obsessively, gains weight, gives away her nearly-new living room furniture to Goodwill instead of parting with her husbands belongings, breaks all her dishes and shows up to work in her bathrobe and slippers because she can't find anything that fits.<br /><br />She decides to re-invent herself, because her old self seems to be lost. She moves to Ashland to be near an old college friend and starts to rebuild her life. But she's not over the grieving process yet, and has setbacks and bad days. She takes a job as a waitress because that's all there is in Ashland, starts dating an actor, and befriends a troubled 13-year old girl through the Big Sister program.<br /><br />Sophie's despair and growth through the grieving process are heartwarming and a little frightening, because I couldn't help wondering how I would fare in a similar situation. The chapter names in the book describe her journey to renewed mental health: Denial, Oreos, Anger, Depression, Escrow, Ashes, Lust, Bargaining, Waitressing, Mentoring, Dating, Baking, Acceptance, Goodwill, Thanksgiving. She seems to take in others who are flawed or needy in some way, and in helping them to mend themselves, gets her life back on an even keel.<br /><br />The novel veered from sad, heartbreaking situations, to hilariously funny incidents, to joyous occasions, and from the outset I was cheering for Sophie to navigate the obstacles in her life's journey and return to happiness.	2005-01-30

The story begins in 1863 with the baptism of John Francis Fitzgerald in Boston and concludes almost 100 years later with the inauguration of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The families' roots are traced back to the great immigration following the Irish potato famine in the 1840's. From immigration to becoming the American royal family in just three generations is a remarkable achievement that is chronicled in fascinating detail in this comprehensive, definitive narrative.<br /><br />Even though it is more than 800 pages, the book is not a dry history text, but rather an intriguing glimpse into the lives of the charmed and sometimes tragic lives of this huge Irish Catholic clan. Nothing is omitted, from the affairs of Joseph Kennedy, to the flirtations of Kathleen, the appalling lobotomy of Rosemary, and the sexual antics of John F. Kennedy. The political shenanigans of the elder Fitzgerald provide an interesting examination of Boston politics in the early 1900's...rife with graft and insider manipulation.<br /><br />The author's writing style is rich, powerful and mesmerizing. For instance, to describe the ascent of JFK into the limelight of American politics, she writes: \\"For his capacity to arouse the questing imagination of his fellow citizens, and of much of the world beyond America's borders, was to elevate the family saga past the borders of mythology. By the beginning of the fifties he already contained all the elements which his leadership was to be compounded, forged in tumultuous experience, anchored and given direction by his often resented but always unbreakable links to his extraordinary family.\\"<br /><br />The level of detail and insightful analysis into the complex characters and relationships in the family is well worth your investment of time in reading this tome. A book you won't soon forget.	2005-01-30

She is smart, witty, totally devoted to her work, and somewhat of a klutz, physically and emotionally. The book begins with the start of a new day in which she wakes up late, fears that she has killed another in a long-line of tropical fish, inadvertently wears two mismatched shoes to work, and climbs out a window in the Capitol building with an elderly gentleman who was supposed to appear in front of a committee hearing on prescription drug issues (but arrives too strung out on marijuana to make a good impression). She then proceeds to stumble over a camera cable at the hearing and tumble into a row of seated journalists, causing at least one of them physical harm. This is just a typical day in the life of Sammy.<br /><br />Sammy's escapades both on the Hill and off are fueled by her maniacal focus on the health care issues she cares so deeply about, as well as her insecurities and quirky personality. She seems to constantly wear the wrong thing, or get something spilled on her, or bump into things. She, like almost everyone else on the Hill, has an obsession with staying totally connected with e-mail, cell phones and PDA's. Everyone seems to have a BlackBerry and to use it constantly. Sammy accidentally hits the Reply-All button on her BlackBerry and sends a humorous and sexually suggestive reply that had been intended only for her boyfriend to hundreds of politicians and colleagues. Another BlackBerry incident at the end of the novel will have you roaring with laughter.<br /><br />The glimpse of Washington politics is fascinating, and takes us through the legislative process, including rewriting a health care bill, breaking a filibuster in the Senate, power-plays between senators and their staffs, and ultimately the presidential campaign trail.<br /><br />I charged through the book in just over a day, thoroughly enjoying every minute of it. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen to Sammy next. Would she fall in love with Aaron? Would her senator pass the bill she had worked on so diligently? Would yet another of her pet fish die mysteriously? Would Senator Gary be selected as the VP candidate? You'll fall in love with this charming, heart-warming character and root for her to succeed every step of the way. Maybe we'll meet her in a sequel.

Men are viewed more as essential accessories than life partners, which probably explains why their relationships and marriages are so short-lived and unfulfilling.<br /><br />Their days are filled with visits to hairdressers, dermatologists, therapists, , tanning salons, gossip-sessions, endless shopping sprees and society luncheons or benefits at which they sometimes purport to do good works.<br /><br />They call themselves the Bergdorf Blondes, and getting the hair color just right is apparently not easy (or cheap). The main character (who is never named in the book) is the only one who seems to actually have a job, but it's not exactly a demanding career; she writes an occasional article for a fashion magazine.<br /><br />The book is peppered with mentions of designer labels, including Manolo Blahnik, Chloe, Harry Winston, Gucci, Cavin Klein, Chanel, Pucci, Louis Vuitton. They drink Pellegrino and Bellini's and hope for an invitation to fly on someone's PJ (private jet) to Aspen or Cannes or The Riviera.<br /><br />The book is satirical and exaggerated, and is a quick, amusing read. I only hope that the idle rich are not as shallow, jaded, and materialistic as they are portrayed in this novel.	2005-01-30

She can't completely forget him, however, and follows him from Silicon Valley to the small Northern California town of Cottonmouth where she takes on a new life.<br /><br />Bobbie Jones is now 10 pounds thinner, sporting a sassy red hairdo, and an adventurous new attitude. Just what a 40-year old former Silicon Valley accountant needs, or is it? She soon finds herself the subject of gossip in the small town when she moves next door to the sexy, rumored serial killer Nick Angel. She finds him frightening and irresistible at the same time. But she's also attracted to the town sheriff. The suspense and intrigue of the novel operates on two levels: which man will find his way to her heart (and her bed) first; and who killed the her ex-husband's lover's husband (yes there are a lot of characters in this book!)<br /><br />The characters are all colorful, and for the most part, believable, but I sometimes thought the book was set in small town East Texas, not the more urbane, sophisticated California. Bobbie takes a waitress job at the local caf&eacute;, where she is befriended by the owner Mavis, and comes into contact with all the town locals, including the likes of Jimbo, Cookie and Brax. She finds herself in amusing, sometimes precarious situations.<br /><br />The steamy sex scenes do not dominate the plot, but definitely add some sizzle. Did Bobbie end up with Nick or the Sheriff? I'm not telling. Read the book and find out how Bobbie comes out on top (no pun intended), and whether there's life after divorce for a 40'ish former accountant in Cottonmouth, California. Sex and the Serial Killer is a fun, fast-paced page-turner, and I'm looking forward to more from this author.	2005-01-16

She has seen many criminals escape the system to prey on other helpless children. Her husband, Caleb Frost, is a methodical, meticulous stonemason.<br />But in spite of their respective skills, they are unable to protect their 5-year child, Nathaniel. He suddenly stops talking, and the psychologist to whom they take him for an evaluation discovers that he has been molested. However, he isn&#146;t talking and they have no clues as to the identity of his molester. Patrick Ducharme is Nina&#146;s oldest and best friend and has also befriended Nathaniel. Nathaniel whispers &#147;Father&#148; to Patrick when he questioned him about the molestation, and they leap to the conclusion that Caleb was the guilty party. Fortunately, they soon discovered that he really meant Father Glen from the nearby parish.<br />Nina, horrified about the crime and obsessed with protecting Nathaniel from further harm, decides to take the law into her own hands and sets off a chain of events that she has no control over. The book explores the depth of love and commitment that a mother feels for her child and raises the question of what actions can be justified in the interest of protecting that child.<br />I was engaged by the plot twists and the legal arguments for and against Nina&#146;s actions, but in the end I decided that the conclusion was just too unrealistic. If our society is to function ethically and equitably, no one, not even a mother who loved her child so deeply and totally, can be allowed to be the judge, jury and executioner.	2002-11-10

She has long been an advocate and has supported many causes for the plight of abused women. But her writing has slowed down considerably since she has become the primary care giver for her older brother who is suffering from acute rheumatoid arthritis. Grace is increasingly bitter and depressed and feeling trapped in their home in Vermont and is somewhat of a martyr because she won't accept much help from others.<br /><br />She starts an e-mail correspondence with a woman who claims to be suffering emotional and physical abuse from a controlling husband and gives the woman advice on defending herself and escaping from the abusive relationship. Grace becomes obsessed with the plight of the woman, and when the correspondence abruptly stops, she fears the worst. She gradually realizes that something about the woman's story didn't ring true, but she is unable to make contact with her.<br /><br />In the meantime, Grace's long-time romance with the inimitable Vinnie is heating up. Vinnie splits his time between remodeling his old barn in Vermont and his New York City apartment. Grace is madly in love with him but won't allow herself to become dependent on him. Grace has a 22-year old daughter Nicky who is quirky, smart and totally loveable.<br /><br />Grace refuses to accept her brother's advice about ending the e-mail relationship, and the violent events that follow are rather contrived and unbelievable.

He decides to hit the road one more time in his aging pickup truck with his dog named Highway and visit the scene in Iowa where he met the love of his life.<br />This nostalgic journey, written in Waller's distinctive spare and concise style covers a lot of ground figuratively and literally as Kincaid reminisces about some of the great experiences he has had, stops on his trip to visit old friends from previous trips and makes some startling discoveries about his past.<br />Since I'm usually a proponent of happy endings, this epilogue wasn't completely satisfying in that the conclusion was bittersweet. Without giving away the ending, I will state only that Kincaid discovers something about his past that he finds deeply satisfying, but ultimately the true happiness that he had sought for so long evades him.<br />I was totally engaged by this sad, poignant tale of the twilight of a lonesome adventurer's life and kept thinking of the Socrates' quote \\"the unexamined life is not worth living\\". Kincaid's life has been thoroughly examined and was well worth living.	2002-10-13

He targets young, innocent nubile blonds, usually new to the area with few connections to the local community, so that when he kills them, there will be no clues pointing to him. He is more interested in the pursuit than in sex with his victims, and as soon as the seduction is complete, he becomes bored with the women and quickly strangles them with a rope and steals their cash and jewelry. He buries the bodies on a remote hillside. He also uses computer software to scan in faces of victims and potential victims and attaches them to photos of bodies in alluring and pornographic postures that he has downloaded from the internet. Most of the recipients of the photos are too ashamed and embarrassed to turn in the photos to the police.<br />Lucas Davenport, veteran detective from many other Sandford novels, is assigned to the case when a strangled corpse is unearthed from a shallow grave where she had been dumped about 18 months earlier. When they discover that the hillside is a veritable graveyard of other strangled females corpses, the investigation escalates and federal agencies are brought in to assist. Davenport and his partner know that this will only slow down progress, so they are determined to act promptly on every clue and solve the crimes quickly.<br /><br />Through some brilliant deduction and computer work, they narrowed the field of acquaintances and suspects considerably and even questioned Qatar's mother, who runs a small local museum.

I'm happy to report that I was wrong. Grisham has mastered this genre as skillfully as the legal field.<br />In the summer of 1952, Luke Chandler learns about keeping secrets and telling lies. At the tender age of 7, he's the central character in this novel set in the rural Arkansas town of Black Oak in the heart of cotton farming land. The crops are ready for picking, and the Chandlers, like all the local farmers, hire on gangs of Mexicans and hill people to pick the crops during the long harvest season.<br />Luke lives with his mother and father and grandma and grandpa on the Chandler farm. They're barely eking out a living, since the cost of seed, fertilizer and equipment is barely covered by the crops, which can be so easily affected by drought or floods. Farmers are born worriers, and though they try not to talk too much about their worries in front of Luke, he is very perceptive and mature for a 7-year old. His father's younger brother is away fighting in Korea, which gives them something else to worry about.<br />Right away, Luke senses trouble among the Spruills, who are the hill people that are now camping in their front yard. They have a beautiful, sultry 17-year old daughter, as well as a surly, violent older son, and a mentally retarded son. The Chandler's main concern is that every member of the family pick as much cotton as possible every day. The Mexicans are staying in the barn, and at least one of them is sinister and violent and carries a knife. The tension between the Mexicans and Spruills simmers just below the boiling point, and threatens to boil over at any moment.<br />Luke witnesses and overhears events that are very troubling to him, and although as a good Baptist he knows the evil of lying and keeping secrets, he is also aware of the damage that could be done if he reveals everything he knows. The town is all riled up after a brutal fight ended in a death. A fatherless baby is born to the teenage daughter of the nearby sharecroppers. The Spruills' daughter is flirting with the violent Mexican picker, and Luke witnesses a brutal murder. The farmers are obsessed with the prospect of early floods that would destroy the cotton before it can be picked. Following each and every game of the St. Louis Cardinals provides one of the few entertainments available to the farmers. Meanwhile, someone is secretively painting the weathered siding of the Chandlers' farmhouse one plank at a time.<br />Life on a cotton farm seems simple and placid, but the intrigue and emotions portrayed in this novel contradict that misconception. The characters are vivid and real. The details of everyday life in the farming community are extraordinary. What seems to be a simple novel about farming in the 1950's becomes a fascinating, absorbing tale of the daily struggle to survive. The pristine white paint that creeps up the siding of the house one board at a time provides the contrast to the dark evil that lurks within the community.<br />I became thoroughly engaged in this novel, and sincerely hope that Grisham decides to try his hand again at this type of character-based novel.The town is all riled up after a brutal fight ended in a death.

Meanwhile, someone is secretively painting the weathered siding of the Chandlers' farmhouse one plank at a time. <br />Life on a cotton farm seems simple and placid, but the intrigue and emotions portrayed in this novel contradict that misconception. The characters are vivid and real. The details of everyday life in the farming community are extraordinary. What seems to be a simple novel about farming in the 1950's becomes a fascinating, absorbing tale of the daily struggle to survive. The pristine white paint that creeps up the siding of the house one board at a time provides the contrast to the dark evil that lurks within the community. <br />I became thoroughly engaged in this novel, and sincerely hope that Grisham decides to try his hand again at this type of character-based novel.	2002-06-11

Victoria &#34;Vic&#34; Savedge, a tall striking beauty beginning her senior year in 1980 at William and Mary, is dating handsome, football athlete Charly, who comes from a wealthy family. She is being urged by her mother R.J. and Aunt Bunny to marry him and settle into the typical role of a suburban matron.<br />But then she meets Chris, a young woman who has transferred from a college in Vermont and she starts to question everything, including her love for Charly. Their relationship quickly erupts into passion, and Vic is forced to admit that she is gay; however, she still contends that she loves Charly and can't bear to hurt him.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters includes Vic's best friend, Jinx, her precocious meddling little sister, Mignon, her quirky mother R.J. and various other outlandish, larger-than-life southern personalities. In spite of the eccentric characters and amusing incidents, the book plods on through Vic's tormented journey: will she choose Charly or Chris? It was difficult to relate to many of the characters, and two-thirds of the way through the novel I just wanted her to decide already and get on with her life. The events described in the Epilogue were actually more interesting than those that preceded it, and the novel would have been more interesting had some of those events been incorporated.	2002-05-26

The book begins with Rosemarie and Chucky just after they met with Lyndon Johnson. Chuck had been Ambassador in Germany during JFK's administration, and both he and Rosemarie still mourn the loss of their President and the end of Camelot. The novel explores their liberal democratic politics as well as their connection with the Catholic Church.<br />They marched at Selma and met with Martin Luther King. They were at the hotel when Bobby Kennedy was shot. They watched with horrid fascination the Kent State riots. They saw the Vietnam War unfolding on the nightly news. They stood by helplessly unable to protect their oldest daughter as she participated in anti-war riots. Chuck went to Vietnam to take photographs. They were beaten by police during a Chicago convention. Chuck continued to chronicle the times through his photographs and was the official portrait photographer of each President. Somehow, the O'Malley's seemed to have a front row seat for the turmoil of the 60's and 70's. No trend or event of the time is left unmentioned, including Vatican II, the feminist movement, hippies, drugs, and Woodstock.<br />The O'Malley's are known for their ebullience and love of life, with large, joyous family gatherings featuring much singing and dancing, and that side of the clan is seen frequently throughout the novel. Rosemarie and Chucky, who have known each other since childhood, are still deeply in love and are raising a happy family of 5 children. However, the book is at times somber and grave, as befitted the turbulence and civil disobedience of the civil rights movement and the most unpopular war in American history.<br />The O'Malley's suffer tremendously when their oldest daughter, April, decides to drop out of Harvard and abandon her capitalistic family and find her own way. They also endure the agony of worry when their oldest son goes to Vietnam.  Just when it seems that nothing else can go wrong for the O'Malley's, Greeley brings it all together for a satisfying conclusion and sets us up for the next installment which will be eagerly awaited by those of us who are following the trials and tribulations of the O'Malley's.nam.

All he knows about her is her first name, Liz, and the fact that she has left New York to visit someone in Palm Beach. So, with this meager trail, Stone is sent on Thad's private jet to stay on his yacht in Palm Beach while looking or Liz.<br />In one of many incredible coincidences throughout the novel he finds her right away, and she turns out to be the woman that Stone had rescued in St. Marks a couple of years ago, and who he believed to be dead. Stone helps her to settle with the insurance company who had paid the $12 million life insurance policy upon her husband's death and agrees to keep her secret from Thad.<br />In another recurring theme, suave, sexy Stone immediately attracts Thad's private chef and assistant, Callie, into his bed. Liz has also asked Stone to help her thwart a stalker who she believes to be her ex-husband, who supposedly had died on their boat in St. Marks. Stone is also being stalked by his ex-wife, Dolce, who has become dangerously psychotic. Just to fill up a few more pages of the novel, Stone's ex-fiance Arrington, now the widow of Vance Calder, appears on the scene reminding him of how close they once were. In just one novel, four of Stone's current and former conquests vie for attention.<br />Although I've enjoyed all of the Stone Barrington novels to date, Cold Paradise drags too many characters from previous novels into the plot and tries to find something for them to do. The coincidences and overlaps are too contrived to be realistic. It's time for Woods to retire Stone or at least let him shed some of his past and move on.	2002-05-12

Gail and Anthony are sort of engaged to be married, but in the last edition of this series, she threw his ring into a murky pond at the country club, and although they're still seeing each other, marriage plans are on hold.<br />Gail is approached by a dear old friend, who had been their housekeeper years ago, to handle the appeals for her grandson, Kenny Ray Clark, who had been convicted of the brutal stabbing death of a young woman 12 years ago. All of his appeals so far have been unsuccessful, and this is his last chance to avoid execution.<br />After just a cursory investigation, Gail realizes how flimsy the evidence was and is convinced that Kenny did not receive a fair trial and is innocent. Gail becomes obsessed with stopping the execution. Anthony tried to warn her not to become involved, because he knows her so well and realizes that she will be overwhelmed by the appeal process and her own emotions. But eventually, when he sees that she cannot be deterred, he agrees to help.<br />Gail also involves her cousin Jackie Bryce who is now a rookie cop in the police department headed by her father who was in charge of the murder case 12 years ago. When the execution date is set, the action and pace intensify as Gail races against time to discover who really killed the victim. There are many people who want the crime to stay unsolved and for Clark to be put to death, and none of them are happy with Gail's meddling and probing.<br />This legal thriller is provocative, well paced and believable, and I'll look forward to more installments in the saga of Gail and Anthony.	2002-05-05

During college she had been overweight and shy and had witnessed the rape of Connie Bryan, a beautiful classmate, engaged to be married immediately after graduation. Connie was terrified of her fiance's reaction to the brutal attack and made Jane swear not to involve the police or tell anyone. A short while later, Connie committed suicide and Jane has been haunted with guilt and felt she should have done something to help Connie.<br />Years later, Jane Lewis is a successful psychologist with a popular radio talk show, when an old college classmate, Michael Sorenson, introduces himself. Jane is now slender and beautiful but still thinks of herself as plain. She is immediately attracted to Mike, who is also a successful psychologist, and he encourages her to delve into the past to rid herself of the guilt she has suffered for so long as a result of Connie's death.<br />Trixie and Fred, Jane's godparents, the people she cares most about, are eccentric and endearing and funny. They are co-authors of a long-running, successful series of action thrillers. Trixie and Fred, as well as Jane, adore their dogs and treat them almost like human beings.<br />In her efforts to uncover the long-buried circumstances surrounding Connie's death, Jane becomes involved in some dangerous situations. Fortunately, with Trixie, Fred and Mike watching out for her she never strays too far into dangerous territory.<br />Although I enjoyed the plot and interesting characters, when the book delved into conversations with ghosts and visitations from long dead relations, it all got a little too silly and unbelievable to me. But, all in all, it was a light-hearted romance with a theme and a satisfactory conclusion.	2002-05-05

The expectations of a fledgling lawyer overwhelm her, and she wonders whether she can make the commitment to spending the rest of her working life as a workaholic.<br />I enjoyed and commiserated with the challenges faced by Becky and the way in which she faced them head-on and resolved them.

Lily's daughter died in an accident 7 months ago, and she has been depressed and distraught since then, but her brother and sister-in-law believe that she is not suicidal and that someone is trying to kill her.<br />The complicated plot involves Lily's second husband, who apparently is not as sincere and loving as he pretends to be, Simon Russo, art broker, and the invaluable paintings, now worth millions, left to Lily by her grandmother.<br />The subplot involving the counterfeit paintings is interesting and believable, and the developing relationship between Lily and Simon is worked out to a satisfactory conclusion; however the plot involving the kidnappings and the bizarre, evil woman who ruthlessly preys on innocent victims is incredibly weird and contrived and not well integrated with the rest of the book.<br />The author should have developed one plot or the other, but not both in the same book. Some of the characters are not well developed, the dialogue is stiff and contrived, and some aspects of the plot just plain silly.

Holly assigns herself to the case, but there is little evidence. Holly's father, Ham, retired Army non-com, accompanies her on a visit to a small town to follow a lead, and they find themselves at an unadvertised gun show in what appears to be a militia encampment.<br />Following a hunch that these people might be involved with the bank robbery, Ham, at great personal risk, infiltrates the organization, and they soon start to depend on him because of his expert marksmanship. The racist militia group involves Ham in a plot to assassinate a VIP, but he is aware all along of how expendable he is to them.<br />Stone Barrington, featured player in many Woods' novels, makes a few cameo appearances mainly to lend moral support to Holly, but disappointingly he has no major role in this novel. However, Ham and Holly (and her dog Daisy) are well-developed, strong and interesting characters who carry the plot well. I'm sure we'll be seeing them in other novels. The nasty, evil militia were too one dimensional and stereotyped to be believable, and I hope the next time Woods writes about Ham and Holly he gives them something more interesting to do.	2002-04-27

Aislinn Andrews returns home to her condo in Arizona one evening to find escaped convict, half-Navajo Indian Lucas Greywolf raiding her refrigerator. He had intended to be gone before she returned home, but now he had no choice other than to take her hostage. She is frightened by the hint of brutality and at the same time drawn to his raw sexuality. He resents everything about her, since she represents to him the white oppressors of his people. They flee across the state, avoiding police roadblocks, to their final destination, which is to be at the deathbed of his revered grandfather. When she sees him in his world among his people, Aislinn realizes that Lucas is not the cruel, unemotional criminal that he has portrayed.<br />Lucas is recaptured and finishes out his sentence. Since Aislinn chose not to report that he had kidnapped and held her hostage, his sentence was not extended. When he is released from prison less than a year later, his first stop is to visit Aislinn and thank her for not turning him in. The relationship that began through their chance meeting a year earlier is not over, not surprisingly, since the book is only half over.<br />Thus begins the next phase of their relationship, which is full of misunderstandings and surprises. They have so much to learn about each other and each has to set aside many stereotypes and biases to discover the person beneath the skin color.<br />Although the prospect of a woman falling in love with a man who kidnapped her and threatened her is highly improbable, I enjoyed this romance novel since it culminated in a happy ending for two people who were meant to be together.	2002-04-03

Lee Ramsey, long lost acquaintance from Kathy's teenage years, is back in town trying to rebuild her life as a newly minted lawyer. Lee, who doesn't realize that Marcie is the daughter of her old friend, Kathy, intends to build her reputation by prosecuting Marcie during her murder trial.<br />Kathy hires Scott Lazarus to defend Marcie. Scott, a successful big town lawyer who returned to the small town of Madison in upstate New York for the slower pace of life, is sincere and concerned about Marcie and believes in her innocence. He becomes a staunch ally of their family against the ugly allegations and threats from the community, and Kathy feels herself drawn to him and becoming dependent on him.<br />In an effort to make the main plot more interesting, the author also develops several sub-plots including the marriages of Kathy's best friends from childhood, Angie and her husband Joe, who are still happily married, and Ellen and Phil, whose marriage is falling apart. Kathy's unhappy marriage to Glenn ended years ago, and she remains bitter towards him. Glenn is more concerned about the impact of the murder trial on his career than he is about Marcie. All the subplots and the many characters that are paraded through the book but never well developed make it difficult to keep track of the main plot.<br />The search for Frank's killer gets ridiculously complicated with allegations that a local secretive militia group is involved, as well as money launderers and drug lords from Miami. It's all rather preposterous and improbable in this small, quiet town. By the end of the novel, I was relieved that the killer was found and all the loose ends were tied up.	2002-04-03

But, lately several large sums of money have disappeared from their checking account, and Dick is unable or unwilling to account for them. He seems at times docile, but still rules his roost with an iron hand and has never become accustomed to being a useless old retired man. Lily is a victim of her times, the self-effacing woman with no aspirations other than homemaker.  Ruth, their 40 year old daughter, is a single architect and ardent feminist who encourages Lily to exert her will and try to be less dependent on Dick.<br />After finding Dick under the bed with a gun one night, Lily reluctantly concedes to Ruth's urging to have him tested by a psychiatrist, who pronounces him manic-depressive. He is sent to a psychiatric hospital where he vacillates between a drug induced torpor and manic, dangerous, destructive outbursts. Rather than realizing how much better off she is without him, Lily becomes so lonely and depressed that she actually adopts a mouse as her pet.<br />Ruth, the classic sandwich generation, is torn between getting on with her life, trying to appease her demanding father, and trying to keep her mother from sinking further into her own depression.<br />The book provides some poignant, revealing insights into what makes a 50-year marriage work.

The novel travels backwards in time to re-discover the various times they have met over the years, finally culminating in their high school romance. The first third of the novel is very confusing because of the veiled references and illusions to some event in their distant past that caused them to lead separate lives, although it is obvious that they love each other and have probably always been in love.<br />The writing style is somewhat cumbersome. The author's habit of punctuating all dialogue with a dash followed by italicized letters, caused me to back track many times to figure out who was speaking. Sometimes the italicized letters were thoughts rather than spoken words, so I was occasionally confused about whether any dialogue had actually occurred.<br />The book finally started to get interesting when it revealed the time during which Linda and Thomas were both in Africa with their spouses and how they rediscovered each other after many years apart. Finally, the beginning of their relationship in high school was described, and the awful event that had been alluded to throughout the book that caused them to be separated.<br /><br />If you can bear with it and trudge through the first third of the novel, you will be rewarded with a story that is rich in detail, fascinating, troubling and poignant.	2002-03-19

From the moment Tyler Scott lays eyes on Hailey Ashton, the client relations manager at a popular and successful theme park that he owns in Tennessee, he sets out to seduce her. But, not surprisingly, their courtship is fraught with misunderstandings and false starts. Hailey doesn't think she is nearly as attractive as her perky younger sister, so thinks Tyler is probably more interested in her. She also believes that he just wants to use her as a babysitter for his 11 year old daughter.<br />Hailey lacks self-confidence and wants to be taken seriously as a career woman, and has had no fulfilling relationships with men in the past. She can't really believe that Tyler would be interested in her and is convinced that he just wants to use her. She has become very fond of his daughter Faith, who badly needs a feminine role model since the death of her mother.<br />Tyler's blatant and aggressive pursuit of his employee Hailey is a little far-fetched in today's litigious society. But, it's a fun, old-fashioned love story, and you're rooting for both of them to get together, because they seem so right for each other and they need each other so much.

Teddy sweeps her off her feet with a perfectly orchestrated dinner at his home, and she nods yes to his proposal when he hands her a giant diamond ring, all the while feeling that she has been backed into a corner.<br />Teddy has many ugly secrets, including his drug habit, affairs with other women and mismanagement of his client's assets. He is critical of Valerie's career and expects her to be devoted to him full time. Inertia seems to be the main reason that she hasn't told him she doesn't want to marry. But when Valerie meets Wyn Conrad, the reclusive owner of the Stonelair estate where she has been called several times to treat the horses and dogs, there is an immediate attraction and she finally starts to really question her engagement to the evil Teddy.<br />There are many who want to thwart Valerie's relationship with Wyn including his major domo, Santo Ducci, who believes he will inherit part of Wyn's estate, as well as Wyn's estranged wife, who is impatiently awaiting her settlement so she can keep her polo-playing boyfriend in high style. Valerie's mother is also opposed to the relationship and is trying to rush Valerie into marrying Teddy before she can change her mind.<br />There's plenty of intrigue, nasty people and graphic sex in this novel, but the evil Teddy seems just too wicked and Valerie seems just too perfect for them ever to have been in love or even attracted to each other. All the characters are either good or bad, with no gray areas, which makes the whole plot rather unbelievable.

Mirella's 1 hour commute into Boston leaves her little time for domesticity, and they have already been through a succession of nannies who didn't stay long.<br />Young, eager Randi McGill, referred by a local agency, shows up to interview for the position and they hire her immediately. She seems too good to be true...she cooks, cleans, does art projects with the children and forms a strong bond with Jacob. But this strong bond upsets Mirella because it seems to go beyond what a caring nanny should do, and threatens her own relationship with her son.<br />Glimpses of Randi's past start to give hints that she is not a pure and unselfish as she portrays herself. Her attachment to Jacob becomes unhealthy for both of them, and Mirella wants to fire her, but Howard insists on keeping her for a while longer since she has been able to get Jacob speak a few words. There are also some strains in the relationship between Howard and Mirella and secrets they are keeping from each other.<br />Mirella and Howard are not perfect parents or spouses, but are realistically portrayed as parents trying to do the best they can. The tension builds throughout the novel, and the reader is being set up to expect the worst. The climax is rather odd and unsatisfying. The early promise of the book is ultimately not realized because of the awkward ending.	2002-03-10

Her daughter, Bonnie, was murdered by a serial killer 10 years earlier and the body was never recovered. Her good friend from the Atlanta PD, Joe Quinn, is involved in a case where many bodies are unearthed near the Talladega Falls. One of the bodies is from a young girl who might have been Eve's daughter. Joe asks Eve if she would like to reconstruct the head from the skull and she jumps at the chance, because she still wants to bring Bonnie home and put her to rest.<br />The killer, who calls himself Dom, has become jaded and complacent and no longer feels any lasting thrill or excitement from his kills. He contacts Eve and reveals to her that he has another victim planned and gives her enough clues to track down Jane, a 10-year old girl in a foster home in Atlanta.<br />Thus begins a cat and mouse game that increases in intensity throughout the book. Eve knows that she is the bait for Dom, and tries desperately to locate Jane before he kills her. Once she has found Jane, Dom lures them to Phoenix where he claims his most recent victim is buried. They team up with a cadaver searching dog and his owner to try to locate the body in hopes that Dom has left some clues that will bring them closer to finding him and ending the spree of killing.<br />The suspense continues to build until the end of this well-paced thriller, and when the killer is finally exposed it's a shocking revelation.

She blurts this out to anyone who will listen, which quickly earns her the label of liar and kook. So she decides to keep her visions to herself after that. She can't summon the appearances of God, nor does she have any control over her healing powers, but her reputation spreads quickly throughout the small town of Canaan, North Carolina. Maggie bears her notoriety with grace and tolerance, but is always aware of how different she is from other people.<br />Maggie is being raised by her mother and grandmother, both strong, unique women. Granny is running the tobacco farm, and Maggie helps out when she's not in school. Her alcoholic father took off years ago, but shows up to borrow some money from Maggie when he learns of her famous gift. In fact, most of the men in this book are weak or flawed in some way. Granny is a delightful character, down-to-earth, warm hearted and practical, constantly spouting down home wisdoms.<br />Alex Barrons, a Princeton seminary student, shows up one summer when Maggie is in college, intent on interviewing Maggie as part of his summer research project on modern day mystics and visionaries. Maggie agrees to talk to him, and they become friends as the summer progresses. But when it's time for Alex to return to college, he admits that he has fallen in love with her. Maggie feels that she won't fit into his world, and feels violated when he reveals that he told someone else about her secret belief that God is a woman. Maggie refuses to read any of his letters while he is away, but her heart is broken and she can't forget about him and the bond they shared.<br />The book was a delightful study of small town folks, good people doing good deeds, misguided people doing harm to each other, religious fervor, the power of God's love, and the power of faith and forgiveness.

Dr. Riley has worked with other similar cases, including her sister Melissa who spent 6 years in the darkness of catatonia after witnessing the tragic death of her parents in an automobile accident. Melissa comes to visit Jessica and is involuntarily pulled into the treatment of Cassie by her mysterious extra sensory connection with the young victim. Michael Travis had risked his own life trying to save Cassie during the attack on her nanny, and has been asked by the President to help find those who preyed upon her.<br /><br />This is where it gets too confusing. Travis is involved in several illegal international money making schemes, none of which are described sufficiently to allow us to understand his motivations. The plot jumps from Amsterdam to Paris, back to Virginia, with none of the other nefarious characters properly introduced or integrated into the plot. As the body count and bloodshed mounts, and the pace of the game of international intrigue quickens, the tangled web of sub plots eventually strangles this novel.<br /><br />The only interesting and understandable sub plot is the developing relationship between Travis and Melissa. Hopefully, the author will jettison the rest of the characters and reintroduce Travis and Melissa in another novel.	2002-02-10

The book begins with Irene showing up at the Armstrong law offices in a tattered coat and hat, looking like a street person, having disappeared many years ago and presumed to be dead.<br />The book then back-tracks to uncover her past with Bella and their ragtag band of lads. Bella is a kind hearted but poor woman who helps out those worse off than she is by providing food and lodging for a pittance. She'll take in any decent person as long as they aren't violent or alcoholic. A mysterious, timid waif of a woman shows up in her yard looking like she had been homeless for a while. She is frightened, particularly of strange men, and almost mute, and Bella takes her in. She calls herself Reenee, but seems to have few memories or her past, and is often scared into a semi catatonic state. She proves to be a hard worker and becomes very dedicated to Bella and her lads and they gradually form a family of sorts.<br />The years go by and the mystery of Reenee's past is never solved, until one day the name of Dr. Baindor is mentioned in her presence. She decides to visit the doctor, who turns out to be the son she hasn't seen since he was 4. As her memory gradually returns, and she is reunited with her son, the sad and awful truth of her destructive years with Richard is revealed.<br />Bella is a loveable well-developed character, and the dichotomy of the richest and poorest classes is evident in this book as in other Cookson novels; however not enough of the inner thoughts and motivations of the main character, Reenee (the Silent Lady), are revealed until too late in the book to allow the reader to truly develop any empathy or understanding of her plight.	2002-02-02

Jon Krakauer, a writer and avid mountain-climber was sponsored by Outside magazine to join an Everest expedition and write an article. He joins a team lead by Rob Hall, who is very experienced, organized and professional in his approach to the business of guiding climbers to the top of Everest. Although written in the first-hand perspective, the central character in the book is not Jon, but rather the mountain itself, looming in the background, taunting and teasing the climbers, some of whom will abandon their quest just a few hundred yards short of the summit.<br />One of the most interesting trends revealed by the book is the commercialization of Mt. Everest. The government of Nepal sells permits to climb the mountain at $10,000 per person. The guides charge up to $65,000 per person and provide all equipment, supplies, guides and Sherpas to do the heavy lifting. All the customer has to do is walk up the mountain. The climbers range from dedicated athletes to rich thrill seekers. Jon was concerned about the inexperience of many of the climbers, and rightly so, because some of them perished on that fateful day.<br />The book describes in fascinating detail the preparations for the final summit as the group moves from Katmandu to Base Camp, then on to Camps One, Two, Three and Four. The process of acclimatization to the altitude and thin air takes 4-6 weeks to accomplish, and the skillful writing allows you to fully experience and understand the surroundings and fellow climbers as we accompany the group step by step to the summit at 29,028 ft.<br />The book is also replete with historical detail of past climbers, both successful and unsuccessful, and plenty of information about Nepal and the unique Sherpas. But this is all background information leading up to the long-awaited final assault that was scheduled for May 10th, a day on which the most favorable weather conditions were expected. The day was fraught with problems, from the late start, to traffic jams caused by 33 hikers attempting the summit on the same day, uninstalled ropes at the highest elevations, dead radio batteries, competition between guide groups, lack of cooperation between Sherpas, misplaced oxygen canisters and the omnipresent exhaustion caused by altitude-induced hypoxia.<br />Climbing Everest is a feat of such magnitude that few of us armchair adventurers can imagine the motivation, drive and willpower required to reach this goal; however, thanks to the skillful writing of Jon Krakauer we can experience vicariously some of the terror, pain, exhaustion, fear, anger, horror, exhilaration and sense of awe at attempting to conquer the inimitable Mt. Everest.a day on which the most favorable weather conditions were expected.

The author patterns the personalities of the three sisters after the Bronte sisters, imbuing them with Puritan sensibilities and a desire to become published authors. Wolf believes himself to be an enlightened, well-read governor of the colony, wielding a firm but fair discipline over the convicts on the island; but the sisters gradually are exposed to the crueler, despotic and controlling aspects of his regime and begin to plot against him to wrest from him some control of their own lives.<br />The Wolf sisters are in their 20's and 30's, however the Captain will not consider allowing any of them to leave the island, and they fear they have no marketable skills or way of supporting themselves in the real world.  Of course, their prospects for snaring husbands are limited to the officers on the island, none of whom have been particularly interesting or presentable, except for one who turned out to be already married. Fearful of their fate if their father is killed in the line of duty, they vow to write novels and achieve some notoriety and income.<br />Emily falls desperately in love with one of the Irish convicts who had been assigned to be her father's valet. When this infatuation is discovered, Wolf throws the main into solitary confinement. Wolf becomes increasingly paranoid and depressed and settles into a blight and malaise that prevents him from doing his job. The girls are fearful for their future, and Charlotte, the strong-headed leader of the group, works behind the scenes to get her father reassigned away from the island.<br />The pace of the action in the last chapters of the novel increase as the sisters are involved in an escape attempt and are caught in the violence of a prison uprising in which their home and many of their possessions are destroyed. The struggle of the sisters to thrive in the narrow confines of the life imposed on them by their father is commendable. In spite of their surroundings and limitations, they each become strong-willed, competent, educated young women, much like the Bronte sisters.

Herbert Mittledorfer, serving time for killing his wife, is determined to get revenge, and several of Stone and Dino's friends and associates have been killed. But the odd thing is that Herbert is still in prison.<br />As Stone and Dino work to unravel the mystery of how Mittledorfer is accomplishing his mayhem, Stone continues to be pursued by women and somehow rake in obscene amounts of money from his successful law career. Sarah, a former lover and artist returning from several years in Europe, moves back in temporarily with Stone, and they impulsively decide to purchase and furnish a cottage in Connecticut one weekend. But, just a few chapters later, Sarah is fleeing back to Italy after the gallery in which she is exhibiting her art is bombed...apparently another of Mittledorfer's attacks.<br />Enter Dolce, Dino's sister-in-law, daughter of a rich, powerful reformed Mafioso. Dolce gets her hooks into Stone (and his mattress), while the scent of the departed Sarah is still in the air. Dolce and her father are aware of the danger Stone finds himself in, and are attempting to help him sort it out, but their interference may be more of a hindrance than a help due to questionable tactics.<br />In spite of the intrigue, sex and violence, I was never as engaged by this novel as by the many other Stone Barrington sagas. The pacing was somehow off, some of the story lines too unrealistic, and the motivations of Mittledorfer too ambiguous and unexplored. However, even though this novel wasn't the same caliber as other Woods' novels, I'm sure I'll stay tuned for more Barrington episodes.	2002-01-27

Out of curiousity, Louise calls F. Scott, ostensibly to review his application, but they immediately end up as lovers. In some weird time-warp, Louise believes that he is her first lover from so many years ago, the one she never got over. Missy, who had stolen Scott from her years ago, somehow finds out about this new relationship, and gets involved. Although they're supposedly best friends, it seems her life-long goal has been to interfere in Louise's affairs.<br />Through some improbable plot twists and turns, Louise explores her relationships with Peter, Missy, the deceased Scott, her brother and her mother, eventually arriving at a better understanding of herself.

Their father is a Gentile, but their mother is a Jew, and the couple has been unable to obtain emigration papers. Caroline falls in love with Walter, a young German whose father is a known Nazi. She and Lore escape to Switzerland while awaiting their papers to emigrate to America. While they are in Switzerland, Walter visits frequently, their relationship becomes intimate, and Caroline discovers that she is pregnant. When they don't hear from Walter, Lore reports that he has become a Nazi soldier and they will never see him again.<br />Finally, their papers for America arrive, and they begin the journey with sad hearts because their parents still can't leave, and because Caroline is devastated by Walter's absence. Caroline is desperately sick during the entire journey, and when they arrive in the U.S. they are taken in temporarily by the Sandlers, a kind couple in New York, until they make their plans to move to Ivy, Wisconsin. The Sandlers introduced Caroline and Lore to young Joel Hirsch, another recent immigrant. Joel is smitten with Caroline, although the attraction is not mutual. When the news of her pregnancy becomes known, Joel proposes and everyone, including Lore, pushes her to marry him. She doesn't love him, but the shame of her pregnancy, and Lore's sudden announcement that she has cancer, force her into accepting his offer. After a small, subdued ceremony, they pack up and move to Ivy.<br />Thus begins the long, sometimes boring recital of the trials and tribulations of Caroline, Joel and Lore. Lore's \\"cancer\\" turns out to have been misdiagnosed, and Caroline continues to treat Joel with disdain.

Finally, after the U.S. joins the war, a local boy is killed in Pearl Harbor, and Caroline realizes she will never see her parents again, she admits Joel into her heart and bed, and their life begins anew.

The prose is too flat, and the characters not fully developed. The plodding style made it seem like reading some else's journal of the mundane events of their daily lives. The ultimate betrayal that is revealed in the last chapters of the book was somewhat foretold earlier in the book, but not well integrated into the plot, so seemed almost like an afterthought...as if the author thought she should throw in something more meaty and interesting after all. It was too little too late, as I was fairly bored with the \\"Legacy of Silence\\" by then.	2002-01-06

Hollywood will definitely want to create a cinematic thriller from this plot.<br />Joe Hickey, his wife Cheryl and cousin Huey have fine-tuned a kidnapping script and have preyed successfully upon 5 doctors' families before settling on Will, Karen and Abby Jennings as their next victims. Working as a team, Huey swipes the kid, Cheryl accosts the husband and Joe corners the wife. Their demands of only $200,000 are small change to the successful doctors they target, and their method is foolproof. Joe calls each of his accomplices every 30 minutes, with the threat to each of the parents that a missed phone call will result in the immediate death of their child. The wife is commanded to wire transfer the funds to a bank near the husband, who picks up the cash and delivers it to Hickey, while Huey is handing over the child to the mother. All of the previous victims have complied and have had their children returned to them safely. None reported the crime to the FBI.<br />However, things don't go quite so smoothly with the Jennings family. Hickey wasn't aware of Abby's acute juvenile diabetes, and his flawless plan is interrupted by the need to take Karen to her for a life-saving insulin injection. The tearful, agonizing parting scene when Karen and Abby are separated distresses Huey, Joe's big oafish mentally retarded cousin, who doesn't want to hurt Abby who has been kind to him.<br />Cheryl also runs into problems with Will. He is unwilling to sit around and do nothing, so uses the drugs he has developed as an anesthesiologist to weaken her resolve and extract some critical information from her. Will learns that this time Joe has a score to even up, since he believes Will was responsible for the death of his mother during an operation in the past year. He believes that this time Joe will kill the child, since it's the only way he can really get even with Will.<br />Karen fights back against Joe's rape attempt by slashing his thigh with a scalpel that she had hidden, and manages to send an e-mail message to Will's skytel pager. At the same time, the last victims have finally decided to report the crime to the FBI, and they start to narrow in on the criminals.

When I was 20 or 30 pages into the book, I kept asking myself, &#34;Do I really want to know more about this pedophile and how his victims coped with the abuse?&#34; But I plodded on anyway because the book is only 224 pages, and was ultimately rewarded for my patience.<br /><br />The story begins when Aphias Zhe, nicknamed Fee, a 12-year old part-Korean boy, is accepted into a prestigious boys choir. It is soon obvious to Fee that the choir director preys upon his choir members, but they're all too terrified or embarrassed to do anything about it. The book lurches from scene to scene with thankfully much of the sordid details left to one's imagination, but some of the prose is so ambiguous, with incomplete sentences and dangling thoughts, that my reaction was sometimes &#34;Huh? What did he mean?&#34;<br /><br />Eventually, the choir director is revealed, convicted of 12 counts of pedophilia and sentenced to a long term in prison. His imprisonment, however, does not end the torture of some of his victims. Two of Fee's friends eventually committed suicide, and Fee is tormented with memories, nightmares and the realization that he is also gay. He acts out in bizarre ways, rebels, and experiments with drugs and casual sex.<br /><br />Fee does eventually settle into a relationship with Bridey, and they move together to Maine to allow Fee to take a temporary teaching job as a swim coach at a small private school where coincidentally, Warden, the son of the convicted pedophile is a student. Warden develops a crush on Fee and it's starting to look like the pattern will repeat itself.<br /><br />In spite of the sordid plot, it is easy to empathize with the angst and soul-searching Fee endures in his quest to find his place in the world. The ending of the book was a satisfying conclusion to what was ultimately a very sad story.ad story.	2001-12-30

As with all her other novels, the story is woven around the sometimes mundane, ordinary lives of real people just trying to get along. Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather have been friends since culinary school and have decided to launch a catering business in Dublin. They have found several financial backers and, quite by accident, have managed to locate the ideal premises. After a whirlwind of remodeling and planning they are open for business. The referrals are slow at first, but they are gradually building a reputation as fine caterers.<br />Unfortunately, Cathy's husband Neil, a man passionate about his political and humanitarian causes, isn't particularly passionate about Cathy or her business. But she is so immersed with getting the business established that she hasn't noticed how they are drifting apart. Cathy is shunned by Neil's family because she comes from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\"; Cathy's mother has been cleaning house for Neil's mother for years. Tom's relationship with the beautiful vapid would-be model Marcella is also less than ideal, as she feels anything that furthers her career, no matter how sordid or unethical should be okay with Tom.<br />Neil's neglected 9-year old twin cousins, Maud and Simon, also add to the confusion as Cathy is often expected to take care of them. They have been abandoned by their mentally ill mother, wandering father and useless older brother, Walter. Cathy brings the children to her mother and father, who are poor in assets but rich in every way that counts. The waif-like children and their relationships with the other characters in the book are the most endearing aspect of the book.<br />This cast of characters is enough to build a very entertaining novel, but the author brings in many more characters, some of whom are not well developed and play only a tertiary role in the plot development. After finishing the novel several days ago, I have tried to analyze why it isn't as thoroughly engrossing as some of Binchy's prime novels, including \\"Circle of Friends\\", \\"Tara Road\\" and \\"Evening Class\\". My conclusion is that there are just too many characters. In the beginning of the book, sorting out all these characters is confusing and deflects your focus from the primary plot. The most rewarding aspect of immersing yourself in a Binchy novel is that you can totally fall in love with her characters; but in this case there were just too many of them.<br />Other reviewers have indicated their disappointment with this final novel from Maeve Binchy. I'm not as disappointed in this novel as I am devastated by the fact that she will write no more. I guess I'll have to start dusting off my copies of all her previous novels and rereading them so I can dwell once again in the fictional lives created by this master novelist.the plot development.

Joanna decides that she wants to build a grotto in an old barn on their property with shells that she has collected and approaches designer April Woodward to do the job. Joanna and April are instantly compatible and Joanna loves her ideas for the project.<br /><br />It soon becomes apparent, however, that Joanna has more than just this creative endeavor in mind. She is looking for a good friend and for a companion for Josh because she has discovered that she has terminal brain cancer. Neither Josh or April are aware of her disease, and she keeps it hidden until the symptoms are obvious.<br />To keep the story moving along, the author introduces the sub-plot of a competitor who is trying to buy the orchid business, which Josh and Joanna are unwilling to sell. Another sub-plot is built around the antics of Joanna's sister Christina who is a shallow, selfish slut, about as different from Joanna as possible.<br />Although the novel was meant to be a tear-jerker, I wasn't terribly moved by either the characters or the plot. The descriptions of the orchid business and the lavish grotto that Joanna and April are building are interesting and well researched, but the story seemed just too contrived. There was no mystery, and the ending could be predicted half way through the book.<br />If you want to lose yourself in a bittersweet love-story, this is the book for you as long as you can suspend your view of reality for the short time it will take you to read this 290 page novel.	2001-12-29

They are brave, young thrill-seekers in an elite club of only 400 smoke jumpers nationwide. Ed's girlfriend, Julia Bishop, decides to stay during the summer when she is offered a chance to work with a wilderness outreach program for troubled teens. She is crazy about Ed, but when she meets his best friend, Connor, there is an immediate attraction which makes both of them feel guilty and nervous. Connor's passion is photography, and he pursues it quietly during his time away from smoke jumping.<br /><br />In an attempt to save the life of Skye, an especially troubled girl who ran away from camp on Snake Mountain and was trapped by a raging fire, Julia endangers her own life and the lives of the smoke jumpers who try to rescue them. The tragic outcome forces Julia to choose between Ed and Connor, and their smoke jumping careers are ended.<br /><br />The second half of the book isn't about smoke jumpers at all, and takes on a completely different tenor, since it's about the settled, domestic life of Julia and Ed and their daughter. Connor chasing his own demons, becomes a photo journalist and accepts the most dangerous assignments in war zones and impoverished countries. Although he is the godfather of Ed and Julia's child, he disappears from their lives for many years. But Julia can never forget about him, and the connection they once felt.<br /><br />Although the second half of the book didn't live up the promise of the first half (or to the title), I enjoyed it nevertheless, because it wove a story of love and friendship, devotion and courage into a satisfying (if somewhat predictable) conclusion.	2001-12-16

Stephanie is looking for elderly, decrepit, cranky Eddie DeChooch who was caught selling black market cigarettes.

The scenes of inhumane, cruelty and bizarre sex among humans, ghosts and half-human animals were repelling and horrific. But somehow, I plodded on out of sheer curiosity or voyeurism. I wouldn't recommend this book for the weak of heart or overly sensitive person.

Katya still lives on the estate, in the guesthouse, but in some bizarre twist of nature, appears to be 30 years old, rather than her actual age, which is closer to a hundred. Todd is instantly drawn to her and she woos him He also soon discovers that the canyon is haunted with the spirits of the hedonistic movie stars of yore, and their lack of a corporal body hasn't dampened their libidos.<br /><br />The source of Katya's perennial youth and the attraction for the ghosts is a tiled room in the basement, imported from a Romanian castle in Katya's heyday. The tiles depict a hunt and tell many stories of depravity and blasphemy in Devil's Country. Incredibly, when the tiles were transported to the canyon and painstakingly reconstructed, they take on a new power in that anyone who occupies the room steps into the fantasy world.<br /><br />Enter Tammy Lauper, President of the Todd Pickett Appreciation Society, an overweight unsatisfied, obsessive housewife from Sacramento. After Todd's disappearance, she decides to pursue him and manages to trace him to the canyon.

Tory had special sensory skills that allowed her to see and know things that others could not. She had actually used her powers to help locate missing children during her years in New York. The mystery of the brutal death of her childhood friend still plagued her, and was part of the reason she was returning to Progress. She was also attempting to confront and banish the lingering sense of failure and fear instilled by her father.<br />When she arrived in Progress to open up an artistic gift shop, she immediately caught the eye of Cade Lavelle, the older brother of her former friend, Hope. Cade was attracted to her, even though she brought back painful memories of his younger sister. Hope's twin sister, Faith, is the bad girl in the plot with her flamboyant, lazy ways and string of failed marriages.<br />The book is populated with unique and interesting characters and quaint depictions of small town life. Tory's vow to solve the mystery of Hope's death provides a level of intrigue and suspense that serves as an interesting back-drop for the burgeoning romance between she and Cade.

This alternating story line gets confusing at times and bogs down the progress of the novel.<br /><br />As the years pass, Olivia tolerates Kwan's sometimes unwelcome advice and intrusion into her life. They see each other frequently, and when Olivia decides to divorce her husband Simon, Kwan begs her to reconsider. Olivia and Simon agree to accept a photo-journalism assignment in China, and travel together with Kwan to visit the village of her birth. The plot gets rather jumbled with visits from ghosts, more storytelling by Kwan, and Simon and then Kwan getting lost in a cave. But the ending is startling and finally brings together all the loose ends of the plot. Hang in there until the end and you'll be glad you did.	2001-09-21

She witnesses an apparent drug deal on her property and attempts to report it to the local police and to the senator who lives next door, but everyone seems to be trying to sweep it under the rug and deny what she witnessed.<br />Stella is a 30ish \\"spinster\\", as unlucky in love as her 90 year old aunt who also occupies the plantation. Stella meets undercover U.S. Marshall Garrett Shaw at the local tavern, and is instantly drawn to him, even though she believes him to be as untrustworthy as the other low-lifes who hang out at the strip joint. The plot gets even more exciting when Garrett is revealed, shot by his pursuers, and runs away to turn up, you guessed it, in Stella's plantation, looking for shelter. She takes him in and nurses him back to health, and in the process falls head over heels for him, even though she isn't totally convinced that he really is an undercover cop.<br />While some of the dialogue was silly and trite, the plot was nevertheless fun and interesting, and of course, had a happy ending...a romance novel with a theme and moral.	2001-09-21

Set primarily in Argentina during WWII, with some scenes in Germany, Secret Honor is filled with what could have been an interesting blend of romance and intrigue. Cletus Frade, an American OSS officer, marries Dorotea in Argentina and becomes the Patron of a vast Argentine ranch. He is an accomplished pilot, and befriends a German officer, who also manages to fall in love with an Argentine woman. Cletus is also involved in a plot to subvert the Germans in their attempt to use Argentina as a refueling/retrofitting stop for their submarines.<br /><br />As a piece of historical fiction, the novel brought interesting insights into the involvement of Argentina with Germany during WWII; however, the detail of many evil German officers, their blind devotion to The Fuhrer, and the litany of what officer reported to whom, and their rank and titles, etc. was boring beyond belief. I kept waiting for something big to happen, and it never did.<br />I have been a fan of Griffin for many years, especially his Brotherhood and Corps series, and expected a much high caliber of character development and fluid plot progression than was evident in Secret Honor. I slogged through the book only because I kept recalling how engaging some of Griffin's earlier books had been, and thought that this one would &#34;kick in&#34; at any time. I won't give up on this author yet, but this was not the Griffin I had learned to savor.	2001-09-11

There's something for everyone in this novel, but the author invested so much of her own experiences, I wonder if she has anything left to contribute to subsequent novels.<br />Warren is a professional psychic, raised in a wealthy family who only partially accepts his gay lifestyle. He is suddenly saddled with raising his sister's French bi-racial 8-year old daughter, Juliette, after his sister admits herself into an asylum in Paris.  Although he is totally unprepared for this role, he adapts quickly to it and learns to love Juliette totally. The central theme of the novel is Warren's volatile relationship with Flip, 13 years younger, struggling actor, and the love of his life. After much angst and soul searching Warren and Flip decide to pledge their troth to each other, and many humorous scenes are built around their \\"wedding\\" planning.<br />Flip's sister Rosie is also struggling to come to terms with her love relationship with a much younger man of a different ethnicity. She is also a determined union activist and struggles with some serious health problems. I found the chapters relating to the clerical workers strike at the university to be overdone and boring, and some skillful editing could have made this section of the book more concise and entertaining.<br />The structure of the book, which was told in multiple voices, allowed you to have insight into the perspective of multiple characters, and was a useful device until the chapters relating to the strike. Moving rapidly from the voice of one character to another character, none of whom were adequately fleshed out, was confusing and tedious.<br />But, all in all, the book was amusing, quick reading and gave some fascinating insights into New York, the gay life, the theater, and the behind the scenes union organizing. A little less detail in some areas could have shortened it somewhat and made the pace more brisk.detail in some areas could have shortened it somewhat and made the pace more brisk.	2001-09-04
US	51958405	R3AX5DBFUVLCP9	0312866100	316049814	Never Leave Me	Books	1	7	8	N	N	Never Read This!	Set in New York City in the early 1950's, \\"Never Leave Me\\" is about a man on the make, Brad Rowan, owner of a small, independent advertising firm. Brad is given the opportunity to go to work for a major steel company as their public relations executive at a tremendous increase in salary and perks. However, he finds the aggressive tactics and ethics of the CEO, Matt Brady, questionable, so he turns down the offer. This refusal is ironic, since Brad himself has exhibited many self-centered, unethical traits also. The book flits from scene to scene, with little character or plot development and little attention paid to detail. I was constantly wondering whether a day or month had passed between scenes. How did Brad manage to fall hopelessly in lust with Elaine Schuyler the moment he met her? Why does he instantly forget about his loving, devoted wife Marge? Why does Matt Brady set out to destroy Brad's business by forcing all his clients to cancel their contracts? Why does Brad's assistant Chris jump ship and go to work for Matt Brady? Although I know the setting was New York City in the 1950's, the references to women as dames and babes really wore on me. The steamy sex scenes were too graphic, and in some instances, physically impossible. This tale of \\"lust and greed\\" has no redeeming qualities other than its brevity (268 pages) and the fact that Brad eventually returns to his happy family.	2001-08-26

Cecile comes from a wealthy family and was raised with many privileges and is the first to marry. Amanda agrees to marry Norma's brother, Larry, even though she's not sure she really loves him, and Norma remains single for a long time but finally marries one of her fellow school teachers. The novel seeks to answer the question of whether the bonds of friendship forged in their early years can stand the tests of time. The novel alternates between telling the story of their lives from the perspective of each of the 3 women, but the book is lacking in character development and I never really felt that I knew any of them well. Amanda is self-absorbed, selfish and uncaring of her devoted husband and ultimately betrays him in the worst possible way. From the moment of her betrayal, I could see no possible way for a satisfactory ending to this novel but I plodded on until the end anyway. \\"Looking Back\\" chronicles in a plodding, uninspired manner the many sad and frustrating experiences of the characters, and is simply not the caliber of writing I have come to expect from Belva Plain, one of my favorite authors.	2001-08-26

But he is powerless in the face of the grief he feels as a result of the recent death of his wife, and feels helpless at consoling his four-year old daughter, Annie. He decides that they will return to Natchez for a while to live with his folks and let his kind and gentle parents help them try to heal.<br />But when Penn returns to Natchez he immediately becomes embroiled in the long unsolved murder of a black man at the local battery plant over 30 years ago. The family felt that the case had been swept under the rug and never properly investigated, and Penn commits to re-opening the case. With the help of the sexy, intelligent editor of the local paper, Caitlin Masters, Penn gradually uncovers the web of intrigue, scandal, lies and deceit that have kept this crime unsolved for so many years. The web extends to retired police officers, former FBI agents, and even the head of the FBI.<br />The numerous plot twists and turns are fascinating, riveting and absorbing. The 'quiet game' refers to the fact that many people involved with this long-ago crime just decided to keep quiet about what they knew out of fear or bribery or disinterest. Penn describes Natchez as 'funky, gossip, sex, whisky and eccentricity, all behind a gossamer veil of Southern gentility', and it is clear that the Civil Rights movement isn't over in Natchez. Penn also rehashes his relationship with his high-school love, Olivia, who suddenly decides to move back to Natchez and whose father is also involved in the murder and scandal that Penn is investigating.<br />Love, sex, violence, intrigue, danger, redemption and finally, justice...all are represented in great quantity in this novel which will keep you enthralled until the last page.	2001-08-26

She starts an investigation that causes her to traipse around the globe following the business dealings of the rich and powerful Winthrops.<br />The subplot of the novel is Danas difficulty in raising the traumatized one-armed boy she adopted from Bosnia during her coverage of that brutal war, and her faltering romantic relationship with co-worker Jeff. The intent of the subplot is to humanize and flesh out the main characters, but the dialogue and narrative do little to bring these characters to life. The dialogue is sparse and wooden, and its difficult to get a feeling for the personalities of the characters or to empathize with them.<br />Long before the plot to kill the Winthrops is revealed, the reader figures out who is behind the whole ugly conspiracy, so theres not much to look forward to in the waning pages of the novel other than getting it over with.<br />However, the conspiracy is awesome (if not particularly realistic) in its complexity, and the manner in which Dna eventually unravels all of the clues is interesting and entertaining. The Sky is Falling is not one of Sheldons best novel, but fairly entertaining and interesting.	2001-08-07

Erik was in a tragic auto accident at the age of 7 that killed both of his parents and left his face so hideously scarred that he chooses to live his life in the confinement of his home, from which he rarely ventures forth. He is a successful architect, and meets Marisa after completing a remodeling job on her father's home. His partner and housemate, Raskin, handles most of the public interface.<br />Marisa starts to sneak out of her house late at night to meet Erik, and initially their relationship is platonic. However, their passionate response to each other eventually leads to intimacy. Marisa told her father that Erik was giving her music lessons. Marisa's dad dies of a massive heart attack, and soon after she turns 18, she marries Erik.<br />Thus begins a cloistered life style lived in the seclusion of their dark home. Marisa and Erik have no social life outside their home, and they do not travel or even go out in the daylight because of Erik's fear of being ridiculed. Marisa wants to have children, but Erik is afraid to subject them to the shame and derision of having such a badly disfigured father. This eventually causes a rift between them that requires the help of friends and a chase across two continents to sort out.<br />The unrealistic setting and situation of these characters makes it difficult to develop any empathy toward them, since it is difficult to imagine living such a secluded, cloistered life. However, I did want both Marisa and Erik to eventually find happiness, which of course they did.	2001-08-07

She is incoherent and distraught but is afraid to go to the police, so Phil Aylmer takes her home to clean her up and tend to her wounds. He calls her mother, Jacqueline Evannier, who comes over immediately. Sadly, Emma dies in her mother's arms. Jacqueline is grief stricken and turns to the arms of Phil for consolation and their grief quickly turns to passion.<br />Over the next few days during the funeral preparations, Jacqueline becomes more and more dependent on Phil, who is 13 years younger than her, and he quickly professes his love. She thinks she loves him also, but realizes that she is in no condition to commit to any sort of relationship with him. Jacqueline is a former ballerina who was also scarred and traumatized by a rape 10 years earlier. She decides to push for more compassionate handling of rape victims and enlists the support of an old friend, Viktor, in this quest.<br />The relationship between Jacqueline and Phil seems highly improbable, and I was never actually convinced that it would work out. The theme of older woman, younger man appears in other novels by this author, but in this case it seems implausible. Jacqueline eventually sorts out her feelings for Phil, and starts to realize some success in her campaign for rape victims' rights.<br />The characters aren't as finely crafted, empathetic and believable in this novel as in other of Allen's novels, but there are lessons to be learned in the handling of rape victims and the healing power of love.	2001-08-07

My dusty, yellowed copy was first read over 30 years ago when I was in high school, and has been passed along to both of my daughters who also had to read it in high school. Since my 15 year old is reading it now, I decided to re-read it and remind myself why I kept it around all these years. Obviously, my perspective has changed, but the most remarkable feature of the book is its sheer timelessness. Holden didn't have to deal with the temptations of illegal drugs, or AIDS, or the frantic pace of the internet age, but all of his feelings of depression, loneliness, and teenage cynicism are still a part of the coming of age of our youth today.<br /><br />The antics of Holden after he is expelled from prep school are hilarious, frightening and heart-warming. He goes to New York City, gets drunk, smokes pack after pack of cigarettes, has a near-close encounter with a prostitute, gives away some of his dwindling hoard of cash to two nuns, calls up old girl friends, and generally fumbles and stumbles his way back to the safety of his home where all is forgiven. He's basically a good person at heart, but can't stand the phoniness and emptiness of the lives of many of the people around him.<br /><br />The stream of consciousness thinking and dialogue make you feel like you're in Holden's head. With just a few changes of scenery and dialogue, the book could easily be applied to living through the teen years in 2001. \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is a powerful, significant portrayal of a troubled young person, and it will surely remain on the required reading list for many years to come.	2001-08-07

Joanna James is a highly successful world-traveling photojournalist who is assigned to ride the Orient Express and spend 5 days at the sumptuous Cipriani Hotel in Venice. The trip commences in London, where her solitary existence is disturbed by a passionate fling with a casual acquaintance, Tyler, and just days later with her charming, British agent of 10 years, Henry. She leaves town feeling that she needs to escape from both of them to sort out her confused feelings.<br />Joanna meets the beautiful Lucienne, owner of a popular Paris bistro, on the train and they become immediate friends, sharing meals and long, revealing conversations. She also meets a dear old couple celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, and a precocious, captivating 14-year old boy who helps her discover Venice. People seem drawn to Joanna because she is attractive, friendly and inquisitive. However, she doesn't see herself in such a positive light, and is rather lonely and insecure.<br />The author's descriptions of the Orient Express, as seen through Joanna's eyes and camera lens, are fabulous in their detail. It's easy to imagine yourself riding along in the cosseted luxury of this world-famous traveling hotel. The scenes in Venice are equally compelling and fascinating. In the 5 short days that Joanna is in Venice, she manages to form deep friendships, have an impact on the lives of others and sort out her feelings about both Tyler and Henry. Her sincere interest in others, her inner turmoil, and her insightfulness make her a heart-warming character with traits worth emulating.<br />Dream Train is another satisfying, entertaining novel by Charlotte Vale Allen. I haven't been disappointed with any of her books yet, and plan to continue working my way through all of her novels.	2001-07-22

If you don't know what a forensic anthropologist, you will soon find out in gruesome detail that it involves sorting out flesh and bones from crime scenes. Since the author has the same background, the lab and morgue scenes are grisly, almost nauseating, in their detail, but probably extremely accurate and realistic.<br />Tempe is assigned to the cases of 2 bikers killed in a bombing, and the death of a little girl caught in the crossfire in a biker-related \\"gang warfare\\". She is assigned to the task force to track the crimes and activities of the outlaw motorcycle clubs (OMC's). What follows is a very detailed rendition of the history and structure of motorcycle gangs, which is frankly more than I ever wanted to know about the phenomenon.<br />Tempe's teenage nephew, Kit, isn't getting along with his parents, so decides to visit her for a while, and coincidentally becomes very interested in Harley's and the OMC's. Tempe tries to steer him away from that dangerous subculture, but fears that his fascination is too strong for her to overcome. Her attempt to save him from his \\"deadly decisions\\" places her in a very dangerous situation also.<br />The novel is filled with amazing coincidences and overwhelming detail, but nevertheless, you grow to like Tempe and Kit. Many of the other characters are poorly defined and difficult to connect with. And, of course, the sub-human motorcycle club members only inspire you to want them all to kill each other off. Kathy Reichs is compared to Patricia Cornwell, but doesn't have her finely honed ability to create characters and plots that engage you and leave you wanting more.	2001-07-22

Roman Matthews is understandably devastated by the loss. Sarah had always seemed distant and cold to Rome...he thought of her as the \\"ice queen\\", secure in her career at his firm and not seeming to need anyone, but he was attracted to her nonetheless. But the truth is that she has always loved him, and had to keep her distance from him in order to avoid revealing the truth and damaging her friendship with Diane.<br /><br />Rome invites her over to the house to pick up a carton of pictures and memorabilia when he decides to finally clear out the belongings of his dead family. In a moment of anguish, his passion flares and they almost succumb to the long-repressed feelings for each other. He admits that, since Diane's death, he has had sex frequently with other women, but has never been able to sleep with them because that would be a violation of the memory of Diane. Sarah is shocked by this revelation and confused by what almost happened between them.<br /><br />Rome and Sarah, both still locked in their grief, start to see other as friends, and the relationship gradually deepens, although she knows she can never compete with Diane's memory. In a fit of jealousy, and to protect Sarah from the amorous intentions of Max, the newest partner in the firm, Rome asks Sarah to marry him. He agreed to let her maintain her independence and career, and she accepted the fact that he probably didn't love her, but she wanted to be with him anyway.<br /><br />Their marriage is filled with passion but many misunderstandings as they both avoid confronting their true feelings for each other. When Sarah discovers she is pregnant, he is horrified and asks her to have an abortion...he never wants to have children again and endure the pain of losing them. Of course, she decides to keep the child (why else would be the book be titled Sarah's Child?), and their marriage is further strained by this decision. The ending is predictable, but satisfying.<br /><br />Plenty of emotional scenes, steamy sex and touching revelations will keep you turning the pages of this novel. Although other readers gave the book mixed reviews, one has to have certain expectations for a romance novel...they're not particularly realistic and the characters are not truly three-dimensional. Given those limitations, it is a quick, satisfying read for a lazy summer afternoon.ng is predictable, but satisfying.

On the day of the funeral, an unwed teenage mother shows up at her door dragging an emaciated, filthy little boy named Jesse and claiming that according to her birth certificate copy, Kyra is actually her mother and that the boy is Kyra's grandson. Of course, Kyra knows that it can't be true because she is sterile. Kyra and her husband have tried unsuccessfully for years to adopt a child, and now that he's gone, she has nothing to show for their 10 years of marriage. The unwed mother insists that she can't keep the boy and tries to thrust him upon Kyra. Even while she is denying any relationship, something about the sad, neglected little boy reaches her heart, and she agrees to sign the papers on the spot and take custody of Jesse.<br />Soon after her adoption of Jesse, Kyra decides to move back to London to be near her family, a fascinating set of characters from a renowned British theatrical family. Her mother is a famous actress, her twin brother Kyle an up and coming actor, and her father a director. Kyra is in the business too, as an award-winning costume designer. Kyra is an exceptional and unusual mother, and Jesse is an extraordinarily perceptive and precocious child who wins the hearts of all who surround him instantly.

She has experimented on cadavers, but still feels that the robot is not ready for use on live human beings. However, her overly ambitious and politically minded department head, Dr. Gilbride, goes against her wishes and operates on a famous Olympic gymnast, and the operation is a success, bringing worldwide attention on the Medical Center.<br />The attention focused on the Medical Center results in a media frenzy and hope that a large grant will be made to further the research. Jessie strikes up an improbable relationship with Alex Bishop, a security guard at the hospital, who we later learn is a renegade CIA operative. Bishop believes that Eastern Mass will be chosen by the evil mercenary Claude Malloche as the site for the life-saving brain surgery that he desperately needs. Bishop has been pursuing the elusive Malloche for years and feels that entrapping him at the hospital is his long-awaited chance to capture him. Of course, Bishop hasn't told Jessie any of this; she thinks he's just a former Marine, now hospital security guard that she may be falling in love with.<br />The descriptions of the surgeries performed by Jessie are fascinating in their detail, and her warm, caring relationships with her patients are very humanizing. As the plan of Malloche and his equally evil followers to utilize the robot to repair his tumor is revealed, the plot of the book becomes a little far-fetched, but is so fast paced and interesting that it's easy for the reader to suspend disbelief and be swept along in the action.<br />This fast-paced thriller will engross you until the last suspenseful page.	2001-06-24

Fallon is the son of paraplegic Mike Fallon, a policeman who had been shot in the line of duty 20 years earlier. Sam had a lot of respect for Mike, and was the one to inform Mike that his son had apparently committed suicide. Mike was devastated, but also angry at his son who had recently announced to his dad that he was gay. Kovac also visits Fallon's brother who runs a bar and bait shop out near the lake, and quickly discovered that there was no love lost between father and son, since Mike had long favored Andy, and held him up as a constant example to his brother.<br />Kovac and Liska are perfectly suited to each other as partners, and work well as a team, and both are suspicious that there was more to this suicide than met the eye. They were even more convinced when the autopsy was rushed through at the request of some high-ranking police official, the death was considered an accident, and the case was quickly closed.<br />Kovac tries to learn more about the cases that Fallon was working on in the Internal Affairs division but runs into a stone wall in the form of the implacable division Lieutenant, Amanda Savard. He learns through other sources that Andy had been working on a case involving harassment of gay policeman within the department, but the case had been recently closed when the leads dried up. On the day of his son's funeral, Mike Fallon is discovered dead in his bathroom after apparently blowing his brains out. Some details about the crime scene just don't seem to fit the suicide theory that is quickly applied to Fallon's death, so Kovac and Liska continue to investigate.<br />The strongest sub-plot is the lonely and unconnected existence of Kovac. Divorced twice, he has no relationships outside the police force, and knows how being a police officer affects every aspect of your life. But he's basically a good person, and never loses sight of who he works for...the victims. He is finally able to connect with Lt. Amanda Savard, but sadly, that relationship also ends.<br />As Kovak and Liska dig deeper into the recent deaths and old crimes, their lives and careers are threatened, but they never lose sight of doing the right thing. The plot gets rather complicated with intertwining sub plots and faceless characters, but in the end when it is all sorted out, the ugly truths of corruption and bigotry and greed within the police force are exposed. And the deep bond of trust and friendship that is formed between partners on the police force is strengthened even further.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced, intense well-written novel, and am looking forward to reading other titles by this author.he's basically a good person, and never loses sight of who he works for...the victims.

The youngest daughter took off for Europe as a teenage and never returned. The older daughter is trapped in an unhappy marriage that was arranged for the benefit of the family fortune. The patriarch, Jimmy Lee, controls and manipulates the family in a ruthless, relentless manner. It is clear that he (or someone) is using bribery, blackmail and threats to weaken Paul's opposition.<br /><br />Bo is exiled to the back woods of Montana, supposedly to diminish the chances of embarrassing the family during one of his drunken episodes. However, Bo has kept contacts within the Warfield firm, and knows that the funds are being badly managed.

Marcus Glenwood is rebuilding his life and legal practice after the tragic death of his young children and the divorce from his wife. He is asked to represent the parents of Gloria Hall, who believe she has been kidnapped in a prison-like shoe factory operated by New Horizons in China.<br />With little physical evidence and not much on which to build a case, Marcus goes to court against the massive New Horizons, which seems to have tentacles and connections everywhere. New Horizons will stop at nothing to keep their secrets intact, and Marcus is threatened, beaten and attacked in his quest to expose the reprehensible practices of this monolithic company.<br />The descriptions of labor practices in China paint a horrendous picture of inhumane treatment and are very timely in the current political climate. The legal intrigue surrounding Marcus' quest to reveal New Horizons' is fascinating in its details. But the real story here is the integrity of Marcus, Gloria's parents, the judge, and many other secondary characters who are deeply committed to doing the right thing.<br />Bunn is also a master at skillfully building believable and empathetic secondary characters. Long before the book is over, you feel like you know these people and would like to spend more time with them.<br />A fascinating story, well written, very entertaining, very informative. T.

Charles Cronin O'Malley is called \\"Chucky Ducky\\" by Rosemary, the love of his life, and they were practically raised in the same house, following the death of her mother. She is his best buddy and confidante, and their marriage seems inevitable to everyone around them, except Chucky himself. When he finally realizes how important Rosemary is to him, he is swept along into the planning for a Christmas wedding when they are still in college, but he continues to doubt the wisdom of the marriage right up until they enter the church. Rosemary, normally gregarious and optimistic, is sometimes haunted by memories from her past, and falls into bouts of despair and drinking.<br />Just before the marriage, she admits to Chuck that her father sometimes molested and raped her, and her mother did nothing to defend her. Chuck thinks he can cure her by loving her and providing the stability and warmth that she never received as a child. She is Chuck's confidante, coach and agent, and encourages his photographic career. He eventually becomes a famous, world-traveling photographer, but there are many stormy, tense periods during their marriage, and they gradually drift apart.<br />Set in the early 1950's throughout the 1960's, the book gives a fascinating and probably accurate picture of the choices facing women in terms of career, family-planning and their place in society.

Jane lashes out at Oliver and strikes him on the face and she is so horrified at her violent streak that she bolts from their house in San Diego with nothing but her daughter and a handful of clothes. She fears she has become just like her abusive, violent father.<br />After driving aimlessly for a while, Jane stops and calls her brother Joley who works on an apple farm in Massachusetts. Jane and Joley are soul-mates and best friends, and he guides her across the country in a series of letters which are sent to post offices in towns that he thinks she should stop in.<br />The book is told through the voices of Oliver, Jane, Rebecca, Joley and eventually Sam, the owner of the apple farm. Jane and Rebecca share many adventures and soul-searching conversations while on the road while Jane tries to fathom what has gone wrong during their 15 year marriage. She was so in love with Oliver when she first met him at age 15 and married him at age 20, but now he seems only to care about his whales and his career. He barely knows his daughter, and has been out of the country for 7 or her 14 birthdays.

Stone Barrington, a New York City lawyer and former cop, finds himself stranded on the tropical island of St. Marks when his girlfriend is unable to join him for a long-awaited cruise on a rented yacht. But there's no time for loneliness or boredom to set in because of the arrival of Allison Manning. Allison sailed her yacht into harbor and was immediately accused of the murder of her husband while they were at sea. Her story of his fatal heart attack and burial at sea is plausible, but the authorities don't believe her. She is accused of murder even though there is no body, no murder weapon and no motive.<br />Stone immediately takes pity on Allison and agrees to represent her; however, since he is not qualified to try a case in the British legal system, she is also represented by an aging local barrister. The bizarre legal system assumes that she is guilty, and the penalty is death by hanging, so the stakes are very high. The local authorities are also corrupt and are eager to make an example of her. Stone knows that the case must receive lots of public attention in order to focus the eyes of the world on the grave injustice about to be done, so he calls a press conference and obtains exclusive interviews with \\"60 Minutes\\" and other news shows.<br /> Right from the beginning, there are plenty of reasons to doubt Allison's motives and alibi, and Stone pursues some independent investigation into her background. He also falls head over heels \\"in lust\\" with her and they spend most of their time together in bed.<br />There are plenty of plot twists and surprises right up until the end of the book, and just when you think you've got it figured out a new angle surfaces.

He is only about 3 or 4 years old and obviously terrified. A disreputable-looking man comes looking for the child, but Bobby immediately senses something amiss when the boy cries out in terror. They refuse to turn over the boy, and in the fight that ensues, Bobby accidentally kills the intruder. Not knowing how to handle such a situation, they pack up and flee home with the boy. Susan is so desperate to have a child, that she becomes delusional and unrealistic and wants to keep him and pretend that he is their child. This is where the book descends too far into unreality. You can't just pick a child from the \\"lost-and-found\\" and keep him. The parallel plot line of the terror his real mother feels at losing him is heart-wrenching and far more plausible.<br />The true criminals are incredibly stupid, and have gotten involved with some really bad guys, and Bobby and Susan's welfare is increasingly precarious as the criminals track them down. The plot becomes almost like a Keystone-cops routine, and somehow I was never truly convinced that they were in mortal danger.

What a wonderful surprise! The book weaves a rich tapestry of the separate lives of three sets of characters in the woods and farmland in the Appalachians. For the first third of the book or so, the three parallel story lines are each interesting but seem to bear no relationship to each other; but gradually loose threads are picked from each story line and woven into a whole that symbolizes the richness and complexity of people and natural surroundings of this region.<br />Deanna Wolfe is an aging, reclusive scientist who has accepted an assignment with the Forest Service to live in a remote cabin and rebuild trails. Through her eyes, we are exposed to the wonders of nature and the awe with which she treats the environment. Her passion (and her doctoral thesis) is the study and preservation of coyotes; Eddie Bondo, a much younger man, hikes into her life one day and opens her heart, but she is constantly suspicious of him because he believes coyotes should be shot since they threaten farm animals.<br />Lusa is a recently widowed young woman thrust into the life of a farmer when she inherits the family farm from her husband. The rest of the family is slow to accept her, and her unconventional ideas about farming do nothing to bond her to the family or the community. But she gradually finds a way to win them over, and learns to love the land and make a success of her farming ventures while others are struggling.<br />Garnett and Nannie are long-feuding elderly neighbors, who continue to keep their distance from each other more out of old habits than for any definable reasons. Witnessing the gradual dismantling of the barriers between them is amusing and heartwarming.<br />The ending was unusual and seemed abrupt, but after thinking about it a while I realized that the masterful novelist has left each of us to write our own endings.

Her mother refuses to believe that her daughter could embarrass the family by calling off the wedding at such a late date, and continues with the wedding plans as if nothing had changed. Her parents try to manipulate her into changing her mind, and even go so far as to hire a psychiatrist who reports back the results of their session to the parents.<br />Since the groom, Mark, is out of town working on a trial, she hasn't been able to break the news to him. The ironic thing is that they seem perfect for each other. He adores her, sends her flowers all the time, and understands her better than anyone she has ever met. They are both intelligent, articulate and share a love of literature. Lily is devoted to Jane Austen, and the book is punctuated with literary allusions and quotes from Jane Austen's books.<br />One of the reasons why Lily doesn't want to marry Mark is his family. His father is overbearing and his sisters are jealous meddlers. But the main reason is the potential loss of her self. All the women in this small town in Ohio are defined by their husbands...they are simply Mrs. So and So...if you're not married, you're nobody. And forget trying to have a career! The women should do \\"good works\\", work for the charity league and run carpools. She sees her life closing in on her, and yearns for the sophistication and freedom she enjoyed while living in New York.<br />The book is light-hearted, witty, amusing and charming and the surprise ending will please any reader. It was a quick, fun read; not deep thought-provoking literature, but nonetheless entertaining.	2001-04-08

It's as much a travelogue as a fictional novel.<br />The story begins with the brutal slaying of Charles St. Claire in the one-time slave cabin on his property. His wife, the beautiful and famous Hollywood actress Remy LeLourie, is found with his blood-covered body in her arms and her thumbprint on the caning knife that was used to slash him to death. Her one-time lover, New Orleans detective Damon Rourke is assigned to the case. He is reluctant to believe that she is guilty, and as other murders and bodies litter his path during the investigation, the case gets more and more complex.<br />The story alternates between flash backs which help to describe why the characters act the way they do now, and the present scenes, which are full of mysterious plot turns and unexplained nuances. All of the characters are complex and are not what they appear to be at first. The ending is surprising and brings together all the loose ends and justifies the actions of many of the characters.	2001-04-01

Cassandra de Warenne is an intellectual writer of historical fiction who spends her time living in a quiet English manor with her beloved aunt and niece. She is raising her niece for her wild jet-setting sister Tracey who works for Sotheby's. Cass is introduced to Tracey's latest boyfriend, Antonio,  at a formal dinner and is instantly smitten with him. Antonio de la Barca is also an historian, and Cass had attended one of his lectures several years earlier. But that's not all they have in common. Their families, the de Warennes and de la Barca's have a long, tangled and bitter history. Cass' aunt warms her to stay away from Antonio, but she can't believe the dire warnings she hears and is drawn to Antonio in spite of her aunt's warnings.<br />Cass, Tracey and Tracey's daughter go to visit Antonio at his crumbling castle in Spain, and that's when the intrigue and bloodshed and danger becomes magnified. That's also when I started to lose interest. The ghost of Isabel, who lived in the castle 450 years ago, stalks her descendants, wreaks havoc with their emotions and inhabits Tracey's body while committing unspeakable acts of violence and brutality.<br />I realize that reading any fictional novel requires \\"a willing suspension of disbelief\\", but I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that Isabel could drive a truck and run someone down, shut off the electricity, cause spontaneous combustion, and generally try to maim everyone in her path. The budding love affair between Cass and Antonio was completely overshadowed by the wrath of Isabel. The author did not achieve the proper balance between romance in suspense in this novel, which should have been titled \\"House of Horrors\\" rather than \\"House of Dreams\\".	2001-03-17

At only 225 pages, with large typeface, the story kept me enthralled for one rainy, gray afternoon in February. As the book jacket says, the author possesses a deep understanding of what it means to be human, to be alive. Sarah Strickland and her best friend, Calista have been best friends, almost sisters, since childhood. They share every intimate detail of their lives. Calista married the best friend of Sarah's husband, Gavin. Calista and her husband already have a child, and Sarah wants one, but Gavin is not ready, so a conflict between them is set up, even though they seem to have a great marriage otherwise.<br />Finally, Gavin agrees to start a family and they are both ecstatic when Sarah becomes pregnant. Then tragedy strikes and the bonds of friendship between Sarah and Calista are sorely tested. Although Calista does her best to help Sarah through her devastating loss, they grow further and further apart. Sarah starts a friendship with a new neighbor who coincidentally has suffered a similar loss, and this causes jealousy between Sarah and Calista.<br />The author's ability to explore the depths and heights of human emotion and suffering are impressive. This book will make you laugh and cry and totally empathize with all the characters. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.	2001-03-11

Mary became the wife of Jonathan Gray and took up her life in the Minnesota wheat fields. They lived a quiet, placid, hard-working life working on the farm that Jonathan inherited from his parents. Jonathan's brother Aaron shares farming duties and lives in the house with them, since the house was his inheritance. They seem to have a satisfying life, but after 7 years of marriage, Jonathan and Mary still haven't had a child.<br />Their childlessness starts to cause a strain on the marriage, and Jonathan finally realizes that the mumps he had as a child probably made him sterile. However, he is aware that his brother Aaron was not similarly affected by the disease. He suddenly announces to Mary and Aaron that he would like them to procreate to give him a child. Mary and Aaron are stunned by this news, and a previously happy household becomes strained and filled with unspoken fears and concerns. The relationships between all 3 of them becomes strained.<br />Jonathan leaves for a weekend to purchase a prize bull to start a new herd, and the uneasy relationship between Mary and Aaron ignites into passion. The outcome is predictable, as Mary becomes pregnant immediately, and when she announces it to her husband, no one discusses the fact that the child is Aaron's. Mary is wracked with guilt, and her relationship with Aaron seems beyond repair.<br />Without spoiling the ending, Mary finally learns the true meaning of love and is able to put back together the pieces of her life.<br />The author does a wonderful job of describing the rhythms of farm life, and the never-ending chores of being a farm wife. Although the role of women in the early 20th century was essentially subservient, Mary is truly a tower of strength and the one who makes the farm work with her never-ending toil.

Dr. Claire Argent has been brutally slain and her eyes gouged out, and the M.O. is similar to another recent murder, so Delaware is put on the case along with his sidekick Detective Milo.<br />Dr. Argent's place of employment, the Starkweather prison for the criminally insane, is of course the first place they decide to look for clues. One of the lowest functioning inmates, Ardus Peake, was convicted of killing his mother and the family she worked for in a brutal, inhumane manner, and the eyes of some of the victims were also gouged out. However, Peake is barely alive and hasn't left the hospital for 15 years. Delaware and Milo begin their search in the workings of the hospital and other hospital employees to try to unlock this mystery.<br />The detective work and psychological analysis is interesting and fast-moving as they dig for clues long buried in the past. The pace quickens near the end of the book as they hone in on the suspected killer and try to prevent him from killing any more victims. The depictions of crime scenes are gruesome and the inner workings of the killer chilling, but the reader is left satisfied with the conclusion in that Delaware and Milo get another killer off the streets.	2001-02-25

His deceit is uncovered by U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who offers Robbie immunity if he cooperates in an elaborate FBI sting operation to net all of the guilty judges. Feaver is represented by his attorney, George Mason, who is the primary narrator of the novel. The choice of narrator is sometimes confusing because the book alternates between his first-person narrative and the omniscient observer point of view when Mason is not present in a scene.<br />The FBI sting includes a fictional lawyer and a deep cover agent, Evon Miller, who masquerades as Robbie's paralegal and latest in a string of girlfriends. Evon becomes an integral part of the sting as she becomes inextricably woven into the daily professional and personal life of Robbie.<br />The legal maneuvering is detailed, intricate and sometimes so hard to follow that it becomes rather boring. The real core of the story is the peculiar relationship that develops between Robbie and Evon. She wants to hate him, and he gives her many reasons to do so; but she also sees his human, caring side particularly when he is caring for his wife who is dying of ALS. This dichotomy between the reprehensible, lying, skirt-chasing Feaver and the loving, sincere husband is sometimes stretched beyond believability.<br />The overly complex plot, like the sting operation, starts to fall apart in the last part of the book, and the ending, while dramatic, is somewhat anticlimactic. Not one of Turow's best efforts, but a challenging and interesting read nonetheless.	2001-02-25

(It was assigned in two of my MBA classes.) At just under 300 pages, it provided only a high-level overview of marketing, and in some cases, the information was stale and outdated. The illustrations and charts are also rather crude and unsophisticated and sometimes downright difficult to interpret.<br />The only good thing was that it was quick and easy to read, but I didn't really absorb much new knowledge. As a supplement to a curriculum that uses case studies extensively (which is the recommended usage of the book), it is adequate. Each chapter concludes with a section listing Additional Readings, which are probably necessary if you want to really increase your knowledge of the subject.	2001-01-29

Slywotzky and David J. Morrison is that we learn from experience by studying patterns.  Good managers are skilled at strategic pattern recognition and see the whole picture.  Industries are reshaped by patterns, which may build slowly or move rapidly, and the ability to recognize and capitalize on these patterns allows an organization to create strategies that lead to sustained value and profitability. In his article titled &quot;Crafting Strategy&quot;, Henry Mintzberg, another well known author on the subject of business strategy, indicates that a &quot;key to managing strategy is the ability to detect emerging patterns and help them take shape. The job of the manager is not just to preconceive specific strategies but also to recognize their emergence.&quot;<br />Part I of the book is titled 'The New Game of Business' and describes the changes occurring in business which call for a new skill set.  These changes are called Getting It, Polarization and Mindshare. Getting It refers to the ability of managers to become masters of pattern recognition. Instead of seeing chaos, these managers see the strategic pattern unfolding within the complexity, and discover the pattern behind it all.  In short, they &quot;get it&quot;. Polarization is the result of early recognition and exploitation of patterns in that the company that &quot;got it&quot; first realizes great momentum, its market value explodes and value is no longer proportional; it has polarized. Many examples are given such as Cisco vs. Bay Networks, Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi, and Nike vs. Reebok. Polarization means &quot;winner takes all&quot;, and is spreading to other industries. The focus of competition in more and more industries is competition for mindshare, and is crafted as a three-part strategy: 1) mindshare with customers, 2) mindshare with investors and 3) mindshare with talent. Getting It, Polarization and Mindshare are critical skills in the war for dominance in an industry.<br />Part II of Profit Patterns describes thirty patterns that have affected business designs over the last two decades. The patterns are organized into the following categories:<br />o Mega - No Profit, Back to Profit, Convergence, Collapse of the Middle, De Factor Standard, Technology Shifts the Board<br />o Value Chain - Deintegration, Value Chain Squeeze, Strengthening the Weak Link, Reintegration<br />o Customer - Profit Shift, Microsegmentation, Power Shift, Redefinition<br />o Channel - Multiplication, Channel Concentration, Compression/ Disintermediation, Reintermediation<br />o Product - Product to Brand, Product to Blockbuster, Product to Profit Multiplier, Product to Pyramid, Product to Solution<br />o Knowledge - Product to Customer Knowledge, Operations to Knowledge, Knowledge to Product<br />o Organizational - Skill Shift, Pyramid to Network, Cornerstoning, Conventional to Digital Business Design<br />Numerous examples are given of the patterns, and case studies of successful companies such as Nokia, Dell, and Cisco Systems show how a company can detect patterns and trends, organize around them and create significant value, even polarization, from these patterns. The case studies, since all are well known companies, are very useful in understanding the patterns and comprehending how they can be applied in real-life business situations. This infrastructure of patterns can be used to organize and correlate the relevant experiences of well known corporations to your own organization. The patterns are equally applicable to large corporations or small-to-midsize companies.<br />Part III of Profit Patterns is called 'Putting Patterns to Work' and includes chapters on putting the patterns into action(company case studies), accelerated pattern detection, putting the patterns to work in your organization, and a patterns workbook. This is perhaps the most useful section of the book, in that it offers practical advice on applying the pattern thinking theories.<br />&quot;Profit Patterns&quot; is written in a practical, thorough, no-nonsense style and the theories are backed up with many real-world examples. I will definitely use the workbook section in the future to analyze business patterns and strategies. The authors are prolific, respected writers, and this book will become one of the staples of business literature. My only criticism is that the graphics are crude and unsophisticated and that a more professional approach to the graphics would lend more credibility and clarity to the concepts they illustrate.(company case studies), accelerated pattern detection, putting the patterns to work in your organization, and a patterns workbook.

Hugh's relationship with his son, Jamie's father, was strained and Jamie didn't even speak to his parents for years after moving out. The squalor and futility of Jamie's parents' lives is depressing and all too real.<br /><br />However, I couldn't finish the book to find out whether these relationships were ever healed or resolved. I found the writing style just too tiresome to slog through at times. The terse, staccato style with too many incomplete sentences and paragraphs just left me frustrated and wondering \\"what is he trying to say?\\" The Scottish slang and phrases and too many metaphors also left me puzzled at times. Here's an example from page 44 of the book:<br /><br />\\"My thirst for the sea. I know of a home I have never known. A liquid bed by some easy beach. I know it well in my sleep. The coast is unclear. The landmarks are ruined or new. Yet water knows nothing of nations. It is called after them - is claimed by them - but water is only itself.

The protagonist, Luke Lucas wakes up one morning in 1958 in a bus station with a hang-over, dressed like a bum, and not knowing who he is. Through many scrapes and close calls he steals a car and a fresh set of clothes, breaks into someone's house to take a shower and change, and starts relentlessly pursuing any clues to his past. He walks through the halls of Georgetown University hoping someone will recognize him and tell him who he is! How believable is that?<br />The reader is lead through a series of flashbacks to Luke's pre-war days at Harvard and parallel scenes at the rocket launch site in Cape Canaveral, and is thrust into the tension of the U.S. vs. Russia space wars of the late 1950's.  Each chapter is introduced with a brief statement about the various phases of rocket design, which doesn't really add any useful or interesting information to the book. Luke gradually uncovers the secret to his past and why he has been subjected to his drug-induced amnesia. The reader figures out who the \\"bad guys\\" are long before the end of the book, but you're never really sure why they became bad guys in the first place. The novel could have benefited from a more thorough character development of some of the critical players.<br />Not one of Follett's best books, but that's not much of an indictment since some of his earlier novels are among my perennial favorites, including \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and \\"The Key to Rebecca\\".	2001-01-28

The story opens when she is 10 during a summer in their Victorian castellated house built above the rocky mainland shore. The Dunbeg castle, a crumbling old wreck built nearly 150 years earlier by her great-great-grandfather O'Malley, has its share of family ghosts and legends. Aine's cousin from America, Rupert - her father's brother's son, visits them for the summer, and she finds a rare ally in him even though he's several years older than her. While her brothers ignore her or taunt her and her parents virtually ignore her, Rupert finds time to talk and explore with her, and achieves a real rapport with Aine. They continue to correspond when he returns to Virginia.<br />The women in this novel are all deeply troubled and unfulfilled. Aine's mother is distant and troubled by her lack of power in her typical Irish marriage where the man rules the roost. Rupert's mother has a similar marriage, but it's further complicated by the fact that her husband is a pedophile and philanderer. Both seem trapped and helpless in their marriages, which creates negative examples of female vulnerability and dysfunctional relationships for Aine.<br />Aine is haunted by unexplained nightmares, shadows and visions, and is constantly criticized and ostracized by her family for her imaginings; but only Rupert seems to understand her. They don't see each other again for years, when she is 13 and he is leaving for college. An awkward and uncomfortable event causes a rift between them, and they lose communication for several years while he is away at college. They meet again when she is an adult and attending drama school in London, but he is engaged and she is angry and disappointed in him. She agrees to marry Nigel soon after meeting him in London, mainly as a negative reaction to Rupert's engagement.<br />Aine's intense feelings for Rupert are eventually resolved in a surprising manner, and she eventually faces her demons and ghosts and learns how to deal with them.<br />The themes of oppression and haunting are mirrored in the splendid, vivid descriptions of the Dunbeg castle and rocky seashore and of the humid, sultry surroundings in Virginia. The author allows us to empathize with Aine and be fully engaged with her environs.

Will is also threatened with a sexual scandal for a brief liaison with a movie star years ago; and to place him in even more jeopardy, he is the target of a remote militia group assassin, for no apparent reason other than he is a politician.<br />Woods does a masterful job of building suspense and weaving together various sub-plots. The short chapters are well-paced, and move effortlessly between the different scenes and sub-plots. However, some of the sub-plots are never resolved and are left dangling. What happened to Ed Rawls in the Atlanta State Penitentiary who seems to have mysterious powers over politicians and former CIA colleagues? Some topics and plot elements are introduced and then dropped, which leaves you with an incomplete feeling by the end of the novel. After weaving a complicated and intriguing plot, the writer seems to lose interest in some of the characters and just drops them.  In spite of these loose ends, \\"The Run\\" was a quick, satisfying read, and I will definitely read some of Woods other books.	2001-01-15

Peter managed to wipe out most of Laura's considerable assets, but she still has the home and a job working in one of the Templeton hotels. Her life is hectic and overscheduled, but basically lonely.<br />Enter the dark, mysterious, brooding Michael Fury. Raised nearby but on the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\", Michael had been a good friend of Laura's brother, Josh, but had left the area right after high school to live a life of danger and adventure. Michael is back in the area, raising and breeding horses, but his stables and home were destroyed in a mudslide and Josh convinces Laura to let Michael rent her unused stables until he can rebuild.<br />Having married Peter at 18, Laura has little experience with dating or flirtation, and has compartmentalized and organized her life, leaving no room for dating or passion. When Michael strikes her a spark in her, she is confused and in denial, but he pursues her relentlessly. He is charming, sexy, good with animals and wonderful with her two daughters.<br />The usual misunderstandings, protective family, meddling friends, and circumstances attempt to thwart their romance, but after all this is a romance novel, so you know the guy gets the girl in the end. I didn't realize that the book was part of a trilogy, but the characters and scene are so captivating that the book stands alone and is a quick, entertaining, satisfying read.	2001-01-15

Unfortunately, Annie's biological clock is ticking so loudly that all other conversations are drowned out. Only 45 days into their relationship they are having absurdly boring, circuitous arguments about her need to get pregnant and his unwillingness to commit. These passages in the book make me itch to get past them and on to something more interesting. Page after page of \\"what if\\" and \\"why won't you\\" and \\"let's wait\\"...so boring and so overdone.<br />However, the book is thoroughly redeemed by the other subplots. Will's nephew Teddy is taking a year off college (actually he flunked out), and is living with and working for Will as a sort of apprentice. His humor and advice and relationship dilemmas are amusing and heart-warming.<br />Will is also pursuing an eccentric, reclusive author who is procrastinating on submitting his Civil War historical fiction novel for which he has already received a $100,000 advance. Will's antics to track him down and extricate the manuscript are sometimes hysterical and provide a vehicle for an interesting exposure to the publishing industry.<br />And if that isn't enough, Will receives a letter from a 20 year old girl, who purportedly wants Will to review her journal, but she broadly hints that she thinks he may be her father. Thus starts a protracted, poignant inner dialogue regarding Lucy, the long-lost love from his teenage years.<br />Will's personal journey into an evaluation of his past, why he is still single at 41, why he thinks he doesn't want children, and how he feels about the possibility of being a father to a grown daughter are mostly interesting and realistic. Just speed read through the sections where he and Annie discuss their relationship ad nauseam, and you'll be pleasantly surprised and well entertained.	2001-01-08

Their daughter, Kim, is also aware of the tension between her parents, and has a distant relationship with her often absent father. Mattie is considering having an affair of her own to \\"get even\\", but can't really bring herself to confront Jake.<br />Jake chooses to leave Mattie to live with his mistress, but then they Mattie is diagnosed with ALS, a fatal disease that could end her life in as little as one year. This situation causes great stress on all of the family members, and Jake eventually decides that the right thing to do is return home to live with Mattie and care for her as long as she needs him. What he hadn't counted on is falling in love with her.<br />Mattie, Jake and Kim struggle with their emotions and their feelings for each other, and Kim acts out by punishing her father in any way she can, while trying to deal with all the other pressures of being 15 years old.<br />The emotions described in the novel are real, and the primary characters are well developed. The story is compelling, and the reader develops great empathy towards the Harts and their predicament. I so wanted this book to have a happy ending, and in a way it does, although you know from the outset that there's no cure for ALS.<br />The First Time is a sad, but somehow uplifting story with a real message that in the end all we have to give to others is love.	2001-01-06

The story begins with Troth Montgomery, half Chinese, half-Scottish bride of Kyle Maxwell, arriving in England to inform his family that he was shot and killed in a prison in China. The story alternates between present and past, with the present being late 1832 in England and the past being earlier the same year in China.<br />Kyle was completing his world travels in China, and was entranced by a young male translator who turned out to be a female (Troth) in disguise. She was used as a Chinese/English translator and spy on the visiting merchants, and was frustrated by her double-life. In exchange for financing her passage to England, he convinced her to lead him into the inner country where foreigners were forbidden. He was captured and taken to a prison. When he found that he would be shot to death, he impulsively agreed to marry her in a private Scottish ceremony in order to ensure her safe passage to England.<br />Troth returns to England and was accepted by his family, but never felt that she fit into their society. Since the book is only half over at this point, we realize that something else must happen in order for Troth to find happiness. Shockingly, Kyle returns to England and reports that he was severely tortured in prison, but not executed. Troth feels that she must release him from his commitment to marry her, since she believed he only did it out of kindness and not out of love. Thus begins the miscommunication and confusion that plagues the couple until the eventual happy ending.<br />The story is told on two continents and the settings are beautifully described with enriching cultural details. The inevitable love scenes are steamy but not tawdry, and both of the characters are so deserving of happiness that you really want this to have a happy ending, which, of course, it does.t you really want this to have a happy ending, which, of course, it does.	2001-01-05

The setting is Arizona in the town of Grace, which is an apt name for the Native American inhabitants who seem so at ease with their heritage and surroundings.<br />Codi Noline is a drifting 30-year old who decides to return to her home town of Grace to teach at the local high school for one year after abandoning her goal of becoming a doctor just short of completing her residency. Her soul-mate younger sister has gone to Nicaragua to help teach soil and crop management techniques. Codi misses her terribly, and they have a spirited and interesting correspondence.<br />Codi is also somewhat estranged from her father, Doc Homer, who is the town's only physician and now suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She revives her friendship with an old high-school flame, Loyd Peregrina, who is an Apache railroad man, and one of the most sincere and philosophical characters in the book.<br />She only plans to stay in Grace for one year and then move on, which is her way of avoiding planning for the future or making permanent attachments to people. The flashbacks, dreams, stories and legends of Animal Dreams explore Codi's relationships with herself, her father, her sister and the people of Grace in an endearing and memorable way.<br />The finely crafted prose paints a vivid picture of this beautiful country and the serene, peaceful people of Grace. Codi's journey of self-discovery is woven into a suspenseful love story which will leave you feeling in a state of Grace.	2001-01-01

Set in early 20th century England, the lives of the mostly female characters proceed at a slow pace, with much dialog but little action. However, this is probably true to the times. Thea's father walked out before Thea was born, leaving her mother, Belle Lawrence to raise her. They lived in Thea's grandmother's home in quiet poverty and desolation. One day Thea comes home from a visit to her Aunt's home to find that her mother has left her for the prospect of a sunnier climate and work in France. Her life becomes even more desolate without her mother to brighten her days.<br />Thea finally visits her mother in France, but her short-lived happiness is destroyed when her mother is killed in an accident. Thea returns once again to her dreary life in England with Nan (her grandmother). After suffering through more deaths in the family, Thea finally meets a man to love, Paul Bruner, but since he is German, he is interred for the interminable duration of the Great War, and once again, Thea is desolate and eternally seeking happiness.<br />The book really seeks to answer the question &quot;Will Thea ever find someone who can bring her security and heal her from the searing rejection and loss she has known in the past?&quot; As you approach the end of the book, you wonder whether this will really happen. The only thing that kept me reading this slow-moving, boring book was wondering whether someone could really survive such a dreary, depressing life.	2000-12-31

She finds it difficult to live up to the expectations of her &quot;perfect&quot; aunt and uncle and their &quot;normal&quot; children. Fiona is now 30, and her recklessness, unfounded trust in people, and poor judgment has earned her a reputation as an impulsive flake. She apparently sleeps with every man who crosses her path, and the book opens with her waking up and not knowing who is in her bed.<br />But in spite of her poor judgment and many mistakes, Fiona is basically a good person and wants to help people. There is a real dichotomy between her basically good inner self and her outward appearance and actions. She is working as a waitress in the town diner, but wants to complete her education, so is taking a night class at the local college. She is surrounded by men who use her in so many ways. Patrick Grady is cruel and unstable as a result of injuries in Vietnam, and she believes him to be her father. Todd Prescott is her longest relationship (since high school), but he is wealthy and spoiled, and is constantly getting bailed out by his parents. George Grimshaw is the loyal and steady friend since high school, and former boyfriend of her cousin Elizabeth. She also becomes involved with Rudy, her cousin's fianc&eacute;. Her uncle Charles is a respected and prominent judge and is always helping out others, but can't seem to give Fiona the love and support she really needs.<br />The intricacies of the relationships between all of these people make for interesting reading. You keep wondering what dilemma Fiona will find herself in next, and how she can extricate herself. The situation with her alleged father, Patrick Grady, deteriorates and becomes frightening, and the mystery of who he really is and his motivations will keep you engrossed until the end.	2000-12-31

The whole book was the inner dialogue of a black kid at State University chasing girls, playing ball, and occasionally doing some homework. There was a little interaction with his &quot;crew&quot;, and a little dialogue with his various one-night stands and girl friends, but no plot at all.<br />It was only curiosity that kept me reading until the end. Is that what a black man's life is really like? Do college kids really jump into bed so indiscriminately? On page 79 in one of Tony's inner ramblings he says &quot;Kicking it to some girl out of convenience. That's what I think that brother Ra was doing, 'cause the girl he was talking to wasn't even all that cute.&quot; Well, now I've opened up my mind and read some of the modern black literature, and I think I'll just skip it next time and read some real literature that engages your mind and maybe even teaches you something.	2000-12-23

The one with the most to lose seems to be Judge Nate Harris who is expecting to be nominated to the Florida Supreme Court and retains Anthony Quintana as his lawyer. Ballet dancer Bobby Gonzales is also a suspect, and his girlfriend Angela (also Anthony Quintana's daughter) asks lawyer Gail Connor to represent Bobby.<br />This book is third in the Gail Connor/Anthony Quintana series, and in this book they've recently broken off their engagement and both are depressed and angry about the way their relationship ended. Their work on solving this case thrusts them together, and they reach an uneasy truce in their working relationship. They struggle to uncover the facts surrounding Roger Cresswell's life and death, and find that the Cresswell family had plenty of skeletons in the closet, and any one of them may have had a motive to kill Roger.<br />This legal thriller has plenty of plot twists and intrigue and will keep you guessing almost until the brutal end. The legal challenges as well as the emotional roller-coaster of Gail and Anthony's relationship will keep you involved until the end and looking forward to the next book in this interesting series from Barbara Parker.	2000-12-20

The book opens with a grizzly scene when Dr. Hector Perez awakens to find himself next to a dead prostitute clutching three 1991 quarters. He quickly eradicates any evidence of his presence and goes back home to his pregnant wife.<br />Next, we visit Bobby Emmett in the Wallkill State Correction Facility. Bobby is an ex-cop who was imprisoned for the murder of his girl friend, Dorothea; however a body was never found, and Bobby was obviously framed. Prison is not a good place for an ex-cop, and he is taunted, threatened and assaulted with constant banging on the steel bars. Bobby is visited by a sleazy lawyer, Izzy Gleason, who is just getting off a one-year bar association ethics committee suspension, and wants to restore his reputation by re-trying Bobby's case.<br /><br />When Bobby starts to investigate his case, he finds that evidence was suppressed and there was a conspiracy among police and lawyers who are involved in a big-time scam to approve three-quarter pensions for corrupt cops. He is convinced that Dorothea is still alive, and his efforts to locate her and uncover the scam place him in constant peril.<br /><br />The dialogue is gritty and vulgar, and the level of violence and corruption is frightening. The line between the good guys and the bad guys is blurred, and lives are cheap and quickly extinguished if they interfere with the ambitions of the corrupt cops. The plot is riveting, and the tension of not knowing who Bobby's real allies are keeps you turning pages rapidly.	2000-12-15

Rain is raised by a step-family, with many tragedies of their own. Then she inherits most of the fortune of her Grandmother Hudson, which incurs the wrath of her real mother and the vicious, demented Aunt Victoria. She seems to have no friends in the world other than the family chauffeur, Jake. And Jake is not exactly a role model with his lonely life and chronic alcoholism.  Another close family member dies tragically, then Rain is paralyzed in a riding accident, and she becomes Aunt Victoria's victim after moving back home. If you've read other V.C. Andrews novels, you know that there will eventually be a happy ending, but getting there is a torturous route.<br />The writing is sometimes laughable, such as the following line at the end of Chapter 5: &quot;Maybe it was a combination of everyone tossing his or her self-interest into the fragile boat of love, sinking it in the sea of tragedy we were destined to cross together.&quot; I was also annoyed by the many typographical errors; for instance, the word &quot;panty&quot; was used instead of &quot;pantry&quot; and the psychologist's name was changed back and forth from Dr. Snyder to Dr. Synder multiple times. An attentive editor with a sharp pencil should have caught these inconsistencies.<br />This book reminded me why I stopped reading V.C. Andrews several years ago...unreal, poorly constructed plots and predictable endings after convoluted ramblings through the land of insanity and cruelty.	2000-12-12

This is Montana, the vast, wild west where the men are MEN and the women are well, um, not very believable or useful.<br />Ty Calder was not raised on the vast Triple C ranch owned by his father Chase Calder, but comes back as a teenager to learn ranching and how to survive in this sometimes inhospitable land. He learns a lot from the tough, single-minded ranch hands and his father and also from Jessy O'Rourke , a tom-boy with a crush on Ty. Ty goes away to college in Austin, where he develops a fixation on the beautiful Tara Lee, who is the daughter of one of Chase Calder's business associates.<br />The men are constantly getting into brawls, or getting drunk, or considering infidelity; and the women are either quiet, timid help-mates, or femme fatales, or, like Jessy, trying to emulate the real men. A typical line is when one of the ranch hands says of Ty's sister, &quot;Cat has some growing up to do; She's still too spoiled to make a good wife.&quot; I suppose he's got to break and brand her before he can marry her!<br />The dialogue is sometimes pretty sappy, such as when Ty's father says &quot;You can only afford to have one mistress outside your marriage, Ty. And that mistress is the land. She'll give you all the satisfaction, and heartache, that you can handle.&quot;<br />In spite of the subservient roles played by women, and the stilted, unrealistic dialogue, I was intrigued by the plot and curious how Ty would resolve the conflict between his passion for Tara and his need for the solidity and understanding of Jessy.	2000-12-04

A strange incident at the Hoover Dam thrusts Taylor and Turtle temporarily into the limelight and they appear on the Oprah Show, where they are noticed by Annawake Fourkiller, a lawyer and member of the Cherokee Nation. Annawake decides that Turtle belongs among the Cherokee people rather than being raised by a white woman, and thus begins Taylor's panicked flight to escape the prospect of losing Turtle.<br />Some very interesting characters inhabit the book, but none of them are particularly realistic. Taylor is relatively normal, but the others are somewhat off-center. Taylor's boyfriend Jax, is a rather unsuccessful musician, her mother Alice just left her second husband because he watches too much TV, and the Cherokee clan that is trying to reclaim Turtle is something else!<br />In spite of the fact that the characters are bizarre, the plot was interesting if somewhat contrived; and any mother could relate with Taylor's fear of losing custody of her daughter.<br />I read this book after reading Barbara Kingsolver's most recent novel, Poisonwood Bible, and was somewhat disappointed at the character development in Pigs in Heaven. Of course, they are completely different novels, but I felt she did a much better job of creating believable characters in Poisonwood.	2000-11-28

Of course, the kidnappers order Walter not to involve the police or FBI , or they will kill Emily instantly. Walter, who is in line for the top spot at the bank, seems to care more about his position and his mistress than Emily. And everyone seems to be a suspect in the kidnapping, including Walter, his beautiful young mistress, Angela Hilliard (also a bank executive), the security manager, and other officers at the bank.<br />Although none of the characters are particularly endearing or easy to identify with, the plot held enough intrigue and strange twists to keep me involved until the bizarre but satisfying ending. Of course, it wasn't particularly realistic or plausible, but that's not necessarily what I look for in a mystery. A mindless, entertaining, quick, easy read.	2000-11-23

He loves his job, has bought a new house for Polly and Zoe, and wants to have many more children. But Polly and Zoe don't come home from a trip to DisneyWorld, and Kevin's perfectly planned life falls apart.<br />And there the mystery begins.

Why is his brother Frank (also an alcoholic policeman) being pursued by the Internal Affairs Bureau? Why is his brother Kevin so angry? And how could anyone with such a troubled family possibly be as supportive and loving as his sister Margie? How can someone as emotionally damaged as Kevin recover from all the cruel blows being delivered to him?<br />The pace never slackens in this tense melodrama, and you'll be turning pages until the end.<br />I read &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; also by Denis Hamill and was equally engaged with that book.	2000-11-19

The background chapters in Part 1 on the Digital World, Networks and Internet Business Models are informative but not overwhelmingly technical. The chapters in Part 2 (Online Marketing Themes) are really interesting, in that they point out the many differences between marketing in the real world versus marketing in the virtual world.  Topics such as Personalization, Traffic and Brand Building, Online Community, and E-Commerce are really the &quot;meat&quot; of this book and are informative as well as easy to read with plenty of current examples.<br />The challenges of developing and documenting the &quot;principles&quot; behind the amorphous, nebulous, fast-changing Internet are significant, but Dr. Hanson has certainly succeeded in producing a viable, useful resource. I'm sure he's busily working on an update, and I will look forward to reading anything he has to say about marketing in Internet time.	2000-11-19

But consider the children...he is afraid of disrupting their lives further by starting a custody battle.<br />The previous reviewers seemed to be polarized. They either hated the book or loved the book. I was mesmerized by it, staying up late and reading when I should have been studying for mid-terms. The characters seem to come alive, and the dialogue and the scenes that are painted in your mind and vivid. This should be made into a movie, but considering the level of profanity and crude acts, it might be tough to hang on to an R rating.<br /><br />The plot tension created by not knowing how Colin would resolve the custody situation with Gina kept me turning pages until the end. Nothing was resolved until late in the book, but you knew that something had to happen soon, because there weren't many pages left! The ending was shocking, but appropriate. I couldn't have imagined any other way out for Colin and the children.<br />I will be looking for other works by this author, and hope that each are as spell-binding as &#34;Fork in the Road&#34;.	2000-11-09

I cried, I laughed and I sighed at the grim truths and revelations in Mary Pipher's book on aging and the place held in our society by our elderly citizens. I folded so many page corners over for review that the book looks like a favorite old cook book.  I wish I had read this book before my parents entered old-old age. I was not raised with any grandparents nearby, so had no examples for what to expect and how to deal with and care for aging parents.  Growing old with dignity and dealing with declining health and eventually death is the hardest passage of our lives. None of the other passages as individuals, parents or spouses can compare to these challenges. Adolescence, puberty, child-birth, child-rearing, divorce...all seem like a walk through the park in comparison.<br />Having said that, we all need to read the book before our parents reach the old-old phase (although who knows exactly when that might happen). If you're in your 40's or 50's, chances are you should be reading this book. Although the book doesn't provide any recipes or procedures for dealing with the issues of the aging, it does provide valuable insights and suggestions into attitudes, fears, and concerns of both the aged and their care-givers.<br />We just assumed that mother would ask for help when she needed it, but her pride, reluctance to communicate and fierce need to be independent would not allow her to admit how needy and frail she had become. We finally discovered how badly she had deteriorated (although she still wouldn't admit it), and are still regretting that we didn't intervene sooner. She's now in a convalescent hospital, sometimes stoically accepting her condition, but sometimes angry, depressed and resentful. I'm sure I'll pick up the book and read it again as we find our way through this passage. And then when I become a young-old and finally an old-old, hopefully I'll be able to remember the valuable life lessons I'm acquiring now.	2000-10-03

Now you are shuffled from doctor to doctor as your medical  plans are changed, and no one is responsible for maintaining records about  your health except YOU. This easy to use spiral-bound diary includes  sections for medications, immunizations, weight, blood pressure, doctor's  appointments, symptoms, and diagnoses.
