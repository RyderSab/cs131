What you've read in the other reviews is right, and I wish I was as erudite as Barrett. Let me start by saying I thoroughly recommend the book.<br />Having said that, the juxtaposition of Skinner with Solzhenitsyn as alternative &quot;futures&quot; ignored, I think the rise of fundamentalism as a reaction to modernity that started actually before this book was written (Jerry Falwell was quite active before this book was in print).  We've seen those results in 9/11, now.<br />The balance I think Barrett's pointing to in the mystical versus the pragmatic/rational is good, and his writing can be extrapolated to see why some of these fundamentalisms have taken hold in places.  The extrapolation's necessary, I think.<br />One can also deconstruct this book to good results to approach that extrapolation. The title of the book, &quot;The Illusion of Technique,&quot; rightly points to the futility of technical approaches to bring meaning to life.<br />However, his prescription, practiced ritual enforcing faith, if not informed by a deep doubt, is basically &quot;dead works,&quot; or &quot;bad faith,&quot; something worse.  His nihilist, I think, ultimately has the more moral position than either the believer or the scientific naturalist. Without the nihilist, the practiced ritual of faith is, at the end of the day, yet another technique.<br />Today's Christian and Islamic fundamentalists practice both ritual and mysticism, and the lack of doubt and humility about where their movement is taking us- over the precipice that is- is a horrible future possibility.<br />These are important ideas to on which to ponder; hopefully this book wil be back in print.	2004-06-04

Rather, he takes a roundabout view of things, and ferreting out the main point or theme is difficult amidst all the ancillary material presented.  Gibbon would be a flop as a journalist, or as a corporate communicator today. <br />As a better example of history well-written, try the Pelican History of the World, by J. M.

The fact that Hawaiians got screwed out of most of their country, is ignored, as is the massive genocide of Californian Native Americans.<br />What's most striking to me, though, is the utter lack of vision- McDougall utterly doesn't anticipate the rapid rise of China, (who &quot;always slays itself&quot;) nor the torpor of present day Japan. <br />McDougall's also quite ignorant about how things haven't really changed in Japan (the power centers are still pretty much what they were during the war, only now, they're just not militarisitc.)	2004-03-28

Bennett, whose work reveals so little insight into the man himself.

Or to put it another way, he's not drawing from enough sources.<br />There's a long section on Ms. Blavatsky. There's alot to be said here, but I can't help but get the feeling that the whole Spiritualist movement needs more criticism than he gives it.<br />Another, IMO, glaring deficiency is Field's introjected re-rendering of why Philip Kapleau came to break with Yasutani-roshi.   It CAN'T be purely over &quot;sutras in English or Japanese,&quot; and no doubt is much deeper culturally than merely an attempt to &quot;Westernize&quot; certain forms of services.  What Fields doesn't quite come out and say - probably because he doesn't really know- is that the Chinese versions of sutras &amp; dharanis  are themselves translitterated from Sanskrit! (He does get it straight that the Japanse/Korean ones are translitterated from Chinese). What this all means is basically summed up by what my Chinese wife told me when we saw a video of Chinese monks chanting and I asked what they were chanting: she said &quot;I don't know!&quot;<br />Kapleau must have known this- or should have. <br />More stuff I'd like to know: why Sambokyodan broke from the Soto sect, and more up to date stuff. I will admit as of this time I haven't found out the stuff about Richard Baker.<br />My preference, as an American Buddhist, is to present the history of Buddhism in America warts and all. That might clash with more Eastern notions of Buddhism, but I do think more accuracy is needed in a history.	2003-06-02

Frankly, the idea of philosphical discussion isn't a  bad one, but what this book leaves out- both in the author's personal narrative, as well as the dialogues- speaks volumes for what is wrong with philosphical discourse in this time and locale.<br />First, Philips devotes  not one word to non-Western philosophies, which is amazing considering that the guy has an M.A. in philosphy.  The fact that these philosphies are absent from the discourse means most importantly that the concrete application of one's &quot;love of wisdom&quot; is absent from this book. <br />That means, among other things, that Philips sees his &quot;Socrates&quot; synthesis as somehow superior to those who lead a &quot;mundane&quot; life. Unfortunately for Philips, it's the &quot;mundane&quot; that provide the means for him, directly or indirectly, for him to hold is cafes. (If perhaps Philips had been familiar with Eihei Dogen, he'd have seen the &quot;mundane&quot; in a different light.)<br />The book seems therefore to offer little real insight - despite the claims in the book- into Philips himself.  Yeah, he had a mid-life crisis. Yeah, he thought his life wasn't &quot;exciting&quot; enough. Yeah, he got educated in Western philosphy and started being a &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; disseminating Socratic methods.  But that's no answer to the concrete problems that many in life face- probably including Philips himself.  Ultimately, he's not much to emulate. Philips' Socratic method is limited, it seems, to ideas only- not actions, and that makes this reader feel that the whole enterprise is kind of impotent. <br />Along a similar line, another thing that's absent from this book is any major take on deconstruction and other post-modern trends. One might suspect the former is absent because of the devastating criticism of Plato made by Derrida. Regardless, it's a gaping hole in the book. <br />Still, as I said before, any book that gets ordinary people to think about things- and question their beliefs, is hardly a bad one.  For that alone, I give it 3 stars. Its embedded tutorials on great Western philosphers are quite good too. Still, if I were to introduce anyone to this particular area, I'd still start with Russell's History of Western Philosphy.	2002-05-20

I'm not a Catholic, and I'm not Protestant, but the Catholics always win this argument, because the same ecumenical counicls that created the bible- by editing- are the same ones that created the Catholic Church's structure (as well as the Orthodox Churches.)<br />This is something the Protestant Churches cannot escape. It is something that is denied by fundamentalists- especially Calvinist fundamentalists such as the author for emotional reasons, but they cannot escape the logic. <br />Left unaddressed is the attempt by many Calvinists toattempt to aggrandize sections of their bible  to inflate its authority- to the point of mistranslating &quot;inspired by God&quot; to the nearly meaningless &quot;God-breathed.&quot; Another example, and a particularly stupid one Revelation 22:18-19 is a favorite one, but also perhaps the most silly of &quot;proof texts.&quot; That text says you can't change the bible, and Calvinist fundamentalists will argue that Catholics do so with their Tradition, Magisterium, etc.  However, that verse only applies to Revelation, and, in fact, the bible ITSELF violates that passage (not to mention any translation, copying, discussion of, rendering in any media, etc.)<br />In short &quot;sola scriptura&quot; has far bigger problems than Catholicism- despite its recent travails. But then again, the believer of either of these traditions does so not for any real rational purpose.	2002-05-02

In particluar, the expositions on the Dharma-kaya, on death, and on suffering are very well presented.  The sections comparing Buddhism to Christianity alone are worth the price of the book.<br />That said, however, some of the concepts that are presented, in my opinion, are not rendered well in English. Too often the term \\"monism\\" is used, which has implications that have been seized upon by people that would rather create a caricature of Buddhism. (\\"Non-duality\\"- not two, and not one- is a better rendering). Unfortunately, Suzuki was an early translator, and this is an early translation of Japanese Buddhist ideas. <br />In addition, we see in this book some of the infusion of Japanese martial spirit that was later to tarnish Japanese Buddhism, and to provide Westerners with an important koan- how to reconcile the Dharma of compassion and respect for all beings with the militant nature espoused here.  There is an answer to this koan, to be sure, but you'll only find the question hinted at here. <br />So, I'd recommend the book heartily, but the reader should also read other works to get a fuller picture- e.g., Brian Victoria's book on Zen at War, as well as Nagarjuna, and other writers.	2002-05-01

Isamu Yamamoto's writings of Buddhism are hardly in any way an accurate understanding of what Buddhism is, but rather, a fundamentalist fun-house mirror version of Buddhism.<br />There's many good books that someone can read if they want to know about Buddhism. I'd recommend the following authors: The Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, D.T. Suzuki, and Shunryu Suzuki, for starters. <br />Yamamoto says, for example, that Buddhists \\"more interested in what they can mystically experience than what they can theologically understand,\\" although apparently Yamamoto doesn't realize that Buddhism's great philosophers, such as Nagarjuna, and Dogen were centuries ahead of Western philosophy.<br />It is especially clear that Yamamoto's take on Zen Buddhism reveals a profound ignorance beyond the superficial, transmuted into Christian concpets, which, of course, is a gross misrepresentation of a practice, that, as the great Christian Thomas Merton noted, was to theology in the same way that tennis was to mathematics.<br />Read Merton's Zen and the Birds of Appetite, read Dogen's works, read both Suzukis. <br />But stay away from this tripe if you want to begin to approach an intelligent, respectful conversation with a Buddhist.	2002-04-23

And whoever attempts it even with the best right but without inner constraint proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring to the point of recklessness. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life brings with it in any case, not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes lonely, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing one like that comes to grief, this happens so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize.&quot;<br />And so it is with Dobson.  Dobson is so afraid of a child born independently, that the child may think for himself, that the child may act as a free agent, (and thus, by his very existence show Dobson to be a scam-artist, bully, hypocrite, and fellow traveler of fascists) that Dobson advocates  &quot;controlled violence&quot; (with a wink and a nod to the child abuser).<br />Dobson's goal is diametrically opposed to true, authentic healthy  human development; it must be for Dobson is at his core driven by greed and hatred, judging from writings such as this tome.  However, again as Nietzche points out, all James Dobsons are inevitably doomed to fail. The &quot;good Christians&quot; that result from Dobson's teachings ineveitably are drawn to the seemy section of town, to Dylan's Desolation Row, where there is at least the reaction to the wax-figure Thomas Kinkaide existence that Dobson would cram down the child's throat. Again, quoting Nietzche:<br />&quot;Later, when the young soul, tortured by all kinds of disappointments', finally turns suspiciously against itself, still hot and wild, even in its suspicion and pangs of conscience - how wroth it is with itself now! how it tears itself to pieces, impatiently! how it takes revenge for its long self-delusion, just as ifit had been a deliberate blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself with mistrust against one's own feelings; one tortures one's own enthusiasm with doubts; indeed, one experiences even a good conscience as a danger, as if it were a way of wrapping oneself in veils and the exhaustion of subtler honesty - and above all one takes sides, takes sides on principle, against &quot;youth.&quot; Ten years later one comprehends that all this, too - was still youth.&quot;	2001-06-11

Einwechter and containing chapters by some of the Christian Right's most unstable extremists, Explicitly Christian Politics is nauseating. Attempting to deny what Christ said about his kingdom not being of this world, these devils would substitute Christ's heavenly kingdom for their own dictatorship.<br />The book's premise is straightforward: Jesus Christ is both Creator and King, and therefore all of life, both private and public, is subject to the author's interpretation.  That is, the authors are pretending to be god. The implications of this should be obvious, but alas are not: today 1/2 of the U.S. Senate would sleep soundly at if the reigns of goverment were turned over to Pat Robertson- or, e.g., if John Ashcroft were to become attorney general.<br />Every ideology is inherently hubris, since it inevitably makes assumptions concerning creation and the nature of reality and the source and meaning of right and wrong.<br />Hopefully Americans will learn of the diabolical nature of these Reconstructionist theocrats before it's too late.	2001-01-04

Those folks who've been abused by these &quot;programs&quot; know about their abuse.<br />They know that 12 Step programs have no clinical evidence supporting  safety and efficacy.  They know that this is a huge racket, and supports cultist behavior. They've been there.<br />And how 'bout:<br />&quot;Yes, incidents such as described in this book have happened in AA and                   in a very few treatment facilities.&quot;<br />*Very* few? Where's the statistics? Frankly, what we do know from studies that have been done (see Ken Ragge's excellent book), that long term attendence in 12 Step programs is associated with dysfunctional behavior. We know that groupers often staff these institutions.  Based on that &quot;very few&quot; seems to be the words of someone with an axe to grind!<br />&quot;Treatment                   centers that allow abuses such as described would not stay in business long. They would have been                   closed down by their state certification board.&quot;<br />Nonsense. As is well known, these &quot;treatment&quot; centers tend to staffed by recovery cult members, who tend to exhibit denying behaviors.  As is also well known, individuals have had to make federal cases (including Supreme Court decisions) just to exercise their right to be free from those cultists.  If they are going to be abusive of liberties, why should we take it on the faith of this person that they would only stop at freedom of religion abuses?<br />&quot;This entire book seems to be a                   vehicle to slander an organization that has helped millions gain sobriety.&quot;<br />I've read this book, and I would say that this book is an attempt to tell the truth. The truth is the statement that AA has &quot;helped millions gain sobriety,&quot; has never been shown to be true- it's just a slogan.

But rather consider this book as an exposition, albeit unintentional, of the fundamentalist mindset, at least that of Tim La Haye (and radical theocratic organizations such as CWFA, Focus on the Family, the Christian Coalition).<br />This book has embedded within the &quot;apologetic&quot; arguments of the gangster-god: Irene claims that one shouldn't joke about the &quot;rapture&quot; because one just &quot;doesn't know&quot; what will happen.<br /> The rapture, by the way, is an invention of the last 150 years- orthodox Christianity has never considered a literal &quot;rapture&quot; since Revelation was included in the sriptural canon. Revelation was included in the canon with the understanding of the ecumenical council that it was metaphorical- and did not presage a &quot;tribulation,&quot; or other such hoo-hah. Tim La Haye won't tell you that, because it would hurt him too much in the wallet.<br />I for one think the gangster god who makes us an offer you can't refuse- a.k.a. the Orwellian named so-called &quot;good news&quot; is bunk. So, theology aside - what this book *is* useful for is as an insight into the mind of the followers of this &quot;gangster-god.&quot;<br />And you get plenty of fascinating information. You get, for example, religious bigotry:  Only the &quot;real&quot; Christians are &quot;good&quot; people. And you get the propagation of the myth related to euphoria inducing substances: Rayford Steele is made to feel guilty over the fact that he drinks &quot;hard&quot; liquor occaisonally, though not to excess, and so he hides the offending demon rum away from his young son.  And, you get Evangelical equivocation: for some reason all the kids get raptured. Even the Kip Kinkels, one would imagine. John Calvin would rise out of his grave if he heard of this, and then we'd just have to rebury him.  Finally, you get wacky science and geopolitics: the Israelis invent a &quot;miracle fertilizer&quot; (despite the fact that it's been known for a whilethat Israel's &quot;miracle in the desert&quot; is coming to an end because of over use of the land), and, for no particularly goood reason (since the Russians have part of the famed Black Earth zone)the Russians go to war with Israel to get this &quot;fertilizer.&quot;<br />I bet.<br />Finally, I have to comment on the psychology behind this type of offal. Clearly the authors use God, and his &quot;judgement&quot; as a stand-in to execute their own resentments, vicariously, on the &quot;media,&quot; nonChristians, and anyone else who doesn't think exactly like them.<br />Some &quot;good news.&quot;	2000-10-27

Cheney's husband, Dick, despite all the moral and &quot;absolutely true&quot; advice  he presumably can get from Lynne, still can't figure out that exercising  stock options in excess of $10 million received for the dubious reason of  helping to run a company into the ground.  But I digress. <br />First, Cheney  these folks put themselves up on the soap-box of &quot;evidence&quot; and  &quot;logic,&quot; but, they clearly want the reader to ignore the fact  that linguists and mathematicians have shown logic to be limited at best in  its application to &quot;truth.&quot; <br />Logic, and  signs and symbols, are  *representations* of what we think- they cannot be shown to point to an  existence beyond the *agreed upon representation.*  Aristotle, amplified by  Boole in the 19th century, was dealt a huge blow by Godel in the 20th.  Paradoxes exist because of the nature of the limitation of the symbol and  sign. So, &quot;truth&quot; has at best *limited* expression via sign and  symbol. Or, to put it in the language of the Zen Buddhists over 700 years  ago, &quot;A picture of a rice cake does not satisfy hunger.&quot;<br />This  is the fatal flaw in Cheney's (and every absolutist's) argument. <br />The  other problem, as some reviewers here unintentionally noted, is the  straw-man attack on post-modernism and deconstruction.<br />One reviewer,  echoing Cheney's strawman critique, said, &quot;The central ethic of  post-modernism is that                  truth does not exist. It is not  merely indeterminate. It does not exist, period.&quot;  <br />The problem with  this statement is that it is utterly false.<br />I would direct the reader who  would not like to make a fool of himself if he ever discusses these issues  with people who know what they're talking about to read some of the  &quot;easy-read&quot; books, such as &quot;Derida for Beginners&quot; or  &quot;Foucault for Beginners.&quot;<br />They'll also find that- given their  sincere desire to bear witness to the &quot;truth,&quot; that folks like  Cheney are mere hucksters throwing red-meat to what they perceive to be the  bleachers crowd.	2000-09-14

Geisler is at a loss to resolve paradoxes of this nature.<br />Godel, in  particular, showed - via logic- that any deduction of even such a  &quot;simple&quot; system as Number Theory (the theory that governs the  relationships with whole numbers) cannot be fully derivable from logic  alone- that any such derivation must be either incomplete or, if complete,  inconsistent.<br />What this means is that logic's end result is the  impotence of logic to describe even the &quot;ideals&quot; of number  theory, let alone the rest of the world.	2000-09-13

The interview style presented here occasionally makes one cringe. E.g., David Barsamian's admission that he does NY Times crossword puzzles, and his hope that Zinn doesn't hold it against him come as treacly.  Another  example is Zinn's comparisons of himself with Chomsky.  Although perhaps in  the original radio interviews these sounded funny, they really make Zinn  come across as an alienated armchair Marxist from time to time.  And that's  too bad, because there's a lot of good stuff in this book.<br />It's a good,  quick read, with some nice historical tidbits thrown in.  It's interesting  in presenting facets of Zinn's personal life, but of course, the main  attraction of Zinn is his take on history.<br />I DO think though he's  underestimated the internet- I personally think that here, the rats have  taken over the laboratory, and that's the way it'll be.	2000-07-14

Upon reading this, I realized where this could be true.  This beginners book is very well a good book for the general reader.<br />Yet,  one must know Derrida not only because he is important in his own  'write'--but because so much of literary theory draws from buzz-words and  concepts affiliated with his work. As a busy graduate student, I simply did  not have the time to read all of Drrrida. I can honestly say, that without  having read Derrida for Beginners, I would not have been able to understand  what Derrida I have had time to read--nearly as well.

Evolutionary theory has *evolved* over the past century, with issues such  as punctuated equilibrium, evolution in hot water springs, etc. coming to  the fore.<br />Despite the lingering ignorance of people who line the pockets  of folks like the Institute for Creation Research, creation science is  dead.  Despite the political agenda of Dembski, Behe et al., their  &quot;intelligent design&quot; &quot;theory&quot; is not scientific. <br />One  example of a problem: we know that all our earlier definitions of  &quot;intelligence&quot; presumes some ethnic or cultural vantage point,  and also includes a vantage point of species (although dolphins have been  graceful enough to us to entertain us).  <br />This suggests that  &quot;intelligence&quot; is a term that can give rise to  privilged/marginalized dualities, and indeed, there must be some good  deconstructions of intelligence tests.  Make no mistake about it: we can  tell certain things from a watch, we can tell whether or not a child can  spell &quot;apple.&quot; We can tell when someone is an outlier with  respect to the norms of performance of certain skills requiring  intelligence.  There *has* been correlation between these skills and  specific parts of the brain.  But all these tests are inherently  anthropocentric.  Moreover, all these tests are performed in an ad hoc  rather than post facto situation.  Thus, there will always be the ambiguity  of meaning in a search for origins based on &quot;intelligent  design.&quot;<br />IOW, Behe and Dembski were buried by Derrida when they were  suckling at theirmothers breast.	2000-05-30

In fact, if one did, one would be placing his or her credibility on the line. &quot;<br />Well, speaking as an  information theorist (Ph.D. in statistical communicaton theory, with 8  patents) allow me to put that myth, as well as Dembski's, to  rest.<br />Dembski's theory is hogwash, and I'll try to tell you why in simple  terms. As Intervarsity press noted, in reviewing Dembski's other book on  the subject, &quot;In the movie Contact, an astronomer played by Jodie  Foster discovers a radio signal with a discernable pattern, a sequence  representing prime numbers from 2 to 101. Because the pattern is too  specifically arranged to be mere random space noise, the scientists infer  from this data that an extraterrestrial intelligence has transmitted this  signal on purpose.&quot; Now *why* could the Jodie Foster character's  equipment detect it? Because it was a *recognizable* alternative against  the hypothesis that the received signal was random noise (which is a very  good empirical model- your radio, TV, and internet wouldn't work  otherwise).<br />This brings us to a fundamental point about the theory of  hypothesis testing or the theory of statistical inference. The choices of  decisions we make in an inference or hypothesis test stems from knowledge  *we previously have* about the set of all possible alternatives of  hypotheses. <br />In Foster's character's equipment's case, the alternative  was &quot;noise based on previous measurements&quot; vs. &quot;something  different, that fit a pattern we can measure.&quot;<br />In the case of  inferring &quot;intelligent design&quot; Dembski claims you can eliminate  stochastic (in layman's terms &quot;random&quot;) elements of the process  (via so-called &quot;specified complexity,&quot;) but that's absurd,  especially in the field of evolution. We *know* under certain circumstances  electromagnetic radiation,to take just one example, is mutagenic, and it's  ability to be mutagenic is random. (I haven't got time to go into it here  deeply, but &quot;random&quot; doesn't imply &quot;senseless, purposeless,  yada yada yada.&quot; It implies in fact that an inferrable order is  present! That's why we can predict that a fair coin flipped a large number  times comes up heads with a frequency of about 1/2 the time. Anyone who  doubts me can read some introductory material on Probability Theory, by  say, Kolmogorov.)<br />So to claim there is a hypothesis &quot;Intelligent  Design&quot; or &quot;specified complexity&quot; one has to know in advance  that this degreee of complexity is in fact, due to an &quot;Intelligent  Designer.&quot;  This is particularly difficult in the theory of origins,  where, because of the periods of time involved, and the possibilities for  occurrence all over the earth, rare events DO happen. (It's a fundamental  theory of probability that given a large enough number of chances to  occurr, a rare event will almost certainly occur.)<br />So, in the theory of  origins, &quot;rare events&quot; *can never* be separated from other  stochastic events. Dembski is therefore wrong. Quo Ergo  Demonstratum.<br />Dembski is in effect claiming that he knows which came  first, the chicken or the egg, when *observation alone* cannot answer the  question. And if from observations we can't make an intelligent inference,  that's called *junk science.* Thus, Dembski's claim to be able to detect  &quot;specified complexity&quot; is utter nonsense.<br />Finally it should be  noted that Dembski, though he may be a mathematician (what did he study in  mathematics? Lie algebras?) he also has a political agenda too. Dembski has  been recently seen lurking (perhaps that's too mild) with the  &quot;Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture,&quot;  whose stated goal is to culturally marginalize atheists. <br />One has to  wonder when one sees people trying to resort to junk science to shore up  religious bigotry. You tend to see both junk science and junk religion.	2000-05-25

To include in a book on *parenthood* a diatribe against gays and lesbians illustrates just what kind of &quot;advice&quot; you'll get from this physiology major.<br />One must wonder what motivates someone to include such  a screed in a book ostensibly about parenting.

Since it's obvious that there are moral people who don't believe in God, including atheists, and nontheists such as Buddhists, the answer should be obvious.<br />But Zacharias wants to peddle religious bigotry dressed up in  the snake oil of apologetics.  If atheists are responsible for Joseph  Stalin, then Zacharias has the Crusades, and the blood of those martyred  with the slogan &quot;God will know his own&quot; (the early version of  &quot;Kill 'em all- let God sort 'em out) on his soul.<br />The idea of  attributing Nazism to Nietzche is repulsive, too, and one of the current  &quot;big lies&quot; in favor by religious right revisionists these days.  Nietzche, in fact refused to speak to Wagner over his antisemitism.  Nietzche was a tormented atheists, who clearly understood from a Christian  framework what the &quot;death of God&quot; entailed.  I wonder how come  Zacharias left out all of Hitler's quotes about what a good *Christian* he  was. Actually I don't. False witness isn't false witness with these  hucksters.<br /> If you're a Christian, read Kierkegaard's *Training in  Christianity, *  and don't waste your time on this putrid excresence.	2000-05-06

The reviews of Ragge's book by groupers below are not surprising- they mirror the reviews books that are critical of Scientology.<br />I would be appreciative of perhaps a bit more of a personal narrative in Ragge's book- how he got where he is, but I suspect that's not a pleasant subject for  him.  Regardless, this is an outstanding work that has helped people  already.<br />As far as Ragge's critics here, I have one response, which I  think Ragge's book backs up in a crystal clear fashion. ANY treatment for  ANY condition- including overindulgent alchoholic BEHAVIOR (not a  &quot;disease&quot;) should be SAFE and EFFECTIVE.  That's the same  criteria that any other &quot;treatment&quot; would have to have. Yet, in  the alchoholism business, the folks collecting the money don't seem to care  about this simple fact.<br />Ragge makes abundantly clear a simple fact: that  for a vast number of people AA &quot;therapy&quot; is *iatrogenic*.  That  is, it causes or is highly correlated with the appearance of psychological  problems- including an *increase* in patterns of &quot;addictive  thinking&quot; characteristics.<br />That the reviewers here would go to bash  Ragge- calling him a carpenter complaining about his tools, or that Ragge  is denying that alchoholism is a &quot;spiritual&quot; problem (this is  &quot;faith healing&quot; at its worst! Bring on Benny Hinn!), or that  Ragge is a &quot;robot,&quot; merely illustrates how much in denial the  defenders of AA are. And, in their worldview, of course, they have to be,  or else *they'll die.*<br />Thanks Ken. You've been of great help.	2000-05-03

This is an item that attempts to appeal to the impotence of parents to encourage them to  abuse their children. Plain and simple. Like that cruelty advocate, James Dobson, these demagogues only teach &quot;might makes right.&quot;  The morality  taught be these monsters is basically the enlightened &quot;biblical&quot;  morality that has a linear connection to the evils of slavery and genocide  (both of which are also approved of in the bible).<br />The authors inveigh  against &quot;child centered&quot; parenting.  Guess what? If you have  kids, you damned better WELL realize they are to be paid attention to!   They don't exist to give you glory and honor, that you can pretend to be a  mini-god or mini-despot in your ticky-tacky house in the burb. <br />They are  people in their own right, and probably more worthy of respect than you  are.

Books	1	77	156	N	N	There's STILL not enough "Evidence."	McDowell's updated review is an updated heaping of apologetic mind-candy; a piece of woolly headed fluff that on close inspection shows little new.<br />Anyone can read the Internet Infidel's skewering of McDowell's earlier version of ETDAV. The arguments presented there still stand. It's telling that McDowell has remained silent in the wake of their devastating critique of his earlier version. For this new tome, McDowell pulls out some tired old arguments that \\"answer,\\" amongst other things, skepticism, postmodernism, and \\"mysticism.\\"<br />Of the last 2, I can make a brief comment- McDowell completely misreads postmodernists such as Derrida. His take on postmodernism can be refuted by someone who has spent time in their bathroom reading \\"Derrida for Beginners.\\" I'm not kidding. In short, McDowell complains that \\"decentering\\" merely creates a new center- this is completely wrong, in terms of what postmodernists wrote. Instead they state that centers are *always* \\"in play.\\" McDowell is so obsessed with proof texts that he can not imagine a world in which proof texts are absent.<br />Which brings me to my next point: his critique on mysticism is nothing but an attempt to try to find fault with D.T. Suzuki's writings. However:<br /> 1) It is never established that Zen should be exemplary of the mystical exerperience.  Moreover, he relies entirely on out of print works by D.T. Suzuki, whose writing is perhaps way to academic for what Zen actually is. As the Catholic Monk Thomas Merton noted, Theology is to zen as mathematics is to tennis. Basically then, McDowell is trying to \\"prove\\" that tennis can't be played, by making flawed arguments.<br />2) The whole chapter has the patina of a veiled anti-Catholicism, and anti-Orthodox Christianity, since there is a long and deep mystical tradition in these faiths, and finally,<br />3) By attempting to use Suzuki's writings as an \\"anti-proof text,\\" McDowell completely misses the point of Zen.<br />If you turn any page in this book, I think you'll find misstatements of fact, arguments by authority, and other logical fallacies.  In fact, the entire book reads like one big cut and paste.  Some whole sections in the book are \\"X says...Y remarks...Z concludes that...\\" as if by name dropping somebody's opinion, he's scored a point.<br />One final point: his attempted dismisal of those who decline to worship the biblical god on moral grounds (after all, he does command genocide, theft, and a whole host of nasty things) boils down to: don't question god! <br />Now that is about the worst argument I've ever heard, but McDowell is so wedded to the notion of biblical infallibility that he has to say silly things like this. <br />Sorry, but I'd rather be in hell than to spend eternity with a genocidal deity. At least I could help the other suffering people in hell.	2000-04-05

This path is not for everyone- it is for those who believe that they must have a Calvinistic, dualistic, Christianity inspired method to cope with their addiction.<br />However, many of the premises of this book are simply  hogwash. To wit:<br />1. &quot;One drink, one drunk.&quot;  This has been  proven false numerous times in double blind tests.  The truth is, it's the  heavy drinker's *beliefs* about alchohol's presence and its effects that  counts.<br />2. The &quot;progressive&quot; nature of the &quot;disease.&quot;  For most people, this just ain't so- even for most of those with heavy  drinking problems.<br />3. AA is the &quot;last house on the block.&quot; Not  so- there's numerous ways to &quot;get sober.&quot;<br />There has been much  behavioral research since this book was first published.  While some *may*  benefit from such groups for a short time, the notion that people have a  *disease* which is &quot;arrested&quot; by associating with people who have  drunk too much is not borne out by what data there is.<br />I know I will get  much responses from people claiming the &quot;program&quot;  &quot;helped&quot; them, but for every one of these, there's another person  that said and DID, &quot;I don't want substances to control my life, and I  don't want crazy people to tell me what to do.&quot;	1999-10-17
