I've always enjoyed her, so I assumed I would love her book.  And I did!  There aren't any other baby books out there that talk so candidly about motherhood.  Sometimes you just need to read things that brutally honest.  She really made me laugh and relate to her in this book.<br /><br />I only have one little thing that I couldn't relate to.  The whole time she's talking about herself in this book I just can't see her being hairy, fat, or covered in cellulite.  It might be true, but I had a hard time thinking she could relate to me on that one!	2005-08-29

It had been a while since I read the first two books, but I fell back into the stories of the Women's Murder Club right away.  And this one has a shocker that I just couldn't believe!<br /><br />The first two books followed the same formula...they thought they caught the murderer, but really hadn't and had to do a last minute scramble to get the guy.  This book doesn't follow that same formula.  Devastating things happen and the reader knows all along who the killers are.  Maybe not how it is all linked, but the reader knows who is responsible for the murders.<br /><br />It is very intriguing and seems very real.  I liked this story and was glad to get back into the Women's Murder Club saga.  I'm ready for another one!	2005-08-17

I just finished reading Blood Brother and I'm left feeling a multitude of things.  First of all, the book was a little difficult to get through because Anne wrote it herself.  It would have been nice to have a little cleaner of a book to read.  Sometimes it would ramble and stray a little bit.<br /><br />This story also goes to show that Scott Peterson and his parents were in denial the entire time this ordeal was unfolding.  Anne was too, but then she saw the light and decided not to risk her true family for this false one.<br /><br />I'm not an adopted child, so I had a hard time relating to Anne's relationship with her biological family.  She kept stating that the family that raised her (the Gradys) were awesome and could not be replaced.  However, it seemed like the Petersons (and Lathams) just slipped right into place as a secondary family.  She seemed to attach right on to her role as older to sister to Scott.  She really believed in this guy that she had only known for a few years.  It was almost unbelievable to read.<br /><br />If you are an addict of the case then I would read this book, but just don't expect a best seller-type novel.	2005-07-13

I read this in the first few weeks after my son was born.  I wasn't an overly worried parent, but I was a newcomer to this gig and was willing to get any advice I could.  This book was helpful and worked for us.<br /><br />Tracy Hogg breaks the art of calming your baby and learning how to deciper crys and what the baby wants into groups.  Obviously, not every baby is going to fit into a mold because the world doesn't work that way, but you can take a little from one type and a little from the other and form a technique that works for you as a parent.  Her ideas on setting a routine for baby each time they wake up worked wonderfully for us.  Babies like to know what is next so that they can fall into a pattern, a routine.  She's not trying to teach you how to be a parent, but how to cope in the beginning and not drive yourself and the baby crazy.<br /><br />I've read some other reviews on this page.  It seems that most people are picking on one point from the book and focusing their dislike on that, whether it be her view on nursing, or putting each child into a \\"mold\\" or \\"group\\".  If you read this book with an open mind and open heart to learning how to decipher your baby's cries or needs it can be helpful and a tool to learn about your baby.  Don't use this is a be-all, end-all for parenting, but just a guide to start you off on the right foot.	2005-07-13

I had been a little disappointed with the last few Stephanie Plum novels, so I wasn't sure what to expect with this one.  Guess what?!  She's back!  Janet Evanovich has written a hilarious eleventh book.  It takes me back to the beginning books that had me rolling on the floor and trying to read each page faster and faster just to get to the end of the book.<br /><br />In Eleven on Top Stephanie had decided that she doesn't want to be a bounty hunter anymore because she's tired of her cars getting blown up, her apartment getting broken into, and her life being at risk.  But, come on, this is Stephanie Plum and her life is chaotic!  She gets various jobs that end in failure and juggles the two men in her life.  I don't want to write any more about the plot only because you have to read it for yourself and laugh out loud.<br /><br />There aren't any new characters introduced in the story, but the originals are even funnier in this book.  It is a must read book!  Plum (and Evanovich) are back in true form.	2005-07-08

I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan, but in the past year or so I have been a little disappointed with her books.  I still enjoy reading them, but they haven't had the humor and flair that I've gotten so used to.  BUT, in Full Bloom she is back in full force.  This is one of the funniest, romantic, laugh-out-loud murder mystery books I have read in a long time.<br /><br />It picks up with a new character, Annie Fortenberry, but brings in all of the other characters from the \\"Full\\" series.  Annie runs a bed and breakfast in an old bordello and she rents rooms to a couple of women.  Her husband left her for another woman and she has shut love out of her life.  Until Wes Bridges shows up and wants to rent a room.  But she has to work love in around being a murder suspect, planning a wedding for her friends (Max & Jamie from previous novels), running her bed and breakfast, and chasing down the drunk handyman.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!

We don't have the same taste in books, so I was a little wary at first.  I shouldn't have been!  This is a great story for anyone that likes to read interesting, intriguing stories.<br /><br />Atwood starts you off in the present and introduces you to the four main characters of the story.  Then you are taken back in the past to lean of each characters history.  Then the book comes back to the present.  It is not hard to follow, but the more you learn about each character the more you don't want to put the book down.<br /><br />Very intriguing...and leaves you wondering why these people would make the choices they've made.	2005-06-15

It's so frustrating, yet you know that with each turning page something good is going to happen.  It's a really good story with a great ending.  I recommend this book to anyone needing a good love story with some wit, humor, and a little bit of sports mixed in.	2005-04-27

However, they surprise her!  Her parents tell her that she has a sister from a fling her father had before meeting her mother.  And Suze has a new (and irritating) best friend.  She thinks her sister will be her new best friend, but they couldn't be more different!  Jess is frugal and HATES SHOPPING.  The horror!  Hilarity ensues as you read on.  And definitely read on.

I figured it would be good to have one book that would answer medical questions and another book to lighten my mood if I needed it.  This book definitely tries to be humorous, but some of her negativity isn't funny for women going through their first pregnancy.  It's hard to get used to your body changing and getting \\"fat\\" as she likes to put it.  You want to exercise and be in good shape for labor and delivery.  So, I'm sure that after four kids and seven years she was able to reflect on her experiences and find humor in them.  I didn't find much comfort.<br /><br />The book was written in 1995 and you have to continuously remind yourself of that when you're reading it.  The fashion she recommends is HORRENDOUS!  I don't think I would have worn it back then.  The policies and procedures of hospitals are a little different now...especially concerning circumcision.  So, if you do read this book, do so with an open mind and remember it's 10 years old.  Otherwise, try and find a more current book to laugh with and relate to.	2004-08-09

Almost too informative...because a lot of the information scared me and made me overly anxious when certain things would take place in my pregnancy.  It has a great index and a good format for going back to look up information.  I was fine with the month to month format, but some people like week to week better.  It all depends on your style and how you like to learn information.<br /><br />Even if you don't read every single word in this book, I would recommend taking a glance through it or having it for reference.  It's got some great information and a lot of reading to lay the ground work for the beginning of preganancy.  However, if you don't want to know all of the information EVER learned about pregnancy...then don't read this book.	2004-08-09

It's not what I got, though!  This book isn't the best in the entire series, but it's pretty funny and entertaining.  There isn't a ton of excitement and edge of your seat action like some of the prior books.  There are a lot of laughs with the return of Sally Sweet, Grandma at her best, and of course Lula and Stephanie trying to catch skips.  There is a lot of sexual tension between Stephanie and Ranger and confusion in the relationship with Stepahnie and Joe.  I don't even know who I want her to be with...so I can see how she has a hard time figuring it out!  The end does come a bit fast, but don't they all?

It's the story of Andy, fresh out of college and looking for her first job.  She really wants to be a writer for the New Yorker, but takes a job as an assistant to the editor at Runway, a fashion magazine.  Believing that this will put her on the fast track to her dream job, she gives up her life and sanity to the editor, Miranda Priestly.  Miranda is the devil!  She calls at all hours of the night, has impossible demands, and has taken away any semblance of a normal life for Andy.  The story goes from there and can be funny at times.  My problem with this story is that Andy gives up everything for her supposed future.  She puts work ahead of her friend that is quickly becoming a raging alcoholic and sex addict, she answers the call of duty before her boyfriend of three years, and she doesn't stand up for herself until the end of the book.  It's just not that fun to read about someone allowing themselves to be walked all over.<br />If you don't expect too much then you might enjoy some of the story.	2004-06-27

Two of the other bridesmaids have died mysterious (and accidental) deaths, but Ashley fears that they were murdered and that she might be next.  She asks Bailey to get on the case and do some digging.  Bailey, never one to turn down an opportunity to solve crimes, gets involved and finds herself in the middle of all kinds of various mysteries.<br />It was a page turner and I couldn't put it down!  It's a must read...especially for Kate White fans.  You think you know...but you don't...and then it's so obvious you'll question everything.  Very good!	2004-06-01

I wish that I would have read a review on this book before I wasted the time reading it.  It is the worst book that I've ever read.  The book is made up of three different stories...The Tawny Gold Man, Power and Seduction, and Morning Rose, Evening Savage.<br />The Tawny Gold Man is about Anne Moore and Jud Cammeron.  Jud's father was married to Anne's mom, so they are step brother and sister.  They grew up together from the time she was four and he was thirteen.  Yet, they manage to fall in love and disgrace their family.  After 10 years of Jud being banished from the house he comes back to claim his deceased father's business.  There is resentment between him and the other family members.  He asks Anne to marry him in order to gain control of the company.  She does...because she is a weak woman.  He treats her with utter contempt.  However, at the end of the story it was all just a misunderstanding and they really love each other.<br />Power and Seduction is about Tina Merritt and Dirk Tanger.  Again, it is a brother-figure and younger girl falling in love with each other.  Dirk is the beneficiary to Tina's inheritance and she cannot gain control until she is 25.  She asks for money and he says no, so she hates him.  Yet she really loves him because he was her &quot;first&quot;.  She too marries him in order to gain control of her money.  They also misunderstand each other's love and end up madly in love.<br />Morning Rose, Evening Savage is about Tara Schmitt and Alek Rykovsky.  He is a powerful businessman and she works for a company he deals with.  She hates him, he stalks her and ruins her reputation, so she marries him to eventually get revenge.  Makes tons of sense!  The author describes their kisses and love making in such rough ways that it seems as though he could be hurting or raping her, and then tries to make it romantic.  In one scene, Alek basically rapes his wife and she gets turned on by it and realizes how much she loves him.<br />I kept thinking &quot;What is wrong with these women?&quot; while I was reading this book.  I don't know why I finished the book, but I felt compelled to finish and write a review. Do not waste your time reading this book.  It does not make you feel happy for the characters, they are not easy to relate to, the women are weak, and the men are arrogant.

There isn't any spoken dialogue in the whole book.  However, it worked wonderfully and I couldn't put the book down.<br />The story takes place from the early 1950's to the present time (2001 or 2002).  I was born in the middle of this time period, so it was neat to read about events that have happened in my life time from someone's &quot;personal&quot; point of view in a letter.  It really made you feel as though you were part of the friendship and story.<br />Between Friends is the story of Lesley and Jillian, two friends since they were 7 years old.  It begins with notes passed in class or diary entries.  The story progresses through adolescence, high school, love, marriage, pregnancy, loss and death, illness, and getting older.  It is an awesome story of friendship and real life relationships.  I would recommend everyone read this book, and then call up your friends and tell them how you feel.	2004-05-12

Bridget Jones, Simply Divine, Get Over It, Shopaholic Series...<br />This book caught my attention because it was about women being pregnant, trying to conceive, or ending up pregnant unexpectedly.  It fit in with my life at just the right time.  I was very pleased with the story and will read more Jane Green novels.<br />The book is divided into three different sections...Julia, Maeve, and Sam.  However, they do all tie together in the end.  It is a wonderfully written story and the feelings seem very true to life.  I would recommend this book, especially if you are going through pregnancy or have just had a child and need something to relate to.	2004-05-12

Just so you know that right off the bat!<br />Full Blast continues where the last book left off...with the stories of Jamie Swift and Max Holt.  In the latest installment, the town is going through an uproar.  The brownies are being laced with an aprodisiac, there is a new personals section in the newspaper, a lingerie store opened, and a murderer on the loose.  All of this comes together for a funny story and an exciting one as well.  It's a quick read, but one I'd recommend getting.	2004-04-27

I had high hopes for this new book and it was better than expected.  I laughed out loud and couldn't put the book down.<br />Emma Corrigan is the character in this novel and she has a few secrets from her boyfriend, her family, and her friends.  Don't we all?  On a plane ride home from a disastrous business meeting they hit turbulance and she thinks she's going to die.  She spills all her secrets to the man next to her on the plane.  This man turns out to be the very sexy owner of the company she works for...Emma later finds out.  The story goes from there and is so funny, heart wrenching, and honest.<br />We all have secrets...even little things like weight and hair color...that we don't want to get out.  Emma is totally easy to relate to and Kinsella has a way of making you really feel the character.  I wanted to be there to help Emma out or give her a hug.  I definitely recommend this book.	2004-04-21

Her MO is to not get involved and be the best at her job...trying to follow in her slain father's footsteps.  After an error in judgement that cost her her job, she is moved to a small town.  Once there, she encounters the menacing town bully, the Chief of Police (her boss), and many more characters of Purdyville.  The story goes from there with love stories, a cast of wonderful characters, and mysteries to be solved.<br />If you're looking for a well written book that leads you to a good time...this is one you should read.	2004-04-13

Charlotte Hughes and Janet Evanovich have a lot in common when it comes to their writing styles.  (They do have a few novels out togehter, so that would make sense!)  If you like the Stephanie Plum series, then you would enjoy this book.  Hughes has a good way of making interesting (and a bit quirky) characters and bringing them to life.

It is such a heartwarming frontier town and really makes you feel like you are part of the group.<br />This book picks up right where Jessica's story left off.  At the end of her book, Miss Olivia Darling was saved from the wrecked train and was moving to Springwater to start a boarding house.  It's been about a year, and she hasn't had a boarder...until the mysterious Jack McLaughlin shows up on her doorstep.  He has a past that he's trying to hide, but also wrestling with whether or not he should reveal his secrets.  It goes on from there...<br />I cried when I read this book.  It was touching.

I enjoyed the first book, Springwater, so much that I rushed out and bought this next book in the series.  I was caught up in the town and wanted to learn more about the characters that I had fallen in love with.  Springwater Seasons is a combination of four shorter stories that take you through a time period of five years in Springwater.  Linda Lael Miller keeps you updated on everyone you fall in love with in the town and continually adds new and fun characters.  The women introduced in the four novels are all wonderful and so independent!  Springwater is a great town to be a part of...even if it is only as a reader.	2004-02-19

The main character, Selena, is on the hunt for a job and comes across an ad for a position with the CIA.  On a whim she applies, and after thorough background checks and psychological tests she is hired.  The book jacket goes on to say that she meets a man in the class and things get interesting once Selena and her boyfriend are spying on each other of all people.  It sounded like a good fun read.<br />The story is a very good one and the writing is quick witted and the author has invented a mish mash of characters.  I enjoyed the first half of the book thoroughly and couldn't put it down.  And then at some point, the wit isn't there anymore and the spying that Selena and her boyfriend do on each other is serious...and not funny.  The story left me hanging and didn't allow me closure to Selena and what happened.  I must say that this is how things in life do turn out...but I thought I was reading fiction and wanted an ending.	2004-02-10

It is definitely a romance novel and nothing more.  But, I love romance novels!  It is the story of a widow and her daughter making the trek West to meet her new husband.  Instead she meets the man she loves, but because she's not promised to him she can't have him.  It's a sweet story and ends just how you want.  Not too stressful, but a fun read!	2004-02-01

The plot is interesting (if not a wee bit far fetched) and will keep your attention.  It just doesn't get thrilling and scary and make you anxious like some other books I've read.<br />It is the story of Keely Bennett.  Her first husband committed suicide and her son found him.  While dealing with this tragedy, Mark Weaver swoops in as an old friend of Richard's who has to come to help Keely with the legal aspects of his death.  He falls in love, they get married and have a baby together.  Too good to be true?  Yes!  Mark is found dead...presumable an accident in their pool.  Until a woman scorned, the District Attorney, tries to pin it all on Keely's son.  The story from there is about Keely trying to protect her son...and what they find out about Mark's death.  It unravels at a quick pace and doesn't leave you wondering for too long.<br />It's a good book...but not too &quot;thrilling.&quot;	2004-01-23

I knew that there would be mention of characters from Scarlet Feather, so I was anxious to continue these stories.<br />There are a lot of characters in the novel and a lot of story that takes place, so it would be rather confusing to try and explain the plot.

It is a long book, but definitely worth the time it takes to read it.  I only put the book down when I ABSOLUTELY had to.  Maeve Binchy has a wonderful way of weaving you into the character's lives, and that's what makes the book so wonderful.<br />Tom Feather and Cathy Scarlet are old friends from catering school.  They have decided that they want to start a catering business with their own flair and personal touches.  The book takes you over one year...from their finding the premises to their one year anniversary as a company.  All of the character's lives are intertwined somehow and you just want to know more and more about them.  They all have their own little quirks...some good and some just awful.  It will make you laugh, cry, and probably scream at the injustice, but it really is a great read.  This book just really makes you root for the underdog.	2003-12-16

Eileen Goudge does a wonderful job of drawing you into the town and the characters lives.  In the first two books you learn about Anna Vincenzi and her sister, movie star Monica Vincent.  The auther elludes to a strain in their relationship and that Monica is a difficult person, but you don't learn how difficult until this third book in the series.<br />Anna works for her sister full time and also cares for their mother full time.  She's stressed out, overweight, and very unhappy.  This book leads you through Anna's story.  Unfortunately, Monica is found dead and Anna has been arrested for her murder, so life for Anna isn't a wish come true!  The story flip flops between the present and the past.  It leads you through Anna's weight loss, discovery of love, and a self discovery that she can be a strong person.  It's such a great character novel.  I didn't want it to end.  I recommend this book...and the entire series!	2003-11-13

Raised by her mother and not acknowledged by her father, she was constantly searching for approval from her father.  She followed in his career path and strived to be as good as him in the field of psychology.  It isn't until he passes away and leaves her his townhouse that she really learns about what made him tick and why he chose not to acknowledge her as his daughter.<br />Casey finds a journal about a young girl named Jenny.  Her mother was killed and her father is in prison.  Jenny is an outcast and terrified of her father coming home...until she meets Pete.  He is everything she ever wanted in a man and makes her feel loved.  He is perfect!  But is he too good to be true?<br />Casey can't help but want to know more about Jenny and find this girl.  It seems as though her father left her a mystery to solve.  This book is the discovery of two girls and their father-daughter relationships..what they need from these men and what they don't.

In this story, Hazel Marie and Little Lloyd have moved in with Miss Julia, and they have formed quite the family unit...much to the chagrin of the community and the church.  The story has much of the same hijinks as the first one...Pastor Ledbetter trying to get Miss Julia's money for the building fund, Brother Vern trying to get hold of Lloyd and his inheritance, and gossip, gossip, gossip.<br />This story sends Miss Julia off on a search for Hazel Marie when she's been kidnapped by the crooked church fund raiser hired to make more money for the building fund.  She hires a private investigator and demands to be part of the search.  Mr. Pickens, the PI, can't stand to have her and Little Lloyd with him, but of course it makes for hilarious situations...one after the other.<br />Ann Ross has a way with words, and she's just as sharp with her tongue in this book.

His mistress shows up on the doorstep and drops off her ten year old son and says she'll be back soon from beauty college.  That starts off a whole undoing for Miss Julia and her once simple life.<br />To add to the comedy, Miss Julia is very serious, uptight,and naive...but Ann Ross just throws in comic twists and hilarious characters to make you laugh.

I have to agree with another reviewer...I was really disappointed with Visions of Sugar Plums, so I hope there's better stuff to come.<br />The story has the same Plum humor and the same great characters, but focuses a more on the love triangle of Ranger, Morelli, and Stephanie.  I don't know who to root for!  A search for a runaway bond takes Stepahnie, Lula, and Connie to Las Vegas.  So different being out of Trenton!  Lula is hilarious in this story and you learn more about Connie, but there wasn't enough of Grandma Mazur for me.  That lady cracks me up.<br />This book was a tiny bit predictable.  Normally there's a twist or something that makes your mind wander, but this one focuses on the the &quot;killer&quot; too much and you can figure it out.  That's the only bad thing about the story.  Otherwise, it's good 'ole Plum.  Definitely read it!	2003-07-30

I loved Bad Girl Creek and thought it was the best &quot;chick&quot; book of the year.  I was really hoping that Along Came Mary would pick up right where that one left off...and it did, but not in the way that I expected.<br />This story focuses mainly on a new character, Mary Madigan, and Rick Heinrich.  He was in mentioned in the first book, and is Nance's ex-boyfriend.  The story follows them and has chapters in between that focus on the original Bad Girls.  The story entertwines them all together at some point, but you learn the most about Maddy and Rick in this book.<br />It was a good read, but I wanted MORE about my Bad Girls.  This one had a little more darkness to it and sadness.  It was definitely good, but not as good as the original.	2003-07-14

The story goes from there...love, trust, murder, and thrills.  It's a good, quick read.  Especially if you're looking for a light-hearted mystery romance!	2003-07-14

This was our book club selection for the month, so it wasn't a book that I would have normally picked up but am glad that I had the chance to read it.  The story centers around six Latina girls that met while attending Boston college.  They all (mostly) live in the Boston area still and stay in touch, but make sure that they attend their &quot;sucia&quot; nights twice a year to REALLY catch up on each other's lives.  It is very much a character story and those are the kinds of books that I enjoy most.  Each chapter is from the perspective of a different girl, but carries on the stories of all of them within.  It can get confusing, but you learn the characters quickly in the book.  I'm not sure if I was supposed to learn anything culturally from the book, but I did enjoy the story of the six friends.  I would recommend this book as a good summer read.	2003-06-29

We were all intrigued by the excerpt and it was a unanimous decision.  There's the topic of love, deceit, murder, and selfishness.  It is a story that will capture your attention and you'll feel for these characters.<br />Euthanasia is not something that I've ever thought of before, in relation to my life.  In this story, Jamie MacDonald confesses to killing his wife because she asked him to end her life and battle with cancer.  The theory is that he loves her so much that he would do anything she asked of him.  That really makes you question what you would do if put in the same situation.<br />Cameron and Allie MacDonald are married and lead a satisfying life.  Cam is the police chief of the town and Allie is his doting wife.  When Jamie comes to town it puts a barrier between the two of them.  Allie loves Cam so much, and can understand where Jamie is coming from.  Cam doesn't see it that way and views his cousin as a murderer.  But Cam doesn't have a problem being a liar!  Through all of this he cheats on his wife and deceives her...supposedly in the name of love.<br />This story really makes you question what you would do for love and how far you would go.  I recommend this story, especially to book club groups.  I can see it leading to a bunch of discussion.	2003-05-20

I can relate to the characters and understand what they are going through in the book.  In this story, Rose and Maggie Feller are complete opposites.  Rose is a lawyer, very organized and responsible, not too stylish, and a little overweight.  Maggie is a beautiful sexpot, not responsible at all,  can't hold a job, and doesn't like her sister for all the things she is.  They do, however, wear the same size shoes and it is the one thing that Rose has style in.  She buys expensive shoes and Maggie steals them.  This is a great story about the bond between two sisters.  The characters are real and relatable.  Neither one is perfect, they have issues with family, and they try but can't get along.  It's very real and I enjoy the way the Jennifer Weiner writes.  It's a must read!	2003-05-07

This story leads you through a murder mystery with all kinds of crazy characters and circumstances.  You find yourself rooting for Mick Stranahan...a good guy on the search for a killer, but also a killer himself.  Make sense?  Not really...but the book takes you on another wild Hiassen ride.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a very entertaining story.	2003-05-07

I clicked on the title just to see what it was about and felt that I just had to buy the book.  I am in a book club, so I picked this book because I thought that it would spark a ton of discussion.<br />While reading this book I felt so many emotions.  I was very saddened that Jodee had to go through the emotional, verbal, and physical abuse from her classmates.  I was angry at those children and all the parents that told her it would be okay or something that they would grow out of.  I felt sorrow that she had a physical deformity that she was teased about.  I understood all too well what it felt like to look \\"different\\" from the others.  I also felt guilty for anyone I might have teased or taunted in school.  I was very insecure in school and probably used that as a way to make myself feel better.  After reading the book I just wanted to call everyone that I could have possibly said something uncool to and apologize.  I had so many emotions while reading this book, but the best was the happiness and relief that I felt for Jodee at the end of the book.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone.  People need to know and understand the effects of bullying and teasing.  It's not funny...it's just cruel.  I wish that I could take every child that has been teased and just wrap them in my arms and tell them how wonderful they are.  I'm glad that Jodee made friendships along the way and had wonderful parents to tell her they loved her.  This is a must read!	2003-04-03

If you read Full House this brings back Max and Deedee, but 20 years later.  Frankie, Deedee's husband, is running for mayor and begins a search of missing tax dollars.  His brother-in-law, the infamous Max Holt, comes to town to help him out.  Of course Max meets Jamie Swift and is instantly attracted.  The story goes from there and it is a fun read...but no steamy sex like they claim on the back cover!<br />I couldn't put the book down and had to find out who was responsible for the attempted murders and missing tax dollars.  Evanovich scores again with this murder mystery hijinx story.  You can always count on her stories to be fun and entertaining and this one is.	2003-03-26

I think that Sophie Kinsella hit big with the Shopaholic series, and Shopaholic Ties the Knot is another hit.  Becky Blomwood is back and is getting herself in trouble again.  This time it's not that she shops too much...which she still does...but she has two different weddings being planned for the same day!  Only Becky could get herself into...and out of...this situation.  Hilarious antics ensue and she comes out on top...again!  This is a great read and you will fall in love with our shopper.  If you haven't read Confessions of a Shopaholic or Shopaholic Takes Manhattan read those first and finish it up with this one.<br />I can't wait for her next series.  I hope that Becky will be back to have a baby.  Or maybe we can go on the honeymoon with them and see what she puts in the empty trunks she's taken along.	2003-03-19

Yes...it's a lot of fluff.  And yes...it is SO very fun to read!  How could you not fall in love with the Chandler family and want to be part of it?  Carly Phillips does a wonderful job of creating characters.  I loved the little sister Hannah...with her anger and smart mouth.  Just like me!  I enjoyed reading about the brothers interacting and getting manipulated by their mother.  If you liked the Bachelor then you will love this one too.	2003-03-05

It was hilarious and left me hanging, so I just HAD to read this one.  It was good, but definitely shorter and left you hanging for the third book.  If you read the first one, though, you have to read the next two.<br />You just have to root for V in these books and hope that she comes out on top.  She's easy to root for...she's every woman...she makes mistakes, she has her ups and her downs, and she deals with weight issues and feeling loved.  I related to her so much, and that's why I loved the series.	2003-02-24

The third book in this series is a good book and helps to tie up all the loose ends of the first two.  It is a shorter book, just like the second one, and very easy to get through.  You'll want to read straight through to find out how it all ends.  V's husband is such a jerk, and you just want to root against him through the whole book. I would recommend this entire series of books.	2003-02-24

Her feelings and reactions to her husband, her love of men finding her attractive, her &quot;crushes&quot;, and her friendships with the women of the story rang so true for me.  I just really related to the main character of this book.<br />If you want to read the hilarious tale of a woman going through an affair, a cheating husband, raising a young son, and getting fat on top of that then this is the book for you.  You can relate to V and watch her come out victorious and overcome the hurdles in her life.  It will make you feel her pain and cheer for her when she succeeds.  Great read!	2003-02-24

It had me hooked from the beginning, though I must admit the murders were pretty gruesome.  I could not put the book down.  I followed the story of Lindsey Boxer and her three friends that form the Murder Club as they try to solve the Bride-Groom murders.  This story will keep you on your toes and when you think the story has ended it hasn't!  Patterson keeps you going until the bitter end.  Great read!	2002-12-31

The plot is still very exciting and the story grabs you.  I made the mistake of reading one right after the other and it became too predictable to how the story was going to end.  I would highly recommend this book, but not right after you've read the first one.<br />In this novel you follow the Women's Murder Club again, but this time it is a serial sniper that is taking people out.  There is a \\"women's\\" story intertwined, though not love this time, but there's a pregnancy and Lindsay is reunited with her dad.  Patterson does a good job casting suspicion on certain characters to sidetrack you.  The end will surprise the reader, but only as to who the killer actually is.  You think you've caught him, but have you really?  Same formula as the first one...	2002-12-31

Carson Springs is a place that I would want to live.  In this second installment, the story focuses on Gerry Fitzgerald and her family.  It is a wonderful story of a mother meeting her daughter that was given up for adoption, the struggle to help her children understand, and of a woman wrestling with the idea of falling in love again.  The characters from the first book are all present.  The story picks up right where Stranger in Paradise left off.  I can't wait for the third book.	2002-12-14

A sort-of superhero guy that shows up in her apartment at Christmas time?!  The characters were all there and in true form.  However, the book was only 150 pages.  I felt a little ripped-off when I realized that it was so short.  But I was very happy to be able to purchase a book in between 8 and 9.  It makes the wait seem a little less.  So, if you're looking for some Stepanie Plum fun while you wait for the next book...pick it up and enjoy the short story.	2002-12-14

It was our September selection for my book club, and something that I've had on my &quot;Wish List&quot; for quite a while now.<br />I related to the main character, Cannie Shapiro, on so many levels that it almost felt like I was reading a story of my own life.  She is dealing with confusion over a relationship, abandonment issues brought on by her father, and body image and weight issues.  I have been there...and continue to be there.  Jennifer Weiner's use of humor throughout the book helped the reader to see Cannie as a fun-loving girl...even though she struggled with her weight.  She was not depicted as a girl who felt sorry for herself in any way.<br />For anyone who has dieted...or tried to diet...this book will make you laugh.  It's so much more than a comical story about dieting and being fat, though.  There is a wonderful story and Cannie is such a lovable character.  I would recommend this book to anyone!	2002-09-20

I can only hope that I am half as good a friend to my friends as these women are to each other.  The author does a wonderful job drawing you into each of the characters, giving you plenty of background information and descriptions that allow you to picture the characters.  I absolutely loved this story and can't wait for the next book.<br />Oh, and the description of the UPS man just made me laugh.

One of the things I love about these books are that Stephanie is not perfect, quite average looking, and not so talented.  I can totally relate to this character!  The other characters just add to the spice of her life.  Janet Evanovich just develops each character more and more as the series continues and brings back the funniest and oddest people.  I LOVE THESE BOOKS!<br />In this book, the hijinks of Stephanie Plum continues as she is tracking down Eddie DeChooch.  The names are so great!  She gets herself in all kinds of trouble trying to follow an old guy.  There's the tension between her and Ranger and the issues with her and Morelli.  It's another great addition to the series.  Oh, and did I mention that I LOVE THESE BOOKS?	2002-08-15

I was not disappointed in the least, but if you're looking for the greatness of the first book you won't find it here.  Bridget continues her neurotic behavior of counting calories, cigarettes, phone calls, and alcoholic drinks (which is the funniest thing EVER) and she tries to carry on a relationship with Mark.

White Oleander was a heartbreaking story of a girl trying to survive in a world that doesn't give a damn about her.  The people that do seem to care take advantage of her and turn her into the hard, seemingly uncaring person she is in the end.  I kept looking for a sliver of hope for this girl.  She was a very strong personality and did what she wanted...whether it was right or wrong.  Her relationships were dysfunctional and she was just trying to find the love and acceptance she didn't receive from her parents.  In the end she is still fighting demons, but chooses to stand strong and do what is right for her.	2002-08-15

I picked this book up at a bargain price thinking it might be an interesting read and I'd get around to it when I had nothing else to read.  I'm glad that I finally picked it up!  It was such an intriguing tale of sex, lust, love, and maybe even crime.  I could feel Julia's pain as she struggled to find the truth in her seemingly loveless marriage and her confusion of feelings with her best friend.<br />I found the book to be very erotic, until the story got embroiled in a possible crime.  It was a very strange feeling going from erotic to disgusting and/or criminal.  Total paradox.  I enjoyed the book and the plot was one that I had not previously encountered.  I definitely found this book intriguing and was glad that I finally picked it up to read!	2002-07-31

In this story, you are following a newspaper reporter and a woman down on her luck as they try to get back the lottery ticket she had stolen from her by two losers!  The things that happen to these people are so hilarious and things you wouldn't even think could happen to people.

I was disappointed with this one because it came out in the middle of the series and gave away stuff that happened in the latter part of the series.  I know that it's not a movie, where the ending matters, but I was bummed to learn the Keri and Kyle ended up leaving on bad terms.  After watching the show it made more sense to me, but while reading the book I learned that they weren't talking and didn't know if they could ever be friends again.  I was bummed to get information from the book that I hadn't yet seen on the show.  It seems like some of the earlier Real World books tell more secrets and off-camera stuff.

The twist at the end of the book turns everything you have just read upside down and makes you question the entire book.<br />I enjoyed reading the book in reverse chronological order, though I did find it a bit confusing in the beginning.  A lot of references are being made that you can't put together until the second and third sections of the book.

It was easy, but one of the most dysfunctional books I have ever read.  Maybe because I don't snort cocaine, drink obsessively, or whore around I didn't really feel the book.<br />The first and fourth stories were easier to read and laugh at some of the character's actions.  The second and third stories were full of pain and hate...something I don't find fun to read about.  The characters in these two stories brought out physical feelings of disgust.<br />Not a light, easy summer read.	2001-08-22

The main character is Nora Bridge, a host for an advice radio talk show, living in Seattle.  It sounded too much like a cross between Frasier and Dr. Laura.  But, I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised.  The story of a mother and her estranged daughters unfold to display a tale of love, heartbreak, and finding each other again.  It's probably a bit predictable, but heartwarming and an easy read.  I enjoyed the way the story played out...even with the tradgedies that do occur.
