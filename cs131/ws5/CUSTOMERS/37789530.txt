I was so glad I took it home because it was a very good story. The story is told from the point of view of Jereth, a former priest. He runs into Hwyn, a mishapen woman and Trenara, a beautiful woman. They all end up on a quest together to take the Eye of Night where it wants to go, and come across many adventures on the way. There is a little mystery to the story that kept it even more intriguing. Their homeland is interesting and I was amused with the map at the beginning of the book that showed all the directions, North, South, East, and West in the wrong places. They were travelling what would be considered South to us, but they called it North. <br />I can't handle many fantasy books, but this one is very readable. I highly recommend it!	2005-09-18

I feel this one is one of his best (second only to This Perfect Day, my all time favorite book) <br /> <br />The Stepford Wives is short and incredibly easy to read, with such an original chilling idea that has become a cult classic, had two movies made out of it (the first one is pretty close to the original story, the second one is pretty far off but worth watching because it is funny).  <br /> <br />The book starts off intriguing right at the beginning. The Eberhart family has just moved to Stepford and Joanna Eberhart, a budding photographer, wife and mother, is looking to meet new friends. She is suprised to find that many of the women she meets are dull and all they want to do all day is cook and clean. Suspense builds well in this story as clues show up to why women are so odd in Stepford, and what is really going on at the men's association, a big mansion with a club for men only. Things really get chilling when Joanna's friend Bobbie who is a normal, messy woman with a personality goes away on a weekend with her husband and returns as a woman who loves cleaning all day. I won't say more but do read the book!	2005-06-08

I had no idea if I would like it and I do not read Science Fiction regularily even though I love Star Trek. I am so glad I bought it though and I plan to get more of Jeffery Carver's Star Rigger books. <br /> <br />To me, reading this book was an experience like playing an old role playing game called Traveller, meaning it was a fun and exciting adventure in future time in outer space. The book starts out with a rigger (starship pilot) named Renwald Legroeder who is being framed for a crime he did not commit, which involves a mysterious starship that has been missing for 100 years, and space pirates. Legroeder is a human being and there are many humans living on a far away planet named Faber Erdrani (Sp?). There are native people there too and a neat race called the Narseil that the reader gets to know well in the story. Legroeder finds himself in jail waiting for a trial and then suddenly gets released by a lawyer named Harriet Mahoney that wants to help him. From there on the story is an exciting adventure and mystery   with Legroeder needing to find out more about the missing starship Impris to clear his name. This book is very readable, I highly recommend it! I found myself sad when I was done reading, because it was so good and I loved the characters. <br /> <br />	2005-06-08

The book was easy to read and exciting, yet when I  was all through with it I was left with a feeling that it was a little too sugar coated to be accurate. As time went by I started realizing that several things she said did not make sense. Of the top of my head, she said when you pass on all the pets you ever had in past lives would be waiting to greet you. This makes no sense at all to me, for I am sure the pets, if they reincarnate would be busy living a new life or what about all the other masters they had before? Also Sylvia Browne says that people will practice their same religion on the other side, in churches, temples, what have you. And they will all get along peacefully. This also makes no sense. Why go to church when you are already in heaven? And let's say this really happens. I would think if people respected other people's religions on the other side, when they incarnated back to Earth, they would carry on their tolerance. For the most part, I do not see people tolerating other's religions! <br /> <br />I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting to know that there really is a peaceful existance on the other side. I just don't think this book really has an acurate answer. Read it and decide for yourself. I do recommend however, \\"Between Death and Life\\", by Delores Cannon. It also goes with the theme that we reincarnate and rest between lives, and I think her account is much more plausible.	2004-08-18

It starts out with a timid boy named Bastian stealing a book from a bookstore and hiding away in the school attic to read it- \\"The Neverending Story\\". He is swept away into an enchanting world called Fantastica (Yes, it was Fantasia in the movie) following Atreyu to try save Fantastica from The Nothing. Bastian soon finds out this mysterious book includes him in the story! If you are familiar with the movie, this book starts out like it, but has so much more detail included, and the story goes on much longer where the movie ended. In the book, Bastian does not go back home to make wishes in his own world, instead he stays in Fantastica and makes wishes there. I could not get over how original each little idea the author had to include in the story. This book is a good fantasy for children and adults alike.	2003-04-13

It was my favorite to read to my son at bedtime when he was younger. Margaret Wise Brown tells us in her book of the great green room (where a little rabbit is going to bed), describing first many of the delightful things around the room, and then we hear the little rabbit saying goodnight to the room, the moon, the cow jumping over the moon, and the other things that are in the room. I really like the part where there is a blank page and it says \\"goodnight nobody\\" and the next page is \\"goodnight mush\\".  If you have a small child, this book is a must for bedtime reading! I was reading this book to my son when he was an infant, so it is never too soon to start. As a toddler, he never tired of hearing \\"Goodnight Moon\\" each night.	2003-02-23

A sweet tale of a mother's love and a bunny's imagination. When the bunny imagines he becomes a fish to swim away from her, she imagines she will become a fisherman and fish for him. Each idea the bunny comes up with, the mother knows what to become to make sure she gets her bunny back! The story has both black and white illustrations (where the bunnies are talking) and then a 2 page color illustration with each instance of mother getting her bunny in their imagination, such as a delightful picture of Mother bunny in a river with fishing boots; holding a line with a carrot on it to catch little bunny. <BR>This is a wonderful, loving book to read to your child(ren).	2003-02-23

By following Lee's advice, which included her shading tecnique - it's easy, and makes your drawings look really good, and using circle stencils for the eyes so they look natural, I was able with some practice to draw some realistic looking faces and be told I am a good artist (and truly - I needed help!) Lee goes step by step with each part of the face, then teaches you how to draw an entire face with important facts to remember (like there is one eye width between the eyes). She included some drawings done by her students, and a couple of fun exersizes with scrambled bar graphs where you have to draw in each square how you see it in the right spot to see what the mystery picture is.

He did a good job of fooling me! I won't say too much, don't want to ruin the story for you, but here is a short synopsis of the story - Oliver Russell proposed to Leslie Stewart and backed out of it at the last minute, suddenly marrying someone else. Leslie wants revenge, and Oliver's new father in law wants him to be President of the United States. He gets there with his help. He needs to be careful, he has descreet personal life on the side...hopefully no one will find out. Leslie plots revenge - and ends up buying the Washington Tribune newspaper, where the headlines can say whatever she wants. Things really get interesting when a teen girl dies in a suite of a hotel, and no one is sure who she was with.<BR> Sheldon has a knack of keeping you reading - try him out with this book.	2003-02-04

I actually had it on my bookshelf for awhile and didn't read it  right away because the begining was rather slow for me compared to his other books, but I thought, this is Robin Cook, so it has to be good. Was it ever! As soon as the characters were stranded in a dark, muddy cave somewhere under the sea that they determine is not geologically possible, I was hooked. They walk for awhile in knee deep mud and and a big steel door out of nowhere opens up with a light inside. They cautiously go in and from then on I went along with them experiencing the adventure of a lifetime! I won't spoil the fun by telling you anymore right now about the plot. I thought this was a very imaginative work by Robin Cook that possibly became my new favorite of his. (I am still real fond of the Jack Stapleton books, esp. Chromosome 6 and Vector). I really recommend this book, it is way cool!	2002-12-11

I found a wealth of information on where to camp and hike in my neighboring state, and even though I haven't had time to go camping yet, I have used this to find hiking trails to explore. Many nice, enticing photos throughout the book, and decriptions of the wildlife and scenery at the campgrounds and hikes, all nessesary information about the campgrounds and hikes are given, such as how many tent sites are available (I was surprised to see one campground had only one tent site!) and how long the hiking trails are.

I learned so much about birds, other animals and even insects. Reading this book is the first time I really read about Alex the famous African Grey parrot, who is capable of so many things we consider human, such as counting, identifiying colors, shapes, textures, and can request what he wants with sentence as a human can. Not only African Greys are intellegent, this book discusses and gives amazing stories about so many types of birds, from pet budgies to wild birds.  I learned facts about avian navigation and body language and their songs. Many facts were brought up about wild birds (and pets) that seemed so human I was amazed. I felt I was really getting an intimate look at the world of birds as I read this book. The author also included a chapter called &quot;Are all animals intellegent?&quot;. I was very excited to read this as I learned things about gorillas, chimpanzees, dolphins, whales, and even fish, ants and honeybees that amazed me. There is a very nice set of color photographs in the middle of the book, the first one of a rosella grooming a cockatiel being my favorite. If you love animals or have a curiosity about the intellegence of animals, I highly recommend this book!	2002-10-25

Each hike is listed with a general description, the distance of the trail, how much traffic of people to expect there, the best season to go, the elevation gain and maximum elevation. A map is shown and directions to the hike are given along with detailed description of the hike. Many black and white photographs show views from the various hikes. My one disappointment with this book is that the Deschutes River trail that is branched off directly from the Columbia River Gorge is not mentioned in this book, because it is east of The Dalles; this book only mentions the trails from Portland to The Dalles.	2002-10-25

His life becomes bearable though in his end years thanks to the kindness of Dr. Fredrick Treves and many other people. If you haven't heard of or read about the Elephant man yet, I recommend this book, Joseph Merrick's story (the Elephant man) is something you won't forget. The terrors he went through and then how incredibly grateful he was for the simplest pleasures after being rescued by Dr. Treves make me see life through new eyes: it is hard to take things for granted.

As one story points out - &quot;If we could only see it, we are at the mercy of absolutely nothing except our own wrong thinking.&quot; Vernon Howard's teachings are mainly about how we are not our thoughts, we are something beyond that and we can experience this through study and practice. As far as this book goes it gives many new ways to look at things and experience life.

I was deeply affected the first time I read it and am every time I reread it - I will be rereading it for the rest of my life. This book takes place in a futuristic society that I found compelling - \\"fight\\" and \\"hate\\" are bad words, because the whole earth is at peace - no wars, no hunger, no big decisions, no illness, no pollution, no lonliness... everyone is your friend, sounds ideal, I wouldn't mind living like that for awhile!   The story reads so easily. I loved reading all about the world the main character, Chip, lives in. Everyone's career is chosen for him by the computer running the world, Unicomp (Uni for short). Everyone must report to an advisor on a regular basis, who makes sure everything is alright. Everyone has a \\"nameber\\", a name with a number. Chip's is Li with a bunch of numbers. There are only 4 male names, Li, Jesus, Karl and Bob. Only 4 names for females too - Anna, Peace, Mary and Yin. Everyone wears a bracelet with their nameber and must scan at scanners wherever they go. Everyone must report for chemical treatments once a month.  Chip's world is far from perfect, though. It is \\"sick\\" to like one member (everyone is a member of The Family) more than another, to think about what work you would like to do, to draw pictures of people without bracelets, and doing such things and more will cause a member to be tracked down and recieve a stronger treatment.   Chip becomes aware that his world isn't that perfect and that he has lost a lot of freedom. The plot thickens as he recieves secret notes from other \\"sick\\" members who invite him to meet him secretly in the night.   I won't say more except the story and characters are very gripping, all the way to the end... do yourself a favor and read this book, it is a masterpiece.   One final note, why isn't this book in print? And I would love to see a movie!	2002-09-01

It becomes clear early in the book that this guy is highly disturbed, and Dean Koontz really put some effort in to show you in great detail the passages of Junior's mind. It was quite awful, I mean just for one instance he was into hideous art, such as paintings of cancer growing. That is a mild example of his character, actually. He was a murderer many times over and still had this idea that all women wanted him, and also that he was a man of great character!  I waded through all of the stuff with Junior with grimaces on my face only because I wanted to see the outcome of the other plot, about a little boy named Bartholomew. He lost his eyes at a young age, but had a very unusual, special talent. This kept my interest. I wish the book had been more about him, but it was more about Junior.

I think seeds are the natural diet for cockatiels, not man made pellets!	2002-08-01
