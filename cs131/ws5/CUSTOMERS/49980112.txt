What matters is how I choose to react and what I choose to believe about myself.\\"<br />She actually provides many thought provoking affirmations that are uplifting instead of all self-esteem based. Her wonderful affirmation cards for forgiveness actually are more about self-esteem. Some of my favorite affirmations are:<br />\\"I have the self-esteem, power, and confidence to move forward in life with ease.\\"<br />\\"My consciousness is filled with healthy, positive, loving thoughts that reflect themselves in my experience.\\"<br />\\"For every problem that I may create, I am confident that I can find a solution.\\"<br />\\"Life supports me in every possible way.\\"<br />\\"Today, no person, place or thing can irritate or annoy me.

As an overview it's worth reading but if you are looking for a lot of details this book doesn't have them. This book did have some helpful forms &amp; checklists to use when calling homeowners in foreclosure.<br />In Northern California all the foreclosure information is available from the title company including a copy of the original mortgage for the homeowners, property details, liens &amp; recent comparable sales. Any real estate agent can get this information for free from the title company.<br />I wish this book had covered more details on the auction process as well as how to deal with the lenders for properties in foreclosure. He only briefly mentions the &quot;due on sale&quot; clause that some lenders have in their loan contracts and this is a big aspect of taking over the property from someone. The book is worth reading for a good overview of what's involved but further reading is needed to learn the step by step process.	2002-09-19

There were some creative ideas for both vegetarian &amp; meat eaters like &quot;molded ham sushi&quot; &amp; &quot;Sushi wrapped with pickled vegetable leaf.&quot; Additional soup &amp; salad recipes to eat with your sushi were helpful.

Jamie and Sheikh Ben Rassad have some cultural differences to overcome but are deeply attracted to each other from the start. The challenges he has protecting her are made more difficult when she decides to be difficult. Both are strong characters who must learn to adjust to each other as they fall in love. He is the one who realizes he is falling in love with her first while she thinks it's more physical. It's a good story filled with intrigue and passion.<br />I haven't read the other books in this series yet so these characters were all new to me. This was also my first book from Silhouette's 'Desire' line which is more sexually descriptive than I've ever read in a romance novel before. The sex wasn't overdone but it may make you blush depending on the type of books you're used to reading. Enjoy! :)	2001-12-10

This is the sequel to &quot;Fit for a Sheik&quot; by Carol Grace. Anne, a sensible school teacher, is bridesmaid in her friend Carol's wedding and meets the groom's cousin Sheik Rafik Harun. Although Sheik Rafik normally prefers sophisticated women he's instantly attracted to Annie. Carol, worried that her innocent friend Annie will be hurt by Sheik Rafik, warns him Anne's not his type. Anne overhears this conversation and tries to avoid him realizing her friend may be right.<br />After taking too many antihistamines at the wedding she makes the mistake of having champagne at the reception and starts to feel ill. Sheik Rafik sees Anne isn't feeling well, thinks she's drunk and sympathetically offers to drive Anne home but she passes out in the car before telling him where to go. Rather than embarrass her by taking her back to the reception unconscious he takes her to his hotel to sleep it off. As he walks through the hotel lobby several people going to one of the restaurants notice him carrying Annie to the elevators and recognize both of them. (This becomes a problem for Anne later since she works for a prestigious school that has strict moral standards for their teachers.)<br />Once Sheik Rafik has Anne in his room he decides to remove her uncomfortable looking bridesmaid dress and puts one of his shirts on her instead. Too tired to return to the party knowing he has an early morning meeting he decides to go to sleep. In the morning he rushes to get ready, leaves Annie money for a taxi &amp; goes to work with Annie still fast asleep in the bed.

She offers a lot of helpful advice on dating &amp; maintaining relationships. I was relieved that she didn't focus on being a gold digger but chose to suggest options for self-improvement, finding the right person to fit your needs (not just financially) and becoming aware of who you are involved with.<br />Since I come from a upper middle class background &amp; so do most of my friends I have seen what happens to women when they date below their own economic class. People think it's just men who get stuck with financial burdens during divorces but that isn't true! Some of my friends have had horrible settlements paying their husbands during the divorce! One friend in particular had a man use her for money &amp; connections then financially took her to the cleaners in the divorce. (No she didn't have a prenuptial agreement but she should have!) Checking out a man's background before getting married &amp; watching for warning signs would have helped her avoid what happened to her.<br />In her book Ginie points out how to check out the man you are dating to see if he is for real. She also has a section on pre-nuptial agreements which is useful to make sure you are protected. The key is to know what you want from a relationship &amp; making sure it's mutually beneficial. Despite the title she's not telling you to use men to get what you want. Ginie tells you to figure out your needs &amp; wants then find the right man with whom you can enjoy a lifelong relationship.<br />Use this book as a resource to find 'Mr. Right' &amp; be ethical about it. Don't let people tell you it's game planning because it's not. No one can't play a game forever and most people will be on their best behavior while dating regardless of whether they read this book or not. Adjusting your habits (especially bad habits), improving your appearance &amp; dating behavior is just common sense when you are trying to find a lifelong partner.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't found the right person yet &amp; wants to find someone to fit into their desired lifestyle.partner. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't found the right person yet &amp; wants to find someone to fit into their desired lifestyle.	2001-10-17

It's considerate to learn a man's food allergies so you don't make him sick or guilty that he can't eat when you cook him a meal. Also if you really like a man it makes sense to learn what perfume he likes or if likes you to wear dresses when you go out.

It was also great to have some of the warning signs to watch out for with men early in the relationship so I don't waste my time or his. Being cautious &amp; not blurting out your entire life story in the beginning of a relationship was really emphasized.<br />I also like how this book mentions having a life outside of a relationship &amp; keeping busy. There is nothing more annoying that reading a self-help book that tells you to spend your whole life wrapped around your husband - how boring, smothering &amp; ancient history! Thank God this book doesn't tell you to give up your friends, family, work &amp; favorite hobbies and interests!<br />It was ironic after I read this book &amp; mentioning it to some of my married friends - who are even more direct than me - they explained they had read this book, followed the advice &amp; finally got their husbands. This book is definetely worth reading!	2001-10-15
