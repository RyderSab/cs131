Este libro narra una realidad de dualismo, por una parte todos los hombres y todas la mujeres, en algun momento de nuestra vida creemos que todo se ha acabado o se esta acabando, pero para la mujer casada con un machista( el 99 % de los hombres lo somos)la realidad podria ser peor. A mi personalmente las aventuras extramaritales me tienen sin cuidado y cada quien las tenga o no sera su asunto. El gran dilema que se plantea aqui es la eleccion: que queremos? Una persona aburrida a nuestro lado, pero buena? que es parte de nuestro yo mas intimo, nuestro conyuge? O una aventura que se quiera o no solo durara un breve espacio de meses a lo sumo? Sobra decir que la eleccion es personal, pero creo que todo hombre y mujer en relacion de riezgo sentimental debera leer este excelente libro. La pasion pasa, el amor si es honesto, es perenne como la hierba... Nunca he encontado en la America Hispana un divorciado o divorciada feliz, y eso algo debe significar...al menos para los que aun estamos casados.	2001-08-16

This was an excellente book while the web did not exist, when there were 2 volumes and its cost was $250, but now with the web( that makes easier the chance to reviews)it is not that good.  The other matter is that a group of orthopaedist have revised the last 4 editions and there are many things that the editor made as mistake, for instance when a technic is described some times the text says &quot;see the anterior edition&quot; (?). That is not good for a very expensive book. Now in this world of the internet we need shorter books and maybe with some kind of year book for up-date the text.	2001-07-31
