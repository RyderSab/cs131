A short introductory part on several pages is followed by the main review part presenting each shortly described project in a combination of excellent B&W photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line presentation drawings, models, sketches, etc. The book is ended with a biography, writings, list of works on several pages. Most of 264 only B&W illustrations are technical, but all (incl. B&W photos) are of a good quality, well balanced, crisp and legible. Like all from the Works and Projects series, it is solid among architectural monographs, but slightly smaller than the same book in German in the Studio Paperback series published by Birkhäuser Verlag under ISBN 3764353503 (Basel)/08176* (Boston) or Artemis Verlag under ISBN 37608* (Zürich)/18740* (London).	2005-10-08

Wheelock, Jr. with Albert Blankert and Jorgen Wadum; Editor: Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr.) is a lavishly illustrated catalog with excellent reproductions for the first exhibition devoted solely to the works of Johannes Vermeer--the 17th-century Dutch painter who explored the psychological nuances of human endeavor--opening at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in November 1995 (Royal Cabinet of Paintings Mauritshuis, the Hague, in March 1996). 232 pp., 127 illustrations including 60 color plates, 12.0 x 9.5 x 0.75 inches.

The colors of most plates are significantly distorted by a brownish (sepia) hue significantly changing perception of the originals, and - thus - rendering the paintings very inaccurately ruining this book's visual appeal. Additionally, a bluish hue destorts at least \\"Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid\\" on p. 147. The 1998 edition from Abradale (ISBN: 0810981939) was affected by the distorting hues, but they may be also present in ISBN: 0810917300 from Harry N Abrams the former was a reprint of.

Many projects also include renderings, plans, models, sketches, site plans, details, sections, hard line presentation drawings, etc.  Following the introductory part on 10 pages with many illustration, each of 64 projects is headed by a title page, half filled with text and half - with illustration(s), followed usually by a page (rarely more) of illustration(s).  There is an assay at the end about WTC proposals followed by several pages with photos of WTC projects. This is an album-like book with a slight tech. edge.  It is similar to the book \\"Skyscrapers:  The New Millennium\\" (ISBN: 3791323431), but only a half of its size.  Like all from the Universe Architecture series, it is compact and well published.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:   Featured here are the London-based urban design projects of Terry Farrell. Each chapter presents a series of recent projects which have in common an indentifiable urban design theme, with an accompanying text detailing its history and urban context.   SYNOPSIS:   For Terry Farrell urban design should be based on a number of principles: a notion of continuum with the history and traditions of a specific area, a priority given to the pedestrian and the experience of the street and a desire to create new places with an identity to encourage the return of the diversity of traditional urban life. Each chapter of this illustrated book presents a series of recent projects which have in common an identifiable urban design theme with an accompanying text detailing its history and urban context. They include the City and Cheapside (with the Paternoster masterplan), the Barbican and London Wall, the River Thames, market halls, railway stations (including Charing Cross), large public institutions (the South Bank), London's natural landscape, parks, squares and open spaces, the private world and outer villages.

This volume also includes illustrations of the sculpture cast by Krier in connection with his buildings.  SYNOPSIS:  The buildings and projects of Rob Krier are informed by his views on the nature of urban space, which are derived from the traditional city and the notion of a \\"res publica\\" or civic realm. Whether house, tenement block or public structure, his work refers to his desire to create space and communal focal points that are invested with functions indispensable to the idea of neighbourhood and community. Beginning with his earliest projects in the late 60s, this comprehensive portfolio throws light upon a creative and indefatigable traditionalist, going from his larger creations in Berlin and the masterplan for the city of Amiens, to the more recent proposals for the Hague and San Sebastian in Spain. This volume also includes a body of sculptural work, cast by Krier in connection with his buildings. His boldly coloured and rendered drawings have earned him a reputation as an artist that is as respectable as his fame as architect and urbanist.	2005-08-27

This book provides the full details of this life of an important figure in the development of modern architecture.\\" <br />SYNOPSIS: <br />F.R.S. Yorke was an influential architect in the 20th century and his book \\"The Modern House\\" set the pattern for architects for the rest of the century. His work is still referred to and seen as forward-thinking. Yorke progressed through his life affecting everyone he met. Beginning as a practising architect he soon went into publishing, writing many articles for the \\"Architectural Review\\" and later writing \\"The Modern House\\". Yorke was the key founding member of the mega-firm YRM, which was to become internationally respected. His clients were varied but most often very rich and so he was able to execute beautiful houses under his own name - without his partners. He spent much time investigating new construction and planning systems, and consequently became further known as an innovater and influencer in new technology. This book provides the full details of this life of an important figure in the development of modern architecture. <br />TABLE OF CONTENTS: <br />Publishing; profession; patrons; prefabrication; planning systems.	2005-08-23

It also examines the work of \\"home-grown\\" architects who have managed to succeed in the UK and the prospects for the emerging generations.\\"   SYNOPSIS:   This text covers the increasing trend of the British establishment to force much of the innovative architectural talent out of the UK to other locations around the world where they find the support to build their designs. Only once these architects have established themselves are they invited back to create buildings within the country in which they live. This phenomena first occurred with James Stirling, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, and more recently with architects such as Will Alsop, Nigel Coates and Zaha Hadid. This book also explores the work of some of the \\"home-grown\\" talent which has been allowed to thrive in Britain, such as Piers Gough, Richard McCormac and Edward Cullinan, as well as some of the younger generation which is just beginning to make its mark.	2005-08-23

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  Miguel Angel Roca is not only one of Latin America's leading designers, but also an architect, painter, writer and professor. This text profiles the range of his designs through contributions by contemporaries of Roca, following his more recent projects in various Latin American countries.  SYNOPSIS:  One of Latin America's foremost designers, Miguel Angel Roca is not only an architect, but also a painter, a writer and a professor. An Argentinian by birth, Roca studied at Cordoba University and with Louis Kahn. Although his methodology and design techniques differ from those of his master, Roca, like Kahn, embraced Modernism without subsequently rejecting it. A multitude of projects has come from his studio - residential blocks, community centres, low-rise housing developments, office blocks, shopping arcades, banks and churches - ranging from the urban sprawl of Buenos Aires to towns in outlying provinces. This monograph contains contributions by leading contemporaries of Roca and follows Roca's most recent and new projects in various Latin Americna countries.    An entirely different book under ISBN: 0312532296 (1985, expanded edition) and ASIN: B0006EA4YW (1981, first edition) is 10 years older, bilingual in English and Spanish side-by-side, smaller in size, equally well illustrated, but mostly in black-and-white.	2005-08-23

Following 17 pages of analysis about the  architect's style, each of the presented 58 works is headed by a description from just a few lines to over a page long followed by from one to several illustrations depending on work's scope.  All of several hundreds only B&W (many multi-picture) illustrations - many of them technical (plans, sections, sketches, elevations, etc.), but also B&W photos of a good quality - are well balanced, superbly crisp and perfectly legible.  A biography, selected bibliography, list of works, etc. on several pages end it.  Like all from the Studio Paperback series, it holds a solid position among architectural monographs even of a bigger size. Similar to smaller books from the Works and Projects series published by Gustavo Gili (GG) in English and Spanish.<br />SYNOPSIS:<br />James Frazer Stirling has been named as one of the most innovative forces of contemporary architecture. With his partner, Michael Wilford (since 1963), Stirling realized numerous projects in which he combined a historic sensibility with a creative architectural language. During the 1980s the office became a major representative of Post-Modernism with the Stuttgart State Gallery, the extension of the London Tate Gallery and the Science Center in Berlin. Since Stirling's death in 1992, Michael Wilford has headed the office and continues the series of projects - for example, the Lowry Center in Salford and the planned Embassy in Berlin. This monograph in the Studio Paperback series documents all Stirling and Wilford's important buildings and projects.	2005-08-23

It examines the effects of the modernist built environment on people and how they express themselves creatively as individuals. <br />SYNOPSIS: <br />For many years, the author has explored social relations and the polemics of contemporary life in urban society. This book centres around the author's interviews and photographic documentation made with people directly involved in their own environments. It examines the effects of the modernist built environment on people and how they express themselves creatively as individuals, looking at the inhabitants of particular housing estates, workers in an office, and a variety of different working and living environments. Photographs are combined with statements where the viewer is guided by the artist bringing out a network of references and infinite number of possible interpretations. Willat's humanistic approach should be of interest not only to artists and art students but also to architects, sociologists and cultural theorists.	2005-08-23

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  Reviews the position of Alsop and Störmer as one of Europe's leading architectural practices. Alsop's developmental paintings are featured throughout and tell of the organic processes involved, of the goal to create space that is indeterminant.  SYNOPSIS:  The position of Alsop & Störmer as one of Europe's leading architectural practices was established firmly in 1990 with their innovative competition-winning scheme for the Hotel du Departement, Marseilles. Entering international competitions on a regular basis has engendered a keen interest for the firm in Europe, where Alsop was involved in collaborative work with European architects Jean Nouvel, Massimiliano Fuksas and Otto Steidle on the Tower Project for Herouville St Clair. The firm's design philosophy believes in keeping a completely open mind about what architecture is. This is reflected in the recent 'family' of projects presented here which are accompanied by incisive texts: the National Centre for Literature, Swansea, the World Trade Centre, Nuremberg, and Kaufhaus des Nordens - the department store in Hamburg. It is significant that for Alsop the process of architectural design emerges initially through painting, a medium which allows him to explore in an unrestricted way the essence of a concept - abandoning the traditional approach chastened by the plan. This idiosyncratic method allows the concept to breathe and interact with its context. It can convey energy, texture and colour. Alsop's developmental paintings are featured throughout and tell of the organic process involved, of the goal to create space that is indeterminate: transcending the confines of architecture that produces a fixed environment, of buildings that cannot be adapted. A high profile UK architectural practice with a growing reputation especially in Europe. Presents in detail three recent exciting projects. Contains stunning illustrations that show organic design process. Authoritative texts outline the open approach of Alsop and Stormer which transcends the fixed architectural environment.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  Established in 1960, Derek Walker Associates has been involved in many award-winning building projects and is closely linked with education in planning and architecture. This monograph analyzes the firm's designs for furniture and interiors through to landscape, infrastructure and urban design.  SYNOPSIS:  Established in 1960, Derek Walker Associates has been involved in a wide range of projects including public and private housing, churches, educational buildings, hospitals, leisure and recreational facilities and shopping centres. Many of the buildings have won special awards and have achieved widespread recognition throughout the world.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  This text portrays the achievement of Panos Koulermos and investigates his architectural work which tends towards a formal expression which is regular and geometric, rooted in the classical Mediterranean tradition and its connections with nature.  SYNOPSIS:  Panos Koulermos was born in Cyprus and received his architectural training in London and Milan. In 1965 he worked in partnership with Nikos Kalogeras and Spiros Amourgis in Athens. He is a member of the Technical Chamber of Greece, the RIBA in Great Britain and the AIA in the United States. Since 1973 he has been Professor of Architecture at the University of Southern California. This text portrays the achievement of Professor Koulermos and investigates his work which tends towards a formal expression which is regular and geometric, rooted in the classical Mediterranean tradition and its connections with nature. It also shows the fusion of forms \\"that evoke the memory of Greco-Venetian culture\\", attempting to fuse \\"Hellenic and Venetian cultural imagery\\". Koulermos's work bridges two cultures: the empirical tradition of Anglo-Saxon Brutalism on the one hand and Italian Rationalism on the other. The more whimsical aspects of his architecture are also explored, as well as his frequent involvement and use of nature.

Shkapich  160 PAGES, 8\\" x 10\\", 104 ILLUSTRATIONS, 29 IN COLOR (mostly sepia monochromatic): excellent photos, plans, sections, elevations, models, axonometric, hard line and graphical presentation drawings.    During the seventeen years from 1972 to 1989 Josef Paul Kleihues produced sixteen designs for museums and exhibition halls in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. This volume comprehensively covers seven of these buildings; including the reconstruction of the Palais Ephraim and the Jewish Museum, the reuilitization of a former monastery as the German Museum for Swords and Blades, as well as an expansion proposal for the Stdel Museum. The evolution from construction to occupancy of the Museum for Pre-History is narrated in photographs by Hlne Binet which capture the spirit of place. Illustrations include architectural plans, models, and sketches.    A poetic rationalist, the strength of Kleihues' work lies in the endeavor to transform the reality of an original site into a new ideal reality in which historical elements, building structure, and the building's context are adapted to his own architectural vocabulary, creating a relationship where building typology and urban form are synthesized.    Foreword by John Jay Iselin. Introduction by John Hejduk. Dialogue between Josef Kleihues and Dr. Claus Baldus. Kleihues studied with Hans Scharoun, has worked with Peter Poeizig, and begin his private practice in Berlin in 1962. In 1979 he was appointed Director of Planning of new construction for the International Building Exposition (IBA) in Berlin. From 1986-91 he was appointed to The Irwin S. Chanin Distinguished International Professorship at the School of Architecture. Published to coincide with an exhibition in the Arthur A. Houghton Jr. Gallery.    Museums deal with history, but also primarily with memory. The term anamnesis was slightly changed from the original when translated to mean remembering. It actually means not forgetting.-Dr. Claus Baldus	2005-07-22

It provides the visual aspect, that combined with \\"Up from Zero: Politics, Architecture, and the Rebuilding of New York\\" (ISBN: 1400060176), presents a comprehensive picture of who, what and when.  Hundreds of illustrations showing also tech. details are beautifully printed in color on glossy paper on a very high level.  They reveal brutally the shortcomings of proposals including the winning one and its evolution from the unrealistic wish that could not have been built at a reasonable cost (incl. the grim pit and gigantic free standing, enormously expensive spire for... coffee drinkers and directly in front of office tower windows) to its more feasible shape and surrounding changed (by others) so much that the overall plan stops resembling the winning proposal, as if the award was only a pretext to install the predetermined winner, and to have the actual planning done by others.

It is a story involving distribution of billions of dollars by those having executive power (combined with exemption from NY City building code) giving the politicians (\\"Emperor\\" Pataki, the Director of LMDC Roland Betts - a close friend and business partner of President George W. Bush, ...) opportunities to establish arbitrary restrictions and allowances regardless of the cost and usefulness, to arbitrarily select the participants of design process regardless of their merit, ability, capacity, and a public interest, etc. They created (initiated and developed) opportunities for favored participants in the design process to gain from their political and not entirely appropriate, but self-serving decisions, which - at the end - bit them, after confronted by a reality check, which exposed their selfishness and ignorance.

The text is in both English and Spanish.  The book comes inside a matching hardcover sleeve with pictorial covers, and has 255 pages with an abundance of full-color photographs and diagrams.  Unfortunately, most of the photos and diagrams is divided by the groove between pages - a result of a very poor graphic design of the book, but $10 for it is still a bargin.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:   This monograph assesses the position of James Stirling, Michael Wilford and Associates in 1993, revealing their plans to continue the high quality of work, despite the death of Sir James Stirling. A selection of built, in-progress and as yet unrealized projects for the future is presented.   SYNOPSIS:   This Monograph assesses the position of the James Stirling, Michael Wilford & Associates office at the present time, revealing its plans to continue the high quality of work, despite the tragic death of Sir James Stirling. A varied selection of built, in-progress and as yet unrealised projects for the future is presented and includes: the Braun headquarters, Melsungen, Germany; the Biennale book shop, Venice; the Science Library, Irvine, Los Angeles; the Faculty of Architecture, Newcastle, Australia; and the scheme for an arts centre, Salford, England. All projects are presented in full colour wherever possible. The beautiful drawings for which Stirling Wilford & Associates has become so well known assist in an understanding of the building and the high level of communication with all parties which the partnership regards as a priority. An essay by Michael Wilford provides an incisive and revealing retrospective of his many years in partnership with James Stirling, and discusses both past and present work. Kenneth Powell provides a perceptive and comprehensive analysis of the firm's oeuvre; Michael Spens contributes a personal interpretation of the firm's recent work and Barry Maitland adds an extra dimension with a description of the scheme by Michael Wilford at Newcastle, Australia. A new look at one of the best known architectural firms of our time. A rare insight into the post, present and future of this influential practice. Comprehensivecoverage of 14 recent and current projects. Essay contributions by Michael Wilford, Kenneth Powell and Michael Spens.

The architects have sought out the way of making them blend in with the scenery. The alluring photos that illustrate this book pay homage to the magnificent creations of architects like Mark Mack, Gabriel Poole, Wolfgang Doring, J. Frank Fitzgibbons, and John and Patricia Patkau. Names which have become famous more recently are also included: Ben Van Berkel, Kazuyo Sejima, Rob Wellington Quigley and Fernau & Hartman. Finally, prize examples by not so well known architects have been chosen: Peter Romaniuk, Iida Archischip Studio, Bercedo and Mestre, Grupo LBC, Gutierrez Cortina, Ramon Esteve, Cristian Boza, Natalye Appel, Peter Gluck, Kappe Studio, Joan Rodon, Valor Frutos Sanmartin and Vincent James. All of these designers found a style for the homes that will inspire the classic residential projects in the future.	2005-04-12

Following 30 pages with analysis of the architect's style, each of the presented 58 of all 250 life works is headed by a description from as little as just a few lines to over a page long followed by illustrations from one to several depending on the work's scope. All of 182 only B&W illustrations - at least a half of them technical (plans, sections, sketches, elevations, etc.), but also B&W photos of a good quality - are well balanced, superbly crisp and perfectly legible. On several pages at the end, there are: biography, selected bibliography, list of works, etc.  However, the other title by Eberhard Syring under ISBN 3822827789 presents only 23 essential works on 96 pages, but depicted by more and bigger photos also in color. Like all from the Studio Paperback series, this book holds a solid position among architectural monographs even of a bigger size. It has not been published in a slightly smaller format of the similar Works and Projects series by Gustavo Gili (GG) in English and Spanish.	2005-02-06

It shows enormous amount of pictorial information on only 246 pages with 126 only B&W multi-picture illustrations well balanced, superbly crisp and perfectly legible, of which at least a half is technical as plans, sections, details, elevations, etc.  The book begins with an analysis about the architect's style on several pages, and ends with biography, list of works, etc. on several more.  In between, there are projects in a chronological order each headed by a description from as little as just a few lines to over a page long followed by illustrations from one to several depending on the work's scope.  Like all from the Studio Paperback series, it is one of the best illustrated book among B&W architectural monographs even of a bigger size possibly including &#34;Mies van der Rohe at Work&#34; by Peter Carter published by Phaidon in a larger format.  Similar to the same book under ISBN 8425214777 published in 1993 by Gustavo Gili (GG) on 208 pages in English and Spanish side by side in the Works and Projects series, under ISBN 0500201285 and 0275495302 in English only published by Praeger first in 1965 and then revised in 1972, and under ISBN 3764355514 not in English, but bilingual in German and French.	2005-01-18

Disappointingly, Centre Georges Pompidou is presented on a few somewhat depressing or irrelevant B&W photos and illegible tech. drawings with white lines on black background.  A few more projects are shown in that manner.  Many photos show everything except architecture (good for social studies), or were made too close to the object showing too little of it, or - too far showing too much sky or foliage, incl. most of the B&W ones. There are not many plans and sections, and mostly too small and/or simplistic (incl. hand drawn). Technical aspect of structure is overemphasized and dominates photos like in a construction handbook.  The fabric of architecture - space proportions and composition is very scarce.  There is a lot of empty paper.	2004-12-13

After 3-page 'Introduction', 22 main Piano's projects are depicted.  Each of them is headed by a title page with a very simple hand drawn sketch or two followed by a page of text and then only full-/double-page photos.  It ends with a few pages with office personnel list, project credits, selected bibliography, prizes, etc., and small B&W photos of coworkers.  This is a non-technical book without plans, sections, or other drawings.  It was very well published, bound, graphically designed, and printed on excellent paper.	2004-12-13
US	51409121	R2BUU51YZ1O1NG	3822859796	181770556	Leonardo	Books	2	36	50	N	N	Dark and brownish reproductions	In ISBN 3822859796 (paperback 'Leonardo Da Vinci, 1452-1519 (Basic Art)' of 2000), some painting and drawing works are reproduced too dark with murky spots, where most details are indistinguishable.  Additionally, the colors are distorted by a brownish (sepia) hue.  So, on many dark works only basic elements are visible, e.g.: The Virgin of the Rocks on p. 28 and 31, Portrait of a Young Man on p. 48, The Last Supper on p. 53 as well as Burlington House Cartoon (too dark cartoon) on p. 60.  Other works may also be affected. The Last Supper is divided between two pages connecting through Christ's face, and a whole center of the fresco is sunk in a groove between the pages.  The printing is good, and on good paper.  Poor color reproduction is quite common in Taschen's art books published up to early 2000s.  Nevertheless, on average, the Taschen art books are not so bad as this one.  But, the art books by Konemann, Abrams, Rizzoli are better.  It depends on the pictures shown.  The most difficult is to accurately render dark or subtle ones, e.g. by Leonardo or Vermeer.  Taschen is perfect for the pictures without much of halftones, e.g. by Roy Lichtenstein or even Michelangelo... as other publishers are.  The quality of the Taschen's reproduction of art by others falls in between those extremes, but their books are generally quite affordable.	2003-10-16
