Long dismissed as the president between Washington and Adams, McCullough puts Adams in the context of his times and illuminates his invaluable contributions to birth and infancy of the United States.  <br />In addition to describing Adams' achievements, McCullough also paints him as a realistic yet principled professional politician who intrinsically understood what path was best for the United State while being aware of his own limits at the same time.<br />Adams made mistakes in both his personal and professional lives, but this biography corrects a longstanding misconception about his importance to America's development.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-07

AT the same timethe soon-to-be victorious Allies engineered the Armistice, they also manuevered the placement of thousands of combat troops into Russia, still going  through the throes of its revolution.  The Allied Powers convinced the world that the troops were deploying into Russia to protect retreating Czech troops, but the Allies were actually hoping that their troops could rally Russian citizens away from the Bolshevik government.<br />What followed was a confusing and contradictory series of political and military strategies that only resulted in prolonging the war for the deployed allied troops, including over 9,000 American soldiers.<br />While the book captures an obscure but important event in World War I history, it does have a few flaws.  The focus is not on just the US forces, but on all Allied Forces, despite the title.  In fact, the US personnel are mentioned much less than the British and Japanese troops.  At times the writing collapses into a mass of descriptions of Russian cities with no clear indication of their importance.  However, these flaws are outweighed by the author's honest attempt to set the record straight, and can be forgiven.  If you are interested in US involvement in the World War I, you may find this intriguing.	2003-09-07

Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary.  However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves.  He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation.  If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's &quot;The Good War.&quot;  Terkel demonstrates the incredible sacrifice and dedication of the WWII generation by picking a gamut of participants and lets their stories convince us that this was indeed a generation of heroes.	2003-09-07

Paul Jeffers is a solid, well-researched biography of a man whose accomplishments would have been more widely publicized if not for the famous name he had to bear in life.   Roosevelt, Jr was a man with a strong personality and great capability who made his own mark on the first half of this century through his public service and experiences in both world wars.  Jeffers sets Roosevelt, Jr in the context of his famous family and then proceeds to make a strong case as to why he deserves to be remembered in his own right.  In &quot;Mornings on Horseback,&quot; David McCullough described how Theodore Roosevelt, Sr grew up in a close and insular family that provided strength and love to each member.  Clearly, the senior Roosevelt brought this lesson to his own family which spurred them on to great accomplishments.  Recommended.	2003-09-07

In order to squelch a possible mutiny aboard a warship in the early 1840s, the ship's commander executed three accused conspirators, including the alleged reingleader, son of the sitting secretary of war.  While it's easy to pick apart the commander's decision, it's important to look at the events from his perspective and within the context of the times.  Melton provides a balanced chronicle of this event and what possibly motivated the ship's commander to hang three sailors without benefit of a legal court martial.  As a result, this book serves as an important lesson in leadership in general, and not just the military arena.  <br />It's important to remember that the Somers' commander was a politically-connected rising star who was all too aware of the consequences of hanging a cabinet secretary's son, but nevertheless felt his actions were necessary.  The Somers was a small but swift vessel whose loss would be both an embarrassment to the pride of the fledgling US Navy and a danger to other vessels.  The Somers was crewed by mostly teenage trainees who, the captain feared, would fall under the influence of the mutineers into killing the ship's officers and becoming pirates.  Although this entire premise sounds absurd, the circumstances provide a conundrum that would challenge the best military leaders in the world.  <br />Melton presents this entire chapter of Naval history in a clear and lucid manner, without taking sides.  If you're interested in books about the character traits of leaders, forget the management books that are out there.  Read a history of the extreme example of a no-win situation and ponder what you would do if you were the Somers' captain.	2003-09-07

Grattan Acting Ensign, United States Navy Officer	Books	5	8	8	N	N	The naval face of the Civil War	&quot;Under the Blue Pennant&quot; is a rare, firsthand account of naval  life during the Civil War.  For that alone, it would merit recognition, but  it is also a well-written, fascinating history  of the North Atlantic  Blockading Squadron.  Its author, John Grattan, served as a clerk to the  Squadron's commander, which provided him an intimate glimpse into both  major strategic maneuvers and into the daily life of the Civil War sailor  on the Union side.  Many modern military experts view today's joint  operations between all services as a new approach to war.  Grattan's  account provides solid proof that the Union's leaders were planning and  executing combined operations all along.  Grattan recorded his experiences  and observations in a clear, cohesive prose.  What Grattan leaves out in  background detail, is ably provided in editor Robert John Schneller's  excellent introduction.  Although quite lengthy, the introduction places  Grattan's experiences into the overall context of the Civil War.   &quot;Under the Blue Pennant&quot; helps feeling a gaping hole of Civil War  literature by wonderfully illustrating the vital but long neglected naval  side of the war.	2000-09-12

Randall and Nahra pick their subjects ranging from the settling of  the American Colonies to the early twentieth century.  Some of the chapters  discuss the neglected aspects of famous Americans, Thomas Jefferson and his  vacation or Benjamin Franklin's shattered relationship with his Loyalist  son, William; other chapters explore early abolitionists, Indian fighters,  suffragists, evangelists and other Americans who, although not be  remembered, shaped our country.  &quot;Forgotten Americans&quot; is a  illuminating exploration of our historical backwaters.

Corn explores the religous flavor which became  associated with the airplane, and how a career in aviation became regarded  as a mystical, &quot;higher calling.&quot;  Corn also examines how the  bombing raids of World War II, especially on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  shattered that optimism.  Corn devotes separate chapters to such phenomenon  as the unique freedoms discovered by women aviators, the belief of &quot;an  airplane in every garage,&quot; and the boundless optimism in the future  brought about by the airplane held by people in the grip of a crippling  depression.  Although his prose tends to be a little dry at times, Corn  manages to coherently present a time when people embraced technology, and  placed all of their hopes in its &quot;miracles.&quot;  As Corn ably  proves, that time is something Americans will probably never see again.	2000-09-12

In 1969 eight Green Berets were accused of  murdering a Vietnamese who may or may not have been a spy for North  Vietnam.  The case called into question the morality of waging a guerilla  war, the role of the regular U.S. Army in such a context, the control of  the CIA, and the politics of waging an unpopular war.  Stein manages to  weave all of these issues and dozens of key participants in the alleged  murder and its aftermath without losing focus.  Stein's narrative style  flows easily through the perspective of all the key personnel and pulls the  reader into the moral and ethical wilderness these people faced.  Stein is  careful not to pass judgement on the Green Berets charged with the crime,  or on the regular Army establishment who may have seized on this incident  just to put the Green Berets in their place.  Instead he allows the reader  to face the same dilemma all of these people did and make their own  choices.  An outstanding piece of historical writing.	2000-09-08

Robotti and Vescovi  not only explore the development of U.S. Naval strategy, they also discuss  the growth of U.S. foreign policy, the disputes with the Barbary States,  and the causes of the War of 1812.  During the U.S.A.'s first hundred  years, merchant and military vessels were its representatives to other  countries.  The U.S.S. Essex certainly represented Amercia in both peace  and war, and through this ship, we can see the development of the American  presence in the world arena.  Vescovi and Robotti also provide revealing  glimpses of the daily life of the men who served aboard an early American  warship.  Thoroughly researched, but briskly written, this book recaptures  a way of life long vanished, while tracing the roots of American military  and foreign policy.	2000-09-08

Of these, &quot;Downtown&quot; is the best, as well as one of his best, period.<br />&quot;Downtown&quot; starts on  Christmas Eve as Florida orange grower Michael Barnes, in New York on  business, runs afoul of bogus cops, thieves, the mob, and a slimy movie  producer. McBain piles on the action and absurdity at a furious pace as  Barnes sinks deeper and deeper into the worst New York has to offer.   McBain has always been adept at infusing his hard-boiled fiction with a  sardonic humor that borders on the ludicrous.  In &quot;Downtown,&quot; he  proves he can still walk that tightrope as he balances the hilarity of  Barnes' situation with a lean, hard-hitting narrative style.  <br />In fact,  McBain's humor is so deliberately distracting, you don't realize it when he  turns deadly serious.  Michael Barnes may be bounced from one jam to  another, but he too has a dark side, like most McBain characters.  When  pushed enough, he too becomes as deadly as his foes and as hard-boiled as  any Raymond Chandler creation.  &quot;Downtown&quot; is another example of  Ed McBain at his best.

Richter employs his usual mastery of language to give this tale an  authentic ring.  As usual, Richter describes in detail the daily life in a  small town during this time period.  Although it's ostensibly a children's  story, Richter almost seems to be writing at his usual level, which might  make the language and plotting a little hard for the very young children to  understand.  For older children, this story will serve as a testament to a  vanished American way of life and might stimulate some interesting  questions.	2000-05-21

Lester I. Tenney narrates his own story of the cruelty he suffered with a tone of courage and hope. Tenney was captured by the Japanese in 1941 and forced on the  infamous Bataan Death March.  Following that, he was used for slave labor  until liberated in 1945.  Tenney describes in vivid detail the inhumane and  evil behavior of his captors and guards, and how he managed to cling to  hope in a place where hope died for most men.  This is not a scholarly  work, but it is educational and enlightening.  Tenney manages to tell his  story in a deeply emotional and personal manner without resorting to a tone  of hate and recrimination.  By doing so, he accomplishes the  near-impossible:  living through a nightmarish experience and still being  able to discuss it rationally.  This is an engrossing story that reflects  personal history at its best.	2000-04-24

As a writer, Cormier's main strength is creating realistic and flawed heroes who are not always  above the fear and temptations of daily life.  In short, his characters are  like you and me, and if they're lucky, they'll do the right thing.   However, if Cormier's characters do make some tragic mistakes, they'll  learn from it.<br />Tommy Bartin, the protagonist from &quot;Take Me Where the  Good Times Are,&quot; is a 70-year-old resident at the local Dorchester  County, MA poor house who was brought in because he could no longer live or  work on his own.  For the past three years, Tommy has been bragging to the  other residents about how he'll return to town, get his job and apartment  back, and in short start life anew.  When another resident leaves Tommy  some cash, he sees his opportunity to go back to the life he left behind.   Like the typical Cormier hereo, Tommy lives in a world of self-delusion and  when confronted with the truth, he tries to hide from it.  Tommy finds that  his town has changed, his beloved factory closed down, and his friends  fearful of this embarrassing ghost from the past.  Tommy drifts from bar to  bar, hoping to find a way to be useful again, and to regain his  self-respect. <br />Although Tommy is in denial, he's not stupid or  insensitive.  Most of his plans end in heartbreak and tragedy as he learns  to accept he's not the man he used to be and, more importantly, that maybe  the man he used to be wasn't that wonderful to begin with. However,  eventually, he will learn to balance his hopes with the harsh reality of  the world, like we all have to. Perhaps he will succeed; after all how can  anyone live in such an ugly world without at least a little denial? <br />As  always, Cormier has delivered a story that features flawed but sympathetic  people involved in a simple but engaging plot.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-24

No other writer can match Richter's ability to capture the spoken word of a region or particular time period, or equal his aptitude in  turning a simple chain of events into powerful story telling.  This novel  chronicles the end of the New Mexico frontier as seen through the eyes of  Hal, the nephew of one of the last great cattle ranchers.  As civilization  encroaches even onto that remote region, Colonel Jim Brewton symbolizes the  last struggle and eventual submission of the land to the inevitable  development of the forces of society.  Richter also weaves Brewton's  marriage to an unfaithful wife and his relationship to their children into  this conflict.  Although this plot appears derivative and indentical to  that of a soap opera, Richter's prose style elevates it to the status of a  great tragedy.  Richter clearly mourns the passing of the great  independents whose struggle to develop the land clearly and ironically led  to their own obsolescence.	2000-04-22

Middlebrook sinks into the faceless society that America has become.   Middlebrook efforts to escape the authorities reveals the kindness of those  who aid him and the ugliness of those who thwart him or just view him  indifferently.  <br />This would have been a good novel reflecting the anger  and frustration of the post-war 1970s, but Cottonwood disrupts the flow at  times with ghostly encounters that muddy the narrative.  Even taking that  shortcoming into consideration, this book will make you think.   Cottonwood  has a gift for story telling and for capturing America's mood in the early  1970s.	2000-04-19

This collection, issued in 1974, by Oliver Jensen  of American Heritage Magazine is essentially a second look at this late  nineteenth century self-portrait through more modern eyes.<br />As Oliver  Jensen states in his preface, these pictures are an idealized view of our  country, and are not to be taken as representative.  The engravings are by  both well-known and obscure artists, and all are beautifully done.  Here  are pictures of various cities, rivers, mountains, and lakes from the  Gilded Age, but without any of that period's cynicism.  Even the cities  seem to take on a pastoral quality that is both striking and impossibly  sentimental.  If you want to see how artists viewed the idealistic and  proud hopes of late nineteenth century America, then I recommend this book.   If you want to see photographs of the late nineteenth century, then I  recommend &quot;American Album&quot; and &quot;America's Yesterdays,&quot;  both by Oliver Jensen or Michael Lesy's &quot;Dreamland&quot; .	2000-04-19

Unfortunately, this book only includes a cross  section of the types of military vehicles from the past and present.  In  his introduction, Halberstadt himself admits he selected the vehicles he  was most interested in.  As a result, this book is by no means  authoritative.  Over half of the book is dedicated to tanks, and although  its supposed to include the World War I period, it barely touches on the  vehicles from that conflict.  <br />Despite these self-imposed limitations,  this book does contain wonderful photographs and statistics on a select  list of military vehicles, especially tanks from both sides of World War  II.	2000-04-16

Newcomb's &quot;Abandon Ship!&quot; succeeds in its primary goals of sifting through the reasons behind the sinking of the USS Indianapolis during the last days of World War II, and attempting to get  behind the Navy's assignment of blame immediately afterward.  Newcomb, a  naval war correspondent, uses the reporter's tactics of extensive  interviews and thorough research of unclassified documents to succinctly  lay out his case for what happened and why.  <br />In July, 1945 a Japanese  submarine torpedoed the cruiser Indianapolis with almost 1,200 sailors on  board.  Eight hundred men made it off the ship, but when recovered four  days later, only 300 of the crew were still alive.  Five hundred men died  of shark attacks, exhaustion, dehydration, drowning, and other conditions  related to exposure.  The ship's commander, Capt McVay, survived to face  court martial charges for actions allegedly contributing to the loss of his  ship.  The Navy even called the Japanese submarine commander that sank the  ship to testify against Captain McVay.  This was the only time a ship's  captain was court martialed for losing a ship in wartime.  After the court  martial, the Department of the Navy also publicly assigned blame to other  Naval personnel, who weren't even previously considered, for failing to  report the nonarrival of the Indianapolis into Leyte.  The Navy never  admitted to the gaping hole in its policy that allowed the nonarrival of a  major vessel to literally &quot;slip&quot; beyond notice.  This failure to  check up on the ship's nonarrival contributed to the majority of the  Indianapolis' crew dying through exposure and shark attacks.  The men were  in the water for four days until a US plane sighted them by chance. No  resuce efforts were launched until then.  The architects of this policy  were the Navy's highest ranking officers, and they weren't ever considered  for punishment.<br />Newcomb succeeds in piecing together the roles of several  dozen key participants in the tragedy to explain what happened and why.   His long experience with military organizations also enables Newcomb to  translate the events for the lay reader.  The book does suffer in its  narrative prose at times due to Newcomb's colorful and fanciful phrasing,  but in key passages it soars.  Newcomb weaves over a dozen different  perspectives of the sinking by crewmen in various parts of the ship to  paint a vivd picture of what the ordeal was like.  He also captures the  atmosphere of Captain McVay's court martial and puts it in context with the  average American's view of the sinking.  At these times, the book crackles  with tension.  Newcomb's description of the sailors' ordeal in the water is  lacking some realistic details, probably in deference to readers'  sensibilities.  After all, Newcomb wrote this only 13 years after the  sinking.  Many relatives and loved ones were still alive, and perhaps he  wished to spare them anything graphic.  <br />Newcomb has clearly done his  homework through countless interviews and exhaustive research.  However,  his access to Navy records was severly limited due to the relative  freshness of these events in the public and the Pentagon's eye.  With over  50 years between the sinking and now, the story of the Indianpolis bears a  second look.<br />Until then, this books still stands as an informative and  riveting work.	2000-04-13

This slim volume contains the inscriptions on Washington, D.C.'s major monuments and memorials.  The author, Clint  Ensign, prefaces each featured memorial with a brief synopsis of the  monument and why it or the person it commemorates is significant to our  history.  However, the book's main purpose is to present the inscriptions  on these memorials.  <br />By truly reading and understanding these passages,  the purposes of the memorials become even clearer.  Usually, a tourist  doesn't have time to appreciate the wisdom and strength of Abraham  Lincoln's words when confronted by his massive memorial, but careful study  of the quotations leads to understanding that a monument is more than a  massive statue, but rather a tribute to an idea.<br />Ensign admits this is  not a comprehensive work, but the prominent monuments as of 1994 are  featured here.  This book sorely needs to be updated and put back in print.	2000-04-13

On his 1994 attempt to re-trace William Tecumseh Sherman's trek from Atlanta to Savannah, Jerry Ellis searches for vestiges of that traumatic time reflected in the people he meets along the way.<br />This book is an  unsuccessful hybrid of social history and an &quot;on-the-road&quot;  travelogue.  Ellis uncovers no previously undiscovered traces of the effect  of Sherman's journey in the New South and after a while it appears he loses  sight of his goal.  This book has one saving grace:  Ellis's natural  story-telling ability which captures the spirits of the people he  encounters.  However, this bright spot isn't enough to compensate for  Ellis's failure to achieve his original objective; it just turns this into  a passable diary of someone's hike.	2000-04-11

Under her own name and the nom de plume of Idris Seabright, she has produced some of the edgiest and  darkly fascinating fiction of any writer from the 1940s to the 1950s, her  most productive period.  The reason why St. Clair is hard to define is  simple:  her stories usually take place in the science fictional realm of  other planets, but at the same time the plots closely resemble the best  horror fiction of Robert Bloch, with its own distinctly adult twist.<br />It's easy to say that &quot;The Gardener&quot; is simply the story of  how a self-important bureaucrat gets his comeuppance when he displeases an  otherworldly arboreal protector, but it's more than that.  St. Clair's  power of description creates an almost clautophobic atmosphere and by the  story's end, the reader is gasping for air.  Few of the stories in this  book end happily; the protagonists don't seem to deserve happy endings, or  that's just the way it goes in an indifferent galaxy beyond their  comprehension.  St. Clair's best known story is probably &quot;An Egg a  Month From All Over&quot; which chronicles a rather sordid man's hobby of  hatching exotic eggs and what happens when his latest acquistion responds  to his darkest desires.  Do we really want to know what we secretly yearn  for?  St. Clair forces us to explore this thought in a science fictional  context.  In &quot;Hathor's Pets,&quot; she takes the frequent science  fiction theme of humans kept as pets by aliens of higher intelligence;  however St. Clair sidesteps the common ending of these humans outwitting  their seemingly superior &quot;masters,&quot; and give us an a chillingly  logical ending that will stay with you for days.<br />St. Clair's power as a  writer doesn't come from providing an unexpected twist to her stories.  No,  that would be too easy.  Her power comes from providing the logical finish  to what she started, even though that might be even harder to accept and  handle.  St. Clair is truly a hard writer to define.  She used fanciful  setting to make us take a hard, unflinching look at the darkest corners of  our souls.at she started, even though that might be even harder to accept and  handle.

Pope Brock takes a long-held  family secret and turns it into a riveting drama of adultery, jealousy, and  murder.  Young up-and-coming politician Ham Dillon becomes involved with  his wife's older and married sister, fathers her child, and ultimately dies  for it at the hands of her tortured husband.  The ensuing trial of his  brother-in-law and its use of the insanity plea only climaxes a local  history that never fails to entertain. <br />Since this story was a closely  kept secret in Brock's family, he is forced to create various key  conversations between the participants.  In fact, Brock's ill-chosen use of  rather florid language to capture these dialogues almost turns this book  into a novel.  <br />What saves this from becoming just another interesting  piece of period fiction is Brock's indepth look into the local politics of  small town America at the turn of the century.  Fortunately, the trial  itself was well-documented, and this adds a ring of authenticity to the  book.  Brock also obviously researched the myriad aspects of daily life  during this time period and he uses this knowledge to ground the events in  a realistic environment. Despite Brock's need to &quot;fabricate&quot;  significant conversations, this book does eventually succeed as an  important piece of local history.	2000-04-09

Charles Tyng's memoir, &quot;Before the Wind,&quot; captures that life in a way histories written  today never can.  Tyng lived a colorful, adventurous life, and had the  ability to record it in a fresh and vivid style.  Tyng's early life reads  like a combination of Charles Dickens and Horatio Alger.  The son of an  affluent but no-nonsense father, Tyng was farmed out to various relatives  and school headmasters until his father sent him to sea, hoping to cure his  son's self-confessed rebellious streak, and to teach him a trade.  Although  this sounds rather severe, it was far from uncommon, especially in large  families such as Tyng's to apprentice or force children to seek their way  at a very early age.  <br />Once at sea, Tyng experienced a variety of  hardships at the hands of sadistic shipmates who seemed to have no regard  for a boy's safety or well-being.  However, his early experiences at sea  energized Tyng's dormant ambition to rise above the position of sailor and  become a ship's officer.  The memoir contains recollections of Tyng's  studies, trips, and early efforts at trading on a small scale.  Eventually  Tyng rose through the ranks to become a ship's officer, captain, and  eventually the owner of two ships.  His memoir is filled with recollections  of entrepreneurial deals, mutinies, and pirates.  It is also filled with  the day-to-day details of life aboard a merchant vessel.  In a more general  sense, it is also filled with the routine, but now forgotten, details of  life in the early 19th century.  One notable quality of this memoir is how  Tyng's tone actually changes from that of an overwhelmed and somewhat  unruly &quot;ship's boy&quot; to a mature, ambitious, and self-assured  ship's captain and merchant.  This change and growth in character seems  natural and unforced, which lends a greater air of credibility to this  book.<br/>Tyng's story is typical of many New England boys who turned to the  sea and the merchant trade to make their fortune.  In his case, Tyng  actually succeeded at both his chosen trade and in his ability to recount a  life once common, but now forgotten.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-09

Puryear provides enough background information on each general  to put the various decisions and actions into an understandable context.   As a study of leadership and management styles of four successful but very  different military leaders, this book accomplishes its goals.  Puryear  gives the reader adequate appreciation of these general officers and the  contributions they made, not to just the war effort, but to the military in  general.<br />Again, this is not intended to be full-blown biographies on  these military leaders, but rather a leadership study for young officers  and officer candidates.  However, this book will serve as an able  introduction to the lives of these fascinating men, and will probably  inspire a broader audience than just military members to look into more  indepth works on these key leaders.	2000-04-09

Hyman Rickover Built the Nuclear Navy	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Detailed, but biased account of a Navy maverick	&quot;The Rickover Effect&quot; is a fascinating depiction of Admiral Hyman Rickover's efforts to build the nuclear Navy.  This book is not intended to serve as a comprehensive chronicle of Rickover's career and  private life, but as a chronicle of Rickover's accomplishments in bringing  nuclear power to the Navy as viewed by a subordinate.  Within these  self-admitted limitations, the book succeeds, but Theodore Rockwell also  attempts to turn Rickover's leadership style into some sort of management  primer.  <br />Rockwell examines various anecdotes and discusses the  effectiveness of Rickover's management acumen in dealing with both  political and technical problems.  This attempt to explain &quot;The  Rickover Effect&quot; is rather clumsy and unnecessary.  The reader can  judge for him or herself the success of Rickover's abilities.<br />Readers  unfamiliar with Rickover's personality must keep in mind that this account  is written by someone who obviously admired and respected Rickover a great  deal.  Rockwell's close association with Rickover has caused him to see the  Admiral through biased eyes.  Rockwell sees Rickover as firm but fair,  which isn't entirely accurate. Although truly a visionary, Rickover was  extremely difficult for most military personnel to get along with and prone  to frightening fits of rage.  Although he was often the target of attacks  on his character, Rickover often treated his political enemies and  detractors cruelly, and at times led his own vicious attacks.  Rockwell  appears sincere in his treatment of Rickover, but it is obvious he doesn't  see the  Admiral as an outsider would.  <br />With these limitations in mind,  this is actually a very entertaining account of how the nuclear Navy  started.	2000-04-09

It's  probably difficult for modern readers to truly grasp the impact First Mate  Owen  Chase felt when his ship the Essex sank in the middle of the vast  Pacific Ocean, leaving 20 men to fend for themselves in three frail whaling  boats.  In 1820, the loss of the ship meant that Chase and his men were  truly on their own.  His account and shock reflect the enormity of what  losing a ship meant to these men.  The ship was their world and without it,  they faced an ardorous journey.  Chase also accurately captures the shock  of seeing a whale attack his ship twice.  An experienced whaler, Chase  watched dumbfounded as a creature he always thought to be gentle and placid  appear to deliberately sink the Essex.  <br />Chase has managed to balance  these feelings of anguish and fear with determination to survive.  His  story also vividly recounts a bygone time when Nantucket whalers seemed to  own the seas, and industry at home depended on the oil these men brought  back.  We seem to forget that whaling and its fruits were an essential part  of early American commerace and life.  This book puts Chase's account of  his survival clearly in context with its times.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-09

It weren't for the fact that I've heard of some of these events from other sources, I would have been hard-pressed to  believe it.  As it were, the book reads like a fictional screenplay of a  small town in the complete grip of a criminal syndicate.  The crooks own  the cops, the courts and everything in between.  The author, Margaret Anne  Barnes, details efforts by local citizens to stop the lawlessness, but  things come to a head when the state attorney general-elect is assassinated  and a variation of martial law is declared.  These events make for  fascinating reading, and it makes me wonder why this story isn't better  known.  However, the book does suffer from some rather florid writing and  improbable dialogue used to recreate conversations that were held a long  time ago.  Barnes' use of language in recapturing these dialogues weakens  the book to the point that, at times, it sounds like an old pulp novel  where there are only purely good people and purely evil people.  Despite  this simplistic weakness, however, the book does stand as a good example of  local history.	2000-04-09

It's the story of Henner Dellicker, a German immigrant, who comes to  America as an indentured servant, escapes, prospers as a trader, then  distinguishes himself during the American Revolution on the side of the  colonists.  At the beginning of the novel, Dellicker is a well-respected  merchant,freedom fighter and retired statesman, enjoying his golden years.   For a local historian, he recalls his arrival to the colonies and how he is  tricked into indentured servitude.  The ensuing story of Dellicker's life  of virtual slavery and his subsequent escape correct an overlooked chapter  in the development of our country: the injustices of indentured servitude.   Dellicker's service as a military leader and peacetime politician also  highlights the contributions of the Pennsylvania Dutch to the USA's  development as a strong nation.  <br />While the novel contains Richter's  typical passion for accuracy in historical detail and in the spoken  language of the early Americans, it does lack the powerful plotting that  exists in his other novels.  Dellicker's later marriage to the woman who  purchased his contract seems rather rushed and tacked on, as if to satisfy  the need for a romantic subplot.  <br />This aside, &quot;The Free Man&quot;  uses its historic setting to correct several ommissions in popular history  of the contributions of German settlers, and in the contradictions of the  indentured servitude system.  Stephanie Grauman Wolf, in her afterword,  suggests Richter hoped to ease mistrust and hostility directed towards  German-Americans during World War II (when this was written) by  demonstrating their deep roots in our country's history.  Despite this  rather strained moral, this book is at its best when it depicts how one  determined person, regardless of country of origin, can make a better life  for him- or herself in a country filled with promise, and help build that  country into a strong nation.  In the end, it's not important what country  Dellicker is from, but rather what his immigration and subsequent success  represent:  that the USA was built by immigrants looking for a better life  for themselves.	2000-01-02

This  book contains charts and maps of naval battles and voyages accompanied by a  narrative text on a facing page that explains clearly what happened and why  it was significant.  The maps are in color and are easy to read.  The text  is not overly complicated, but not so simplified that it's useless.

There is also an  alphabetical listing of each recipient to make research on an individual  recipient easier.  The citations themselves range from well-detailed  summaries of acts of bravery, to rather sparse descriptions.  This  difference in the citations illustrates the evolution of the Medal from its  distinction as the only medal given for courage during the Civil War to its  recognition as the ultimate decoration for bravery in later conflicts.   <br />Overall, this is a very useful tool for researching American military  history.	2000-01-02

While I want to praise James Carroll for trying make peace with his father, he shies away at the end.  While the Vietnam War divided countless American families, Carroll's story is unique:  he was a reluctant priest,  his father was a celebrated Air Force general officer and former novitiate  himself, and he personified his mother's greatest dream of providing a son  to the Priesthood.  While I can't comprehend the strains that Carroll  experienced with his father over the justness of the Vietnam War or the  guilt he felt at leaving the Priesthood, I did expect him to come to some  sort of resolution with the conflicts that divided them.  However, he  couldn't do it while his father was alive, and he can't do it now.  The  book ends with his thinly veiled ramblings about how he was right, while  his father was wrong.  He never resolved anything, and never even bothered  to look at the situation from his father's perspective.  I want to praise  Carroll, but without some sort of emotional growth, I don't understand why  he wrote this book.  He certainly didn't seem to learn anything.	1999-12-30

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Touching testament of the human will.	&quot;A Wartime Log&quot; is a collection of photos of World War II aviators' artwork created while held prisoner in Germany.  During the war, the YMCA distributed logbooks to prisoners through the Red Cross.  Bored  and fatigued through hunger, the prisoners expressed their yearnings for  freedom, the girl back home, a good meal, and other things through  drawings, sketches, and cartoons in these books.  The POWs created paint  thorugh colored Red Cross parcel labels and brushes from their own hair.   The results are beautiful sketches that depict the frustration of sitting  out the war in captivity, the wistfulness of missing your loved ones, and  the simple joy of dreaming about the meals you'll eat when you're finally  free.  The pictures range from humorous drawings of daily camp life to the  hauntingly stark sketches of a lonely Christmas in captivity.  Many of the  prisoners were artists before the war, or discovered latent talent while  serving as POWs.  The work inlcuded here rivals the best efforts of  professional artists.  More than anything, these drawings serve as a  testament to the will, ingenuity, and faith of these great men.<br />Along  with the pictures, the book includes a text which explains the stories  behind the sketches, and provides background information on POW life.   While informative, the text doesn't try to overshadow the book's real  purpose, which is to display these wonderful pictures.	1999-12-30

Mr. Ryan corrects a long-standing error in our history of the space program by chronicling the manned ballooning programs that occurred before NASA, and still continued to explore the limits of man's endurance while  NASA was still finding its niche.  <br />While scientists debated the limits  of man's endurances to high gravity stress, a group of underfunded doctors  and test pilots in New Mexico were pushing these limits on their own.   While forgotten to most Americans who have learned to revere Shepherd,  Glenn, and Aldrin, the contributions of Stapp, Kittenger, and the others  made the space program possible.  While others were focusing on rockets,  these people used the relatively cheap balloons to send men high enough to  determine if manned space travel was even possible.<br />Mr. Ryan's narration  is brisk, but yet detailed enough to give you an appreciation for the risks  these people took.  The events are exciting and groundbreaking, and Mr.  Ryan does them justice with his narrative style.  <br />As an Air Force  member, I was stationed at Holloman AFB, NM (the site of most of these  events) 15 years ago and had heard of these programs and what these  scientists and pilots accomplished.

First published in 1956, &quot;Cop Hater&quot; was Ed McBain's first novel in the long-running 87th Precint series, and it's lost none of its freshness or edge.  The 87th Precint series is unique in its ability to  deftly combine the police procedural narrative technique with excellent  characterization.  While there is not a disappointing entry in the series,  this one is in the top five.  While later novels tend to be more  introspective and more indepth, the first several were lean, tough, and  hard-hitting.  <br />This novel introduces Det. Steve Carella and his fellow  detectives at the squad as they try to find out who is murdering fellow  cops and why.  Although these characters will grow and expand in later  novels, McBain ably sets the stage here, and truly hits the ground running.   There is no awkwardness or hesitation as seen in other debut novels.  As  always, the strongest supporting character is McBain's fictional city of  Isola which combines the best and worst qualities of several major U.S.  cities, especially New York.  McBain describes his city and its citizens  with a palpable rhythm that stays with you after you're done reading.  With  such a diverse and fascinating backdrop to work from, 87th Precint novels  will never drag. Truly a masterwork.	1999-12-22

However, having been to the monkey reserve in Nagano, Japan, I can say  that the photographs capture the monkeys' daily life in a vivid,  unforgettable way.

Often overshadowed by the Second World War, the USA's involvement in the Great War is merely considered as setting the stage for that later conflict.  However, American involvement in WWI helped turned the tide in  favor of the Allies, and also changed America forever. This excellent book  manages to detail America's involvement in WWI from both the point of view  of specific battles, and from the perspective of the home front.  The main  strength of &quot;The Last Days of Innocence&quot; resides in how  successful the authors are in explaining how WWI changed the USA's  government and it's cultural outlook.  Such an effort as training,  equipping and sending millions of trained soldiers overseas required a  massive mobilization which in turn needed complete cooperation from all  stratum of society.   Those who didn't cooperate were labeled subversive  and investigated.  Minorities were given the worst assignments.  President  Woodrow Wilson thought private organizations could be depended upon to  police themselves.  The country's longheld philosophy of limited government  involvement in the daily lives of its citizens disappeared forever and  painfully as a price of going to war.   The authors depict accurately how  confused and tumultuous all of this was for the average American and how  these effects are still being felt today.  WWI was truly a turning point  for the United States and this book captures its impact and signficance.  Highly recommended.	1999-06-11

While this dictionary is very useful for those already asociated with the military or Department of Defense, it won't be as helpful for those who are not familiar with the  Armed Services.  This dictionary contains listings  of acronym and spells out what they stand for, and what service it applies  to.  This is useful for those already associated with the military who may  know what the term means, but want to spell out exactly what each letter or  symbol in the acronym stand for.  For example, it may tell you that  AMC  stand for Air Mobility Command, but it won't say what that is or what it  does.  Thus, it's useful if you know what AMC does, and need to what the  letters stand for.   If you're trying to learn what these organizations and  programs actually do, then pass this dictionary by.   Again, if you have  experience in the military, then you will probably be able to use this  dictionary with no difficulty and find it quite useful.	1999-06-11

Books	4	15	17	N	N	Illuminating overview of life at the turn of the century.	&quot;The Good Old Days-They Were Terrible!&quot; is a sharp and unflinching  overview of day-to-day living from the end of the American Civil War to the turn of the century, which employs contemporary sketches,  cartoons and photos to make its point that these years were not the idyllic  times  we think them. Otto L. Bettmann uses his vast archive of  illustrations to not just show us just how hard and fraught with danger  this period of time really was, but also to give us a fascinating look into  a vanished time.  While his main purpose is to show us that these times  weren't peaceful and carefree, Bettmann also illustrates the mundane  aspects of any period of time, IE health, work, education, crime, housing,  etc.   All aspects of a routine day are covered here, which makes this  social history at its best.  We discover that the inhabitants of this  period had the same concerns and problems that we do today. It's all here:   garbage in the streets, dirty drinking water, prostitutes protected by  cops, child-beating, etc.  Definitely not a simple, beautiful time.  It's  life like any other period, and it's captured here. Bettmann's commentary  is concise and mainly supports this book's real strength:  it's expressive,  contemporary illustrations.  As journalism is the first draft of history,  these illustrations serve the same purpose in telling us how things really  were and how the inhabitants of these times saw their lives. Excellent  social commentary.	1999-06-11

It is always  reportable to the President through the chain of command.  This unpleasant  fact changes our views of such genial and progressive presidents such as  Ike JFK.  These two, in particular, were willing to assassinate foreign  leaders.  It's far easer for us to blame such activities on an  out-of-control organization operating in the shadows.  This book firmly  establishes that the intellgence community, clearly works for the  President. Christopher Andrew explores this complex relationship between  President, the ultimate user of intelligence, and the intelligence  community, the tool of leadership.  Andrew makes a strong case for idea  that the intelligence community merely serves the President and its  effectiveness is based on him.  This book explores how each president  regarded and used intelligence.  It's fascinating and well written.    HIghly recommended.	1999-05-26

It's the development of the United States into a super power and of the build-up of  a massive intelligence network.  At the center or  sometimes fringes of all this dwelled Allen Dulles. Dulles' influence on  intelligence gathering and covert activities still dominates our country,  even though he left the CIA over 35 years ago.  His love for the great game  of espionage inspired young disciples who in turn became key leaders of the  intelligence community.  It's easy to praise or blame Dulles for many of  the problems that we are still experiencing today due to lack of honest or  accurate analysis, or involvment in the affairs of duely elected foreign  governments.  Peter Grose has mapped Dulles life in this massive biography  and has done an excellent job of exploring Dulles' mind as to why he did  what he did.  The book is never boring. Dulles set the image of the  &quot;American Gentleman Spy,&quot; as being witty urbane and downright  ruthless.  Peter Grose has provent hat Dulles blended himself into that  image seamlessly.	1999-05-26

Miletich has undercovered the real significance of this event.  The heavyweight  Championship fight that gambler and &quot;sport&quot; Dan Stuart tried to  bring about set off reactions that reverberated from state capitols to the  Capitol Hill.   These events occurred in 1894, at the height of the Gilded  Age and the beginning of a great progressive movement in America.  Dan  Stuart of Dallas, TX promised he would set up a series of boxing matches  which would bring revenue to Dallas and the chance for some serious  wagering.  Stuart unwittingly stirred up a political and religious hornet's  nest as his attempts to stage the match were thwarted in Dallas, El Paso,  California, Arizona, New Mexico and Mexico.  In fact state and national  political leaders took unprecedented action and haste in drafting and  passing legislation to prevent the &quot;fistic carnival&quot; from taking  place.  Then, as now, many people considered prize fighting immoral, and  judged the crowds that such a spectacle attracted as the dregs of  society.  However, Stuart was just as determined as his opponents and he was going to  keep his word at all costs.  The story that follows mirrors today's events:  some people still protest boxing and deride its followers; boxers still do  their best fighting in the press with their mouths and demand hugh sums of  money; and it's still foolish to try to draft  moral legislation for a  vocal minority.  The actions taken by the governor of Texas left many  contemporary observors shaking their heads and wondering if that's all the  governor of the largest state at that time had to worry about.   Unfortunately, the same things still occur today. Stuart, the  self-professed sport and gambler, comes out of all this as a decent guy who  promised a big fight, and who means to keep his promise without ending up  in jail or dead.How he does it is  the basis of some of the most fun  reading I've had in years. In the long run, this story isn't really about  boxing, but about how fruitless it is to try to legislate an issue that's  morally unpopular with some, but treated favorably, at worst indifferently,  by the majority.  Miletich deserves special praise for his abiltiy to tell  this story in a fresh manner, liberally using contemporary newspaper  accounts and editorials.  Highly recommended.	1999-05-24

Joseph Corn and Brian Horrigan, using a variety of source materials,  present these visions, both optimistic and grim, in a manner that avoids  derision or arrogance.  After all, some of these came true, and, in some  cases, we wish the others had come true.  But, as Corn and Horrigan point  out, that's the beauty of the future:  anything is still possible. The best  way to explore how others viewed the future is through pictures, and this  book has plenty.  Corn and Horrigan draw on pictures, sketches and  illustrations from magazines, TV shows, movies and books.  While many of  these visions, such as Buck Rogers' ray gun or a helicopter in every  garage, are now nostalgic, many others, such as Buckminister Fuller's  houses, still invoke wonder and awe.  Corn and Horrigan provide a balanced  approach to their theme by drawing from both popular culture and the  scientific community's conception of what our life would be like.     The  book runs the gamut from future visions of cities, housing, transportation  and warfare.  Some ideas such as lasers have become commonplace while  others like the flying tanks are prototypes that were passed over in favor  of more practical options.  But as the authors point out, who are we to  judge these ideas from the vantage point of our time? Corn and Horrigan are  careful not to poke fun at these concepts, but instead present them and  explain their significance to the context of the times which produced them.   Both fun and thought-provoking, this book is an excellent glimpse into not  only the future, but into our dreams that make our tomorrows.  Highly  recommended.	1999-05-21

Shays' Rebellion is often dismissed in the history books as an isolated incident following the American Revolution.  Sometimes, it's grudingly given credit for spurring the Constitution Convention.  In this  well-balanced book, David P. Szatmary devotes the time and study necessary  to classify Shays' Rebellion as the historical watershed it truly is.  Shays' Rebellion signified more than economically depressed New England  farmers waging war on creditors; it marked the beginning of the end of the  American subsistence farmer.  This change in an accepted way of life was at  least as painful as the birth of the new United States.  Szatmary  chronicles how international influences forced a change in how merchants,  farmers and artisans interacted, and how the initial changes brought  friction.  The rebellion resulting from this friction in turn revealed how  ineffective the Articles of Confederation were in dealing with a crisis  that could destroy the country.  Szatmary links the state's governments  weakness to the Constitution by using newspaper and editorial accounts of  the day to provide a well-rounded view of an overlooked milestone.	1999-05-19

Edward Larson's &quot;Summer for the Gods&quot; is a masterpiece of historical writing for several reasons:  Mr. Larson always maintains his objectivity; the story is set in the proper context of its times; and  finally Mr. Larson devotes attention to the effect of the infamous Scopes  trial. Having been raised on &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; the fictional  version of the trial, I was astounded to learn the truth behind the trial  and of its eventual impact.  Mr. Larson makes the story fresh even after 74  years, and as noted earlier he takes an objective approach to all sides of  the trial.  In doing so, Mr. Larson corrects several historical  misconceptions and  William Jennings Bryan at last regains his standing as  a remarkable American politician.  The narrative is crisp and never bogs  down the story.  I highly recommend this book.	1999-05-19

In &quot;Plain Speaking,&quot; Merle Miller has weakened the refreshingly unvarnished narrative of this century's greatest president with his own commentary.  Miller, instead of allowing Mr. Truman's words to stand on  their own, insists on unnecessary and inane dialogue.  Also, Miller  comes  off as the type of person Truman hated the most::  a &quot;yes-man.&quot;   Miller should have confined himselt to just clarifying any factual errors  Mr. Truman may have mistakenly made.   Having said that, I do recommend  this book.  Although Miller brings down the narrative flow, Mr. Truman's  story is one of the freshest and most fascinating in the history of  American politics.  Mr. Truman was an amazing man of unusual abilities  whose capacity for straight talking made him even more unique.  He was  present at some of history's turning points and his unique grasp of history  had given him a special perspective.   This book is an excellent companion  to David McCullough's &quot;Truman,&quot; which is an engrossing biography  that provides more balance than Merle Miller does.  Although there are some  discrepancies between what Mr. Truman and Mr. McCullough report, Mr. Truman  would approve.  He always said history is a matter of perspective and each  writer or historian brings something different to the same subject.	1999-05-13

Although finished over a hundred years ago, Mr. McCullough reminds us not to take the Brooklyn Bridge for granted.  By interweaving hundreds of key participants and placing the events in the context of their times, Mr.  McCullough reveals how hard it was to build, but how a determined few  persevered. In fact, with all of the political opposition and in-fighting,  it's a miracle that it did get finished during the height of the  &quot;Gilded Age.&quot;  Mr. McCullough accomplishes one of the historian's  hardest tasks by explaining why something we take for granted should be  important to us living a century later; in other words he puts the struggle  for the bridge in its proper backdrop with all of the colorful charactors  who either contributed to or tried to prevent the bridge's construction.  I  have never been to the Brooklyn Bridge, but after reading this book, I plan  on seeing it soon.  Although the Bridge's story is unique to its turbulent  time, it does transcend that context by celebrating the will and genius of  men and women who know they are right.  The story is universal in its  testimony to the importance of following your beliefs.  Washington Roebling  and his wife Emily stand as true heroes who are still making a difference.  Mr. McCullough is one of our best historians, as this book so ably proves.   Highly recommended.	1999-05-12

Chalmers chronicles the history of the Ku Klu Klan in all of its incarnations, from immediately after the Civil War to the late 1970s.  Mr. Chalmers also discusses the  Klan's development and success (or lack of) in all of the states during its  strongest period in the 1920s to 1930s.  Mr. Chalmers also discusses in  great detail the turbulent 1960s and how the Klan helped inadvertently  brought about  the Civil Rights legislation it fought so hard against.  Exhaustively researched and well written, &quot;Hooded Americanism&quot; is  a factual glimpse into the life of a controverisal organization and into  the lives of the men and women who made it possible. Mr. Chalmers makes  excellent use of contemporary newspaper accounts and editorials to paint  the Klan and its standing in a given community. What I found especially  intriguing was the Klan's demographics.  Mr. Chalmers presents research  that refutes long-held convictions that the Klan was always strongest in  the South; in fact the Klan, at times, ruled the legal governments of the  Midwest.  Mr. Chalmers also discusses how various state legislatures and  governors fought the Klan or sided with them.  Again, I was surprised at  how many governments actually tried to curb the growth of the Klan in their  states through anti-mask laws and other legislation.  This exploded  notions I had that the Klan was unchallenged everywhere it went, especially  in the 1920s.  Mr. Chalmers has written an excellent history that  encompasses in great detail the 100 years following the Civil War.  I hope  that he is at work on updating this important work.

The triumphs and tragedies of the Wheeler family are not  any different from those of real families in this or any time.  That's what  makes this story so special:  showing how special ordinary people are.   Richter's prose strives for the realistic dialects of the region and time,  and that gives this book an additional ring of truth.   What I've admired  about this book is the character of Sayward Luckett Wheeler, who stands  heads and shoulders above any other &quot;strong woman&quot; in American  literature, especially including Scarlett O'Hara.  Sayward is truly the  glue that holds her family and community together and she better than any  represents the American pioneer as a person of strength, stoicism and  compassion.  As the frontier is disappearing around her, Sayward also has  the good grace and dignity to accept that.  She, like her country, is  constantly growing and developing. The first book &quot;The Trees,&quot;  depicted the struggle to eke out a home in the lonely wilderness, while the  &quot;The Fields,&quot; followed the development of an isolated pioneer  community.  &quot;The Town&quot; ties the first two books together while  chronicling the next step in a city's development.   It's a stunningly  simple and beautiful story. I'm not sure if it's possible for anyone to  write the &quot;great American novel,&quot; but if so, then Mr. Richter has  done it three times with this series. You'll want to read this over again  just for the poetical simplicty of the language Strongly recommended.	1999-05-10

Neal Gabler chronicles Winchell's career and life, but it's his  analysis of Winchell's affect on his times and culture that makes this book  transcend routine biography. Winchell's became a powerful voice for a time:   businessmen wanted to be his friend, celebrities needed him, and  politicians feared him.  In fact, most people feared him.  But somehow,  Winchell created a definition of celebrity that has endured even today.   Although he may be forgetton in our conscious memories, Winchell still  looms large in our cultural memory.  This is a stunning biography of a man  who fought hard to get it all and fought equally hard to keep his fame and  recognition as lost it in a blaze of self-destructiveness. One of the best  books I've read in years.	1999-05-08

Conrad Richter's &quot;The Fields&quot; is the middle book of his &quot;Awakening Land&quot; trilogy, and is no less powerful than the first, &quot;The Trees,&quot; with its authentic use of pioneer speech and  dialects, and its realistic depiction of the triumphs and tragedies of real  Americans. Set in the original &quot;West&quot; of Ohio, &quot;The  Fields&quot; continues the story of Sayward Luckett Wheeler as she and her  growing family settle their land and deal with the everyday task of  surviving.  What was a  handful of isolated trapper's cabins in the first  book has now become a collection of settlements that is clearly on its way  to becoming a bustling town.  Sayward, as stoical as always, strongly  confronts every realistic challenge and victory frontier life hands her.   She's a refreshingly  strong feminine character who is truly the reason why  the West was settled.  Her strength and determination holds her large  family together as the frontier is pushed further westward.

Since I read a Jim Thompson novel for the first time, I though he was truly one of America's most gifted and important writers.  A literary heir to the likes of Chandler and Cain, he was, like them, able to raise the  mystery genre to a whole new level of American literature.  Of course,  whether you like Thompson's work or not, is entirely subjective, but if you  admire him as much as I do. &quot;Savage Art&quot; by Ron Polito is an  important key to understanding Thompson and his work. Like most independent  geniuses, Thompson led a hard and often lonely life which he put into his  writing.  HIs characters wear masks so much that they often don't know who  they are.  Polito picks up on this recurring theme and uses it to explore  Thompson's turbulent life and use of masks. This book made me appreciate  Thompson even more and I've reread all of his books since finishing  &quot;it.

With an ear toward authenticity, Conrad Richter has  seamlessly mixed history with fiction by introducing realistic characters  who tamed Ohio when it was the &quot;West.&quot;  The story is simple, but  beautifully told as Richter introduces the Luckett family, especially  eldest daughter Sayward.  The Lucketts claim the land and eke out a living  among a howling wilderness as Sayward becomes the true head of the family.   Richter is to be congratulated for introducing a realisitically strong  character who, representing nameless and countless pioneer women, is a true  hero. Read it for history or read it for fiction, it will touch you and  teach you.	1999-05-08

After reading &quot;Lobster Boy,&quot; the story of the murder of sideshow attraction Grady Stiles, I now understand why people can't turn away from a nasty auto accident:  morbid fascination compels them to stare.  The same  is true for this book.  I always felt a little strange and dirty after  visiting a circus sideshow and that same feeling returned while reading  this book. Rosen reveals a side to life that few people understand or have  experienced.  It's different and who's to say it's worse than what we know?   Regardless, all the details are here for us to gawk at, like circus  attraction.  Although it suffers from weak writing, the story is gripping  and you just can't turn away until it's over.   Entertaining in a sleazy  way.	1999-05-08

In just 200 pages, Tuchman balances an international cast of major and supporting characters; intrigues, both serious and ludicrous; and lessons in the contemporary  state of global politics.    Tuchman wraps this mix up with a crackling  narration that places this whole sordid affair into context without  overburdening the text with cumbersome details.  An incredible  accomplishment, but no surprise since it's a Barbara Tuchman book.	1999-05-08

Hernon  pairs contemporaries from 1789 to 1990 to demonstrate how different  personalities can affect the course of history, and, more significantly, to  illustrate how history was changed by moral conviction or lack of it. In  the course of discussing these pairings, Hernon reveals three overlooked  facts about the Senate.  The most obvious is that history often changes who  we view as heroes and villains, and who we just forget over time. Hernon's  choices for his &quot;portraits&quot; prove that we can't believe  everything our history teachers taught us.  Hernon's excellent ananlysis  demands new, fresh biographies of such personalities as Pitt Fessenden,  Thomas Walsh and George Frisbie Hoar who were able to rise above the party  squabblings for the good of the nation.  This counterpoint is also clear:   we need to look again at such heroes as James Monroe and John C. Calhoun  who truly are overrated and overly admired. The second fact about the  Senate this book illustrates is how powerful the Senate has been in history  and can be again under the proper circumstances.  Every generation since  WWII has regarded the Presidency as the true seat of power, with the Senate  serves merely as an &quot;appendage of the Executive.&quot;  Hernon's  encapsulated histories show that key senators have been more responsbile  for making major changes in our country than most presidents.  While the  short histories don't allow Hernon to exlpore these issues to a minute  degree, he covers enough detail to make his points. Hernon's third point is  simply that the pursuit of the Presidency has at times weakened powerful  senators and undermined their effectiveness and place in history, while  those who were content to stay in the Senate were able to focus on changing  the country and the world. Although I think Hernon proves his points in  only 200 pages, the book could have benefited from more indepth examination  of the times and some of the supporting players in the dramas of the  Senate.  However, this is the book's only shortcoming and overall it's  doesn't detract from the overall effect.  Recommended.	1999-05-06

Every cursory study of the Great Depression and the New Deal includes a brief reference to Catholic priest Father Charles Coughlin whose radio broadcasts savaged FDR and his advisors, but especially attacked the Jews  and perpetuated the myths of Jewish conspiracies.  Always, Coughlin is  mentioned in passing and then the text moves on.  Donald Warren's  &quot;Radio Priest&quot; gives Coughlin and his times the attention and  thoughtful analysis they deserve. Warren asserts that Coughlin was more  than a priest who used his radio pulpit to spread his anti-semetic beliefs,  but also as the father of hate radio.  Warren connects Coughlin's career as  a broadcaster in the early twenties to late thirties to today's radio and  television commentators who champion racism in the name of fair-mindedness.  In times of great poverty, Warren says, those who feel disenfranchised and  powerless need to be part of the system or need to tear it down.  The Great  Depression and Coughlin seemed made for each other, and the priest  definitely used the anger of the working class to propel himself to fame  and eventually notoriety.    Coughlin eventually alienated himselft from  the government and his own Roman Catholic superiors and accepted an  enforced silence to avoid possible federal prosecution. Warren amply  explores the  Catholic Church's growing discontent and embarrassment of its  priest, and eventual plan to silence him. For those who always wondered why  his superiors didn't stop Coughlin sooner, this books explains it in  detail, including the Church's fear that Coughlin would resign and take his  &quot;radio flock&quot; with him.  He also discusses how the federal  government conspired with Coughlin's bishop to stop the renegade priest.   Unfortunately, there is little discussion as to why the priest did these  things, but Warren can't be blamed for that.  His book stands as a perfect  example of well-researched and clearly written biography.  We just must  accept that Coughlin gave no reason for his professed  hatred of Jews, or  that he actually believed what he wrote and spoke.  The reader is also left  to wonder why Coughlin continued to bait his superiors and his government  despite mounting pressure.   By not speculating why Coughlin broadcast his  vile messages or why he didn't stop until caught in a legal vise, Warren  actually moves Coughlin from his traditional place as a  Depression-era  demagoue to a position in line with  the mass media  hate broadcasters of  today.  The lesson by comparison is chillingly clear:  Coughlin wasn't an  aberrant case, but a pioneer who blazed the way for others.  An excellent  biography and history of America's most troubled and fragile time.	1999-05-06

Thomas Arms manages to put almost 700 entries into one volume and still make it worth  reading.  Arms provides entries on laws, people, policies, and  organizations that shaped the Cold War.  Arms arranges all entries in the  classic &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; style which allows the reader to  review the most important information first.  Arms also provides  cross-references from one entry to another where applicable and a  bibliography at the end of most entries. This is an important reference  when conducting any research on a time period which is already becoming one  of history's most widely debated and discussed issues.  This one has it  all, from the key players and events to some of the more minor and aomost  forgotten ones.  Comprehensive companion to have around when reading  anything abou this period and its participants.  Recommended.	1999-04-27

Marshall	Books	4	32	33	N	N	Excellent overview of the life of a great American	Barely 200 pages in length, this book isn't comprehensive enough to do justice to Marshall's life and accomplishments.  However, as an overview with more attention paid to the years 1939-51, this book is the best place  to start when learning about General Marshall's accomplishments once he  reached high command and his two cabinet positions. Mark Stoller does  manage to convey in such a short work, the impact Marshall's life has had  on America and the world and how we are still feeling that impact.   If  interested in Marshall's early years in the Army, Forrest Pogue's work is  still the best, but this book is a good introduction to the life of a great  man.	1999-04-25

Eddie Rickenbacker was a complex man, capable of great things, but at the same time bound down by his own  prejudices and shortcomings.  A person's life is fascinating when we see  how a such a person rises above his or her shortcomings or how ultimately  they bring him or her down.  Farr's narrative approach is to praise  Rickenbacker excessively to the point I felt that I wasn't reading a  biography any more, but a work of fiction.  Farr deals with Rickenbacker's  prejudices or short-sightedness by downplaying their signficance or by  attacking those making the claims.  Farr can't rise above his obvious hero  worship to realize the obvious:  when writing a biography, present all the  facts and let the readers make their own minds up if this man's life was  beneficial to his country or not.  Rickenbacker was a muliple ace in the  first air war, winner of the Medal of Honor, helped revolutionize the auto  industry, and fathered commerical air travel.  Obviously, he was  multi-faceted and complex and deserves our study.  Since no  one is  perfect, I felt this book was on someone who was  too one-dimensional to  accomplish any of those things.  I'm still looking for a definitive  biography of this important, but flawed, American.  This book is out of  print for a reason.	1999-04-23

The idea of  losing your family in such a way is terrifying and Haizlip captures that  well at first, by portraying her mother's childhood years without her  family even though they were alive and sometimes in the same city.   However, the book loses its momentum due to Haizlip's anger at these  relatives and attempts to make them look foolish, cowardly and petty.  This  is the part of a personal history where it would have been better to leave  the personality out of it.  By the time I had finished reading of the  hardships Haizlip's mother endured, I had already formed my own opinon of  the family that abondoned one of their own.  Haizlip's rage just detracts  from an otherwise excellent American history.  In fact, her angry tone  brings the book's quality down quite a bit.	1999-04-23

Sweeney's voice is the calm in a storm of revisionist histories and thus  carries the most weight.  This is a personal story more than objective  history, but it contains something other studies lack:  a true sense of  context, and that makes it a story worth reading.	1999-04-22

The autobiography of Bill Otter, an Englishmen in  early America, this book shows a far darker side of the working class than  we may have believed.  Otter is a cheat, bully, and bigot, dedicated as  much to playing tricks on people as he is to working.  HIs story is told in  his own words and the jarring difference between the image of the  &quot;good guy&quot; he tries to project and the reality of the rough and  tumble brawler he really was is a revelation.  Richard Stott, the editor,  takes Otter's story and deftly ties it into relatively unknown facet of our  social history.

Volumes have  been written about the Army during various wars and how volunteer forces  contributed to the victories.  Here, Edward Coffman discusses the the  so-called caretaker Army that manned the lonely frontier outposts, and how  it progressed to the organized machine it is today.  Although it's a  natural progression, it's not easy to see it without the strength of  Coffman's narrative and his ability to balance deeply personal views of  soldiers in the field with the major policies issued by the powers-that-be.     Much reviled, maligned, and distrusted by the American public, the  peacetime Army is truely the grandfather of today's modern military.   Although many people credit the temporary wartime armies with that  distinction,  Coffman traces the struggles that the civilian and military  leaders had to endure in order to produce an effective military.  This  excellent work contains revealing excerpts from personal journals that  provide a clear view into this forgotten way of life ranging from reasons  why people joined, deserted, and came back again.  Coffman devotes a great  deal of time to minorities, in the military, and wives and children of the  soldiers to give us a well-rounded view of what garrison life was like.   Coffman also discusses the real, but overlooked work of the early army:   the building of forts, buildings, and public roads.   Long considered a  haven for misfits and incompetents, the Old Army deserves a deeper  scruitiny.  Coffman provides the kind of indepth study that has long been  lacking.  Coffman's ability to focus on the larger history of the Army  while still providing illuminating anecdotes makes this fascinating  reading.	1999-04-22

I find myself reaching for it to read by  itself as much as I do for looking up a reference found in another book.   Americans who participated in WWI were always ashamed of the carnage and  the lack of a clear resolution which ultimately led to WWII.  Thankfully,  this book allows us to appreciate the lost generation's bravery and ability  to deal with the slaughter and destruction.

David McCullough turns the cliche of the Johnstown Flood back into history, and a warm, touching history at that.  In less than 300 pages, he accomplishes a minor miracle of history writing: hundreds of  victims and  survivors, both now long dead, become people to us as we read of their  tragedy and struggle to survive.  McCullough lucidly discusses the causes  of the flood, but still puts a human face on of all these participants.    The Flood was a tragedy that could have been avoided, but, as McCullough  makes clear, it's hard to assign the blame to one person or even group of  people.  The true strength of the story rises from the courage of ordinary  men, women and children during and after the Flood.  Highly recommended.	1999-04-22

Jeannette Rankin lurks as an obscure footnote in the history of American politics.  In school we're told she was the first woman elected to Congress and the only member of Congress to vote against U.S. entry into both World  Wars.  And that's all we're told about her.  Kevin Giles, author of  &quot;Flight of the Dove&quot;  attempts to fill in the gaps by detailing  Rankin's education, involvement in the suffrage movement and struggle for  world peace.  Unfortunately, Giles faces a significant and self-admitted  stumbling block:  Rankin wrote very little of her ideas and methods for  attaining peace or her other ambitions.  This shortage of material makes it  harder to picture Rankin in the context of her times or to understand what  drove to do what she did.  Giles fails to make up for this lack of material  by quoting contemporary newspaper accounts that wrote about her.  He also  fails to delve deeply into personal journals and memoirs of Rankin's  colleagues and contemporaries.  While using some of these sources, he  mostly summarizes them, producing a defensive condescending biography.  Jeannette Rankin wasn't perfect and some of her ideas may have been wrong,  but she deserves a better biography than this.  She was a woman who opened  a lot of doors and stood by her principles while living in a fish bowl,  observed by harsh skeptics just waiting for her to make a mistake.  She  deserves to be understood and brought back into the American pantheon.	1999-04-20

The Batallion, or San Patricios, was a military unit fighting for Mexico comprised of mostly US Army deserters.   Lauded in Mexico and reviled in the United States, the San Patricios became  a force to be reckoned with and sometimes even feared by their former  comrades-in-arms.  Robert Ryal Miller uses the history of the Batallion to  also examine the US-Mexican war itself, which provides an excellent  overview of a conflict given little attention in our school's history  books.  Miller deftly captures the fever of manifest destiny which was  gripping the USA at that time to show how the San Patrcios felt more  sympathy with their Mexican enemies than with what they viewed was a cruel  and personally oppressive United States Army.  This is historical narration  at its best.  The San Patricios were a puzzling aberration, and Miller does  their story justice with a crisp,  objective narration balanced by careful  research.  HIghly recommended.	1999-04-20
