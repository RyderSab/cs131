Jeff Herman founded his million-dollar literary agency at the tender age of 26; then he began telling people how to make it in his world.  Write the Perfect Book Proposal: 10 That Sold and Why (now in its second edition) is a tremendous resource, and yet manages to deliver &quot;just the facts, ma'am, just the facts.&quot;  <br />There's no extra verbiage here:  in twelve extremely brief chapters, Herman outlines your book proposal and tells you how and why to follow his advice.  The book (which may be read in one sitting) would be worthwhile just for this.<br />Even so, its real value lies in the second section, which contains ten full-length, very different, successful book proposals, annotated in the margins by Herman for maximum instructive force.  This is a real treasure, and will radically jump-start almost anyone's efforts.<br />Whatever other  books you have, this one should be on your shelf and in your hands.	2002-02-22

Vann Woodward's The Strange Career of Jim Crow is not only a fine introduction to its topic -- the segregationist period in the South -- but one of the most significant and influential books of its time.  <br />Originally published in 1955 (by Oxford University Press), Professor Woodward's tome kicked off the Civil Rights era with a bang, debunking the ludicrous myth (and mantra among segregationists) that separation of the races had always existed in Southern life, and generally dissecting an ugly monstrosity which had come to be accepted simply as &quot;the way things are.&quot;  Ten years later, in a second revision which came just as the legal battle against segregation was almost won, Woodward added a wealth of information which helped finish the job of winning the people's hearts and minds:  in the words of Robert Penn Warren, Woodward's work was &quot;a witty, learned, and unsettling book.  The depth of the unsettling becomes more obvious day by day; which is a way of saying that it is a book of permanent significance.&quot;  And ten years later still, in this -- the third and final revision -- Woodward capped off the era with an examination of the more violent, less integrationist movements which arose after Watts, with leaders like Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver and Bobby Seale.<br />Woodward is an equal-opportunity myth-exploder.  On the one hand, he demonstrates at great length that segregation was not a mere expression of racism, but in fact a complex and corrupt outworking of many political and economic interests in the impoverished, post-Reconstruction South.  On the other hand, he also shows conclusively that segregation took time to develop:  it was not, as its supporters claimed, the way things had always been, or even the way things had come to be immediately following the war, but had actually arisen thirty and even forty years later, with the removal of Northern troops, the disintegration of Republican influence, a national &quot;taking up of the white man's burden&quot; with regard to &quot;colored&quot; peoples abroad, and increasing economic distress which allowed successive Populists and Democrats to consolidate power by limiting white exposure to the threat of competing (and competitive) blacks.  These things, combined with a series of Supreme Court rulings sanctioning segregation, produced a wicked stew which more modern readers found extremely unpalatable upon Woodward's closer examination.<br />Beyond these things, Woodward's treatment of the Jim Crow era itself, as well its demise, were and are excellent, and were especially provocative at the time of their writing.  Based on a series of lectures delivered at the University of Virginia in 1954, the book is not annotated, and even in a third edition remains quite brief; yet it is thorough and engaging, and suffers only a bit for these points.  In all, it remains not only an excellent history -- produced by one of America's finest scholars -- but also a key source document of its era, and is a very good read as well.  It continues to be vital to a proper understanding of the South, as well as the whole misbegotten concept of &quot;separate but equal.&quot;	2001-12-19

Published by The Independent Institute, one of America's premier think-tanks, That Every Man Be Armed is comprehensive in scope, and yet easily accessible to the general reader.<br />The book looks at the right to possess arms in historical context, from ancient Athens down to the present.  It gives proper attention to the Founders' generation, both before and after the Revolution, as well as detailed examination of the Fourteenth Amendment and its impact on gun rights under state and local law.  In the present day, it examines modern court holdings, as well as the rise of gun control in America (and, of particular note, how it largely arose from the desire of white racists to suppress black freedom in the decades following the Civil War).  The book is extensively documented, with close to a hundred pages of notes.<br />Halbrook establishes beyond question that the Founders' intent was to create a populace sufficiently armed to directly defend their newly won liberty, whether from foreign invasion or from overreaching government.  Not only that, he further shows that &quot;modern&quot; gun control was the norm in 18th Century Europe, that the Founders rejected that approach as fatally undermining liberty, and that the Second Amendment was to them the linchpin of all our other freedoms.  This fact is especially enlightening given the anti-gun practices of every 20th Century dictatorship, and a point few remember today.<br />And it is this above all which makes Halbrook's book so valuable.  Rather than merely approaching the issue practically -- a worthy thing to do, make no mistake -- Halbrook shows that gun ownership is the premier civil and human right, without which none of the others may safely exist.  That Every Man Be Armed is truly a must-read for all who care about human freedom.	2001-08-07

Originally titled The Strike, this &quot;very long essay masquerading as a very long novel&quot; (in the words of Morton Blackwell) chronicles the voluntary withdrawal from society of the inventive, entreprenureal class in the face of growing collectivism, and the societal collapse that results.  While Rand wrote at mid-century, readers who lived through the following fifty years will appreciate just how insightful she was, and the haunting parallels to life in the East Bloc, socialist Western Europe, and our own United States.<br />Atlas Shrugged makes the most compelling case for economic and political freedom you will likely ever read.  Few books have ever had such influence, and the book loses nothing with age.<br />Nevertheless, the reader must understand up front that Rand was more than a libertarian, and that her cultic &quot;Objectivism&quot; was far more than a philosophy.  Much more of Atlas Shrugged than not (and far more of libertarianism than not) is consistent with Christian thought; but the Christian reader must pay close attention to Rand's more seductive passages (and would do well to analyze closely John Galt's 60-page [!] speech at the end), because some of her thoughts are not what they appear to the less astute reader, and her philosophy is militantly (hostilly) atheistic.<br />Even so, this is a masterpiece of freedom, and simply must be read and appreciated.  There is nothing like it.	2001-01-06

Written by Eagle Forum President and founder Phyllis Schlaffly and Admiral Chester Ward, the thesis of the book is that key members of the Johnson Administration, in particular Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, had actively sought to weaken and impair the defenses of the United States, motivated by a belief that the cause of freedom was doomed, that the Soviet Union would surely win the Cold War, and that preparing for the eventual inevitable surrender was the best means to survival.    Regardless of the validity of that position (or of the specific choice of motives), the information used to make the case bears examination.  Schlaffly and Ward walk the reader through a panorama of Johnson Administration defense and foreign policy positions, compellingly outlining a defensive disaster.  The astute reader will recall without reminder that in 1960, the United States possessed overwhelming military superiority over its Communist opponents, and that by 1968 -- just eight years, or two presidential terms, later -- that had turned into mere parity and, in some cases, inferiority.  If nothing else, this caused extreme, needless problems for American diplomacy over the following two decades; and of course, it had the potential to cause far, far worse.    What Schlaffly and Ward show is that the cause of the change was not so much the Soviet build-up as McNamara's dismantling of America's existing force, including (but by no means limited to) the entirety of our B-47 fleet, much of our B-52 fleet, our entire fleet of supersonic (and brand new) B-58s, and our entire surface-to-air missile defense system in North America (a system, by the way, which centered on the Nike-Hercules missile, itself well capable of rudimentary ballistic missile defense).  Moreover, in the face of the aforementioned radical Soviet build-up, McNamara cancelled all strategic submarine production, the B-70 program, and all modern ICBM development; and generally did everything in his power to decrease American power beneath that of its deadly enemy.    Combined with McNamara's non-strategy in Vietnam, one could well believe the \\"Betrayers\\" thesis.    Perhaps most striking about this book, though, is not its amazing history but its astonishing currency.  The Left's arguments against missile defense in particular have not changed in the slightest particular over the past three decades, despite revolutionary advances in technology and the complete upending of the \\"old world order\\".  Pitifully enough, the arguments were as false then as now:  the Nike-Hercules and Nike-X systems -- and even the pitiful Safeguard, deployed and then scrapped by Gerald Ford in 1975 -- were fine systems technologically; and a system of \\"defense\\" based on holding millions of people hostage to nuclear terror (otherwise known as \\"Mutual Assured Destruction\\") remains hideously immoral.    In any case, The Betrayers is one of the more interesting artifacts of the Cold War, and well worth picking up.  No serious student of the period, or of current defense policy for that matter, should be without it.	2001-01-06

His The Arkansas Rockefeller is the first-hand account of a true intimate, but it is not exactly what could be called an intimate account.  While not a spin-job by any means -- Ward tells it like it is -- it reads much like the sort of biography that late 20th Century Presidential candidates have produced as campaign tracts:  aimed at the masses, short, lacking deep detail.    This is not a criticism of Ward. Ward wrote precisely the book he set out to write, and it's a good one. This is, rather, a criticism of those (myself included) who by now should have written a scholarly biography of the man who represents the greatest turning point in the political history of Arkansas.  We have all dropped the ball (though there is more information available these days than before, including my thesis, \\"Winthrop Rockefeller and the Enfranchisement of Arkansas Blacks, 1960-1966\\"), and we should all be ashamed of ourselves.    But in the meantime, we are stuck with The Arkansas Rockefeller as the only definitive biography of the great man.  It's a good, enjoyable, informative read.  It just shouldn't be alone.	2000-11-30

In telling the story, he shows how a heretofore anti-socialist America was forced by unprecedented circumstance to embrace an enormous, Washington-based big-government solution to the greatest natural catastrophe in our history, preparing the way (psychologically and otherwise) for the New Deal.  He shows how this was accomplished through the Republican (but left-wing) Herbert Hoover, who would never have become President without the flood.  Most importantly, he shows how Hoover's foolish, all-encompassing arrogance single-handedly drove the backbone of the Republican Party -- African Americans -- away from the GOP and into the arms of the segregationist, generally pro-KKK Democrats (a truly amazing feat).  It is an amazing tale indeed.<br />It holds important lessons for the future as well.  Hoover's loss of the black community is a lesson virtually unknown to modern readers (who generally assume they just drifted away under the New Deal), and holds important (and perhaps urgent) lessons for modern Democrats and Republicans alike.  <br />But on a more fundamental level, the book teaches us the power of the river, a lesson we've forgotten even in the face of some reasonably large modern floods.  Someday, possibly very soon, the levy system will likely be destroyed by the long-predicted earthquake along the New Madrid Fault:  when that day comes, the lessons of Rising Tide will be life and death matters.  Southerners in particular may ignore Rising Tide only at their peril.	2000-11-30

Packer, who wrote such essential works as &quot;Knowing God&quot; and &quot;Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God&quot;, is wonderfully qualified to bring us this special little (267 pages) book, which in the words of Westminster Seminary professor Sinclair B. Ferguson &quot;will serve equally well as an introduction to doctrine, a manual of theological terms, or a devotional study&quot; (to which one might only add that it serves as a wonderful text for a group study as well).<br />The book is divided into 4 main sections, specifically &quot;God Revealed as Creator,&quot; &quot;God Revealed as Redeemer,&quot; &quot;God Revealed as Lord of Grace,&quot; and &quot;God Revealed as Lord of Destiny.&quot; These broad divisions are then subdivided into almost 100 short (2-4 pages) chapters, with topics ranging from &quot;The Fall&quot; to &quot;The State&quot;.  Not exactly a catechism, it is excellent medicine for a catechism-starved world, where vast numbers of Christians would have enormous difficultly even defining many of the most basic terms -- not to mention the most essential doctrines -- of our faith.<br />Finally, for those unfamiliar with Packer, he is Professor of Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, and a senior editor of Christianity Today.

Goldwater	Books	4	41	48	N	N	This is the good one, before he got "old".	As everyone sadly knows, Barry Goldwater -- never a quitter -- failed to quit while he was ahead.  No one will ever know, I guess, whether he became senile in his old age; but as time progressed, the fierce champion of the Right became more and more the gadfly, happily reveling in taking abhorrent Leftist stands and letting the media use him, laughing at him all the while.    These memoirs are Goldwater before the fall, the man who gave us the modern conservative movement, still in rare form and fighting the good fight.  Published in 1979, they include not only his political thoughts but his autobiography too (the book is worth buying simply for Goldwater's recounting of the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis, which have not generally been reported as this Armed Services Committee member actually witnessed them).    Ronald Reagan said of this book that \\"everyone in America should read this frank accounting of backstage Washington by an honest man.  With No Apologies is required reading for those who want to know the inner workings of the political world.\\"  I couldn't agree more; and we may all be deeply grateful that the good Senator gave us this tome before his decline began.	2000-11-29

That the political agenda is so heavyhanded forces this reviewer to give the book only two stars; however, it must be noted that Nukespeak contains an excellent history of what it terms &quot;the selling of nuclear technology in America&quot; and it definitely added to the debate in its time.  The problem is that this excellent history is presented with such overwhelming bias that there is no way to discern what is really true from the all-encompassing propaganda.  This is not a scholarly book.  If you don't like nuclear plants, though, this is definitely a treasure-trove of talking points.	2000-11-29

Shevchenko was the highest-ranking Soviet defector ever:  he was Under Secretary-General of the United Nations at the time.  Moreover, his book was a sensational number one best seller, highly acclaimed throughout the media, and even serialized in Time Magazine.<br />Sadly, the same liberals who were praising Shevchenko didn't seem to be reading what he'd written.<br />Shevchenko wrote a real-life spy thriller, as good as any fiction available; but he also delivered an extremely timely warning.  The Soviet Union was dangerous, he said, bent on world conquest, sooner rather than later.  It was fully willing to fight a nuclear war, or a conventional war, or any kind of war that would advance its &quot;inevitable&quot; victory.  It was corrupt, its economy was failing, its leaders were desperate.  A West which was not both resolute and strong would be annihilated, sooner or later, probably sooner.<br />In 1984 and 1985, conservatives believed those things already, while liberals believed that even the mention of such was at best mindless palaver, at worst reckless war-mongering.  Five years later, as glasnost and the fall of the Soviet Union opened the &quot;evil empire's&quot; archives, it became clear that everything Shevchenko (and Reagan) had said was true (or even less severe in some cases than might have been warranted).  Yet though the Left refused to hear the message, they could not ignore the stature of the messenger, and Shevchenko had his day in the sun, as well as his reward for his service to the cause of freedom:  freedom not merely for our people, but for his own.<br />While this book may be hard to find, it is well worth the hunt.  Shevchenko's testimony is vital to a solid understanding of the latter years of the Cold War, and his story-telling is riveting.  Don't miss either.	2000-11-29

The latter, I believe, owes an incalculable debt to him. Before  1960, Meyer, who was at the time a senior editor of National Review, began  arguing that there was no inherent contradiction between the two major  streams of the Right in America, free-market principles and traditional  values.<br />        He further argued that if the conservative movement was  going to succeed, adherents of both lines of thought, natural allies on  most issues, must be fused together. Supporters of a conservative economic  policy, he taught, couldn't expect their policies to be enacted without the  backing of social-issue conservatives. And it was equally true, he  continued, that social-issue conservatives couldn't expect their policies  to be enacted unless they allied with economic conservatives.<br />          The presidential elections of 1980, 1984 and 1988, as well as the  congressional elections of 1994 and 1996, were manifestations of the wisdom  of Frank Meyer.	2000-08-05

Like Buckley, Burnham, in the  sixties and seventies particularly, provided intellectual fortification for  the conservative movement.<br />        First published in the early sixties,  Suicide of the West is a withering indictment of liberalism. Far from  serving as a bulwark against communism, liberalism, Burnham shows, is the  ideology of Western suicide, communism in its preliminary stage. Though  Soviet communism has collapsed, liberalism remains, and as long as it does,  Suicide of the West should be read by conservatives.	2000-08-05

Conservative  students of my generation, confronted with an overwhelming liberal (and  often unbearably smug) faculty, were greatly reassured by the knowledge  that Buckley could smash the arguements of anyone on the liberal  side.<br />        Though Up From Liberalism concerns itself largely with  issues that date back to the sixties, the combination of humor and  erudition Buckley uses to skewer the liberal establishment gives the book a  timeless appeal.	2000-08-05

Someone once said that pages of Burke are like  sheets of fire.<br />        During the time he lived, in the 18th century,  most political leaders were hereditary aristocrats, but Burke, like Cicero,  did not descend from generations of prominent leaders. He earned his  leadership in British politics through the power of his mind, by studying  political principles and applying them to real circumstances. A superficial  look at Burke's career might tempt one to dismiss him as a failure. Most of  the causes to which he devoted himself were not successful in his  lifetime.<br />        Prior to the American Revolution, he wrote brilliantly  on behalf of conciliation between Britain and the American colonies. He  argued for fair treatment of India by Britain. He argued for fair treatment  of the Irish by the British and for Catholic emancipation in England. In  time these positions won acceptance, but the acceptance came after Burke's  death.<br />        Fortunately, he did live long enough to see the triumph of  the greatest work of his life: his effort to awaken his country to the  fundamentally destructive but superficially attractive nature of the French  Revolution. His thorough and, I believe, inspired condemnation of the  French Revolution swept British majority opinion. To Burke, more than any  other politician of his time, goes the credit for creating the intellectual  force which saved Europe from revolutionary chaos and  dictatorship.<br />        Modern-day conservatives are also profoundly in his  debt, as his writings against the French revolution provided the  philosophical foundation for anti-communism in particular and ordered  liberty in general. Read Burke. All his writings on government and politics  are a rich ore, studded with gems of wisdom.	2000-08-05

The latter, I believe, owes an incalculable debt to him. Before  1960, Meyer, who was at the time a senior editor of National Review, began  arguing that there was no inherent contradiction between the two major  streams of the Right in America, free-market principles and traditional  values.<br />        He further argued that if the conservative movement was  going to succeed, adherents of both lines of thought, natural allies on  most issues, must be fused together. Supporters of a conservative economic  policy, he taught, couldn't expect their policies to be enacted without the  backing of social-issue conservatives. And it was equally true, he  continued, that social-issue conservatives couldn't expect their policies  to be enacted unless they allied with economic conservatives.<br />          The presidential elections of 1980, 1984 and 1988, as well as the  congressional elections of 1994 and 1996, were manifestations of the wisdom  of Frank Meyer.	2000-08-05

Conservatives of whatever variety will love this.

You may  think this is old news:  it's not.

Gresham  Machen's Christianity and Liberalism. Machen's classic was written in the  height of the battle for control over the Presbyterian Church USA (the most  prominent of the \\"mainline denominations\\"), and defines with brilliance the  battle lines between liberal (so-called) Christianity and the orthodox  faith. Moreover, it points out exactly what is at stake: the true faith, as  opposed to a perverse shadow of that faith, a shadow based on subjectivism  which elevates man's sovereignty over God's and ends in believing nothing at  all.    It is important to understand that the liberalism Machen castigates is not  political but theological (although many if not most of the liberals of the  latter camp fell also in the former, numerous prominent political liberals  -- such as three-time Democrat Presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan  -- fought alongside Machen). This theological liberalism manifests itself in  many ways, but is chiefly characterized by a rejection of Scripture as  infallibly inspired, a denial of the doctrines of the Fall and of Hell, and  a belief in man's evolutionary self-perfection (process theology, with  progress guided by an \\"enlightened\\" elite). Machen correctly asserts that  this is not merely a different approach to the Gospel, but is in fact a  different gospel: an exchange of God's sovereignty for man's, God's law-word  for man's, God's eternal, unchanging standards for man's evolving, situation  ethics. For this reason, Machen contends that liberalism and Christianity  are separate things: rival religions, permanently at war.    The one problem with this book (a fault which made good rhetorical sense at  the time, but which is somewhat misleading concerning the true nature of the  struggle) is Machen's choice of categories. Machen deals with theological  conservatives and liberals (legitimate in terms of the Bible's own dichotomy  between saved and lost), but misses the inescapable fact that there was a  third faction at work in the church (a fact which eventually resulted in his  defrocking). That third faction was the great mushy evanjellyfish middle, a  pietistic/mystical majority which was neither willing to accept the liberal  position nor fight for the conservative cause. As Machen had rightly pointed  out two years earlier in his address to incoming students at Princeton (and  again, much later, in the last two years of the struggle), these were the  Christians who said \\"'Peace, peace', when there was no peace\\", and elevated  that \\"peace\\" over truth. As in all other endeavors, \\"peace at any price\\"  resulted in defeat, and in the end, it was that great mushy middle which  delivered the PCUSA to the left (and over the cliff).    Even so, it is important to note when examining this struggle that the  conservatives largely threw the game away. I strongly recommend North's  Crossed Fingers, the only definitive history of this fight and a masterful  analysis of the tactics and mistakes of both sides.    Yet at the end of the day, you must read Machen. This book is vital for  Christians defending their churches and denominations against increasing  liberal encroachment, and indeed more so by the day. It is as groundbreaking  as it is timeless.	2000-06-27

It would make a great movie though -- which most of Turtledove's really great books would not -- and I suppose that is the point of Dreyfus' presence.<br />Insofar as this book does Alternate  History, the AH is very interesting, but the spin the book takes on it  never seems *necessary* and therefore one wonders just how plausible it is  (even though, once again, none of it is unbelievable and all of it is,  again, interesting).  Perhaps this could have been remedied had the book  really been an alternate history book.  But alas, it is not.<br />Insofar as  this book is a detective novel, it is a fine one, well done.  But no one  read this book to find a good detective story, and the detective story,  while a good mechanism to take us all over North America and see how life  has differently evolved, overwhelms the Alternate History so that you spend  a great deal of the time you're reading wishing that it would simply go  away.  Again, it would have been a good detective book; but alas, it is  not.<br />In short, this book isn't quite anything it seeks to be, except  perhaps a screenplay.  If it is meant to be just that, it will be a great  one.  But it is by no means up to Turtledove's normal quality, and unless  you are just extremely interested in the topic or have unlimited time, I  would urge you to find his many, greatly superior books instead.	2000-06-27

It  is extremely enlightening.  And while surely the book cannot help its bias,  being written by the chief protagonist of the winning side, neither can  anyone escape either its importance or its ease of reading.  Its influence  will be justly great.<br />Judge Pressler's accomplishments -- and the triumph  of truth in America's largest Protestant denomination -- are well served by  this memoir.

That the fault for that fall lies with us  really goes without saying, even though without question he shows in great  detail the ineptitude and corruption of many in the Saigon regime along  with similar in our own ranks.    Snepp shows all too clearly how the CIA  (and the US generally) failed to honor its commitments in a thousand  different ways, and undermined the RVN time and time again. In this, of  course, Kissinger would agree; and yet Snepp painfully shows that it was Kissinger's own failures at the table in Paris that lead to much of what  transpired in 1973-75.    The account of the final days is riveting, just as  it is tragic.    You do not have a complete picture of what happened in  Vietnam without this vital conclusion.	2000-06-09

Hayek shows that the only difference is the degree of benevolence of those  leading the two countries;  he also shows that, once arbitrary power is handed over, it usually cannot be regained.<br /><br />No review can do \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" adequate justice.  On the other hand, since the book is quite short, and  since it is one of those books about which it can be right said that if you  haven't read it you are not educated, I say just go and read it for  yourself.  You too will see what millions already have.	2000-06-09

Forbes lays out clear, solution-oriented plans across a host of key issues; and were they to be enacted (and all of them are capable of being enacted rapidly), they would change America for the better forever.  Forbes doesn't see color:  he just sees poor and rich; and he wants to even the playing field for everyone, not by taking from anyone, but by expanding opportunity for all.  That's a  classically American way to look at things, and Forbes has a plan to make it work again -- and better -- in the new century.  Well worth a read.	2000-06-09

Hill	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Best of Its Kind	This is the best (and shortest) refutation available of the idea that violence against abortionists is either permissible or required.  And naturally, North argues from Biblical law, and does so until he pretty much  can't be refuted.  Much needed today.	2000-06-09

His writing is okay -- if you happen to enjoy his somewhat unique style -- but gee whiz:  there's hardly a single historically plausible idea in this whole book after the  point of divergence (the British go to war over the Trent Affair).  It was  *drudgery* reading it after about 40% of the way through, because everytime  you turned around, something else was happening that would NEVER have  happened, even in an alternate world where everyone routinely did LSD.   Just pitiful.  The whole idea of alternate history is to show -- in an  entertaining way, of course -- what *could* have been.  This *never* could  have been, period.  If you know any more history than the average junior  high student, this book will tick you off.	1999-08-26

Finally, we have a fully theologically-sound, Grace-centered study bible, with notes and essays from the best scholars (Packer, Sproul,  Boice, etc.).  Everyone in my church either has one or is getting one.	1999-08-26

There has never been a better exposition of Revelation, and it  should be required reading for those interested in the End Times.  All that  said, you must understand:  this is a scholarly work.  It is accessible to  the layman, but not without effort.	1998-09-09
