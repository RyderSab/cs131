Stephanie Plum is a sort of rough around the edges Jersey version of Bridget Jones.  And the mysteries are pretty good too - and I'm really not a mystery reader. I would recomend this book as a great pool-side read - you really don't need to pay a whole lot of attention, the characters are laugh out loud funny, and there's enough sexual tension to keep it fresh.	2002-04-10
US	43623024	R8K8QOQ36NAUY	0312280947	148241573	Summerland: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	It's not a rollercoaster - it's more like a slomo carjacking	This fantastic narrative of the very privilaged life of a cluelessly happy man, his conniving wife, and their life long friends tells you from the begining that disaster has already struck.  The narrator then draggs you back to the begining of their story and takes you through their life, ever moving slowly forward to that inevitable end.  I could not put down the book in suspense as to how their lives would play out.  It was really really great - teasing and suspenseful without being overly so.	2002-04-10

The plot was good - the young writer dropping everything and going to France, his traumatic learning experiences during his teenaged years, searching for the woman that got away, his mentor who just up and disappeared, the wine bottles salvaged from the rubble of his youth that take on a sort of magic of their own, all very compelling stories.  My problem was the way the author presented the stories.  It jumped around EVERY chapter.  I got tired of jumping between decades so frequently.  Read it, but just don't buy it new.	2002-04-01

This delicate masterpiece of a novel weaves together characters taken from 'House of the Spirits' and 'Daughter of Fortune' so beautifully, it's like a litte unexpected gift. The book explores a branch of the Del Valle not previously mentioned and enlightens Allende fans as to how the Del Valles of 'House of the Spirits' got to be who they are.  It's just a beautiful, joyful homage to living and I loved every word.	2002-04-01

The story follows a young woman from early adolescence through divorce, rape, death, obesity, rejection, and ultimate rebirth.  Please, don't let me scare you off with all the horrible happenings that this book exposes, it's really quite uplifting.  The character's search for acceptance, for self-awareness, and for love is so amazing that I garuntee that those who give it a chance will walk away from it refreshed and hopeful.	2002-03-20

His year in Provence speeds by with repairs to the house, visits to the outlying countryside, visitors (welcome and otherwise), and lazy days at home.  I initially worried that I'd quickly tire of the everpreseant cast of repairmen who just can't seem to get the job done - but I was pleasantly surprised.  The tone stays light, the stories don't get tired OR predictable (as is wont to happen in many travel narratives) and the author keeps the story well on the characters and not just on house fittings and tile varieties.  As an aside, later books in the series (i.e. Toujours Provence) get a little tired.	2002-03-20

Exploring the scrapbook, the main character is able to piece together her mother's life both before her birth and during her childhood and, eventually, pull herself out of her own funk.  Frankly, I think the main character is a little whiney and very self absorbed- but the stories of Vivi and her friends in the 30s 40s and 50s are fantastic.  This book embodies the relationship that every woman wishes she had with her friends - being children, growing up, getting married, having children, growing old - they do it all with style. So grab a cigarette and a bloody mary and go sit out on the porch in your underwear with your girlfriends and read this book.	2002-03-20

First, Lady of Avalon is a prequel to Mists of Avalon, outling the creation of Avalon and the histories of the women who first brought Avalon into the mists.  Second, it's written as three separate stories, each foreshadowing the Arthur story, not one continuous story.  <br />In spite of it's differences, the book by itself is quite good all in all.  And if you really do want to learn about how Avalon came to be, this book may answer some questions that &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; raised.  I would recomend it.	2002-02-11

The hilarious, often ill fated trips of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and their copies of the guide (and their trusty towels) as they travel through space to different planets are so funny they will make you wet your pants. If you don't read ANYTHING else this year, read this. And it's NOT! just for lovers of sci-fi.  If you like Saturday Night Live skits, Monty Pithon, or just ironic humor, you will love this - I garuntee it!	2002-02-11

If you LOVED \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\", than you will very much like this one.  A whole different cast of characters embarks on a new journey through space as 3 friends from Earth find themselves trapped on the greatest and most fantastic luxury space ship ever when it lands in their back yard.  To make matters worse, the ship has a bomb on board that is counting down.  There is a planet of people who have invested their entire economy into crafting this ship, and an alien journalist on board who wants nothing more than the scoop of the millenium.  It has the same, hillarious, ironic humor that made the Guide so great and a new set of characters to keep it fresh.  It's not as great as the Guide, but it holds its own.	2002-02-11

The general idea of living like a cross between Marily Monroe and Catherine Hepburn is more than appealing, but the tips and advice dished out by the book are circa 1957.  Very unhelpful for a 27 year old in 2006!  Might I suggest \\"Swell\\" by Cynthia Rowley - it's made for the modern girl on a realistic budget.  The Bombshell Manual is just a bit of a flop.	2002-02-11
US	43623024	R2NVQMTWQDAOU5	0060932759	694565872	Daughter of Fortune	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Beautiful!	Allende, in her usual South American slightly magical Garcia-Marquez-esqe way, has written another classic.  The book combines the poetry of Allende's prose with a bitter-sweet story of an orphan left on the doorstep of a middle class English brother and sister.  The girl, Eliza, raised with the intention of being married off to a good, stable and weathy man, falls in love at 15 with a local nothing.  The story, which follows Eliza's life and love, is interwoven with each of the unique personal histories of each character.  It is pure Allende and, thus, a fantastic book.	2002-02-11

Tara Road covers the life of one generous and loving homemaker, her children, friends and the home life she builds and how that life very quickly crumbles to nothing when she is betrayed by her own husband.  The story follows her years of building up her home, the crash when the bad news comes, and her attempts to put herself back together - this time a little more independently.  The end, in my oppinion, is a little weak, but it holds up.  I very much liked it and think that compared to some of her latest work, (ie. Evening Class) it's pretty good, but it really dosen't compare to some of the earlier works Binchy put out like &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; or &quot;Firefly Summer&quot; which were absolutely wonderful.	2002-02-11

But, lemme warn you, it's not quite as good as the first few.  I think the problem was the pacing.  For some reason, the first 1/3 of the book takes place in only a day or two and spells out the most mundane details.  It's almost as if Ms. Gabaldon is giving the reader too much of what he wants - the plot is just &quot;too perfect&quot; for real life, and, therefore, boring.  Overall, the book was good - and like I said, if your an Outlander series reader, you've got to read it.	2002-02-05

Your attention is jerked between the narrator's grandmother as a girl, the narrator as a girl, and the narrator as an adult.  The book stretches too far to explore the experiences of each character, but never really gives a full picture of any of them.  And the issues that the narrator *struggles* over are exagerated to the point of silliness:  she's broken up with her husband (several years ago), her husband's new life, her daughter is having a baby, she is thinking of having an affair with an older man, her grandmother as a girl dealing with her mother's death, the grandmother's stay in a sanitorium, et cetera, et cetera...

She purchases not just a few things on a whim - but EVERYTHING!  So well written is the book, though, that the reader can really relate.

This is a book for someone who LIKES TO COOK and LIKES TO EAT.  The recipies are inspired.  They cut out a lot of fat but absolutely maintain flavour.  If you're afraid of the kitchen, I would not recomend it for you.  This is not baked chicken with steamed squash, this is broiled pears and stilton over field greens with it's own fabulous dressing.

The cook book is simply an extention of the cafe - the recipies are easy to follow, discriptive, and taste just like the restaurant.
