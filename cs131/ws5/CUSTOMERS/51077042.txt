Being that I've had a long interest with both Alaska and bears, I stopped my channel surfing to watch the show.  I was therefore treated to the stupifying antics of one Timothy Treadwell of Malibu!  As I sat there with my mouth agape staring in disbelief at the bizarre, reckless behavior of this effeminate-sounding wanna-be Grizzly Adams, I was saying to myself: \\"This man is nuts!  And he's going to get himself killed!\\"  Thus, when the news came in October 2003 that Treadwell had indeed been killed by a bear, it sparked an interest to learn more about this man and the events of his death.  Nick Jans' book, \\"The Grizzly Maze,\\" is an entertaining and satisfying reading experience for those interested in Mr. Treadwell. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, Jans is a gifted writer and his laid-back, folksy style is a pleasure to read.  I finished this book in two days- it's so well written that it makes an already interesting topic even more fascinating. <br /> <br />Jans attempts to be has evenhanded as possible with his controversial subject.  To many people, especially most Alaskans, Treadwell was a benighted greenie interloper who got his ecological comeuppance for trying to make \\"nicey-nice\\" with the bears.  To others, Treadwell was a heroic eco-warrior who lived a full passionate life that mundane souls can only dream about.  Jans finds truths in both of those viewpoints. <br /> <br />Jans finds a lot about Treadwell to admire and, in fact, sees a lot similarities between himself and Timothy.  He clearly admires Treadwell's passion, his drive, his refusal to settle, and, above all, his sheer guts!  He also discovers through interviews with Treadwell's few Alaskan friends that he was not as naive about bears as his public persona let on.  According to his friends, Treadwell had developed a real expertise in recognizing bear behavior.  The fact that he was able to live among them for thirteen years speaks volumes that the man knew what he was doing.  He was also fully aware that some bears were very dangerous and took precautions to avoid confrontations.  Finally, Treadwell's passion was undeniable- thirteen years spent soaking wet, bug-bitten in some of the toughest wilderness on planet shows a man driven by a lot more than a lust for publicity. <br /> <br />However, Jans' book provides plenty of ammunition for those who did not hold a high opinion of Mr. Treadwell.  In some ways, Treadwell had the mentality of a con artist.  He had no qualms of lying to people about his background- this native NYer with his family still alive and well on Long Island had no problem telling people he was a British orphan or from Australia.  This leads to Treadwell's most controversial claim that he was defending endangered bears from hordes of ruthless poachers.  It was this claim that still infuriates Alaskans and the National Park Service.  And it is this claim that his supporters still fervently believe.  Jans shows that the facts demonstrate that Treadwell was either lying or delusional.  The bears he was allegedly protecting were in not endangered in anyway and that poaching was non-existant in the areas he frequented.  Not even Treadwell's few Alaskan friends bought his stories about poachers.  To Jans, the only people who bought Treadwell's poaching stories were well-meaning, but gullible greenies in the lower 48. <br /> <br />So if Treadwell was not providing protection to the bears then what was he doing?  According to Jans, Treadwell simply just wanted to be friends with the bears.  However, that leads to the question to what purpose would that lead?  In the end, it leads to death of the bears- habituating them to humans makes them either dangerous or vulnerable.  And that led to what happened during a rainstorm on October 5, 2003.  Jans' model for what happened isvery plausible based on the known facts.  Further, the grisly details of the aftermath are not for the faint of heart- descriptions of the remains of the bodies and the contents of a bear's stomach are described. <br /> <br />Jans' book is a terrific entry to what seems to be a growing cult of interest in the life and death of Timothy Treadwell which has already seen numerous articles, two books, and two documentary films.	2005-08-20

Yes, Francis Parkman's use of 19th century venacular and grammar can be a little offputting to a 21st century reader.  Also, his prudish Victorian attitudes about what is appropriate to be written can come across as silly.  However, Parkman wrote history with the skill of a novelist.  His narrative histories are among the best written works in all of American literature.<br />As others have noted, these books are not &quot;politically correct&quot; in their description of the American Indian.  Francis Parkman did write with an agenda.  In the late 19th century, Parkman was offended by what he saw as the popular romanticism of the American Indian.  (A trend that has continued to this day with the American Indian routinely being presented as a &quot;New Age Eagle scout with a bent for ecology&quot; in both our popular culture and even in our schools.)  Thus, Parkman attempted to write what he saw as the &quot;historical&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; portrayal of the American Indian- one that could be ruthless, barbaric, and extremely cruel and he backed up his opinion with numerous historical examples.<br />Parkman saw himself as a neutral narrator- a &quot;I'm just writing down the facts&quot; type of historian.  And he does describe examples of European barbarism and their genocidal strategies against the natives to go along side of his &quot;Injun massacre&quot; portrayal of the American Indian.  Yet Parkman wrote with obvious biases and his description of the American Indian tribes is too simplistic.  Partly, this is because of Parkman's own racial prejudices, but also it is because of his limitations as a historian.  Parkman's history is just a straight narrative with almost no analysis.<br />For instance, Parkman describes the Iroquois Confederacy's destruction of the Hurons in the late 1640's in terrific detail, but he doesn't really explain why the Iroquois were so determined to crush the Hurons.  To Parkman, the answer was simple the Iroquois were primitive savages, who reveled in large scale murder and destruction, so there is no reason to analyze why they attacked and destroyed an ancient enemy.  Yet modern research, using the same sources Parkman had access too, has shown that there were very logical reasons why the Hurons were targetted for destruction by the Iroquois- the Hurons because of their location near the entrance of the Ottawa River controlled the beaver trade from the upper Great Lakes and the Iroquois wanted that plum for themselves because in order to survive in the world of the Europeans tribes needed something to bargain with and beaver pelts were that something.  Parkman because of his prejudices just could not see Indian tribes being that rational in their decisions to go to war.<br />Time has definitely exposed Parkman's limitations as a historian.  Yet his two volume history of England and France in North America still remains extremely readable and entertaining- his description of entering an Algonquin wigwam is a perfect example of his talent as a master narrator.<br />[Also, it's pretty sad to see Robert Gould Shaw, a kinsman of Parkman's and to whom the first book of this history was dedicated too, being referred to as &quot;the guy&quot; who Matthew Broderick played in the movie &quot;Glory.&quot;]	2004-06-20

I made a big mistake of reading Michael Curtis Ford's &quot;Gods and Legions&quot; immediatly after I had just reread Wallace Breem's 1970 novel &quot;Eagle in the Snow.&quot;  As a result, I had the experience of making the sharp transition from reading superior historical fiction to reading mediocre/poor historical fiction.  &quot;Eagle in the Snow,&quot; although dry at times, really attempts to capture the feel of the later Roman Empire as it rots internally while at the same time it is being assailed externally.  As I read &quot;Gods and Legions&quot; I never got the feeling that the Roman Empire was a sick and dying entity.  In fact, &quot;Gods and Legions&quot; presents the picture of a robust empire only in need of an exceptionally gifted leader to cure its ailments.<br />The main character of &quot;Gods and Legions,&quot; Julian, a scholar who becomes caesar of the west and then emperor, is presented as such an exceptional leader.  Julian is seemingly able to cure the military, financial, and civic problems of the Empire simply by his intelligence, charm, and hard work.  He summons armies of tens of thousands of men seemingly by snapping his fingers.  He turns himself into a great general just by study.  He stops corruption and gets the government coffers filled by installing fair tax codes.  Basically, what we have here is &quot;great man&quot; history taken to an illogical extreme.  I guess it's a matter of personal taste, but I like my historical fiction to emphasize the history and not the fiction.<br />Anacronisms abound.  The barbarians are presented as looking like they stepped out of the World Wrestling Federation.  One of even them carries around a harpoon?  Ford uses the modern names for the cities of 4th century Europe instead of their Roman names.  War elephants are shown ripping soldiers apart with their mouths.  I just never got a feel for period being presented, but instead got pop historical fiction filled with cliches and pumped up descriptions of over-the-top violence. <br />Also, the characters lack any depth.  Julian is presented as an enthusiastic, idealist who is corrupted by power.  Yawn!  The narrator, Caesarius the physician, is nothing more than a cipher.  Sallustias is the honorable soldier who seemingly knows everything about training soldiers and governing provinces.  Basically, he's just another cardboard cut-out in a novel full of them.  Then there are the plot twists which are so obviously figured out that it is insulting to your intelligence.  Who was really responsible for the death of that baby?  Who wrote that document urging rebellion among the Gallic soldiers?  I hope Ford did not expect anyone to be surprised by the answers to those questions.<br />&quot;Gods and Legions&quot; fails to capture the feel of a period and it also fails to introduce characters of any interest or depth.  Thus, it is an example of what historical fiction should not be.	2004-06-19

It is quite telling that this reprinting of Wallace Breem's 1970 novel &quot;Eagle in the Snow&quot; has a forward by Steven Pressfield, author of the best selling novel, &quot;Gates of Fire.&quot;  Because upon reading &quot;Eagle in the Snow,&quot; it's very evident that this is where Pressfield got the idea of his novel being narrated by the sole survivor of a lost battle retelling his story for an audience.  It is little wonder that Pressfield is so praiseworthy in the forward because &quot;borrowing&quot; the narrative format from &quot;Eagle in the Snow&quot; helped make him a very wealthy man.<br />Breem has an eye for detail in some matters, but not in others. For instance, he gives few details on how these people looked like.  How are these barbarians dressed and what do they use for armor and weapons?  Do these early 5th century Roman legionnaires look anything like the 1st century Legionnaires shown on the cover of the book?  (The cover of this reprint was obviously designed to attract fans of the movie &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  It also helps that the main character is a Roman general named &quot;Maximus.&quot;  Did &quot;Gladiator's&quot; screenplay writers read this book?&quot;)  I would have really appreciated more detail on arms and equipment, but Breem gives very little.  Also, I was curious why Breem didn't even bother giving a name to one of the few female characters in the story- she's just &quot;Rando's daughter&quot; or &quot;the girl.&quot;  <br />Where Breem does give detail is on the personalities of various characters- ruthless, opportunistic barbarian kings; cowardly, venal civilian authorities; and proud, professional Roman soldiers.  (Breem, a former British Army officer, does not hide his sympathies.)<br />Breem also goes into great detail on the tactical and operational situation facing his Roman general.  With too few troops, Maximus must defend a 50 mile stretch of the Rhine River against a threatened mass migration of Germanic barbarians.  How Maximus keeps these tribes ignorant as to his weakness through subterfuge and diplomacy while at the same time maximizing his own tactical abilities to keep them off-balance is the crux of the novel.  Meanwhile, he must also combat apathetic and pessimistic civilian authorities for his supplies and, above all, reinforcements.  It is a very tenuous situation, but Maximus does have one huge ally- the Rhine River, deep and wide, it is an almost impregnable, naturally-made barrier to invasion.  But, if the upcoming winter is exceptionally cold then the Rhine could become his greatest enemy....<br />Overall, if one can stick through the rather weak beginning then &quot;Eagle in the Snow&quot; becomes a very engrossing read.  How Maximus deals with the challeges of a very difficult military situation is gripping.	2004-05-31

Laura Ingalls Wilder's \\"Farmer Boy\\" is a departure from the rest of the famed \\"Little House\\" books in that it does not relate the story of her own family's hardscrabble existence on the western frontier, but instead tells the story of her husband's boyhood on his family's prosperous farm in upstate New York.  Thus, it introduces readers to an entirely new family, the Wilders, and the Ingalls family is not even mentioned.  However, this is one of the best books of the \\"Little House\\" series.<br />\\"Farmer Boy\\" details a year or so in the life of 9 yr old Almanzo Wilder.  A good deal of this book is spent showing that life on a farm in the 1860's, even for a well-to-do family living in a civilized part of the country, still meant never-ending, hard, physical labor.  Young Almanzo and his siblings spend their lives working on one chore after another- the work changing as the seasons change.  Undoubtedly, modern children will read this book and be thankful that they don't live in a time where sleeping in past 5 AM was considered odd and children were expected to be seen (at work) and not heard.<br />In addition to describing day to day life on a farm, Mrs. Wilder also details the family relationships between the Wilders.  Almanzo's parents are shown as loving, but, in contrast to Pa and Ma Ingalls, they come across as a little more stern and authoritarian with their children.  For example, James Wilder, Almanzo's father, is always called \\"Father\\" never \\"Pa.\\"<br />Almanzo's relations with his three siblings are also described.  (Almanzo actually had five siblings, but oldest sister, Laura, and younger brother, Perley, were left out of the book.)  Almanzo looks up to his 13 yr old brother, Royal.  Ten yr old sister Alice is shown as being very spunky and loveable and was obviously Almanzo's favorite sib.  (Alice, who was a very pretty girl, died at a fairly young age and this book is her younger brother's tribute to her.)  And finally there is Eliza Jane, age 12, who comes across as every younger brother's nightmare of a bossy older sister.  It's obvious that Laura Ingalls Wilder did not care much for her sister-in-law Eliza Jane because she portrayed her pretty badly in her books.  However, one of the great moments of \\"Farmer Boy\\" involves Eliza Jane showing in her own way how much she truly loved her younger brother. The wonderful descriptions of familial relationships in the \\"Little House\\" books are one of the big reasons why this series is so beloved.<br />\\"Farmer Boy\\" exudes all the hallmarks of a great \\"Little House\\" book- the wonderfully detailed depiction of life on a farm, the loving but still realistic portrayal of family life, and it also exudes a warm-hearted sentiment for an era long gone.  Yet, \\"Farmer Boy\\" shows some of the darker elements of mid-19th century life.  An attempted burglary is a subject of one chapter and the book opens with a pretty scary depiction of an 1860's schoolhouse.  The \\"Little House\\" books often present a fairly rosy picture of the one-room schoolhouse, yet \\"Farmer Boy\\" shows a darker side.  In this book, the teenage sons of farmers are shown coming to school just to bust it up and pummel any teacher who gets in their way.<br />Finally, as an Irish-American, I've always been amused by the unconcious bigotry towards Irish immigrants found in the \\"Little House\\" books.  The few Irish characters in these books are either shown as fall-down drunks or as fools- read the story about cutting-ice in \\"Farmer Boy\\" to see an example.

US	51077042	RUH4720YP9NPQ	0752425935	146255714	Flodden (Revealing History)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Well written account of a Scottish disaster.	If the battle of Bannockburn represents Scotland's greatest victory against the English then Flodden represents its worst defeat.  On September 9, 1513, a Scottish army under the command of their king, James IV, was utterly crushed by an English army under the command of the Earl of Surrey.  In the appalling close quarter combat, King James, most of the Scottish nobility, and maybe up to 8,000 Scottish solders were slain.  With James IV dead, his infant son became king which brought all the internal struggles and internecine violence that accompanies a kingdom run by regents.  Scotland, which before the battle had been emerging as a real player in European politics, never recovered from this catastrophe.<br />The most interesting facet of author Niall Barr's book is that the Scot's seemingly had all the advantages.  The army James IV led over the English border in 1513 was probably the largest (btw 30-40,000 men) and the best equipped (it had a large train of siege artillery and most of its men were armed with 18ft long pikes- the weapon which had helped make Swiss armies almost invincible on continental battlefields) that Scotland had ever fielded.  The Scots had also adopted Swiss tactics- phalanx-like pike formations attacking in echelon.  The English army that faced them was smaller in size (around 26,000 men), had only light field guns, and most of its men were armed with weapons that were considered obsolescent in the early 16th century, the bill and the longbow.  James was also able to draw the English army into battle on ground of his own choosing- a hill upon which his pikemen could charge down and literally overrun their opponents.  Thus, the Scots had advantages in numbers, artillery, position, and were using the most modern weapons and tactics of the day.  Yet, it was the Scots who were slaughtered.  How did this happen?<br />Barr believes that from a strategic and operational standpoint James IV did everything right.  This is contrary to Scottish tradition which portrays James as a frivolous and unrealistic man who blundered his country into war and then botched the campaign.  Barr discounts these judgements and makes a strong case that James was actually very level-headed in invading England in 1513 (at the time the English king, Henry VIII, was in France with his best troops) and that he also made good decisions on the campaign.  However, Barr believes the Scottish defeat at Flodden was because of poor tactical theory.  The Scots quite simply were carrying the wrong sort of weapons and fighting with the wrong sort of tactics.<br />Barr spends an entire chapter focusing on the Swiss military system of the early 16th century and explains why it was the envy of Europe.  Thus, he lays the groundwork to show why that system failed the Scots so badly at Flodden.  Swiss armies were renowned for their discipline, training, and high morale which enabled their pike formations to retain their cohesion.  This cohesion was vital to their success.  The Scottish army at Flodden was a feudal levy with minimal training, little discipline, and brittle morale.  When, because of a lack of training, the Scottish pike formations lost their cohesion the English were able to rush in among them.  In close quarters, a Scot armed with an 18ft long pike was at a huge disadvantage against Englishman carrying an 8ft bill.  Even then disaster could have been averted if the Scots had copied the Swiss combined arms approach to combat.  The Swiss did not entirely rely on pikemen, but instead had sizeable formations of halberdiers, crossbowmen, and handgunners to break-up enemy formations and engage in close quarter combat.  But before Flodden, the Scots had decided to live (and thus die) with the pike alone.<br />Barr's analysis and detail is fascinating.  He dedicates an entire chapter to describing the first artillery duel in British military history which the English won and caused the Scots to abandon their strong position.  He also explainswhy the Scottish nobility suffered such horrendous losses- a rarity even for a late medieval battle.  Overall, this an extremely well-written account of a battle that is virtually unknown outside the U.K which is surprising considering its size and the devastating effect on the loser.	2004-04-07

He twisted his being allowed to get within almost touching distance of incredibly tolerant wild animals into some sort of &quot;gift.&quot;  Writing this book and filming his exploits he grew into a semi-celebrity as a &quot;grizzly bear whisperer,&quot; which made his almost inevitable death by one of these animals into a farce.<br />Treadwell is now the poster boy of the clueless environmental activist- a person so blinded by his own selfishness that he ignored the danger to not only himself, but also to the animals.  It has been standard policy since the 60's that the best situation for both bears and humans is for both to give each other a wide berth.  That means for humans to keep their distance and for bears to retain their natural fear of humans.  It's the best situation for best species.  Yet here came Tim Treadwell of Malibu, a recovering drug addict with no specialized training or education, who decided for his own selfish purposes that he had to get as close to the bears as possible.  That he was able to survive for ten summers intruding on the personal space of sows with cubs and feeding bears speaks more of the tolerance of these animals than Treadwell's alleged &quot;gift.&quot;<br />Treadwell blithely ignored repeated warnings from park rangers and wildlife officials that he was modeling unsafe behavior and endangering not only himself but the bears and other people.  He lived by a policy of what is good for the goose is not good enough for the gander.  He would tell others not to do what he was doing, but then would film himself doing incredibly foolish stunts with some extremely dangerous predators.  He justified his actions by saying he was protecting the bears from poachers- an absolutely absurd claim because Alaskan officials state the area that Treadwell practiced his alleged protection skills never had a poaching problem.<br />Treadwell's death is a warning to touchy-feely, feel-gooders everywhere.  Getting closeto these impressive animals made Treadwell feel good about himself.  It was this selfish impulse that led to the deaths of himself, his girlfriend, and two bears.  He is the first person on record to be killed by bear in Katmai National Park and that is as big an indictment of Treadwell's activities as any.  People and bears were able to co-exist in Katmai without much trouble until this self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; showed up, violated every rule of how to act in bear country, and then publicized his flaunting of common sense.  A true charlatan if there ever was one!	2004-03-28
US	51077042	R1VM2UEZL7UEG6	0380709252	116234035	Mitch and Amy	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Two versions	There are actually two versions of this book- an newer one with illustrations by Alan Tiegreen, who has been doing the illustrations for Beverly Cleary's books since the 70's, and the original, which had illustrations by George Porter.  I guess Mr. Porter was the intermediate link between Tiegreen and Louis Darling, the illustrator of Mrs. Cleary's books in the 50's and early 60's.  It's a matter of personal taste over which illustrations are better.  I grew up reading the version with Mr. Porter's illustrations, which depicts the characters as definitely children of the 1960's.  On the other hand, Mr. Tiegreen's depictions of Beverly Cleary's characters are less realistic looking, but because of their rather cartoony appearance are not as susceptible to looking as dated as those by Porter and Darling.<br />Beverly Cleary always took experiences from her own life to include in her books, but \\"Mitch & Amy\\" is probably the most personal of her fictional books.  She, herself, was the mother of boy-girl twins and actually lived in the San Franisco setting of the book.  Maybe because it was about two subjects so close to her real life, her twins and her adopted hometown, that she never did a follow-up story.  Thus, \\"Mitch & Amy\\" is one of Mrs. Cleary's very few \\"stand-alone\\" books.<br />It's the story of a twin sister and brother, Amy and Mitchell, who live in San Francisco.  Despite their shared birthday, they are seemingly exact opposites who constantly squabble with one another.  However, deep-down there is a very strong bond between the two of them and each one truly understands the other.  Sometimes they forget that bond.  Yet when a bully targets each twin individually, the two of them bond together to help each other overcome this mutual menace.<br />This is a typical Cleary novel- told with her usual sense of humor and wonderful ability to capture what really matters to children.  Regardless of whether the illustrations show Porter's 60's era children with theirflat-top haircuts and short pants or Tiegreen's pug-nosed characters, most kids will probably enjoy reading about these two regular kids who just happen to be twins.	2004-03-28

It's a quick read and I was able to finish it in day.  It kept me turning the page and interested to find out what would happen next.  That pretty much fills my criterion of an entertaining read and that's all I expected from it.  I didn't start reading it with the belief that it would rival Pressfield's &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; or Chiavetone's &quot;A Road We Do Not Know&quot; as a modern classic of military historical fiction and it most certainly did not.<br />&quot;Under the Eagle&quot; is an attempt to give the reader a &quot;boots on the ground&quot; view of the Roman army in the 1st Century AD by following the lives and adventures of two junior officers in the 2nd Legion- a veteran, battle-hardened centurion, Macro, and a fresh-faced, kid recruit, Cato, who because of connections is promoted to Macro's optio or second-in-command.  It's a neat premise- what was it like to live and fight in a Roman Legion.  However, Scarrow was only partly successful in creating this premise into a compelling work of historical fiction.<br />Scarrow obviously did some heavy historical research to capture the locations and political atmosphere of the era.  However, one also gets the idea that Scarrow has watched too many war movies and unfortunately fell back on those memories to fill his novel with cliches and anachronistic dialogue.  The recruit training parts are something out of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and the relationship between Macro/Cato is similar to the one between John Wayne and John Agar had in &quot;The Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;- a soft, rich kid grows up and becomes a leader under the tutelage of a battle-hardened vet.  The most jarring fault of Scarrow is having his Roman soldiers talk just like modern-day Brits.  It's extremely silly when you come across this dialogue and really helps ruin the historical atmosphere.  (In my life I have taken five years of Latin and I never learned the Latin equivilents of &quot;wanker,&quot; &quot;bloody,&quot; or &quot;bugger.&quot;)<br />Also, Scarrow seems to get bored with describing the day to day lives of 1st century legionnaires and thus moves the plot into one of political intrigue.  It would have been nice to get a more detailed look at life in a Roman century- like what kind of men made up the Roman army.  However, with a few weakly drawn exceptions, the men of the 6th Century, 4th Cohort are mostly nameless figures whose only purpose is to fill out the casuality rolls.<br />The faults of this novel are glaring, but I still finished it in a day.  So there is definetely something here that is worth checking out if you like historical fiction.  I thought Scarrow did a great job of introducing characters and plot strings that really make one want to continue reading.  I was pulled into this novel early on.

They were the type of friends who walked to and from school everyday and spent most of their free time together.  However, in middle school Scott, who is smart, good looking, and athletic, finds himself being invited to hangout with the popular boys.  At first, David also hangs out with the popular kids, but his acceptance into this group is only due to his association with Scott.  David doesn't particularly like Scott's new friends and he knows that they are just barely tolerating him.  But even worse is that David gets the feeling that Scott, his best friend, is embarrassed by David's presence when hanging out with these \\"cool\\" kids.<br />David tries to fit in and even goes along with a vicious prank on an elderly woman even though he knows it was wrong.  (During the prank, the woman puts a \\"curse\\" at David.)  However, David's attempts to fit in fail and gradually he gets the idea that his friendship with Scott is over.  To emphasize that they are no longer friends, Scott with his new buddies decide to make David's school life miserable.  David finds himself alone and seemingly cursed in the unfriendly world of middle school.<br />Yet David makes new friends.  There is Larry, an odd guy, who constantly wears blue sunglasses, and claims to have lived all over the world.  And there is Maureen (better known as Mo) a petite girl with short hair and \\"a-don't-mess-with-me\\" demeanor.  And then there is \\"Ms. Williams\\"- the girl David likes and has given hints that she likes him too. David should be happy.  He has new friends and he is on the verge of asking Ms. Williams out.  However, Scott and his buddies not only continue to tease David, but also start picking on his new friends and his younger brother.  Even worse is that David thinks that the \\"curse\\" put upon him, which he believes is causing to do a lot of dumb, clumsy, and obnoxious stuff, is ruining his chances with Ms. Williams.  So David must find a way to beat the curse and in doing so he must also confront the bullies as well as his own guilt and fears.<br />Louis Sachar's depiction of middle school life certainly rings true in many aspects.  (I had a close grade school friend who abandoned me for the popular crowd in junior high.)  Also, Sachar recognizes that sometimes fighting back is the only thing that will make a middle school bully back off.  (I tried for months to ignore the bullies who had targetted me.  However, that only encouraged wanna-be kids to see me as an easy way to increase their social standing.  It was only after I finally stood up and I clobbered a wanna-be that most of the teasing ended.)  Sachar's depiction of a middle school brawl is graphic and very realistic.<br />Also realistic is the language used by the characters.  However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that this sort of language is inappropriate for the age group this book is marketed for.  Yes, I used this sort of language when I was 12, but I don't think the use of it should be encouraged in a book for kids 9-12.  It's also unneccessary.  I think there are some good lessons to be learned from this book such as moral responsibility and standing up for yourself and your friends, but the inclusion of some very harsh language will make teachers and school librarians less likely to recommend it to their students.	2003-10-16

David Glantz has achieved a reputation as a foremost scholar on the Soviet Red Army and its operations during World War II.  He has achieved this reputation because of his meticulous research of the once unreachable Soviet archives and the use of his findings in those archives to write a number of books on the famous (and not so famous) campaigns of the Eastern Front.  Glantz's heavy use of Soviet research materials to write his books results in their emphasizing the Soviet viewpoint.  Thus, his books often contrast greatly with the East Front works of other western historians who often based their research almost entirely on the much more accessible German sources, which Glantz believes are as tainted by self-service and selective memory as the official Soviet account were by communist propaganda.  By delving into the Soviet archives and developing a picture of how the Soviets really viewed \\"The Great Patriotic War,\\" Glantz has been able to present a much clearer view of that struggle than was possible before the fall of the USSR.  <br />Glantz is a thorough researcher and his books often show that a lot of what we knew about the East Front just wasn't true because much of it was tainted by German apologia and Soviet propaganda.  By cutting through the myths, Glantz has made his mark as one of the preeminent historians on the East Front.  However, unfortunately, he is a dull, dull, DULL writer!<br />\\"The Battle of Leningrad\\" has all of Glantz's trademarks: detailed research, a straight narrative of the campaign told mainly from the Soviet viewpoint, and a mindnumbing writing style.  I don't consider myself a either a lightweight military history buff or someone who can't handle dry text, but \\"The Battle of Leningrad\\" with its page after page of unit number designations and Russian place names just made my eyes glaze over everytime I started to read it.  Yes, I know campaign studies deal with unit designations and geographic features, but \\"The Battle of Leningrad\\" seems to be nothing but those elements related in a colorless prose.  There is little about the personalities of the commanders, the differences in equipment, and although Glantz does draw upon some first hand accounts of those involved in the action he just isn't very good at blending those into the narrative.<br />I've enjoyed some of Glantz's books such as his single volume history of the Eastern Front, \\"When Titans Clashed,\\" and his \\"The Battle of Kursk.\\"  However, those books were co-written by Jonathan House.  I don't know exactly how House contributes to these joint efforts, but I have a suspicion that he is a much more polished writer than Glantz and thus he is the reason why those books are much more readable than the ones written just by Glantz himself.<br />If you're a specialist on the Leningrad campaign then \\"The Battle of Leningrad\\" will be an invaluable reference tool.  However, if you're looking for a good read on an important campaign of WW II then either skip this book or have plenty of caffeine at hand when trying to tackle it.	2003-10-04

Author Paul Gallico writes his novella, \\"Miracle in the Wilderness: A Christmas Story of Colonial America\\" as if recalling a story his great-grandmother told him on a Christmas Eve night when he was a little boy. Gallico lets his great-grandmother's tale transport the reader from her cozy, Christmas tree decorated and scented parlor to a rugged, snow-covered trail in the vast mid-18th century wilderness of upstate New York.<br />The great-grandmother's story is set on a Christmas Eve during the French and Indian War. On that day, Algonquin Indians, allied with the French, attacked the isolated frontier home of Jasper Adams. After brutally subduing Jasper and his wife, Dorcas, the Indians burn the cabin and march the Adamses and their infant son, Asher, into the surrounding wilderness as captives. Being hotly pursued by British soldiers bent on rescue or revenge, the Algonquin leader has to make a decision whether to risk the lives of his men by keeping the slow moving captives alive or kill them in order to move more swiftly through night forest. The leader is just about to announce his decision when his party come across three deer: a buck, a doe, and a fawn kneeling toward the east in the middle of moonlit glade. Jasper Adams is shocked out of his pain and despair by the sight of the deer which reminds him that on this night the infant Jesus was born. He falls to his knees in homage and is quickly joined there by his wife, who holds their infant son. The Algonquins are bewildered by the unafraid deer and also by their captives' seeming understanding of this strange sight. Their leader, a very spiritual man, demands that Jasper tell him what this all means. Jasper complies and starts to describe the first Christmas to his captors and what this night means to all people and the creatures that walk upon the earth. What follows is the true miracle in the wilderness.<br />This is wonderfully written story of humankind's enduring faith. It's fairly short and can be readin one sitting (as I do every Christmas Eve.)<br />This novella was also turned into a made-for-TV movie about ten years ago by TNT.  However, the creators of the movie butchered this wonderful story by changing the setting from the French and Indian War to the 19th century West and then adding all sorts of unneccessary subplots.	2002-12-04

However, as I read the first few chapters I was thinking to myself, \\"Boy, the Newbery standards weren't very high back then.\\"  My chief problem was that it was written in a very archaic and verbose style.  I understand that the author was trying to recreate a feeling of 17th century language for his readers, but any child under the age of 12 is going to get frustrated and I doubt many children over age 12 will enjoy wading through its difficult prose either.  Also, this is a strange childrens book in that the main character is not a child, but a 19 yr old man with an eye for comely barmaids.<br />However, if one can get through the rather awkward writing style and the cursory introductions to key characters, \\"The Dark Frigate\\" becomes a real page turner when the pirates enter the story and remains one until the last couple of chapters when the author tries to wrap everything up a little too quickly.  The chapters dealing with the pirates, though, make for an extremely entertaining and exciting tale.  It's those chapters that made me understand why this book won the Newbery.<br />Although, written for children, \\"The Dark Frigate\\" is a rather grown-up book with murders being described in grisly detail, implied torture, hangings, and female characters who aren't exactly chaste maidens.  I guess children in the 20's weren't handled with kid gloves when it came to describing the seedier elements of life.	2002-10-23

George Armstrong Custer is one of America's most famous soldiers, but his fame today is derived almost totally from the defeat that cost him his life.  Today, Custer is the poster boy for hopeless causes- the perennial loser.  However, one of the big reasons why the defeat at Little Big Horn was such a shock to Americans in 1876 was because before that battle Custer's name had been synonymous with victory.  The thesis of Gregory Urwin's book, \\"Custer Victorious,\\" is to illustrate by using Custer's Civil War career that he was far from the incompetent, glory hunter of current popular opinion.  Instead Urwin sets out to show that GA Custer was one of the best brigade and division commanders in the Union Army.<br />Urwin's task is not too difficult.  GA Custer's Civil War career was pretty spectacular.  Promoted from a staff position to the command of a cavarly brigade on the eve of the battle of Gettysburg, Custer would prove to be an outstanding combat commander in virtually every engagement his unit fought in.  Eventually, his profiency as a brigade commander would earn him the command of the 3rd Cavarly Division and a promotion to brevet major general at the age of 25.<br />Custer's critics like to point out that Custer's units suffered high casualties and that his successes were more a result of dumb luck than any tactical ability, Urwin ably destroys these misconceptions.  It is true that Custer's men suffered heavy casualties, but that was unfortunately the cost of victory on Civil War battlefields.  Also Custer never got the reputation for being careless with the lives of his men.  His willingness to share in any danger that his men faced and the victories and prestige his units garnered under his command created admiration rather than resentment among his men.  To prove this Urwin provides quotes from admiring subordinates and constantly refers to the 3rd Division as the \\"Red Tie boys\\" to remind the reader that many men in that unit wore red ties around theirnecks in tribute to the one worn by their long-haired commander.  Urwin also utterly destroys the idea that Custer was a tactical buffoon who lucked into victories with flashy cavalry charges.  Urwin shows that Custer used a mixture of dismounted and mounted tactics to overcome his opponents.  He also shows that Custer had a good eye for terrain and keen sense when to launch a charge, which he used to great advantage during the later campaigns of the Civil War.<br />Urwin does make a very convincing case that GA Custer was an outstanding combat commander.  His use of primary sources to build his case is very thorough.  However, Urwin undoes alot of his work by constant cheerleading.  Urwin's Custer is too perfect.  Custer did make mistakes, but Urwin either dismisses them or just glances over them.  The entire book is written in this annoying \\"rah-rah\\" cheerleader style.  Urwin's adoration of Custer is just too much and brings down the entire academic tone of the book.  In his forward, Urwin makes a statement about how as a liberal democrat he does not worship military types, but then the rest of the text makes that statement absurb because it borders on almost idol worship.<br />\\"Custer Victorious'\\" research is impressive and because of that it almost overcomes its almost hagiographic tone to build a pretty solid case that Custer was an exceptional combat leader.  However, its constant cheerleading will make some very skeptical of its assertions.	2002-08-17

It's not hard to figure out why books by academic historians are rarely read other than by their professional colleagues and students.  It is because most academic historians are better researchers than writers, and besides their books are written for the purpose of historical analysis not dramatic narrative.  Thus, the vast majority of history books purchased by the general public are by written by amateur historians.  The few professional historians who have had great success selling to their books to the public, such as Stephen Ambrose, are often derided as hacks and/or sell-outs in the world of academic historians.<br />Thus, to write a scholarly work which will appeal to the general reader is the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of academic historical writing.  John Demos, a highly respected historian, attempted to reach for that &quot;grail&quot; with his book &quot;The Unredeemed Captive.&quot; The unredeemed captive of Demos' book is Eunice Williams, the daughter of a Puritan minister, who, along with her family, was captured by Catholic Mohawks, allied to the French, in 1703.  Eventually, Eunice's father and her surviving siblings would be ransomed back to the English, but little Eunice would remain with the Mohawks and all efforts by her family to &quot;redeem&quot; her would end in failure.  She would be adopted into the tribe, convert to Catholicism (the deepest blow to her family), and eventually marry a warrior and start a family.  Demos wants to illustrate how a clash of cultures in the early 18th century effected a seven year old girl and her family.<br />This is such a fascinating story- a little Puritan English girl finds herself ripped out of one world and thrust into another by historical events completely beyond her understanding.  Yet, she adapts and when she is finally free to choose to go back to her English family, she refuses.  Demos wants this to be a dramatic story told within a scholarly framework.  However, Demos' attempt fails.  It seems he justcouldn't bring himself to just tell a story.  Instead he felt compelled to satisfy the academic demands of his profession and thus chopped up his narrative with ponderous analysis and tiresome quotations of correspondence.  The funny thing is that you can see Demos fighting with himself on how he wants to write this book.  At one point, he attempts to get into the head of Eunice to understand why she eventually rejected her English family for her Mohawk one.  Demos admits that this is completely baseless as historical fact, but he did it anyway because it was fun.  It's too bad he didn't do likewise with the rest of the book.<br />&quot;The Unredeemed Captive&quot; is a noble attempt by an academic historian to reach a greater audience with a scholarly book, but the his strict adherence to the constructs of academic writing results in a failed effort.	2002-07-15

When I read Lynda Durrant's \\"Echohawk,\\" I got the feeling that she had been heavily influenced to write this story by \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" not the James Fennimore Cooper novel, but the outstanding 1992 movie which starred Daniel Day-Lewis as Hawkeye.<br />At age 4, Jonathan Starr was taken captive by Mohican Indians, adopted into the family of the warrior Glickihigan, and renamed Echohawk.  For eight years, he lives among the Mohicans, forgetting his real family, and yearning for the day he can take his place as a man in the tribe.  Although, Echohawk knows that he was born white, and indeed faces prejudice from members of the tribe due to his skin color, he really does not dwell on why he has come to live among the Mohicans.  However, his adopted father decides that Echohawk has reached an age when he should be allowed to decide whether he wishes to remain a Mohican or return to the people he was born to.  So Glickihigan enrolls Echohawk and his blood son, a mischevious seven year old called Bamaineo, in a whiteman's school and has them board at the schoolteacher's home.  Glickihigan wants his sons to be able to speak English and understand the whites' ways so they can survive in a world that is coming to be dominated by the Europeans, but he also wants Echohawk to make a decision on who he will be in life.<br />Of course, being immersed in the whiteman's world triggers Echohawk's memories of his former life as Jonathan.  These memories cause him to recall his real family and ask the question: what happened to them?  And just as important, what was Glickihigan's involvement in how a white boy called Jonathan Starr ended up living as a Mohican called Echohawk?<br />Durrant seems to have written a story that could be very well be construed as a sort of \\"The Last of the Mohicans: The Early Years\\" with Glickihigan as Chingachgook, Bamaineo as Uncus, and Echohawk as Hawkeye.  In fact, Durrant even describes the destruction of the Mohicans from disease and thus sets the stage for Glickihigan and Bamaineo to be \\"the last of the Mohicans.\\"  As stated before Durrant seems to be more influenced by the film than Cooper's novel, in that, like the movie, the Hawkeye-like character, Echohawk, is the adopted son of the Chingachgook-like character, Glickihigan, and not just a friend as in the novel.  Also, Echohawk is starting to develop the skills of an outstanding hunter and marksman- how Hawkeye like!<br />I think young boys between the age of 9-12 might enjoy this book especially if they have interest in American Indians and history.  However, it's not exactly an action packed saga, but more of a coming of age story of a boy figuring out his past and what his future will be.  And thus, it may not appeal to boys looking for a pure adventure story.  Finally, Durrant has written a sequel to this book called \\"Turtle Clan Journey.\\" It would be interesting to know whether she continues to write about Echohawk and, if so, does she plan on letting him grow into a juvenile literature version of Daniel Day-Lewis' Hawkeye?	2002-07-13
US	51077042	R3ICNHJXRG3WBC	0345448847	557112399	Panzer Aces	Books	3	17	19	N	N	Stories not history	\\"Panzer Aces\\" by Frank Kurowski tells the combat stories of six different tank commanders who fought for the German Army in WWII.<br />The main problem I have with this book is that there is no information given about how the author compiled these stories. Are they memoirs? Dramatized interviews? The author's own creations based on his research? The reader is not told. One of the stories reads like a memoir, Rudolf von Ribbentrop's is told in a 1st person narrative, but the other five stories all refer to their subjects in the 3rd person. So what were Kurowski's sources for those five stories? Undoubtedly, interviews with some of these \\"aces\\" were a source, but nothing is told about when or how these interviews were conducted. Also, some of the \\"aces\\" in the book did not survive the war, like Michael Wittman, so the author had to access other sources to write this book, but we are not informed of them- no endnotes, no bibliography, no nothing! So what the reader is left with are just stories and not history.<br />The book contains lots of descriptions of combat, but it's pretty whitewashed stuff. Mainly, the book is about German tankers blowing up Russian vehicles by the boatload. However, little of the horror, stress, exhaustion, and agony of combat is detailed, which is surprising and disappointing for a book focusing mostly on combat on the Russian Front.<br />Finally, this is a translation of German language book, but the English translation was not particularly well done. Poor sentence structure and awkward phrases will constantly remind the reader that this is a translated work.<br />\\"Panzer Aces\\" may make fun, light reading for recreational history buffs, but serious students of history should approach this one with caution.	2002-06-13

It suffers too much from conjecture, the use of legends, contrived conversations, and outright fabrications to qualify as history. The most egregious example is Eckert's perpetuation of the myth that the Shawnee war chief, Blue Jacket, was actually a whiteman called Marmaduke Van Swearingen. A few years ago DNA tests proved conclusively that the descendants of the Van Swearingens and of Blue Jacket are not related.  In fairness to Eckert such evidence was not available when he wrote \\"The Frontiersmen.\\" Still, the story of Blue Jacket being a whiteman had always rested on rather shaky historical foundations, but, as is typical with \\"The Frontiersmen,\\" Eckert chose drama over facts.<br />\\"The Frontiersman\\" maybe fiction, but it's really well done fiction. It's purpose is to tell the story of the old Northwest Territory by narrating the story of Simon Kenton- a Virginia born frontiersman who if hadn't saved Daniel Boone's life then maybe Fess Parker would have been playing him instead of Boone on that TV series. I agree with another reviewer that there was another \\"West\\" in American popular culture before what we today think of as \\"the West.\\" Like the West of our current culture, the Northwest Territory generated its own legends for people in the 19th century. Before Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill, General Custer, Wyatt Earp, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo; there was Daniel Boone, David Duncan, George Rogers Clarke, Logan, Black Snake, Little Turtle, Tecumseh, and Simon Kenton. Eckert wants people to remember those later names and their era which mostly encompassed a vicious struggle for the \\"dark and bloody ground\\" of the Ohio River country.<br />Eckert's Narratives of America series, of which \\"The Frontiersmen\\" was the first book, hold a special place in my memory. I spent a great deal of time during junior high school reading andre-reading Eckert's novels. I truly loved them. Of course, to a twelve year old, the best parts of Eckert's novels were the grisly detailed depictions of torture and mutilation. These books are not for the squimish! But for those who like some gore with their historical fiction then these are the books for you.<br />\\"The Frontiersmen\\" is a wonderful dramatization of the people and events that shaped the Northwest Territory, but keep in mind that it is historical fiction while reading.	2002-04-15

Kenneth Roberts was one of America's finest writers of historical fiction- mainly because he actually really knew the history into which he placed his fictional characters.<br />\\"Northwest Passage\\" is arguably his most popular work, and its Book I was made into a pretty good 1940 movie with Robert Young as the fictional Langdon Towne and Spencer Tracy as the legendary Robert Rogers.  (I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in \\"Northwest Passage\\" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.)  Anyway \\"Northwest Passage,\\" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.<br />Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read.  It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War.  The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting \\"true life\\" subjects such as Indians.  Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis.  What happens next is a thrilling story.  Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read.  Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne.  The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.<br />Book II, though, is a disappointment.  Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure.  Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I.  Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character.  Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England.  Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place.  However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.<br />Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but \\"Northwest Passage\\" is lacking in this department.  The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly.  And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.<br />\\"Northwest Passage's\\" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction.  I cannot speak more highly of it.  However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I.  Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I.	2002-04-15

I have a more recent edition of this book with a much more action oriented cover- historical military artist James Dietz's depiction of the 82nd Airborne attacking Nijmegen bridge on Sept. 20, 1944.<br />Tim Saunder's \\"Nijmegen\\" is the first of a trilogy of travel log/historical narratives about the fighting along the route to the Dutch city of Arnhem during Operation Market-Garden in Sept. 1944. The efforts of the U.S. 101st Airborne and British Guards divisions to secure the route from the Belgian border to the Dutch town of Veghel are covered in the second volume, \\"Hell's Highway.\\" And a third volume, \\"The Island,\\" will cover the action between Nijmegen and Arnhem. \\"Nijmegen,\\" of course, covers the middle sector of the operation- the area between the Dutch cities of Grave and Nijmegen which was the responsiblity of the famed U.S. 82nd Airborne.<br />These books are part of a larger series called Battleground Europe whose purpose is to combine the historical narrative of a military operation with travel information for tourists wishing to view the battlefields. I was intially turned off by this concept because in my opinion the history detailed in most travel logs was often extremely lightweight and inaccurate. However, the purpose of the Battleground Europe series is to correct that perception of historical travel logs. I really can't say that the Battleground Europe Series are good travel books. They do have driving instructions, points of interest locations, very general lodging and eating recommendations, and photos of how these battlefields look today. But I can say that the books of this series are really, excellently detailed history books.<br />The books of this series are thin volumes with none of them being much more than 200 pages. The books themselves are physically small since they were designed to be travel books. Also, they're are plenty of photos, many of them historically rare, and maps spread throughout the books which further cuts down on the text. So what remains is a bare bones narrative which is occassionally intercut with veteran recollections. There is little analysis, although in \\"Nijmegen\\" and \\"Hell's Highway\\" the British author makes an occassional apologia for British XXX Corps. Also, no footnotes or bibliography are provided. <br />However, the narrative format is very well done.  Since \\"Nijemgen\\" only concentrates on a portion of the massive Market-Garden operation, it's able to offer a much more detailed description of the 82nd's fight than most books that deal with the operation as a whole such as Cornelius Ryan's legendary \\"A Bridge Too Far.\\" Also, the attention to historical detail is impressive with the author giving the correct types of vehicles and planes present during the action. (He even corrects some of the veterans' recollections such as when an American veteran mistakenly recalls the Typhoons supporting his unit as \\"Spitfires.\\" An understandable mistake since I'm sure that man had more important things on his mind at the time than figuring out what type of plane was blasting the German positions opposite, but it sure makes it confusing to those who want to know the actual details. Stephen Ambrose should take note because he unquestionally accepts often inaccurate veteran descriptions of every German tank being a \\"Tiger\\" and every German gun being an \\"88.\\")<br />These are really a terrific set of books for any serious WWII buff. Please do not be scared off by the Dietz covers or the travel log format since these are actually excellent military history books. If you're looking for a straight narrative and some very interesting historical photos then I cannot more highly reccommend \\"Nijmegen\\" and the Battleground Europe series.	2002-04-06

It's quite simply the kind of book that gives history books a bad name.  I'm a lifelong history buff,  but this book helped make me understand why so many people think history is boring.<br />I was a history major so I read scores of books during college, and &quot;The Greeks,&quot; the book I most detested, remains the clearest memory of my academic college life.  Why?  The class for which this book was assigned was taught by a very old Jesuit priest.  Every week we had to read one or two chapters of this book and then take a fill-in-the-blank quiz on the reading.  The old priest allowed the students to grade their own quizzes while he announced the answers.  Of course, two thirds of the class cheated like crazy.  I was one of the few who didn't cheat.  I read and re-read &quot;The Greeks&quot; before each quiz, but did very average.  As the semester went on, I grew quite angry that my grade would be harmed by the quizzes while the cheaters benefited, and all because this kindly priest was too old to know what was happening.  Of course, not being a rat, I kept my mouth shut.  However, near the end of the semester, after the last quiz had just been completed, the priest announced that we didn't have time to grade them so the class should turn them in.  You must have seen the faces of the cheaters!  Some of them were so stunned that they even turned in their blank quizzes with their names on the top.  The smarter ones, knowing they had just been caught, didn't even bother turning theirs in.  I turned mine in- completed.  Despite how lousy I did on those quizzes, I got an A in that class.  I like to think that old Jesuit planned that all along as a test of honor, and that he picked H.D.F. Kitto's &quot;The Greeks&quot; simply because it was unreadable and that the quizzes would be very tough.  That story is the reason why I recall my memory of &quot;The Greeks&quot; with fondness.	2002-03-12

This is a very well-written history of one the most famous battles of World War II which was written for a general audience.  Those looking for a David Glantz-like, academic study of the campaign should pass this one by.  Eisenhower is a very skilled writer, and his description of the first weeks of the German offensive is very well done.<br />The book does have some problems.  Being the son of the former commander of the ETO and President,  Eisenhower had access to interview for his research many of the top commanders who fought in the battle.  However, that strength could also be a weakness because most of those commanders interviewed were friends and comrades of his father.  Thus, Eisenhower is rarely if ever critical of any of the commanders despite the fact that serious errors were made on the eve of the campaign on the part of the American high command.  Also the book is full of GI slang such as \\"burp guns,\\" which may have been recognizable to readers in the early 60's, but not so in the 21st century.	2002-03-11

I think it would have been a more intriguing story if Maggie had been allowed to more fully explore the 18th century world she stumbled in upon.  Instead she only makes hestitant steps into it.  Maggie's tentative reaction is probably a realistic one, but, since time travel stories are pure fantasy anyway, her reaction is not a particularly interesting one.  Also I thought the sudden appearance of romantic feelings between two characters, who barely interact with each other throughout the book, came across as tacked on and contrived.<br />However, \\"Dark Shade\\" does have one great strength- the author's wonderfully detailed description of the primeval forest that once stretched across Pennsylvannia.  Thanks to Ms. Curry's description, the reader can almost see, smell, and feel that dark, ancient, and never-ending forest.  Also the author reminds the reader that people in the 18th century weren't so big on bathing so that their aroma must have been rather pungent.	2002-02-05

One thing that really impressed me was that Balkoski does not assume that the reader is already knowledgeable of the subject. Therefore, he very clearly describes military terminology, weapons, orders of battle, and the tactical doctrines of the American and German armies. Balkoski does not assume that his readers know how many men made up a squad, what is a MG42 or a BAR, and how armies are organized. He really does a great job of making it all clear and very interesting. As a result I would recommend \\"Beyond the Beachhead\\" to a novice military history buff despite its narrow focus on a single division's actions in one campaign.<br />I noticed another reviewer compare \\"Beyond the Beachhead\\" unfavorably to the work of Stephen Ambrose. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Balkoski's research over Ambrose's. Balkoski pays attention to details, whereas Ambrose coasts on getting the facts straight. (For a man who has researched WWII as long as he has it amazes me that Ambrose still incorrectly describes weapons and grossly distorts unit sizes.) However, Ambrose wrote the forward for this edition of \\"Beyond the Beachhead,\\" which was no doubt done to help sales, giving it his seal of approval as America's unofficial WWII \\"authority.\\" Thus, it is the height of irony that Ambrose now stands accused of \\"borrowing\\" passages wholesale from \\"Beyond the Beachhead\\" for his own book \\"Citizen Soldiers.\\"	2002-02-03

Stephen Ambrose has recently been exposed as the extremely poor historian he truly is with charges of plagiarism being leveled against several of his books. Ambrose's problems as a historian start with his research methods and sources. He relies too heavily on secondary source material (which is how he got into trouble), and for his WWII material, on oral interviews with veterans done decades after the events described. (Yes, the stories are great, but time has a way of altering even the most seering memories.)  Ambrose's weaknesses as a historian have been partly covered up by his ability as a writer. One does not become a best-selling author of history without being a great writer.<br />However, it was one of his essays in \\"Americans at War\\" that made me realize what a hack Ambrose is as a historian. His essay on Custer's Civil War career is example enough of his poor research and prejudices. Ambrose starts the essay with an attack on another historian, Robert Utley, whom he accuses of being too laudatory of Custer's Civil War generalship in his book \\"Cavalier in Buckskin.\\" Robert Utley is considered by many to be the dean of American Western history- a well-respected scholar and researcher. Utley used mainly primary source material to build his case that Custer had a pretty exceptional Civil War career, but Ambrose attacks that view by using dated secondary source material. Ambrose's essay on Custer is a pure historical hack job- full of half-truths, blatant distortions, and goofy comparisons.<br />Ambrose's analysis of Custer's Civil War is just a reiteration of dated scholarship that owes its roots to a 1934 biography by Frederick Van de Water, which portrayed Custer as a very reckless commander.  However, Van de Water's conclusions have come under serious attack in recent decades by numerous Western and Civil War historians and scholars. (See the work of: Louise Barnett, Jeffrey Wert, Paul Hutton, Gregory Urwin, Gordon Rhea, Stephen Starr, Richard Slotkin, andnumerous others.) Thus, Ambrose's essay is so out of step with current scholarship that it is laughable. Maybe I would have been more persuaded if Ambrose had provided quotes from people who served with Custer during the Civil War which would support Ambrose's views. There are none. Maybe I would persuaded if Ambrose discussed more fully Custer's performance in 1864-1865, after he had gained experienced, and not concentrated so much on his performance in 1863 when he was promoted from a staff position to the command of a brigade. Maybe I would have been persuaded...I could go on and on about this truly shoddy piece of historical research.<br />I own several Ambrose books, and while I admire his writing ability, his credibility as a historian really sunk to rock bottom with \\"Americans at War.\\" It's just a shame that it finally took accusations of plagiarism to expose him as the hack he truly is.	2002-01-19

One of the biggest fallacies about the Little House books is that they are &quot;girls' books.&quot;  It was that perception of the books, as well as the sappy, smaltzy &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; TV show, that kept me from reading these books until I was in my early teens.  One day just out of sheer boredom, I read my sister's worn copy of &quot;Little House in the Big Woods.&quot;  What a great book!  A story of a family's survival in the wilderness with tales of bears, panthers, wolves, hunting, and all sorts of neat information on how pioneer people lived.  &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; erased my conception of the Little House books as &quot;girlie stuff&quot; and I promptly read the rest of the series.<br />Yes, some elements will appeal more to girls especially Mrs. Wilder's very detailed descriptions of women's clothing.  (I generally just read what color the dress was and then skip over the rest of the description.)  However, her stories about Indians, wild animals, blizzards, grasshopper storms, bandits, bullies threatening to beat up teachers, unruly students, unhinged farmwives, bossy older sisters, and a whole host of other great stuff will make these books fascinating to anyone interested in pioneer life regardless of gender.<br />Despite my age I still consider these among my favorite books.  They are truly heartwarming classics with the magnificent illustrations of Garth Williams.  Laura, the main character, will appeal to almost anyone- honest, principled, courageous, industrious, but with very human elements- including envy of her older sister and holding grudges, especially against snooty Nellie Oleson and her teacher (and future sister-in-law) Eliza Jane Wilder.  The books are also a tribute to her father, Charles Ingalls, who emerges as a truly great man and father.  A hard-working man upon whom fortune did not always smile, but always was able to remain unbowed regardless of misfortune.  He was also a strict disciplinarian, who did not believe in sparing the rod, but also a truly loving father, who would do anything for his girls.  Charles Ingalls, as seen through the eyes of his daughter, is a man worthy of any reader's respect.<br />For those who see images of Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert when they hear the words, &quot;Little House,&quot; please give the books a chance.  They are really nothing like the TV series.  Although Laura Ingalls Wilder infused her books with a great deal of sentimentality- they never descend into the maudlin syrup that was the hallmark of the TV series.  One example of how different they truly are would be how they represented how Mary, Laura's older sister, lost her eyesight.  In &quot;On the Shores of Silver Lake&quot; Laura describes how scarlet fever robbed her sister of her sight, but also proudly describes how that tragedy never brought Mary to tears.  Mary always remained &quot;patient and brave.&quot;  In contrast, the TV show has Mary wailing, moaning, and carrying on until her family ships her off to a school for the blind. (In the books, Mary does eventually go to a college for the blind, but only after years of being an important and valuable member of the family despite her disability.)  Once again, the Little House series is a perfect example of the books being vastly superior to any TV or film conversion.	2002-01-15

Elizabeth George Speare only wrote four books that I'm aware of, and all but one were awarded a Newbery Award.  (And the one that did not win an award, &quot;Calico Captive,&quot; is one of my favorite books of all time!)  Ms. Speare was quite simply a fantastic writer of historical fiction.  Her books are written in a style suitable for young readers, but anybody who loves historical fiction will love her work regardless of age!  It's such a shame that she did not write more books.<br />I admit that I had my reservations about &quot;The Bronze Bow,&quot; since its setting in 1st century Judea seemed incongrous with Ms. Speare's other books which are all set in colonial New England.  Also, although I'm a practicing Catholic, I was not keen on reading a fictional book with Jesus as a character fearing some very dry, preachy version of the most famous man in history would ruin the believability of the story.  But my reservations were completly unfounded.  Ms. Speare describes life in Roman occupied Judea with the same wonderful detail as she did colonial America.  She ably describes the political/historical situation with great skill while weaving it into her fictional story of a young man deciding which path he will choose in life.<br />Daniel, the protagonist, is as three dimensional and believable as Kit Tyler in &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond.&quot;  In fact, all the characters are memorably brought to life especially Daniel's emotionally devastated, younger sister, Leah.  However, the major surprise is Ms. Speare's portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth- what a wonderful depiction of that itinerate preacher.  Jesus is a supporting but crucial character in the narrative, but Ms. Speare does not use him to preach to the reader.  Instead, the reader, like Daniel, is left to decide who Jesus is- just a kind-hearted teacher?  A miracle worker?  Someone unwilling to take sides?  The messiah?  Daniel is puzzled by these questions because the Jesus he sees is just a human being and not a resurrected savior in glowing robes.<br />&quot;The Bronze Bow&quot; is arguably Ms. Speare's strongest novel, and that says alot considering her other work.  It's historical fiction at its finest, and anyone who passes on it because of fears of it being &quot;too religious&quot; or &quot;too preachy&quot; are doing themselves a disservice.  A great work of fiction is a great work fiction regardless if one of the characters happens to be Jesus of Nazareth.	2001-11-14

The Battle of the Bulge: The Story and Photographs (America Goes to War)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Photographic History of the Battle	This is a coffee table sized collection of photographs of the persons and events of the Battle of the Bulge.  Although it does contain a text with information about commanders, weapons, and the overall course of the battle, the book is mainly interested in describing what is happening in its numerous photos.  Of particular interest are the photos made by the Germans.  The German photographers paid close attention to the large numbers of stunned American POWs, wrecked and abandoned American vehicles, and the corpses of fallen GIs.  It's a different perspective from the usual pictures of advancing and victorious Americans.  Also of note is that this book finally lays to rest one of the biggest inaccuracies of the photographic record of the war- proving that the famous picture of cigar chewing SS trooper next to the Malmedy sign is NOT infamous SS Lt. Col. Jochen Peiper.	2001-10-28

I believe this was Alexander Thom's first novel, and it certainly reads like a first time effort.  It's not half as good as his later works like &quot;Follow the River&quot; or &quot;The Red Heart.&quot;  In &quot;Long Knife&quot; Thom recounts Patriot George Rogers Clarke's epic march during the Revolutionary War to destroy British power on the western frontier.  Thom is only partly successful in relaying this powerful tale into a moving work of fiction.  The weakest element is a cliched and poorly developed romantic subplot involving Clarke and a Spanish commandant's sister.  Pretty amateurish stuff.  However, the strength of the novel is, of course, Clarke's army's 240 mile epic winter march, including long stretches through icy waist-deep water, to attack the British fort at Vincennes.  It's here where Thom really shines bringing immense detail to the agony and fatigue faced by those men.  (It's actually very reminiscent of Kenneth Roberts' description in his terrific novel &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; of a similar march by the famed Robert Rogers and his Rangers during the French and Indian War.)  Unfortunately, Clarke's march is just a small part of the book and, although it's historical fiction writing at its best, it does not completely atone for the weak parts of &quot;Long Knife.&quot;<br />I would recommend this book to Revolutionary War buffs and Alexander Thom fans.  However, if you're new to Alexander Thom then I would recommend you check out some of his later books before reading &quot;Long Knife,&quot; his first attempt at a historical novel.	2001-10-28

But sharper ears could sometimes detect a note more sinister.&quot;  Thus, Sterling North, the author of Newberry Winner &quot;Rascal&quot;, starts his biography of the early adventures of the French-Canadian voyageur, Pierre Esprit Radisson.  In history Radisson, along with his brother-in-law Medard Chouart, Sieur de Grossilliers, is best known for the mid-17th century explorations of the upper Great Lakes and Hudson Bay regions which led to the founding of the famed Hudson Bay Company.  However, North's biography focuses not on Radisson's rather limited contributions to history, but on his adventures as young man: his capture and adoption by the fearsome Mohawks at age 16, his escape from a French mission besieged by hundreds of Iroquois warriors at age 20, and his journey to the western shore of Lake Superior where he became the first white man to meet the Dakota Sioux at age 25.<br />This book was written for young boys between ages 9-12.  It is very readable and is packed with battles, escapes, hardships, and epic journeys.  Radisson's young life was the stuff of movies!  It also includes some wonderful, although highly romaticized, illustrations of Pierre and his adventures.  North clearly loved the subject and included in the text some passages from Pierre's own autobiography, &quot;Voyages,&quot; complete with 17th century spelling which may be confusing to young readers.  However, North's imagery of the untouched North American wilderness and thrilling portrait of a young Frenchman's adventures with various Eastern Woodland tribes is what makes this biography so wonderful.	2001-09-02

It wasn't until I started to read McMurtry's &quot;Streets of Laredo,&quot; which is the sequel to &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; that I realized how much I truly love the original novel.  In the first couple of pages of &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; McMurtry describes the deaths of two of the surviving characters from &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot;  I was so shocked and angry that I threw the book down.  In fact, I was so upset at McMurtry for casually killing off two of my favorite characters that it took me a month until I could bring myself to open &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; again.  Silly, isn't?  To get that angry over the wholly fictional deaths of completely fictional characters.  However, that is the effect of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; a novel so wonderful that it brings to life numerous characters who are so three dimensional and enjoyable that they *almost* become like friends to the reader.<br />I will not go into any plot or character details since others have already done that very well, but I did want to describe how this novel can effect even a jaded reader such as myself.  I truly came to love the characters in this novel, and that is as high of praise as I can give any literary work.	2001-07-30

Often forgotten amongst the state volunteers, who had made up the vast majority of Civil War armies, are the men who had made up the pre-war Army- the regulars.  These professional soldiers had a reputation for steadiness under fire, and were often held up as examples to be emulated by their amateur comrades.  In the east, the regular infantry regiments were organized together in one division in the V Corps which fought in some of the bloodiest engagements of the war.  By mid 1864, the regulars were gone- devoured by Gettysburg's Wheatfield and the Wilderness.<br />It's an interesting story of the destruction of a very fine body of fighting men, and that is what led me to attempt to read Reese's book.  I use the word &quot;attempt&quot; because after a few chapters I threw the book down in digust.  I could not believe the number of errors that populated this book- dates were wrong, incorrect names of commanders ect.  Some of them were so blatantly wrong that even many novice Civil War buffs will spot them.  One would think that the author would have grasped the basic facts of the overall war before diving into a study on such a narrow topic.  It's obvious Reese had little grasp of the Civil War history before he focused like a laser on the history of one division of the Army of the Potomac.  It is a perfect example of unable to see the forest because of the trees.	2001-07-03

His books are well researched and detailed enough to appeal to the hardcore buff, but are so extremely readable that they can be recommended to the novice Civil War reader.  Sears' books have the sort of &quot;it's so good that I can't put it down&quot; quality more often found in the best historical fiction novels than in campaign studies.  Sears is a truly gifted writer.<br />In &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; Sears tackles a subject that has been well-covered by many other authors including Ernest Furguson's very fine 1992 book, &quot;Chancellorsville: Souls of the Brave.&quot;  In order to justify another book about Chancellorsville, Sears had to approach the subject from a different perspective than previous writers, and Sears does this by reappraising Joseph Hooker's leadership of the Army of the Potomac.  Most histories of Chancellorsville have portrayed Hooker as a commander full of boasts and swagger about his upcoming triumph who then lost his nerve (and the battle) when RE Lee didn't act the way Hooker thought he was supposed to.  Sears attacks this convential view by portraying Hooker as an effective planner who was more sinned against than sinner.  Sears portrays the unbelievable communications breakdowns by the Federals, and the failings of key subordinates, in particular cavalry chief George Stoneman and ill-fated XI Corps commander Oliver Howard, as the major reasons for the defeat.<br />Sears makes some very good points in his defense of Hooker, especially the down-right incompetence of certain subordinates.  However, as another reviewer has stated, Sears' &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; is revisionist history, and, in the end, this reader was unconvinced that Hooker's own failings were not the chief cause of his defeat.  Aside from some disagreement with Sears' analysis, I do believe &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; to be one of the best campaign studies I have ever read and highly recommend it.	2001-07-02

I remember the original hardcover edition of this book very well: the large coffeetable size, the wonderful illustrations including many full color plates, maps pointing out the areas where the various tribes once lived, and a brief description of each tribe's history.<br />I've always wanted a copy of this book of my own (I used to borrow the copy from my gradeschool library all the time), and thus was quite pleased to see that it had been reprinted with a 2nd edition in 1999.  I was a little apprehenisve about the fact that it's only available in paperback and that the cover illustration had been changed (the original hardcover featured a beautiful painting of two Indian hunters in the winter), but I was very happy to finally be able to order a copy.  Unfortunatly, I'm disappointed in the 2nd edition's appearrance- the book has been shrunk from coffeetable size to mid-sized textbook, and all the color illustrations have been reprinted in black and white.  &quot;Great Lake Indians&quot; by William Kubiak is a beautiful book, if you can get the hardcover with the color illustrations; the 2nd edition paperback, on the other hand, is a low budget imitation.	2001-06-26

I don't think there is too much I can add to the judgement of my fellow reviewers to the fact that &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; is a terrific work of historical fiction.  I read it in less than three days, and I think that is all evidence needed to show how much I enjoyed this book.  I simply could not put it down!<br />However, I do have some complaints.  First and foremost is that the book features too much of the imbecilic and irritating Cap Huff and not enough of the vastly more intriguing Marie de Sabervois.  The more I read &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot;, the more I became annoyed with the character of Cap Huff and its boring, man-child, comic-relief antics.  (And how many times can Roberts apply variations of the word &quot;bawl&quot; to this mentally challenged character?)  If I was going to be really cruel I would describe Cap Huff as the literary equivilent of Jar-Jar Binks, but that would be really cruel.  On the other hand, I found the character of Marie de Sabervois to be extremely interesting, but Roberts' features her only fleetingly throughout the novel.  One of the big reasons I read &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; was that I wanted to read more about this captivating character who was introduced in &quot;Arundel.&quot;  Roberts, however, gives the reader plenty of Cap Huff's &quot;bawling,&quot; but keeps Marie de Sabervois a very enigmatic character- a real disappointment.  Also disappointing is that Phoebe Nason, another extremely interesting character from &quot;Arundel,&quot; is seen only briefly in the pages of &quot;Rabble in Arms.&quot;  I would have given &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; five stars, but too much Cap Huff and too little Marie and Phoebe required a star to be removed.<br />Also Roberts' treatment of Benedict Arnold is a little hard to swallow at times.  Even a person with only a casual interest in the Revolutionary War is aware that Benedict Arnold was one of the Patriots' best commanders and bravest soldiers before he commited his act of treachery.  Roberts' uses &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; to reiterate that point; but I think he &quot;doth protest too much.&quot;  Roberts' paints a picture of Arnold that borders on god-like.  He's shown as a genius, a hero, and one of the few decent men on tbe Patriot side.  Maybe this view of Arnold is understandable since Arnold is described to the reader through the eyes of one his adoring soldiers; but it would have been more believable if at least some cracks were shown in the coat of shining white armor that Roberts places on Benedict Arnold.	2001-01-06

It not only inspired me to read other books by James Alexander Thom, but also made me want to find out more about Frances Slocum.  It was in doing this research that I discovered that Thom had played a little loose with the facts of Slocum's abduction.  I believe he did this simply to place her Indian abductors in a better light.  Yes, it was a little disconcerting; but this discovery did not ruin my overall enjoyment of the book.<br />The novel attempts to view the history of Old Northwest from a very pro-Native perspective.  Thom wants the reader to be fully aware that what happened to the Indians of the Old Northwest was a tragedy and a blot on the history of the U.S.  And I think he is absolutely correct in that viewpoint.  However, I felt that occassionally he went a little overboard in attempting to illustrate this point.  His portrayal of the differences between whites and Indians sometimes came across as simplistic and condenscending.  It can be annoying since I've read children's books on the subject of Indian captivities that presented a more even handed and realistic look at racial relations- Sally Keehn's &quot;I Am Regina&quot; is an excellent example that shows that cruelty could be found on both sides.<br />However, &quot;The Red Heart's&quot; political correctness is a quibble that really does not deter from its effectiveness as a terrific novel.  It's really well-written, and is about one of the most poignant and fascinating stories in American history.

More recently, I enjoyed reading her first memoir &quot;A Girl from Yamhill.&quot;  Therefore, I just had to read her second memoir, &quot;My Own Two  Feet&quot; which chronicles her life through college, her work as a  librarian, her marriage, and the beginning of her life as a children's  author.  I loved it!  It not only provides a wonderful insight into the  mindset and character of its author; but also presents a vivid, sometimes  very nostalgic, look at life in the 30's and 40's.  It describes an America  that has disappeared.  A college social life that revolved around a  seemingly endless number of dances and a strict code of decorum on how  young women should dress and act.  A small town opposed to the idea of  having two married librarians since jobs were so scarce during the  Depression that it was considered fair enough for just the husband to have  a job.  Also as a Catholic, I was amused by Beverly's parents' opposition  to her marriage to Clarence Cleary simply because he was  Catholic.<br />There's also some fun information for the fans of her fictional  books.  Readers will learn how Ribsy and Ramona got their names and what  was Mrs. Cleary's original ending to &quot;Henry Huggins.&quot;  It's also  interesting to note that the character of Ramona Quimby, which is arguably  Mrs. Cleary's most beloved, was created simply as an afterthought to keep  all her characters from being only children.  I absolutely loved this book,  and was disappointed it was so short!	2000-07-05

Like the other reviewers here, I was addicted to the books of Beverly Cleary when I was child.  Mrs. Cleary's books provided me endless hours of enjoyment, and I still remember laughing out loud at the adventures and  misadventures of her characters.  Eventually, I grew up and Mrs. Cleary's  books became just fond remembrances of my childhood.<br />Remembrances are  what they remained until I re-read &quot;Otis Spofford&quot; a couple weeks  ago.  Despite my age, I still found myself laughing out loud while I read  it.  It was that experience that led me to read &quot;A Girl from  Yamhill.&quot;  I wanted to find out more about the woman whose mere name  on a book ensured to me as a child a wonderful reading experience.<br />What a  terrific autobiography!  I read it in one day.  I loved the simple, but  honest writing style that can also be found in her fictional books.  I also  recognized many of the experiences of her girlhood that eventually ended up  among the adventures of her fictional characters: tin cans and twine,  misinterpreting the words to national anthem, the boys chewing garlic, and  the green paint for Christmas.  However, what struck me as the best part of  &quot;A Girl from Yamhill&quot; was how ordinary Beverly Bunn was as a  girl.  She wasn't poor or rich.  She got good grades; but occassionally  they slipped.  She wasn't in the popular cliques; but she wasn't an  outcast.  She never got into any major trouble; but she wasn't a saint.   Yes, her mother was emotionally detached and controlling; but she wasn't  abusive or meanspirited.  Teenaged Beverly spends alot of time worrying  about her clothes and boys just like any other teenage girl.  I was amazed  how much I enjoyed reading about the life of an average, ordinary girl.  Of  course, that girl did have one major talent- she could write, and that  talent is what makes &quot;A Girl from Yamhill&quot; such a joy- Beverly  Cleary is a fantastic writer.  She brings everything so vividly to life,and provides the reader not only insight into her own character, but also  gives a glimpse of what life was really like in the Oregon of the 1920's  and 30's.  A great, great book!	2000-06-27

After reading the reviews here, I agree totally with the comparisons of Frederick Chiaventone's &quot;A Road We Do Not Know&quot; to Shaara's &quot;The Killer Angels.&quot;  This book is that good!<br />Chiaventone's  wonderful dramatization is simply the best fictional account of the Little  Bighorn that I have ever read.  The reader is taken from moment Custer's  scouts spot the hostile village's pony herd in the pre-dawn darkness of  June 25, 1876 to the burying of the torn, mutilated remains of 265 American  soldiers on June 27.  In between the men and events of that battle are  brought vividly to life with terrific historical detail and well-thought  out conjecture.  Chiaventone goes into the thought processes of the  commanders, both white and Indian, and the emotions of the average soldier  or warrior.  It is refreshing to see Lakota and Cheyenne leaders portrayed  as able tacticians, and not just inspirational leaders without any thought  of how to engage the enemy.  Chiaventone shows Gall and Crazy Horse  outthinking the 7th Cavalry as well as outfighting and outnumbering  them.<br />It is also refreshing to see Chiaventone trying to rehabilitate the  military reputation of General Custer.   Over that last fifteen years, many  historians (Utley, Hutton, Wert, Barnett ect.) have tried to tear down the  current popular image of Custer as a blustering, racist, glory-hunting  fool, and some novelists, such as Chiaventone and Michael Blake, have  followed suit.  In &quot;A Road We Do Not Know&quot;, George A. Custer is  shown as a very capable and experienced commander.  (You don't become a  brevet major general at the age of 25 for being an idiot!)  Is he portrayed  as Errol Flynn?  No!  But he is also not portrayed as a one dimensional,  cardboard villain like on &quot;Dr. Quinn.&quot;  However, Custer's image  is so intertwined with our national guilt over the treatment of the Indian  that I don't think his reputation will ever fully be rehabilitated, but Ido take my hat off to Chiaventone for trying.<br />It's a shame that Simon and  Schuster really did not support this book when they published it, it  deserves a far bigger following.  It also deserves to be ranked with  &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; as one of the finest pieces of historical  fiction on the subject of men in combat.	2000-06-19

To Otis excitement means upstaging a playacting toreador, shooting spitballs at classmates and even his teacher, sabotaging a class experiment, upstaging a  friend while helping the local football hero, and especially chasing and  teasing the very prim and proper Ellen Tebbitts.  Otis' classmates and  teacher warn him that someday he will get his comeuppance for his antics.   When Otis takes his teasing of Ellen too far then his comeuppance finally  happens.<br />Beverly Cleary's &quot;Otis Spofford&quot; was one of the  funniest books I ever read.  I particularly enjoyed Otis' comments on how  &quot;dopey&quot; the characters in the books he had to read for school  acted.  Ms. Cleary obviously wrote &quot;Otis Spofford&quot; for children  who felt the same way about reading as Otis did.  Otis is no dope and  non-readers will love him for it!<br />Some of Ms. Cleary's older books are  sometimes dismissed as being &quot;quaint&quot; or out of date with their  50's settings and families (father works and mom stays at home.)   &quot;Otis Spofford&quot; was written in 1961, but Otis has a single mother  who owns her own business and they live in an apartment.  In some ways Ms.  Cleary was ahead of her time; but there is no denying that Otis is a  wildboy of the 50's.  &quot;Otis Spofford&quot; is an extremely readable  and hilarious book featuring the wonderful drawings of illustrator Louis  Darling.  (I've always preferred Mr. Darling's idealized illustrations of  very 50's looking children (the girls in dresses or rolled up pants with  moptop hairstyles, the boys in canvas hightop sneakers and bristled  haircuts) which are in Ms. Cleary's older books to the illustrations of her  more recent books which make some of the characters look rather ugly-  Ramona is so much cuter when drawn by Louis Darling than Alan Tiegrin.)	2000-06-19

Nothing in the book seems to be developed!  Characters come and go for no reason such as Serena's  brother who disappears after a couple of pages.  Other characters are never  developed such as Emma Swinton. Is she the accused murderer and why does  she want Humility so badly?  We are never told!  Also Anthony Foxcroft was  such a weak character that his death carries no emotional impact.  The main  character, Serena, does things for no rational reason.  Why did she learn  the Indian language?  Why does she believe that only she can save  Jamestown?  Why she does these things is never explained- she just does  them.  The result is a novel with a plot that is paper thin and very  sketchy.  &quot;The Serpent Never Sleeps&quot; is not one of O'Dell's finer  works.	2000-06-09

It could of have been another Little Bighorn: a few hundredAmerican soldiers found themselves surrounded in enemy territory byseveral thousand, heavily armed irregulars. Like Little Bighorn, it started with a well-intentioned political policy that went terribly off-tangent.  Also like Little Bighorn, the situation was exacerbated by a leadership that had grossly underestimated the fighting ability of the opposition.  If it had not been for the bravery and skill of the American helicopter crews, who really kept the enraged Somali mobs at bay, and the discipline and teamwork of the Rangers and &quot;D-Boys&quot;, which held up under the stress of combat, the outcome could have been the same as that of the Little Bighorn.<br />The Battle of the Black Sea may indeed go down in history as the U.S. Army's most famous &quot;small unit&quot; action since the Little Bighorn thanks to Mark Bowden's excellent book.  The parallels between the two battles are striking especially their aftermaths.  The bodies of Custer's slain troopers were stripped and mutilated as were the bodies of a downed Blackhawk crew and the two D-boys who tried to rescue them.  The images of gleeful Somalians dragging the corpses through the streets are still shocking and infuriating to witness. (Luckily, CNN did not exist in 1876, but stories of the desecreted dead still enraged the nation.) Yet American reactions were exactly the opposite.  Within six months after Custer's defeat, the tribes of the northern Plains were broken.  After Mogadishu, a chastened U.S. gave up its mission, and eventually fled from Africa altogether. The U.S. still carries the guilt of its treatment of the American Indian; yet in 1876 vengeance was more potent than morality.  Has the U.S. finally &quot;grown-up&quot; and learned to cut short its losses before it is too late?  Or is the &quot;Day of the Rangers&quot; an instructional lesson for every powermad, tinhorn &quot;warlord&quot; that the U.S. military is a paper-tiger that will cut and run if some of its soldiers are killed?  &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is both a gripping story of modern warfare and a parallel lesson to our past.	2000-06-05

They complained that there wasn't anything to read that they could relate to.  They asked why weren't there books about kids like them, just average boys?  So Beverly Cleary wrote &quot;Henry Huggins&quot;  for them- a story of an average boy who gets into all sorts of believable  adventures with highly amusing results. It is a GREAT book, and Ms. Cleary  introduced to children's literature some of its greatest characters: Henry  and his dog, Ribsy; and, in later books, his tomboy friend, Beezus, and  Beezus' amazingly pesty kid sister, Ramona.  Everyone of the subsequent  books in the Henry/Ramona series is fantastic- filled with humor and  characters with whom kids can understand and relate.  &quot;Henry  Huggins&quot; started it all and makes a wonderful introduction to Ms.  Cleary's world on Kickalat Street.	2000-05-30

Beverly Cleary wrote some of the funniest books ever written for children with her Henry Huggins/Ramona series.  However, her Newbery honor winner \\"Ramona and Her Father\\" marks the beginning of Mrs. Cleary's decision to include more serious situations into the lives of her characters to go along with their comic adventures.  This book revolves around the very unfunny and realistic situation of Ramona's father losing his job.  (Undoubtedly, Mrs. Cleary drew upon her own childhood memories of her father's unemployment during the Depression to tell this story.) <br />Ramona's life is turned upside down by her father's unemployment. Her father is cranky and depressed, her mother tired from overwork, and older sister Beezus, the funloving tomboy of the Henry Huggins books, is now a temperamental teenager. The book chronicles Ramona's attempts to deal with this difficult situation, and results are touching and very often hilarious. Despite its serious subject matter, the book still retains Mrs. Cleary's comic touch.  This is one very funny book! The chapter about Ramona's hope of becoming a TV commericial actor, which she believes will end her family's problems, is one of the funniest Mrs. Cleary ever wrote. If I had to pick one book from the entire Henry Huggins/Ramona series \\"Ramona and Her Father\\" would be the one. Ramona's experiences with a difficult family situation are told with humor and candor.	2000-05-30

Looking for further reading, I checked  Amazon.com's list of Newbery books and I came upon BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA.  I  was just amazed at the overwhelming number of positive reviews for this  book.  Needless to say, I had to read it for myself.<br />The reviews were  right.  BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a terrific and truly moving reading  experience.  Of course, since so many reviews contained spoilers, the  emotional climax wasn't the big surprise it is supposed to be.  However, it  still packs a powerful, emotional whallop.  Through the character of  &quot;Jess,&quot; the reader experiences joy, sadness, and the realization  of how wonderful, however brief, the gift of friendship can truly be.   BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a fantastic story on the value and joy of life.	2000-05-23

Esther Forbes' story of young Boston boy's adventures during the early days of the American Revolution, &quot;Johnny Tremain,&quot; is a classic of children's historical fiction.  As such it has been required reading for  generations of middle school students, and assigned reading material,  regardless of quality, will always raise the hackles of some students.   Thus the bad reviews here should be taken with a grain of salt.<br />The  strength of this book is how it weaves the fictional story of Johnny  Tremain, who had been a promising silversmith apprentice until an accident  crippled his hand, with the historical events and people of Revolutionary  era Boston.  Johnny deals with the loss of his trade, his attempt to  reclaim his birthright, a burgeoning romance with the daughter of his  former master, and an increasing involvement with the revolutionary  activities of the Sons of Liberty.  The book brings to life the era of the  Revolution and reminds the reader that the simple hope &quot;that a man can  stand up&quot; did not come without tragedy.  &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; is  a true classic, and makes for a great read.

In order to protect their children from harm, thousands of Londoners are sending their children to the country or, if  they can afford it, out of England entirely.  Two orphan girls meet in a  embarkation area.  One girl is from an affluent family and is being sent to  Canada; the other, who is from a working class background, is being sent to  the country.  They are both the same age, look similar to each other, and  have no parents. The rich girl decides that she doesn't want to go to  Canada, and strikes a deal with the poor girl to switch clothes,  destinations, and identities for the duration of the war.  Of course,  neither of them know that the war will last for six years.<br />The rich girl  assumes the life of her poorer counterpart, and discovers a world very  different from that of her own upbringing.  The war ends, and she is a  completly different person than she was six years earlier.  Will she ever  be able to go back to her former life of privilege and wealth?

Among these captives is Stone Girl a young woman who has spent  most of her life with the Indians.  She has even married a warrior and  given birth to a son.  Although she intially avoids returning to the  whites, circumstances have Stone Girl and her son being sold to a French  missionary who then tries to locate her white family.<br />Unlike the  protagonist of &quot;The Light in the Forest,&quot; True Son(who is  reintroduced in the later part of this novel); Stone Girl does have some  hazy memories of her former life among the whites.  And these memories  cause her to be sent to the home of a man thought to be her white father.   Instead of being embraced as the long lost child, Stone Girl is met with  cold indifference and hostility.  Her white mother, who was her clearest  memory, is dead, and a young woman claiming to be the lost daughter has  already imposed herself on the family.  Stone Girl's claims as daughter are  rejected, and she is sent to work as a servant. Only her white father's  Quaker mother, who suspects her son is being deceived by an imposter, holds  any sympathy for this &quot;Indian&quot; girl who could very well be her  real granddaughter.  Will Stone Girl ever find a home for herself and her  son?  Or will she forever walk in a country of strangers?	2000-04-03

Janie learned about why the Johnson's raised her as  their daughter, and she learned about her real family, the Springs.<br />For  twelve years the Springs of New Jersey have agonized over the loss of their  middle daughter, Jennie.  Her disappearance and the uncertainties of her  fate have cast a pall on what is otherwise a large, boisterous family.   Then after twelves years of worry, Jennie was found- alive and very well.   The Springs demand that she come home to her real family.<br />Janie/Jennie is  a total stranger to her real family.  How can she adjust to this completly  alien enviroment?

How can she relate to an older brother and  sister who resent that she actually lived better than they did when they  had feared her abused, dead, or worse at the hands of her kidnapper?  How  can she live without her life-long friends and her boyfriend Reeve?  But  she knows deep-down that she really is Jennie Spring and not Janie Johnson.   In the end she must make the choice between the parents who gave birth to  her and never gave up the hope of finding her, and the parents who raised  her.  There is no right choice here because innocent people will be hurt no  matter what the decision.

Will his village side with the British  and their Seneca allies or will the Delawares stay at peace with their  American neighbors?  War also threatens Coshmoo's personal life.  An  alliance with the British will ensure lead and powder for his beloved  musket, but would endanger his lifelong friendship with an American boy,  Daniel.

I finished this 533 page novel in four days, and I read from page 264 to the ending in one sitting.  I think that pretty much sums it up that I really, really enjoyed reading this book.  It is on such a fascinating subject which is not too often found in adult literature.  Most historical  fiction novels on white children taken captive by the Indians are written  for juvenile or young adult readers.<br />This novel is based on the true  story of Frances Slocum who at age 5 was carried off by Delaware Indians  right in front of her family in 1778.  Her family searched for nearly sixty  years until they finally found her- the widow of a Miami chief who could  not speak any English or even remember her given name except for Slocum.   Thom details what occured in the sixty years before that reunion.  Mostly,  it is a story of young Frances adapting to her new life, her growth into  womanhood, and her experiences with the tragedies that occur to her Indian  people as the Americans take their lands and destroy the entire fabric of  their lives.  Thom also details the Slocums' attempts to find their lost  child during that same period.  Thom does a great job of capturing what  must have been the emotions when that lost sister met her Slocum siblings  for the first time in six decades.  Truly poignant.<br />My only complaint  about this book is Thom's rather simplistic portrayals of the Indians and  whites.  With the exception of the Quaker Slocum family, every white in  this book is a brutish lout; and with the exception of a couple drunken  brutes, the Indians are all portrayed as wonderful people.  The historical  reality was a little more complex, and even most children's books on the  subject of Indian captivities present a more even-handed picture.  For  instance, historically the Indians, who carried off little Frances, also  carried off two other children who they later killed for crying too much,  and that they had killed a &quot;boy&quot; on the Slocum farm.  Thomdoesn't ignore that the Indians also took other captives with Frances or  that they had killed someone at her family's farm, but he has the other  captive being ransomed back to the whites, and he has turned that killed  &quot;boy&quot; into a soldier.  I think that is being a little dishonest  for sake of &quot;political correctness,&quot; which is annoying.	2000-03-11

I was really disappointed that this book was so short; I could have read on and on about Mary Campbell.  I just loved reading as she transformed from a petulant, selfish brat to a person who put the good of her family and community before her own needs. &quot;The Beaded Moccassins&quot; does  not simplify this transformation by making judgements about Europeans or  Indians, instead it shows this transformation as something that occurs out  of sense of maturity and a desire to belong.  A coming of age story as well  as the story of an Indian captive.<br />As I said before I wish it had been  longer.  It only covers the first year or so of what turned into a six year  long captivity.  It would have been great to see the person Mary became  among the Indians at age 18, and how she and both her families, white and  red, reacted to her return to the whites.<br />I grew up near the area where  most of this book takes place.(I am a native of Cleveland, Ohio.) Yet I  never heard of Mary Campbell before I read &quot;The Beaded  Moccassins.&quot;  I enjoyed this book so much that the next time I go back  to Ohio for a visit, I plan on taking some time to visit that cave where  Mary spent her first winter among the Indians.	2000-03-07
US	51077042	RCCWYG3542AK9	0440411564	21658171	Calico Captive	Books	5	31	33	N	N	A great book.	Elizabeth George Speare's &quot;Calico Captive&quot; might not be as suspenseful as her &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond,&quot; but it is still very good.  As the excellent review from 12/1/99 pointed out, this story is very loosely based on the true captivity narrative of Susannah Johnson.   The focus of the book is on Mrs. Johnson's younger sister, Miriam Willard,  who was just 14 at the time she and her older sister's family were captured  by Abenaki Indians in 1754, but Ms. Speare increased her age to 16.<br />This  book has adventure and romance, and makes for a great fast-paced read.  It  also deals with how cultures and religions clashed on the 18th century  frontier: New England farmers vs. Abenaki warriors, Puritanism vs. Roman  Catholicism, and English vs. French.  A wonderful historical novel for  young readers, and interesting history.	2000-03-01

This book follows a familar plotline: an Indian attack on an isolated frontier cabin, family members brutally slain, a child spared by the attackers, the numbing march into captivity, the hostility and strangeness  of the Indian village, the despair of the captive, the dreams of escape or  ransom, the kindness of a few individual Indians which eases the captive's  loneliness and pain, the gradual acceptance of the new life and family,  becoming a full-fledged member of the tribe in spirit as well as body, and  the eventual return to the whites which is met with reluctance or refusal.   This story has been told before, and very well too, by Lois Lenski in  &quot;Indian Captive&quot; and Sally Keehn in &quot;I am Regina.&quot;  Yet  &quot;Trouble's Daughter&quot; is as good as any other Indian captive  story.<br />No, the story is not unique; but how the characters are developed  within that story is very well-done.  The book is very well-written, and is  a fast-paced read which makes for a real page turner.  The reader will have  a tough time putting this one down. Excellent historical fiction.	2000-03-01

If you want a very detailed study of the battle of Kharkov, told mainly from the Soviet side, complete with orders of battle and a day-by-day retelling of  the battle from the divisional level then this book is for you.<br />I very  much enjoyed Glantz's &quot;Clash of Titans,&quot; which is probably the  best single volume history of the war in the East, and I was hoping this  book would contain more of Glantz's excellent analytical scholarship only  more sharply focused on a single battle.  &quot;Kharkov 1942&quot; is  definetly analytical; but the majority of the book is not original  scholarship.  It's mostly Glantz's translation of a Soviet study of the  battle which explains its very dry style.  Glantz fleshes out some details,  and mentions some parts of the battle that were ignored for political  reasons.  Glantz really does not provide much of his own analysis on the  battle.  Where he does provide analysis is on the Soviet study itself.  &quot;Kharkov 1942&quot; is as much of a study of how lost battles of  &quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot; were viewed within the Soviet political  system as it is a study of the battle itself.	2000-02-26

(My local library had a beat-up, old, hardcover edition.)  As a child I loved stories of white children adopted by the Indians, and I must admit I still find the subject  fascinating.  I loved &quot;Indian Captive&quot; when I first read it as a  child.  I thought it was the best and most realistic look of what it must  have been like to be a captive among the Indians.  No phony heroics or  daring escapes here; just the story of a girl struggling to adapt to life  in a completly alien environment, while at the same time holding onto her  identity.   I remember how disappointed I was when that old, beat-up copy  of it disappeared from the library.<br />&quot;Indian Captive&quot; was one of  the books of my childhood which I never forgot.  I am quite glad to see it  was reprinted.  It finally gave me a chance to re-read it, and it is just  as good as I remember it.  If readers enjoyed this book then they should  take a look at &quot;I Am Regina&quot; by Sally M. Keehn and  &quot;Trouble's Daughter&quot; by Katherine Kirkpatrick.  Like &quot;Indian  Captive,&quot; both of these books are stories about young girls taken  captive by Indians during the colonial period and both are just as well  written and exciting to read as &quot;Indian Captive.&quot; Also for older  readers (12-15), I cannot speak more highly of Conrad Richter's &quot;The  Light in the Forest.&quot;  It is a story of a white boy, who has spent  most of his life among the Indians, forced to return to his white family  who he has forgotten. Mary Jemison found happiness among the Senecas while  still holding onto her identity; the main character in &quot;The Light in  the Forest&quot; has lost all memory of his white past and finds himself  caught between the the claims of blood and loyalty. A darker version of the  story of the Indian captive.  Enjoy.	2000-02-23

Overall, the book is well-written and contains a bunch of great  stories about the individual veterans who fought in the battle.(Albeit  related decades later.)  If you're a fan of Stephen Ambrose's books on WWII  then you will no doubt enjoy this book which is written in a very similar  style.  If you're looking for a David Glantz-like study of the campaign  then you should pass this one by.<br />I should note that the paperback  edition of this book continues to support one of the biggest inaccuracies  of photographic record of the war.  The book claims to show a picture of SS  Lt. Colonel Jochen Pieper- the picture of the cigar smoking SS soldier on  the road to Malmedy.  It has been proven repeatedly that the man in those  pictures is not Peiper.  Yet numerous sources have included those pictures  claiming them to be those of Peiper, and to see a book written in the '90's  still clinging to this inaccuracy is annoying.	2000-02-15

What would happen to the main characters: Will,  Beanpole, and Henry? Will we ever learn more about the Tripods?  And, of  course, will the Tripods ever be defeated?<br />&quot;The City of Gold and  Lead&quot; answers some of these questions.  It explains the Tripods and  how they came to dominate the world and enslave mankind.  It informs us of  the new lives that Will, Beanpole, and Henry have in the White Mountains.   It introduces us to the characters of Fritz and Julius who become major  figures in the struggle against the Tripods.<br />It also answers the question  of the fate of Eloise, the beautiful girl who Will befriended in &quot;The  White Mountains.&quot;  (It is disappointing that the ONLY female  characters of any importance in the entire trilogy are Eloise and her  mother, the Comtesse.)  Personally, my favorite part of the series was  Will's temptation by the good life at the Castle of the Red Tower where he  met Eloise.  In &quot;The White Mountains&quot; Eloise said goodbye to Will  forever because she had been chosen to serve the Tripods in their city and  would remain there as a slave for the rest of her life.  One of main  reasons I felt compelled to read &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; was  to find out what happened to Eloise and would she ever be freed from that  slavery.  The reader will discover the answer to that question at the  Pyramid of Beauty in &quot;The City of Gold and Lead.&quot;<br />Although  &quot;The City of Gold and Lead&quot; answers many questions left from  &quot;The White Mountains,&quot; it also leaves the reader with new  questions about the fate of a major character, the conflict with the  Tripods, and the future of mankind.  There are so many unanswered questions  that most readers will have to read &quot;The Pool of Fire,&quot; which is  the last book of the series, to fully enjoy &quot;The City of Gold and  Lead.&quot;	2000-02-07

It struck me as a combination of &quot;Brave New World,&quot; &quot;1984,&quot; and &quot;The War of the  Worlds&quot; except it is written in an easy to understand prose which is  perfect for younger readers.  I think younger readers will relate to the  main character, Will.  He is not a perfect, hero-type personality.  He can  be self-centered and very selfish at times which makes him quite  believable.  My only complaint about this book is its cover.  One of the  worst covers I have ever seen for any book.  It shows three very modern  looking boys, with their 90's haircuts and clothing, which is odd  considering the novel is set in a primitive society in the 21st century.	2000-02-02

I want to echo the comments made by the other reviewers about this outstanding children's book.  I was introduced to this wonderful book by my 4th grade teacher who read it to my class in 1980.  One would think that a  book written in the 1930's and set on the Hungarian plains in the years  just before WWI would not appeal to &quot;modern&quot; children. Yet the  entire class loved it.  I loved it so much that I later read it several  times on my own.  This book helped instill in me a deep love of reading  which I still have over nineteen years later.<br />A well-deserved winner of  the Newbery Honor Award, &quot;The Good Master&quot; is a forgotten  classic.  Kate Seredy's work is nowhere near as popular with children as  are the works of Blume, Cleary, Dahl, and Wilder.  It's a shame because  &quot;The Good Master&quot; was as good a book as I ever read as a child  and I was also a huge fan of the books of all those other authors.  Jansci  and Cousin Kate from Budapest deserve to be considered along with Peter and  Fudge, Henry, Ramona, and Ribsy, Charlie and Willy Wonka, and the Ingalls  family as among the greatest characters in children's fiction.	2000-01-31

One tragedy is the story of a young German-American girl, Regina.  She witnesses the brutal murders of her father and older brother.  She sees the destruction of her home. She endures a forced march into captivity.  She is seperated from her  beloved sister and is forced to survive in a completely alien and hostile  environment where she is not even allowed to speak in her native tongue.   This is a horrifying story.  A true tragedy.<br />Just as tragic is the story  of the people who caused all the above to happen to this girl.  They  murdered her family, burned her home, forced her to carry a child on her  back, and then attempted to brainwash her into becoming one of them.  Yet  by the end of the book one really sees the Indians as the real tragic  victims of the story.  War, disease, and alcohol, all brought by the  Europeans, completely destroy the entire fabric of their lives. Regina, who  discovers great kindness and love among the Indians, is a witness to both  these tragedies.	2000-01-28

Although I am well past the age this book is intended for, I must say this is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction I have ever read.<br />One of the favorite books of my youth was &quot;Calico Captive&quot; which was also written by Elizabeth George Speare. Recently, in a fit of nostalgia, I purchased &quot;Calico Captive&quot; and, on a whim, I also grabbed  &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot; simply because it was by the same  author and also set in colonial times.  I felt I could use some light,  escapist reading material in order to take a break from my usual heavy fare  of military history books.<br />Anyway I started to read &quot;The Witch of  Blackbird Pond&quot; at around 9:30 in the evening.  At 2AM, I finished it.   I couldn't put it down!  After the first few chapters the book becomes a  real page turner.  I had to find out what would happen next.  Would Kit  ever adapt to the austere life of the Puritans?  How would the situation  with Prudence Cruff pan out?  Would Kit marry William?  Would John marry  the girl he truly loved?  Would Uncle Matthew ever soften?  And, of course,  what would happen if the Puritans found out about Kit's friendship with a  suspected witch?  I was just blown away by this book- one of the enjoyable  reading experiences I have had in a long time.	2000-01-28

She was feared throughout the school as  a very strict, no-nonsense diciplinarian.  She was a teacher of the old  school.  She had mandatory oral book reports and woe to the student who was  not ready.<br />She was fairly open as to what topic the books could be about;  but she did not allow &quot;war&quot; books.  Being a big military history  buff even at age 10, this shrunk my preferences significantly.  She did  offer some recommendations on what was acceptable and prominent was the  name of Beverly Cleary.<br />I went to the library and discovered quite a  collection of Beverly Cleary books.  I picked out &quot;Henry Huggins&quot;  and took it home with me.  I started to read it because I had to do a book  report on something.  As I read I began to enjoy it more and more.  I found  myself laughing at Henry's adventures.  I was hooked.  Every week I took  out another Beverly Cleary book from the library.  Henry, Ribsy, Beezus,  and troublesome Ramona were the topics of most of my book reports.  I would  laugh while I gave my report and soon other students in my class were also  reading Ms. Cleary's works.<br />&quot;Otis Spofford&quot; was different.   Wheras Henry Huggins was just an average boy; Otis Spofford was a class  clown and an instigator.  Otis loved stirring the pot and sometimes his  antics went too far.  As a boy, I could not help but be enthralled by this  wild kid.  It is a very funny book.<br />Among my best friends in grade school  were many of the &quot;non-readers&quot; of my class.  These were the boys  who dreaded being made to read out loud.  The boys who never had a book  report ready when it was their turn.  The boys who got embarrassed by our  old school teacher for not being ready.  These were the boys for whom  Beverly Cleary wrote &quot;Otis Spofford.&quot;<br />I told my friends about  &quot;Otis Spofford.&quot;  And several of them actually read it!  Not only  did they read it, they loved it!  The class must have heard four or five  reports on &quot;Otis Spofford&quot; all by students who were known to  dislike reading.  I think that is as big a compliment for a children's book  as there can possibly be.	2000-01-24

I very much enjoyed Charles MacDonald's account of his travails as the commander of a rifle company in the later stages of the war in Europe.  Although not as jarring or as graphic as some of the accounts by enlisted  men such as EB Sledge, William Manchester, or Guy Sajer, it does show the  burdens of being the person responsible for the lives of such men.<br />One  thing that did stand out was MacDonald's total hostility towards all  Germans not just soldiers.  He feels no sympathy whatsoever for any tragedy  that occured to the German civilians he encountered.  When some of them  request his assistance, he tells them to &quot;Thank, Adolf.&quot; He also  casually describes the killing of prisoners of war.  Although he did not  witness these incidents, there is no doubt that his men murdered POW's and  he does not seem disturbed by it.  Just as disturbing are the references to  relationships between American soldiers and German women.  It seemed that  some of these relationships were not consensual.  The line about a GI  &quot;violently propositioning&quot; a German woman sounded like a  &quot;nicer&quot; way to describe attempted rape.  Most people are familiar  with the mass rapes of German women by the Russians; but what about these  incidents by American soldiers? I have always believed that such incidents  rarely occurred; but MacDonald's book hints that maybe they were not so  rare.<br />MacDonald's attitude towards the Germans is not too shocking  considering that he wrote it right after the war ended.  He spent six  months in hell- cold, hungry, exhausted, and scared.  He was even shot in  the leg during the Battle of the Bulge.  He blamed the German people.  They  allowed that mad man into power.  They supported his war of aggression.   Therefore, they deserved to suffer the consequences, such was MacDonald's  attitude, and my guess it was shared by a large number of American combat  soldiers.	2000-01-19

As a reviewer states above The Little House books are tradionally thought of as &quot;girls books,&quot; but that is a mistaken notion. I cannot agree more. Yes, the copies of the Little House books at my house belonged to my older sister. Yes, the covers of all but one of these books show a girl. Yes, I never saw a boy in my grade school reading a Little House book. And yes, I consider myself a normal guy. Yet one day for some reason I started reading my sister's copy of Little House in the Big Woods. Maybe I read it because it was a tale from the past- I am huge history buff. Maybe I read it because I loved tales of survival in the wilderness. Maybe I was just looking for escapist reading. Whatever the reason I was hooked. I finished Little House in the Big Woods and then quickly devoured the rest of the series.<br />These were NOT &quot;girly&quot; books. Panthers, Indians, grass-hopper storms, bullies who beat up teachers, bears, thieves, blizzards, and other stories from the frontier helped make these books thrilling to a me. Yes, the protaganist is a girl; but what a girl! Laura is no sissy. She is actually quite the tomboy and not too hard for boys to relate to. Laura does become more feminine as she progresses from girlhood to being a young woman; but to a boy reader who had followed her adventures from Wisconsin onwards it was not too hard to still enjoy the later books in the series.<br />I have read and re-read these books numerous times. They are just terrific escapist entertainment. When I want to temporarily forget any troubles, I will occasionally return to the Little House books. They really have the uncanny ability to take the reader back to a more innocent and simpler time yet one also of great hardship, peril, and adventure. Terrific books for girls and BOYS!	2000-01-12

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	3	87	102	N	N	A very well written book by a very mediocre historian.	Whether you loved the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or hated it, there is no doubt that it had a major cultural impact in reviving public interest in WWII.  As a huge military history buff, I have not seen such a  wonderful cornucopia of new and re-released books on a single subject,  WWII, since the big Civil War craze that followed the success of Ken Burns'  documentary.<br />Like that Civil War craze, the current popular interest in  WWII has seen the release of some truly great books, some mediocre ones,  and just plain wasted pulp.  &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot; fits somewhere in  between great and mediocre.  It is well-written, has some terrific stories,  and provides a nice introduction to people who are new to the field of  military history.<br />The problem with the book is Ambrose.  Ambrose has  become the unofficial &quot;WWII expert&quot; in American popular culture.  His name will be seen on the forwards of new WWII books.  His face and  pleasant voice used for documentaries or interviews.  He has, in fact,  become the WWII equivilent to the Civil War craze's Shelby Foote.  Ambrose  is a good writer; but an average historian.  &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;  is nothing more than a collection of secondary source material and the  recollections of old veterans.  Interesting reading to be sure; but lazily  researched history.  Also Ambrose's jingoism and hero worship(especially of  Eisenhower which is seen in virtually all of his WWII books) can get a  little tiresome, especially knowing that he is a professional historian and  not a novelist turned amateur historian like Foote.  If a reader really  wants to know what it was like to be a combat soldier in the ETO check out  &quot;Company Commander&quot; by Charles MacDonald or &quot;The Clay  Pigeons of St. Lo&quot; by Glover Johns.  Both of these books were written  by combat veterans less than five years after the war.  Also both were used  heavily as source material for &quot;Citizen Soldiers.&quot;Johns' book  is, unfortunatly, out of print, but available through many libraries.   MacDonald's book, though, was just recently reprinted- thank you, Steven  Speilberg.	2000-01-11

I was in my grade school library when I spotted the cover- two young, lean, armed Indians with mohawk haircuts walking through an impressionistic  forest with a beam of light descending upon them.  One Indian was entirely  red, the other all white.  I read the back cover.  It was about a white  captive among the Indians.  I loved that subject as age ten and the book  was my choice from the library that day.   I must admit that it was tough  going the first time I read it.  It was sometimes hard to understand about  whom he was referring to when True Son thought about his father and the  book did lack action.  I also admit that the ending was a let down.  I  wanted a cut and dried ending with no loose ends and LITF leaves the reader  with a huge loose end.  At ten years old, this book left me disappointed  and confused.<br />Yet I voluntarily read it again not less than two years  later and I fell in love with it the second time.  I have since then read  it at least once every year and sometimes more.  I am 29 now.  I cannot  adequately describe why this novel still moves me.  I can say it is  beautifully written and has a truly moving story about a boy caught between  two very different worlds.  Also Richter's description of the beauty of  nature and the way people can see the same facets of nature and of mankind  in two completly different ways is incredible.  I could go on and on why  this novel means so much to me, but I will state simply that it is my all  time favorite.	2000-01-10
