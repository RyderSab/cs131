US	31407817	RXZTXA9JOCIRD	0440126894	501621906	Full Circle	Books	1	2	4	N	N	This one was painful...	I read some of the reviews from this book, and they told me that if i could get through half the book, I'd be hooked.<BR>Well, unfortunatly, I was bored stiff the whole time.<br />The book starts out in the early 1940's when a woman Jean and her husband are so very much in love and concive a baby, and her husband ends up having to go to war, and dies. Jean gives birth to her daughter Tana, who is the main character in this book. <BR>Tana grows up having very different political views and dating various men.  Her mother Jean wants her to just marry and have children, while Tana wants to go and make something of her life. So she enrolls in school, meets this black girl named Sharon, and these were the time when there was still very heavey racisism.  IT just goes on and on and on about everything, and nothing fun to read.  She meets this man Named Harry Windslow, who is her best friend, and then Tana starts dating his dad, and all these other losers.  And it just really gets me how she falls \\"so in love\\" with all these people, and she hardley knows them.<br />The only reason i even finished this book was to give this review.  It was a very boring read, and i would not read it again.  I got the impression that Tana was a very rude girl to her mother, and that she just didnt give a damn about anything but herself.  Oh poor me..waah waah waah...I got raped...please pity me.<BR>I dont know, maybe thats just me.  This book got really good reviews from everyone else who read it..but i was just bored stiff out of my mind the whole time.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.  <br />You want a good book to read on the Weekends?  Read D.S's Star, Malice, Changes, and Once in a Lifetime.<BR>  Good reading.	2003-08-11
