The story was great, new characters were involved,I loved the idea of having found Gregori's lost brother (Darius) and sister (Desari). The love between Julian and Desari was wonderful, after suffering for centuries being alone, isolated and carrying the dark shadow within him he finally sees the light, Desari was a good match with her enchanting voice and powers. What touched my heart was the \\"family unit\\" how they had survived all these centuries staying together under the protection of Darius. I hope there would be a story on Darius, he certainly got me curious. I couldn't help but wonder if there would be a story on Gabriel and Lucian i think it would be great.I loved the tension between the new introduced charaters, Barack and Syndil.
