I had hoped to learn a bit more about Bono and what really makes him tick.  As I described to a friend of mine this morning, I don't know much more about him than I already knew.  If you keep up with the articles in the press and on the major fan sites, you already know most of this.  There's nothing here that hasn't been said or read before. <br /> <br />I wasn't looking for intimate details, but perhaps more about what it was like growing up (he claims to have no childhood memories) and insight into being in the band (we don't get much here either).  Nothing terribly profound on his relationships with the bandmates or his friends and family, again, that we hadn't already read before.  All you really get is numerous pages on his thoughts on religion and world affairs with a spattering of namedropping thrown in. <br /> <br />For a book \\"sanctioned\\" by Bono, I guess I should have expected no real surprises.  The Q&A format is great but tends not to be very focused and it's hard to keep track chronologically of when conversations occurred and what was going on at the time. <br /> <br />By all means, add this to your collection, but temper your expectations!	2005-07-06

I considered it a tremendous find to see this book peeking out at me in Duty Free at Heathrow Airport on my way home from Europe recently.  I've been such a fan of Boris Starling since Messiah, and have been hoping, nay, praying, for another page turner.  Sadly, Vodka is not it.<br />At just over 500 pages, Starling takes too long to tell the story, or stories, as there are multiple here and sometimes  you wonder if it is indeed worth the effort of keeping up with them.  While the background on the vodka industry and the mechanics of business and mafia in Russia were interesting enough, only the last 75 pages or so had the type of suspense we would hope for from Starling and the ending was a bit too pat for me.  The &quot;killings&quot; were too few and far between for a book 500 pages long...I just never felt there was much of a threat there, although the story behind them was a bit of a surprise.<br />Easily, this could've been told quicker and more effortlessly by Starling.  I won't give up on him though, I'm already waiting for his next.	2004-05-09

I am a big Michelangelo fan to begin with, and the idea of reading something written by a contemporary and aficionado of his was intriguing.  I was well rewarded for my interests.<br />Vasari clearly idolized Michelangeo and Raphael.  That is apparent, but as he did for every other artist's Life he covered, the level of personal detail and anecdotes is invaluable for someone like me looking for the story behind the artists.  Artists from each phase of the Renaissance are covered with detail of both their personal and artistic lives.  I can say I learned so much from each chapter that I will surely be taking this book with me for reference when I am in Florence.<br />One caveat, I think it would be helpful to have a book with photographs of the works Vasari discusses.  Unless you are already up to speed on the major Renaissance works, it is more helpful to visualize them with the assistance of Vasari's descriptions.  I found myself running to the internet often to see what he had been talking about.<br />Kick back and relax with this very easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable guide to some of the Renaissance's finest artists.	2003-01-20

As others have said, the Sicilian way of life is well-presented, as are various Italian and Italy references that may be lost on someone who isn't familiar with either (glossary in the back).  But for the most part, you can get by not knowing exactly all of it.<br />There's no way you can't know what \\"Shape of Water\\" means if you have read the book...it's defined in a conversation between two central characters.  To disclose it here would ruin the storyline.<br />Having read many European authors, I can see why this author is all the rage in Europe.  Book Magazine rated this one of the best mysteries of 2002, and I tend to agree.  My only complaints are that it was too short, and too fast of a read!	2002-11-22

I was puzzled with this story because it seemed to me that the author up and moved to Venice to marry a man she knew (barely) peripherally.  It wasn't like they'd had a long distance romance for years...and then decided to marry.  They met, visited each other a couple times.  Then once she's living with him, she is frustrated with the adjustment and his foreign (to her) ways and continues to call him &quot;the stranger&quot; even after they are married!  It seemed too whimsical and I couldn't really feel bad for her frustrations given that she went into this pretty blindly.  What did interest me was her in depth knowledge of Venice itself, which I'm sure she could've delved deeper into and provided us with more tidbits the average tourist wouldn't uncover.  I also appreciated her detail of the Italian culture (ie: wedding plans, renovating the house, the moving process).  I won't say I wouldn't recommend the book because I do feel there's an audience for it, I just won't be giving my copy out freely and endorsing it as the read of the summer.	2002-08-09

Rather than rehash the plot for you, I will just say what I got out of it.  I could not have been more surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  \\"Luminous, brilliant, astounding...\\" are not overstatements.  I felt the whole book had a glow to it, and this reader, far from a mushy book lover, not a chick-flick type of girl, fell hard for this book (For the record, I'm a Roddy Doyle, Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan fan, so this is out of my usual author pool!).  I could barely put Lovely Bones down for two days long enough to reapply sunscreen.  There are so many thought-provoking angles to this story.  The exploration of the different family relationships, the adolescent realtionships and of perceptions of death and heaven made me think, but not in a depressing or morbid sort of way.  This is such a wonderfully, beautifully written story that I can't say enough about it.  Highly recommended.	2002-07-16
US	53074133	R2AZTAL5VAFRED	0452282152	858318999	Girl with a Pearl Earring: A Novel	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A very satisfying story	I read this back-to-back with Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland.  I loved Vreeland's book and loved this as well, but do not confuse the two; they are very different books written in different styles.  All they have in common is a Vermeer painting.<br />Girl With a Pearl Earrings presents a fictional account of how this particular Vermeer came to be.  Griet, a young maid of little means, lives with Vermeer's ever-growing family.  A bond of sorts develops between artist and maid, and she becomes the subject of his painting, which goes against conventions, social mores and the wishes of Vermeers wife.<br />There are many surprising little incidents and twists to the story, which I hesitate to outline here.  But suffice to say I found the resolution of the story to be extremely satisifying on Griet's behalf.  Chevalier so clearly depicts Delft in her writing that I can easily envision it in my own mind.  I felt the story was well developed and had a very tight, well-rounded plot.  The majority of the characters are either likable or dislikable...particularly one child, Cornelia, Catharina Vermeer and Pieter the son.<br />I recommend this as well as Vreeland's book.  I also would not discourage reading them together...one complements the other quite well.	2001-03-13

You know how it is, sometimes nothing on your usual book menu really works for you.  I had turned to biographies and historical novels to break me of the rut.  I picked this up last week on a whim, having passed it by many times before.  I read it in exactly two sittings, and just highly recommended it to two of my closest bibliophile friends.  This was just a delight to read!<br />Vreeland has designed the book as a series of short-stories which all trace back the history of a 36th Vermeer painting.  (It is held that Vermeer painted only 35, and this 36th is of Vreeland's creation).  What I found most interesting about the individual stories is how well Vreeland depicted the difference in value, both emotional and monetary, the painting had for its different owners over the years.  For some, the painting was priceless and something to be coveted or hidden or cherished for familial or emotional reasons.  For others, including the painter and his family, the painting was worth food and survival.<br />In addition, I came to &quot;see&quot; the painting more clearly with each passing chapter, as I came to know how the painting was seen by its owners and how their feelings towards it affected me.  I have much to think about now that I can digest the painting's chain of ownership in total.<br />I was entranced by the atmosphere of the Dutch regions in which Vreeland set the stories.  This book has a definite feel to it, and it is mesmerizing; you will have trouble putting the book down.  Not a bad way to break out of my rut!	2001-03-06

It turned out to be an excellent choice.<br />Set in pre-WWII Paris, Watkins' story introduces the reader to some very vivid characters:  David, a young American out to fulfill a dream of painting in Paris; Pankratov, a disgruntled russian master painter; Dietrich, a strong-headed henchman of Hitler's; Fleury, a shady art dealer.  What David gets into is more than he bargained for, but certainly a life experience.  As the Germans advanced, the French began an effort to protect certain works of art from being absconded by the Germans.  Part of the project involved reclaiming certain works from the Germans by trading forgeries of masterpieces for them.  This is where David comes in, with the help of Pankratov's experience and Fleury's promotion.<br />This book has everything...good pacing, strongly developed characters, excellent setting.  I could see, smell and feel Paris at the time.  I wanted to cry for Pankratov and his daughter, get mad at the Germans and cheer David on.  I was actually mentally tired when the story ended, having gotten so worked up in the conclusion.<br />Watkins obviously researched art and the &quot;art&quot; of forgery.  While I enjoy art, I never really gave much thought to what went on at the time with respect to the paintings and works taken by the Germans.  This is a fabulous read.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-19

If you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and go read Messiah first.  And then pick up Storm.  You won't be disappointed.  (You might also want the background of Messiah that is referred to repeatedly in Storm.)<br />Boris Starling returns with his second novel.  Again, he deals with a deranged serial killer who is quite elusive.  This time around, Kate Beauchamp is our detective and Starling gets into her mind smartly. Here, Starling weaves a story with two tragedies, the sinking of a ferry Kate was on, and the serial murders.  At first it seems crazy to follow the two so closely, but the many ties, beginning with Kate's father and friends, between the two produce a tightly woven tale.  Starling also gets inside the head of this young woman, particularly with her mental and emotional reactions toward the sinking and the killings.<br />What I like about both this and Messiah is the thought and story behind the serial killers.  They are not &quot;run of the mill&quot; psycho stories.  Without giving much more away, I will say they are more than thought provoking.  In addition, the stories themselves are so addictive that I found myself, like I did with Messiah, wondering which of the many characters the killer could be, and I was stuck with 150 pages left with nothing to do but sit down and hurry through it to find out.  I was not disappointed, and absolutely surprised with the many twists this took.<br />With plot and decent character development like this, who needs much more in a good thriller?	2000-11-29

That was indeed interesting.  But with the exception of a few tidbits that I hadn't already heard (Jenna's video from home made it a day late, but they didn't give it to her; Jenna verbally attacked Jeff for not getting a video; Kelley's two-faced behavior was better depicted in print than it was on tv) there wasn't much to offer here.  I had heard that there was much  more to the last tribal council than what we saw, and the book promised in-depth expanded coverage of it, but there was actually less discussion of it in the book than I already knew.  And not every challenge is discussed, including the few challenges we never go to see at all.<br />In addition, this book is riddled with typos and grammatical flaws (if I had to read &quot;I and the crew&quot; instead of &quot;the crew and I&quot; one more time...) which just drove me to distraction.  Perhaps there was a rush to print this?  <br />I guess this will have to satisfy me anyway until Survivor II.<br />All in all, this was a lightning fast, interesting read from the point of view of simple production facts, but otherwise, a disappointment for those of us looking for more juicy information than we already know.	2000-09-20

Imagine, taking someone up on a bet to hitchhike around Ireland with a  dorm-sized fridge, then writing a book about your exploits of fulfilling  the terms of the bet.  Tony Hawks did it, and here we have the fruits of  his efforts.<br />From the beginning, he admits that it's a frivolous  idea....but I think that's what makes it that much more interesting.  In 30  days, Tony works his way around the perimeter of Ireland with the fridge on  a dolly.  We get to read of his encounters with various Irish, English and  Americans who help him reach his goal.  We see how the fridge becomes more  of a celebrity than Tony (an ego-reducing reality!) and how people banded  together behind this crazy idea.<br />I have traveled extensively in Ireland,  and while some of the incidents and reactions may seem a bit over the top  or overly charitable, I can believe that they happened.  I haven't read a  travelogue that more fully captures the true heart, spirit and imagination  of Ireland better than this.<br />Bravo to Tony for completing the task...and  for letting us accompany him on his journey.	2000-07-10
US	53074133	RTCOE75UFTFGD	076790415X	374953865	Spanish Lessons: Beginning a New Life in Spain	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A very enjoyable, informative read	I am not a big fan of the travel memoir, of any sort.  I read this only because I have become increasingly interested in traveling to Spain and wanted to read something fairly recent which deals with Spanish  culture.<br />I am quite surprised by the previous review.  Perhaps I'm a bit  more open minded, but I never caught a glimpse of the author's  &quot;imperialist attitudes.&quot;  The only instances that _may_ have been  interpreted as such were when Lambert was expressing distrust of locals he  had just met...but who wouldn't?  One fellow in particular had a habit of  either not being fully forthcoming or bending the truth a bit.  If this is  one of the first people you meet, I would expect that you might be leery as  well!<br />I think one of the strong points of this man's story is that he  moved to a country and had to work at adjusting and allowing those around  him to adjust to him.  He said that they would try leaving in Spain for a  year, then weigh out whether they had adapted AND were accepted by the  locals.  Only then would they decide whether to stay or not.  Along the  way, Lambert describes the many obstacles and cultural faux pas which he  encountered making his dream of living in Spain come true.<br />By reading  this book with an open mind, I think that it is apparent by the outcome of  the many subplots (particularly those having to do with Lambert's  relationship with the workmen doing the construction and upkeep on the  house) that Lambert and his wife were accepted after working at it for a  year.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those interested in  Spanish culture away from the sangria and the flamenco, or those eager to  learn more about breaking in to another culture.  Very educational.	2000-06-26

It has been some time since I've been so moved by a story such as this.<br />The character development in MCS is stunning.  I really felt that I knew Kiyoki  personally, and suffered along with him as he strove to find himself.  Many  times, I found myself cheering him on, hoping for the best, and celebrating  his joy and sorrow.<br />I found the familial history not only to be critical  to the plotline, but wonderfully presented in well-designed flashback  chapters which segued well with the main story.  In addition, Richman  clearly knew her subject matter to have been able to evoke such images of  Japan in the late 1800s.  Her descriptions brought to mind many colorful  and vivid images...to the point where many times in the quiet of my rooms I  could hear sandals sliding across rough floors.<br />I highly recommend this  story.  It only took me 3 days to read, I could hardly put it down.  And  that hasn't happened in quite some time!	2000-03-14

Everything you liked about the first book is back for the second.<br />As with Bridget Jones' Diary, I found myself laughing at myself through Bridget.  She does and says many of the  same things I do or say regularly, particularly in the 30-something  singleton's pursuit of man.  This is one book that will have you chuckling  out loud.<br />I found the characters in this sequel better drawn.  Fielding  really gives life to Bridget's mom (who is QUITE a character) and her  friends Jude and Shazzer.  Fielding makes sure we still don't really care  for Mark Darcy (why DID she take him back? ) and that we cringe at  Bridget's boss.  The interview with the actor who plays Mark Darcy is  downright hilarious....I could only hope to be as funny!<br />While I did  enjoy The Edge of Reason as I did the original, I will say that this one  seemed to drag on in one particular spot, specifically the Thailand  holiday.  Had that whole section not been included, I'd say we have a  winner.  With the excursion out of London, this one goes on just a little  too long.  I can't decide if I was happy that Bridget goes home for her  sake or mine!<br />Overall though, this is another fun and funny piece by  Helen Fielding.  One can only wonder if Bridget is up for a third go!	2000-02-29

The chocolate descriptions were so detailed and so true-to-life that I beg you not to read it if you're even remotely hungry  (I suffered from too many cabinet raids because of this book!).  I thought  the chocolate was a wonderful character in and of itself.  It was used to  twist the story and was as much of a player as any of the human  characters.<br />The interpersonal plots were well-written and I found all of  the characters human, as though I could easily pick them out of a crowd.   Ms. Harris does a wonderful job of creating sympathetic characters....there  wasn't one I didn't feel for at some stage during the story, even the  priest!<br />While I was hesitant of the idea of Vianne changing the  complexion of a small town with the help of her chocolate, I found myself  becoming just as transfixed with her shop as the townspeople were.  This  was a very enjoyable read!	2000-02-10

Simply written with the simplest of plots, this book captivated me from the first page.<br />The story of a snake charmer who surprisingly finds fame but at the price of deep personal loss, this story had me reexamining priorities in light of the charmer's fates.  Is fame  more important than love?  More important than being able to continue work  you love?  Success at what cost?  Is it more important than family?  And  the charmer's less-than-stellar morality leads to questions of spousal and  familial loyalty while exploring &quot;true love.&quot;  Following the  charmer as he searches for his answers only adds to these questions.<br />It's  been a long time since I've read such a good story with so many thought  provoking issues.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's not intended to be  such a profound book, but it certainly has caused me to take pause and  reevaluate things.<br />I highly, highly recommend this book.  Enjoy!	2000-01-27

It is written extremely well.  Schwartz does not overindulge in descriptives, but gives us just enough to picture the scene or experience the same feelings.  I did not  find it depressing, as storylines like this sometimes tend to  be.<br />Schwartz's characters, in particular, are finely drawn.  I agree with  a previous reviewer that it was particularly helpful to have both Ethan and  Dwight's stories told in the first person as it helped to get more inside  their heads, and also it helped to better develop the plot.  I would have  liked to have gotten more from Grace, but I think that that would have  detracted from one of the main themes, which was two fathers doing whatever  they had to preserve or save their relationships with their sons.  Both are  dealing with different degrees of guilt, remorse and loss for different  reasons, but when it comes down to it in the end, both are struggling with  the same emotions.  One character that was particularly effective and an  excellent barometer of the family's grief was Emma and I wish she'd been  included a little more.<br />I have to disagree with an earlier reviewer that  the ending was disappointing.  I felt that based on what we got to know of  Ethan, there really was no other way to end it.  Without giving anything  away, I think that if he had done anything else, it would have been  uncharacteristic of him, and as he said, &quot;what difference would it  make&quot; -- his son was gone regardless.<br />I highly recommend this book  for its thought-provoking emotional content.  I haven't been able to put it  out of my mind since I finished it.	2000-01-23

After my horrendous read of The Pilot's Wife, I swore off Anita Shreve.  But my mom, a Shreve fan, loaned me this one, promising it would be different.<br />As one rekindling a long-lost love, I can say that a lot of  the emotions and thoughts were bang on.  I couldn't believe how well she  evoked the same feelings I am having myself as I revisit this love.  But  WHY, OH WHY did she have to end it the way she did?  (Now I wonder why Mom  told me to read this knowing my situation...is she trying to get at  something? )<br />I felt the same sort of apathy for the characters as I did  in The Pilot's Wife, and here again, I couldn't believe what they did to  each other and themselves.  This time I vow this is my last Shreve  book!<br />Three stars for getting the emotions rights...otherwise a bust!	1999-12-11

I was not disappointed.  I was hooked from the start, and loved Doyle's  interpretation of &quot;Mick&quot; Collins, Connolly and other big names of  the Revolution.  As usual, Doyle brings his characters alive, but here, he  skillfully interweaves them with equally vivid real-life figures.  This is  certainly a departure from any of his previous works, and I agree  wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer who aptly summed up which Doyle  books to read depending on what you're looking to get out of  them.<br />However, the one caveat I offer is that I find that this will be a  hard book to wholeheartedly recommend to even my most diehard  literature-reading friends, as I believe it requires more than a  fundamental knowledge of Irish history to fully appreciate the story.  I  think that a lot of meaning and irony (like waiting for the IRA to put down  its arms before sitting down to talk peace) might be lost on readers not  following the twists and turns of Irish history.<br />The novel finished with  quite a crescendo, and I look forward to following Henry onward!	1999-09-28

I flew through this book in about 4 hours, it was that enjoyable for me.  I loved the Perfect Storm, and while I understand that this is not intended to be a sequel or follow-up to the Perfect Storm, it is most certainly a  perfect companion to it.<br />It's clear that Ms. Greenlaw is an English  major, because I felt for the most part that her story was better written.   Her explanations showed a more &quot;hands on&quot; knowledge of the  profession.  And while this book didn't have the intensity of the situation  set forth in the Perfect Storm, I still wanted to get right to the end to  see how the trip turned out.  Alternating chapters with the story of this  one particular trip and &quot;Mug Ups&quot; was a great tactic, and one  that made sense, as opposed to interspersing unrelated anecdotes within the  main story.<br />This was a wondeful, entertaining read.	1999-09-14

Done right, it will have the same sort of humor that Trainspotting or the Roddy Doyle trilogy (The Commitments/The Snapper/The Van) had when they were  transitioned to film. Some of the scenes are just screaming to be played  out on screen!<br />It did take a bit to get used to the language, but I felt  that Warner captured the essence of Scottish schoolgirls pretty well, and  the venture to the big city (Edinburgh, obviously) brought back some  memories of my own.  This did convince me that I need to check out his  other books.  This one had a few laugh out loud moments, but also presented  the interrelationships of this group of girls splendidly.	1999-08-29

The chapters that detail the storm and the loss of Chaplin's lover are haunting  and mesmerizing.  I could not put this book down, for some reason, and read  the last 150 pages in one sitting.  My only remaining thoughts are how did  he recover from this disaster and what would I have done is similar  circumstances?<br />There are weak spots, however.  I don't understand why he  felt it necessary to relive his infidelities.  I don't see what this added  to the story (other than to cement in our minds one of their many arguments  which he usually tended to incite) and what purpose it served other than as  a confession for him.  I expect that he is living with quite a bit of  guilt, that of his lover's death, his infidelities, his frequent denials of  the worries of his lover, and the chronic &quot;what ifs&quot; that must  now haunt him.<br />The thoughts and questions that linger upon finishing Dark  Wind are many.  I recommend this not because it is sterling literature or  has a deep plot (because it is not and does not), but it brings up many  issues that are worth thinking about.	1999-08-01

There is a fairly good plotline, well-developed characters and actually a bit of suspense (will she?  won't she?).<br />Being a single 20-something, I found I could relate to  Diana somewhat, and her predicament twinged my sympathies.  While not on  the same level as &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; (my summer 1998 fave beach  read) either comedically or overall, this is still a fun, consistent story.	1999-07-30

In FLOL, we got caught up in the characters and their swirling emotions.  We willed them together and our hearts beat with theirs, in good times and in  bad.<br />Here, however, we're left floating in a sea of religious portents  and omens, all the while suffering from rubber mallets with  &quot;FATE&quot; labeled on them hitting us over the head.  This story is  more concerned with dealing with religious beliefs, overtones and  overly-strained coincidences to even attempt to approach the characters  properly.  I got through the entire book thinking I didn't know the  characters any better than when I'd picked them up.  When the male lead  falls in love, we read, literally, &quot;he is in love.&quot;  This was a  might bit too painful to me.<br />There is quite a sense of small town Ireland  community here, but we don't get to know many or any of the peripheral  characters well enough, and I found that using them sparingly distracted me  from an already weak story progression.<br />I wanted to love this book, and  walked away barely liking it.  Niall has done better, and I hope he  rediscovers his way with attempt #3.	1999-07-30

This book had me laughing and remembering the memories of people and faces I have of northside Dublin, much in the way Roddy Doyle did with his Barrytown  Trilogy.  How true to reality this story is.  He has accurately portrayed  family life in Dublin, at least as I've seen it.  In addition, O'Carroll  had a delicious plot that really captured my heart.  I'm off now to find  books two and three in the series.  Until then, I just may read The Mammy  again.	1999-07-30
US	53074133	R1Y0K2JWUCFKS2	0446604534	75967530	Day of Confession	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Not as exciting as hoped	It must be difficult for an author to spill his plotline in the early pages of a 650+ page book and then have to drag the reader (kicking and screaming) through the rest of the book to get us to the point where the  characters figure out what is going on.  This, in my opinion, is torture  for the reader!  I believe that this plot would have worked much better if  it was kept hidden from the reader in the end, and revealed as a part of  the 100+ page climax.  It was almost painful for me to know the whole story  and not just want to end it about 300 pages earlier.  Waiting for everyone  in the story to figure it out was not the suspense I was looking for.  I  wanted to be one of the ones who didn't know!  (And shame on those who post  the plotline in their reviews, too!)<br />The last 100 pages or so, in which  the entire story comes to a head, would make a brilliant book  on its own,  given the proper lead in.  This part of the story was so well-written, I  HAD to give the book 3 stars based on that alone.  Without giving the  ending away, the type of creativity and suspense in the last chapters is  what should've carried this book through the first 500+ pages.<br />These  characters felt flat to me...and none of the relationships, outside of that  between Father Daniel and the Cardinal he was so loyal to, were written to  seem genuine.<br />There was no zinger to leave you breathless here as there  was in Day After Tomorrow.  Not that I expected one, but the end just ended  as you would hope it would after struggling through the previous  chapters.<br />And for those readers who say this book makes them wonder about  the Vatican and those working in it...c'mon, it's fiction, folks!  For some  facts, read &quot;When In Rome,&quot; a true story written by Robert  Hutchinson, I believe, who got behind the Vatican walls to do some research  on how it's run.	1999-07-06

This seems to be the best for the &quot;common-man&quot; trip to Paris. The information is very practical, honest and concise.  Rick knows what is possible and worthwhile in Paris,  and clearly sets it forth here.  Rick is not trying to cram every last  detail into a guide, but rather includes the more significant sites as well  as the &quot;back doors&quot; he's well-known for finding.  In addition,  this guide is so readable, it reads more like a (sometimes tongue-in-cheek)  travel narrative than ordinary travel guides (that often read like history  texts!)<br />Included are some great tips on how to avoid lines and crowds as  best you can, great opening times and days of all sites; logical, detailed  walking tours; and hints on where clean and convenient restrooms are!  What  more do you need?  While the others (Fodors, Frommers) focus on what is the  best regardless of cost, Rick uncovers some gems that others may never find  on their own, and lets us know that they are good and less expensive while  helping us logically &quot;attack&quot; Paris as a tourist!  This book is  WELL worth the money!	1999-02-22

I am now about to try another, only because I hope that what I'd heard is right, and that his previous work is more accomplished!<br />This is a quick and interesting read.   It has a good plot, yet the character development felt shallow to me.  I  never really felt like I was being drawn into the story, but rather a  distant observer.  I didn't sympathize with anyone, but read the book to  find out what happened.  I will try another by him to confirm that he's  Booker-worthy for previous works!	1999-01-04

There's the cheating  wife, scorned husband, and psycho fall guy, along with a murder to be  solved and the dizzying loop to cover it up, and a few unexpected but not  surprising twists. Nothing too unpredictable, but an enjoyable journey from  start to finish.<br />Abrahams paces this story well.  I didn't find it  lagging at all.  My one complaint would be a somewhat lame  tie-up-loose-ends finish in the last 2 or 3 pages, but overall I felt this  was an enjoyable story, and would've been an excellent summer read.  You  could easily categorize this as a beach book.	1998-09-20

But never have I been so pleasantly surprised.<br />I will spare descriptions of the plot, as it is covered amply by the reviews above, other than to say that it has everything: love, interracial stress, friendship, incest, divorce, drugs, sex....but all in such manageable portions and not presented in a way to overwhelm the reader.  This is such a tightly woven story that flows so well that it is one of the few books of late that have been an extreme pleasure to read.  I agree with another reader that it ended much too soon!<br />McCann has the same strong and effective word usage, plot and character development of both Doyle and McCabe.  The research that was done was evident throughout; speech patterns and descriptions (particularly of both the tunnel and skyscraper constructions) seemed realistic and believable.<br />I highly recommend This Side of Brightness, and look forward to McCann's next while I go back to read McCann's previous works.	1998-08-07

Fortunately for the reader, the story does not suffer from overindulgence in mere historical fact, as there are plenty of extremely personal anecdotes which keep the story moving at an even pace.<br />It is amazing that Elgin (barely) made it through this escapade alive, and more so that he didn't make a dime from &quot;acquiring&quot; antiquities from ancient cultures which, in his opinion, could neither appreciate nor adequately tend to these treasures.  That the battle to possess the marbles continues to this day is testament to the passions of the people involved.<br />My one complaint with the book as a whole was the last chapter, entitled &quot;The Trial.&quot;  Don't let it fool you, Elgin wasn't brought to trial for theft, as he should have been.  The trial in question is that of his wife's lover, on trial for adultery.  I found the inclusion of this rather!  lengthy chapter not pertinent to the story of the marbles; it would've ended the book just as well to merely point out the financial losses Elgin suffered without the detail of the trial.  Otherwise, this is well written and an educational read.	1998-07-21

This story was mesmerizing and well-developed.  Carey's use of first and third person is excellent, and she captures the voices of the three generations appropriately, as well as weaving a well-conceived story of two mother-daughter and one grandmother-grandaughter relationships.<br />The author's love of Ireland is obvious, and for me as another aficionado, I found her tone and use of Irish dialect and description added to the magical feel of the book.  She's captured the west of Ireland in a mere 257 pages.<br />Excellent first novel, and one that leaves us clamoring for the next.	1998-07-05
US	53074133	R1IAJFIPZJ250S	0786863986	713265752	A Monk Swimming	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Blarney taken much too far	I had expected something much better.  Malachy McCourt certainly has the gift of the gab, and excessive gab it is.  A Monk Swimming seems to be nothing more than a bunch of locker room talk taken a bit too far, or rather, chatter overheard in one of the many pubs and barrooms the reader is forced to frequent repeatedly with McCourt.  In the first half of the book, McCourt's name dropping and resulting egocentrism lends the reader to view him as nothing more than a hanger-on in a social circle he stumbled into. His excessive verbosity (irony intended) is tiring and makes this a tremendously tedious read in spots.  For much better writing, stick to the italicized passages at the beginning of some chapters, and particularly the last two pages; they are more cohesive and better developed than the rest of the book as a whole and don't subject the reader to juvenile anecdotes or repeated displays of immaturity and irresponsibility.  There is only so much money-borrowing, drinking and reliance on others for employment I can stand!  Freeloading at its finest is the best description I can come up with.<br />I was surprised that the stories of McCourt's exploits truly underscore the stereotypical (and in my opinion, incorrect) view of the Irish immigrant to America, sadly enough.  The womanizing, drinking, financial instability and irresponsibility are not typical, and should not be treated as lightly as they were here.<br />After reading this book, I see nothing that I would've been proud to include in my memoirs.  In the years covered by this book, McCourt doesn't do much better than his father did, including drinking himself silly, abandoning his innocent offspring and wife and holding down fly-by-night jobs.  Maybe I did miss the point here, because I found this a rather embarassing read.	1998-07-05

The presentation however, was a bit confusing.  I didn't feel that his use of names was consistent (forever switching between first and last) and that the science of climbing was explained well enough (a better example of thorough explanation is found in Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm).  I felt as though Krakauer assumed the reader has a certain knowledge base going in to the book, both about climbing and the Sherpas.  It is surprising how little he did in rescuing the people stranded, and how it was hardly explained, yet he does seem to point out weakenesses in others' stories, even when those others were attempting to rescue stranded climbers.  Also, there was little explanation as to the mindset of the climbers, and why they would want to do this, what the motivation was.  My final nit with this book was that I felt this was more a confessional than a literary outlet...but the author admits that early on in the foreward, so the reader should be prepared for at-times-annoying self-absorption.  Other than these points, I did enjoy the book, and read it in record time, but I wouldn't rush to read another by him (I was greatly disappointed by Into the Wild, which turned me off to ITA for so long).  See the IMAX presentation, which puts this all into much needed perspective!	1998-06-30

Bridget Jones's Diary is an excellent beach or pool read.

I read this on my return from my first trip to London, so much of the geography meant something to me.  The premise behind this book, assorted individuals taking on London on their own for their own reasons, is great.  The switching between and intermingling of characters is well-done.  There's some dark comedy here.  Mick is quite a charcter, in both the literary and comedic sense.  The ending was a shocker...who would've thought!  If you find it, pick it up...Bleeding London is thoroughly entertaining.	1998-04-17

The problem with following up a largely successful second novel is that whatever follows will be compared to it until novel number three comes along to set the record straight.  I'm guilty as charged for comparing #2 to #1.  I loved The Notebook and was captured heart and soul by its emotion and sincerity.  I *believed* it. Message in a Bottle, to me, was a quick, enjoyable read.  I wanted to keep reading it just to find out how it would progress.  Yet, I found it predictable (of course when she tracks him down this total stranger who's message she found in a bottle on a beach, they'll fall madly in love) and unbelievable (would one really travel 1000 miles and have such luck finding someone who's first name is the only thing one knows about them?) I guess I am a romantic, which is why the ending surprised, disappointed and satisfied (yes, both disappointed and satisfied, in that order) me.  This did not end all neat and tidy as a diehard romantic would hope and come to expect.  I didn't experience the emotional draining that The Notebook caused me, but I'll recommend MIAB to my bookworm friends.  It's a great summer read.	1998-04-17

I don't know what exactly it was that disappointed me so about this book.  Perhaps it was its disjointed beginning chapters, or that I felt it never really picked up with any sort of continuous flow.  I never felt like I knew any of the characters well enough to sympathize or relate to them.  There are no scenes or anecdotes that memorably capture the heart, mind or spirit of the reader.  As a follow-up to Angela's Ashes, it was a great disappointment.  That at least had some solid development; this, I feel, does not.  I was less concerned how it ended than I was about actually getting through it, which is a shame.	1998-03-18
