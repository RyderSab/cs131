Verso)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Impressive Debut Novel	Kay Kenyon's debut novel \\"Seeds of Time\\" is an impressive effort.  At 513 pages, it develops a story of epic proportions.  <br /> <br />Seeds of Time is set in a bleak future.  The earth is dying from pollution and an elite corps of time travelers is sent into the past to find plants that can thrive on the poisoned earth.  The near death of the earth has spawned serious illness, eco-terrorism, massive crime and a repressive government. <br /> <br />The story centers around Clio Finn, a dive pilot.  In a world where time travel is used to resolve the difficulty of travel to distant planets (you just 'dive' through time until the rotation of the galaxy places your destination in close proximity) dive pilots are a rare breed -- a small percentage of the population who can stay awake during dive to pilot the ships.  As a dive pilot, Clio's questionable past and current indescretions are overlooked. <br /> <br />All previous missions have failed and the earth is desperate and running out of time.  Very early in \\"The Seeds of Time\\" Clio's team finds a planet covered in lush, hardy vegetation that could be the salvation of Earth or could be its undoing!   <br /> <br />The rest of \\"The Seeds of Time\\" is Clio's adventure as the discovery of this planet plays out.  This plot is full of stunning twists and turns -- most of the completely unexpected and I don't want to give them away.   <br /> <br />The book is full of people and things that are not what they appear to be.  And Kay Kenyon does a great job of exploring both time travel and alternate realities without getting bogged down in the science.  The characters are complex, sometimes sympathetic and always believable. <br /> <br />Kenyon leaves a few loose ends, but that's hardly a major fault for a first novel of this magnitude.  This was the first book I've read in a long time that I didn't want to put down.   <br /> <br />Read it and enjoy!	2004-09-18

Whether you watch Fox News or listen to NPR or Air America, there is a limit to the depth of information you can get from a 30 second to two minute spot.  And, lets face it, most people don't read books or the newspaper. People are voting for our elected officials based on what they hear on TV or the radio.   <br /> <br />Al Franken is funny -- laugh out loud funny.  And even people who don't read, read humor.  And if Al Franken can educate the public, I'm all for it. <br /> <br />I won't argue with those that say that Al Franken has an axe or two to grind.  I'm sure that he does.  He makes it very clear that its personal when it comes to some of his targets.  But, his research, with the assistance of 14 top college students, is impeccable.   <br /> <br />In Lies, Franken lays out much the same case that many more serious books do, that the right uses the right wing media to put knowingly put lies into circulation and to spin those lies until the mainstream media picks up on them.  And, if caught lying, they just lie about what they have said.   <br /> <br />Lies is an interesting combination of clear, direct, fact-based attacks on the right and satire.  Since the facts and satire often co-exist in the same paragraph, I had to stop more than once and figure out if some of the more outrageous events and lies were true or satire.  Often they were true. <br /> <br />Even if you're well informed you'll learn new things about the well documented dirty tricks that the right has been playing and the well documented lies the right has been telling.   <br /> <br />If you're a Democrat, read the book and pass it along to your undecided friends.  If you're a Republican, read this book and do your own homework. Decide for yourself whether Franken's research is any good.  Either way, don't make your decisions based on TV and radio.	2004-09-18

Clearly, most reviewers did not enjoy the series.  But I'm going to disagree.  Unfortunately, to make the point, this review includes some spoilers.  So don't read it if you want to be surprised by hwo the story ends. <br /> <br />The premise of the Wicked Willow trilogy is that Willow went bad at the end of season six, really bad.  But she didn't try to end the world.  She focused her energy on bringing Tara back into the world instead.  The god of death, Osiris, told her that it could not be done, but she wouldn't take no for an answer.  She set off to gather the power to bring Tara back.  And she would let nothing stand in her way. <br /> <br />In the first two books, Willow tries to gather power, something that nearly kills Buffy and Anya.  Then she tries to kill Buffy and the rest of the Scoobies.  Both backfire on her.  She's furious.  And then Giles steals the Ghost of Tara from her.  Once that happens, her anger is off the charts. <br /> <br />Broken Sunrise is all about Wicked Willow and her personal journey.  The fact that the series is called Wicked Willow and not Evil Willow is important.  Willow never becomes truly evil.  She's angry, hurt and misguided.  And in Wicked Willow we get to experience all the angst with her.  This is, as I said in my review of Shattered Twilight, a character study with some action and adventure thrown in, rather than the opposite. <br /> <br />In Broken Sunrise, what is left of Willow's life falls apart.  Her coven still has doubts about her, questions are being asked about the missing members of her coven and her former friends have stolen the ghost of Tara from her.  Willow's anger escalates and she attacks the Scoobies yet again.  Unfortunately this time she succeeds.  And, as three Scoobies lie in the hospital near death, Willow must make a choice.  Does she save her former friends or let them die?   <br /> <br />Throughout this book, Willow wrestles with her pain and anger and, ultimately, her goodness.  And that is really what Wicked Willow is about, that Willow's pain drove her to do some terrible things, but Willow is still Willow and there are limits to the horrors she will commit.  She still has a conscience and a soul. <br /> <br />If you're read any of the other reviews you know that the ending of the book returns the story arc to the Buffyverse.  And, if you're paying attention, you'll also realize that the Gnarls are the same demons who capture Willow upon her return to Sunnydale (when she is invisible to her friends) in Season 7.   <br /> <br />While there may have been more satisfying endings for some readers, I believe that this ending made the point.  Willow could never be truly evil.  That wouldn't just be an alternate story, it would be an alternate reality and no one said this story took place in an alternate reality.  This story is simply a continuation of Willow's time as dark Willow. Willow is still Willow.  Keep that in mind and you may find the story more satisfying.  And, if you truly want an alternate reality, skip this one.	2004-09-18

I think that this was disconcerting for many readers, as they didn't understand the characters, their behaviors and motivations. <br /> <br />As book two, Shattered Twilight, developed, Wicked Willow's universe came into sharper focus.  The feelings and motivations of Willow and the other characters became clearer.  And what became clearest amidst the confusion and turmoil that virtually all the characters were feeling was that the universe wasn't really that different.   <br /> <br />The Wicked Willow trilogy, as the Buffy TV series in general, is very much a character study.  In this trilogy, the action is simply a backdrop for the characters confusion, frustration and pain to play out.  I suspect that this is why some reviewers haven't really enjoyed the books.  But, I've found them engaging and fascinating. <br /> <br />The character in the greatest emotional pain throughout the series is Willow.  In the first book, Willow saved Buffy only because Tara forces her to.  The consequences were high, with the loss of five members of her coven and the trust of those who remain and now she's mad!  As the second book begins, Willow sets about to rebuild her coven to full strength and obtain her revenge against the Scoobies. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Anya is desperately trying to help Giles walk again.  This section of the book provides incredible insights into the experiences of Giles, Buffy, Dawn, Anya and Xander as they wrestle with their various feelings of frustration, anger, loss, gratitude and guilt. <br /> <br />Eventually, the Scoobies turn their attention to stopping Willow.  It is at this point that they realize that they didn't understand Willow's motivations or intentions in gathering power, setting the stage for book three. <br /> <br />Shattered Twilight did drag a bit in the middle, but it picked us steam in the second half and reached full speed by the end.  Shattered Twilight left me waiting to read book three!	2004-09-18

As political opinions and social norms change, some poltical parties gain ground while others lose ground.  The authors decribe why each party has gained or lost over the last 70 years or so, with a focus on more recent elections.  As a bit of a bonus, the authors go into some detail on why the American political system supports only two major parties and the role of third parties in the political process. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most fascinating part of the book is the authors' predictions about how 9/11 would impact the midterm (2002) elections.  They also discuss the idea that the shift to a democratic majority will be delayed only as long as American public remains focused on terrorism AND belives that the Republican party is doing a credible job fighting terrorism.   <br /> <br />While the author's theories remain to be proven or disproven by history, this last theory becomes particularly interesting, given the Bush administration's preoccupation with waging war.  Another reviewer suggested that this book should be required reading by the Bush and Kerry campaigns.  It would appear that the Bush administration did read it. <br /> <br />This book is well researched, with the authors' arguments clearly described and substantiated.  I highly recommend this for anyone interested in taking a longer term view of American politics. <br />	2004-08-16

I picked up Beggar's Ride in a bookstore without noticing that it was book three of a trilogy.  I'm usually a stickler for reading an author's books in the order they were written - even when they're unrelated.  So, reading the third book in a trilogy without reading the first two is a stretch for me, but I did it. And, boy was I disappointed. <br /> <br />In my experience, you don't read later books first because, in an effort to make sure the reader knows what is going on, authors tend to give away important plot information from the first two books.  Not this one!  I managed to get through this book without truly understanding the sleepless, the super sleepless or anything about what motivated them.  I learned nothing about the Change wars.  While I could follow the plot of Beggars Ride reasonably well; without any information about the world it just wasn't very interesting. <br /> <br />The characters in Beggars Ride were, generally, not very interesting.  In many cases, their motivations were incomprensible.  The plot twists (which I won't reveal for those who still want to read this) felt like real cop-outs and the ending seemed more than a little unrealistic. <br /> <br />Since I didn't read the first two books in the trilogy, I'll give Ms. Kress the benefit of the doubt and give her two stars.  But, really, all books should stand on their own.  They should be better when read as a series, but comprehensible independently.  Next time, if Ms. Kress can't be bothered to work the pertinent details into the story, maybe she should consider providing a written version of \\"previously on...\\"	2004-08-16
US	52960050	R3DTC62B03N2T0	055312692X	593368073	The Dancing Dodo	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Ordinary	While I don't believe The Dancing Dodo was 'hopeless' as another reviewer described it, it certainly isn't John Gardner's best effort. <br /> <br />Dancing Dodo is set in the late 70's when many WWII vets were still young enough to be up to no good.  This is a rather typical story of a Nazi plot that went wrong during the war.   <br /> <br />When an American plane is found crashed in a field in England, the Americans and Brits are called in for a joint investigation.  But things start to go wrong, with people getting sick from a mysterious disease and the pricipal investigator being attached by mouldering corpses.   <br /> <br />The novel includes a romantic interlude for the hero and the classic climax at a deserted country manor house.  While the answer isn't entirely obvious halfway through, the book isn't particularly suspenseful or well paced.  <br /> <br />The Dancing Dodo is a fine read, but it just doesn't go anywhere.  You'll probably wish you'd picked up another John Gardner book instead.	2004-08-16

When they plan to meet her friend is gunned down in the middle of a restaurant.  Meanwhile a supernatural entity takes out an entire club full of bad guys.  <br />Angel and Gunn set out for the \\"Nemesis\\" that killed a club full of baddies and end up tangled up with a bunch of sorcers in a  sort of anti-Hogwarts where powerful mages hold each others children hostage.  But, hey, they do educate them in the process.   <br />While Angel and Gunn are trying to find \\"Nemesis\\" Gunn indulges in some very out-of-character complaining about his relationship with Angel and pens a ridiculous comic book parody of Angel. A convenient, if ridiculous, plot device. <br />While Gunn's characterization is completely off the wall, most of the other characters are drawn very accurately, as one would expect from two writers so experienced with Angel and Buffy.<br />Overall, its a solid and engaging book, but the plot was a bit convoluted.  At times I found myself looking back as I tried to figure out if I'd missed something.<br />If you're a fan who wants to read everything or even most things in the Angel cannon, read this book.  You'll still enjoy it.  If you're looking for ONE Angel book to read, pick another one.	2004-07-19

Worse than Watergate has to be the best expose of the Bush Administration that I've read.  And Worse than Watergate is written by an insider in what had previously been the most corrupt administration in this country's history.  Dean was a Republican (although he's given up politics) with no reason to bash Bush.<br />And, to be clear, the purpose of Dean's book is not to bash Bush, but rather to try to warn Bush and the American people what a dangerous road the Bush administration is on.  And by drawing parallels to the Nixon administration, he warns of what is likely to happen if Bush is elected for a second term.<br />In Worse that Watergate, Dean walks us through the secrecy, double dealings and hidden agendas of the Bush Administration.  As I mentioned, he then extrapolates those behaviors into likely scenarios for Bush's second term - if he is elected.  Next, Dean provides a list of eleven scandals likely to emerge from the Bush administration in the coming years.  Finally, Dean disects Bush's argument for going to war in Iraq, listing each lie and exaggeration.<br />This book is meticulously researched, with hundreds of footnotes citing primary sorces.  This is a great resource for anyone who wants to become better educated on the Bush presidency and make an informed choice in November. <br />This book will scare you.  After reading this book I understood that some of my worst fears about the Bush administration were completely true.  ANd that the truth was worse than my fears. <br />Now, if we could only figure out how to get Bush's supporters to read this book and understand the truth!	2004-07-19

Bush, The GOP's CEO	Books	5	16	19	N	N	An exercise in truth-telling	Paul Begala's book, It's STILL the Economy Stupid, is more relevant than ever as we approach the 2004 election.  It is clear from his editorializing that Begala is no fan of George Bush, but that shouldn't stop any thinking person who wants to understand who &quot;the only President we have&quot; is and what he stands for from reading this book - Democrat or Republican.  The book is well written and well documented.  Begala does not make unsupported accusations.  He carefully lays out the evidence that makes his case.<br />In this book, Begala goes through Bush's speeches and his record and uncovers a number of disturbing patterns, including George's habit of making promises and then disregarding then days or weeks later and his systematic efforts to cut taxes for ONLY the rich, with the super-rich receiving the vast majority of the benefits.<br />Begala also carefully explains how the Republicans in Congress blocked Clinton's efforts to put reforms in place that would have curbed big business and avoided both the Enron and accounting scandals among others.  This was especially interesting to me, as the Republicans have laid the blame for these things at Clinton's feet. <br />Don't take my word for what Begala says.  If you want to make an educated choice between Bush and Kerry in November; if you want to understand who you're voting for; if you want to understand the record of the incumbent President, read this book.	2004-07-19

And I loved almost every bit of it.  If this is representive of Matt Ruff's work, he's a brilliant writer. <br />The only reason that I didn't give the book five stars is that the ending is a bit weak compared to the rest of the book.  But, regardless of the ending, the ride was worth it.<br />The cast of Sewer, Gas and Electric includes a Multi-Billionare businessman, Harry Gant.  Harry wants to do the right thing, but doing the right thing is boring -- it just doesn't hold his attention.  So, he hired an environmentalist that he'd dated in college, Joan, as an executive in his company to keep him honest.  They battle over company decisions and eventually marry and then divorce, all the time where the story occurs.<br />Other characters include a non-violent eco-terrorist with a submarine decorated with pink polka dots that he docks under the statue of liberty, the crew of the submarine, including a mixed Israeli/Palestinian family, and a few war veterns suffering from serious PTSD.  Oh, and we can't forget the VERY evolved, very dangerous shark that has escaped from the NY City sewers.  And the Queen of England...<br />Early on in the book, it isn't clear whether the plot revolves around Gant's quest to build a mile-high tower or the eco-terrorists efforts to stop Gant industries from drilling for oil in the Antarctica.  It turns out that its neither.<br />I really don't want to give anything away.  If you like science fiction and you enjoy off the wall plots and don't mind a bit of politically incorrect humor, you'll LOVE this book.	2004-07-19

These traits, in moderation, can help managers be successful.  But, taken to an extreme, can destroy a career. <br />The authors provide examples of people suffering from each derailer and then provide diagnostic tools to help you identify whether you suffer from the derailer and advice to help you manage the derailers that you do have.  <br />The descriptions and the advice are excellent, but the treatment is a little shallow.  So, if your derailer manifests itself in some way other than the 'classic' pattern you may not recognize it from the information in the text.  And, if you decide you have a derailer, you may need to look elsewhere for more detailed advice about how to work through it.  <br />Overall though, the book was a fun, thought-provoking read.

Set in the fourth season of Angel, relationships are falling apart all around -- Fred and Gunn are pretending they don't have a problem, Angel is pretending that he isn't in love with Cordelia and that he isn't upset that Connor has moved out and Wes is pretending that he isn't involved with Lilah.  <br />Jeff Mariotte, an experienced Buffy/Angel writer portrays all the drama and angst realistically.  The characters and their interactions with each other ring true, providing the perfect backdrop for any story.<br />And the story is a unique one.  Imagine a seventy-something widow, Mildred Finster, who decides that she wants to be a private investigator and that she wants to work for Angel investigations.  When Angel and company decline her services, she sets out to prove that she can do the job.  After getting results where Angel can't a couple times, Mildred gets herself into more trouble than she bargains for and everyone comes together to save the day.<br />This book was totally unexpected.

While I didn't enjoy this story immmensely, it was extremely well executed.  Its the story of a slayer who was trained without understanding her calling.  When she was called she still didn't understand the rules of the game.  The story follows her frustration and angst and she realizes that she has failed to fulfill her duty because she doesn't understand her duty.  <br />The second story is set in China in 1856 and revolves around yet another Slayer who doesn't really understand her calling. She has been trained.  But when her Watcher died she ran away from the monastery where he trained her and posed as a man to survive on her on in the city.  Her new Watcher finds her and they (reluctantly) set out to destroy an extremely powerful vampire.  Another excellently executed story.<br />The third novella is set in Hollywood in the 1940s.  The then current slayer and her Watcher set out to find a Watcher that has gone AWOL from the council.  In the process they encounter a bar full of demons and stars, someone who is killing demons - both dangerous and peaceful - indiscriminately, and vigilante demons who want to find and punish the demon killer.  This story is particularly captivating for the amount of gray in it.  In this story, the slayer spends a lot of time tredding in the space between black and white, between good and evil.<br />The final novella is set in Tokyo in 1993 and involves Buffy's predecessor, India.  India is able to move freely around Tokyo with her Watcher because her parents don't have the time to pay much attention to her.  She has a bit of a crush on her handsome young watcher, Kit, only adding to the dramatic tension of the story.  India and Kit have been called to help a clan destroy their ancestor who was turned into a vampire, along withover 50 of his fellow warriors.  Another ancestor vowed that no one in the family would rest until the vampire samauri was destroyed.  But, they're running out of descendents and time.  So, India is called in as reinforcements.<br />As with any short story (or novella) collection, the topics and writing are varied.  So, one story may not appeal to you simply because you're not interested in China in the 1800s or in Samauri stories.  But all the stories are well written, with the well developed characters allowed by this longer form.  If you're interested in exploring the history of the slayers, this collection is for you.	2004-07-19

Where the good and evil are judged.  That one.  The BIG one.<br />Unlike many of the Buffy books where it is fairly obvious how Buffy will save the day, Apocalypse memories kept me wondering until the end just how Buffy was going to get out of this mess. <br />And, there are some excellent plot devices, such as the literal interpretation of the wolf-in-sheep's clothing and the unfightable bad guy.<br />The major subplot of this book, set early in Season Seven, is Willow's struggle with her magic and her fear that she'll return to the dark side if she starts using magic again.  Willow's struggle with magic is realistically drawn as are most of the major characters.<br />My major complaint with this book is that it was too short for the ground it tried to cover.  Under those circumstances, there really wasn't the depth of plot development that I would have liked.  In addition, there were a couple places where seemingly important details were never tied back into the story.<br />All in all, a good, short read and faithful to the Buffy-verse.	2004-07-19

I'm big fan of the show and got hooked on the books early on.  I have to say that this is one of the best of series.<br />Imagine if Giles, Xander and the gang hadn't been able to turn Willow back to good.  Imagine a world where Willow is the new 'big bad' in Sunnydale.  Imagine that Buffy's next mission is to stop her best friend.  Having seen Willow go so far down the evil road during the season six finale, its not hard to imagine.  And, Yvonne Navarro does a brilliant job of bringing that possible world to life.<br />The Darkening tells the story of Willow's grief.  She turns her back on her friends and desperately tries to both make those responsible (in her mind) pay for her loss of Tara and to bring Tara back.<br />The Darkening captures the motivations and behaviours of the characters perfectly -- from Willow's grief and angst over her loss of Tara to Anya's pointed truth-telling.  We get an incredible look into the world that might have been.  <br />The Darkening is a 'must read' for any Buffy fan.	2004-05-30

The duplicates just happen to reflect their darker, angrier selves.  And their duplicates are out to destroy them.<br />The book is well written and fast paced.  The character portrayals are strong and the interrelationships are accurate for the timing of the book (clearly early in season 4).  <br />Gardner does a good job of capturing the strained relationship between Wesley and Angel Investigations, the complex relationship between Wesley and Lilah and Conner's confusion about who he is and what (and who) he should believe.  <br />The ending seems to wrap up quickly (...).  But, really, that mirrors the format of a one hour television series, where all is neatly wrapped up in the last 10 minutes.  It is, in essence, exactly what we expect and saying that gives away nothing of the plot! <br />I was a little unclear about how the characters knew how to put a final end to their duplicates (and  I won't go into that as it does give something away).  I'll just say that I didn't see that part explained -- it may have been edited out or I may just have missed it, as I did read the book in a hospital waiting room.<br />If you like Angel or Angel books, I'd recommend this book.  Its exactly what it should be; a fast paced adventure, true to the characters and the story.  Its sure to make for an enjoyable afternoon of reading.	2004-05-16

At 204 pages (with large print) its a quick read.  It was a fun book, although I didn't really find it as laugh-out-loud funny as some of the other reviewers seemed to.  And, I actually expected something better.  I didn't close the book thinking it was one of the best books I'd ever read.  But I did think it was one of the more thought provoking books I'd read in a while.<br />Fir all that, Down and Out is a good bit of sci-fi.  It brings up some interesting ideas as all good sci-fi should!<br />The premise of the book is that scarcity and death have both ended.  The big concerns of the future are overcrowding and bordem.  Under these circumstances where courtesy and interesting ideas would become of paramount importance, the world (or most of it) has transformed into a reputation economy.<br />The idea of a reputation economy, which we argueably have to some extent today (think credit ratings, time served in jail, where you went to school) is taken to the extreme.  You purchase goods, services and experiences not based on how much money you earn but how much Whuffie you have.  And you gain Whuffie by being a decent person and by doing cool things that others like.  The more Whuffie, the better your life is -- the best restaurants, places to stay, cars, etc.  That premise by itself made the book interesting.  Imagine living in a world where your behavior is mediated by what people think of it.  You can't get rich by swindling others.  You have to do it by doing things that people like -- the more people the better.<br />The other fascinating premised of the book, and certainly one that isn't new, is that no one dies.  People backup up their brains regularly and if their bodies dies, they're just restored from backup.  I found myself thinking about the ultimate question here.  If you're restored from backup are you the same person?  Certainly, you think you are.  But, is it the same consciousness or did one persondie and another one get created?<br />As I said -- its a fun read and deeper than it looks.  Cory Doctrow will have you thinking about the meaning of life and of your life if you let him.	2004-05-16
US	52960050	R65XEOGUZILRE	0446606081	198340912	The Ax	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Brilliant, bizarre and disturbing	I'm a big fan of Donald Westlake.  I love his comic crime novels where I find myself rooting for the slightly inept bad guys to get away with their crimes.  When I decided to read The Ax, it never ocurred to me that I'd end up rooting for Burke Devore to get away with multiple murders.<br />This is a book about one man, written entirely in the first person.  A man who believes he can rely on no one but himself.  In that vein all the other characers are merely shadows, or stick figures.  They exist only through Burke's eyes.  He IS the book.<br />Burke is a former production line manager in a paper mill who was laid off in the mid-nineties and has been unemployed for two years at the time of the novel (1997).  He is at end of his rope -- his unemployment has run out and so, it seems, have his job prospects.  <br />Burke decides to take matters into his own hands.  He places an ad in a trade journal to evaluate the competition.  Then, he decides to just get rid of them.  He selects the job that he wants and then he kills off the competition AND the incumbent. <br />Burke goes on a killing spree through New York, Conn., and Mass.  He kills the competition in broad daylight by the side of the road and in a crowded parking lot.  He kills in a deserted mall parking lot and he even blows up a house.  <br />The fact that Burke gets away with all these murders is completely implausable.  The fact that the cops don't catch him and that he even manages to get rid of the evidence of his son's (unrelated) breaking and entering is unlikely.  The fact that the search of the house that follows his son's crime raises no questions in the minds of the police is ridiculous.  But it doesn't really matter. The fact that it is so unlikely that he'll get away with it all makes us identify with Burke all the more.<br />As the book progressed, I found myself disturbed by how much I could identify with Burke.  I've never been laid off -- I work for one of those places that used to provide 'lifetime employment.'  Not anymore.  I can imagine myself laid off, desperate, looking for a job, as my family loses more and more opportunity and my retirement plans slip away.  Can't most all of us?  <br />Most of us can't imagine taking Burke's reasoning to the final end -- that the end of providing for his family (at one point in the book, Burke bristles when the judge says that Burke's son &quot;comes from poverty.&quot;) justifies any means, even murder.  But, many of us can identify with his desperation.<br />This is satire at its finest -- dark, disturbing and with an edge of truth.  This book could certainly be read simply as a book about a serial killer, but it is truly much more than that.  It is a book about Every Man for the age of downsizing, much as Death of a Salesman was about the Every Man of its time.<br />You might find it disturbing, but do read this book.  Donald Westlake has outdone himself this time.	2004-05-16

I enjoyed it far more that Snow Crash. While Snow Crash got off to a great start, I didn't enjoy the second half at all.  I found myself reading it because it was a groundbreaking book, not because I enjoyed it.  I read The Diamond Age because it was a fast-paced enjoyable read AND because it was unique and thought-provoking.<br />The Diamond Age is set is a very plausable near future where nanotech has eliminated basic problems, such as starvation, but its created its share of problems as well.  Nasty nanotech devices that can track or kill people require sophisticated nanotech defenses.  <br />Meanwhile, all nanotech products are provided be a central feed that both controls what can be delivered, what is free and what costs money, and frees peasents from substistence farming and the poor from working to survive.  While this world is harldy a utopia -- as there are still massive economic disparities between the rich and poor and a tremendous amount of crime and pollution -- Westerners on the whole seem happy with this arangement.  <br />But there are more than a few who are unhappy or restless.  The Diamond Age is the story of what happens when a father who wants a better life for his daughter collides with an entire culture that wants change.  Throw in an enormous computer made of human bodies, an interactive storybook that tells a story that takes over a decade to read, an army of teenage girls and a few other interesting characters and you have a compelling and fascinating view of the future.<br />When I first finished the book, I thought the ending was abrupt and disappointing.  But, as I started to think about the end, I could see everything falling into place.<br />This is the best book I've read in a while and I highly recommend it.	2004-05-09

Well over half the book is set in ancient Egypt.  This portion of the book is exciting and unpredictable. It tells the tale of three young magicians and what happens when they combine their powers. There were several times when the twists and turns in the plot took me by complete surprize.<br />The second half sees the three separateds into various combinations of two and one.  This part of the book is much less imaginative.  I found some of things to be a bit predicatable, while in other places I just found the outcome slightly disappointing.<br />This is a good book, but the second half didn't live up to the promise of the first half.	2004-05-03

George Baxt delivers a brilliant Pharoah Love mystery with A Queer Kind of Love.  <br />Pharoah is a black, gay NYPD detective.  He's also one of the top detectives on the force and completely out, irreverent and flamboyant.  <br />This latest mystery is a bit darker than most of George Baxt's writing, as Pharoah confronts tough choices presented by some of his oldest friends and betrayal by others close to him.  But Pharoah deals with the conflicts and confrontations with his usual wit and style regardless of the turmoil inside him.<br />While parts of the ending could be predicted by the sharp observer, the book was not predictable.  And the final twist of the book is definitely one of the 'laugh out loud' moments.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It was a real treat.	2004-04-18

This is the fourth such experience for the British lesbian and former journalist who has been transplanted to the US where she now teaches Journalism.  <br />When Lindsey returns to the UK to complete research for her dissertation, she finds herself not only involved in UK trade union politics, but also a murder suspect.  Intent on clearing her name and ensuring that she can return to the States, Lindsey and her girlfriend dive head first into solving one, or maybe two, murders.<br />This is a great whodunnit with well developed and likeable characters and a plot that keeps you guessing right up until the very end.  <br />A final comment I'll add is that while the book is about trade unions, there was remarkably little politics and what was included actually served the story -- unlike some novels that seem to be more politics than plot.  <br />If you've ever enjoyed any lesbian mystery novel in the past, you're likely to enjoy this one.	2004-04-18

I was pleased to find that this was a collection of strong, imaginative stories.  A few of the stories weren't really my taste, but they were all well written.  <br />I do have to say that while the stories were almost always about sex in one way or another, I only found a couple slightly erotic.  In fact several of the stories are not suited for the squemish -- or the less open-minded.<br />Ignoring the lack of erotica, the collection was quite strong.  The opening story, in particular, was brilliant.  I won't give the plot away, but it was a clever re-telling of a classic story.<br />If you like vampire stories and you are willing to stretch your definition of 'vampire' you'll probably enjoy these short stories, but don't expect a 'can't put it down' read.	2004-04-18

It is well written and grabs you from the very first page.  And, while they say every story has been told, this one managed to put some unique twists on the &quot;what if science could allow is to live again&quot; story.  <br />WARNING: This paragraphy gives clues about the ending!  The ending was a bit too tidy.  Alec's world had been getting worse and worse and then, in one fell swoop, he entire life comes together (anyone have a magic wand?).  But, that didn't really bother me.  The reality is that by that point in the book, I wanted things to go right for Alec.  I liked Alec and I wanted things to work out for him.  And, really, so what if the ending is a little forced.  I read this book for fun and it was fun.  I have no problem at all with everyone living happily ever after in a light scifi novel!<br />This book was a fun story that I enjoyed immensely.  As long as you don't read this book looking for something deeply intellectual (and you enjoy science fiction) you'll enjoy it too.	2004-04-18
US	52960050	R28KIOIV1L9LIM	0553575481	227588802	Contraband	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Ultimately Disappointing	Contraband is set in the distopian near future, where the world is run by an increasingly repressive government that monitors all of its citizens activities and movements.  The main charater is a smuggler living outside the law.  <br />When the government creates a new system  for catching smugglers, based on intercepted communications traffic and predictive modeling, the Pilot's world falls apart.  He is shot down and nearly killed.  His former girlfriend ends up in Bellevue when her brother, also a smuggler is presumed killed.  The smuggler then goes off with a rag tag band the search for the creater of the smuggler's bible.  <br />The book started off as a bit of a slog.  At this point about two hundred pages in, the book started to pick up.  Unfortunately, it didn't really last.  <br />From here on the plot became progressively stranger and began to have some rather gaping holes.  When told to go east, the pilot heads directly to a god forsaken spot in Asia with access soon to be cut off by the winter snows.  We never find out why he went to this particular place. <br />The characters have a series of increasingly strange adventures, culminating their return to NY no closer to their objective of shutting down the government's new system.  The characters clear up their personal growth issues and the book just ends with  them deciding to go their separate ways.  The story is never actually resolved, leaving me disappointed.<br />While the quality of the writing is excellent and the characters are well developed, if a bit odd, the plot is full of holes you could drive a semi through.  And, the book was difficult reading.  It only grabbed me briefly.  Most of the time, I was just reading it because of my compulsion to finish the books I start and my hope that it would improve.<br />If science fiction set in the dismal future is your thing, you may enjoy this more than I did.  I mostly found it depressing and not very interesting.	2004-03-28
US	52960050	R1DSDSCPW2HN2C	0805425004	532469790	The Darwin Conspiracy: The Confessions of Sir Max Busby	Books	1	17	37	N	N	Utter Garbage	I'd give this book zero stars if I could.  <br />Whether you believe in evolution, creationism or one of the other middle of the road theories, if you exercise critical thinking skills, you'll be offended by this book.<br />The author, a fundamentalist Christian, uses this book, which purports to be fiction, to imply that all believers in evolution are athiests and that all athiests are evil.  <br />The author also claims that athiests have no morals or ethics and, therefore will do whatever they please, committing all sorts of crimes because God is not going to punish them.  And, lest you think the law will punish those evil dooers, the author contends that those darn evolutionists are busily subverting the law to ensure that there will be no punishment in this life either.  At this point the author goes on a small tirade about the dangers of allowing the law to evolve with the times and be interpreted by judges.  He feels that we should all be governed by the law as it was revealed by God.  <br />The author goes on to suggest that Darwinism is responsible for racism and antisemitism.  This is supported by the rationale that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; justifies racism, antisemitism, slavery, and the inequitable distribution of wealth.  These are, of course, traditionally NOT the positions held by the same liberals and athiests who believe in evolution. But, never mind that detail! <br />The author also takes the opportunity to villify the pro-choice movement, the ACLU and separation of church and state.  Oh, and lest I forget, he doesn't like the idea of state run child welfare services because the state might remove your children if you punish them in the way proscribed by the bible.  Pesky government, not letting you beat your children.<br />The author also takes a thinly-vieled pot shot at Ted Turner, putting him in the center of the modern day conspiracy to keep the &quot;truth&quot; about Darwinism quiet.  <br />I picked this book up at a local mystery bookstore, expecting an interesting and thought provoking novel.  Instead I got a poorly written manifesto from a the Four Square Church.<br />The only redeeming quality of the book was that it was short - so I didn't waste much time reading this rubbish.   I did want to get to the end though, so I could provide a thorough assessment of the book and, hopefully, save others from wasting a Saturday afternoon.<br />If you want to read about the continuing (and fascinating) debate between evolution and creation, you're better off with many other books that don't claim to be fiction.  <br />If you want to be indoctrinated into the Four Square church, you can read this propaganda, but you'd be better off going directly to the church for honest information about their beliefs.<br />Either way, save your money.  I wish that I had.  I certainly wish that Mr. Bell hadn't gotten any of my money!	2004-03-07

So, I was thrilled to discover Aileen Schumacher's mystery series a few years ago.  <br />I've read them all, always eagerly awaiting the next novel.  The characters are well developed and the plots are well designed -- allowing you to sometimes figure out what will happen and other times be utterly surprised.  <br />Seeing the characters develop in this second novel and the relationship between Tory and David grow has been a real treat.<br />My disclaimer is that I'm an engineer, so I may enjoy the subject matter of the series more than most, but it should be a good read for all mystery readers.	2004-03-07

It is horrible.  The book reads like Sterling and Gibson came up with a concept, divided up the chapters and never checked in again.  The early characters disappear and sort of reappear at the end. I kept reading, hoping that it would all come together at the end, but it didn't.  In fact, the last section left me completely mystified.<br />I took this with me on a business trip to the middle east and read it on my return flight.  I was hoping for an engrossing read that would make the remaining trip enjoyable.  Instead, I experienced the longest flight of my life as I slogged through this mess.	2002-08-20

I took it on a trip last week, expecting a great read -- like the Poppy Z Brite books I've read.  I was completely disappointed. I've liked virtually every vampire book I've read - until this one.  I kept reading one story after another, hoping they'd get better.  But, I got to the end of the book and they hadn't! <br />The stories were strange variations of the vampire theme.  I'm all for variations on a theme, but not as an excuse for poor writing.  Most seemed to be written for their shock value rather than with the intent of composing a strong story.  <br />I found only a couple stories even vaguely erotic.  Most were more disguisting that erotic.  I found Nancy Holder's story to be quite strong - but not as good as her other writing.  That along with the The S&amp;M themed story were the most erotic of the bunch!  <br />The quality of the writing was disappointing.  In many cases the stories were quite disjointed and where there were multiple threads, they were often not pulled together at the end of the story.  On one occasion, I literally found myself wondering whether they had failed to print the end of the story, as at just ended for no apparent reason.<br />I don't read lots of short stories, but I don't believe that I was disappointed in these just because they were short stories.  I believe that this collection is fatally flawed. <br />Save your money.  I've got Love in Vein II on my shelf waiting to be read.  I sure hope it is better!	2001-06-26
