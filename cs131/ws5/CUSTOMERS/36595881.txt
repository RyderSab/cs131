Its contents are rich; and are organized in a way many standard microbiology texts are not. Both established and opportunistic pathogens were grouped together, not by taxonomical relationships, but by their predilection to cause disease in a particular area of the body. Thus, while reading this book, bear in mind that its author grouped organisms that cause skin diseases together: regardless of whether they are bacteria, viruses, or fungi.<BR>\\"Microbiology in Clinical Practice\\" did ramify areas of diagnostic analysis, chemotherapy, epidemiology, zoonoses, nosocomial infections, as well as methods of disinfection and sterilization.<BR>The book spared no effort in explaining various terms and concepts. And, I believe that fledging doctors, nurses, and lab scientists would find it helpful.	2003-05-11

Of particular interest in this regard are the areas that dealt with collective output, professional ethics, prioritizing aims, and meeting objectives and responsibilities.<BR>Designed to save time without running short of vital information, the 250 pages of this book constitute a handy reference, which busy people should appreciate.

It explained Italy: one bit at a time. But, for a traveller who is more interested in hopping around than in devouring endless pages, this book may become a burden. I would suggest that intending travellers (and holiday-makers) should regard it as a home reference, while embarking on their trip with a lighter text.<BR>This book is generous with all that concerned Italy: from the ancient Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and down to twentieth century secular state.

The theme of this book is efficiency. It is versatile, and bore expressive evidence of refined methodologies. Those involved in organizational management would value its aiding range. Of interest to the double-minded is how the first part of this book, (that is, chapters one to eight), used practical examples to encourage change.<BR>And, as corporate norms continue to evolve rapidly, &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; welcomed all, but is bold enough to warn that 'all that glitters may not be gold'. One thing I like about this book is that it did not stop at enumerating the reasons for discouraging a given practice, but provided logical alternative in each case.<BR>In a nutshell, &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; is a book whose chapters are dedicated to improving corporate efficiency. It is easy to comprehend; and helps its reader to assess and opt for ideas based on their profitability worths, as opposed to their mere popularities.	2003-05-11

I also appreciated its details on several tourists' trails, accomodations, means of transportation, and so on. However, I was very disappointed to note that (just like the &quot;Lonely Planet Africa on a Shoestring&quot;) this book is full of discouraging comments. Some of the phrases Lonely Planet used in this book are quite offensive.<BR>For sure, most foreigners who travel to (West) African countries are not expecting to see a paradise, but that does not mean that there is no better way of presenting real and imaginary negative thoughts. This book is smeared by terms and phrases, which I consider derogatory to both (West) Africa and (West) Africans.

It clearly outlined and defined the basic principles of enzymology: focussing on both their nature and their clinical applications. Without delving into the complex kinetics aasociated with catalytic reactions, \\"Enzymes: The Key to Health\\" did shed light on the biochemical and physiological pathways connected with each enzyme it discussed.<br />It also did a good job in describing the multicomponent forms of these globular proteins. The same could be said concerning the way it classified each enzyme group.<br />This is an interesting book to read, if you want to get a good understanding of enzymology with little or no biochemistry hassles.

It also gave useful suggestions on how LDAP learners could comb through data when surmising or searching for a particular piece of information, (e.g. a security certificate, an e-mail address, or similar information).<BR>In conclusion, this is an essential guide, which should provide any LDAP beginner (or enthusiast) with all the information he (or she) may need concerning this network protocol.

Unless you are a complete UNIX dummy, there is not much to expect (or benefit) from this book. Its meager 158 pages only succeeded in brushing around the very basics (and simple commands). Apart from its cogent narrations on how best a novice could explore UNIX applications and use command interface, there is little that shine in this book.<BR>Anyone who knows one or two things about UNIX is likely to be disappointed by its inept coverage. Hence, I would advise such person to opt for &quot;Mac OS X for Unix Geeks&quot;, which provided a more palatable gist in a chronological order. Versatile enthusiasts, who are interested in advanced explorations, should consider &quot;Mac OS X Unleashed&quot;.

It was first published as 'My Bondage and My Freedom' in 1855. Again in 1881, it appeared as 'Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'.<br />Lively and sympathetically refreshing, this book gave a comprehensive narration regarding Frederick Douglass' life as a slave, and then, as a free abolitionist (and civil rights leader).<br />Born as Augustus Frederick Washington Bailey in Talbot county, Maryland, in 1817, young Frederick was a slave right from his mother's womb. However, a successful escape in 1838 changed his life (as well as his name). Known simply as Frederick Douglass, he migrated to New York; and finally settled at Bedford, Massachusetts: where he mastered the art of abolitionism.<br />The young man's writings and eloquent speeches reminded Americans of the evils of slavery. Not even resentments and pro-slavery racist attacks could deter him.<br />Soon after publishing his revealing autobiography in 1845, he fled to England in order to escape deportation and re-enslavement (in the South). Fortunately in 1847, some English Quakers purchased his freedom, and he returned (legally free) to the U.S.<br />This book gave a good account of how Mr Douglass directed &quot;underground railroad&quot;, which took fugitive slaves to their freedom in Canada. It also narrated how he founded his abolitionist newspaper: 'The North Star'.<br />However in 1859, Frederick fled to England once more, having been accused of helping John Brown in the designing stage of his slave revolt plot. He did return to U.S. in 1860, and publicly supported Abraham Lincoln's presidential bid. He held respectable official posts in various capacities: among which was the United States' Minister to Haiti. He wrote several books and newspaper articles, and was finally laid to rest in 1895.<br />This book, (&quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;), is a classical masterpiece.

It is a quality lexicon which Oxford University Press crafted with both care and patience.<BR>A true descendant of the unabridged version, this healthy scion boasts of more than 170,000 headwords and phrases. Each entry was defined using contemporary translation. Whether you are an English speaker who is learning Spanish or vice-versa, this is a dependable tool to keep at hand. It counts: whether head or tail! And, it used the simplest illustrations to explain the meanings of its headwords.<BR>Almost everything about this lexicon is positive. Given its reasonable price-tag, I did not find any serious offence to accuse it of. I will recommend it for both teachers and students. Professional translators and advanced-level teachers should go for the more versatile unabridged version.	2003-03-05

Every detail was bared!<BR>In all the aliphatic and alicyclic compounds they dealt with, the authors of this book gave comprehensive insight into the behaviour of each Homologous Series: with thorough analysis of the unique characteristics of respective Funtional Groups.<BR>The simplistic method with which it described Molecular Orbital and Orbital Symmetry is commendable. Readers would as well, value its style of explaining the fundamental mechnisms of Polymerization, in addition to other synthetic pathways through which several important compounds like the Amines, the Esters, and the Carboxylic Acids are obtained.<BR>This is a wonderful book, which touched every section of Organic Chemistry. Apart from insinuating that comparable texts sell for cheaper rates, the only significant complaint anyone could table against this book is that it provided too much details in its analyses. But, is that really a fault?	2003-03-02

Its information are concise; yet, detailed enough. There are both tutorials and worked examples in every chapter: hence, making it a fine revision tool.<BR>However, bear in mind that the contents of this book are more or less obsolete.

Anybody who is familiar with Windows XP system, (Home or Professional), would be amazed at how this book tendered revamped information on the usefulness of the Operating System's Backup and Recovery Tools. The same applies to the utilities of its Device Driver Rollback.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Windows XP in a Nutshell&quot; is a quality textbook, which would serve the needs of its readers.

However, it is worthwhile noting that all that glitters is not gold.<BR>Although aware that this 20-volume set is cumbersome for the average day-to-day use, its publishers, (the Oxford University Press), instilled extreme restrictive flexibility on the only easy way out: the use of its CD-ROM version. This fact made the choice of \\"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\\" seem more attractive.<BR>Unlike the bulky twenty-volume 'real thing', this 'Shorter' alternative is a relatively portable two-volume set, which impressively contains 33% of what its 'big-brother' boasts of. Also, its listed price is a meagre 5% of what the 'real thing' costs: thus making it a wiser choice (and a greater value for money).<BR>In conclusion, I acknowledge the fact that the versatility of \\"Oxford English Dictionary (20-volume set)\\" is superlative. But unless you need the most extensive dictionary money can buy, and be prepared to peruse twenty texts when in need of definitions, I would suggest that you act wisely and invest on its 'Shorter' cousin. The size of the \\"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\\" is a portable one-tenth that of this 20-volume set.

It also exposed all the factors, which are likely to escalate Berkeley Internet Name Domain problems, before providing their remedies in a clear sequential order.<BR>Net Administrators (as well as voracious users of any of the major Operating Systems) would appreciate the inclusion of an easy-to-digest chapter on Internet Protocol version 6, (IPv6). This book clearly made the mark!<BR>Apart from the rather summarized information, which I noticed on two of its chapters, (i.e.: 'Create Zone Files For Your Domains' and 'Use Increment Transfer'), there is nothing that I will hold against this book. Cricket Liu did a very good job in writing it.	2003-02-09

Its analyses are thorough, and quite understandable. I cherished its authority.<BR>It explained all those hormonal, physical, and emotional changes, which build-up shortly after conception. There are also, chapters that dealt with many problems, which are associated with delicate and multiple pregnancies(i.e: twins, etc.). Labour; complications of labour, as well as various delivery choices and methods were emphasized.<BR>This book exhibits all those experiences, which has made Dr Sears such a reliable adviser.

It is extremely illustrative. Offering advice on both birth-plans and how to tackle any unexpected contingency, one of its strongest point is that it instills confidence, (which any inexperienced mother-to-be would appreciate). Even the last-minute exercise and relaxation options were browsed. And, everything one needed to know about labour and caeserean section were included.<br />There is hardly any pregnant woman who would not value the generous information that this book provides.	2003-02-07

Its coverage of Botany and Zoology: including all those morphological and anatomical details, is overwhelming. The same applies to its accompanying CD-ROM, which bears several test-questions that students should exercise with.<br />Another endearing feature of this book is the way it simplified all the complex biochemical pathways that it presented.<br />It is a very impressive text; (only that non-American users may complain that it did not stick to the S.I. units).	2003-02-05

It did a good job in integrating and correlating all the physiological processes, which sustain life.<BR>The book was designed for students who are taking biology as an ancillary to first degrees. Hence, it compels its users to understand the importance of careful drawing (and/or painting). Though this may seem irritating in the beginning, it yields dividends in the end.<BR>Students are likely to appreciate its fundamental links to both anatomy and physiology. All the important life processes were discussed. But, the fact that this first edition has not been revised since (its first appearance in) 1986 makes the book a bit obsolete.	2003-02-05

But contrary to its name, there is not even a single chapter which discussed how to fix an ailing PC.<BR>Also, the user-level of this book compares to what &quot;For Dummies&quot; series offer. Thus, if you are not a real beginner, there is little to gain by acquiring it. However, if you are indeed a beginner, I must do about-turn, and say that it is worth spending on.

Post-graduate students, as well as practising professionals will find it useful. Its specialized chapters did their best in ramifying every aspect of marketing. Information is everywhere; although that its versatility led to the boring repetition of strategies.<BR>This book is simple and well-written.

Most of its 450 pages were dedicated to a sensible problem-solution-discussion pattern, (which readers should appreciate).<BR>Apart from analyzing how to manipulate XML documents with Stylesheets, elaborate methods of using SVG and XSLT to plot graphs and charts were stressed. The otherwise tricky art of creating SOAP documentations from WSDL (using XSLT) was reduced to nursery rhymes.<BR>I am satisfied by this author's method of tackling XSLT problems. Still, when the next edition of this book appears, I would expect to see a better job done: as regards all those precursors, which facilitate the processing of Visio documents in XSLT.<BR>In conclusion, I would say that this is one of the few eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations books, which did not discriminate between beginners and advanced learners. All are welcomed! A great value indeed!	2003-02-02

But, it is good to note that any student whose foundations in Geometry and Algebra are wanting, may not cope very well.<BR>Most of the chapters which make-up the Mechanics section have solid back-bone. I am particularly impressed by the way it handled Rotational Dynamics, Gravitation, and Simple Harmonic Motion. Its Electricity and Magnetism sections are equally grounded. However, the same cannot be said about Optics, Heat, as well as some of the chapters that belonged to Sound. Also, this is not among the texts that I regard as beginner-friendly; but if your background in Mathematics is above average, there is very little to worry about.<BR>Overall, this is a nice Physics text, although that its authors need to improve on the sections describing Heat and Optics.	2003-02-02

It is full of grounded information, which would ensure that programmers execute their tasks with unflinching confidence.<BR>This book has a result-oriented outlook. Its authoritative analyses of cross-platform programming issues are flawless. All the important classes, (DataSets, DataAdapters, e.t.c.), which constitute ADO.NET received generous attention. However, all these expanded ADO.NET tutorials came at the expense of VB.NET, whose underlying parameters received little attention. Still, this is a valuable book to have.	2003-01-26

These include: HTML 4.01, CSS2, JavaScript 1.5 and DOM Level 2.<BR>Also, there are comprehensive coverage on both Internet Explorer 6 and Netscape Navigator 6. The chapters of this versatile text are excitingly dynamic. All those editorial errors which featured in the previous edition have been rectified. This book is an impressive reference source. It is one of the most precious volumes that web authors and developers should keep at hand.<BR>Each of the entries it illustrates has a sample example, which helps the reader to assimilate the gist.

The book presented detailed information on how to manipulate such Java technologies like Servlets and ServerPages. There are also grounded tutorials on how to create multi-purpose Web applications.<BR>However, instead of making the sample codes available in the textbook, the publisher decided otherwise: opting to make it a downloadable option on her website.

Windows systems users need a lot of prayers, for events to shape-up as they would like.<BR>Conversely, for non-Windows users, there is a lot to celebrate. This updated edition covered (the latest) Apache 2.0 without compromising on the older 1.3 version. Also, there are new sections on Cocoon, Tomcat, mod_perl, PHP, and several others.<BR>Overall, this is a good book; but would have been impeccable, if all the claims its publisher advertised have real life applications.	2003-01-26

In the same vein, experienced users will appreciate its in-depth analysis of every aspect of the software, including the occassional highlights it made concerning its limitations. The outlook of this book is refined, and authoritative. Its versatility is superb. It has every important information that users of 'Dreamweaver MX' would need.<BR>Indeed, it is a shame that profit-minded software manufacturers have consistently refused to include any sort of comprehensive users' manual in their packages. But, don't let this opportunity elude you, if you own (or use) 'Dreamweaver MX'. It is worth the asking price!	2003-01-23

Most adults are likely to enjoy it, despite its juvenile outlook.<BR>However, adult readers would notice that the story was overtly abridged.

It provides its reader with an evocative insight into the capabilities of the Applications suite. Its outlook is that of a narrative summary: saving readers the time that would have been otherwise spent on unnecessary details. The book's information on 'Dreamweaver' tools are complete, but, one may be disappointed by the scanty coverage it gave Codings.<BR>Also, those who are interested in ASP, XHTML, and JavaScripts should look for a more comprehensive alternative. The information this book provided on those topics are poor. Thus, I would recommend this \\"Dreamweaver MX Complete Course\\" for beginners who need to tackle one problem at a time.

The interest which the contents of this book arouse makes it an important text for developers and enthusiasts alike. Very few complaints will ever go against it. The only one I have is that it may not be too friendly with beginners.	2003-01-19

Other new additions include elaborated chapter on Performance Tuning; as well as expanded coverage of Vacation and Makemap. Every new option as regards the software (version 8.10 through 8.12) was included. At the same time, the simplistic outlook of the book remained unchanged.

Mr Wharfe refrained from revealing any &quot;close secret&quot; that is hitherto unknown.<br />If you cherish reading anything about Lady Di, you may enjoy this one. But, if you are interested in some new revelations, I doubt if this book will quench your appetite.<br />As is customary with our nature, Ken displayed a deep sympathy for the dead. He did his best in down-playing any of those embarrassing moments in Diana's life. Still, I would have liked to know the reason why the late Princess, who called attention to charity during her lifetime failed to include charitable donations in her will. Instead, she left her entire wealth for her sons, who are not only royal, but are already multi-millionaires.<br />My inference is that the &quot;secrets&quot; in this book are so closely guarded that no reader will be able to come across them.	2003-01-15

I read it with enthusiasm, but at the same time, maintaining some reservations. The author seemed to be afraid in a way: he was reluctant to include the 'bad side' of  Washington (and some of his co-founding 'fathers' who featured in this book). Even when he dared, his style deteriorated: from being vague to being uncoordinated. Still, I enjoyed reading his book.<br />In contrast, I like being frank in assessing both men and materials. Mr Washington was indeed a freedom-fighter. But, in all honesty, he was a selfish one. I do not see any reason why a man who sought freedom to the extent of waging a war for it, would in turn, run a government that enslaved American Negroes and oppressed American Indians. Such a man is no hero to any unbiased mind. He is unjust, insensitive and self-centered. He would not do unto others as he would like others to do unto him. Another irony of winning freedom!<br />In this biographical evaluation, Richard Brookhiser 'forgot' to tell us the reason why this 'hero of freedom' turned around and denied other people of their (most basic) freedom. Willingly or unwillingly, George Washington mortgaged the lives of Negroes and Indians throughout his life. He would have been a true hero, had he opposed slavery and oppression, and worked towards achieving freedom and justice for all: regardless of skin-colour and ethnicity.	2003-01-08

Revising and updating this text would ensure that it ranks among the reliable yardsticks, which provide complete coverage of all the topics: organic, inorganic and physical.<BR>Another flaw that I found in this book is that it did not adhere to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemist, (IUPAC), nomenclature in many instances. This flaw will ensure that most students outside North America would not make it their first choice, when shopping for a chemistry text.	2003-01-08

But I'm glad that I didn't pay a dime for it. I borrowed it.<BR>Fascinating! How can Mr Morton be so obsequious? Did Monica bribe him alla Clinton? This book missed the mark. It is corroded by blind sympathy.<BR>The author 'forgot' that Miss Lewinski was the one who went after Mr Clinton (and not the other way round). She frequently loitered around in order to hook him. She was fully aware that the man was married: with a daughter close to her age. But, she was drugged by self-designed fantasies. She was hell-bent on 'experiencing' sex with Mr President: even if it boils down to endless adulteries. Yet, blind writers would want us to see how \\"innocent\\" and \\"young\\" she was. Who is fooling who?<BR>Who does not know that the U.S.A. has tried and executed under-18 \\"criminals\\" (as adults)? So, how do we explain all these noise about a \\"young\\" intern? Is a twenty-four year-old too young? Are we not kidding?<BR>Monica should pick-up courage and do the right thing. She should tender an unreserved apology to Hiliary and Chelsea: for all the embarrassment she brought about. She is as guilty as Mr Clinton: if not more! Both should ask God for forgiveness.<BR>Any potential reader of this book should read it with a pinch of salt. Bring a bag of salt if you can! Its story is in consonance with Monica's notorious insincerity. Don't let the author blind you with churned-up sympathy. It is undeserved. Open your eyes!	2003-01-05

I mean those who damn the consequences and pen-down the hard facts: whether the world likes it or not. J.J. Ellis is one of them; regardless of those nagging complaints that his pen attracted.<BR>Right from the first page, this book was purposeful. Unlike most other 'Jefferson' authors, Professor Ellis refused to tuck-in his tail and dance to the gallery. He understands that honesty may hurt for a short while, but, costs nothing in the end.<BR>Everything about his book is factual. No sycophantic element! Its portrayal of Thomas Jefferson was candid and conscientious.<BR>Yes, Mr Jefferson might have been one of America's 'founding fathers', but that does not make him a saint. In fact, he was a pariah when the issue concerns true freedom. He failed justice and betrayed compassion. Yes, he did.<BR>Among all the lies about his 'greatness', one thing is crystal-clear: Thomas Jefferson was a terrible contradiction, who never defended true freedom. Calling him an unrepentant racist may sound offensive, but that is what he was.<BR>How can a man who consistently preached (to the English Monarch), that, \\"All men were created equal: with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\"; turn around and entrench a slave-holding society: one of the most cruel societies that humanity has ever known?<BR>Good or bad, this biographer balanced his research well. He was more interested in the (bitter) truth than in pleasing sycophants.<BR>Thomas Jefferson was by no means better than his 'British oppressors'. That he repeatedly raped Black women did not show that he believed in true justice. That he bought, sold, and enslaved men, women and children did not show that he believed in true freedom. That he even went as far as enslaving his own (coloured) children simply because their skin-colour were not as White as he would have liked them to be did not show that he believed in human rights. None these facts showed that he was sincere in citing that \\"Allmen were created equal\\", nor that he agreed that \\"All men are entitled to freedom and the pursuit of happiness\\".<BR>It is time we abandon sectional bias and sentiments, and open our eyes. An evil-deed is an evil-deed, whether we like it or not: and regardless of who did it, or when and where it was done. Slavery is evil. It ruined justice; ruined freedom; ruined happiness; ruined love; and ruined lives. It is epitome of wickedness. Nobody who condoned and/or participated in it is truly great.<BR>If we insist otherwise, then, what are we going to tell diehards who believe that Saddam Hussein is a great man? What are we going to tell fanatics who believe that Osama Bin-Laden is a champion? And the last but never the least, what are we going to tell Neo-Nazis who adore Adolf Hitler as their hero?<BR>Mr Jefferson was only good at removing specks from the eyes of Britons, while refusing to remove the mahogany logs that blinded him and his co-founding 'fathers'.<BR>He enslaved and maltreated people for life, and throughout his life. Even in death, he refused to free those slaves; instead, he willed them out (as slaves). No conscientious being will classify this act as that of a freedom-preaching great man.<BR>This book was very kind to Mr Jefferson. It only called a spade by its real name.	2002-12-31

This book, &quot;Africa on a Shoestring, 9th Ed&quot; has a broad coverage; although its chapters are not as detailed as many tourists would expect them to be.<BR>Again, this book would have been of better psychic value, had its authors showed confidence in the sections they dealt with. Its 'information' became a wet blanket for me. Many readers who intend to visit African countries are likey to be discouraged by its relentless pessimistic approach. Its outlook is more critical than 'touristical'. The general impression is this: &quot;something good may not come out of Africa&quot;. That is shameful! The term &quot;bush-taxi&quot;, which was used over and over again, in lieu of a more cordial 'local-taxi' sounds offensive.<BR>I think that if written (or revised) without assumptive bias, this book would be of better quality and value to its users.	2002-12-20

Many date-sensitive facts in this new edition are just too old. They are in dire need of updating!<BR>Also, since more than half of its contents are about the U.S., it may not be easy to convince non-Americans of its global outlook.

Well-illustrated maps and superb index are among its strongest qualities. But note that the single European currency, Euro, came into circulation a year after the publication of this Second Edition. As a result, all the prices in the E.U. zone are listed in the outdated pre-Euro currencies of individual nations.

Minimal features and stunted flexibility ensured that the potentials of this NSOED e-book cannot be fully exploited. It is hard to understand the reason why an esteemed publisher like the Oxford University Press, (OUP), chose to deprive consumers of the complete joy that this CD would have offered. The poor accessibility options they included in it is annoying. That is the reason why I mistook it for an imitation (i.e.: a faked version). But it is the real thing! OUP confirmed it when I complained via phone. This is quite unlike the print version. Quite unlike other OUP products!

The North accuses the South of having been too tenacious on slavery, and the South accuses the North of hypocrisy, insisting that she (the North), started it in the first place: by disguising the first slaves whom she brought (in 1619) to New Amsterdam (the present day New York) as \\"indentured servants\\".<BR>Surely, the guilty are afraid and ashamed; but that changes nothing.

Although that I doubt some of the things written in this biography, I commend Nick Tosches for his great effort. Some issues surrounding Sonny's life may never be resolved.<BR>I was not thrilled some years ago, when I learnt that the epitaph of this great champion read:<BR>\\"Charles Sonny Liston: A Man.\\"<BR>Although I respect that statement, I still maintain that it is not befitting enough. Sonny was not just a man. He was, and as of today, still the only heavyweight to have won the World Undisputed Championship in just one round. In 1962, he blew away the then (two-time) champion, Floyd Patterson, in just (two minutes and ten seconds of) the first round. He repeated this feat in the subsequent rematch he gave (challenger) Patterson.<BR>Although taller and a bit heavier, Sonny Liston was the Mike Tyson of the 1960s. He tamed every contender except Muhammad Ali (known then as Cassius Clay). And, I disagree with this biographer, Floyd Patterson, and others who insinuate that Liston \\"threw\\" that fight (in 1964) to Ali. Not at all! Everything was real. The videotape/DVD is still in the market, (including Amazon.com). It made it very clear. No doubt; no question! Ali won the fight. He dethroned Liston.<BR>But Liston's loss took little away from his intimidating reputation. Till today, every pundit acknowledges that he was a great champ. Ali did so too; and described him with these scary words:<BR>\\"I used to watch Liston, although his managers would not let me train with him. He was everything they said he was: a mass of muscles, power and force. His bare fists measured a fantastic fourteen inches round the knuckles, and needed specially made gloves to cover them. He was the King-Kong of boxing: a human destroyer. On the scale of dinosaurs, Sonny Liston would be the biggest and the baddest that ever shook the ground: the brontosaurus.\\"<BR>Henry Cooper, then among the heavyweight top contenders, who (although failed to win the crown) ranks among the best heavyweights that Britain has produced, once said: \\"I simply refused to fight Sonny Liston in any circumstance.\\"<BR>Similar things have been said and written about the late champ. Whoever knew him well, knew that he was not just a man. He was, and will always be more than that. Nick's research on him was interesting; although that I still maintain my reservations.	2002-12-16

It reminds one of Alex Haley's \\"Roots\\". Both stir emotions. Every bit of the story shows how cruel a man can be to his fellow man. And, I disagree with all those who term this true story \\"a story of illegally enslaved Africans\\", (Mr Spielberg didn't). We are shying away from the truth, which is that no African, (not even one), was a legal slave. There is nothing that made one slave legal, and the other illegal. There is no legality in slavery. Absolutely! That treacherous and heartless people overpowered, kidnapped, and transported, (in the most inhumane manner), their fellow human beings to America and other places does not, in any way, make those victims of inhumanity \\"legal slaves\\". Regardless of all the face-saving tales that those who defiled our lands with the innocent blood, tears, and sweat of millions of Africans will like us to believe, the truth is that not even a single African volunteered to become a slave in any circumstance. They were all forced into it: with no option but death. Those who ripped and enjoyed the bloodied fruits of slavery merely sought cheap excuses in order to justify what they did. But we know that there is nothing legal in kidnapping and subjecting human beings to such a horrible condition.<BR>'La Amistad' tells a soul-eroding story. Cinque and his cohorts are true heroes. They are heroes of freedom, heroes of justice, and heroes of human rights. Songs have been composed about them. Books have been written about them. Films have been made about them. And, history will forever appreciate their gallantry.	2002-12-16

Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).<BR>However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.<BR>One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).<BR>In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.<BR>That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \\"Up From Slavery\\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \\"offensive write-up\\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \\"critical\\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.<BR>Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \\"lacked depth\\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.<BR>An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \\"Up From Slavery\\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world.	2002-12-11

Each topic consists of an array of smooth-flowing information, which are buttressed by supportive charts and diagrams. Even the otherwise complex immunochemistry topics were dissected in details, and without pain. This textbook will encourage any immuno-phobic beginner, while at the same time provide lifelines for those in need of revision.

It is one book that calls morality to question. The story it tells is just one out of the millions most Black Americans of his era (and beyond) developed immunity to hearing. It is a sweet sad story; and every page of the book seem to ask: Where has justice gone? I couldn't give an answer, but I know one thing for sure: Freedom was faraway, and compassion was nowhere to be found.<BR>Yes, like every other society, there are two people in the U.S.A.: the good ones and the bad ones. Given the nation's racially charged history, I can understand the reason why \\"freedom and justice\\" are among the most common phrases that feature in every Presidential Speech. History clearly shows that the United States of America deliberately deprived herself of both true freedom and true justice. The reason for this being that the country showed more interest in the skin-colour of her denizens than in the contents of their character.<BR>Permit me to add this: I have always been a vocal supporter of Capital Punishment: as a deterrent for heinous crimes. But, the fact that justice has been, and are still being perverted on a daily basis (has since) doused my support for Death Penalty. My conscience never tires to remind me that many unfortunate 'Rubin Carters' have been put to death solely because of their skin-colour, and never because they actually did what they were accused of doing. These unfortunate souls were never champions. They were never celebrated. Their transitions went unheralded, but God kept the count. The human heart is desperately wicked! We have soiled our hands, and have polluted our lands with innocent blood. Our wickedness is worse than stench!<BR>Well, there is no point crying over spilled milk. The most reasonable thing for us to do now is to change. We have to seek true penance, true repentance, before seeking the forgiveness of God. We owe these to God, and to all our victims.

Everything about the book depicted that gentleness that was his off-ring trademark. Yes, Color-Bar affected him like any other Black person of his generation, but he took it along in his strides. It is only the grace of God that transformed this poor sharecropper's son into one of the most famous persons of the 20th Century.<BR>His record of 12-year reign as a champion, backed-up by an equally outstanding 25 title defences is still a burning candle that no heavyweight has been able to extinguish. I am only saddened by the fact that (American) racism (in those days, and to some extent today) did its best to hinder those credentials; as well as the joy that the post-ring gentleman deserved. May his soul Rest In Peace!	2002-12-06

Nobody exalted sports the way he did. Muhammad Ali is a living phenomenon: an institution. He is the most enduring legacy sports will ever have. Not just because he tamed formidable dinosaurs like Sonny Liston and George Foreman, but because of the way he comported himself: both in and out of the sporting arena.<BR>Ali is the main reason why there is so much money in sports today. Nobody will ever define sports the way he did.	2002-12-06

The name of this book remains the sweetest part of it. I am sorry to say that Sam Wellman did not impress me with his story. The 208 pages he wrote were dull and dragging. It is a far cry from the thriller I expected. His account of Nightingale's early life was okay; but that of her later nursing career, which brought her prominence, was not well relayed. His book has a fine topic, but lacked the type of presentation I expected. I think that Val Webb did a better job in his book, (with similar title).	2002-12-06

It is much more simplified here!<BR>This book is the Sybex classical. It is truly complete. My only wish is that Sybex should start attaching e-books to all her series: in the form of CD-ROMs; even if it means increasing the price a bit.

All are welcomed; although I would add that this particular version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; seems to be the most 'original' I have come across. It is quite detailed, and has all the flavours of 19th century English.<br />However, for most leisure readers who just want to have fun, I will recommend the Mass Market Paperback version. Its story is more abridged: more direct; and boasts of the contemporary English we use today.	2002-12-01

Dr. Martin Luther King's collection of writings and speeches, \\"I Have A Dream\\", brings aspiration to light. The events that surrounded the life and death of this true hero reveals the shameful fact that no matter how great the United States of America is today, it is one country that was nurtured with inhumane machinery: slavery, racism, injustice, Mickey-Mouse freedom, and Mickey-Mouse democracy. I hate to think about it, but it is an honest fact, which  we should all come to terms with. Nobody can rewrite history.<BR>The 256 pages that is \\"I Have A Dream\\" was enough to highlight the wickedness and the violence that were deliberately sustained in America, for a full century, after a bloody Civil War ended her tenacity on slavery.<BR>One question that will always beg for answer is: How on earth did U.S. Presidents who presided over the ruthless color-bar era qualified for those Nobel Peace Prizes that they received? Knowing what life was like in the U.S.A. just a couple of decades ago melts my heart. \\"I Have A Dream\\" is a big eye-opener!	2002-11-28

From installation and configuration to multimedia and networking (including Service Pack 1), the book took care of both Professional and Home editions of Windows XP.

It is straightforward, and sells at a newspaper's price. However, its biggest sin is that it is less up-to-date, and offers little when compared to other books like the \\"Complete Guide to Prescription & Non-prescription Drugs\\".	2002-08-07

It offers detailed information on both practical and theoretical aspects of the subject. Its authority is unquestionable. Pathologists, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and anybody whose business concerns infectious diseases will find the book useful.<BR>The only setback is that it is awkwardly expensive. Many potential buyers would be enticed by cheaper alternatives: there are lots of them out there.	2002-08-02

The PC HARDWARE IN A NUTSHELL is one computer book that tried to bridge the gap between a beginner's hardware knowledge and that of an advanced user or learner. It provided detailed information in a chronological 'nutshell' format. Every aspect of a typical Pentium and Windows-based system received luxurious dissection. There are also valuable purchasing and troubleshooting tips.<BR>However, like most U.S. PC books, this one didn't come cheap. Less than expected information were apportioned to non-Intel and non-Microsoft items. Again, the fact that the authors advertised certain trademarks over and over again, in the course of providing shopping tips, made them a bit more self-serving (than the honest arbiters consumers expect them to be).	2002-07-28

Both doctors and patients have bestowed tremendous trust on this interactive resource.<BR>In order to make it to the top, this CD-ROM combined the strengths of other formidable TNM tools, namely: the &quot;TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours&quot;, the &quot;TNM Atlas&quot; and the &quot;TNM Supplement&quot;, which altogether enhanced its accuracy in prognosis and other patient care efforts. The only thing one may hold against this disc is that its user-flexibility qualities need facelifts.	2002-07-28

Both medics and medical scientists may find this software irresistible. Detailed diagnostic and therapeutic descriptions, which spanned across hundreds of diseases and disorders were provided in a clear and sequential order.<BR>The contents of this CD-ROM are updated annually, and although it would be nice to own the most recent copy, one would not be lagging too faraway with any issue that is not more than five years off the pace.	2002-07-28

It is an elaborate text whose popularity attests to its high quality.<BR>Good enough, the traditional use of simple descriptions were retained in this new edition, while additional efforts were made in order to simplify most of the complex issues associated with immunochemistry and immunopathology. This textbook is a one-volume knowledge base whose accurate differentials are largely due to extensive facts validations.	2002-07-17

It also has what it takes to lighten the yoke of even the most advanced learner.<BR>This book is a bundle of expanded information on pathophysiology.

The autobiography of the South African sage, Nelson Mandela, is one of the most captivating and intriguing book anyone can read.<BR>With the first page, it handcuffs you. You will gladly remain under arrest until you're through with the last page. Very few books generate such electromagnetic induction.<BR>Emotive, exuberant, and exhilarating, \\"Long Walk To Freedom\\" is a story of victory: triumph over hardship; over fear; and over man-inhumanity-to-man.

It covered the most important areas of human toxicology, and gave detailed insight into their respective chemistry and biochemistry.<BR>As with all other polymorphic sciences, information is endless. This CD-ROM serves as an ideal cache. All remarkable 'toxic developments' are included; and regular updates, (which may appear annually) ensure that the contents are revised and current. The e-book has a wide range of features. It is easy to use, although flexibility for the mobile professional is not particularly enhanced.	2002-07-03

If you are a computer novice, (we all once were), then this book may be a good starting point. It is straightforward and beautifully illustrated. It also offers brief historical evolution of both computers and computer components. However, its high cost takes away the shine. There are several cheaper options in the market.<BR>Another sour point is that the attached interactive CD-ROM falls into coma quite often. It will give you an impressive virtual reality tour if it remains healthy; but may not respond to all the conventional revival you may apply, if digital epilepsy grabs it.	2002-06-30

Anybody that is interested in this book will benefit from its extensive coverage of all aspects of pharmacology, including cogent information on pharmacognosy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacotherapeutics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology.<BR>The authors did their job well: they had taken care in establishing this masterpiece into a reference top-gun. Worth pointing out is the comprehensive coverage given to Maternal/Foetal Medicine, Neuro-diseases' Therapy, as well as general pharmacology as it concerns Intensive Care.	2002-06-17

Concise and clinically relevant, Sherris Medical Microbiology is more than just an introductory text. It harbours abundant information that will interest anyone with a career in healthcare. The book paid total tribute to all aspects of pathogenic bacteriology, mycology, virology, parasitology, and immunology. Simple and clear explanations were used throughout.<BR>However, at this level, one would be disappointed that Sherris has lost touch with being up-to-date. As a result, the excellent (4th edition of) Medical Microbiology by Murray, et al, has relegated Sherris' efforts to that of a second fiddle. It offers a better value for money; and boasts of the most up-to-date information currently on sale.	2002-06-11

This 21st edition on CD-ROM exhibits Cecil's wealth of experience in a manner that will make its contemporaries to sulk with envy. It is not just the best in terms of providing succinct information, but also in terms of contents organisation. This CD-ROM remains the 'numero uno' multimedia Textbook of Medicine if flexibility of use is your priority.<BR>The only minus this book has is that it is not as thorough (in scope) as Kelley's text is.	2002-06-03

This 3,200 pages of sound medical gospel is an all-round platinum winner.<BR>It is a pacesetter in outlook: covering all branches of medicine in a veridicous way that is worthy of emulation.<BR>If the current pace established by the 4th edition is sustained in the future, Kelley's will completely douse competition from both the Cecil's and the Harrison's texts.<BR>It is hard to find flaws in this book; and I believe that many people would like to see what its CD-ROM version will look like.	2002-05-29
