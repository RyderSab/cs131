The author obviously adores Freudian psychologist Melanie Klein, and uses her preposterous theories (such as how babies are born with destructive impulses as a result of \\"fighting their way\\" out of the womb) to explain George W's neuroses.  Skip the Freudian nonsense, though, and you will get to the heart of the matter:  whatever way you analyze him, the President is a paranoid, learning-disabled, \\"dry\\" alcoholic with delusions of grandeur.  Very scary indeed.	2005-10-03

Ms. Kirino writes such an intense, involving, scary tale (not for the squeamish!) that I don't know if I would have the nerve to meet her in person.  The female characters are at once mundane, complex and fearless as they are caught up in a nightmarish world of crime, deception and murder.  This one is hard to forget, and I want to read more by Natsuo Kirino; she's the real deal.	2005-09-19

The slight touch of the magic and the supernatural really adds to what is otherwise a realistic-type story.  Not only could I not put it down, I immediately ordered volumes two and three from Amazon.com before I hit the last 200 pages.  A superior read in every way, and perhaps will appeal to those who do not care for fantasy novels.  Enjoy this sumptuous feast!	2005-08-16

Alas, his first novel in the SPQR series has turned me away.  The writing is good, but the author spends too much time with \\"info. dumping,\\" the characters are sometimes poorly developed, especially the protagonist, and the reader can see the bad guys coming a mile away.  Even the book's title offers a clue to the situation.  Oh well, at least I tried.	2005-08-08

While Simmons is still a great writer, the tale becomes a bit silly and ungainly, with many of the major characters coming off as stereotypes.  The Setebos character especially seems like a malevolent cartoon.  By story's end, there is nothing going on, as if the characters, like the author, has run out of steam.  The final scene seems like something out of Mr. Rogers.  Please, Mr. Simmons, no sequel to Olympos.	2005-08-02

For that is what Specimen Days feels like: a creative writing project that hits more often than misses.  The first story is hard to get into but ends on a transcendent note and is quite involving.  The second is also well done, with an ending that is unexpected and terrifying.  The final story, though, is a bit weak.  Cunningham has never tried science fiction before, and Like Beauty is a bit stilted and has some inherent problems (also, it's too much like a Blade Runner concept).  However, Specimen Days is well worth reading, and any book that makes me want to go back and read a poet like Walt Whitman is worthy of recognition.	2005-06-20

I have to laugh at critics who call Karnazes egotistical; you have to have an enormous amount of self-confidence and yes, ego, to accomplish the things he has.  And as far as slighting other ultramarathoners (especially females) I say, get over it.  The man is writing about himself and his experiences; it's not a research project.  I think there are two possible reactions to this book: one is to be in awe of this man's abilities and the other is to be jealous of him.

The \\"big surprise\\" which appears midpoint in the novel can be anticipated well in advance, and the \\"coincidental\\" appearance of a character later on tests the reader's limits of credulity, not to mention the sickeningly sweet, trite ending.

The prose is flat (not spare) and the characters are painfully lifeless, reduced to making a series of gestures and comments that never come to life on the page, nor in this reader's mind.

There are many faults that could be pointed out in this work, but there are many wonderful moments as well.

I am amazed at the lack of publicity In the City has received.  Unique characters that you come to care for as flesh and blood beings and wonderous language make for one of the deepest and most tender novels I've ever read.

Her work reminds me of Tennessee Williams at times.  This novel deals with an old judge, his grandson and the presence of his dead son, a young Black man, and a pharmacist who is dying of leukemia.  There is a revelation near the end of the story concerning the link between most of the characters, but it seems odd considering the Judge's personality and value systems.  The last chapter, however, which concerns the pharmacist's worsening illness, is transcendant.  An uneven McCullers tale is certainly better than none at all.	2004-12-23

The reader is never quite sure what is going to happen next, and the ending is a bit abrupt, but there is little doubt about where the two main characters are headed, at least in my mind.  A great page turner, this is the kind of novel that will appeal to those of varying tastes.  Highly recommended.	2004-12-23

This is annoying, as I have not read all of Dick's works.  Therefore, I had to skip the parts where the synopses were inserted.  Secondly, the author states that he read too many books to mention.  That's funny, as most biographers have no problem citing their sources.  We could at least have had a bibliography here.  Third, the author injects a LOT of speculation about Dick's state of mind, which is interesting but not in any way reliable as biographical material.  I did, though, enjoy the philosophical explanations of some of Dick's theories, especially the discussion of The Man in the High Castle, Dick's masterwork.

The Dark Tower VII is nothing but empty plot set up so that King can steer his characters to their ultimate fates, and includes lots of silly, meaningless prose.  The character of Mordred is disgusting, not scary, and The Red King is a cartoon.  And why does Roland start calling everyone \\"dear\\"?  It's obvious that King had no clue as to how to proceed here and couldn't even do a fair job of it.  Please, no sequels!  Read something intelligent instead of this series, like Gene Wolfe's Books of the New Sun.  The finale of the Dark Tower series is only good for a doorstop.

With that in mind, it is not unlikely that a character like Frankie would develop and suffer the anguish of growing up.  This complex novel would be better left to adults and not forced upon children in high school, for I can see how they would be frustrated in trying to read it.  Anyway, this novel was apparently made into a play, and the book reads like one, with the three central characters taking center stage.

The insertion of the author is both intrusive (King acting as his own deus ex machina) and thought-provoking (tieing in with the concept of many different worlds and acting as a commentary on the author as creator).  The real disappointment is the ending, where Susannah-Mia find themselves in a \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" type scenario which is way too silly and overly dramatic.

Carroll is supposed to be this great fantasy writer who has a cult following.  All I can say is, keep them away from me!

But, of course, no mention is made of the fact that Spencer and Katherine were having an affair and no hint of the &quot;A&quot; word (adultery).  This is a cleaned up version of reality, but nonetheless ceaselessly entertaining.  Tracy, however, comes off as he usually does:  melancholy, dark, and troubled.  Only Kanin's affection for him redeems Tracy in the reader's eyes.  The parts about Hepburn are the real treat here; she must have been a riot to have as a friend.	2004-01-30

The characters come across as fully-formed, and the writing is seamless. The plot inexorably leads to its stunning conclusion, and we return to find our ka-tet continuing on its journey.

In places, the action and plotting seem a bit too much like a comic book, and the character development is a little weak.  Roland, Eddie and Susannah don't come off as three-dimensional as in the last book, and the character of Jake has gone from a mysterious, compelling young man to an innocent schoolboy who makes us fear for his safety.  The haunted house section was way out of place in this tale, and threw the whole story out of whack.  King could have invented a better plot device here.  Still, in parts the story is still strong and hypnotic, and I plan to continue along the journey to the Tower.	2004-01-14

I was amazed at how he deftly took so many disparate settings and characters and brought them all together.  I won't comment on anything specific, because I don't want to spoil anything for the reader.  It's best to come to this series with no knowledge of what is going to occur.  Only one gripe:  schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder are two different things.  Schizophrenics do NOT have more than one personality, but rather have one that is fragmented.  King deserves 50 lashes with a wet noodle for this big-time mistake.  However, all is forgiven due to a tale that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.	2004-01-05

What it really is is the story of a most unusual girl growing up in an atmosphere of dysfunction, whether it be within her own family or that of the white trash neighbors.  Tartt's prose is mesmerizing, and I love her use of themes (dreams, sleeping, water and rain, etc.) that keep the narrative tied together.  Most interesting is the author's refusal to give many of her characters a cut-and-dried type of morality.  And yes, in a tongue-in-cheek way, Harriet is a genius.	2003-12-18

Although some of the sections of this novel seem contrived (i.e., the \\"coincindental\\" reappearance of some of the characters, Middlesex is delightful, touching, wise and truthful.  Like Cal, it is much more than the sum of its parts, and the reader will come away with mixed emotions, but all of them will be from having experienced literature that strives to do what all good literature does:  hold a mirror up to the way we live and love.	2003-11-24

It covers practically all things of concern to human beings:  the passage of time, mortality, memory and the past, love of life, contemplation of the Earth and the universe and so much more.  The section &quot;written&quot; by Hand turns the novel into a tour de force, as it confronts the reader by questioning the very nature of what narrative, fiction and non-fiction means to us.  On the superficial level (and I hate to use that word here), YSKOV deals with our quest to find meaning in our lives by forcing ourselves upon it, and with how often we, sadly, fail to do so.  This is a awe-inspiring work of fiction.  I'd like to hand out copies of it on the street.  Eggers is one of the best writers of this very young twenty-first century.	2003-11-12

The title tale features one of King's most original characters, and takes the reader inexorably to its mid-air conclusion.  &quot;The Death of Jack Hamilton&quot; concerns John Dillinger and his gang, and is a masterful story devoid of anything supernatural, attesting to the universality of King's talents as a writer.  &quot;L.T.'s Theory of Pets&quot; is a story with great dialogue, but the ending fizzles out, just like &quot;Luckey Quarter.&quot;  &quot;1408,&quot; though, is truly disturbing and &quot;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is In French&quot; is a suffocating Satre-like account of a woman who slowly realizes what kind of fate has befallen her.

A very detailed and informative history of death care in our society is laid out here, but the reading becomes repetitive and boring due to the fact that, as mortal beings, we cannot come to resolve issues about death.  Topics such as embalming, the moral character of funeral directors, the viewing of the body, and the role of religion seem to be things that throughout the decades we are always circling around but never really confronting.  Therefore, the same debates keep coming up on the same subjects.  The most important point I take from this book is that we will never come to terms with death, but will always be psychologically held prisoners by the thought of it.	2003-09-04

The world the author creates is bizarre and ingenious, but she seems to do little with it other than to warn against genetic experimentation.  It lacks moral punch and is interesting only for its inventiveness and use of language.  The character of Oryx seems more like a convenient plot device, and the novel would not suffer without her.  However, nothing that comes from the pen of Atwood is ever totally without merit.  I expect mixed reactions from readers of this book	2003-08-26

The protagonist Lark was unfortunate enough to have experienced both the huge loss of many friends to the initial AIDS epidemic and the present-day reality of the fragmentation of gay culture.  As always, Holleran's prose is touching and wonderful; his Dancer From the Dance is my favorite gay novel.	2003-08-23

Stories by Kress, Finlay, Gloss, McHugh, Sterling and others simply lack the creative spark that excites or provokes the reader.  I finished many of these stories and said to myself, &quot;So what?&quot;  Just because one is a good writer does not automatically mean one produces good stories.  Even John Kessel's gender-dystopia &quot;Stories for Men&quot; ends too abruptly to do this wonderful tale justice.<br />Some gems are to be found here, however.  Ian R. MacLeod's &quot;Breathmoss&quot; is intricate and surprising, an entire universe in fifty pages.  Robert Reed's &quot;Coelacanths&quot; is daring and provocative.  Ian McDonald's &quot;The Old Cosmonaut...&quot; is elegant and lyrical.  James Van Pelt's &quot;A Flock of Birds&quot; shows the appearance of hope in a very unusual way when the world is literally falling apart, and Eleanor Arnason's &quot;The Potter of Bones&quot; is bold and stimulating.  I enjoyed less than half of these stories, my lowest score yet for this excellent annual collection.  Hope things improve by next July.	2003-08-03

Nancy Johnston's \\"The Rendez-Vous\\" deals with a woman who may or may not be the victim of nocturnal alien abductions.  Kathleen O'Malley's \\"Silent Passion\\" shows us that even beings from another planet can teach us a thing or two about humanity.  Charles Sheffield's \\"Brooks Too Broad for Leaping\\" is a surprisingly shocking view of what it would be like if the only place for gays and lesbians were the military.  Elisabeth Vonarburg's \\"Stay Thy Flight\\" is the true gem here: a story almost incomprehensible in the beginning which goes on to depict a form of life we could never imagine, and how it is drawn to a human female.  A thought-provoking anthology in the truest sense of the word.	2003-07-13

Read it so you can tell everyone else how amazing it is!  I look forward to Mr. Morgan's next Kovacs novel.

In truth, she is both, and this book contains a great deal of historical and political information concerning the Middle Eastern countries.  I am not surprised to see some negative reviews of this book; it must come as a shock to some readers to realize that we do not live in a black and white world.  The governments of America and Israel are not always altruistic in their behavior, nor is the culture of the Middle East &quot;uncivilized&quot; in relation to other cultures, and we are foolish if we choose to think so.  I was moved by Her Majesty's account of her loving relationship with King Hussein and their devotion to the cause of peace.

Dr. Gawande writes of the grand successes and the human imperfections of the science of medicine, and shows us how both doctors and patients are involved in the quest for improving health and saving lives.  Would you consider a chapter discussing nausea and vomiting to be of interest?  Dr. Gawande makes even this unappealing topic unbelievably informative and riveting.

The relationship between Jacob and Ferris is incredibly compelling and three-dimensional, as is the rest of this astounding first novel.  The reader is submerged in the story completely and by the story's end is still left longing for more.

The last third of the novel loses momentum, and the ending is much too open and refuses to suggest answers to some major questions about self-determination and humankind's place in the Universe.  Also, if the alien culture is so similar to India's and the Hindu religion, why didn't that culture become the dominant one on Earth?  This is a wonderfully original story that loses power like a balloon running out of air.  I wish I could rate it higher, but its flaws bring it down to a level of only above average.	2003-02-21

This is one of those rare books that deserves more than five stars.  I know little about the time period involved, yet I was caught up in the story nonetheless.

The resolutions and explanations at the end were fine and mostly unexpected, and I am neither happy nor unhappy with the way they were presented.  The only thing that really annoyed me was Williams' habit of ending many, many scenes with one or a group of characters losing consciousness, or everything fading to black; it was the only badly-handled aspect of the series.

Volume 2 is even more exciting and complex than the first one, and the characters become more sympathetic and realistic.  I am amazed by the diffirent virtual worlds that the author creates and explores, and the various literary and cultural references are fun to watch out for (see if you can find the quotation from the movie Blade Runner).  Of course, upon finishing this book, I immediately picked up Volume 3.  Onward through Otherland!	2003-01-06

The story practically tells itself, and one can hardly detect the author's presence anywhere in the narrative.  Each chapter is a world onto itself, and I for one do not consider reading fiction this good a waste of time!  A tour de force of the imagination - thanks, Mr. Williams.	2002-12-30

Some are mundane, some are shocking, some are tender and some are thought-provoking.  It would be great to see a follow-up volume written by not-so-famous gay men, just to see what would result.  I suspect the same kind of wisdom, love and heartache would be present.  Required reading for all fathers and all gay men.	2002-12-22

Just thought I'd give it a try.  This is a great novel that works on many levels, from the linguistic, analytical perspective to the suspenseful, quaint type of narrative to the terrifying, dystopian warning that all should heed and do everything in their power to prevent.

Fox; he's the kind of guy you want to hug, laugh and shoot the breeze with.  His winning personality comes through in this unforgettable account of his life from childhood to fame to his diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.  He understands that everyone is special, and that everyone has a story to tell.  His story, despite all his adversities, is inspiring in the true sense of the word.  The world is a better place because he has written such a funny, sensitive and touching memoir.  Lucky for all the P.D.-affected individuals that he has written it, and lucky for the rest of us too.  I cherish every minute I spent reading this book.  If you ever see him, give him a hug for me.	2002-11-27

I think he does an excellent job of showing us an individual weighed down by the enormous weight of a virtual family of icons but who, nevertheless, strived to make a place for himself in the world.  John comes off as an imperfect human being who nevertheless showed grace under pressure more often than not.  It is also easy to see the admiration the author had for his subject.

What he does give us is a series of vignettes which are laid out in a pattern like this:  Chet plays at this club/records this album, Chet shoots up drugs, Chet uses and abuses others, repeat until death.  Most of the information given either relates to the jazz world or comes from the interviews given to those who know and loved Chet.  It is amazing to think that such beautiful music came from a man so tormented, addicted and hateful, and it is remarkable that Chet Baker lived as long as he did.  I love his music, but had no idea that his life was such a nightmare.  This book is not for the faint-hearted, for it grows more dark and dismal with every page.  I plan to concentrate on his music from here on in.	2002-11-17

Even readers who don't believe in Sylvia Browne and her psychic powers and esoteric philosophy will enjoy the majority of this book, for it contains a lot of sensible, practical insights into the psychology of the subconscious mind.  Try it, and just skip the &quot;non-scientific&quot; parts if you wish; you will definitely get a lot of fascinating, useful information from reading this book.	2002-11-16

It was surprising to me that our country was not founded by a group of individuals with an &quot;all for one and one for all&quot; attitude, but came into being in the midst of much turmoil and diverse forces struggling for dominance.  Especially enlightening was the depiction of America's relationship to France as well as England, and the relationship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson is fascinatingly described.  Abagail Adams emerges as a woman who was equal, if not superior to, her husband is so many ways.  An incredibly rewarding biography, and worth putting at the top of your reading list.  Believe the hype-&quot;John Adams&quot; is a sublime read.	2002-11-01

I see themes of Whites and Black slavery, the relationships between parents and children, the universal process of coming to adulthood, the idea of dominance and submission in relationships, and our treatment of the other creatures on this earth which we call &quot;animals.&quot;  If we were not the &quot;dominant&quot; species on this planet, would we be treated like the mounts in this story?  I believe that we would.  And I wonder about something else:  If horses could speak, what would they tell us?  This is a disturbing story which does what all great literature does.  It changes us forever.	2002-10-14

What is most interesting is that most of the authors whose stories appear here are not citizens of a Latin American country only, but have lived in and experienced cultures from around the world.  One author, Anna Kazumi Stahl, is a German-Japanese who lives in Buenos Aires and writes in Spanish.<br />There are many gems here:  Carlos Franz's \\"Circle,\\" a beautiful and precise rendering of the cycle of life; Stahl's \\"Natural Disasters,\\" Carmen Posadas' vibrant and wise story of \\"The Nubian Lover,\\" wherein a woman and her ex-husband try to reconcile via a trip to Egypt; Javier Valdes' Stephen King-like \\"People Like Us,\\" a chilling story of a pair of lovers and their lust for material gain.  My favorite is Ernesto Mestre-Reed's \\"After Elian,\\" a brilliant story about an old woman dying of cancer who refuses to give up the desire to live despite the humiliations she may suffer.  All in all, a great collection to start exploring the many wonderful Latino authors currently at work contributing to the greater body of excellent world literature.	2002-10-13

The writing is quite good for a first novel, but the title character of Sarah is not even well-developed enough to be called two-dimensional.  She represents nothing and is nothing but a catalyst that brings disparate types of individuals together.  The ending is a mishmash of diverse philosphies and ridiculous scenes which seem forced and stilted.  Let this Canary fly away!	2002-10-06

A lifetime sci-fi fan, I believe this novel belongs on the top 100 list of the greatest of all time, if not the top 50.  The mind-numbing dystopia that Disch presents to the reader gets more convoluted and intense as the narrative goes on, with two fairly predictable twists and one final twist I'll wager you won't anticipate.  But be warned, this is not a book for lightweights.  There are tons of literary, cultural and religious references here, and they come at the reader fast and furious.  I earnestly look forward to more Disch; Camp Concentration is surely the work of a genius!	2002-10-06

Things get darker as Gordianus gets older, and his perspective on life changes with age.  I like to give myself a bit of time between these novels to &quot;cleanse my palate&quot; with other books, but this time I don't know how long I can hold out until picking up &quot;Massilia.&quot;  If you think you know how this one will turn out, you will be in for quite a shock.	2002-10-04

All of the general details are true, of course, but the author is quite a unique women, and though I think her memoirs are a must-read, she seems to be a person who remains a mystery to herself, and I wonder how and why she ever made some of the journeys she did under the conditions she had to endure.  I suppose she is the ultimate journalist:  able to get to the heart of others while never shining the light directly into her own being.  A thoroughly engrossing and transcendant read!	2002-10-04

The few characters that are not completely dysfunctional are of little help to the main character of Robin, who, at 13, tries unsuccessfully to find the smallest bits of hope and self-esteem surrounded by adults and peers who inflict nothing but pain upon him.  I was disappointed by the ending, which seemed like too much of a lightning-fast way to wrap things up.  Still, a well-crafted and involving story.  Avoid it, however, if you are looking for a feel-good novel:  this is not something that you will enjoy.  I wonder how the author could endure writing something so intensely sorrowful.	2002-09-29

He, along with the others of Flight 93, should never be forgotten for their ultimate act of bravery.

MacLeod's &quot;New Light on the Drake Equation' is lyrical and touching, but his second story, &quot;Isabel of the Fall&quot; seems meandering and pointless.  Michael Swanwick's &quot;The Dog Said Bow-Wow&quot; is outrageously entertaining.  &quot;Have Not Have&quot; is, I believe, part of Geoff Ryman's forthcoming novel &quot;Air,&quot; and is a story of an Asian/Muslim/Russian community on the brink of a worldwide technological breakthrough, filled with wonderful characters and great humor.  &quot;The Days Between&quot; by Allen M. Steele is an inevitably tragic tale with a peculiar twist, and Waldrop and Kennedy's &quot;One-Horse Town&quot; shows us the poignant intersecting of time and space.  Michael Blumlein's hyperkinetic, poetic, &quot;Know How, Can Do&quot; suggest that the human brain will remain the same no matter where you put it.  My favorite, however, is &quot;Russian Vine&quot; by Simon Ings, a haunting and exotic tale of how a conquering race of aliens make their victims illiterate in order to achieve their goals, a story so mesmerizing I just had to read it twice.  Words can't do the stories justice, and there are some clinkers here (Stross' much-praised &quot;Lobsters&quot; is very annoying), but overall this is the best buy in science fiction you're liable to get all year!  And we are especially proud that Mr. Dozois is a native Philadelphian!  I look forward eagerly to Collection number 20!	2002-09-15

Unfortunately, I only have three more to go.  What will I do then?  Gordianus is also getting a bit old at this point, so I hope that, when the time comes, Mr. Saylor will continue his Roman Sub Rosa series with Gordianus' son Eco taking his place as the Finder.  My only question is as to why the author seems to ignore the development of Eco's wife as a character - she is never given much attention.  These stories are totally involving and a great pleasure to read.  Start with the first one (Roman Blood) and keep going!	2002-08-27

This is truly one of the best works of fiction I have ever read.  The author gets everything right; each and every page is wise, funny and heartbreaking.  I read this book in less than 24 hours, have just finished it, and feel like I have been immeasurably enriched by the experience.  The characters are as real as you and I, and the author displays a talent for telling a story that few writers possess.

However, this is a terribly flawed work.  The author does not use quotation marks or &quot;he said&quot;s and &quot;she said&quot;s to indicate dialogue.  The effect is sometimes confusing and made me stop my reading and go back to verify who was saying what.  Also, both author and editor should know that the correct word used to describe a potential suitor is &quot;prospective&quot; and not &quot;perspective.&quot;  The plot begins to degenerate halfway through, with the author treating the characters and events like chess pieces which she awkwardly manipulates.  However, the worst offense is the ill-conceived ending, as Nurdane's actions in no way reflect what has gone before.  It seems like Ms. Payne takes a wonderful, flesh and blood cast of characters and turns them into cardboard cutouts.  I felt immensely disappointed with The Virgin's Knot, as Ms. Payne obviously has an enormous amount of talent.  Too bad she did not make consistent use of it.	2002-07-29

The author obviously has spent an immense amount of time and effort doing her research, and her way of telling the story of a life lived over 200 years ago is nothing less than remarkable.  For a week, I almost felt as though I were living a second life, one that I returned to every chance I could.  Ms. Fraser's work is a labor of love, and her way of drawing the reader into the totality of the milieu of 18th century France is magical.  I have not yet read the celebrated biography of John Adams, but I can hardly think that it surpasses this, by far the best biography I have read in thirty years.  Marie Antionette - The Journey deserves much wider recognition, and Ms. Fraser should be proud of her magnificent accomplishment.  It is truly an unforgettable book, and the French Queen and her story will remain with me always.	2002-07-17

Even though it is a fantasy, such a genre also has rules which the writer must follow, and Bridge of Birds reads like a big, frantic mess.  One deus ex machina follows another, and the author tries to cram characters and events into this story like rush hour riders into a Japanese subway car.  I only kept reading to find out how the story ended, and was glad when it was over.  Hughart is much better when he slows down and adopts a more lyrical pace which, unfortunately, is rarely.  Still, this book deserves three stars for the attempt.	2002-07-08

The stories written by acknowledged &quot;masters&quot; of the genre such as Le Guin, Disch, Kelly and Niven read like the kind of material these talented authors would never dream of submitting.  Joyce Carol Oates &quot;Commencement,&quot; her first sci-fi story, is extremely well-written but pointless.  If I were the editor of this collection, I would have sent the majority of stories back to the authors for rewrites.  There are a few gems, however.  New writer Laura Whitton's vibrant and challenging &quot;Froggies&quot; shows us what might happen if we come to care for another alien species a little too much, and Rucker and Shirley's &quot;Pockets&quot; is both mind-bending and terrifying.  I just wish Mr. Sarrantonio would have been a bit more discriminating in accepting stories for this collection.  Gardner Dozois' yearly collection is the one to read; even on off years, his choices are better than these.	2002-06-20

I am more of a fan of ancient Rome than of mysteries, but the characters in this series are so remarkably well-depicted and the overall experience of reading these books is so pleasurable I would recommend them to anyone.  Saylor does a superb job of bringing this time period to life while using his own imagination to create the fictional characters who live in it.

This is an amazing collection of stories, with characters and situations that are wildly imaginative and testosterone-laden (that goes for the female characters too!).  Your Own Backyard is my favorite, a frantic but insightful tale of how a father finds himself trying to connect with his adolescent son, and The Canadanaut, the most bizarre story here, is just plain laugh-out-loud funny.  My only reservation is with most of the endings; the author, in attempting to show that there really is no end to the stories of our lives, has a habit of cutting the ending short, which leaves the reader puzzled and frustrated.  Still, a minor complaint about the most entertaining and thoughtful prose I've read in a long time.  I look forward to more by Mr. Johnson.	2002-05-25

The &quot;historical sections&quot; are absolutely mesmerizing and show us that, despite his flaws, Gaiman really is a born storyteller.  If his next novel is better than this one, Mr. King's career is over!	2002-05-20

Lehane is a master at showing the tragedy of life, of the terrible mistakes we make and of how repentance often comes too late.  I was hypnotised as I read this book, and whenever I put it down it took me a while to adjust to the real world around me; Mystic River is that powerful.  Lehane deserves to be recognized by a larger audience, and I hope he one day gets his due.	2002-04-19
US	49175051	RPZYSVMEAQIPK	0380974576	916671943	Nekropolis	Books	2	5	11	N	N	A Wonderful Recipe Only Half-Baked	I don't know if it's fair to review a book that one has not read completely, but I had to put down Nekropolis despite all the good things I have read about it...  The author introduces us to an artificially constructed man, and can't seem to make up her mind whether he has no human emotions, some of them, or all of them.  McHugh also confuses us with the idea of jessing, where one is biochemically and emotionally linked to another, then treats such a supposedly strong bond as if it were weak and easily breakable.  Also, the romantic story here is forced for the sake of the plot.  I put it down before too long, unwilling to suspend my disbelief.  Sadly, this story needed another revision before publication.	2001-12-27

US	49175051	R1HSYTPQP40HU4	0385475721	850910906	The Blind Assassin	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Atwood's Flawed Masterwork	This is an amazing novel, and I very much wanted to give it five stars, but the plot and some of the characterizations were surprisingly weak and disjointed.  However, by no means should you pass up the chance to read The Blind Assassin!  Atwood is clearly at the top of her form here, and her command of the language is nothing short of stunning.  Her way of setting a mood, describing small details and employing simile and metaphor make for those small, literary epiphanies that true readers long for!  Read this and experience the author's incredible gift for language.	2001-08-10
US	49175051	R2YULSBC4Z4L2B	0375724834	352044771	Motherless Brooklyn	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A Novel That Really Deserves a Sequel	I have read some of Lethem's other works and found them to be unsatisfying, but Motherless Brooklyn is a one-of-a-kind novel, with a main character that turned out to be even more sympathetic that I expected.  The whodunit detective story that is the background of this work is only OK, but Lethem's writing and his protagonist Lionel Essrog leave a major impression.  Touching without being sentimental, this is the story of a physically flawed yet three-dimensional human being, and I only wish that the author would write a sequel so I could be assured that Lionel gets the happy ending he deserves.  An unusual literary treat that had a remarkable effect on this reader!	2001-06-14
US	49175051	R2I5AELE9M3YF	1885983409	256170784	Lawnboy	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Plague of Dysfunctional Families	Midway through this book, I became discouraged, because it seemed as though I was reading yet another of the endless stream of novels and stories dealing with dysfunctional families (it does get you down,  eventually).  However, since art does imitate life, I began to wonder how  many of these retellings of our own dysfunctional lives it will take before  people realize that, in what should be the loving confines of a family, we  abuse and/or neglect each other, eventually turning out adults who are full  of hate and pain.  Perhaps this type of literature should have a genre all  its own, and should proliferate until the message is heard.<br />Despite it  all, I was relieved as I continued to read this novel, became more  sympathetic to Evan and rejoiced in the author's belief that all it may  take is just a kernel of hope and contrary optimism to help one live one's  life free of the negative influences of others.  &quot;Lawnboy&quot; is  ultimately well worth the pain of reading, well-told and subtly beautiful  in its own right.	2000-07-24
