US	52273646	R12V06KNF6ZIUE	0688077587	78803576	Thinking on Paper	Books	2	21	23	N	N	The very basics of logic, grammar, and writing strategy	The title, positive reviews, and Harvard affiliation of the authors was enough to make this book sound intriguing. <br />I must say that that I was astonished by the slenderness of the content.  In this 150 page volume, the last third is dedicated to an overview of grammar and punctuation, covering basics which almost anyone expecting to be an author probably learned in middle school - or would have in any of several basic writing manuals. <br />Within the remaining 100 pages the authors do present an interesting breakdown of the writing process into three phases (of Generating and Recording Ideas; Composing Ideas; Expressing Ideas) in Chapters 1 and 2 (20 pages).  The authors do explain the psychological importance of keeping these processes separated and helpfully suggest a strategy of portioning your writing time (esp. against a deadline) into roughly equal thirds for these three processes.  These suggestions, however, can be adequately presented in a couple hundred words, e.g., as done in reviews, below.  <br />Chapter 3 offers 20 pages on \\"The Essay\\" (e.g., It is composed of an introduction, a body, and a conclusion).  The authors tell of the importance of developing a thesis and of making connections between points between evidence presented in the body. Indeed! <br />By the time I had read Chapter 3 it was becoming clear that some of the subtitle's intriguing promises (to aid the reader better to REFINE, EXPRESS, and GENERATE IDEAS) were going to be fulfilled at very rudimentary levels: perhaps as preparation for taking one's very FIRST course in composition. <br />As for the remainder of the subtitle (\\"Understanding the Processes of the Mind\\"), the authors may be forgiven if a mere two (trim) chapters dedicated to that ambitious undertaking (totaling 20 pages) offer very basic insights: <br />Chapter 4: \\"Making Sense: Reasoning for Discovery\\" - basic description of inductive and deductive reasoning; the need for probing one's analysis; considering the plausibility of evidence and assumptions.   <br />Chapter 5: \\"Writing Sense: Reasoning for Presentation\\" - covers univeral approaches to arguments (thesis vs. antithesis, etc.) and types of questions (factual, interpretive, evaluative).   <br />Then we round out the volume with: <br />Chapter 6: \\"Grammar\\" (40 pages). <br />If I were rating this volume as a primer on writing for high school students, I might give it 4 stars, as it IS written clearly (although certainly not grippingly) and covers some basics nicely.   <br />Billed as its title bills it (\\"Thinking on Paper: Refine, Express, and Actually Generate Ideas by Understanding the Processes of the Mind\\"), I can give it only 2 stars (the second being for clever marketing by the publisher). <br />If you have had a composition course or own a basic book on composition, you can learn what this book has to add by scanning the reviews here.	2005-02-22

I have studied only the portions relevant to non-fiction writing, but have been most pleased with the organic feel Williams provides for understanding why and how to make choices in the structuring of sentences and paragraphs. This volume goes so far beyond grammar rule books - although it also conveys most effectively the rules of English. <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the late chapters on matters such as \\"shape\\" and \\"elegance.\\"  I had not expected such poetic sensitivity from a linguist (forgive my chauvinism).  Williams reveals the principles behind why some structure- and word-choices enliven a message... and some cripple it.   <br /> <br />Williams takes a lot of the mystery out of writing - and a lot of the struggle.	2005-01-13

He identifies these sonnets as 1) \\"non-You\\" sonnets - not written as if *to* his subject; and 2) meditations on some subject other than the traditional (Love).  Sounds like a strange starting point, but Melchiori fills a couple hundred pages with intriguing (to the sonnet-obsessed) insights and implications for the tradition-breaking among the sonnets.<br /><br />Lots of thought-provoking insights not covered by other authors.	2004-12-11

To Make Heaven on Earth	Books	5	31	31	N	N	The fullest, most human audio glimpses of the yoga master	This is an exceptional CD, even by SRF standards. It presents an informal talk the great yoga master gave on Christmas Day 1949. Fully 74 minutes long, it is broken into 34 tracks so that you may fastforward directly to your favorite stories. <br /> There are too many inspirational peaks to list them all. Many are not printed or recorded elsewhere; others are presented with a new twist. Just to cite a few: <br /> * A most delightful telling of the master's youthful experience of overcoming hunger and learning to rely implicitly on the assistance of God (track 24). <br /> * An elsewhere-unrecorded, very touching story of the Divine Light appearing while he and some students drove through Laguna Beach: intervening to confirm his intuition in a tiny matter - of Scotch bread. (track 26) <br /> * An ecumenical narrative expressing the divine power, devotion, and humility of St. Francis. <br /> * A little sample of the master's lovely teasing with a student - here he teases Tara Mata (Laurie V. Pratt) (mingling it with praise for her), the highly advanced disciple who edited Autobiography of a Yogi and who has written so inspiringly of how the master initiated her into Cosmic Consciousness (see the SRF booklet, Forerunner of a New Race). <br /> <br />PS: I don't know why Amz has this checked as \\"abridged.\\" It has been re-engineered by SRF to reduced background noise, but it IS the full talk (periods of silent meditation omitted, of course).	2004-10-30

The book is published by Toronto's Anglican Book Centre, but includes a wide variety of Christian viewpoints, medical researchers' \\"recovering-agnostic\\" thoughts, and selections from Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist, and Native practitioners. The first chapters have nice overviews of scientific research documenting prayer's benefits (e.g., by Larry Dossey, MD). Later chapters present fascinating challenges and blessings in varied settings, using varied styles of prayer, and giving readers numerous models to consider for how to deepen their prayer lives and ministries.<br /><br />Each chapter gives background on the practitioner interviewed and then presents answers to questions related to their particular work and experience. Interesting issues are raised throughout, such as: the most effective forms of prayer, the possibility of *negative* effects, ethical issues in seeking permission, qualities a person can cultivate to be a more effective channel of prayer.<br /><br />I found myself wanting to hear a lot more from some of the practitioners than this brief volume allowed, but the book is uplifting and very helpful in suggesting people under whom you might pursue further study. The breadth of the experiences recounted offers a fertile ground for exploring common elements among all approaches to prayer, healing, and peace.	2004-09-18

Her twenty years of direct training under Paramahansa Yogananda have been supplemented by another fifty years of attunement with her Beloved Divine through her own samadhi meditation.  Although the material in this concise volume on intuition can be found elsewhere, it is invaluable to have Daya Ma's insights and experiences about intuition collected in one place, since intuition is the cornerstone of living the best life -- and of realizing The Best which lies behind that life.<BR>Daya Mata's insights into intuition go so much deeper than the common titles wherein someone with a few psychic gifts gives you &quot;secret awakening tips.&quot;  Here we have instead someone who has achieved *mastership*, who has lifted herself above the little ego, as one can feel from the humility with which she carries the mantle of her accomplishments.  I have heard nothing but astonished praise from those who have been privileged to have a personal audience with Daya Ma, and have myself been personally and specifically blessed by her compassion and intuitive sensitivity.<BR>My own experience, in brief: Some twenty years ago, unbeknownst to friends and family, I struggled through a most trying period of my life, finding myself  isolated from my usual sources of support. During that confounding December I was immeasurably uplifted to discover in my mailbox a personal Christmas card from Daya Mata, a woman with whom I had never corresponded, the incredibly busy president of an organization of 10s of thousands of members.  Never before had I receive a card from her; never since: just in my time of need.<BR>In these priceless pages Daya Ma explains the beautiful simplicity of how yoga practice naturally awakens intuitive guidance in your life -- how it develops from the stillness developed in meditation andfrom spiritual receptivity  developed by right attitude and practicing the presence.  The principles she presents are bolstered by examples from her own life and from the lives of fortunate souls she continues to touch.  They are a cornerstone both for spiritual growth and for effectiveness in everyday life.	2004-06-07

Fascinating thinking about many ways that the theater experience is different than that of the big or small screens.  <BR>As a result, Simon has penetrating insights for authors working in ANY medium - and for all students of human behavior and relationships.  To top it off, his personable, comfortable writing style makes the reader right at home -- like speaking with a companion (albeit a highly seasoned one) along for an entire theater evening.  <BR>In the course of the book, Simon helps the reader understand better why great theater grips (and moves and aggravates and CHANGES) us: drawing from Shakespeare, Chekov, Stoppard, Translations... and even back to Oedipus.  Just about anyone in any stage of theater experience will benefit from Simon's grasp of the dynamic part that is played in theater by YOU.  I'll be rereading this little volume numerous times to reflect on why and how these masterpieces work their wonders on me.	2004-02-08

Naomi uses the story of her life, traumas, struggles and triumphs to inspire hope and inform and transform lives.  Her astonishing recovery from Hepatitis-C (in the face of doctors who doomed her to certain death) is enough to make anyone stand up and pay attention.  Even more valuable is the walk through which Naomi takes us as we experience the ups and downs, the tests and (seeming) failures on this harsh road.  She frequently revisits the importance of her faith along this arduous journey, and shows us how that faith was not a neat bundle dropped easily in her lap but how she had to keep reaching out for it and for Divine Assistance, and for the help of friends who were instruments of that Assistance.  <br />Naomi's book offers a real (and realistic) boost for hope during anyone's darkest, most challenging hours.  She relates how she accepted and tapped into the Gifts she was given through the most diverse sources - medical, alternative-medical, family, friends... inner connection through prayer, meditation, yoga...  some things that might surprise some fans.  Wonderful quotes from sages and saints and singers throughout the ages sparkle in the pages, along with engaging introductions to the sources that came to her aid (ranging from Christ to doctors and psychologists and teachers).  She guides you to personal steps you can  pursue to bolster your own appreciation of what your mind/body/spirit can do together to express your own beautiful potential.  Her valuable list of resources is illuminated by her own personal experiences with them.<br />I was also impressed with the humor, humility, and balance Naomi uses in telling the story of her life-healing.  Most of us will never face the enormous challenges that she did, but our lives can nevertheless benefit by hearing about her lessons and triumphs -- and beginning to tap some of the same secrets and Power that she did.  Please bless yourself with this book -and enjoy some of the bountiful harvest that Naomi did!	2004-01-24

Be a Smile Millionaire (Collector's Series , No 4)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Smile with awareness of The Beloved, ever with you	This talk was recorded on January 23, 1950 (not at Yogananda's birthday as an earlier reviewer guesses) at the Hollywood Temple's &quot;Church of All Religions&quot; and reproduced by SRF as the 4th in a series of unique recordings where one may experience the vivid, energetic style of this great yoga master.  With his inimitable humor and stories, Yogananda offers many of his secrets for keeping one's balance and inner peace amidst the challenges of modern life.  As always, Yogananda's themes revolve around how to live a productive life in the world while keeping one's heart attuned to the love of The Creator.  He launches this talk by considering the New Testament study of Jesus &quot;breaking the Sabbath&quot; and explores the real (inner) meaning of keeping the Sabbath -- going deeply to the Kingdom Within and then maintaining that awareness and attunement throughout the day. He sympathizes that our training and habits make it a challenge to &quot;practice the presence&quot; so that one may be &quot;in the world but not of it&quot;.  <br />As an aid to all who would be seekers of Spirit and servants of humanity, Yogananda recommends combining Raja (meditative) Yoga and the active yoga of service (Karma Yoga) -- the same simple and loving spiritual solution Jesus offered when he explained his healing work on the Sabbath.  <br />As he did in Autobiography of a Yogi and throughout his teachings, Yogananda demonstrates the commonality of the core teachings of all religions (drawing most heavily on the teachings of Christ and Krishna).  Most helpfully, he offers strategies for bringing all these universal teachings to bear on the intense challenges that modern life presents.  <br />As of 2003, SRF has released six recordings in this series, and it is rewarding to hear the great yoga master's voice express clearly and directly (the old wire/cylinder recording have been electronically cleaned of most static, etc.).  The other recordings were made at special events (such as special Christmas or Easter services); this recording offers us an example of an &quot;average&quot; Sunday service of the type with which Yogananda inspired students at SRF centers during the 1940s and early 50s.  It's a powerful way to take yourself into the experience of that presence and his message: far above &quot;average.&quot;	2004-01-18
US	52273646	RQTZ11HXPHDXE	0130092789	397502033	Core CSS (2nd Edition)	Books	3	16	17	N	N	Adequate reference volume - probably not a starting point	Just a few notes about the SECOND edition (of which the publisher was kind enough to send me a review copy): Judging from descriptions by reviewers of the first edition, this seems to be a considerably enhanced second edition, addressing complaints described here.<br />The book is easy to look through and use as a reference.  The preface describes the target audiences as already &quot;web authors&quot; who want to become more effective.  If you are completely new to CSS, the book does a nice step-by-step education of the ins and outs of CSS.  However, if it had been my first CSS book (instead of 6th), I'm not sure that I would have had the motivation to learn how to convert all my planning from simple HTML markup to CSS; that I got most persuasively from Owen Briggs' &quot;Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation&quot; ISBN 1904151043, which I highly recommend to anyone still just mixing CSS into their HTML for occasional convenience.  Nor is the writing engaging enough to carry along a reader who is not already convinced that they have GOT to learn CSS.<br />&quot;Core CSS&quot; does provide pretty comprehensive reference material, although some of it will not become &quot;pragmatic&quot;(the stated objective) for a few years -- e.g., all the material on CSS-3. The author usually includes the caveat &quot;proposed&quot; before the term CSS-3 ( the standards are still developing).  Three years from now when browsers start to attend to CSS-3 standards, this material will apply (or be outdated if final standards different).  Anyway, for CSS newcomers the inclusion of all the not-yet-applicable CSS-3 material will probably be more confusing and distracting than useful.  More &quot;pragmatic&quot; to me would have been the inclusion in the extensive browser-compatibility tables of Apple's Safari browser (i.e., Mac OS X).  Safari's user base is closing in on 10 million; it is the fastest and arguably most convenient browser yet designed; and althoughMac users are a minority, their ranks include above-average incomes (and hence web shopping, etc.) and a preponderance of designers (including web).<br />My other concern about attempting to present &quot;Core CSS&quot; as an all-in-one CSS is that it does NOT have  examples of how to WORK AROUND the documented quirks introduced by the pervasive disregard by browser designers for CSS standards.  Here is where ANY CSS designer needs to study  a copy of Eric Meyer's &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design.&quot;  The latter volume enables a designer to see how/why to employ CSS from scratch in designing pages/sites and special strategies for REdesigning to maximize efficiency for author and visitors. <br />I'm not one to encourage monopolies, yet I must say to the beginner that once Meyer's volume has given you the strategies to design with CSS,  Meyer's reference volume (0072131780 - Cascading Style Sheets 2.0: Programmer's Reference) continues to be handier to work with as a daily-basis reference than &quot;Core CSS&quot; - even including basic conceptual frameworks such as the &quot;box model&quot; in a way that helps your planning (despite being two years older).  Although &quot;Core CSS&quot; includes some screen shots, they do not offer as strong a conceptual underpinning for beginning one's work with CSS.  My apologies to the publisher for a tepid review of Core CSS: it is improved over the first edition; but it doesn't amount to either an effective introduction for beginners or a comprehensive 2004 reference for the experienced.	2004-01-11

I wanted a different take this time around, especially for hints about undocumented features in Panther - because although I routinely peruse the MacNN forums, there are SO many new shortcuts and features to keep track of I wanted it in a book.<br />David has not disappointed -  within minutes I found several tips on Mail and Safari that were well worth the modest Amaz price.  I've been using Macs for nearly twenty years, so there's obviously a lot here that's not new to me - but there's a lot that is!  The &quot;Missing Manual&quot; had doubled the value of my having upgraded to Panther (OS 10.3).  It has made it easy for me to start taking advantage of system features that I never took the time to figure out.<br />The section on the Terminal and Unix command line is brief, but still a very helpful intro to the complete newbie for understanding whether/why one would want to learn more about those power-tools within your Mac.  If you really want to get deeply into that, you'll probably want to go with something like O'Reilly's &quot;Learning Unix for Mac OS X&quot; (ISBN 0596003420 ) after reading David's intro.<br />As with David's &quot;iMovie Missing Manual&quot; the writing is very comfortable - clear and pleasant, lightened with occasional humor (but without the obsessive lame jokey-ness of some computer guides &quot;for dummies&quot;).  This does not FEEL like reading a manual... but is incredibly helpful as one!	2004-01-09

This title is perhaps somewhat overlooked today because of the immense popularity of the greater length of the more recent &quot;Where There Is Light&quot; - a wonderful collection of inspirationals from the yoga master.  &quot;Sayings&quot; does, however, provide a collection of complex and thought-provoking insights that often go still deeper than many in &quot;WTIL&quot;. Many quotations in &quot;Sayings&quot; take the form of questions (today we might say FAQs) from students on puzzling aspects of life and yoga's instructions for life.  <br />Just to give you a feel, consider the student who protested that he couldn't be expected to succeed in using yoga to reach heights of physical and spiritual success the way Yogananda had because after all, &quot;...Sir, you are a master!&quot;  Yogananda replied, &quot;All souls are equal. The only difference between you and me is that I made the effort...&quot;<br />Some of my favorite quotations show Yogananda's ever-present humility and desire to turn students' attention away from him and toward the Creator, as when a student asked, &quot;...Dr. Lewis was your first disciple in this country, wasn't he?&quot;  Yogananda left the questioner a little aback when he responded, &quot;That's what they say.&quot;  He then added that he never called students his disciples: &quot;God is the Guru; they are His disciples.&quot;  <br />If you found yourself moved by Yogananda's &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; or have studied his meditation Lessons (still available from Self-Realization Fellowship), you will really appreciate these Sayings.  Sometimes A m a z o n seems only to have used copies of this title available, but you can get new copies of both cloth and paperback editions from the educational organization Yogananda founded at yogananda-srf dot org.	2004-01-03

This volume however makes Goldberg's perceptive analysis and effective writing available in paperback (earlier title is out of print).  <br />Goldberg's work is not quite as casual in style as Renee Baron's delightful works (&quot;Enneagram Made Easy&quot; and &quot;Am I Your Type&quot;), but it will appeal much more to the no-nonsense business world.  His examples of people at different points on the Enneagram are drawn from his business experience and effectively highlight the types of challenges and opportunities that work presents differently to individuals, depending on their Enneagram dynamics.  <br />I cannot imagine anyone not being fascinated and empowered by looking at themselves, their coworkers, and their family through Goldberg's careful presentation.  He is respectful of all and does not approach Enneagram as a &quot;pigeon-holing&quot; or &quot;typing&quot; process.  Rather it's an appreciation of strengths and challenges.  From a background in psychology, I especially appreciate his discussion of the underlying dynamics and likely sources of how family experience helps us slide into certain Enneagram-number ways of operating.<br />So much more readable and better-organized that most of the &quot;classics&quot; in Enneagram.  If you enjoy processing and sharing insights about how humans function, you may also want to explore Baron's titles. The latter are excellent for a casual chat around the family room - then those who like to really APPLY the principles to their work and life will want to move into Goldberg.	2003-12-31

Over time it became clearer and clearer that the most powerful healing effects had little to do with expensive biomedical biofeedback equipment and everything to do with basic mind-body-breathing techniques that have been known to thousands of years to advanced yoga practitioners.<br />Yogananda's little volume is an extremely powerful tool for beginning your self-healing. He guides you to the various approaches that might work best for you depending on your personal temperament.<br />Reading the book is extraordinarily inspiring, but it takes *practicing* the methods to experience the healing. They are skills - and they become powerful with practice. If you add regular meditation to your life routine you will also find that your inner INTUITION develops and that you can sensitively customize the suggested affirmative and healing practices to your own circumstances. My own survival of life-threatening illness is testimony beyond what I have seen in my clients.<br />You have power within you that is hard to conceive. If this little introduction fails to persuade you, read Yogananda's Autobiography (ISBN 0876120796 ).	2003-11-24

The editors at Self-Realization Fellowship have again produced a beautifully inspiring and motivating volume, drawing on some of the great yoga master's inimitable expressions of eternal truth.  Drawing partly from talks published elsewhere (e.g., Man's Eternal Quest and The Divine Romance), this volume also includes life-empowering quotes that would otherwise have to be culled from the years of Yogananda's Self-Realization Lessons - plus a couple of other essays not elsewhere in print. In the latter category is a brilliant piece on faith, fearlessness, and the uprooting of unconscious fears.  <BR>In times of tremendous uncertainty and world-upheaval the reassurance offered by such pieces as &quot;Ridding the Consciousness of Worry&quot; and &quot;Removing the Static of Fear&quot; are real treasures.  It is exquisitely comforting to read how Yogananda himself handled threats of economic disaster in &quot;Finding Inner Assurance that  God Is With You&quot; - one more demonstration that he does not speak from abstract theory but from principles that he has tested and proven in his own life. He never tells you that it will be easy - only that the power of attunement with your soul will lead you to VICTORY over the most difficult challenges. His life and those of his advanced students are testimony to that truth.<BR>Seldom has a tiny volume combined so effectively the most advanced concepts of psychology with the most divine insights into the power of faith. This is destined to become another classic of PRACTICAL SPIRITUALITY - perhaps rivaled only by his AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI (ISBN 0876120834 ) and THE LAW OF SUCCESS (ISBN  0876121504  )	2003-11-19

Dr. Nutt's &quot;Introduction&quot; is an enjoyable, stimulating contribution to the latter category, although it is not intended to be a stand-alone introduction for a first-time viewer/reader of these plays.<br />Taking these plays as a group is a very effective way to appreciate the artistic, humanistic, and spiritual directions that Shakespeare took in the last third of his playwriting career.  The plays are comedies only in the sense of superficial distinction of &quot;tragedies end in death; comedies end in marriage.&quot; In a Shakespeare Romance we are treated to stories noble characters struggling with tragic flaws, often in medieval settings with mythological processes of grace and redemption helping them through heart-wrenching failure and loss, along a path of determined courage in the face of life-threatening challenges or paralyzing emotional pain, and finally to a point of reunion and reclamation. Only in providing at least one marriage at the close of the play are these comedies; the humor is usually provided by clowns and rogues as in the sub-plots of the Tragedies.<br />The  fanciful as well as tragi-comic story lines are often alien to modern readers, and Dr. Nutt's introduction helps us appreciate the grandeur of their artistic achievement and the perspective they offer for a modernity that still reels with emotional disasters that mingle family disruption, intrigue, and international politics.<br />Dr. Nutt's insightful comparative presentation also gives the lie to two misperceiving rejections of Shakespeare: 1) that his works are amoral [usually referring to his great tragedies], and 2) that his &quot;Late Works&quot;'s were of lower quality and probably reflected 'his fatigue with playwriting.'  These are extreme dramas where triumphant joys are achieved only after enormous tragedy, with &quot;people enduring shocking extremes of suffering, wrong and ill fortune yet responding with courage, patience, fidelity, determination and constancy.&quot; As Dr. Nutt says, one of the most distinguishing features in these creations is that they &quot;appear determined to exhibit humanity at it most admirable.&quot;<br />If you appreciate Shakespeare, drama, or questions of human struggle, the little volume is to be enjoyed and pleasurably digested.  One final easy shot is due the publisher: yes, you have produced a fine work in an appropriately high-quality paperback edition; your list price, however, will assure poor sales in both the general and student populations. What a shame. Fortunately, this online service offers used sales to the reader's rescue. I'd strongly encourage intermediate-level Shakespeare students to score a copy.	2003-09-29

Hundreds of thousands of readers who were deeply moved by Yogananda's &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;  have been eagerly awaiting the release by Self-Realization Fellowship of his commentary on the words of Christ.  The great master entrusted the editing and publication of his final writings to his closest and most advanced disciples, such as Sri Daya Mata and Mrinalini Mata, who are still living. Like their master, these wholely dedicated monastics adhere to the highest standards in preparing accurate, faithful, gorgeous editions of his great works. Examples in recent years would be the award winning &quot;Wine of the Mystic&quot; (ISBN 087612225X ) and &quot;God Talks with Arjuna&quot;(2-vol Gita)(ISBN  0876120311 ).  Similar energy, loyalty and care is currently being invested in the preparation of the master's New Testament commentaries, a *portion* or which are included in the present little volume.<br />Unfortunately the zeal, impatience and over-confidence of some of Yogananda's former students lead them to pull together a hasty compilation without the permission of SRF, holder of copyright on all of Yogananda's writings.  For years I had to *wonder* what this volume was because I couldn't countenance supporting r o g u e  around-the-end efforts by purchasing.  However, now having had a chance to peruse a loaner copy, I would like to assure other SRF students that THEY AREN'T MISSING MUCH.  If you have studied the full 3-1/2 years of the &quot;SRF Lessons&quot; and subscribed to the weekly &quot;Service Readings&quot;, you'll find that the most vital parts of this little paperback are already printed in those Service Readings.  <br />[And if you are new to all this and *haven't* yet studied the Lessons, you'll probably benefit much more by reading Autobiography of a Yogi (ISBN  0876120834 ) and applying yourself to the study of the  meditation techniques available directly from the the weekly Lessons out of the Los Angeles headquarters. If you have any questions, please feel free to e mail me.]<br />There is so much more to Yogananda's commentary on the words of Christ than is surveyed here.  We are all looking forward to the Self-Realization Fellowship release of the full commentary. I have no doubt that it will be worth the wait!	2003-09-27

The same respectfulness and confident humility that graces her Shakespeare criticism flourishes here - and warrants at least a brief expression of consensus with earlier laudatory reviews.  <br />Most significantly for the lover of Keats, Vendler integrates the life and creativity of the seven or so months during which he produced odes that &quot;belong to that group of works in whch the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.&quot;  She makes explicit the implicit signs of connection among and growth through the Odes (and a key portion of Fall of Hyperion).  Connections with Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton are interwoven skillfully -- as integral parts of Keats' context as were the works of nature and art that are explicitly addressed in the poems.<br />Vendler's work extends much deeper than I can fully follow, and some of it will leave all but English majors in the dust.  Let's not let that discourage the rest of us amateur Keats enjoyers - the Introduction alone plus the initial discussion of each of the Odes contain indispensable caresses for the heart of mere mortals.	2003-09-14

Sure - all the information is available elsewhere, but the authors have helpfully collected all this information in a very clear, thorough and beginner-friendly manner.  It's getting difficult to find a new copy of this Wrox title, but it's sure worth snatching up one of the great buys on a used copy.	2003-09-14

If you're the type of learner who benefits from *doing* and *playing around with possibilities*, I think you'll find Meloni's approach workable.  I hadn't done any programming for decades (and that obviously was neither MySQL nor web-based), and was used to FoxBase and Filemaker style databases, but this book was the easiest of all those PHP/MySQL books I looked into -- so that I was able to get set up and connect with my ISP's MySQL db and begin playing around with web pages through PHP.<br />Sometimes the examples are worked through with painfully repetitive details, but this enabled me to get more comfortable with the PHP approach to sending commands and getting information from a MySQL database. The examples (code helpfully available for online download) left with models whose operation I understood and could modify into boilerplate for experimenting with my own projects. And for me it really worked to be able to get into the throws of development BEFORE I had to learn vast amounts of PHP that was not yet relevant to me. <br />The book begins with a section of installation and configuration of PHP, MySQL, and Apache (which was unneeded since I used my ISP's setup.  Then three brief chapters nicely outline just the basics of PHP you'll need for using its language. In a third section she shows the use of PHP for querying for types of browsers and operating systems, sending email, and working with files through a browser. Finally, the fourth section walks you through basic MySQL database processes such as creating the db and its tables, listing information about them, and displaying selections of their data -- all done through PHP/HTML in browser pages (e.g., for a 'My Music Collection' db) in ways that you'll want to use when you develop your own sites. - Very helpful!<br />The fifth section has chapters to help you regulate visitors to your site -- setting up ids &amp; passwords, storing them in the database and in cookies.The sixth section puts all this togetherin a full &quot;Contact Management System&quot; - still walking you slowly through the process.<br />There is not a lot of detailed explanation about exactly why one must use the exact PHP or MySQL commands (from among alternate strategies), but I'm content now to start learning that from intermediate level books.  What Meloni offered me that other &quot;introductions&quot; did not was a quick way to get in and actually toy around with my own actual MySQL dbs through PHP/HTML pages that I created and got online.  As a beginning experience - it sure worked for me!	2003-09-13

The words &quot;God Alone&quot; were the personal, private motto of the intellectual giant and Himalayan spirit who was given the monastic title Sri Gyanamata. In the subtitle, The Life and Letters of a Saint, we find Yogananda's own perspective on &quot;Sister&quot;, as she was commonly known around the hermitage. The sixteen pages of Yogananda's own personal tribute here to his &quot;foremost woman disciple&quot; are telling -- unparalleled in his treatment of any of his other students.<br />Although her life was thorned with severe physical trials, Yogananda affirmed that &quot;Never did I see inher face, in her eyes, anger or anguish or pain; only the sweetness of God.&quot;  The master especially appreciated the humility which crowned her greatness. She never herself wrote a book.  It remained for admiring devotees to collect letters and notes that were left after her passing in 1951. These very private notes (advice to devotees in need, devotional outpourings to Spirit or to Paramahansaji, notes of appreciation to her from Yogananda, diary entries).  <br />The candor, simplicity, and compassion of her advice have been priceless solace and inspiration to me during trials of body, mind, or spirit. I have often said to students that if I were sentenced to abandonment on a desert isle for the rest of my years that Richard Bucke's &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot; is one of the five books I would select if possible.  &quot;God Alone&quot; is another of those top five.  I regret only that the sales ranking on the present site suggests that thousands of potential beneficiaries have yet to discover gem and its blessings.<br />CONTENTS include:  Highlights of Gyanamata's life.  Yogananda's account of her passing in the highest spiritual state. Her united love for spiritual truth from sources in both Christianity and yoga.  The spiritual power achieved simply by cultivating 'right attitude.'  Inspiring thoughts on the guru-disciple relationship by one who *could* have been a guru herself.  Sophisticated understanding of renunciation as an *inner* process. A saint's insights on service, loyalty, and receptivity. Reaping blessings from times of great suffering. Spiritual healings and experiences. And unparalled insights on devotion -- from a mother of wisdom (the meaning of her monastic title, Gyanamata). <br />In no other volume (outside his &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;) will you find such a collection of transformative jewels from Yogananda's teachings as in these spell-binding pages. All who appreciate &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; owe it to their souls to visit these &quot;spiritual footprints for all to follow.&quot;	2003-09-10

The nature photography in these annual appointment/desk calendars continues to win awards.  From majestic mountain, sky, and ocean views, to minute details of gems and blossoms, to touching mother-cub candids... the range of photography over the weeks of the year is gorgeously varied.<br />If you have never treated your eyes to the pictures or your soul to the inspirational quotes, you definitely owe it to yourself to get this year's (2004 calendar year) edition. I'd be surprised if you didn't decide to order gift copies for spiritual Christmastime presents.  The visual beauty the spiritual universality make it a highly appropriate gift for loved ones of ANY spiritual orientation.<br />Finally, more good news about the 2004 calendar: the week-at-a-time calendar pages (that alternate with the photographic sheets - and which have space for noting appointments, etc.) are on a less slick paper this year -- an improvement over recent years where glossy pages made it almost impossible to write in ink without smearing. Now there's no reason not to replace an ordinary desk weekly calendar with this splendor!	2003-09-10

Judging from the reviews (below) it has a lot of appeal for professional designers. <BR>Keep in mind that it is NOT primarily a technology how-to book. And yet there ARE some helpful clues to get a designer-new-to-web thinking about issues of how to implement pleasing, effective web sites:  what is &quot;Flash&quot;? a &quot;blog&quot;? CSS? (cascading style sheets) ...there are &quot;browser compatibility&quot; issues? <BR>But once you've been alerted to some of these technology quandries you'll quickly need to turn to further education elsewhere.  Fortunately, Benun has a nice selection of sites, forums, and publications listed at the back for your reference.<BR>If you are already well-versed in the technologies of the web, you may find that you can learn most of what Benun offers through a cursory scanning at the library.  Certainly the sites (25 of them) discussed here are NOT analyzed &quot;in depth&quot; -- the book is only 144pp after all.  Offering a new way to think about the TYPE of audience(s) for which a site is designed is a nice contribution on Benun's part (see elaboration in others' reviews). <BR>If you are just beginning your design enterprise you may be upset to have laid out this much money for just a few starting ideas.  For economy's sake you may want to browse a wide selection (and it is wide) at a library or book shop.	2003-09-09

Then you have probably not read Yogananda's &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; ( ISBN 0876120834 ), because he describes there his life-long (and successful) search for communion (and union) with The Infinite.  During his search, Yogananda made insightful study of the great world scriptures, especially those of India and Judeo-Christianity; more importantly, he studied for ten years directly under one of the most revered yoga masters of India.  From Yogananda's search, from his own relentless prayer and meditation, and from his personal experience teaching other seekers he concluded that there is no approach to God has the spiritual potency of this prescribed combination: yoga-deepened meditation plus devotional practice.  This handsome little introduction to the highlights of Yogananda's teaching culls from his numerous published works scores of  explosive insights for dynamiting difficulties along your spiritual climb. Unlike authors that parrot wisdom they have heard from others, Yogananda speaks from the authority of one who has experienced the view from the mountain top - and the glimpses he gives you of the view will take your breath away. The yoga master's guidance  is divided into six sections:<br />I. Real prayer is a demand of the soul; and the soul has only one need: re-union with its Creator. Wants and wishes are endless... and unreliable.  Attuning to and encouraging the need of the soul to realize its immortality, its divinity empowers your prayer.  Yogananda urges the reader to cultivate prayer from that depth and explains the vastness of the power you tap thereby.<br />II. Concentrate the mind's force through yoga. In Shakespeare's HAMLET, even the fratricidal Claudius can see the meaningless of seeming to pray by merely mouthing words -- without the mind and feeling really focusing there [ &quot;My words fly up; my thoughts remain below. Words without thoughts never to Heaven go.&quot; ] <br />III.  Know what to pray for.  While conceding that you are free to ask for anything from your loving Creator, Yogananda argues persuasively for enabling the Omniscient One to help you pray wisely.<br />IV. Have a clear conception of God: a conception that you can love, that you can trust, that you can feel intimate with; a God whose essence is love and who is readier to help you than you are to ask.<br />V. Praying with dynamic will power.  Yogananda was a teacher of irrepressible determination to adhere to the highest principles and accomplish the greatest service to humanity. As an Eastern teacher in the conservatively Christian America of the 20's and 30's, the obstacles to his mission were Himalayan. His advice on developing super-human *dynamic* will is based on the principles that he used to establish against all odds a world-wide community of spiritual education that continues vibrantly fifty years after his passing.<BR> <br />VI. Reclaiming your inner sanctuary.  The last pages contain some of Yogananda's most beautiful guidance on how to cultivate and sustain your inner peace, your connectedness with omnipresent Spirit -- the state from which prayer becomes natural, intimate, and essentially one with the divine response.<br />Besides making a superb gift for a friend who may be struggling spiritually, the gems in this collection are excellent to keep at the desk or bedside of a seasoned spiritual aspirant: ideal for random opening to see what encouragement Spirit has for any moment.	2003-08-10

NOTE, however, that this volume presents exclusively what is usually lumped as &quot;The narrative poems&quot; - i.e., it does NOT include the full set of sonnets ( which appear in a separately edited volume of the NCS series).  As a value to the student/customer, therefore is this tradeoff: NCS covers here a smaller portion of the Shakespeare canon than the alternative from Oxford (ed. by Colin Burron, 2002, ISBN 019281933X ), but NCS can therefore offer larger typeface; larger and better quality paper.  <br />In this NCS edition, editor Roe provides helpful background material on each of the poems [Venus, Lucrece, Phoenix &amp; Turtle, Lover's Complaint, and Passionate Pilgrim (*partially* attributable to Shakspeare) ]. The length and depth of discussion of each poem's introduction is not as great as one usually finds for an edition of, say, The Sonnets; but these poems have not stirred so much controversy or confusion either among the reading public or in academic analysis. The poems are (at least on the surface) much more readable and &quot;accessible&quot; to the general reader than are the sonnets. Roe's thorough annotations on each page of text clarify unusual or ambiguous words; they also raise intriguing issues about Shakespeare's art and agenda in suggestive writing with multiple levels of meaning.<br />Both this NCS edition by Roe and the Burrow Oxford edition were released too early to benefit from fascinating new insights into the ever-puzzling bantam of this flock: The Phoenix and the Turtle. For the compelling evidence that this long-locked enigma of the canon is an eulogy to two Elizabethan Catholic martyrs, the reader will need to turn to a Times Literary Supplement issue from April of this year.  <br />For most of the controversies surrounding these poems, I'll risk claiming that there have been few critical revelations between the publication of this excellent 1993NCS edition and now; so (excepting the 2003 TLS article mentioned above) it remains satisfyingly current. For reading pleasure and thoughtful study of these masterpieces, I think you'll be  most pleased to own this Cambridge edtion.	2003-06-24

The thousands of cases analyzed to date offer scientists a lot of evidence to weigh, present theologians with challenges to long-established scriptural interpretations, and give any inquisitive mind a pause to re-ask fundamental questions about human consciousness and spirituality.<br />Mark Fox has done a fine job of pulling together the most current studies and the persisting issues surrounding the NDE phenomenon.  He is level-headed and fair and writes with a pleasant, reader-respecting style (unlike some other strident volumes which are bent on sharpening some particular ideological or social axe).<br />The fundamental crux in resolving what to do with the NDE phenomenon seems to be:  Why does a moment when PHYSICAL functioning is at its worst provide (more often than not) a CONSCIOUSNESS that is functioning peacefully, joyfully, and even with greater accuracy and more information than ordinarily?<br />If you read Fox's documentation of this phenomenon, I think you'll find the search for satisfactory answers to this mystery well worth your consideration.	2003-06-23

The subtle, gentle blues and golds of the typefaces are perfectly suited to the Peace-centered inspirationals of Yogananda that grace each page. It is not a large book - and so is unsuited for the stream-of-consciousness or endless detail of events with which some people fill journals.  <BR>But if you take advantage of the soul-centering advice of Yogananda and take the time to select your own gems of insight for your journaling, you could scarce find a more pleasing abode to house them.

But author Mumaw is taking you back to the *process* with which the sites? designers had to match design and structure to content and mission.  <br />Note that this is NOT a book about *how to* make a design function (i.e., no HTML, DHTML, Flash, etc.), but on how to conceptionalize *what* functions / designs one needs:  taking a complex business or organizational message or process and putting an attractive and effective face on it.

Such a pleasure to read, poet Corn?s guide to understanding the ?beat? of poetry never leaves the reader in ?manual? tedium. Instead he entertains with the lively varieties that ?feet? can dance in different poetic styles.<BR>Realizing the poets and poetry lovers generally appreciate both words and history, Corn introduces terms through intriguing tidbits about their etymology and resulting connotations (e.g., verse from turning - like plowed rows; line from linen thread; text from textile; iamb from Greek to assail). Likewise, he shows the power of different metrical patterns in daily speech and variations thereof - thus helping the strange pedilections of poets make a little more sense. <BR>The focus is *English* language verse, but Corn also includes enough cross-cultural references to help us appreciate our differences and commonalities with the ancients and other moderns. Yes, it is a manual in the sense of providing a thorough understanding of how and why poetry meters (and sometimes doesn?t); but Corn is a poet and here enhances a student?s love of verse through deeper understanding, even for the technical underpinnings.  <BR>A HIGHLY recommended and DELIGHTFUL book.	2003-06-21

In fact, so will most lay reader lambs who innocently venture into what they thought were safe fields of, say, the Times Literary Supplement in hopes of deepening their appreciation of the classics and literary creativity. So many &quot;academic&quot; surveys cloak in academic wool their lupine ideological teeth, Tyson keeps a strong, healthy overview of the various schools (packs?) of critics. She appreciates the concerns and contributions of the various critical approaches without being co-opted; she shares their thoughtful contributions in &quot;user-friendly&quot; fashion without resorting to the cutesy &quot;for dummie sheep&quot; approach. <br />An excellent guide through the tangled weavings of modern critical writings, analyzing with respect, exploring with optimistic skepticism.  GENERAL READERS: Don't leave this &quot;textbook&quot; in the classroom; it is a most comfortable armour for venturing forth into the 21st Century literary world. If you were not fortunate enough to be one of Tyson's students, study with her here!	2003-06-16

This is a gorgeous, full-color, masterfully laid-out piece of work by an author with cutting-edge understanding of Cascading Style Sheets and willingness to share his fine creative judgement.  Yet it may take you a while to convince yourself (as it did me myself) that you need one more Eric Meyer CSS title.  The glowing reviews finally broke through my resistance, and my facility with CSS has had several breakthroughs as a result.<br />Like many of you, I already have Eric's two premier titles for guiding web transitions from the difficult world of patched-together HTML solutions to the powerful, systematic, maintenance-friendly potentials of CSS. Here's my experience so you can see if it matches yours. <br />Through insightful and persuasive volumes such as Owen Briggs 'C S S: Separating Content from Presentation' (see reviews at ISBN 1904151043) I finally got that *aha* experience about CSS:  These new standards are more than just style sheets, design aids, and download-enhancers; more even than the sum of these: once HTML 4 standards are better followed by browsers, CSS will open up all web-design work in remarkable ways.  *HOWEVER*: design life in the meanwhile is extremely frustrating while browsers take their sweet time repairing past imbedded sins. As much as I wanted to break free from old HTML ways, the inconsistencies and vagaries of how browsers render CSS so discouraged me from solving design issues with CSS, that I considered taking a two year sabbatical from design until technology caught up.  I thought I was just 'losing it' until I found Eric's own statement right on my desk in 'C S S: The Definitive Guide':  &quot;You may notice that, unlike other chapters, almost none of the figures in (the chapter on Positioning objects) was generated with a web browser. This is... a statement about the reliability and consistency of positioning implementations...&quot;  <br />What's the average designer to do when even Jeffrey Zeldman admits (in his preface here)that his fallback position in the current world of CSS is *emailing Eric Meyer*?  In this volume we see. Eric walks you through common types of design and redesign issues are solvable through CSS (and provides frequent color screen shots displaying exactly what happens after small changes in code). It is refreshing that so much care is taken with both the design and writing of this book. Even the *hints* in margins surprise me - after I thought I had read practically every CSS hint published to date. Eric puts them together in an engaging manner.<br />No matter how skilled you are with design or with HTML, unless your mastery of CSS specifically is on a par with Eric's (all 3 or 4 of you such people), I think that after reading twenty pages of &quot;Eric on CSS&quot; you are likely to feel you wasted valuable time each week since this book's release!  Thanks, Eric. Thanks, New Riders for the time and expense to make such a quality volume. Fine work on the companion web site and downloadable code as well!	2003-06-15

I agree with other readers that it will probably make fascinating reading for people of varying experience with Shakespeare.  <br />Even if you've looked at Shakespeare from all sides now - the opportunity to ponder curious ways the plays differ in favoring certain words ('good' or 'eyes', for example) or in use of verse-versus-prose, <br />Keeping in mind Hamlet's words (a prophecy about Shakespearean studies perhaps?), &quot;believe none of us!&quot; - don't bet the farm (or the semester grade) on &quot;facts&quot; from these lists. A couple cases:<br />**A list of the roles in which Shakespeare himself acted is necessarily ninety percent speculation, since we have decent evidence on only a couple of *possible* Shakespeare roles - and those suggested many years or decades after the purported acting.<br />**Misleading judgements that counter overwhelming consensus occasionally strike the reader familiar with the plays:  a) putting &quot;Titania and Bottom&quot; at the top of a list of &quot;Passionate Lovers&quot; (Titania and Oberon are the item, and the Titania-Bottom exchange is played as a spell-induced infatuation);  b) listing &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; as first among actors of his plays *is* a direct use of the 'authoritative' First Folio; no one, however, considers it likely that Will ranked anywhere near Richard Burbage in skill or popularity (the Folio is acknowledged to be bolstered  with marketing-friendly &quot;editorial fictions&quot;).<br />Have fun with the book - let it stimulate your imagination. Yet decline to be lulled into thinking these lists are research tools, or factual, or secure foundations for comprehending the plays or their author.	2003-06-13

Under twenty dollars for a well thought-out, expertly assembled dictionary of over a thousand pages makes this Penguin an excellent purchase.  As for the content, I will simply &quot;second&quot; the observations of earlier reviewers - and recommend that you look through their notes below to be sure this is what you want. This review is just to offer...<br />One CAVEAT:  This inch-and-three-quarters paperback is extremely valuable and deserves to get well thumbed-over by any student of English literature or criticism in general.  One could only wish that the publisher had released it in a &quot;quality paperback&quot; format that would better survive such thumbing. The present release  (a 2000 paperback reissue of the 1998 hardback) is closer in quality to a mass market paperback, with newsprint grade paper, etc.  Annotators and highlighters will find their inks bleeding severely through the pages.<br />Unfortunately, few of us will have the C-note to lay out for the (presumably much better produced) hardback edition... which would be a *real* treat to keep at one's writing table.  Until you win the lottery(or Penguin releases a quality paperback), grab the affordable paperback: it's rewarding enough to keep you *wanting* to highlight, although disappointing when you do.	2003-06-12

It is a handy reference, especially to the newcomer to this period, to obtain *a little* more depth of knowledge into lives one may hear referenced while reading, say, Shakespeare studies. The best-targeted audience is the general lay public or undergraduates. English majors will soon become disappointed how the sketches selectively scratch the surface:  the authors (editors, nearly) collect information from secondary/ tertiary sources, and sometimes round out entries with such information as who married whom how soon after their spouse?s death (i.e., occasionally higher on intrigue than substance).  A dictionary of 700 entries obviously cannot explore the controversies of a life, but the Palmers at least strive to alert us to prominent issues therein.<br />Admirably, the secondary sources on which they draw are responsibly acknowledged at the end of each entry and favor highly appropriate selections such as E. K. Chambers, Eccles, Schoenbaum, McKerrow, and the Dictionary of National Biography.  Some changes are said to have been made since the original (1981) edition, but for a book only striving for such global summaries of each life can probably safely be bought in the earlier edition if you wish to save by selecting a used copy.	2003-06-12

In this award-winning volume, Twentieth Century Indo-American sage Paramahansa Yogananda applies his irrepressible spiritual pursuit to Omar Khayyam's Twelfth Century masterpiece. Like most cultures through the ages, Kayyam's Persia was much friendlier to his mainstream career (in mathematics and astronomy) than to his spiritual revelations. The wondrous poetic beauties which sparkle through his Rubaiyat express his personal, non-canonical insights into Enlightenment (aka: the Kingdom of Heaven, Nirvana, Samadhi) are in metaphors - symbolisms whose spiritual implications register only for those &quot;who have eyes to see&quot; - who have themselves had a glimpse of higher spiritual realms.<br />The publisher of Wine of the Mystic has included an eye-opening foreword to this volume that puts these complexities into perspective, including 1) the fact that Edward FitzGerald (translator for the most famous English-language editions) only grudging acknowledged the mystical significance of the work, 2) FitzGerald's poetic techniques that faithfully capture the *spirit* of stanzas even when they are not linear translations, 3) the tradition among Sufi mystical poets of using wine as a symbol for Divine Intoxication.<br />Why should a poem that is merely (on the surface) a hymn to the joys of drunkenness survive for a millenium and continue to fascinate cultures around the world in languages so unlike its author's?  In his introductory words, Yogananda summarizes the miracle of FitzGerald's (apparently materialist) translation by called him &quot;divinely inspired to catch exactly in gloriously musical English words the soul of Omar's writings.&quot;  To those who have received a hint of the Divine Intoxication, a deep intuitive chord may be struck by Yogananda's explanation: &quot;Profound spiritual treatises by some mysterious divine law do not disappear from the earth even after centuries of misunderstanding, as in the case of the Rubaiyat.&quot;<br />As to the book itself (Wine of the Mystic)? The awards it has won, the beauty of its color illustrations, tastefully selected type faces, and rich reproduction make this volume irresistable immediately upon opening its pages.

At only 250 pages, however, the treatment of complex terms, schools, and issues must often be cursory. This second edition, is however, nicely updated from the 1990 first edition, and presents a more readable typeface on better paper.  Being relatively small, it may be the most convenient literary dictionary to keep by your side.  For a similar investment, however, you might consider the vastly more thorough 1000-page PENGUIN Dictionary of Literary Terms  and Literary Theory (4th edn by Cuddon &amp; Preston, 1998, ISBN: 0140513639 ) - possibly out of print as of this writing, but a bargain reference at the used price being asked by some Amz connections [ perhaps Penguin is on verge of releasing a 5th edition? ]. <br />For more *depth* of coverage for important literary concepts and controversies, serious literary students will more appreciate the BEDFORD Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms (Murfin &amp; Ray, 1998).  While the Oxford aims more at comprehensiveness in including terms (so that the reader can find &quot;memoir-novel&quot; and &quot;misprision&quot; for example), the Bedford strives for depth of explorations and interrelations of terms (a dictionary that could be considered &quot;authored&quot; as well as edited) - see review at ISBN 0312115601 .  <br />In summary, OXFORD is a *concise* dictionary; PENGUIN is a comprehensive dictionary; BEDFORD is a stimulating exploration and integration of terms and concepts.	2003-06-07

And yet, despite reading observations from numerous wise perspectives that Dante's insight, vision and creative genius were rivals to Shakespeare...  getting myself up to sufficient speed on the historical, literary, and religious context of The Divine Comedy was too daunting.  <br />Professor Chiarenza's finely written little volume has proved just what I needed to help inspiration overcome inertia.  Brief background chapters offer an interesting survey of 1) Historical context, 2) The Importance of the Work, and 3) Its critical reception.  Then she devotes a chapter each to Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.  A pleasingly written explication of the complex dynamics of each afterlife realm offers refreshing clarity without overwhelming the newcomer.  The author's ability to present the grandness of the poet's accomplishment conveys her love for the material without reducing herself to mere emotional gushing - offering the reader a sense of real reverence for this artist and his art that reminds me of Helen Vendler's ability simultaneously to inspect and respect creative greatness.<br />The spiritual height to which Dante reached in order to wet his quill with inky grace comes strongly through in this sensitive survey. <br />Although out of print at the moment, if found in a used copy, this volume will bless the reader who is open to develop or expand an appreciation of Dante. Highly recommended.	2003-06-04

Concerns about Elizabethan/Jacobean politics and religion are given extended space.<br />Traditional areas of study are mined for relevance to tragedy. For example, Russ McDonald's chapter on language explicates how rhetoric and its language are weapons as significant to the development of a Shakespearean tragedy as are swords or poisons. David Bevington tackles the fascinating interface of author/artwork to help us consider how/why Shakespeare's artistry developed across his varied approaches to tragic form. Michael Warren helps the beginner appreciate why (seemingly academic issues such as) 'textuality' and 'early performance' are vitally linked to the what-and-why behind tragic struggles and heroes.<br />Often a single chapter cannot hope to more than scratch the surface of an enormous complex of issues (e.g., Catherine Belsey on &quot;Gender and Family&quot;).  But in surveys these shortcomings are unavoidable, and the chapters give overviews that are fair and effective.<br />My primary wish for an enhanced edition would concern the appended &quot;Select Bibliography&quot; - it would be more helpful if broken into sections by subject.  Better yet, a &quot;Recommended Further Readings&quot; section at the end of each chapter (as in other Cambridge Companions) would be of more help to the student who wished to research in more depth.<br />All in all, this Companion is a highly recommended starting point for any reflective reader to broaden their perspective to span such disparate works as Titus, Romeo-Juliet, and Hamlet - and broaden their appreciation of the Bard's achievements.	2003-06-02

It is also much more. Within these 420 pages, the authors have taken time and space to explore in depth the significance of varied approaches to literary analysis and scholarship.<br />The confusing and politicized nature of 20th Century literary criticism is served well in Murphin &amp; Ray's clear and even-handed explication of various schools and styles.  I think that new initiates to literary studies will appreciate the lengthy analyses given to critical schools/styles ( from aestheticism and close reading... to new historicism and 'theory' ).  I find that this humbly titled &quot;glossary&quot; offers clearer and fairer insights into of these stormy academic seas that most books claiming &quot;Intro to Criticism&quot; in their titles.<br />This is a great reference volume for literature students. My only disappointment was the lack of references, and of suggestions for reading in more depth (other than in-passing mention of authors' names and occasional book titles), but that of course would have taken this volume further beyond the class of mere &quot;glossary&quot;. <br />Still, in summary: indispensable - unsurpassed!	2003-06-01

I sought out this volume with high expectations: Shakespeare. Edited by the eminent scholar Stanley Wells. Published by Oxford University Press. Published 2003. Once again we understand why Hamlet urged, \\"believe none of us.\\"<br />This is the same material released by Oxford with a copyright of 1985, 1986, and 1989. Therefore, the present review applies to all the following ISBNs: 0192804464, 0192820265, 0198129467.  The issues differ only in cover. All have pages of newsprint quality paper, meaning that if you are really studying the poems and highlighting or annotating the works, then you'll have ink blurs from one page through to the next.<br />And with this edition you will NEED to make annotation - there is none provided. Even the inexpensive editions from Signet, Penguin, and Folger provide aids to understanding archaic words and obscure allusions and wordplay (which offers so much delight to the sonnets and reveals the intellectual power of their author).<br />There is evidence that Professor Wells *has* left his well-respected mark on editing the poems, since an appendix documents which substantive changes he made to the original 1609 printing.  Unfortunately, the novice reader is not offered any of the professor's decades of scholarship regarding the ART and SIGNIFICANCE of these most personal of Shakespeare's writings (nor any of the debatable points that arise when one proclaims one knows better than the 1609 Quarto what the Bard \\"really meant\\".<br />RECOMMENDATIONS: For similar money, readers will reap much finer appreciation of Shakespeare from other volumes of Shakespeare's Sonnets (& other nondramatic poems):<br />William Burto's edition of 2002 (also from Oxford): 019281933X<br />G. B. Evans's edition of 1996 (from Cambridge): 0521294037<br />And ESPECIALLY:<br />Katherine Duncan-Jones' edition of 1997 (Arden Press): 1903436575.<br />These volumes also explore the fascinating (if convoluted) probable links between the Sonnets and \\"A Lover's Complaint,\\" originally published with it in 1609.<br />RECOMMENDATIONS for ADVANCED STUDENTS: English majors will want to go further and acquire Stephen Booth's most extensive, annotated-on-steroids edition from Yale: 0300085060 (see my review there). Committed lovers of the Sonnets owe it to themselves to own and savor Helen Vendler's \\"Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets\\" (reviewed at ISBN: 0674637127  ).<br />A wholehearted exploration of the Sonnets requires sustained stretching of a mortal's intellect, but an explorer with such expansiveness will be rewarded with a lifetime of  riches: intellectual, aethetic, and spiritual. Unfortunately, this present example of unannotated, uninspired presentation of them will launch a reader on an abortive mission. You and Shakespeare *deserve* one of the better editions.	2003-05-28

Modern readers cannot imagine what a different significance there was 400 years ago for writing, for drama, for the creation of arts or for the grappling with politics or social policy. Kinney's volume is an excellent launching point for a literary reader to get perspective on the cultural constraints and opportunities that birthed Sidney, Spenser, Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, et al. <br />If your focus is primarily on Shakespeare, you may do as well to consider some of the other Cambridge Companions\\" volumes: either \\"...Companion to Shakespeare\\" or \\"...to Shakespeare Studies\\" or \\"...to Shakespeare on Stage.\\" (or if pursuing other authors, to... Jonson, Spenser, etc.).  In Kinney's volume, however, you find a broader inclusion of the wide-ranging forces impinging on the writing environment of the 1590s. Without having to consult separate volumes on Authorship or 16th century lyric or the patronage system, the reader finds here excellent scholarly surveys of fifteen crucial regions of writerly concern. <br />The authors' conclusions are generally well referenced through notes (end of each chapter) and provide helpful recommendations for further reading by topic. <br />Additionally, there are chronologies of the 16th century at the front of the book which help you place literary, social and political in temporal relations to each other. Overall, an excellent investment in your appreciation of the gestation and birth of renaissance English literature.	2003-05-26

K. Rowling has been very quiet about her own inner thinking about how the HP stories work out and how to think about their themes and messages except to insist that they are \\"very moral\\" and are \\"about good and evil.\\" Her silence may have preserved suspense in readers - to their delight and frustration. Fans (and skeptics) about HP will find a lot of helpful information in Granger's volumes. He presents lots of facts, diagrams, and tables of parallels about names and words used in the books, and builds a very strong case that Rowling has carefully crafted a Christian symbology as the basis for her septology.<br />If would-be Christian censors would consider just a few striking and undeniable symbols employed, they would surely blush that they ever trashed the books as \\"satanic\\" or \\"un-Christian.\\" A couple obvious examples: the Malfoy step-parents, Lucius & Narcissa. Narcissa is an overt feminization of the unflattering \\"Narcissus\\", the negativity of which encourages the reader to see that Rowling has used \\"Lucius\\" to suggest (if not stand for) Lucifer [ which would be way too heavy-handed ]. Then consider that \\"Malfoy\\" would mean \\"bad faith\\" in French. And \\"Draco\\"?: Latin for dragon or serpent.<br />As soon as Granger got me asking about what names meant, one look at \\"Harry Potter\\" made it obvious where he would go. Potter -- molder of clay, right? Granger helpfully cites Biblical passages specifically referring to God as the potter who create humanity. <br />CAUTION ONE: I have to take Granger's conclusions as *starting points* rather than accept them as revelations. Consider, for example his explanation of \\"Why 'Harry' \\"? He acknowledges \\"Harry\\" as a nickname for Henry or Harold, but goes instead to a big stretch based on the silence of the \\"h\\" for Brits to say Harry -> 'airy' -> \\"heir-y\\" -> son of... With the idea that \\"Harry Potter\\" is supposed to mean \\"son of God\\" (though not with a capital \\"s\\". That's still a huge, awkward stretch. So much simpler is to seethat Harry -> Harold -> herald: suggesting that HP is to be at least the \\"herald of God\\" or spokesman for Good.<br />CAUTION TWO: Although the books is reader-friendly and very casual and chattily written, the very casualness of its self-publication has left some weaknesses that leave me feeling that I would need double-check any of Granger's information before relying on it. Glaring example, although Granger is said to have a degree in Classics from Univ Chicago, his reliance on memory (and no literary editor, I guess) to say, \\"More than one Shakespeare play is about 'Harry Hotspur' (the Prince of Wales). Well: no! Harry, Prince of Wales (future Henry V) was *opposed* by another \\"Harry Hotspur\\" (slew him, in fact). Rowling takes a lot more care in researching and planning her names than Granger does, apparently. Unfortunately, Granger's book needs to be used as a *source of ideas* - not a basis for facts.<br />OFFENDNG HIS READERS: Maybe it's just my pet peeve, but doesn't a writer/publisher compromise self by including a list of recommended reading on Rowling/HP (Appendix B) and then includes a glowing review of this very book!? That is not necessary. It is certainly not the sort of shenanigan that an established publisher would permit. <br />Keeping these caveats in mind, Granger does pull together a good armload of ammunition for how to think about Harry and his author in positive Christian terms.	2003-04-17

Bloom *does* acknowledge that &quot;Shakespeare is my model and my mortal god...&quot;(p. 2), so &quot;Hamlet: Poem Unlimited&quot; could be seen as his personal testament and hymnal. <br />But as a robe-bearing member of the Bardology choir, I am dissappointed that the symphony of Shakespearean stimulations and provocations  Bloom provided in &quot;Invention of the Human&quot; and in &quot;Genius&quot; is weakly orchestrated here.  Hamlet is the St. Paul of your church, Professor. Does he not deserve a Missa Solemnis  after feeding your soul for so many decades of life?  (The volume is a mere 154 pages - and perhaps *half*  are quotations of the play.) Because Hamlet so dominates most of Bloom's recent titles, when the self-proclaimed bardolosaurus finally dedicated a book to him fans could hope for a &quot;book unlimited&quot; on this Poem Unlimited. I was so saddened to find it more a &quot;book uncontrolled.&quot;<br />Picking up a copy in a book shop I found that I was able to read this title  in a half-hour. During those few minutes, Bloom made few new connections for me. His reflections about the play scarcely presented  a book of Revelation to cap off his career writing the New Testament of Shakespeare. And although this is probably a necessary title for those who want to read everything that has ever been thought about Hamlet, it will not be  an easy read if you are not steeped in the play and the wealth of thought it has inspired over the centuries. (Do not make this an introductory gift to a novice you would like to beckon to the Church of Shakespeare.) No notes, no index, no guidance as to where to go to explore any idea or commentator here cited that intrigues you.<br />Bloom owns that this little essay-dressed-out-as-book is  just a postlude to his &quot;Invention of the Human&quot; (necessarybecause he got distracted by the Ur-Hamlet issue in writing the earlier book and did not write the Hamlet chapter he meant to include there). Yet, given its own volume, and given Hamlet's central place in Bloom's theology/bardology I expected some wealth of new insights - or comprehensive overview. Alas, alas.<br />A final caveat. Heed the author's up-front warning: &quot;Much of 'Hamlet: Poem Unlimited' devotes itself to meditative surmises upon Shakespeare's involvement in the mysteries of his final Hamlet.&quot;(p.2) Truly: more surmises than analyses or even explorations. Allow me to prophesy:  most readers will be annoyed to pay for a book that is half quotations and filled out with *surmises*. Compulsive Shakespeare collector that I am, I will probably own a copy some day to examine more closely - out of my curiosity over how Shakespeare affects the professor's mind. But from my quick stand-up read in the store I've decided to wait till it's available for a couple bucks in a remainder bin.	2003-04-14

Additionally, I would save unsuspecting buyers some money.<br />Note first that Howard Staunton, the editor of &quot;The Globe Illustrated Shakespeare&quot; died in 1874. That is how current this edition is. Unfortunately modern corporations continue to reprint this woefully out-dated version of Shakespeare (the long-deceased editor requiring no royalty payments) and assign a &quot;publication date&quot; that makes this reprint sound contemporary.  [Publisher names associated with this uncritical approach to reproducing Shakespeare may vary. This &quot;Globe Illustrated&quot; printing has come out under publisher names &quot;Gramercy&quot;, &quot;Random House VALUE&quot;, and (in 1983) &quot;Greenwich House&quot;.] Caveat, caveat, caveat emptor!<br />Do not assume that &quot;Shakespeare is Shakespeare&quot;. This version may be great &quot;for your collection&quot; but you will not find yourself wanting to dip into the Bard's momental works here. It is NOT accurate. Scholarship has advanced so far in the past century that those in the know LAUGH at many of the editorial decisions that were passed along in Staunton's day.<br />Rather than repeat here my thoughts about better editions, please see the discussion in the review of one of the Gramercy printings ( ISBN 0517053616 ) for REWARDING editions of Shakespeare [ e.g., those published by Arden/Routledge, Oxford, Addison-Wesley (ed.: David Bevington), Penguin ].<br />Do your love of Shakespeare some justice and do not support this attractive *looking* offer.<br />PS: The illustrations are quaint Victorian fantasies - obscuring rather than illustrating what the Elizabethan master achieved. For an appreciation of how we may finally reach back to the original Shakespearean intent (without Victorian filters), please see Fintan O'Toole's recently re-released &quot;Shakespeare is Hard, but So Is Life&quot; (search for Amz ISBN 186207528X ).e-released &quot;Shakespeare is Hard, but So Is Life&quot; (search for Amz ISBN 186207528X ).	2003-04-11

O'Toole arms teachers, individual readers, and potential directors with insights that will restore excitement to the experience of Shakespeare.<br />O'Toole is obviously as enthusiastic about his subject as Harold Bloom is, but his writing is careful, witty, and well thought out, with specific examples to back up his &quot;radical&quot; guide. Even the beginning Shakespearean will easily follow O'Toole's important placement of The Plays within their Elizabethan context: a turbulent time of social upheaval and personal insecurity (easy to appreciate early in this 21st Century).  More experienced readers and teachers will (hopefully) enjoy being challenged to expand the narrow boxes in which recent generations have attempted to capture Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, and Lear. The &quot;tragic hero&quot; and his &quot;tragic flaw&quot; (for example) are seen to be unnecessary distortions imposed by Victorian lenses. &quot;See farther&quot; - as Shakespeare might say. <br />You may want to quibble with some of the author's interpretations, but you'll come away respecting O'Toole's honesty and clarity, and will no doubt savor new insights into many details of the play (it was not just for show that toads, nails, and witches are included in the dramas). Both little details and long-disected classic overarching issues (e.g., &quot;Why did Hamlet delay?&quot;) come into brighter light. <br />Warning to teachers: O'Toole will incite your students to think outside the boxes that have usually facilitated pat answers to essay asignments. <br />Eminently readable and engaging.	2003-04-10

But if you are serious about investing your time and energy in web design and development, particularly if you are still mixing CSS (Style Sheets) and HTML markup unsystematically according to what seems to patch up your site's function (mea culpa), you owe it  to yourself to check this out. Even if you just browse the first two chapters standing in a book store (sorry, authors), READ IT!<br />Ordinarily, I would not have cared much about another 'history of the web' except that theirs (chapter 1) explained WHY and HOW changes from simple HTML to more efficient developments (esp. CSS) can vastly SIMPLY and empower the way your web design proceeds, enhancing: 1) accessibility of your site, 2) speediness of your site, 3) and best of all speed of your development and revision work.<br />Although I agree that some exposure to CSS (even just from an introductory web design book) will make the going easier when you read this volume, from Briggs et al. you will finally learn the principles of WHY you save time and money by beginning your design with CSS (instead of just HTML/XHTML) and HOW the units of CSS work.  It's like getting your first real understanding of how to do (virtually) all your work on a computer - when you had been clunking along trying to hang on to the familiarity of a typewriter for half your tasks.<br />Finally, I have to express a real appreciation for the thoroughness of the presentations and the humanity of the writing style - no ranting, no hype - just thoughtful analysis of the state of this art/science and how to cope with its quirks and potentials. I enjoyed their tasteful, wry humor, agreeably sprinkled where appropriate - and the big laugh I got when I decided to look at the authors' pictures.

Every book I've seen on LEARNING CSS is not comprehensive the way Meyer's \\"Reference\\" volume is.<br />Of course, it IS a reference volume - not an introduction. Therefore (as some reviewers note) even the introductory material is not sufficiently elementary for the novice. The word REFERENCE is in the title, however, so I don't fault this book for not providing what it didn't promise to provide. So, beginners, feel free to buy the book now - because you'll want it to refer to. But get your grounding in a more basic book. Meyer's 2000 \\"Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide\\" could use its second edition, but is a great way to begin when you have this \\"Reference\\" volume to check the latest info on CSS and browsers supported.<br />And, if you're need persuading to minimize your HTML and move forward with Style Sheets, at least skim the first couple chapters of Owen Briggs. et al.'s \\"Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation\\" (ISBN 1904151043 ) They quickly helped me see why not to waste time and power on mere HTML when I'm involved in a complex web site - especiallly when growth and adaptations are planned over the years.	2003-03-06

Yogananda's expositions on Kriya Yoga (one expression of the meditative science of raja yoga) make it clear that systematic, scientific practice of proven techniques of clearing the mind and body are of utmost importance in helping one to open and expand the limited human heart.  <br />Yogananda's classical spiritual instruction goes on to describe the importance of developing the ''right attitude'' in all activities and especially in the practice of one's yoga and meditation.  Let this collection of wise and loving insights from Daya Mata serve as an inspiration for you to develop YOUR OWN personal relationship with the Creator.  If at present you find the appeal limited (or the value unclear) of employing PERSONAL concepts for drawing closer to the Invisible Infinite, you might appreciate reading Yogananda's chapter, &quot;Is God Personal or Impersonal?&quot; in his volume &quot;Man's Eternal Quest&quot; (ISBN 0876122322 ).	2003-02-17

Sort of a Shakespeare Survey for 10th graders. A somewhat oversized paperback, its 304pp are printed in large type with colored emphasis, presumably to attract the younger reader. In a relatively few words, \\"Everything\\" succeeds rather well in surveying everything and leaving a newcomer primed to explore more deeply in the mind and works of the great author. There are appendices on further readings, resources, and web sites, but these are weakly annotated, so a beginner will need additional guidance.<br />The \\"Everything\\" style is to highlight certain sections as \\"Essentials\\" and others as \\"Facts.\\" I can't imagine that the \\"Essentials\\" often reflect what a school teacher is going to be quizzing, let alone what serious students would call a central issue. I also notice that the \\"Facts\\" are sometimes highly unfactual (\\"Some scholars feel the sonnets are...\\"). \\"Facts\\" is a daring words to employ anywhere in the realm of Shakespeare. Hamlet could have been speaking most candidly and fittingly for Shakespearean authors: \\"Believe none of us!\\" (i.e., In God we trust - for the rest we check footnotes). On the other hand, this mostly un-documented survey does at least acknowledge many of the debates that remain unfinished about the times, the man, and his works. <br />Overall, it's not a bad compromise between readability and honest scholarly equivocation in a book for young bard novices. If they continue on with Shakespeare they'll have time enough to be disabused of the \\"facts\\" they've learned.<br />Brief introductions to each play fill out the second half the book after the first has given you chapters on Shakespeare's World, The Elizabethan Stage, Did Shakespeare Write Shakespeare, Shakespeare's Rivals (nine discussed), Elizabethan English, and The Sonnets/Poems.	2003-02-09

Swami Sri Yukteswar (1855-1936), whose westernly-known disciple was Paramahansa Yogananda, was a quiet, demanding Bengali teacher of Kriya Yoga, the advanced form of raja (meditative) yoga that Yogananda has made so popular in the west.  Sri Yukteswarji, however, did not have the effusive, entertaining style of his popular disciple, nor did he write in as easily accessible manner.  This slender volume is nevertheless to be highly recommended to the serious student of yoga philosophy or raja practice, and especially to students of Kriya Yoga, for whom Sri Yukteswar's penetrating insights will fit together important puzzle-pieces of the yoga spiritual path.  (Beginners to yoga philosophy and  practice would be well advised first to read Yogananda's \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" -- perhaps a few times and taking in even the technical footnotes -- before tackling \\"The Holy Science.\\" )<br />The swami defines his volume's purpose to be: showing the essential unity of *all* religions.  It is, but the  emphasis definitely centers on parallels between John's gospel and Revelation and the yoga principles of India's Sankhya philosophy \\"Sanatan Dharma.\\"  Some of the most arresting parallels presented concern the way both teachings present concepts of \\"The Word\\", \\"Holy Baptism\\", and \\"Messiah/Satguru\\".  Sri Yukteswarji does not expend extra words attempting to make unity persuasive to those who have a dogmatic conviction that their religion (Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, or whatever) has the \\"true\\" hold on \\"truth,\\" so those who are so persuaded can safely skip this work.  If, however, you have always had a nagging intuitive sense that there ought to be One Truth behind all versions of religious truth, time spent to assimilate the swami's realizations will be well repaid.<br />As a bonus there is a fascinating introductory chapter which explains India's macro-astrology and the astronomical progression of the equinoxes ( the phenomenon which leads western astrologers to speak of the coming  \\"age of Aquarius\\").  This introduction to the Indian astrological system reveals it to be remarkably sophisticated -- offering reason to pause and reflect on the implications of a possible cyclical nature of *spiritual* ages (\\"yugas\\" to India) -- and new hope that humanity's spirituality will start to catch up with its technology... providing we attend to our dharmas!<br />Not an *easy* read -- but if you think you're ready for it, it can be an extremely rewarding one.<br />PS: Although as of this writing the Amazon photo of the jacket makes this appear to be the Spanish translation of the work, this ISBN ( 0876120516 ) is actually correct for the English language edition.	2002-12-19

This collection of Daya Mata's talks includes some of her most intimate experiences during the twenty years of yoga training she spent with Paramahansa Yogananda, including the instantaneous healing that she had upon first meeting him in 1931 and her NDE (clinical death) experience around 1951.  Many of the chapters are transcripts of such intensely moving personal sharings that Sri Daya Mata only reluctantly shared with small groups of devotees on rare occasions when she received a clear inner sanction  (most were previously available only on tape recordings).  <br />The availability in book form of these intimate spiritual revelations is a memorable blessing to those who value the chance to dip back into the peak moments of a yogi-saint of untainted stature.  Sri Daya Mata's own ego is illusive as she ever lets herself slide into the background, dedicating all action and credit to \\"God and Guru.\\"  In her interactions with her teacher we see in turn how he dedicated himself to \\"God and (his) Guru...\\" and so on ad inifinitum.  <br />As one of Mataji's close associates put the challenge:  although the average materialist thinks that it signifies a weak will to turn over one's will to Divine Guidance, in fact it takes EXTRAORDINARY will power to follow divine will when the ego is saying 'go this way' and the trivial momentary desires of the body are saying 'go that way.'   In Sri Daya Mata's style and substance we see how the power, creativity and beauty of spirit shine through when the ego reaches that paradoxical pinnacle of spirituality: humility.	2002-12-15

This collection of fifty public talks and reflective essays spans an amazing universe of human issues from the perspective of a yoga master who was trained in his youth by one of the most revered sages of India and who went on to Europe and the Americas to train tens of thousands of westerners in the practicalities and spiritualities of RAJA YOGA.  Raja Yoga means literally, 'royal' or complete yoga - not just the calisthenics of the average superficial class taught in a modern gym.  Raja Yoga subsumes the same essence of ethical, cosmological, and practical teaching that runs like a silver thread through the original fabrics of Judeo-Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, and Hindu teachings (though ignored by dogmatic sectarians and muscle-bound materialists alike).  <br />Take as a first gift, chapter one: How Seekers First Found God.  For perhaps the first time in the English we have a clear explanation and follow-up to Christ's puzzling pair of directions:  Seek first The Kingdom / The Kingdom of God is within you.  Yogananda gives us an unsurpassed overview of thousands of years of yoga experimental scientists studied HOW to \\"seek the kingdom within:\\"   Here we learn WHY we are instructed to \\"be still and know that I am God\\" (PS 46:10) -- because stillness is necessary for us to go deeper (and higher) than sense perception to hear the omnipresent whispering of Spirit to our souls.  Because the press of \\"civilization\\" urges us to be active and outer-directed, we are strangers to the very qualities that would help us experiences our soul-natures and our souls' yearning to express its divinity.  The yoga methods of relaxation for body, breath and mind are beneficial to pursuers of ALL religions -- even to those of NO religion who yearn to awaken a higher level of functioning in mind and purer health in body -- for yoga is truly the original WHOLISTIC system. Raja Yoga shows how ALL human functioning can be optimized, including (if you're so inclined) the human search forits divinity.<br />Throughout the variegated chapters of this volume you will find that the lotus of yoga blossoms in every realm of human existence: health, personal relationships, psychotherapy, and all spiritual searches.  As the \\"complete\\" yoga instruction, Raja Yoga considers the importance of evolving your human work as spiritual work:  in outer activity, heart-felt devotion, and discriminative rationality.  But Yogananda always takes the reader back to the unique CORE of Raja Yoga:  deep, single-pointed meditation upon the Unifying Source of our beings.  <br />It is impossible to describe the volume because it is so EXPANSIVE in the applications it makes of yoga teaching.  Yet it offers a fundamental yoga lesson because it is also FOCUSED... in ever returning you to the unifying principle of all religions, all human yearnings, all quests:  the empowerment of your being with the experience, knowing, and love of the soul.  <br />PS:  You might reasonably doubt the authority of any author to offer advice that promises so much.  The preface by Sri Daya Mata to this volume gives a close student's tantalizing glimpse of the author's stature and of his practices-what-he-preaches authenticity.  For a look in more depth at the genuine humility with which this exalted soul expressed his insights, please see his Autobiography of a Yogi in his expanded 1951 edition, in either quality paperback...or mass paperback...	2002-12-14

In these &quot;songs&quot; from the 1920s and 1930s when he traveled the United States on lecture tour, Paramahansa Yogananda reveals a sweet humility reminiscent of St. Theresa of Lisieux.  It may be surprising that a master of yoga disciplines expresses himself in such devotional, personal terms to both his Heavenly Creator and to his earthly charges... but such was his nature.  The language is often simple, but occasionally it surprises the reader with striking metaphors and turns of a phrase that belie English as the author's second language.<br />Here are the opening and closing lines from one of my personal favorites; it shows the master's love for his disciples... and the master's love for His Master.<br />&quot;WHEN I AM ONLY A DREAM&quot;<br />I come to tell you all of Him,<BR>And the way to encase Him in your bosom,<BR>And of the discipline that brings His grace.<BR>. . .<BR>But when I shall become only a memory, or a<BR>   mental image, or silently speaking voice,<BR>When no earthly call will ever reveal<BR>My whereabouts in unplumbed space...<BR>I will come to remind you that you too are naught<BR>But a dream of my Heavenly Beloved;<BR>And when you know you are a dream,<BR>   as I know now,<BR>We will be ever awake in Him.	2002-12-06

The author, younger brother Sananda, vividly relates the powerful effect on the entire family of having a child saint in its midst.  Stories demonstrating young Yogananda's rare combination of devotion, will, and divine atunement will remind you of how the child Jesus impressed adult relatives.  And yet he certainly was a boy during those early years - playing pranks, gradually learning lessons, and steadily expanding the spiritual burden he was to shoulder as an adult teacher in Europe and the Americas.  <br />If you have ready his Autobiography and crave further connection with Yogananda's spirit, pick up  &quot;Mejda&quot; - you'll not be disappointed.  Sananda brings alive many astounding experiences he and his saintly brother shared - stories not available anywhere else in print.  <br />Don't neglect the appended Q&amp;A and Discourses sections.  Even if you've been taking Yogananda's Self-Realization Lessons in meditation, you'll find some unique points pertaining to the Bhagavad Gita, how reincarnation happens, the role of life force in yoga, etc. in these appendices.	2002-12-03

For the most part, I believe the sense to be faithfully preserved...&quot;<br />One definite quibble about the translation is made explicit in Yogananda's autobiography where he notes that virtually *every* translator of The Gita into English mistakes Krishna as instructing his disciples to meditate with the gaze focused on &quot;the tip of the nose.&quot;  Yogananda points out that the Sanskrit &quot;nasikagam&quot; actually means &quot;source&quot; or &quot;root&quot; of the nose -- a reference to *the point between the eyebrows* - the &quot;spiritual eye&quot;.  For an esoterically sophisticated appreciation of such subtle (but vital) translation issues, you may want to turn to Yogananda's illumined commentary on the Gita:  &quot;God Talks with Arjuna.&quot; (ISBN: 0876120303 )	2002-12-03

As of this writing, Amazon stocks only the red hardback (no dust jacket) \\"First Version\\" from 1929 ( ISBN 0876121024 ), but given a date of 1998 in the Amazon listing.  Yogananda revised and enlarged his original 1929 volume in 1939, and this second version has been released in several editions (9th in 1986) by Self-Realization Fellowship (ISBN 0876121032), attractively illustrated with monochrome and color inspirational photographs. The second version (those words do not appear prominently in it or on it) is gorgeous, but you may have to acquire it directly from the publisher, and it does omit some remarkable, highly spontaneous works contained in the First Version.<br />The publisher explains that the reprinting of the First Version since 1981 (with the later date: 1998 in Amazon's listing: ISBN 0876121024 ), was released because sentiment for the earlier version persisted among some of his most devoted followers.  \\"This volume is a photographic reproduction of the (1929) work with omission only of four readings used in Self-Realization Fellowship ceremonies...\\"  Although the modernized later version makes a better gift to a newcomer to Yogananda, long-time students will really appreciate the intimate feel of many of the early wordings.  In particular, the First Version includes his \\"Prayer at Dawn\\", \\"Prayer at Noon\\" ( in the wordings you can still hear in recordings of the yoga master's own voice), \\"Prayer-Demand Before Taking Food\\", etc.<br />The First Version's introduction also has an interesting explanation of why Yogananda's title (Paramahansa) sometimes appeared as Paramhansa in early work (a function of Bengali pronunciation's tendency to drop the middle 'a' sound) and why the full word param-ahansa (supreme swan) is the clearer communication of the Sanskrit title.  <br />In either version, the prayers, loving demands, chants, and poems are touching reflections of the great master's intimate connection with the Divine -- his Mother-Father-Friend-Beloved, as he would humbly address Spirit.  No cold, carefully reasoned theology here -- just pure and simple love.	2002-11-28

If it contained only his opening essay from 1943, \\"How to Cultivate Divine Love\\", this volume would more than warrant the cover price: it is persuasive, revelatory, show-stopping.  Everyone talks about love. Everyone is moved by an unconscious yearning for this intangible indispensible. After lifetimes of pursuing and then achieving the Source of Love, in this seventeen-page essay Yogananda offers a timeless explanation of this elusive be-all and end-all of our existence.  For those that confuse Love with sex or who cannot imagine that any love can surpass their feelings for their child or their beloved, these words are probably wasted.  But for those who have been graced by even a whiff of the Creator's love or have intuitively felt that behind the temporary world of human ecstasies must lie a Divine Source and Experience, these words will ring as truth: this author has tasted The Whole Loaf, not just enjoyed wafting aromas.  No matter how often it is distorted and dimmed in its human expressions, the irresistable pull of Divine Love keep working on us, because, as Yogananda explains...<br />\\"If you could feel even a particle of divine love, so great would be your joy -- so overpowering -- you could not contain it.\\"  It is from connection with that Divine that the faces of long-silent, meditating yogis of India beam with unrepentant Joy, that the whirling Sufi dervish tirelessly dances without apparent partner.  With unblinking insight and full compassion, Yogananda reflects on the varied places and degrees of human success in finding lasting love, because \\"...by investigating human love, we can learn something of divine love, for in human love we have glimpses of that love of God's.\\"<br />As devotional as he is, Yogananda goes far beyond gushing.  He provides useful anaysis of the ways human beings are \\"clever in their ignorance\\" and avoid achieving the very End they so desperately crave.  Near the end of \\"How to Cultivate...\\" he brings us back on track to the systematic, selfless practices of ecumenical meditation upon the Source of our being, the Source of all love:<br />... \\"If you meditate deeply, a love will come over you such as no human tongue can describe; you will know (Divine Love), and you will be able to give that pure love to others.\\"  Yogananda's pronouncements ring with the unmistakable authority of someone who KNOWS, who has been there, who has practiced and seen the results.  Throughout this volume's forty-seven chapters we learn about the universality of spirituality across all religions and all ages, and we hear from someone with a cosmic, ages-long perspective about the path we have been climbing (often unconsciously) and about means for speeding our ascent.  As he both explains and exemplifies, Yogananda insists that even though the path requires periods of dedicated solitude, it is not solitary:  single-pointed love for God also means serving children of the Divine.<br />When you read \\"Divine Romance\\" you will probably identify some chapters as 'the best.'  My own experience suggests this is just a function of what the reader needs at the time.  They are all jewels,  sparkling with special appeal when they are shedding light on areas of particular darkness of particular days.  That being said, I'll still highlight some special essays:<br />\\"The Mind: Repository of Infinite Power\\" - Wisdom from the ancient-and-modern science of yoga on how to harness that wildest of human organs, the mind.  This chapter includes a blessed reminder for anyone who has studied the full three years of Yogananda's \\"SRF Lessons\\" on meditation and spiritual development.  So luxurious with methods and skills to practice are his teachings that students with perfectionist leanings sometimes feel close to giving up because of the impossibility of mastering ALL the practices described.  Reassuringly, the yoga master promises, \\"If you practice one millionth of the things that I tell you (in these teachings) you will reach God.\\"<br />\\"Personal and Impersonal God\\" - This powerful talk resolves the apparent contradiction of God being able to be both personal and impersonal.  Yogananda explains the important value in taking either perspective in our pursuit of The Divine.  He also explains the role of Christ and other personal manifestations of divinity in varied religious paths to The Transcendent.  <br />\\"How to Find a Way to Victory\\" - A brilliant essay that puts to shame all the shallow get-rich-quick books on 'success.'  He always keeps us conscious of how multi-faceted our striving must be -- even when it concerns particularly worldly outcomes.  As one who achieved these ends before attempting to teach others how to do so, Yogananda explains that outer victories always require inner victories first:  \\"He who becomes master of himself is a real conqueror.\\"  ...  \\"And in this inner victory, I find the whole world at my command. ...all things are made clear in the great light of God.\\"<br />Throughout the talks and essays of Divine Romance, Yogananda keeps returning us to our search for the Ultimate Kingdom of love and wisdom:  \\"To gain this wisdom of God is the only purpose for which you were sent here; and if you seek anything else intead, you are going to punish yourself.\\"  Gospel-like, n'est-ce pas?  Always ringing with Truth because here is someone who has walked the walk.  Enjoy!  --rp	2002-11-27

Here is a book to launch an exploration of literature, to heighten the appreciation of great minds of Western civilization.  Academics will be aggravated as usual by Bloom, his arrogant pronouncements, and his crowd-pleasing style.  It must be so: in his sunset years Bloom is unrepentantly rebirthing himself as an intellectual Sir John Falstaff.  And, Reader, if you will play young Prince Hal to Bloom's Sir John, you can enjoy his idiosyncratic hoodwinks and partake of his joie de vive!  <br />If you are among the multitudes for whom life has sometimes been at its most glorious among the dead (i.e., authors) and the never-living (their eternal characters), you will revel in this vast lyrical volume.  It is truly a poetical, not an analytic work (despite Bloom's employing an organizing principle of Kabbalistic schemata).  A love poem, at that -- erotically charged with both the fleshly and the mystical -- and unconcerned with superficial hobgoblins of consistency.  Bloom means to inspire, to provoke, to spur you to drink from these geniuses' original springs, and for vast numbers of readers who can overlook Sir Harold's foibles (or rejoice with them), he will succeed surpassingly.  <br />One could wish the grace of more helpful editing had befallen the professor's final work and caught some of his contradictions and carelessnesses; he deserved to have an editor require better explication of his &quot;definitions&quot; and more follow-through on his arguments. But my sadness over the omission of such polishing strokes does not diminish my enthusiasm in recommending this volume to friends.<br />Contrary to impressions given by some introductory statements, Bloom's analytical arguments about Genius and its roles in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of humanity are NOT the life force of this work.  As in his other best-sellers (Shakespeare; Western Canon) it is Bloom's real passion to play the pelican and feed us literary children the life-blood of his love for literature and its creators.  The very wildness of Sir Harold will aggravate the Prince Johns and Lord Chief Justices of the academies, but the Prince Hal within us will be positively infected with the need to pursue further intoxication among the Geniuses.  <br />Almost everybody will find *something* to be offended over somewhere in &quot;Genius&quot; -- since Sir Harold's extraordinary breadth of reading enables him to range over such a wide range of topics and his seniority has earned his personable-but-opinionated style a pronounced arrogance.  I suggest the reader savor a little humility and overlook those idiosyncracies -- while resting uncompelled to accept every unexplicated conclusion Bloom offers -- and focus instead on draining this work for all the inspiration and insights that are pleasurably scattered throughout it.  &quot;Genius&quot; passes the test that the professor in his introduction sets for any written work: &quot;...has my awareness been intensified, my consciousness widened and clarified?&quot;  Yes: Enjoy!	2002-11-18

There can never be an meaningful summary of such an expansive collection of spiritual talks.  &quot;Journey&quot; has 44 chapters, but truly hundreds of topics are covered, elucidating the complex puzzles of spiritual and material realms as they interact.  Practical guidance for beginners and advanced students alike intermingle with revelatory explanations of the working of the Cosmos and of its Creator. The ordering is not that of an encyclopedia because it is a collection of talks given for different reasons on different occasions - the ordering may well be called divine.  <br />An intellectual may scoff at the idea of divine illumination of any speaker, but monastics who used to accompany Yogananda on his lecture circuits have described how the process expressed itself.  Given a particular topic for the day's presentation, Yogananda's introduction would usually begin logically enough; but throughout the lecture seemingly unrelated issues would usually pop up, commence a digression, be tied back in with the main theme, and the main theme resume.  Afterwards, the monastic would not infrequently hear from audience members how they thought that they came to hear about the title-subject of the talk but were astonished to hear needed comforting/guiding paragraphs inserted that addressed some unspoken distress or dilemma in their lives.  <br />If you are open to seeing how the Divine can work in your life, just hold your question or need in mind for a few moments; then, in good faith, open the volume at seeming random and read a few pages.  There is such wisdom and attunement with the Creator in these pages that it is scarcely possible not to benefit.  If you try this experiment and can't see that there is a relation to what you think is your need... please be patient:  meditate and still the mind from its anxieties; the relevance of the yoga master's inspiration will almost always become clear.  If you come from a skeptical or scientific-linear background such as mine,it may take some time to ask with real, sincere surrender of the heart (not an attitude encouraged in our materialist/intellectualist culture).  But with developing relaxation, concentration, and the gradual opening of the heart one can learn to... ASK.  And will as a result... RECEIVE.<br />May I share a few samples of the wise comfort from this volume?<BR>&quot;I believe you can destroy any karma you want to. ... God as the master of this universe has no karma; if you KNOW that you are one with God, there can be no karma for you.&quot; (p. 232)<BR>&quot;In reacting to life, most people either say, 'Praise the Lord,' or urge us to be afraid of Him... I think this is very foolish.  What can you say to God that will be praise? He is not moved by flattery ...it will not make any difference to Him. But it will  make a difference in you.  Praise Him - or better still, LOVE Him - and you will feel better.&quot; (p. 39)<BR>&quot;Even when you do not have the opportunity to meditate long or deeply, always think that you are working for God. When your mind can remain anchored in Him, you will not suffer any more; no amount of disease or illness will be able to touch you inwardly.&quot; (p. 37)<br />Perhaps it will be helpful for the new reader to be reassured that although Yogananda often talks about the immense benefits to be reaped once you have mastered spiritual pinnacles (e.g., from above examples: &quot;if you know that you are one with God&quot; or &quot;love Him&quot; or &quot;When your mind can remain anchored in Him&quot;), you don't have to wait until you reach mastership to get benefits.  Although my experience does not allow me yet to confirm the blessings that come with full &quot;knowing&quot; or &quot;loving&quot; or &quot;anchoring&quot; -- I can testify that the more I practice and move toward these ideals, the greater the blessings I receive.  From the methods that Yogananda offers in these talks and in his other publications I have RECEIVED far more than I dared ASK for.  I wish the same for you.	2002-11-16

In 1920, when still at his teacher's ashram in India, Yogananda received an invitation to speak to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston, sponsored by the American Unitarian Association, thus beginning his three decades of teaching and work on this continent.  &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;religion&quot; are usually discussed as opposites or adversaries, as are &quot;reason&quot; and &quot;faith,&quot; but this expansion of his 1920 address to that congress brings the yoga approach: revealing the unities - in the most ancient and universal &quot;unitarian&quot; approach.<br />The very word &quot;religion&quot; has roots in &quot;unity:&quot; the Latin 'religare', which dictionaries often define unpleasantly as to restrain or to tie back; Yogananda cites the more yogic definition: to bind. To someone accustomed to the term &quot;yoga&quot; with its common roots in &quot;to yoke together&quot; or &quot;to unite,&quot; the positive implications become apparent for religion as a force of LIBERATION rather than of restraint.  If you are among the thousands who shun the contemporary uses of &quot;religious&quot; and say, with many of my friends, &quot;I am not so much a religious person as a spiritual person,&quot; you will appreciate Yogananda's use of this more universal and positive meaning of &quot;religious.&quot;<br />In this tightly reasoned essay on how ancient spiritual revelations from yoga science can elevate modern religion to liberating heights, Yogananda offers to even the most intellectual of audiences the best of reasons 1) why devotion to Truth and the experience of Spirit must logically go hand-in-hand and 2) how the airy realms of spirituality are pressingly practical: &quot;...religion necessarily consists in the permanet removal of pain and the realization of Bliss or God.&quot;<br />He moves forward to show the differences between the basic four approaches to spiritual realization (as described by another reviewer, below) and provides more fundamentals about meditation and esoteric yoga practice than his 1920 audience could possibly have coped with.  It is more accessible to our new, better-initiated century.  The Science of Religion is an introduction to the universality of yoga, meditation, and the experience of the Divine, and -- although lacking the fascinating annecdotes of his Autobiography of a Yogi or the inspirational upliftment of such later books as Where There is Light and The Divine Romance -- The Science of Religion is a powerfully reasoned call to the intellect to open its heart along with its mind.<br />RECOMMENDATION:  Especially good gift for your intellectual, agnostic friends - or those who have been alienated by narrow, orthodox, negativity-based presentations of religion.differences between the basic four approaches to spiritual realization (as described by another reviewer, below) and provides more fundamentals about meditation and esoteric yoga practice than his 1920 audience could possibly have coped with.

When the Yogananda brought the message of yoga to his students in the West he emphasized BALANCE, and the essays collected in ''To Be Victorious in Life'' are prime examples.  Always acknowledging the central role of attuning our consciousness to the Divine Will, Yogananda still insists that readers attend to the practicalities of life in the modern West.  If you read his Autobiography of a Yogi, you will see how successfully he employed this balance, establishing an America-wide and then a world-wide organization for dissemination of yoga-based principles of meditation, following the instruction of Christ to render appropriately unto Caesar and unto God.  In the talks transcribed for the chapters of this pocketbook, Yogananda speaks both from his spiritual wisdom and from his experience in translating spiritual principle into action within the world.<br />The importance of meditation and of practicing attunement with The Divine during wordly activity are given central importance throughout the yoga master's talks, but so are the application of will, discrimination, and self-discipline.  Yogananda thus also shows balance in encouraging us to listen to conscience while showing compassion for our weaknesses as we (works in progress that we are) build our spiritual muscles.  He discourages focusing on mistakes but instead emphasizes keeping the mind on The Goal and on studying the lives of those we would be proud to emulate.  We are ever urged just to do the best we can - and Yogananda's words have an amazing ability to build our faith in the goodness of ourselves and to foster a desire to bring out that goodness.<br />Always he wants to root out the mistakes - not to disparage the mistake-maker.  His encouragement here might best be summarized by his words elsewhere: ''God does not mind your mistakes - but your indifference!''	2002-11-13

The handsome and lavishly illustrated 1200-page, two-volume set is available in both a finely bound slipcased hardcover edition ... and a surprisingly inexpensive paperback printing ...  For a volume that will likely be reconsulted, Bible-like, many times over the years, the hardcover edition is to be recommended if your budget can possibly permit.<br />Each of the 700 Bhagavad Gita verses is presented in both Sanskrit and English.  More importantly, each verse is followed by commentary and expansion that integrates your study of  the Gita with the entire spiritual science of Raja (meditative) Yoga.  Hundreds of thoughtful commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita have been published over the centuries; some have been finely crafted by brilliant intellects; only a handful have come from realized sages; in this long-awaited Self-Realization Fellowship edition we have the insights of a soul who has experienced and mastered all the spiritual heights extoled by this dearest of Indian scriptures.<br />Yogananda dictated his commentaries to his most trusted students during retreats to the southern California desert during the late 1940s.  Those disciples related how the yoga master would, from his state of samadhi (conscious communion with God), pour out this uninterrupted stream of spiritual erudition throughout the night, surpassing the endurance of his much younger scribes.  One close disciple vividly recalls today how merely to enter the room during these divine dictations had the feel of being ''in the very presence of The Divine.''  In meditating lovingly upon his words in these volumes the modern reader may again dip into that Presence.<br />READING RECOMMENDATION:  These volumes are highly distilled spiritual liquor - unsuitable for casual guzzling. The extensive introduction alone provides a spiritual-eye-opening background to the Himalayan heights of India's most venerated scripture.  Yogananda therein explains how he applied the special intuitive approach to scripture taught him by his guru, the Puri sage Sri Sri Swami Yukteswarji.  From his ability to sustain the highest spiritual state of Nirbikalpa Samadhi, Yogananda would derive his Gita commentary by uniting his consciousness with that of the Gita's author, Vyasa, and of its principles, Bhagavan Krishna and disciple Arjuna.  Your intellectual analysis of Yogananda's resulting masterpiece will immediately impress your mind with his ability to reveal multiple levels of meaning from the complexities of the Sanskrit verses;  but it will require a gradual digestion of these meanings and quiet reflection (ideally: interspersed with periods of meditation) to begin to assimilate their spiritual potency.  As an example of 'gradual' I will mention the approach our local study groups took:  reading one page per day, then meeting weekly to meditate and share insights and questions.  At this rate the  two groups I facilitated each took three years to complete the two volumes - but provided us with our richest spiritual rewards ever. However you pace yourself, first of all SAVOR.  Then, best of all, PRACTICE... the guidance offered by Krishna, Vyasa, Arjuna, Yogananda:  meditate on The Divinity within and around you.<br />Namaste.  --rp	2002-11-13

If you are new to Yogananda's writing, you may think that How You Can Talk with God is a presumptuous title.  But if you have read his Autobiography of a Yogi, you know full well that this is no ordinary theoretical or inspirational author.  He prayed almost unceasingly from infancy - meditated almost as early - and received RESPONSES from The Divine.  Throughout his writings and in his SRF Meditation Lessons for his students Yogananda demonstrates the greatest faith in the truths he presents:  he discourages students from accepting his words blindly and urges them instead TO TEST their validity in the laboratories of their own lives, meditations, prayers.  This brief, to-the-point, power-packed book is no exception and is an excellent place to begin your exploration of Yogananda's brilliant writing and genuine love.<br />The fundamental thesis of How You Can Talk with God (HYCTWG) is displayed in its title: &quot;...WITH God&quot; not just &quot;...to God.&quot;  Like Saint Francis, Yogananda discerns prayer as TALKING to God and meditation as LISTENING to God;  this book Yogananda explains how we need to develop BOTH these parts of our soul-Spirit relationship.  The unique contribution of Yogananda's essay is to explain the power of classic yoga methods of meditation for clearing the mental static from our minds - and to introduce the power of the advanced Kriya Yoga methods that he continues to disseminate through Self-Realization Fellowship.  Not everyone is ready for the discipline required by the advanced Kriya methods (described more fully in Yogananda's Autobiography), but everyone can benefit from the simple beginning-level instruction offered in HYCTWG.<br />If you will carry this small gem in your pocket or pocket-book with you and dip into it during moments of stress, confusion, or just apathy, I think you will find yourself increasingly drawn to practice its principles of scientific meditation and personal prayer.  Hopefully,  the reality of the promised benefits of even deeper communion will gradually tug at your soul's deepest needs and spur you to the next level of study.  Then it's time to turn to the Autobiography or the instructions in HYCTWG for advanced Lessons.ised benefits of even deeper communion will gradually tug at your soul's deepest needs and spur you to the next level of study.

Yogananda addresses the ultimate questions that torment the heart of all sensitive human beings.

As in all his writings, Yogananda impresses upon the reader the importance of both our inner and outer work as contributions to our own lives and the world as a whole.  The overall effect of his teaching is to instill a positive vision of one's own place and work - a vision of grandeur and yet of humility - with an immediacy and  clarity unparalleled by any other writer in the modern age.	2002-11-11

This collection of Yogananda's inspired insights into our divine nature - and the challenges posed by our oppressive materialistic environments - is a powerful way to keep a true spiritual master's guidance at one's side.  <br />In a moment of distress or spiritual need, just open to any page and you will feel this master's wisdom lifting burdens off your shoulders.  <br />Highly recommended... for both the newcomer to spiritual awakening and the veteran devotee.  EXCELLENT GIFT for friends or family who may be new to Yogananda's brilliance or to Eastern spirituality as a whole.	2002-11-09

Books	4	29	31	N	N	Dive in... but keep your skepticism alert	Michell presents one of the liveliest and most wide-ranging surveys of the ''Shakespeare authorship'' question.  Refreshingly, his presentation is devoid of the rabies infecting most writers who have already wedded themselves to Stratfordian (orthodox), Baconian, Oxfordian, or Marlovian conclusions.  He keeps his sense of humor about the ironies of the arguments, and gives the reader an appreciation of how easy it is for those who only read one viewpoint to feel convinced that their candidate and explanation are the be-all and end-all.<br />Unfortunately, one volume cannot do justice to all the different data, issues, and perspectives needing consideration.  And although there is a considerable bibliography for further study, there are also unkind omissions:  Michell makes many statements and interpretations without citing his sources.  In the study of Shakespeare it is essential to go back to primary sources, following Hamlet's imperative: Believe none of us!  When some of Michell's pronouncements are tracked down, it turns out that they are not established fact but vigorously debated questions.<br />Nevertheless, Michell's volume is a much better place to start surveying the issues than those of true believers populating much of the Oxfordian, Baconian, and Stratfordian popular ranks.  Plus... it's an entertaining, fun read.	2002-11-09

Yogananda speaks from the perspective of one who has total commitment to Spirit and to us, Spirit's bewildered and earthbound creations.  Readers of varied religious backgrounds and different spiritual temperaments will all find something to spur them to higher practice of their own paths.<br />If you resonate with this non-sectarian, universal approach to spiritual growth, be sure also to read Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi for more  information on the powerfully liberating advanced meditation methods of Kriya Yoga that Yogananda teaches in his instructions through Self-Realization Fellowship (publisher of this volume).  Their web site ( Yogananda-SRF dot org ) provides a beautiful introduction to these meditation methods.	2002-11-09
US	52273646	R1ZL4RIY1KY1FT	0876120214	593595314	Spiritual Diary	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Words from a Divine Lover to start your every day	This pocket-size volume has a brief inspirational quotation (30-80 words) at the top of each page with blank space for recording your personal spiritual diary or reflections for each of the 365 days of the year. The inspirationals move through different themes through the year (devotion, peace, discipline, freedom, thankfulness, spiritual courage etc.), tying in with the season. Most are thoughts from Yogananda himself; a few are from his closest disciples.<br />I find that people adopt several uses for the book: 1) random opening of the book when you need a thought of spiritual guidance; 2) using a thought to start one's day right; 3) introspective focus for self-analysis in reviewing the day; 4) inspirational thought at close of a yoga class. Often it is uncanny how the thought of the day is exactly what one needed to hear: for reassurance, inspiration, prod to personal work, etc.<br />A few of the thoughts seem specifically tailored to students committed to a yogic spiritual path, but most are highly applicable to *any* spiritual seeker. If you valued reading any of Yogananda's classics such as Autobiography of a Yogi, Journey to Self-Realization, or The Divine Romance, you will enjoy this daily sampling of enlightenment.<br />Because it starts with January 1 and has no year attached to the days you can start tapping it any time of the year. It does, of course, make a wonderful gift during the December holidays because someone can start off their New Years resolutions spiritually with it.	2002-11-09

In fact, unless you read elsewhere about his life you won't realize how much he understates his own accomplishments while he honors other spiritual seekers and teachers he encounters.<br />His stories of encounters with amazing saints of all regions and religions are spell-binding, and you may find yourself (like me) devouring the whole book on your first read -- just reveling in the wonders of these true spiritual seekers.  On successive readings I delved deeper into the equally fascinating footnotes, learning about the exotic realms of Indian spirituality and its unexpected parallels with the original Christian teachings of Christ, St. John, and St. Paul.<br />In fact, the countless strata of insights and implications that surface with repeated readings of Autobiography of a Yogi argue for spending a few more dollars on the trade paperback rather than the mass market paperback edition, since you'll want to return numerous times over the years.  The Self-Realization Fellowship editions are to be preferred over others.  Yogananda himself started that organization (SRF), and the award-winning quality of SRF editing and printing shines through them - in contrast to bootlegged editions printed up by renegade outfits.<br />In all my reading in spirituality, yoga, and comparative religion, I have  discovered no work that so completely fulfills Carl Jung's prophecy that yoga science (the whole science, not just the athletic postures) will offer you ''undreamed-of possibilities'' as Yogananda's autobiography.  As the author explains, 'yoga'  comes from the root meaning 'union' - and he reveals, ever more deeply, the underlying oneness of Christianity and yoga, of spiritual truth and scientific truth, of the worldly and the spirituality.  It will deepen anyone's own faith and sensibility -- of whatever religion (or none), of the science of matter... or mind... or Spirit.atter... or mind... or Spirit.	2002-11-08

More significantly, it has blessed us with a thorough exploration of the poetic process to which Shakespeare dedicated his passion and genius -- an exploration by a foremost scholar of poetry, an extremely respectful reader of these intimate versifications, and a scholar-student who has been immersed in The Sonnets' bounty for a lifetime.<br />As the author acknowledges, this volume is meant to be absorbed gradually over an extended time and with an edition such as Stephen Booth's thoroughly annotated version at one's side.   This is not a deficit in this work but an appropriate and practical strategy that keeps this volume a thoughtful and manageable edition to enjoy, digest, and redigest many times.  It will contribute immensely to even the most advanced student's appreciation of these works and their creator's mind.	2002-11-06

Undergraduate students may wish to begin with Katherine Duncan-Jones edition from Routledge (The Arden Shakespeare) or Burrows edition from Oxford.  Advanced students in Shakespeare or English literature who intend to continue mining this ore over the years will find Booth's edition a precious resource for their library.<br />Rather than repeat the fine points in other reviews, allow me just to caution the reader about the change in the publisher's standards of printing (beginning around 2000):  the paper gets cheap, and the binding too.  I would love to support Yale University Press in its commitment to keep this edition in print.  Unfortunately, if you are a serious enough student to value Professor Booth's work, you will be using this volume enough to need a better printing, and I need to encourage you to seek out a used copy of an earlier printing.	2002-11-06

That would require knowing the credentials of the editor, the currency of the editing, etc...The price is excellent - what the reader receives, well... caveat emptor.<br />Value to beginners:  none (no background on the plays, glosses of difficult words, etc.)<br />Value to adv. students: none .<br />Value to scholars: less than none.<br />Judge this book by its cover: not.  Attractive cover hides printed pages that appear to be facsimiles of archaic, crammed-type pages from some bygone era.<br />Perhaps you think, 'Well, at least it's a cheap way to get a copy of the complete plays.'  A few months of reading modern, respectable editions (e.g., from Routledge/Arden, Cambridge, or Oxford) for any popular Shakespeare play will help a newcomer realize that for almost all Shakespeare plays determining what is 'the text' is a vast conundrum; nay: an oxymoron. As with many aspects of Shakespeare study, 'tis not so easy:  for most plays there are multiple alternative *original sources* - differing in important ways from each other.  What sources did the editor of the Gramercy edition use?  Well, if the publisher does not deem it necessary even to credit the editor's name in this volume or to acknowledge how outdated the editorial work is...<br />A better use of your money is to buy a modern edition of single plays. Even the inexpensive Folger Library paperbacks give beginners helpful definitions for difficult words.  For those planning to dive deeply into the intricate weavings and unfathomed levels of meaning in these great works, save your money by shunning this bookcase-worthy-only printing, and seek out a complete edition such as the Arden(Routledge) with helpful annotation on difficult words or the respected Riverside edition, or (best for real literature students) David Bevington's excellently edited volume (extremely helpful overviews offered for each play). (A used copy of a Bevington edition from the 1980s is worth a truckload of these 1900ish Gramercy printings.)<br />I regret spending even these few minutes to review the most INadequate version of Shakespeare available, but am aggravated to it by the high Amazon sales ranking for this edition - which suggests that thousands of unsuspecting buyers are throwing money away.  Worse yet, once they have their copies they will be discouraged from exploring the grandeur of the plays because of this archaic, alienating, barren reprint. Most will open the book a few times, quickly put it away, and stick to Hollywood productions.<br />Ignore the respected name 'Random House' on these books and attend to the qualifier 'Value Publication' and its alias 'Gramercy Books'.

It would look so nice on your bookshelf. But if you think you might ever want to *read* any of the works of Shakespeare: don't waste your money. <BR>Inside the attractive binding you find facsimile pages (*not* re-typeset by the publisher - and very difficult to read) of some 19th edition with archaic engravings. No introductory notes. No explanatory notes on difficult words. No bibliography for further study of the plays and poems. Not even a credit to the original editor - or an acknowledgement of the *date* of the original editorial work.<BR>Utility for beginning level students: none.<BR>Utility for advanced level students: none.<BR>Utility for scholars: less than none.<BR>Utility for its publisher: excellent (I'm sure the low price regularly snares buyers who don't go to the trouble to return the ook).<BR>RECOMMENDATION: Use the ten-fifteen dollars you would have spent on this volume to 1) buy a thorough edition of a specific play (e.g., Oxford, Routledge, or Cambridge editions or Cambridge School edition for high schoolers) or 2) save toward an edition of the complete plays that is respectably (modernly) edited such as the Arden (Routledge) edition (has only notes on difficult words) or the Addison-Wesley edition by David Bevington (with thorough notes and discussions that will deepen your understanding and appreciation of the works).<BR>BUT HOW BAD CAN IT BE AT THIS PRICE?

(But a solace to those who enjoy maintaining their senses of humor about those who contend they are *the objective thinkers*.)<br />Pechter stays, if not *above* then at least remarkably non-attached to the ideological wars into which he provides insights.  For the informed outsider, his wit and insight make for an enjoyable safari into the minds (and even emotions) of those professionally involved in lit crit. and theory.  What a delight to see gibes with affection instead of venom, as when Pechter refers to Richard Levin as enjoying a &quot;richly deserved and entirely honorable reputation for stirring up trouble...&quot; or remarks on the irony of how at the end of an acrimonious conference, *everyone* seems to express a sentiment similar to Gayle Greene's &quot;If you really want to know, I feel beset from all sides.&quot;<br />Pechter's final analysis is upbeat about the possibility of actual light being shed during the heat of Theory's ideology wars.  Unfortunately, the very absence of  personal attacks and diatribes may leave his insights largely unread by the warring factions.  For students who afford to entertain a broader perspective on Critical Practice (not feeling pressed to join a 'side' in order to succeed at the academe) Pechter offers a breath of fresh (though not sanitized) air.  Enjoy!	2002-07-07
US	52273646	RM5I0CEVUQ2HT	0140193375	251739920	Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind (Compass)	Books	5	66	69	N	N	Timeless Spirituality with the Authority of Experience	Although now a century old, Dr. Bucke's volume is timeless because its topic is: the human quest for the experience of The Divine.<br />Written, not by a theologian but by an experiencer of the Ultimate Mystical Experience, this book describes Bucke's own few seconds of illumination, then goes on to show commonalities among the experiences of the ancient (Lao Tse, Buddha, Christ, Paul, Muhammad, etc.), medieval-renaissance (Dante, Shakespeare, etc.), and modern (Ramakrishna, Whitman, etc). The intellectual credentials of this neurologist cause Bucke's work to stand head-and-shoulders above popular \\"New Age\\" mystic reports.<br />Be sure not to miss Bucke's description of his own experience (humbly buried in introductory notes), and don't get bored by reading his analytical sections on the nature of consciousness. Dive into the excerpts of how writers have struggled through the ages to express their inexpressible experiences of Divine Love, Brahmic Ecstasy, Rapture... variously named in different times and cultures.<br />Although women are under-represented (naturally, since for millenia they've largely been barred from authorship), some of the most movingly personal experiences are those near the end of the volume by three 19th Century women.<br />The power of this gem stems from its first-hand reports of enlightenment - with its unpredictable, highly personal expressions. You'll find God experienced here not as an anthropomorphic Jehovah, but as a living Presence; not sterilized by intellectual analysis, but revered in Its humanity-divinity. Most helpfully, Bucke shows the parallels between different saints/illuminati/authors in their experiences and in their ways of describing it. <br />I tell my students that if they were to be sentenced to live out the rest of their lives on a desert island with only five books: Make this one of the five!	2002-02-02

She walks among the rigidities of academic 'religions', surveying their observations and insights, and bringing their value to the reader rather than requiring one join any church of literary criticism. <br />Gender is supposed to be a central focus of the volume, and it is -- but in such a way that if you belong to either gender (or read a poet who does) you've got a lot to learn here.<br />For someone like myself whose interest centers on Shakespeare, Wall's material spanning all the writers and printings of the era is nevertheless exciting for vital implications for the environment in which Shakespeare created. <br />NB: it IS available in paperback (of high quality) as well.	2002-01-03

Yes, unfortunately, if this is your first reading on the authorship question, at the end of it, truly, you won't know what to think - as some readers have said.  Since Sobran does not provide a balanced view that includes the countless DIFFERENCES between the life and writings of Oxford and the Shakespeare writings nor acknowledge the countless similarities that could be drawn between ANY Elizabethan poet and Shakespeare, you may might even be swayed to Mr. Sobran's conclusions.<br />But, fortunately, there are thoughtful presentations such as Irvin Matus' SHAKESPEARE IN FACT, and Berkeley Professor Alan Nelson's Shakespeare authorship web site.  Dr. Nelson's research has even made it possible to document rather humiliating biographical details about the Oxford Earl, alleged creator of those Shakespeare masterpieces which so subtly express the variegations of the human heart.<br />If truth as well as titillation appeals to you, be sure to read more broadly into the complexity of the issues of Shakespearean authorship than you'll be able to by scanning the narrow focus of one committed Oxfordian.  There are scores of titles to consider that are still in print, including Katherine Duncan-Jones' recent biography and Stephen Mitchell's entertaining introduction to the convoluted world of &quot;Who Wrote Shakespeare?&quot;	2001-12-08
