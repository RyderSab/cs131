I've been a dedicated fan of the Alice series for over four years now, and I'm finally older than Alice - but I know I'll always love reading about her. Including Alice is a great addition to the series, and probably the most-eagerly-awaited of them all, because guess what? Alice's dad is getting married!<br />The \\"wedding chapters\\" were so much fun to read, especially while listening to the free CD of classical wedding music that's included with the book. Obviously, there are a lot of changes for 15-year-old Alice, including getting used to having a stepmom, Lester living in an apartment of his own, and new developments in her relationships with friends. <br />I really enjoyed this book, because it included many familiar characters, realistic and humorous situations, and was very easy to relate to. Alice is definitely growing up, and Phyllis Reynolds Naylor is the best at making this series work!	2004-04-30

I've been a fan of the Alice series for over three years, now, and every year I anxiously await the next release. I was not disappointed with Patiently Alice this spring - far from it! Covering the summer between 15-year-old Alice McKinley's 9th and 10th grade years, this should be popular with fans and newcomers to the series alike. <br />Alice's mother died when she was very young, so she's excited that her dad is finally marrying her English teacher from 7th grade. Alice and three of her friends, Elizabeth, Pamela, and Gwen, decide to be assistant counselers at a summer camp for three weeks, however, soon before the wedding. Alice and her friends have a lot of fun, trials, and tribulations at camp, but when Alice returns home, so many things have changed. The wedding is postponed, her 22-year-old brother Lester is considering moving, a friend is having family problems, and she even hears from her ex-boyfriend, Patrick. <br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes very realistic, humorous reads about life for a teenage girl who is not-so-perfect but somehow relates to all of us. Be sure to read the othes in the series, and if you still want more, try The Princess Diaries series by Meg Cabot or the Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging series by Louise Rennison. Enjoy!	2003-05-16

When a friend lent me Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, I basically shrugged and thought, \\"Okay... Well, whatever, I don't have time to go to the library today.\\" After I'd flipped through it, though, I decided that it looked pretty funny, and I couldn't wait to read it when I got home. The result - I was up late muffling my laughter while I read this book!<br />Georgia is a 14-year-old modern British girl, and this book is her diary of a year in her life with all of it's (ever changing) ups and downs. Her sarcastic views are generally hilarious, and that makes this book a definite page turner. <br />I hope the sequels will be just as good, and if you're looking for another laughter-filled epic of a teenage girl, try the Alice series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor - or for other funny, diary form books, Truth or Dairy and Catherine Called Birdy.<br />For any teen/preteen girl, reluctant reader or not... Try reading one page in this book, and see if you can put it down!	2002-07-13

She writes about the work that she does on the rancho, festivals, and her friends (and the boy she loves!), and also her wonderings of who her and her little brother's parents really were - and she is determined to find out. However, with the &quot;norteamericanos&quot; taking over her homeland, and thoughts of war in the air, life soon becomes much more complicated for Rosa.<br />This was another excellent novel in the Dear America series, and I'd highly recommend it, as it was very exciting and interesting, and also taught me a lot about the Spanish culture. I'd definitely recommend this book for ages 11 - 14!	2001-04-30

(Don't ask) Smith, 17, is having plenty of problems her senior year at high school. For one thing, just before school started, her long-time boyfriend, Dave, broke up with her... and then there is Grant, who she is convinced is trailing her for Dave... and then her not so little brother starts to date someone close to her... and then Courtney decides to give up guys for her senior year! This is all not to mention all the troubles with the rest of her family, her dog who has grand-mal seizures, getting on the Student Council at school, and about everything else that could happen!<br />This book was a funny, light-hearted read that I'd recommend for all teenagers ~ be sure to also read the Alice series (The Grooming of Alice, etc.) by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor!	2001-03-18

At first the war is just an adventure to him, with rides on trains, bad camp food, and pretty girls waving at him. But after his first battle, he realizes that war truly is war - and Charley is no longer a boy. <br />This book, though only one hundred pages, was really a great Civil War novel, that showed plainly how utterly stupid and terrible war is. It was based on a true story, which really adds to it, too. I'd also recommend &quot;Rifles for Watie&quot;, by Keith, and also, &quot;The Boy's War&quot;, by Murphy, which would go well with &quot;Soldier's Heart&quot;.	2001-01-14

Ivy loves researching her family's history, because besides her lawyer ancestors, there are the different, but interesting ones - the ones &quot;stuck in the backwater&quot;. When Ivy hears about her &quot;crazy&quot; aunt Josephine, she knows she has to find her, and she starts on a journey up a mountain to meet her.<br />This was a fairly exciting, interesting book, but not my favorite for several reasons. First of all, the storyline was a pretty unrealistic - a girl leaving her family to find a long lost aunt. Also, the spelling and grammer really needed to be edited better during the making of this book! Even so, this book was an entertaining read, quite funny at times, though it wouldn't become one of my favorites.	2001-01-13

However, after her 13th birthday, her carefree life begins to change, when war breaks out with Russia. Continuing until she is almost 17, you will be amazed at the changes, generally not for the better, that take place in this teenager's life.<br />I really learned a lot about Anastasia, who lived not very long ago. The only thing I'd say against this book was that some years of her life were covered pretty briefly, but other than that, this first funny, and then serious novel was a great read! I'd definitely recommend it for ages 11 and up - I think this exciting book would appeal to a wide audience!	2001-01-13

But when her brother and boyfriend go off to war, and the war and everything with it comes dangerously near to her family, she learns John's secret, and his freedom is now in her hands...<br />This was a great, exciting novel, with everything to make a well liked story - romance, adventure, intrigue, strong characters, a historical background - anyone aged 12 and up would enjoy it, I'm sure! Be sure to also read &quot;Cast Two Shadows&quot; and &quot;The Winter of Red Snow&quot;, two other great Revolutionary War novels, and possibly also see the movie &quot;The Patriot&quot;.	2001-01-04

Times are hard, but Rob is determined that he won't give the farm up; he plants crops, tries to find odd jobs, though they are low paying during the Depression, keeps in touch with his kind girlfriend, and he also tries to continue going to school.<br />This was a great novel, on the realistic and yet inspiraional struggles of a poor Shaker boy. Recommended for anyone ages 12 and up wanting a good read, and definitely if you've read &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die&quot;.	2001-01-03

Her life begins to change drastically then; her friend, Kit, is hanged for trying to attack Cornwallis, her father is in jail for being a Patriot, her brother, who was at war, needs her to help him, Loyalists are taking over her home, her sister is getting to be friends - very good friends - with a British soldier, and she's also beginning to know her slave grandmother.<br />This book told a good story, with quite a bit of truth in it, about the interesting times of the Revolutionary War. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone ages 12 and up wanting an exciting read! I'd also recommend &quot;A Wolf by the Ears&quot; and &quot;Time Enough for Drums&quot;, two other novels by Rinaldi, and definitely the movie &quot;The Patriot&quot; as it is about some of these very places, people, and events mentioned in this book.	2001-01-02

Cooney, but not her best, as the characters weren't as realistic as usual and the ending was rather predictable. <br />Liz, 16, seems to have the ideal family for Christmas because her wealthy parents always decorate to the peak during the holidays. However, things are not completely happy at her home when Liz's older sister loses a baby, and also when Liz discovers that her parents don't really care about the meaning of Christmas.<br />16-year-old Matt, on the other hand, is a hardened foster child who is secretly happy to have new foster parents who care about his grades and his life. When his foster parents also care for an 8-year-old, Katie, he becomes attached to the little girl.<br />Matt and Liz both want Katie to have what she really wants for Christmas: a family. But hope is being lost, and time is running out. Can Katie - not to mention Matt and Liz - have their Christmas wishes come true?<br />This was a sweet, touching story, appropriate for almost all ages. It would make a good family read about the real meaning of Christmas.	2000-12-27

When I picked up &quot;Lasso the Moon&quot; at the library, I just wanted something to read - I didn't realize that this book would be *so* good!<br />&quot;Lasso the Moon&quot; tells about teenage April, living with her father, a recovering alcoholic, off the coast of Georgia. Her father is also a well known doctor who does work with foreign refugees, and through him she meets Fernando, a young El Salvadore teenager. April becomes increasingly curious about Fernando, wondering where he got the horrible scar on his neck, why he came to America, and what really happened to him in El Salvadore. <br />This was an excellent, intriguing book, with a great twist at the end. I'd highly recommend it for ages 12 and up, and I'd also definitely recommend &quot;Children of the River&quot; about a Cambodian refugee.	2000-12-27

I was certainly suprised! This book ranks very high in my favorite books.<br />Jeff Bussey, a teenage Kansas boy, decides that he wants to join the Union army, especially after southern bushwackers come near his family's home. Jeff is sure that fighting the Confederates will be a great adventure for he and his friends, but he is soon suprised - when he sees the results of terrible battles, he begins to doubt the honor and excitement of war. When Jeff falls in love with a spirited Cherokee-Confederate girl, and also when he gets involved with some other Confederates, he learns that the other armies are just made up of boys like him, who fiercly honor their country.<br />This was an excellent, exciting, interesting, and, at the same time, educational young adult novel on the Civil War, and I'd definitely recommend it for ages 12 and up! You may also enjoy &quot;The Journal of James Edmund Pease&quot;, &quot;The Boys' War&quot;, and &quot;Soldier's Heart&quot;, also on the Civil War, and, on the also intriguing Revolutionary War, the book &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; and the wonderful movie &quot;The Patriot.	2000-12-27

Manya and her 14-year-old brother, Chaim, decide to leave her family's dangerous hideout and go with her boyfriend, Meyer. Together, they go through various hiding places and worsening concentration camps all over Europe. Trying to survive day by day, they often wonder if they will ever be free again. Meyer and Manya survive, however, with their great faith and love for each other - but how? Will they ever see their families again? Can they ever be happy... and free?<br />This was a great, inspirational story, written by the couple's son. It can be read and enjoyed by a large age group, anywhere from middle schoolers, teens, and adults. It really helped me to see the true horror of the war, and I would highly recommend it!	2000-12-22

There, she begins to discover the secrets of her family: who her father was, what her grandfather was like, how her mother's life was as a girl, and why she never knew these things.<br />Throughout this book, Claire also deals with a friend sick with leukemia, family ties, and a romance with a &quot;farmboy&quot; neighbor.

Through her soon popular club she makes friends and a boyfriend, and she's very happy - but then she hears that her father was wounded. Suddenly the war isn't exciting to her anymore, and in her sadness she begins to walk along the beach every night. Then she sees something important...<br />This was a good book, though not great, for several reasons. For one thing, Maddie acted younger than her age; I would have thought she was 11 or 12. Also, not many good descriptions were included, and her so-called romance was rather dumb and unnecessary. However, this book was worth reading, as it was quite exciting at times!<br />I'd recommend this book for ages 10 and up, and I'd also recommend &quot;Behind the Bedroom Wall&quot;, another WWII book, as well as the other &quot;Dear America&quot; novels.	2000-12-12

Not to mention Karen shoplifting and Jill burying her grandmother! What? Well, it's all part of the Critical Choices unit in Alice's 8th grade class: everyone receives a hypothetical situation and solves it. <br />This book was filled with humor, especially when Alice and her friends try to solve their situations!

Marnie begins teaching him hand signs, and forms a bond with him, but then the villagers brand her a witch, and test her with the iron bar.<br />This book was wonderful, and I'd recommend it for ages 12 and up. I'd also recommend &quot;Breaking Rank&quot;, by Randall, which is another story of prejudice.	2000-10-22

However, when Devonny needs help, it seems as if Todd is the answer to her prayers...<br />I loved this book, and I think it's a great addition to the series!
