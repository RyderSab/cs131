Funny, adorable, yet touching and poignant, this wonderful whimsical piece of printed entertainment is a prime example of realistic fantasy -- combining fantasy elements with everyday occurrences.

I get SICK of people calling this a CHILDREN'S BOOK. It's so limiting. I think of this wonderful confection of a printed entertainment as a WHIMSICAL FANTASY that can be enjoyed by everyone from tiny tot to grandparent. Loved the description of Wonka's candies and the characters/settings. LOVED the factory tour and the Ooompa-Loompa chants for Charlie's naughty tourmates as they got \\"theirs.\\" Poor but kind-hearted Charlie is a true literary hero and role model.

I don't think of it as a \\"children's book,\\" but as a \\"whimsical fantasy\\" that will delight young and old -- and everyone in between.<br />  Matilda is a child genius whose parents treat her like dust on the furniture, even when she gets even for being ignored by adding bleach to her male parental unit's hair pomade and making her female parental unit think the house is haunted. She has a thirst for learning, so she goes to a school -- run by the Headmistress from Hell, who thinks everyone who's not an adult is a \\"piece of filth\\" and gets her jollies by torturing the youngsters. Spiked torture boxes! Grabbing little girls by their braids! Throwing children over the fence! Why, she even force-fed one unfortunate young fellow a WHOLE chocolate cake in front of the whole school. (I felt poor Bruce Bogtrotter's pain during the famous -- or should that be infamous -- Cake Scene) But the one she REALLY had it in for was -- you guessed right -- Matilda, who is not only a genius but has powers of telekinesis to boot!<br />  Her one adult ally is Miss honey, as sweet as her name, who shows Our Heroine what it's like to feel cared for.<br />  If i could give this book 10 stars I would! Good work, Mr. D.! This is right up there with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!	2005-08-12

Kind of wish the ending was a bit different.

This is a beautiful, comedic yet moving tale of the life, loves, family relationships, friendships, and eating patterns of a gentleman who happens to be of ample body contour. This wonderful literary entertainment reminds me of my own cuddly, generously-proportioned boyfriend, who, unfortunately, lost his life in a car crash in 2003. The hefty, handsome hero of this beautiful story, like my departed boyfriend, tried all kinds of weight-management methods, had many clashes with people due to his ample dimensions, had a woman break up with him due to his size, and met another woman, via the Internet, who adored him and thought his large looks were adorable. (just the way I felt about my boyfriend.) This lady ended up being his bride. I love the way this book focuses less on diets and eating and more on the large-sized fellow's interpersonal relationships and societal dealings. This book made me laugh, cry, and cheer. Do I recommend it? You can bet bucks to bagels I do!	2005-05-30

The Harry Potter books, featuring a schoolboy warlock, appeal to every Tom, Dick, and Carlos, though originally targeted toward the world's Tommies, Dickies, and Carlitos -- a good portion of HP fans are kids, tweens, and teens, but another good-sized portion of HP fans are adults.

Creative, entertaining, and thought-provoking	They label this a teen book, because we are a society obsessed with giving everything a label, but I recommend it for EVERYONE. Truth to tell, I probably would have turned up my nose at this book had it been around when I was a teen ('80s). Back then, my taste in reading matter ran to Judy Blume-Ellen-Conford-Bev-Cleary-Paul Zindel type stuff and the cotton-candy-sweet romances aimed at that era's teen market. (Wildfire, Sweet Dreams, all like that.) with plotlines on the order of of &quot;Cheerleader Katrina hatches all sorts of plots to get closer to handsome Carlos.&quot; Well, one won't find any Cheerleader Katrinas or Handsome Carloses here! No &quot;teacher is a buttmunch&quot; or &quot;I hate my stepfather&quot; or &quot;I hope I make the basketball team&quot; kind of stuff either. This is a portrayal of the darker side of teenhood, and of personhood in general, in a darker time than we have ever experienced. Although, with this and his earlier release BURGER WUSS, Matt Anderson may be showing signs of driving in Paul Zindel's lane.<br /><br /> FEED is at once a fantasy of a dark tomorrow and a tale of an adolescent finding his place in the human hierarchy and snagging himself a sweetheart in the process. Sort of George Orwell meets Paul Zindel. Catcher in the Rye, 2019. Judy Blume in the Twilight Zone.<br /><br /> It's a tale of a dismal near-future where people have internet linkages installed in their brains when they're tiny tots, beef grows on bushes, the air is toxic, adults talk like ninth-graders, corporate companies control everything, even the clouds are trademarked, and everyone has cake for brains, seeing as the Internet &quot;feeds&quot; implanted in people's brains tell them what to do, where to go, who to socialize with, how to look, (Skin sores as ornaments! Chilling thought!) and what they need and want, eliminating the capacity of -- and the need for -- knowledge, literacy and independent thought, rendering them shallow, stupid, product-obsessed, status-hungry, and consumeristic. But what hapopens when hackers damage your &quot;feed&quot; and you have to -- GASP! -- think for yourself? A great entertainment and mind-stimulating cautionary tale. And the chilling thing is, it may not be entirely make-believe.<br /><br /> This book will not only stimulate your mind, but also make you appreciate the fact that you have one. 5 stars. Oh, and I loved the futuristic teen-lingo -- &quot;unit&quot; and &quot;unette&quot; for &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;chick,&quot; indicating how this is a society in which people have become thingsatus-hungry, and consumeristic.

I read this book in college and this is the book that got me to like dystopian fiction, or what I like to call \\"dark tomorrow\\" fiction. The ecological conditions, the effects of the toxins, and the government's ways were brilliantly portrayed, and I felt for seventeen-year-old Arthur (the hero) and his plight. The disturbing thing is, this is a science-fiction book, but it's not a total fantasy. Look at Agent Orange, for instance. And what about Nazi Germany?<br />  Despite the fact that Arthur is seventeen, there is nothing really in here that makes it specifically a \\"teen\\" book. I think it's an entertaining and thought-provoking tale for ANYONE of any age who enjoys reading about visions of a dark tomorrow, or of any tomorrow. I think the author could have just as easily made Arthur an adult man. Good fiction is good fiction, and this is great. I recommend it highly.	2004-05-01

Opinions are like noses. Everybody has one. Many people didn't like this book, but I thought it was excellent. A sparkling entertainment that tickled the funnybone, excited the mind, and touched the heart. I think that the people who slammed this book and said it was silly and unrealistic have never been unpartnered-yet-wanting-to-be-partnered. So much fiction about people searching for love deals with a lady looking for her Dashing Caballero. How refreshing to read about partner-hunting from the GENTLEMAN'S viewpoint! One part that touched my heart was when Our Hero met a woman that he grew to ADORE, and then finds out that she thought of him as very nice social company and that's it.

To cram it into a box marked with an age group doesn't do it justice, for it has themes that are timeless and universal -- love, friendship, feeling appreciated and cared for, meaning something to someone and having them mean something to you, aging, social hierarchy.

Imagine if you will, one part Ted Bundy, one part Jeffrey Dahmer, one part Gordon Gekko, one part Norman Bates, one part Louis Winthorpe III, one part the Excitable Boy (from the Warren Zevon song of the same name), and maybe one part Holden Caulfield as an adult, and you've got the character of Patrick Bateman.<br /> Just about every Tom, Dick, and Carlos who reviewed this book objected to the detailed descriptions of attire, furnishings, restaurant dishes, and beauty aids. I, however, recognized that Ellis did this to make a point about his character.<br /> Patrick Bateman is a man whose conscience is a wasteland and whose moral landscape is a huge void. This is a guy who can describe murdering his sex partner with the same casualness as he can describe what he ate for lunch. This is a guy who is the product of a twisted society where not wearing the \\"right clothes\\" is a horror far greater than the murder of a child. Any man who can stab, insult, and mutilate a homeless man and then go order a milkshake has got to be one sick puppy indeed, and Ellis does a wonderful job of showing that.<br /> WARNING! HERE COMES A POSSIBLE SPOILER!<br /> The warpiest and most well-done scene was the sick twisted \\"restaurant date\\" scene where Patrick B. poisons his \\"sweetheart\\" (I put that word in quotes because I don't really think that someone so disturbed deserves to have or is capable of having a sweetheart)by presenting her with a box of \\"candy\\" that is in reality a chocolate-covered urinal deodorant disk placed in a Godiva box, a sly, witty commentary on our society's emphasis on a pretty package over the true substance of the product itself.<br /> But DID Patrick commit these vile acts? Or did he only fantasize about it? I say, it's up to the reader to make the call. I, as a reader, personally can't decide, but one DOES hope he was fantasizing, doesn't one?<br /> I did take off a star for the violent scenes, and I have to issue a warning -- this is NOT a book you should read while eating or before going to sleep!

I liked the BJ books too, but there's something about Jane that sets her apart from Miss Jones, and thatsomething is this: Jane is less of a whiner. Whereas BJ always whined about her figure and her job, Jane seemed at peace with both. If anything, Jane, for some cockamamie reason, reminded me of Lois Lane as portryed by Teri Hatcher in the TV show &quot;Lois and Clark&quot; in that she seemed happy with her job and appearance but wanted a partner.<br />  I felt excited for Our Heroine when it looked like she found her &quot;superhero&quot; (Doctor Timothy) and then disappointed for her when he turned out to be a super ZERO.<br />  I laughed, I cried, I felt for the main character, and I think Meissa S. created some agonizing yet amusing situations and very believeable characters, and I don't give a frog's foot what others say about this book. They can slam on it all they please, but my opinion still stands.<br />  SEE JANE DATE is the perfect read -- and an ideal gift -- for every &quot;Lois&quot; who hopes to find her &quot;Clark&quot; -- or at least get to sample &quot;Superman's&quot; &quot;CLARK Bar&quot; (wink wink nudge nudge and so on and so forth)	2002-07-04

I've been a fan of Stephen K since I was 14, and like I said, these stories are EXCELLENT!!!!! My favorites? Hard to choose, but here are some standouts.<br /> POPSY -- About a kindly old grandpa who happens to be a VAMPIRE.<br /> RAINY SEASON - B-Movie style horror with that classy Stephen K spark that makes it anything BUT B-Grade<br /> THE HOUSE ON MAPLE STREET about a family of young'uns who plan to do away with their Stepfather from Hell<br /> SORRY RIGHT NUMBER - A television play about a woman who gets a very strange phone call<br /> CHATTERY TEETH - About a novelty toy that's not as innocent as it looks.<br /> YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A HELL OF A BAND - I think I may like this one best of all. Clark and Mary are married sweethearts who stumble into a town populated with and run by departed rock stars!!!! COOL beans!!!! Wish he'd expand this one into a novel or a screenplay. It's rated G for GREAT and X for X-CELLENT!!!!<br /> I wish I could give this book 10 stars! I think I may need a new copy soon. I'm wearing mine out from re-reading it so much!	2002-05-20

LOVE the descriptions of Hannah's pathetic potential partners, from the gay guy trying to go the hetero route, to the gorgeous policeman with attention deficit disorder, to the handsome and wealthy computer engineer who sports an earring and a frosted-gold pedicure and eats bread that looks like bird food. Every woman who's been on a blind date will identify with Hannah and Feel Her Pain. And I thought the ending was satisfying and empowering. Recommended reading for unpartnered ladies everywhere!	2002-03-28

My idea of Captain Manhero (codename I use for one's desired male partner instead of Mr. Right)would be a man who enjoys ME, not some stupid chase. Which is not to say that I like to chase men either, because i don't. Why does there have to BE a chase? Why can't two people just come together in partnership? Animals in wild habitats \\"chase\\" or \\"hunt\\" or \\"pursue\\" -- FOOD! When a cheetah chases a zebra, he doesn't want to partner up with it, he wants to eat it! We're civilized, knowing, thinking, feeling human beings. Why, in the name of all that is sane and reasonable, would we want to emulate BEASTS?<br />  According to the authors, if you don't return his phone calls, only talk to him for 10 minutes, and accept weekend dates by a certain day and no later, he'll think you're an alluring prom queen with a complete and busy life full of cruises and cocktail parties and other glamorous treats, and getting the prom queen is ALWAYS tempting. PROM QUEEN? Oh, please! There are no prom queens in Grownupland! If I were a boy of 17, or maybe 22 at most, just learning about girls and dates and the world and myself and people, it might be fun to go out with the Prom Queen, but if I were a career-age adult male who wanted a loving partnership and family life with someone, my idea of Lady Enchantina (my code name for one's ideal female partner that I use instead of Ms. Right) would be the lady who's more interested in ME and what's going on in my life than in parties and pretty clothes and trips. Not that those things aren't nice, but they're not the end-all and be-all.<br />  This bulltoot about not returning phone calls and not speaking to a potential Captain Manhero for more than 10 minutes at a time -- all I can say is, give me a break! Not returning phone calls -- whether they're from Captain Manhero or your boss or your brother or king Juan Carlos of Spain -- is just plain RUDE! And the 10-minute rule says to the guy, \\"I don't respect you -- as a human being -- enough to make time or take time out of my day to talk to you for more than a certain amount of time.<br />  And \\"don't tell your partner your sorrows?\\" That's part of what a relationship is about, for crying in Manhattan! If you can't tell your partner that you lost your job or your dog ran away or your beloved Uncle Gordon has cancer, then who CAN you tell?<br />  What this is, is a book of little-girl \\"company manners\\" for grown women. Maybe when you're a little girl in banana curls and a pinafore, it's called \\"company manners,\\" but when you're a thinking, feeling, caring adult woman and you resort to these stupid little pretendy games, it's called \\"phoniness\\" and manipulation. If you obtain Captain Manhero's affections using pretense, then -- surprise, surprise! It's the PRETENSE he has fallen in love with, not you! Big treat! NOT!<br />  If you want an over-aged seventh-grader who views a woman as a pretty prop to show off to visitors and neighbors, this is the book for you. But if you want a dashing, romantic, caring \\"caballero,\\" then senorita, don't waste your dinero!<br />  I'd give this pathetic, insulting waste of paper NO stars if I could!<br />  I heard one that one of the silly, brainless, immature twits who wrote this thing had gotten a really ugly, dirty, messy divorce. If she was practicing all this bullcrap, it served her right. Maybe her hubby got SICK of all the hypocritical Stepfordian garbage and went to find himself a real human being<br />to partner up with!ime -- all I can say is, give me a break!

I cringed as Dominic (the fiance) jilted Our Heroine, cheered her on as she got a makeover, both beauty/fashion-related and personality related (she takes a class in order to grow a spine), almost cried over the sickly kitten everyone thought would die but instead got well, and cheered when Minty at last found love with Joe ...

And I just LOVED the &quot;thoughts&quot; -- the &quot;I-didn't-actually-say-that&quot; lines! I thought they were GREAT! No, this ISN'T Bridget Jones, it's different (I liked BJ too, but I don't really get all the parallels. They're two different characters, two different books, by two different authors).<br /> As a romantic with a Valentine where her heart ought to be, I didn't care too much for the ending, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, but on the whole, this is a wonderful read for unpartnered ladies -- and just about anyone else!	2002-02-25

Oh, BRIDGET JONES and similar titles are fine, but how refreshing it is to find a heroine in &quot;women's fiction&quot; who's concerned with something other than calories or the size of her hips.<br /> Patty Jane is an engaging character, an abandoned wife who pulls herself up by her bootstraps to raise her child, and the love stories are funny, sad, and charming. I recommend it highly.	2002-02-24

(I still have my copy, tucked amid the more &quot;grown-up&quot; fare)  Vicky's mom is giving her grief -- and then she gets blamed for something she didn't do! Bummer! Then, she enters this time warp, goes back to the 40s, and makes a friend who turns out to be her mom as a teen!!! EXCELLENT!! By thetime she gets back to her own time, she learns about her mom and about herself! This book is recomened to all mom's with daughters -- and everyone who is or has ever been a daughter. Imaginative, humorous, and moving, this book deserves 6 stars and it's a shame that it's out of print!!	2001-06-28

I thought it was hip, funny, and real. The depiction of Abbie's feelings for Franco was right on target and universal to a LOT of women, whether 20-year-old college co-eds, middle-aged professionals, or senior citizens. You're never too old or too young to fall for the wrong guy and get a broken heart.  I loved the character of Abbie, although I thought she was making a BIG mistake. I mean, the guy chose substances over her and neglected her, and she treated him like an IDOL?!?!? (Good thing she wised up at the end)Also, who fantasizes about marriage, babies, and a life together with a guy they first meet? Abbie obviously never heard the word ACQUAINTANCE!  Still in all, this a refreshing, humorous, poignant read, and although it has a teenage main character, this book can hold the interest of those considerably past the Clearasil-and-SAT's age group. I should have bought two copies -- I'm afraid I'm gonna wear out the first with rereading!	2001-05-08

As a 70s kid who watched the show in its HEYDAY, the era of the clumsy baker and the number painter, the period of Number Pinball, Roosevelt Franklin, and Hair Gordon, when David and Maria were sweethearts (They say.  I thought they were just very good pals), Mr. Hooper was alive, and Snuffy  was perceived as Big Bird's fantasy, I have to say this book is  excellent!!! It has enough memories to fill Cookie Monster's cookie jar,  Big Bird's nest, Oscar's trashcan, and Susan &amp; Gordon's apartment  combined. IT'S JAM PACKED WITH ENOUGH MEMORIES TO CHOKE A SNUFFLEUPAGUS! I  recommend it highly to anyone who remembers the Alligator King and the King  of 8!!!  Just one complaint about the book -- IT WAS A LITTLE TOO  SHORT!!	1999-09-13

I think it's so unfair when a young girl, whether a little girl or a teen, wants to do something and some adult says &quot;but young ladies don't do  that.&quot; So, Zan Hagen, I felt your pain. I did kinda wish the author  had given Suzanne a boyfriend, though, to show young girls that sports and  sweethearts CAN mix. But I think it's an excellent book.	1999-08-24

I'm (gasp) 31 now, (but part of me is still a teenager at heart) and I still think it's xlent. Very imaginative, great sense of fantasy, perfect mix of the  real life of a teen and pure make-believe, and a perfect mix of bright and  dark. I loved the part where Laurie's twin was playing tonsil-hockey with  Laurie's studly boyfriend, and I loved the way Laurie treated the character  of Jeff -- as a human being, not as a freak.  When I read this book as a  young'un, I did think Laurie was kind of out of her mind to choose the  disfigured Jeff as a boyfriend, rather than the gorgeous Gordon, but now  that I'm older, I kind of changed my stance on that. I guess looks aren't  as important when you're an adult as when you're 17 and can understand  Laurie choosing Jeff over Gordon.	1999-08-24

This touching book is fiction but it's not fantasy. There are thousands of real  life Martins walking around feeling like dorks because they're gifted, and  this books message is YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE A DORK. The world needs  more &quot;Martins.&quot; Clark Kent may have looked like a dork, but he  was a SUPERHERO	1999-06-23
