Terrific book from start to finish - it is kind of jumpy, but every chapter has something extraordinary to offer and you will find yourself what did you learn in history classes after all?  This is definitely a biased history (anti-King Leopold and Belgian colonization of the Congo) but one wonders what King Leopold would offer in his defense if he were allowed to make one.  Basically Leopold used the Congo as his personal cash cow, enriching himself and later Belgium while murdering or otherwise causing the deaths of millions of Congolese.  This book details how it happened, how this atrocity was exposed and what happened as an aftermath.  I was very moved by this book.<br /><br />Other books that might be read in connection with this book are \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" by Kingsolver, a historical fiction set in the Congo in the 1960s and \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Conrad, historical fiction set in the Congo during the 1890s (right during Leopold's raping and pillaging of the country).  Read and be amazed at the depths human kind will sink to to amass profits and plunder.	2005-10-03

Set in the time period of World War II, two Jewish boys from radically different homes become great friends.  Great themes - friendship, loyalty, tradition, life in general.  It's a quick read - Potok really has a way of keeping the story moving swiftly.  I learned a lot about Judaism and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Highly recommended to all readers.<br /><br />NOTE:  For part of the book, I listened to the audio version on CD - it was okay, but I felt the reader was a little too dramatic in some interpretations.  The story was good enough that I didn't want to wait to listen to it, so I got the book and finished it.	2005-08-30

The writing is fast paced and the book is a quick read (4 or 5 hours tops).  I found it a fascinating look at a totally different culture - the biker mafia culture.  It was sometimes very scary and I can't believe that William Queen last two years.  He made a great sacrifice (more than I would have asked for) to clean up the streets.  Overall, a must read.	2005-08-26

If Glover has provided anything, it is plenty of guidance in this book.  This covers everything a beginning runner could possibly think about - sportswear, motivation, running shoes, stretches, etc.  One reader complained about having too much info.  Good grief.  Skip a chapter if you don't want to learn about it.  I highly recommend this book to all budding runners.  I plan on referring to it often as I continue running.  The only nit I may have is that this books hasn't been updated in a while, so there may be new technologies out there that aren't reflected.  This is a minor problem and can be remedied with a little bit of internet research.  5 stars to the running bible.	2005-08-22

However, don't confuse this book with Glover's other book - which is more for beginning and non-competitive runners.  There is a lot of overlap between the two books, so there is not much point in buying both.

The fantasy element is kind of similar to \\"Enchantment\\" but it goes another level or two deeper and weirder.  Not that weird is bad, it's just different.  I enjoyed it - it pulled me along to the end and made me think.  I thought the African-American elements of the book were a little forced - almost as if there were parts of the book that Card just wanted to remind us \\"Remember this book is about African-Americans!\\", but it's not too distracting.  Overall I would recommend it to all Card fans, but if you haven't read much Card, there are better places to start.<br /><br />You can access the first five chapters of the book at hatrack dot com.  That preview will give you a pretty good idea of what the book is like without having to buy it.	2005-08-02

There are reportedly some inaccuracies in the book, but with every page full of historical details, and there being 1000+ pages, there are probably a few mistakes, but I have not been let down so far in my use of it.

This book follows the life of a young woman that marries an African adventurer and goes there at a fairly young age.  She winds up spending practically the rest of her life there, and provides a unique and interesting perspective on Rwanda's history.  Watching \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" gave me only a snapshot - leading me to think that Hutus were crazy blood thirsty savages going after Tutsis.  Well, many of them were, but this book gave me a little of the background as to why the Hutus are so crazy and militant.  Rwanda certainly has had a turbulent history.<br /><br />The book itself is a fascinating look at life on a flower farm in Rwanda over several decades.  Diane Fossey plays quite a role, as her gorilla camp was not far from the main character's house.  Good story overall.	2005-06-29

And it was. For a while.  After about half the book, it was so depressing I could not go on.  The miscarriages of justice, the pure volume of criminals, juries being juries and the overall sorry state of affairs in southside Chicago was just too much.  I thought the writing was sharp and interesting, but it was like watching 20 straight episodes of Law and Order, but there is never a happy ending (ok, there were a couple okay endings, but not enough to revive me).<br /><br />I think this is a must read for anyone considering either a career in criminal justice or being a criminal (though my advice to criminals is not likely to reach its audience).  It's a very interesting read for everyone, but be forewarned: it is pretty depressing.	2005-06-29

Both the victims and the priests (all these exorcisms were performed by Roman Catholic priests) performing the exorcisms are examined in pretty good detail.  It was much more real than any horror film or scary book you have ever read - because it was all real.  The accounts are gripping and the narrative will propel you to the finish.  After the 5 stories, the author offers insights into exorcism and theological underpinnings of it.  Very interesting stuff.<br /><br />Word of warning: This book is not for everyone.  There are detailed accounts of satanic rituals and experiences - only for a mature, well-grounded audience with a stomach for it.  I fancy myself a pretty tough fellow, but there were things in this book that made me cringe/flinch and almost vomit.  So be forewarned.	2005-06-26

A missionary zealot leads his family into the wilderness to reclaim the souls of misguided Congolese.  Boy are they in for a reality check.  Kingsolver really creates great characters and helps you live through them.  I listened to the unabridged audio book and really looked forward to my commute everyday to see what would happen.  Most of the book focuses on the family's experience in the Congo, but about 20% of it is post-Congo following the lives of the different daughters as they grow up.  Really makes you think.  Highly recommended for all readers.	2005-06-04

However, this book is the most readable economics book I have ever read - and entertaining too.  Such a range of topics - sumo wrestling, No Child Left Behind, drug dealing, parenting, abortion and more.  It's great stuff and written in such a way that you might actually appreciate economics if you have not hitherto been a fan.<br /><br />It is a quick read - 200+ pages written in a conversational tone - you really can't go wrong giving it a try, and you will inevitably feel smarter for having read the book.

This book starts out great - identifying the problems many workers feel in their jobs and lives.  And the DVD portions are pretty good too - though some are better than others.  But then we get to the solutions part of the book and it just kind of drifts into vague, abstract musings on how we can be better people (i.e. have integrity, listen to people, be good), that are just to broad to be helpful.  So while I found some of his charts, quotes and stories helpful, most of the book is not that great.  I would recommend the 7 Habits book or \\"Spiritual Roots of Human Relations\\" - both have much better practical applications than this book.	2005-05-23

Buzz Bissinger follows Tony LaRussa around and chronicles a 3 game series with the Cubs.  There are plenty of asides - histories of players, coaches, strategy think sessions, etc.  It really brought baseball to life for me.  For too many years I have lived through \\"fantasy\\" baseball, numbers flying at me through the internet.  That is no way to enjoy baseball.  To enjoy it through the eyes of a manager and a team that love the game - that was something very fun.<br /><br />However, if you don't like baseball, you probably will be bored silly throughout this book.  But you never know - give it a chance and you may appreciate the game a little bit more.	2005-05-18

The book focuses on his struggle with cancer and comeback to cycling.  It's really quite amazing what he did and what he keeps doing.  The story is told in a very conversational manner which is very easy to listen to (I was listening to the Audio CD).  I imagine it is a very quick read too.<br /><br />AUDIO CD WARNING - Be forewarned if you listen to the Audio CD - it is very poorly formatted.  There is only one track per CD and it will immediately start repeating as you finish the CD - so you find yourself thinking \\"Hmm, this sounds familiar\\" and then notice you have started over.

I really didn't know what to expect out of this book, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Capuzzo gives us a nice slice of life - what people were doing and thinking about in 1916.  He also gives us quite a few details on sharks - specifically the great White Shark.  I didn't realize I was so ignorant about sharks until I learned so much about them.  I will be much better prepared the next time I meet a shark. :)  The only complaint I have about the book is that Capuzzo is a little wordy - too many adjectives can slow a book down.  I appreciated the descriptions, but sometimes enough is enough.  Overall though, I would recommend for anyone looking for a good book.	2005-05-11

He gives personal accounts of helping the economies of Bolivia, Poland, India, Russia and to a limited extent China.  Most attempts at helping were successful (Russia, which had deeper and more entrenched problems, was a notable exception).  Sachs gives sound advice on what works and what doesn't in really really poor countries.  He also lays out how little it would take from America and other developed nations to make it all happen.<br /><br />The one downside is that for Sachs' plan to work, foreign governments have to be willing to cooperate.  It's kind of a Catch-22.  The US is not willing to donate large amounts of money if it is used poorly, and foreign governments aren't going to be able to spend wisely if they don't have very much. But really - we are spending hundreds of billions fighting the war in Iraq to \\"help the Iraqi people\\".  But we could help many more people much more efficiently if we just committed to do it.<br /><br />Overall, one of the most interesting economics books I have ever read (and I have read a few).	2005-05-07

I love Dilbert, so this book is a lot of fun.<br /><br />However, I will warn you - having the strips arranged by topic takes some of the humor out of it - a whole section of strips dedicated to \\"Secretaries\\" for instance, is not nearly as funny as just seeing an occasional barb.  Can you imagine Seinfeld doing his comedy routine by subject? \\"Ok, here are all my jokes about women\\", now onto \\"cookies\\" - no, it just doesn't work as well.  I prefer the straight timeline accumulations.  And you will find yourself rereading strips you have seen in other Dilbert books too.<br /><br />But overall, a fine collection - I still think it's great - it just could be better.	2005-05-02

He details numerous studies that shed light on how we make decisions, and how our subconscience influences those decisions.  A sampling of the applications covered: art, Coca-Cola v. Pepsi, Aeron office chairs, facial expressions, implicit race discrimination tests, police procedure, auditions for symphonies, top 40 radio, autism, market research, marital counseling and much more.  Gladwell writes a very readable, engaging book that will prompt many questions on how we view the world and the many things that affect us.  This book is one of the most unexpectedly interesting books that I have read this year and I would recommend it for anybody who is curious about how the mind works.	2005-05-01

Scott Peck follows up his popular best-seller with this collection of essays melded together quite well to form a coherent book.  The chapters range over a variety of topics that add to the spiritual growth theme Peck has going in his first book.  The topics that stand out in my mind after having just read the book are as follows:<br /><br />1.  How society needs to think about dying more<br /><br />2. How AA really has a good program - melding spirituality and psychology.<br /><br />3. Science and religion (or spirituality) need to find common ground together after spending years in separate spheres.<br /><br />4. The four stages of spiritual development.<br /><br />There is more there too, but these are the topics that I remember the best.  It's a very quick read and well worth your time.  But read \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" first if you haven't done so already.	2005-04-22

I'd love to have his job, which apparently is, as a \\"travel journalist\\", to take vacations and write about them.  He does do a fair amount of research too, and he shares that throughout the book.  But while this book will share some interesting tidbits about the Appalachian Trail, it is not primarily about the AT, but more about his and his buddy's trip on it.  They have some comical adventures.  They obviously aren't experienced hikers, but did seem to fare better than some people on the trail.  In any event, I would recommend this book.  It is a short read - about 225 pages, and reads very quickly.  I gained an appreciation for the AT, which I knew very little about.  I also had some laugh-out-loud moments reading this book.  In short, it is a pleasant, none-too-serious true life tale that will garner a few laughs along the way.<br /><br />I think Bill Bryson's book, \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is better than this one - as there is quite a bit more meaty information in it.  However, the two books are quite different styles.  This one is kind of a diary/travelogue, while \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is a short history of science and its characters.  Bryson doesn't play nearly as prominent a role in \\"A Short History\\".  Different books, but both quite good.	2005-04-17

Card is an experienced Sci-fi writer, and his abilities shine through in this book.  The fundamental invention that makes this book possible is a device that allows people in the future to look back at people in time.  It can't change or affect them, but it can watch them and observe them.  What a great invention!  No more crime with that tool - you know who did it every time.  Anyway, they look back and observe Christopher Columbus and his voyage.  Then, because of the condition of the future world, decide they need to change his voyage.  They are able to travel one-way through time and a few of them do so to dramatically alter the history of the world.  It's a great look at Columbus - Card has really done his research, as well as a fascinating look at what life in pre-Columbus America might have been like.  The characters, technology, and storyline are all very good.  I am very much looking forward to the next Pastwatch book.  I hope you like this one.	2005-03-29

I would probably give it a 4.5 if I could. Shadow of the Giant continues the story of Bean as he gets larger and Peter as he unites the world.  Lots of politics, religion and philosophy.  I really like the way Card has you switch to viewpoints of other people and see things through their eyes.  He also doesn't let the book get bogged down.  However, this does lead to a seemingly quick resolution to a major conflict.<br /><br />Card also leaves the door open for some future novels (I don't really know if he plans to write anymore on this story line).  He does kind of tie this book to the Ender's series though, so any future novels would have to stay within their own sphere.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable read that will keep you guessing.  If you liked the previous Shadow books, you will probably like this one.  If you are tired of Ender books, then you will probably not like this one. Enjoy!	2005-03-28

I'm not sure how much of it is true - it is hard to back up all these stories when many of the characters are now dead.  But it tells a story that it so compelling and lines up with so many facts that it is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Perkins travels to Ecuador, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Panama and more exotic locales, all as an economic \\"hit man\\", which is really an economist/businessman trying to sell his product.  His observations and experiences are quite unique and offer an inside look at what is really going on.  At the very least, this book will make you appreciate international news and modern history a little more.  It also helped me to understand why the US doesn't have a very good reputation abroad.<br /><br />It is a quick read - 225 pages, and while the story kind of jumps around a lot, it does keep you hooked and will cause you to ask a few questions about US foreign policy.  Well worth your time.	2005-03-21

Flawed in some respects, but overall a worthwhile read.<br /><br />The premise:  Starting with $1000 and not much else, Barbara Ehrenreich moves to random places and starts afresh.  As waiter, maid and Walmart employee, she sees what life is like at the bottom of the US economic labor market.<br /><br />The flaws: 1. There are of course a million ways she could have done this experiment, but I think a major mistake was to rule out living with roommates.  I've never not had a roommate, and cutting rent and other expenses in half is surely key to \\"getting by in America\\".  Her insistance on living by herself was an idea stuck in her mind from her upper class upbringing.<br /><br />2. The experiment was not very long (a few months in each place).  Of course it is hard to get by when you are just starting a job, but you have to work more than a few months to move up the pay scale and get into a system.  Granted, you can't make your whole life this experiment (life is too short) but I think she drew some erroneous conclusions based on her short stays.<br /><br />3. She didn't really spend a lot of time looking for the best job.  There was a point where she was close to getting a job at Lowe's and Walmart, but inexplicably chose Walmart, whose pay was $3 less an hour.  That seemed odd.<br /><br />The good:  It was a good look at what the bottom of the labor market looks like.  I appreciated many of the insights and observations.  It's a quick read and worth it.	2005-03-18

They seemed too nebulous - \\"Voting Rights\\" or \\"Racism and the Law\\".  But now I wish I had taken his classes.  Very few people, and extremely rare for a US Senator, have the kind of upbringing Mr. Obama had.  Hawaii, Indonesia, back to Hawaii, LA, NY, Chicago, Kenya.  The people of these places play different roles and shape Senator Obama's thinking on poverty, racism, blacks in America and so forth.  While this book was written after his stint at law school, he doesn't write about law school.  I would be very interested to read about his experience in law school, his adventures as a lawyer and state senator in Illinois and his life as a US Senator.  But I will have to wait a few more years for that book.<br /><br />Overall - read this book - it is an inspiration to humanity and a step to learning about one of the most important political figures in the 21st century (or so I predict).	2005-03-05

We enjoyed this audio book very much.<br /><br />Here is a story of a father whose wife has passed away and whose daughter is bringing home a boy from college.  Well, Dad is a little bit hesitant to lose his daughter, and hijinx ensue.  It is a pleasant, unassuming story that will make you laugh and nod appreciatively.  It was a nice way to pass the time.	2005-02-28

We loved it and made it through the books many times.  Later, I went back and read them and was blown away by how deep they are.  Kids will love the books for the story, but adults will also enjoy the religious symbolism in the book. I guess that is why my Dad could stand to read it to us night after night.  These books are fantastic - every one of them has its great moments.<br /><br />Also, if you like these, you might also look at Lewis's lesser-known space trilogy (\\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"Perelandra\\" and \\"That Hideous Strength\\").  These don't get nearly the acclaim that the Narnia books do, but are very good in their own right.  The three books are kind of a progression, but don't need to be read in order.  Also, the first book is science fiction, the second fantasy and the third a mix of sci-fi, fantasy and horror.  If you only read one of the three, read \\"Perelandra\\".	2005-02-22

A lot of these reviews do look like book reports don't they?  This book is hard to appreciate in high school.  It has many layers and really stretches the reader (which is why they want you to read it in high school - to stretch).  Anyway, I will add my two cents to the 1000+ reviews already here.<br /><br />This book paints a dark picture of the future (even though 1984 is past us, it still paints our future) as we go torward more government control and intervention.  The book forces us to ask serious questions - how far are we willing to go?  What role does freedom play?  What does freedom mean?  Orwell's masterpiece - though Animal Farm is also a good one.	2005-02-22

It divides the sections up nicely as to what you are looking for and suggests activities/event/eateries.

This book's author shares the same philosophy/company with Terry Warner's \\"Bonds That Make us Free\\" and the Arbinger Institute's \\"Leadership and Self-deception\\".  They are basically all the same story/philosophy, told from different angles.<br /><br />Bonds That Make Us Free was a general overview from a philosophical/psychological standpoint.  It was not religious and provided many short stories on how different behaviors/attitudes affected your relationships.<br /><br />Leadership and Self-deception is a story of one man (much like the Peacegiver) who is trying to understand the concept told in a business setting - he is starting a new job.<br /><br />The Peacemaker is the story of one man in a religious setting.  His deceased grandfather helps him understand (through a vision/dream) how he can be a better husband/person through the use of scripture stories and focusing on the atonement of Christ.  Very good use of scripture stories and examples.<br /><br />I have read all three and probably enjoyed Warner's book the most, but The Peacemaker is a very good read and well worth your time.	2005-02-22

It is a wonderful book full of stories and examples that will help you understand how you can be a better person.  Some related books that are produced by people or companies associated with Terry Warner:<br /><br />1.

Leadership and Self-Deception by the Arbinger Institute:  Same story format as the Peacemaker but from a business perspective.<br /><br />All are great reads, but Bonds That Make Us Free is the masterpiece.<br /><br />Other books that have changed my life:<br /><br />The Road Less Traveled by M.

M. Scott Peck has taken years of psychotherapy experience and given us a masterpiece.  You will learn how to alter your thinking and mindset and be a better person.  It will give you new light into psychological problems of others.  I have gone on to read most of Peck's works, and they are all very good, but this is still probably the best out of all of them.<br /><br />If you like this, try \\"People of the Lie\\", or the sequel to this book, \\"Further along the Road Less Traveled\\".	2005-02-22

It is a very detailed book and contains little mini-histories on each town in and around Houston.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by how much is in here - it is sometimes tricky to figure out what is worth going to.  I have supplemented this book with \\"147 Fun Things to do in Houston\\" which is much more user friendly.  I find a fun thing to do in the 147 book, then I look in this book for other fun stuff that might be close to the real attraction.  It is also handy to have a guide for nearby eateries.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very handy book and if you really want to get to know Houston and surrounding areas well, this book will really help.	2005-02-22

Usually I like fiction because fiction often moves a little bit faster.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed Chernow's Alexander Hamilton.  The reader is top-notch and the abridgement is excellent.  Alexander Hamilton was everywhere in the early republic.  I can't believe how little I knew about him (from high school history) since he was everywhere.<br /><br />This book does a good job of showing the strengths and weaknesses of Hamilton.  He's brilliant, but he's impulsive and this often led to bad judgments.  He and Washington were a great team - Washington leaning on his intellect and Hamilton leaning on Washington's judgment.  When they are apart, Hamilton does not fair as well.<br /><br />One thing that may have been done better (and perhaps it was in the unabridged version) was that Jefferson came off as a pretty big jerk.  It could just be that most of Jefferson's interactions with Hamilton were hostile, so of course Jefferson looks bad, since all we see of him is when he is angry.  And Burr also comes off quite badly.  However, I am unsure about how much Burr has to redeem himself by.  I know Jefferson was quite accomplished, but Burr minus Hamilton might not have been anyone to emulate.  Anyway - a must read for any student of American History.  Great story.	2005-02-21

Books	3	25	25	N	N	A mixed bag	This is an average book - doesn't take too long to read and you probably will never read it twice.  I am amazed that it has been on the bestseller list this long, but the book does have some good points.<br /><br />Kiyoasaki basically stresses that while hard work does make money, investments make more money.  You can waste your life away working for an employer who will capture most of your value added, or you can invest in real estate or whatever and make money just sitting there.<br /><br />This main thesis leads to more ideas: college is not the best path for everyone, negotiation is key, etc.  But 90% of the book just emphasizes over and over the above point.  I found it enlightening but a bit repetitive.<br /><br />I think Kiyosaki downplays the risks to investments though - you could lose everything, whereas working for an employer the most you can lose is your current income stream.  Also, if everyone subscribed to this theory, a huge real estate or stock bubble would emerge. I think it is safe to say that not everyone is jumping aboard, but with or without his book, bubbles do develop in investing and you could get creamed (anyone remember real estate in California during the 80s?).  I think he does talk about stock bubbles in another book, but seeing as he has about 20 books out now, I wasn't about to go read all of them.  What he needs to do is condense them all into one and then you might have a solid read with a real thicket of information.  As it is, I think the book has one really good idea that is repeated over and over.  So buy it if you feel my explanation hasn't been thorough enough, but there isn't that much more there.	2005-02-21

McPherson does a great job of putting it all into one volume (albeit it a long volume).  There are a few chapters on the build-up to the Civil War covering numerous presidencies and conflicts.  Once the war kicks off, McPherson will spend one or two chapters on military battles and then a chapter on other aspects of the war (e.g. the South trying to outrun the embargo or the North's recruiting problems, etc.).  It took me a while to read it, but I was very satisfied.  I feel like I know the basics of the Civil War and that this book is a great starting point for anyone's journey into the war that defined America.<br /><br />Also, if you're not up for a long book, see Ken Burns' \\"Civil War\\" series on video or DVD.  It's amazing.	2005-02-21

This book is far and away the most readable of all Nibley's works and could be the most gripping non-fiction book I have ever read.<br /><br />The basic thrust of the book is that people today (Mormons not exempt) are focused on making money, and this has led to the ignoring of more important things.  Nibley has great talks on The Law of Consecration, Spiritual Gifts, and working at the right things.  It is fair to say that this book has been one of the most influential of my life (I have read it several times over since first reading it 3 years ago).	2005-02-18

At the very least, it would be a handy supplement.<br /><br />Bryson's book is full of fascinating stories about scientists and other people connected with science through the ages.  I usually sell all my books back (or get them from the library), but this one is a keeper.  Not only do I anticipate myself reading this again, but I will give it to my kids when they are old enough to appreciate it.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this book is that the title is slightly misleading: A Short History of Nearly Everything it is not.  It is a Short History of Nearly Everything Science-related.  I actually bought this book without knowing too much about it and I opened it thinking I would be reading about politics, economics, military conquests and so forth.  Well, there are politics, economics and conquests, but they are all related to science and the history and development of science.  Fabulous book - it is no wonder it has stayed on the bestseller list this long.	2005-02-18

Bios can be hard to write (or read) because covering a whole life is not easy to do.  I think Boyd Petersen does a great job here.  Every other chapter is devoted to teachings of Hugh Nibley.  This provides a great balance to the story since teachings make up such a big part of Hugh Nibley's life.  Hugh Nibley has lived a most fascinating life.  I would rank this right up there with great biographies of the prophets (such as Ezra T. Benson, Gordon B. Hinckley and Spencer W. Kimball).  I can't quite get through all of Nibley's most scholarly work, but I appreciate much of what he has given to the LDS community, the best book being \\"Approaching Zion\\".  Read the biography - and if you read any book of Hugh Nibley's, read \\"Approaching Zion\\".	2005-02-18

Lewis has taken this difficult subject (\\"How the Devil works\\") and put it in a format that everyone can read and enjoy.  Well, some people may not enjoy it, but you can't help but learn from it.  This is one of the few books that I can read over and over again (partly because it is pretty short, but mostly because it is so thought-provoking).  If you liked this one, I might also suggest Lewis's space trilogy (\\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"Perelandra\\", \\"That Hideous Strength\\") - which are very good, but not so well known.

This book is no exception.  This book was quite a bit different though.  It is not in OSC's usual genre of Sci-fi or Fantasy.  Nevertheless, I had no trouble finding myself deeply immersed in this family's problems.  I could relate 100% as a father and employee.  Very well written and will keep you entertained to the end.<br /><br />I particularly the intra-ward wrangling.

It is an escape from everyday life.  The Broker is no exception.  You will probably not learn anything real about spies or high tech gadgetry (read Tom Clancy for that), you will probably learn something about Italy, but most importantly, if you let yourself you can be caught up in another exciting ride.<br /><br />Grisham's novels are a bit formulaic, though some have strayed from the formula.  The formula here: lawyer (with love interest) in trouble must escape while life is in danger - is a tried and true, and works very well in this novel.  I enjoyed it, but have had my fill of Grisham for a while.	2005-02-17
