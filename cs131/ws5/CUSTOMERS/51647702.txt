Peter Matthiessen covers all the bases.  His depth of coverage is astounding.  Everytime I had a question about a person or event, they were answered somewhere in the book.  It is an amazing telling of what are truly frightening events in our history.  It creates a desire to learn more and more, not just about what happened to the Lakota people, but about our government.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!  The fact that it took so long to be published speaks volumes about the content.	2001-07-09

I often harbor the fantasy of taking off, no plans, no real goals, just the American expanse to explore.  I think it takes a lot of courage to actually do it. Heat-Moon's story is beautiful.  It is simple and real.  He shares his feelings as his journey progresses.  He also meets some real characters!  I think every person is unique and eccentric in there own way and Heat-Moon recreates these people extremely well.  If you are a closet wanderer... read this book, it will not disappoint you.	2001-05-02

In the beginning paragraph it says, &quot;We are still making history.&quot; as Crow Dog explains his family roots.  That sentence sums up the book for me.  It is history.  The history that is learned and not lost by Crow Dog.  The ceremonies and native ways that he is trying to maintain and to pass on are intricately described.  I don't think I have read a book that is so visually written.  I could picture the things he described. I savored this book for a few months, letting each chapter sink in.  Although the book is written in a simple manner there is nothing simple about the information shared.  A great read!	2001-02-06

It took a a few chapters for me to get adjusted to Nasdijj's style of writting.  It is sort of choppy which eventually lends itself to his story.  This is not a continuous flowing novel, but a series of stories about his life and the life of his son.  This is a heartfelt, obviously true and honest account of the life experiences of Nasdijj.  He writes like a poet, not a novelist and the results are beautiful.  As I read along I would come across sentences I would have to stop and think about, just roll them around in my brain for a while to admire how much could be said in just a few words.	2001-01-19

I had not seen the book in real life but I was not disappointed.  The photographs are stunning.  They are all black and white and bring an erie reality to how I pictured a lot of the places shown.  I have been reading a lot of Native American history and it is nice to have photos of a lot of the places I have read about.  The narratives are well written, although a little general in nature. Overall - a good coffee-table type book.	2001-01-05

The story unfolds like a rich tapestry held together with the love and tears of a family from the bible.  The story is told from the perspective of Dinah, Jacob and Leah's son.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tale of her life and how life was for women.  Anita Diamant creates a vivid picture that has lingered in my mind. <br />This was an excellent read and I have recommended it to many of my friends.	2000-10-11

Russell Means has written a most fascinating account of his life.  It was hard for me to relate to in a lot of instances, being a white woman who does not know her heritage.  I was struck through out the book by Mr. Means &quot;connectedness&quot; to his people and to the land.  I was in emotional awe of these feelings.  At times, I had to remind myself not to take some of his feelings toward whites personally, but to remind myself of where he comes from and that his statements are the truth he has lived with.  <br />This book was a great read.  Mr Means life has certainly been full.  He has had hard times and has learned from them.  He has had good times and learned from them too.  Above all else, I came away with a totally different perspective of the Russell Means I had read about in other books and in the media.  He is a human, just like the rest of us.	2000-10-05

This book has a lot of ideas for decorating your house.  The majority of the items are &quot;country&quot; style wood cutouts.  They are cute but not what I thought would be in a book that is called &quot;Haunt you house for Halloween&quot;!  The directions are thorough and easy to follow.  The book has a lot of photographs of the actual finishes projects as well. The ideas are probably good for houses with little children who may scare easy or for people who like the painted wood decorations.	2000-10-04

I am finding this review hard to write.  There are so many levels to this novel and it covers such a long stretch of time... <br />I enjoyed the struggle of faith that is dealt with throughout the book.  Mr. Irving makes a lot of good points about what it is that makes us believe (or not believe) in God.  His characters are very believable and well rounded.  They grow, they move on.<br />I just can't express what a moving novel this is.  I would highly recommend it and enjoyed it thoroughly but there is too much to share and too much I wouldn't want to give away.  I have read three other Irving novels and this is by far my favorite.	2000-09-20

It gave me a feeling of  distance from the characters.  After a while I didn't notice that so much  because I was wrapped into the story line.  This is a really enjoyable book  dealing with community and family.  The humanity of the characters is  genuine and real.  None of them are perfect but they are all believable  studies of human nature.  I would recommend this book to others, although  some might find it lacking in action.  It is a slow moving, small town  story that I found interesting and gentle.	2000-08-30

Mary Crow Dog writes like a person  would speak and the result is an open, honest account of her life, growing  up a Lakota Woman.  She speaks of the events she experienced and the  poverty she grew up in without self-pity.   She shares a wisdom that only  she could have, gleaned from her life, in each of it's stages as a child, a  revolutionary, a mother and a wife to a powerful medicine man. She depicts  the life of the Sioux woman in a simple way explaining the importance of  their role.  This was such an interesting book!  I especially enjoyed  reading the details of the Sun Dances in the book.  That is a religious  ritual that really intrigues me and I relished every detail.	2000-08-25

Although I enjoyed reading this novel, I was amazed at how self centered everyone seemed to me.  It was interesting that Howard and Alice were a  family at all.  Their family felt like a boat with no captain, driftng,  with no one wanting to be the responsible party.  I was captivated by the  story line and felt the novel was well written but it left me with  questions...  Why was Emma so angry all the time?  Why couldn't Alice, an  otherwise strong character pull herself together for her own children?  I  had other questions but don't want to give anything away!<br />I am glad I  read this book and would recommend it to others.  There are many levels to  the story and several story lines to follow, all of which are interesting  and well portrayed.  Although I didn't really have empathy for any of the  main characters I was interested in the outcome of the novel.  I think  above all else it shows that grief is a strange animal and every person  deals with it differently.  Every person survives in their own way.	2000-08-17

I felt that the story wasn't &quot;told&quot; so much as it was  unfolded.  I enjoyed reading a story set in contemporary China.  The  contrasts between the village and the city were interesting and told in  enough detail to really give you a feeling for how life would be.  Plus the  information about traditions that were still being upheld and others that  had been let go was fascinating.  Overall I felt this was a relaxing,  pleasurable read.	2000-08-12

The final chapter left me feeling a little hopeless  and heart broken for Pecola.  The ending was unexpected and I felt it made  it worth reading.  I felt some of the book was a little disjointed.  I got  confused about the point of a few characters.  I loved Ms. Morrison's use  of descriptive terms.  Many phrases are like poetry.  Overall, a very  enjoyable but sad read.  I would recommend to others.	2000-08-08

It took a chapter or two for  me to get really taken in by the book.  Once Ruth was the central character  I was hooked.  She is tough and soft all at once.  She had complexity that  was believable and endearing.  I felt the end was a little contrived.  It  felt very convenient or something I can't fully explain.  I just felt it  could have ended in a more interesting way.  Otherwise, a great read with  lots of warmth.	2000-08-02

I always wondered how the Native Americans ended up on reservations.  Why did they give up there land?  Why didn't they just live peacefully with the whites?  Why did they end up on the worst land in the nation?<br />This book  answers all those questions and more.  I am saddened by the amount of  treachery involved in the treaties with the Indian tribes.  I had never  heard an account told from the tribe's perspective before and wow!  Is it  ever different from the history taught in school!<br />This book is a hard,  emotional read and worth every second.  I also greatly enjoyed the pictures  of the Chiefs and others involved.  There are some truly beautiful  portraits.  I would say if you only read one book about the settling of  America read this one.	2000-07-31

Harley stayed with me, I wanted  to understand him, his outward self so conflicted with his thoughts.  I am  usually pretty good at predicting the end of a book but I did not predict  this one.  The scenerios I came up with in my head were no where close to  where Ms. O'Dell took the story.  The book was a little disturbing and I  felt that Callie's motivations could have been explored more, but  otherwise, this book was a great read.	2000-07-10

He does an excellent job of painting the feelings of incarceration. I don't  believe the questions surrounding his life will ever be answered fully.  I  would recommend this book to anyone interested in the AIM organization  because I think he sums up the commitment that these native americans have  to their people.  The largest thought I came away from this book with was  that Mr Peltier is willing to give his life to his people and not many can  say that.	2000-07-10

I knew nothing about any of the events depicted in this book. They had been referenced in some other readings I had completed so I was seeking out more information.  I felt this book was a great synopsis of the events of  the Indian rights movement of the 60's and 70's.  I was disappointed in the  lack of information on Leonard Peltier and his situation.  I wanted the  book to continue for a few more years!  I think it is sad that the general  public has forgotten, so quickly, what occurred during this time.  I was  born in 1965 and I think once this movement was waning from the media, it  was quickly forgotten by the majority of Americans, which is sad.  I would  recommend this book to anyone searching to understand the plight of the  Native Americans today and the history of their search for freedom and the  right to exist as they choose.	2000-06-29

I spent a lot  of time reading this book aloud to my husband because I wanted somebody to discuss it with.  I also sent it to my  father-in-law.  It really created a lot of interest in Native American  issues for me.  I have since researched some of the issues that Mr Frazier  touched on. <br />If I had to say something negative, I would say that there  should have been more information!  I made a lot of notes about places and  events that I wanted to know more about. <br />Overall, I loved it and am  planning to read it again.	2000-06-15

It followed the life of a young Appalachian girl at the turn of the century. I thought the descriptions in this book were very in-depth and engrossing.  Julie, the main character, is a study  in strength of mind and body.  She is able to do what needs to be done  simple because there is no one else to do it.  She cares for herself and  others in a fascinating, no-nonsense manner that is very engrossing.   Although, it is a book without alot of happiness, it is a study of life and  survival.	2000-06-15
