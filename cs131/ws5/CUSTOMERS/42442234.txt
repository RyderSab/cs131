There are several helpful hints and tips in this book, but I think this book would be best if read in conjunction with other manga how-to books and plenty of actual manga.  The book's various sections are: the basics (things like heads, profiles, hairstyles, bodies, etc.), poses, bishies, the magical girl style, other popular shoujo styles, cool clothes, and design details.   <br /> <br />These sections sound great, but everthing is covered VERY briefly - the step-by-step instructions are very short and would probably be, at best, only marginally helpful for beginners.  The best part about this book is the artwork, although, as one reviewer wrote, even that has its issues.  Much of the artwork, although nicely colored, does not really look that good - it's nice, however, that the artwork varies in style, so that it doesn't appear that all manga art looks the same.  Still, I think this book would've benefitted from using examples from actual manga and discussing how those examples reinforce the book's hints and tips.  At the very least, \\"further reading\\" lists at the ends of each section might have been nice. <br /> <br />As with many how-to art books, this book seems to assume that its readers have some previous drawing knowledge, so I wouldn't recommend this book for absolute beginners, but if you've tried to draw manga characters and have been having problems, this book might help you out.  Or it might not.  While it covers quite a few drawing hints and tips, some of which I, for instance, found very helpful, there is an aweful lot it doesn't cover.  If you can afford it, it might be good to get this book along with other \\"how to draw manga\\" (or even \\"how to draw\\") books, but if you can't, you might want to look for a more thorough book.	2005-04-18

He's got an easy-going friend named Hoop, and an artist sister named Deena, both of whom hate his girlfriend.  He's also got a cat named Maggie who is hopelessly in love with him.  Maggie convinces Old Tom to change her into a human, at which time she knows Nicholas will declare his love for her in return and they will live happily ever after.  The conditions of Maggie's transformation are this: she can only be human at night, she cannot tell Nicholas what she is, and Nicholas must tell her \\"I love you\\" before All Hallow's Eve.  Of course, Nicholas does not tell Maggie he loves her the first time he sees her (naked on his doorstep), but he eventually finds himself entranced with the playful, beautiful, and mysterious Maggie. <br /> <br />This book is really pretty cute, and there are many scenes that'll make cat-lovers smile.  Maggie's complete and utter adoration of Nicholas can get a little old after a while, however.  While I was reading, I also thought of a lot of questions which, if I had really been drawn into the story, would probably not have occurred to me until later.  For instance, how could everyone so easily accept every strange thing Maggie does without wondering about her more than they do?  Nicholas just accepts that Maggie is completely gone during the day, without anyone ever seeing her go on the walks she is supposedly going on.  As confused and naive as she can be, you'd think there would've been more worrying about her possibly getting hurt.  At any rate, while this is not an excellent book, it is good for a quick, sweet read.  Also, for those of you who are more interested in romantic tension than copious amounts of sex, this may be the book for you, since there is really only one sex scene and it's fairly vague.	2005-01-02

Alice is a shy girl who can never seem to say what she feels and gets picked on a lot.  Everyone thinks her sister is perfect, and, to make matters worse, Alice has a huge crush on her sister's boyfriend, Kyo.  Alice's pent-up anger at her sister results in her sister's disappearance.  Also, Alice discovers she has amazing abilities. <br /> <br />This series is tons of fun, and I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who can sympathize with Alice.  I know I, for one, have times when I wish I could just make myself say what I feel.  I actually find myself liking Alice more than some of Watase's previous female protagonists, such as Miaka of Fushigi Yuugi.  Alice seems very realistic, sort of the quiet girl that no one ever really notices.  As usual, Watase is in top form when it comes to men.  Kyo looks gorgeous and is Alice's knight in shining armor, even if he's hopeless at figuring out how to tell people how he feels (sound familiar? &lt;g>).  I'm definitely looking forward to reading more of this series.	2005-01-02
US	42442234	R31VQJJ5WOSMER	1591823404	987227523	Gravitation, Vol. 8	Books	5	5	5	N	N	I love it!	This is actually the first Gravitation book I've read, but I've seen all the anime.  First off, the anime and the manga are not really the same thing - the premise is the same, but the plots have several differences (none of the events in this book are in the anime) and even the personalities of some of the characters don't always seem to match up (is it just me, or does Eiri seem sweeter in the manga? &lt;g>).  In this book, everything seems right in Shuichi's world - his record hits Platinum and his relationship with Eiri is actually going pretty well.  Unfortunately, Shuichi's boss, Tohma Seguchi, ruins it all by telling Shuichi to choose between Eiri or his band.  Shuichi becomes convinced that Eiri is in love with Tohma.  In this book, Shuichi is also, er, brought to America.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed Shuichi, even though he seems a little more flighty in the manga than he was in the anime, but I have to say that I'm a big Eiri fan.  There are a few absolutely adorable Eiri scenes in this book, my favorites being the ones with the print club stickers - if Eiri could just bring himself tell Shuichi what he's thinking when he looks at the sticker, their relationsip would be a lot less rocky.  Then again, Shuichi would also be annoyingly mushy all the time.  Anyway, I not only love the story, I love the artwork as well.  There are both gorgeous guys and pretty girls, something for everyone!  :)  I highly recommend this volume, although it would probably be a good idea either to have read earlier volumes or seen the anime, so that you know about Eiri's past and how his relationship with Shuichi usually functions.  Also, a quick note, if gay relationships disgust you, this is probably not the manga for you.  I've heard others say that even people who don't approve of such relationships would find themselves liking this series, but, after reading some reviews of other manga series with same sex relationships, I'm not so sure.	2005-01-02

The strip revolves around Rob, the obligatory human owner, Bucky, the neurotic and difficult cat, and Satchel, the sweet, naive, and much picked-on dog.  I love reading this strip in the funnies.  It's good in this book collections, as well, but it doesn't always flow well in book form.  For one thing, when it's collected in a book like this, it's much easier to see where Conley decides to just quit some plots and start new ones, without much warning.  I never really noticed it when I was reading it in the newspaper, but it's a little jarring in the book.  However, it's still a fun read, and not that expensive.	2005-01-02

Alice also has to deal with the ugly emotions of her mother and a classmate who liked to bully her.  For those of you who like Kyo, there's also more about his past and the reasons why he acts the way he does, keeping others at a distance.   <br /> <br />I'm really loving this series.  I love the concept of the Lotis Words.  This is also a great series for bishounen lovers - Kyo and Frey are just gorgeous... &lt;g> I know, I know, enough with the fan-girl-ness, but they really are gorgeous.  Frey makes me laugh, too.  Sometimes he's really serious, and other times, maybe even the next panel, he's being totally goofy.  He's also a bit of a lady's man and is more touchie feelie than Kyo.  This is an excellent series that I would recommend to anyone who likes romantic manga with a heavy dollop of fantasy.  If you've read Watase's other works and enjoyed them, you can't go wrong with this series.	2005-01-02

Rose's tutor is Paul Duong, who's at first reluctant to help Rose with her Vietnamese culture crash course, since he's not too sure she's serious about actually learning.  As Rose tries to learn what she can in time for her \\"test,\\" she and Paul become closer. <br /> <br />In Katherine Greyle's \\"Dragon for Dinner,\\" Chinese American Su-Ling Chen is determined to rebel against her family.  She does just that when she gets a perfect stranger, a motorcycle-riding bad boy (she thinks), to pretend to be her obnoxious American date.  It doesn't take long for that plan to go awry, especially when it's discovered that her \\"date\\" is also her neice's teacher. <br /> <br />In Saveeha Johnson's \\"The Spice Bazaar,\\" Nalini agrees to meet a man a match-maker picked out for her.  It's love at first sight, but not everything is as it seems.  The man she meets is not, in fact, Dilip, the man the match-maker chose for her, but his friend Lokesh.  He's so entranced by Nalini that he can't bring himself to tell her the truth, but he can't hide his identity forever.   <br /> <br />In Karen Harbaugh's \\"Love.com,\\" Amy Miyazaki tries to avoid her mother's match-making attempts (the woman's been nicknamed the Blind Date Empress) by accepting a web-designing job.  Amy had no idea she'd end up falling for her new boss, however.  Things seem perfect, until it's revealed that Amy's grandmother may have been instrumental in pushing the two of them together. <br /> <br />I haven't actually read all that many romance novels or stories with Asian-Americans as protagonists, other than Eileen Wilk's \\"Only Human\\" (in _Lover Beware_).  I've never read match-making stories quite like these before, so the stories were, for the most part, very refreshing reads.  However, most of the stories seemed tobe missing something, keeping them from being truly excellent, hence the four-star rating.  Paul and Rose's relationship in \\"Romancing Rose\\" actually grated a lot - the author's attempts to create tension merely made it seem like the two really didn't belong together, in spite of how it all turned out.  I couldn't help but think that there would be some serious trouble in their relationship later on.  I had some of the same problems with \\"Dragon for Dinner,\\" up until the end, which was really pretty sweet.  I enjoyed \\"The Spice Bazaar\\" the most, although the concept of actually being okay with an arranged marriage took some getting used to, for me at least.  That story requires the most \\"cultural bending\\" - the match-making of the other stories is much more familiar to me.  \\"Love.com\\" is pretty good.  My problem with it is the problem I have with most romantic short stories - love develops at a breakneck pace that I have trouble suspending my belief for.	2005-01-02

The year is 2176, and Canada has been closed off from the world by a quarantine for over a century.  The quarantine will soon be coming to an end, if nothing goes wrong.  Day Daniels is a Mounty and Lian Firebird is a plague hunter: plague hunters and Mounties traditionally don't get along.  Still, after the two are put together as partners, they can't help but be attracted to one another.  Day is invetigating the death of her previous partner, a case which overlaps with Liam's.  The killer of Day's former partner is planning on releasing a mutated strain of smallpox in Canada, resulting in many deaths and the country's continued quarantine. <br /> <br />Out of all the 2176 books, I've only read The Legend of Banzai Maguire and this one.  I have to say, I much prefer this book.  The main characters have some real chemistry, and the action is fun.  Kathleen Nance really brings this world alive.  My biggest complaint is that the story sometimes feels slow, but this is really a very good book.  The only reason I'm giving it a four is because I've read Kathleen Nance's other books, and I think she could have done better.  While Liam was really well-developed as a character, there were things about Day that I thought would get fleshed-out more that were never really touched on much.  Still, Liam is wonderful, and Day manages to have vulnerabilities and still kick butt, something that I didn't feel Susan Grant managed too well with Banzai Maguire.	2004-08-25

For a first-timer with this kind of format, this manga may be difficult to handle, since the publishers didn't put any kind of explanation of the format anywhere in the book.  Basically, this manga follows the school life of a few teachers and their students.  Just about everyone is a little strange, it seems.  There's Miss Yukari, who is somehow a teacher in spite of the fact that she's more immature than some of her students, Chiyo-chan, the ten year old genius, and Sakaki, the girl who secretly loves animals and other cute things, just to name a few.  I kept getting some of the characters confused, but I really enjoyed reading this.	2004-08-19

While the characters were occaisionally interesting, there were really too many of them introduced in such a short time for to actually get to know them.  I don't think this series has ever actually been good at allowing readers to get to know the characters, and this volume is one of the worst at this.  The artwork is still goregeous, but the series is confusing and, for me, getting boring.	2004-08-17

This volume is as beautifully drawn and sweet as the rest of the series.  It's not one of my favorite volumes, but it's still quite good.  However, as a pet rat lover, I though the one panel showing two rats politely sharing a cockroach to be amusing.	2004-08-15

Keiichi wants to revive her using one of Urd's potions, but he doesn't know which one will works, so he tries them all himself - with strange results.  Also, an old flame of Urd's comes by, and he's the extra jealous type.  Then, Keiichi has to deal with a tough bike race, a girl wants to perform an exorcism at Keiichi's place, Megumi wants to defend her softball team's right to practice, and Keiichi has to deal with a dog.  I seem to be reading a lot of sweet manga lately, but they're fun to read and can be a nice breathe of fresh air after dry nonfiction or depressing novels.  The artwork in the Oh My Goddess series is, as usual, gorgeous, and I really enjoy the character interactions and humor.  None of the main characters feel two-dimensional.  I definitely recommend this volume.	2004-08-15

Sometimes, while I'm reading this series, I am interested and excited about the events, but there are a lot of times when I'm just bored.  In this volume, Ryoko Mitsurugi and Shinsengumi have to go participate in battles at Dragon Land.  While I still think the artwork looks pretty awesome, the panels still feel overcrowded and I'm having problems caring about what happens to the characters.  In this book or any of the previous ones, there's never really all that much time devoted to allowing the readers to really get to know and care about the characters.  Instead, there are a lot of fights, which, while often fun, aren't enough, at least for me.  Judging from some of the reviews I've seen for the other volumes, however, I seem to be in the minority with my opinions about this series.	2004-08-15

His brother, Sessho-Maru has had a new sword forged that, unfortunately, has the vengeful soul of Goshinki (one of Naraku's creations) within it.  Inu Yasha's own sword has recently been repaired, but he's having problems fighting with it.  In the second half of the volume, Naraku's created another dangerous demonic being.  Even though Inu Yasha's having problems with his sword, he has to find a way to beat this demon, or Kagome may get hurt. <br /> <br />I haven't read an Inu Yasha volume that I haven't liked, so I would definitely recommend this whole series.  As for this particular volume, I would recommend it to those who are Inu Yasha fans already, although I'm guessing that those kinds of people have already read this.  This book may not be as good for newcomers to this series, unless you don't mind being a bit in the dark about some things.  The \\"story thus far\\" section basically sums up the series as a whole, but it doesn't tell you anything about what happened in the previous volume.  There is a helpful \\"characters\\" section, however.  At any rate, this volume has it all, action, fantasy, and a smidgeon of romance.	2004-08-15

While attempting to make a phone call, Keiichi accidentally calls yet another goddess hotline, adding a fourth goddess to the mix.  Peorth, the fourth goddess, is from a rival agency and therefore considers herself in competition with Belldandy and the others.  She is determined to give Keiichi his heart's desire, while Keiichi is just as determined to make sure that she won't mess things up.  Peorth has decided that the best way to help Keiichi out is to try to get him to have sex with her (it's not as raunchy as it sounds, since she never gets anywhere with him - she just spends a lot of time in skimpy clothes).  This volume has to be one of the sweetest Oh My Goddess volumes I have read so far.  I love the end of it, it's just excellent.  If you've read this series before, and you really like the whole Keiichi/Belldandy almost relationship, you'll love this volume.  If you haven't read this series before, it probably helps if you like comedy with a nice dose of romance.  There are no character or story explanations, so you may be a bit in the dark, but it seems like it's usually not that hard to figure out what's going on in the Oh My Goddess volumes.	2004-08-15

This book does have some purely rat passages, but a good portion of the book is New York history through the lens of its rats.  There were several long history sections where, although I was not bored, I forgot that the book was even supposed to be about rats.  I was also hoping for slightly better citation of the facts used - the notes section at the end of the book does mention many of the sources used for the writing of this book, but the author doesn't cite anything in any of the standardized ways.  It could be really tough to try to trace down some of his quotes or facts.  The author did provide an interesting look into the world of New York's exterminators, and I found his chapter on the plague in San Francisco to be fascinating (I think I'll be looking up more information on this).  My interest in rats stems from the fact that I own one myself, but this is not a good book to read if you are only interested in pet rats - the only rats discussed in this book are the wild urban variety, and some of the descriptions of rats being exterminated may distress owners of pet rats.  Mostly, I thought this was a very readable and interesting book that could have benefited from fewer digressions into New York history.	2004-08-15

In this volume, Mara the demon is here to cause trouble, Urd is called back by the Almighty, a ghost girl tries to hold Keiichi to a promise his grandfather made, and Hasegawa wants to learn how to make the perfect lunchbox for a special someone.  The back of this volume has a quote describing this series as \\"genuinely hear-warming\\" and I would have to agree.  Although the author/artist often deals with themes that are a bit adult (mainly sex), somehow, this series has never gotten raunchy.  It's a wonderfully sweet series, something that you can discover in practically any volume you might pick up.  This volume seemed a little weaker to me than some of the others, probably because the short story format of some of the stories didn't let the characters shine as much as they could have, but it's still an excellent read.	2004-08-15

Their time apart makes Kohaku and Shuichiro realize how much they want to be together.  This volume may be my favorite volume in this series.  I love how the characters interact, and my absolute favorite line of the series, the one that makes me laugh every time, is in this book.  I also loved the bit at the end of the volume that explains how Hisui and Kokuyo become a couple, even though it's not a very developed part.  It just happens to be very sweet.  I would recommend this volume to almost anyone, although it would probably help to have read some of the previous volumes.  However, when I started this series, I started with volume four, and I could still follow along well enough.	2004-08-09

This book focuses on Dairine, Nita's little sister.  Dairine has always wanted to have magic in her life, so that she could go out and defeat the Darth Vaders of the universe.  When she found out that her sister is a wizard, she wants to be able to do magic, too.  When her family's new computer arrives, Dairine discovers that it can help her do magic.  Her obsession with Star Wars inspires her to visit other planets, and the aliens chasing after her force her to travel to planets even farther away than those.  Although Nita and Kit are searching for her, Dairine has to learn how to use her new magic before the Lone Power catches up with her.  Her adventures will teach her that magic isn't just for fun and games. <br /> <br />I really liked this book.  Although there was more tech talk than I would have liked, I still feel like I followed along fairly well.  It was really interesting, seeing how Dairine's mind works.  She's definitely different from her sister.  Her explorations of other planets were very vivid, and I really enjoyed those parts.  The only real problem I had with this book was the end.  Near the end, everything seemed to get very confusing, and it was not nearly as easy to understand what was going on.  It would've been nice if the ending had been clearer.  All in all, however, I loved this book.  I would recommend it, and this series.	2004-08-07

In this volume, Shuichiro finds and saves an angel stuck in a tree.  The angel, Kohaku, wants to do something for Shuichiro in return, but she doesn't know what.  Shuichiro doesn't know either, because he says he has everything he needs.  Kohaku is determined, however, and stays with him.  She's still got a job of her own to do, though: one of the angel masters is missing. <br /> <br />This isn't the best volume in the series, but it's still really good.  Kohaku is cute, although a bit of a klutz, and the demons are still my favorite characters.  I'm not a big fan of Shuichiro, since he's a bit too outwardly unemotional for my tastes, and the authors don't provide very much insight into what he's thinking.  I would recommend this series to almost anyone.	2004-08-01

The second story is about a mad professor, who is obsessed with creating walking robots.  He finds out that Keiichi and Belldandy have such a robot living with them, and he'll do anything to get ahold of her.   <br /> <br />I've liked all the volumes in this series so far.  While I don't think this volume is one of my favorites, it's still very good.  The artwork is beautiful, the stories show a lot of thought, and the characters are tons of fun to read about.

Lula's back, although she is, for me, becoming less funny and more annoying, since several of the problems in this book are the result of Lula's involvement.  Morelli isn't around much, since Stephanie spends most of her time avoiding him so that he won't lock her in his house for her safety.  Ranger is also back, although he isn't in most of the book - in spite of this, Stephanie finds out a lot about him, even though I'm sure she's only scratched the surface. <br /> <br />This series is still funny, although, in this book more than most of the others, I am supremely glad that I don't have Stephanie's life.  It's way to dangerous, and she doesn't seem to have to sense to stop that.  Maybe, after all this time as a bounty hunter, she doesn't really want to.  Whatever else you say about her job, it isn't boring.  I missed seeing more of Morelli and Ranger, although I liked what there was.  I'm hoping that the next book includes more of them both.   <br />	2004-07-31

The stories are usually interesting.  However, the characters haven't grabbed my interest very much, yet.  I haven't gotten to read the first book yet, and my feelings about this manga may change after I've read more in the series, but I've started other manga series before and have had my attention grabbed a lot faster.   <br /> <br />Cultural issues may be another problem for me.  Usually, when I'm reading a manga, I realize that there are truly Japanese things going on that I'm probably not grasping or even aware of.  It usually doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the story and the characters, however.  With this manga, I was much more aware that there were things going on that I wasn't understanding, and, while I don't think those things were getting in the way of my reading too much, it would have been nice if the editors had included a few more explanations throughout.  All in all, it's definitely not the worst manga I've ever read, and I liked it enough that I'm willing to try out other volumes in the series.	2004-07-31

In order to find out how she can help him, she goes back in time and discovers startling things about his past and his family.  This isn't the best of the Wish books, but it's still really good.  I like all the characters, although the demons are my favorites.  It's a cute series, and I would recommend it to most people.	2004-07-31

There are so many clubs for different fighting styles that they're all fighting for space and money.  Ryoko Mitsurugi is one of the best fighters in the school.  Shizuma Kusanagi comes and shakes everything up by starting K-Fights, which allow students to resolve issues through battle. <br /> <br />The artwork is nice, although the layout is occasionally confusing, since so much tends to go on in one page.  I don't really have a lot of problems with this volume.  The reason I'm giving it a three is because I feel like the characters might as well be cardboard cutouts.  There aren't even all that many hints that there are depths to them.  I'll be reading the rest of this series because I don't think it's bad, but I hope that the other volumes had some depth to the characters personalities.	2004-07-31

In this volume, Shizuma participates in a K-Fight with a teacher, and Ryoko and Tatsuya are in a play together.  This volume gives readers a little more insight into Ryoko, although Tatsuya seems to become more mysterious.  I'm still not sure how much more in going on in Shizuma's mind, other than his next fight, but I like him anyway.  Daisaku, Ryoko's biggest fan, is around for a bit, being cute and more than a bit stalker-like.  I'm still not sure if I would recommend this series, but at least is seems to be getting better.  I'm looking forward to the next volume.	2004-07-31

There are also several pages of sketches at the end.  The artwork is awesome, and the stories are usually pretty good.  My favorites were Heads (Hellboy steps into a really freaky Japanese folktale) and Box Full of Evil, which is one of the longer stories of the bunch.  Pancakes, one of the shortest, was pretty cute.  This probably wasn't the best collection for a beginner like me to start with, but it wasn't bad.  The only thing I really missed was a better insight into the characters involved - other than the Hellboy movie, I have absolutely not experience with any of the Hellboy characters, and I'm starting find out how different the movie is from the comics.	2004-07-31

In this book, the gang deals with Valentine's Day (a dangerous time for the members of the Sohma family, who are cursed to turn into animals from the Chinese Zodiac whenever they become weak or are hugged by a member of the opposite sex). A new member of the Sohma family comes visiting, there's a visit to some hot springs, and Tohru still approaches everything with her usual &quot;glass half full&quot; attitude. This series is really adorable and good natured, and I love the artwork. I've only just started with it - I've read volume 2, but none of the others. Based on what I've seen so far, though, I would recommend this series and this volume to anyone who likes romantic manga.	2004-07-31

His father will soon be coming home, and he wants his family to live a completely legal life.  Although surprised about this new development, Artemis is not too opposed to this idea.  However, he decides to try to restore the Fowl family fortune just one more time.  He has created the C Cube, a powerful computer based on fairy technology that he stole.  When he tries to make a deal with a shady businessman named Jon Spiro, things go badly wrong, and Artemis suddenly finds himself in dire need of help from the very beings he stole the technology from: the fairies.  Spiro has the C Cube, which could mean great danger for both the fairy and human worlds.<br /><br />It took me a while to get through this book, partly because it didn't seem to grab my interest as much as the first book.  However, I did enjoy it.  It's fascinating, reading about Artemis's development throughout the series, and this book contains some really interesting character developments.  The supporting characters are also wonderful.  Mulch is back, and Juliet, one of my favorites, gets to take part in some of the action.  The story developments with Butler, Artemis's bodyguard and best friend, had me on the edge of my seat.  This book will likely be confusing if you haven't read any of the previous ones, since the author refers to previous events but doesn't really explain them all that much, but I still think this book could be enjoyable for even first time Artemis Fowl readers.  In fact, for some, this may be a better book to start with, since I know some of the complaints for the first book were about the unlikability of Artemis.  The Artemis of the first book was cold and calculated.  In this book, he's well on his way to developing a conscience, and you can definitely tell he cares for people.  He's more human, even if he isn't all that much like a normal teenage boy.	2004-07-24

Ranma's been visiting her as the female version of himself. He doesn't want her to know that, depending on the temperature of water splashed onto him, he can become either a boy or a girl. One day, a stranger visits Ranma's mother and she becomes convinced that this stranger is Ranma. Ranma knows that can't be true and tries to find out who this stranger really is and what he wants. <br />  <br /> As usual, Rumiko Takahashi's writing is hilarious. The fighting techniques in this book were really funny, especially once their intended use was revealed. I don't keep up with the Ranma series as much as I could, but I seem to love every book I pick up. If you like quirky manga and for some reason have not stumbled across Rumiko Takahashi's works yet, I would suggest picking up a volume of this series. This story is fairly stand-alone, although some of the details may be hard to understand if you don't have any previous experience with the series. As usual, there is a &quot;story thus far&quot; section, as well as a character section.	2004-07-24

This book is about Gemma, a sixteen-year-old girl who lives in India with her mother and father.  After her mother is murdered (something that Gemma witnesses in a strange and frightening vision), Gemma is sent to a finishing school in London.  The story takes place in 1895.  Gemma gradually gets to know the other girls at the school.  Most of them are in some way emotionally damaged, and they deal with the hopelessness of their situations by taking everything out on those who happen to be weaker than themselves.  What ends up tying Gemma to several of the girls is a diary she discovers, the diary of two girls who attended the school years ago and practiced magic.  In a way, this book has the elements of a mystery, as Gemma discovers the link between her mother's murder, the two girls, and her own visions.<br />I'm still not sure if I like this book.  For a great deal of the book, I had the feeling that I didn't really know any of the characters, not even Gemma, even though the book was from her point of view.  Maybe this was intentional, but it was disconcerting.  If you're looking for a book with nice, pleasant characters, you should look elsewhere, because there aren't really any here.  They all do mean things, even Gemma, and the reasons they have for doing these things doesn't seem to detract much from the fact that they did them.  Really, though, you'd think that, after reading all 403 pages of this book, that I'd feel like I knew more about the characters and events, but this book feels like it leaves more questions behind than it answers.  I've heard that there will be more books about Gemma, which is good, since there needs to be more if the story is to be understood.  The book leaves Gemma's powers, and her relationships with the people she calls her friends, in limbo.	2004-07-03

The first is the beginning of the series Demon Diary, in which Raenef, a demon who seems very clueless about being a demon, becomes a demon lord.  Eclipse is assigned to be his teacher.  Raenef is just adorable, and even Eclipse isn't totally immune to his cuteness.  Even as Eclipse tries to teach Raenef how to fight and be ruthless, like a good demon lord, the two begin to care for one another.  Although there is no sex, and really no suggestion that the relationship has gotten that far (although it's definitely not inconcievable that it will), if you have a problem with even the suggestion of gayness, I would suggest you not touch this book.  It will only upset you.  The next part of the book is a short manga story called \\"Crystal Heart,\\" which although not bad, was a bit confusing in the end.  The third part of the book is another short manga story called \\"Terra,\\" which is also good and less confusing.  Although I thought both of the short stories at the end of the book were pretty good, I couldn't help but wish that I could've voted for them not to be there, if that would've allowed more of Raenef and Eclipse's story to be told.  I really would rather have read more about them, and their part of the book felt VERY short.  That's really the main reason why I'm giving this book a four instead of a five.  I can't wait to read more in this series.	2004-07-03

I'm sure that a lot of reviewers have explained the events of this book very well, so I won't bother in my review.  This series is really addictive, as long as you're okay with incredibly cute characters and character interaction.  Everyone is just adorable, even when they happen to be adults.  The facial expressions on all the characters are excellent.  If you like one of the Cardcaptor books, I think it would be really hard not to want to get them all, since CLAMP often gives you just enough character relationship information in one book to have you wanting more.  The plots of the Cardcaptor books aren't all that complex, but it's not the plots that are the most important part of the Cardcaptor series.  A big part of the series is the character interactions, how everyone's relationships with others develops.  That's why I keep reading the series - I want to know how things turn out with everyone!	2004-07-03

My mom recommeded this series to me a while ago, and I'm glad she did.  I'm reading the series a bit out of order, but I'm still enjoying it.  This is the first book in the series.  It begins with Nita, a thirteen-year-old girl who has the misfortune of being beat up a lot by a bully.  While hiding in the library, Nita comes across a book called _So You Want To Be a Wizard_.  The book gets her on the road to becoming a wizard.  In the process, she meets Kit, another young wizard-in-training.  There are probably other people who've explained the  book better than I ever could, so I'm not going to bother.  I really enjoyed this book, because all the characters and their magic seemed so real to me.  Also, the author designed some of her world's \\"rules\\" with people like me in mind: early on, Nita reads that one good sign of a potential wizard is that the person can't go to sleep without reading something first.  Since this book was enough to make me wish magic were real, those lines made me smile.  Hey, I can dream, can't I?  I highly recommend this series and book to everyone, young and old.	2004-07-03

Basically, it's a bunch of comics in which bunnies commit suicide in some really strange ways.  I'm sure everyone who's read this and liked it has their favorite few.  There seems to be a suicide theme for just about everyone - Star Trek, Star Wars, football, aliens, farming, and the Olympics, just to name a few.  One of the things that makes these comics so funny, I think, is the absolutely blank expression on the bunnies faces - every weird act of suicide just happens to be an everyday thing in their lives.  I can definitely see the price being a problem, for some, since this whole book can be read (&quot;looked through&quot; would actually be more accurate, since there are hardly any words to read - these comics mostly don't have captions, or any speaking) in a few minutes, although some of the suicides may take more time to decipher than others.  The really squeemish may also have problems with this book, since some of the comics show the &quot;after&quot; of the suicide attempt.  The comics aren't drawn realistically, so I wouldn't think that the &quot;afters&quot; would be too much of a problem with most people, especially the kind of people who would pick up a book with the words &quot;bunny&quot; and &quot;suicides&quot; in the title.  The title and covers should be warning enough, for those who might be offended by this kind of humor.  Anyway, if you don't mind the price and the length, you should get this book.  It's really very funny, and you can gross out your friends and family with it!	2004-07-03

I've sort of been reading this series backwards, starting with the Master of the Clow books and moving on to the original series.  In spite of that, they're still fun to read, and I'm amused by the way that Li acted early on in the series versus the way he acts later.  In this book, Sakura and her class do a production of Sleeping Beauty in which the parts were chosen at random - really, really at random.  As usual, something happens that puts those around her in danger, so Sakura must save everyone from the power of a Clow card.  The characters are all a lot of fun, and the art is gorgeous.  One day, I will finally have read all the Cardcaptor books.  I'm getting there...	2004-07-03

By the time I'm done, the sweetness of the series will probably have rotted my teeth out, but at least I will be a happy toothless person.  In this book, Sakura finally deals with her feelings for Yukito, along with the usual battling of the Clow Cards.  Sakura's talk with Li about her feelings for Yukito was, I think, the best reason to have this book.  The Cardcaptor books always make me smile, even during a reread, which is as good a reason as any to get something, I think.	2004-07-03

I never end up with the first book in a manga series, it's always something far into it.  You wouldn't think that book 4 would be all that far into a series, but, from the way that the characters talk about things in the end, I think it might be the last book in the series.  Lovely colored \\"story thus far\\" section at the beginning of the book is beautiful, but only marginally helpful.  I had to try to learn things as I read, although I'm hoping to get my hands on the other three books soon.  The artwork throughout the manga is gorgeous, and I would love to find out more about the demon characters in this book, so that I could finally figure out why their relationships with some of the angel characters happens to be so good.  Although this book seems to be more about the relationships between the characters than humor, I really enjoyed some of the humorous parts as well.	2004-07-03
US	42442234	R3RBNDOCKWEMP5	0786817291	987871165	The Disappearance (W.I.T.C.H. Chapter Books #2)	Books	3	2	4	N	N	once again, neither bad nor good	I think I'm going to have to give up on this series, since there are too many things I'd like to read for me to be wasting my time, even just an hour or two's worth, on something that's only so-so.  The format, with a few pages of comics at the beginning and the end of the book, while the rest is straight written word, is interesting, although I can't help but think that the whole thing would be a lot easier to swallow if it were just all in comic form.  I actually really like the comic parts of it.  They seem less clunky than the actual book parts.  <br />This book continues (very slowly) the story of Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin, five girls who've recently discovered that they have magical abilities.  They're still dealing with their new powers, and they're trying to figure out what happened to their friend Elyon.  Some of the time jumps in this book were fairly confusing, since it sometimes took a while for it to be clear that a few weeks have passed since the previous passage.  Once again, I found the transformation sequences to be annoying - basically when the girls' transformations into their magical selves (seen on the back cover of the book) is described, their bodies become curvier, their lips poutier.  Suddenly, they are supermodels.  While I'm skeptical that things like playing with Barbie dolls can damage girls' self images, these passages still grate, probably because they seem to emphasize that these girls will only be \\"beautiful\\" if they're magical.  In the comic parts of the book, there isn't nearly as much emphasis on this aspect - the girls look slightly different, but the change basically comes down to different hair and a bit of light lipstick.  At any rate, the book is so-so.  Some girls may enjoy it, but there are better books out there.  I've always thought Dragonsinger and Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey were very good, although both books would certainly take longer to read than the W.I.T.C.H. books.	2004-07-03

The kids in the digiworld battle Leomon, Bakemon, Whamon, and other digimon.  For some reason, the animated versions of these stories felt less disjointed - in the manga it just feels like too much is happening too fast, with digimon of the moment appearing every few seconds.  The battles are also a lot better in animated form.  The artwork just doesn't seem to capture those or digivolving (the transformation of a digimon into a more powerful form) very well.	2004-07-03

The series centers around Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress who lives in a small town where everyone knows what she can do, even if no one really wants to think about it that much.  In this book, Sookie's ex-boyfriend, a vampire named Bill, has left for Peru.  This doesn't mean that Sookie's life is quiet, however.  She finds Eric running along a road.  He was apparently cursed by a witch and now has amnesia.  Sookie has to keep him safe from the witches while she and his people try to get his memory back.  Unfortunately, the witches also have shapeshifters in their ranks, so Sookie, the vampires, and the werewolves have to work together if everyone is to survive.<br />Since I've never really liked Bill, I was glad that he was gone for most of this book.  Although I missed the old Eric, I loved the relationship that Sookie had with Eric in this book.  It was really very sweet, and I even cried a little at the end (not telling you why, though - you'll have to read the book to find out).  I love the author's sense of humor, even though there didn't seem to be as many opportunities for it in this book.  The book may not have ended with a great big plot cliffhanger, aside from a few things, but it did end in a fairly large character cliffhanger.  I can't wait to find out how Sookie deals with her relationships with all the various people in this book.  I can't really say much about that without giving parts of the book away, but, if you liked the previous books, this book is a must read.  If you haven't read the previous books, there are several recap passages in this book.  However, you should probably read the other books first, if you want to fully enjoy this book.	2004-06-28
US	42442234	R30FCZNW13VM0D	0060275111	505341703	Ella Enchanted	Books	5	2	2	N	N	much better than the movie	I picked this book up because I saw the movie that is based on this book a while back.  First, I need to say that the movie was only very loosely based on this book - I recognized bits and pieces, but I was surprised at how much was changed.  Even many character personalities were changed.  It was a bit odd, at times, but I found that I enjoyed the book a great deal more than the movie.  Ella was cursed at birth to always do what anyone tells her to do.  In response, Ella tries to either delay her reaction to an order or to carry out the order in a way that the person who gave it never intended.  This allows Ella to live a fairly tolerable life.  However, after a girl at finishing school discovers Ella's curse, her life becomes much more miserable.  Ella tries to find a way to break her curse, but her life gets even worse when her father marries a horrible woman with two equally horrible daughters.  One of these daughters is, unfortunately, the girl from finishing school.  <br />The book is a bit darker than the movie ever was, and I was constantly wondering what new and horrible order others would give Ella.  The Char of this book seemed a much more likely future king than the Char of the movie, and I grew to like this one more than the other.  The author handled the emotion of the story perfectly, and I even cried a little about some of the things that Ella had to do.  This is the kind of book that I was always combing the shelves of the library for when I was younger: it's an interesting young adult book that doesn't insult the intelligence of its readers.	2004-06-28
US	42442234	R2JW5JCQNV4EFB	042519485X	806820342	Undead and Unwed (Queen Betsy, Book 1)	Books	5	21	22	N	N	really enjoyable	I was prepared for this book to be so-so, which means I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be really good.  The book begins with Betsy Taylor's fantastically bad day - she gets laid off and dies on the same day.  However, she later wakes up as a vampire.  Her mother and best friend handle her newly undead status rather well, and it's not long before Betsy is contacted by other vampires.  The vampires are composed of two waring groups.  Both groups want her, but one believes that she is the prophesied vampire queen, since she can do things no other vampire can do.  Betsy's not too happy about the idea of joining either group, even though Sinclair, the leader of the group that believes she's the vampire queen, is really attractive.  However, Betsy badly needs help learning how to live as a vampire, so, in spite of the fact that she'd rather go shoe shopping with her best friend, she reluctantly joins Sinclair's group.<br />Betsy was a fun heroine, although she was a bit dense at times.  Had she been a normal vampire, she wouldn't have survived more than 24 hours.  I had to be careful not to read this book in public, because parts of this book made me laugh so hard that I'm sure I would've gotten stared at a lot.  I wish some of the characters had been better developed, but the book's humor made up for a lot of that.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book, so that I can find out more about some of the other characters.  If you've read Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books and liked them, I definitely suggest that you read this book.  There's one thing I need to add, however.  Although the spine of this book calls it a paranormal romance, I wouldn't call it a romance.  Yes, there are several sex scenes, and, yes, there is a gorgeous guy who alternately annoys and attracts Betsy, but there isn't really any romance.  This book is pretty much all Betsy, without any romantic relationship development - that, I imagine, will probably come later.  Just awarning for those who might be expecting a traditional quirky romance.  I can't wait to get my hands on the next book!	2004-06-28

I've only read one of Feehan's books before, _Dark Magic_, and I didn't really like it.  The hero, Gregori, was domineering to a fault, the heroine was a bit of an idiot, and the writing was repetitive.  In spite of my feelings about that book, I decided to try Feehan's immensely popular series again.  This time, I somehow managed to pick a book a little more to my tastes.  In this book, Shea O'Halloran, a young doctor, has been having dreams about a man in terrible pain.  She goes to the Carpathian Mountains, the land of her birth, in order to escape men who seem to believe that she is a vampire.  While there, Shea finds the man from her dreams, who at first attacks her out of a mistaken belief that she is the cause of his pain.  Shea tries to heal this man, Jacques, and, in spite of herself, she begins to fall in love with him.  Jacques believes that she is his lifemate, the only one who can keep the madness within him at bay.  He would stop at nothing to protect her from the men who want to hurt her and the vampire who wants to claim her as his own, the same vampire who betrayed him (Jacques).  For those of you familiar with the series, this book also has Mikhail, Raven, Gregori, and Byron (who I'm including in this list, although I'm not sure if he's ever in another book).<br />Because of my previous experience with this series, I was a little wary about reading this book, but, for me, this book was a whole lot better than _Dark Magic_.  Jacques is domineering, yes, but Shea can, for the most part, hold her own against him, since his will often seems to turn to putty around her.  I really enjoyed the story itself, even though the human villain characters were once again like cardboard cutouts of Badness.  The writing seemed less repetitive than in _Dark Magic_, where references to the main characters often involved the use of the same words, over and over again.  Shea was in some serious denial, though - it seemed like it took her forever to realize that Jacqueswas not just a man with a serious blood disorder, even though he drank glasses of blood and survived for years with a stake through his chest.  Still, this book was pretty enjoyable, and I think I'll try to find more books in this series that I can like as much, or more, than this one.	2004-06-20

The Kingpin is free, despite that fact that he was caught on tape murdering someone, J. Jonah Jameson is backing a politician who's running on an anti-Spider-Man platform, Peter Parker is attracted to a cat burglar called the Black Cat (in spite of the fact that he's already got a girlfriend), and Elektra's out to kill Spider-Man.  That's a lot of things for only seven issues, but it's all handled very clearly.  Elektra isn't really as big a part of the story as the cover would have you believe, but the Black Cat's around a lot.  Peter's a teenager in this volume (and, I suspect, in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics as a whole, but I've never read any of the others, so I don't know for sure), so he's got to deal with the usual: school, the fact that his girlfriend's parents hate him, and a bit of a crush.  The artwork and coloring are both gorgeous, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.	2004-06-16

This book is about five girls who discover they have magical powers that are linked, for the most part, with the elements fire, water, air, and earth.  Will and Taranee have only recently moved into town and are still trying to make friends (in fact, the start of the book is Will's first day in town and the school).  They soon are befriended by Irma, Cornelia, and Hay Lin.  In this book, the group mostly seems to worry about what to wear to the big party at school and what the guys they like think of them, but I imagine that the later books will go more detail about the characters who'd like to stop them from saving the universe with their powers.  I'm also interested in finding out more about Elyon, a friend of the group's who's left out of all the powers stuff.<br />Unlike some of the reviewers of this book, I have not seen this in the original comic form.  This book does have comic inserts at the beginning and the end, which I actually liked a bit better than the book itself.  The comic insert at the end overlaps a bit with some of the events at the end of the book, which made it clear that the author wasn't very good at depicting the magical parts with words.  Also, I, like another reviewer, wasn't happy with the way the girls treated Elyon.  Teasing, I can see, I really can't believe that any real friends would have tried to punish her for not getting a good grade.  As far as the writing style goes, I thought that the constant point of view switching was very confusing.  Each chapter was written from the perspective of one of over six characters.  I do think that the story has promise, however, and there are a few characters who I'm looking forward to seeing more of.  Although this isn't really a bad book, it's not all that good either.	2004-06-16

Okay, so I still haven't read hardly any of the original series, which means I'm still a bit in the dark about some things.  However, none of that made this book any less fun.  Sakura's class gets a new boy named Eriol, who Li is jealous of, because he believes Sakura likes him (Eriol).  Also, there are enchantments popping up in the city that Sakura is completely unable to stop.  She has to figure out what to do, and fast.  As usual, the artwork is lovely, and I just love reading about the characters and their relationships.  If you're just looking for action, you should probably look elsewhere: the best part of the book is the way that each of the character's relationships to one another are developed.	2004-06-16

If you haven't read any of this series before, you should know that Ranma changes into a girl when splashed with cold water.  His father, on the other hand, changes into a panda.  A lot of this is explained just before the story begins, in a &quot;the story thus far&quot; section and a &quot;cast of characters section.&quot;  Although, as usual, I believe that it's always a good idea to know something about a series before jumping into it at a later point (especially this far into the series), I don't think that this volume will be too hard to understand if you've never read any Ranma 1/2 before.  The two explanation sections to a fairly good, if brief, job, and, once yet get past the beginning of book, there's another story that's pretty self-contained.  Since I haven't read the previous volume, the beginning of the book, which is continuation of a fight between Ranma, Ryoga, Mousse, and a trio of martial artists, made me feel a little lost.  After that, however, come two stories that are unrelated to this beginning part.  In the first, Ranma has to deal with a new teacher, who is known for her ability to deal with problem students.  This teacher can use an unbeatable technique, which there is only one very awkward way to defeat.  In the second story, Akane wants to investigate something that happened in her past.  Only the first story is actually finished in this volume.  For the rest of the second story, I think you have to get the next volume.  <br />If you're looking for humorous manga, I really recommend Rumiko Takahashi.  She does wonderful work and has a very odd and wacky sense of humor.  Then you, too, can get looked at oddly whenever you try to explain this series to someone.  :o)	2004-06-16

The main characters of the book are Kit and Nita, two young wizards.  In this book, Kit is assigned to find a young wizard in training named Darryl and figure out why Darryl's Ordeal is taking so long.  Kit would like it if Nita were there to help him, but she's still dealing with the death of her mother.  However, Nita can't devote all her time to grieving, because a possible alien has been entering her dreams.  Whoever or whatever it is, it seems to need her help.  She has to help it fast, though, because Kit will need her help if he is to survive his own attempts to help Darryl.  <br />The book was, for me, occaisionally slow, but I still enjoyed it.  The characters were all very interesting, and I'm looking forward to reading the previous books in the series, so that I can find out more about them.  I also enjoyed the humor in this book, especially the parts with the remote control and television.  People who are interested in autism or have autistic family members may also like this particular book, since an autistic character plays a very important role.  I thought that the way Duane presented the mental landscape of an autistic character was fascinating.  I can't wait to read the rest of this series.	2004-06-09

Eriol is going back to England, and Syaoran Li is going back to Hong Kong.  Sakura finally has to decide what she really feels for Li.  As usual, the most interesting thing about this series is the relationships - if the series were just about capturing cards, I would have stopped reading a long time ago.  I loved this volume, because reading about Sakura as she works through her feelings was very interesting.  The artwork is still beautiful, and I definitely recommend this book.  I think it would probably be best to read this volume after reading at least some of the previous volumes.  There is a \\"the story thus far\\" section, as well as some information about each of the main characters, but you might still miss out on the emotional impact of this book if you begin with it.	2004-06-09

Now I can't read the books fast enough!  In this book, Clow Reed once again tests Sakura.  The relationships between the characters has always been the most interesting thing for me in this series.  Syaoran is still trying to work up the courage to tell Sakura what his feelings for her are, and Toya and Yukito's relationship gets developed more.  Toya has to do something, because Yue is fading away, and if he fades, then Yukito (Yue's temporary form) will go too.  <br />Once again, the artwork is lovely - it's really detailed!  The right-to-left format, which is the format that the comic was originally in, can take some getting used to if you haven't dealt with it before, but the back of the book gives instructions for reading this format.  The original sound effects characters have also been preserved, although, unfortunately, there is no translation provided for those characters.  Mostly, this doesn't matter to me, but sometimes it would be nice to know what the sound effect was supposed to be.  Still, I definitely recommend picking this book up, or at least getting started on the series, because it's worth it.	2004-06-09

This has been my favorite origami books since I first discovered it.  The instructions are very good; I have usually been able to understand them during my first attempt at a design.  If you're just beginning origami, with no previous experience, there is an explanation of the folding symbols on the back of the front cover.  However, there are no detailed beginners explanations, so, unless you feel up to it, you may not want to get this book if you have never done origami before.  If you do have a little experience, this is a very good book.  Some of the designs are more simple than others, and even the simple designs look good.  I am always annoyed at &quot;easy origami&quot; books that are easy, but have horrible looking designs.  This is not the case with this book, and, in fact, I have created some beautiful origami mobiles using only designs found in this book.  There may not be as much variety in this book as you might find in other origami books, but you can be reasonably certain that you'll be able to fold all the designs found in this book.  I have yet to encounter an origami book that I have gotten as much use out of as this one.	2004-06-09

I just love this series, even though Miaka can be annoying.  All the other characters make up for that!  In this volume, Miaka is helped by someone she thought had died, and she is found by a Seiryu Celestial Warrior.  Miaka ran away from Tamahome in the previous book (it seems like she's always running off - she really should learn better communication skills), because she thinks she is no longer a virgin, capable of being Priestess of Suzaku.  Watase's artwork is beautiful, and I love the comments sections that she occaisionally adds on the side.  There are even a few (only a few, so don't get your hopes up) extras in the book, such as a &quot;What's so fushigi about Fushigi Yuugi?&quot; comic strip.  This volume is fairly late in the series, so I would recommend reading some of the earlier volumes first, but this series is really very good.	2004-06-09

This book is especially dark and depressing.  I can handle a dark, brooding, crime-fighting Batman, but the Batman in this volume is just obsessed to the point of danger.  He refuses to see anything but his own point of view.  He won't even consider another point of view, because he believes that his view of the world is less biased than anyone else's.  He is not an enjoyable character.  <br />In this book, he is hunting a woman who, as part of a protest against Wayne Enterprises, set off a bomb several years before that killed a lot of people.  Batman turns hunting her into his own crusade, partially because of the deaths and partially because, it seems, his ego is continually hurt by the fact that she eludes him for so long.  The artwork looks lovely, but I just can't like the story.  I haven't read a lot of Batman comics, but this doesn't seem like a prime example of them.	2004-06-09

It confuses her, because she has no idea why he would want to fight her, since he chose her to be Master of the Clow.  This book is very interesting, because this is where Sakura finds out everything about Clow Reed's reasons for fighting her, as well has the connections that other people she knows have to him.  This book has a lot of Yue, who is one of my favorites, for totally shallow reasons.  Reading about Syaoran Li's continued hidden love for Sakura is also a lot of fun.  It would probably be good to have read some of the previous books in the series, although I certainly haven't been reading them in order.  I definitely recommend this volume.	2004-06-09

The X-Men have been around for a while, and I have only read a small fraction of the X-Men comics out there.  This volume showcases comics penciled by Marc Silvestri, which means that the issues included are Wolverine #31-34, 41-42, and 48-50.  I was a bit confused about how connected these groups of comics were, plot-wise, but it was still an interesting read.  The first comics in the volume are about Wolverine battling Yakuza on really scary drugs, the next comic has the Hunter in Darkness.  Then there's some comics with a little android girl named Elsie-Dee, as well as comics where Wolverine tries to find out which of his memories are real and which are false.  <br />For me, it seems like a pretty mixed bag, but avid fans of the X-Men and Wolverine might feel differently.  For the most part, I really enjoyed the artwork - Silvestri does an excellent Wolverine, in my opinion.	2004-06-09

Wollie, the main character, has so much going on in her life that no one could really blame her for being stressed.  She wants to upgrade her greeting card shop from Welcome! to Willkommen! status, which means she has to make sure that her shop in absolutely perfect for the entire duration of the extremely strict evaluation process.  Wollie is also part of a research project for a book called _How to Avoid Getting Dumped All the Time_.  This means that she has to date forty men in sixty days, which is tough, even when your life isn't complicated.  Wollie also has to deal with a murder, the mob, and other criminals.  She gets kidnapped by a charismatic and attractive man she calls Doc, which leads the mob and those other criminals into believing that both Doc and Wollie know the location of a valuable item.  Then, of course, there are the interesting minor characters, my favorites being Wollie's paranoid schizophrenic brother and Doc's mute daughter.  <br />You'd think that, somewhere along the line, Wollie would prioritize in such a way that her own life would be at the top of the list, but this isn't really the case.  Wollie tries to juggle EVERYTHING, since the future status of her shop seems to be just as important to her as her life.  This makes the book very complicated and hectic near the end, which is sad, since I would have enjoyed everything more if it hadn't gotten so hard to follow.	2004-06-02

The artwork in this manga is amazingly detailed.  In this book, Sakura takes part in field day, deals with a few Clow cards (I'm still trying to figure those out, so I'm looking forward to getting ahold of the first book), and meets Li (a boy who doesn't seem to like her at all).  There's a lot about Sakura's relationships with other people, particuarly her friends and Yuki, a guy she likes.  Incidentally, Li also seems to like Yuki.  This book deals a lot with \\"who likes who,\\" which I'm guessing is the same for the whole series.  I'm looking forward to reading some more.	2004-06-02

Before they go, Miaka and Tamahome have to deal with some devestating news that will keep them from being with one another.  Also, Suboshi wants revenge for his twin borther Amiboshi's death, and Tamahome is the one to suffer.  I won't say what happens, but I cried at this part.  Although there is a &quot;the story thus far&quot; section, as well as a section that says a little (a very little) about many of the characters, this book won't have nearly as much emotional impact if you haven't read the previous books.  I love the author/artist's style of art, and I have really enjoyed what I've read of the series so far.  It can be painful to read, because, when people die in this series, they stay dead, but it's definitely worth reading.  I also, in some ways, prefer reading the manga to watching the anime.  Unlike the manga, I own all of the anime for this series, but, at least with the manga, I don't have to listen to Miaka's whiny voice.  Miaka is as whiny as I want her to be when I'm reading, lol.  This series is definitely a must-read.	2004-05-25

However, I'm still happy I got this book.  For one thing, the price really isn't all that bad, and for another, it's nice not to have to read anything off a screen.  I had a hideous headache from trying to read all of Sluggy Freelance in one weekend, lol (and, by the way, there are references to Sluggy Freelance in this comic, so Sluggy fans may want to take a look at it).  Also, Fred Gallagher (Piro) adds some commentary to many of the comics, which would probably be enjoyable for people who've already read the comics online.  <br />Basically, this comic is about two gamers who end up flying to Tokyo, where they spend all their money and can't afford to fly back home.  Largo enjoys RPGs, first person shooters, and other games, while Piro enjoys dating sims.  The games they enjoy tend to color their views of the world, which can be pretty amusing.  The comic is a lot of fun to read, and I'm looking forward to reading more.  Also, I really like the artwork, which is pencil drawings without any inking or coloring.	2004-05-25

In this book, Inu Yasha and Kagome are suffering the aftermath of a really bad argument, and one of them has to apologize to the other.  Also, Kagura, a woman with the ability to control the dead, appears, causing further problems between Inu Yasha and Koga (the wolf-demon from the previous book).  I still find myself wondering how blind Inu Yasha and Kagome have to be to not see that they love each other, but I love seeing how they interact.  I can't wait to read more of this series.  Although I'm sure it's possible to jump in at this point in the seris, if you start with this book, I recommend that you somehow get around to reading the previous books as well.  You'd be missing out on a lot, otherwise.	2004-05-25

Takahashi does so well with character interactions that I'm not sure I'll ever get tired of it.  In this book, Sessho-Maru, Inu Yasha's evil full-demon brother, is wounded but kept safe by a little girl.  Also, Kagome gets kidnapped by a wolf-demon who wants to make her his mate and use her to find more shards of the Shikon Jewel.  Okay, so I'm a romantic, but this part of the book just makes me sigh - Inu Yasha is just so cute when he tries to deal with the idea that Kagome might be falling for the Koga, the wolf-demon.  It's probably posssible to jump into the series at this point, especially since there is a \\"the story thus far\\" section, as well as a character section that gives important information about many of the previously introduced characters involved in this book.  However, you should really get around to reading some of the previous books, or you'll be missing out on a lot.  For example, Sessho-Maru's treatment of the little girl won't be nearly as shocking unless you know what he was like in the previous books.	2004-05-25

There were a ton of characters, as though the author were trying to make sure that she introduced just about every character she might use later in the series.  I noticed this early in her Dark Hunters series (writing as Sherrilyn Kenyon), and I was relieved when, later in the series, she stopped introducing about a dozen or so new characters that will obviously one day get their own books.  I've gotten the feeling that she likes to do that so that she can get introductions out of the way, so that she can later concentrate on the stories, but it can be very confusing.  <br />Unfortunately, the many secondary characters in A Dark Champion tend to take away from the main characters, Rowena and Stryder, making them and any changes that happen to them seem pretty simplistic.  However, Kinley MacGregor does have a knack for writing strong men made sweet by their vulnerabilities (Stryder doesn't think Rowena could ever love him - he's a warrior, not a poet or a musician, and he can't read or write).  You may, like me, get a bit confused while reading this book, wondering exactly how many assissins are involved and whether Stryder is capable of meeting someone who doesn't have some sort of connection to the horrible things that happened to him in his past, but there are parts of this book that are very sweet.  I'm not sure if I would recommend this for a first-time Kinley MacGregor reader, however, since she throws around a lot of names that were mentioned in previous books - this book is the first Brotherhood of the Sword book, but it has a lot of connections with the MacAllisters books - and those names may further contribute to any confusion this book causes.  _Born in Sin_ and _Taming the Scotsman_ are two booksthat she lists as being both part of the Brotherhood series and the MacAllisters series, so it might be a good idea to read those.	2004-05-03

Of the three authors who contributed to this book, I have only encountered Mercedes Lackey's works before.  This book is a sort of experiment where all three authors try their hands at the romantic fantasy genre.<br />Mercedes Lackey's &quot;Counting Crows&quot; is the first story in the book.  In it, Gwynn is wedded to a man she has never seen before, in order to ensure the safety of her father's lands.  She goes to her husband hoping that he will be a man she can learn to love and finds instead that he is a brutal man who rapes her and beats her.  While Gwynn brings order to her new household and decides whether to use her magic against her husband, she falls in love with one of her husband's knights, Sir Atremus.  The story was an okay fantasy story, but a miserable romantic fantasy story.  Gwynn was the most fleshed out of the characters, but she was too perfect to be truly interesting.  I found myself more interested in Robin.  Gwynn's husband was Bad, with only the hint of a backstory, not enough to make him more than a cardboard Bad Guy.  Atremus was useless, which actually wasn't too bad, since I kept forgetting he existed.  Gwynn may have fallen in love with him, but I didn't know enough about him to feel anything for him.  Gwynn and Atremus apparently had long conversations that led to deepening feelings for each other, but Lackey just glossed over most of them.  Since I know that in Lackey is capable of creating great romantic plots, this story was really disappointing and not good enough to be a keeper no matter what genre it's labeled as.<br />Rachel Lee's &quot;Drusilla's Dream&quot; was the second story in the book.  I enjoyed the characters, and this story could have been very good, but the way Lee chose to write it made it, in my opinion, the worst story in the book.  Technically, most of the story takes place during Drusilla's night shift job, while she's typing data into her computer.  As she types, she's on autopilot, daydreaming about a world where she is a princess on a quest to find the Key of Morgania.  Details from her job work her way into her daydream, such as the janitor, who becomes a powerful wizard, and Miles, her supervisor at work and the Behemoth tamer in her dreams.  Although reality and dreams get really mixed up, and there's evidence that Miles is aware of Drusilla's dreams, I had a hard time seeing her dreams as evidence that she and Miles were falling in love.  Unlike Lackey's story, which didn't feel like a romance, this did, but, unfortunately, it was a badly written one.  If the entire story had been set in Drusilla's world, without any hint that there was a real world, it would have been a good, but very odd, story.  I don't mind odd, though.<br />Catherine Asaro's &quot;Moonglow&quot; was the best of the three.  Jarid is the heir to the throne until his parents are killed in an ambush.  The entire kingdom believes he is dead, but he in reality he is still alive, deaf, mute, and blind.  Iris, who believes she has no real magic, finds him.  It's decided that Iris must marry Jarid, and much of the story covers how Jarid and Iris get to know one another.  My explanation sounds ver cheesy, but I'm trying not to reveal too much.  It's an excellent fantasy and romance, and I'm looking forward to the first book in this series.  Asaro writes better romantic short fiction than many romance authors.  I may keep the book just for this story.  It's fascinating reading how Iris and Jarid fall in love even though Jarid can barely communicate and can't see or hear anything around him.<br />Overall, it's a weak book, but, if you can get it cheap, I would recommend it just for the last story.	2004-02-01
US	42442234	R2KL1YKMG8TO0D	0505524864	364364978	Spellbound (The Djinn Series, Book 4)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent	This is a really great read, and an excellent fantasy romance.  Although it helps to have read the other books (you'll recognize some of the minor characters in this and know some djinn information) this is really a stand alone book.  If you've never read anything in the series before, don't worry, all the important information is explained to you.  If you like romance books with nicely done fantasy, and if you like your romance heros to be alpha, but not super alpha, then you should really pick up this book, or at least one of the earlier ones in the series.  In this book, the focus is Zayne and Madeline.  Zayne is a djinni (a genie, only he doesn't live in a lamp, and he only grants wishes if he's been enslaved), and he's very important to his world, Kaf.  His music keeps Kaf in balance, and, unfortunately, something's wrong with his music and his magic.  In order to restore the balance to his magic, he has to find his soulmate.  Madeline, a dancer suffering from crippling stage fright, is the woman he's looking for, but finding her only leads to more complications.  After the glimpse of Zayne the author gave us in Enchantment, I was hoping he'd get his own book.  Zayne's book was just as good as I had hoped it would be, and I can't wait for the next book.  Kathleen Nance is my new favorite romance author.	2003-07-19
US	42442234	R2TQEW87978JO2	0373218397	575803812	Summer Pleasures	Books	3	4	4	N	N	fun enough, but not great	I enjoyed reading the two books in this volume (this book has reprints of Second Nature and One Summer), but I don't think I'm going to keep this book around.  Second Nature featured Lee Radcliffe, a reporter for Celebrity magazine, and Hunter Brown, a reclusive writer of popular horror novels.  Lee is determined to get the interview of a lifetime, but the time she spends getting to know Hunter makes her think about more than just her article.  One Summer featured a friend of Lee's, Bryan Mitchell, and Shade Colby.  Shade and Bryan have to work together on a photography assignment.  They see the world in entirely different ways - Shade sees the gritty sides of life, while Bryan enjoys the fun she finds - but that doesn't stop them from becoming attracted to one another.  Although I did have fun reading the books, I didn't think any of the characters were really all that wonderful.  They were okay, but they didn't grab me, and they aren't enough to entice me to reread this book.  I liked the fact that both stories were basically about the characters finding out a lot about each other because of the closeness their circumstances demanded.  Still, the characters weren't really up to par, and there were occaisionally little things that bugged me (we never find out what the genre of the book Lee is writing is, for instance).  A lot of the first book felt like \\"Nora Roberts' Advice to Writers\\" (Hunter gave a lot of writing advice and opinions), and the second book seemed to end rather abruptly.  I think there are better Nora Roberts books out there, although, if you can find a cheap copy, this still isn't a bad read.	2003-07-02
US	42442234	RFQX1YU46IPLG	0515133620	346308894	Tapestry	Books	4	4	5	N	N	mostly a good read	I thought three of the four stories were pretty good - Madeline Hunter's story was the only one I couldn't really get into, although I did manage to finish it.  What all the stories have in common is their medieval setting and a tapestry (not the same tapestry, but every one of the stories has one)<br />To Kiss In the Shadows by Lynn Kurland - Lianna is a noblewoman who hides behind the tapestries she creates because she wants no one to see her ruined face.  The other ladies make life a misery for her, and she doesn't expect any man to ever love her for herself.  Her life takes a turn for the better when Jason and Kendrick of Artane, two handsome brothers who don't mind what she looks like.  The only thing that really bothered me about this story was the overuse - EXTREME overuse - of the word &quot;visage&quot;.  It was used practically on every page, sometimes twice on a page.  However, I enjoyed the characters and found myself wishing that this story had been a book, instead, so that the characters and relationships could've gotten more developed.  <br />An Interrupted Tapestry by Madeline Hunter - Giselle, a noblewoman, goes to Andreas, a rich German merchant who she knew years before, in the hopes of getting a loan for him.  She needs the money to save her brother, the same person who has made her family so bankrupt.  Giselle's devotion to her brother was annoying.  Andreas' love for her made no sense, since she constantly clawed at him for &quot;causing&quot; her family's financial distress because he was the one to lend her brother all that money.  This story was a headache.<br />Dragonswan by Sherrilyn Kenyon - Sherrilyn Kenyon was the reason why I picked this book up.  I had just finished reading one of her books and found out that she had a short story in this book.  In this story, a scholar named Channon is interrupted during her study of a mysterious tapestry.  She feels drawn to him, as he is drawn to her, but he can't stay in her time.  There are too many dangers for his kind in the modern world.  Whereas (as far as I know), Sherrilyn Kenyon's books seem to mainly deal with vampire-like beings, this story featured shapeshifters.  While I liked this story, I felt like it was a bit rushed.  I wish it could've been a been, instead of a short story.  <br />Into the Dreaming by Karen Marie Moning - Aedan has been tortured by the Unseelie king for so long that he no longer remembers who he is.  However, the spell that binds him can be broken if, during the one month that he is allowed to live back in the mortal world without the king's influence, he can love and be loved.  The Seelie queen decides to try and help Aedan by sending Jane Sillee back to his time.  Aedan has been in Jane's dreams for as long as she can remember, and she's determined to save him.  This, I think, is one of the funnier stories in the book.  I can't help but think that Jane's determination to contine writing romance novels while in Aedan's time will bankrupt him.<br />Mostly this book is worth a read, although maybe not a reread.  Usually, I find romantic short stories to be too short - they always seem to me to suggest longer books - and the stories in this book aren't really exceptions.	2003-07-02
US	42442234	R6VBPSM3JFLYO	0786817070	442293804	Artemis Fowl (Artemis Fowl, Book 1)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	very recommended	I'd heard of this book before, but I didn't get around to finding and reading it until recently.  The writing style has a feel to it that reminds me a little of Harry Potter, but Artemis is no Harry.  Artemis is a twelve-year-old genius and criminal mastermind.  He has a plan to restore his family's fortune - capture a fairy and steal its gold.  That fairy ends up being Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon Unit.  Humans aren't supposed to know as much about fairies as Artemis does, and this kidnapping has the potential for causing a human/fairy war.  At first, I wasn't sure if Artemis was at all likeable, but, as the story progresses, I discovered that, underneath his shrewd coldness, Artemis is still a child.  Artemis' bodyguard, Butler, was also interesting, and I thought Butler's little sister, Juliet, the pro-wrestling loving teenager, was pretty funny.  I can't wait to get my hands on the next book.	2003-07-02

By this I mean that the art doesn't always make what is going on very clear.  Also, I have yet to understand what makes vampires and shinma very different.  Miyu makes a distinction, but I don't think it's ever explained very well.  I did enjoy reading the part about how Miyu became what she is, however, and the art is very nice, even if it's sometimes confusing.	2003-07-02

The things that happen in this book are almost exactly the same as the things that happened in the movie - I was impressed that it could be this accurate and still be such a short book.  There are a few things in the book that weren't in the movie at all, such as, at the beginning, parts that explain what it was like for Cyclops and Storm when they first got their powers.  That was nice.  Still, it felt like this book managed to leech all the excitement out of the story.  It was a faithful book, but not a very fun one.	2003-07-02
US	42442234	R2Z3TJZY3Y0WQ1	1587242214	909224595	Once More With Feeling	Books	3	5	5	N	N	okay, but not great	Raven is a famous singer and Brandon is a charming musician.  They'd once been in a relationship, but Brandon left.  Raven assumed he'd left because she hadn't wanted to have sex with him, but that wasn't really the case.  When Brandon comes back five years later, he wants to try to resume their relationship.  Raven resists, but resistance becomes more difficult after they team up to come up with the score for a much anticipated musical.  However, for their relationship to last this time around, Raven has to learn to share the more vulnerable side of herself with Brandon.  Although I did enjoy this book as a quick read, with occaisional parts that made me smile, nothing about it really grabbed me.  Brandon and Raven were both interesting, they weren't really characters that would stick around with me for a while.  Also, I got tired of Raven's inability to share any of the really important parts of her life with Brandon.  I don't see how she expected them to get into a serious relationship and stay that way without some sharing going on.  Even with her lack of relationship experience, I still felt like she should've noticed that she was holding back things from him and not acted like every problem with their relationship was Brandon's fault.  Although this isn't too bad a read, I would recommend picking up one of Nora Roberts' other works more - The MacGregor Grooms is good, as is The Stanislaski Brothers.	2003-06-18
US	42442234	R3OFGXC5XN2E3E	0312979983	76852490	Night Pleasures (Dark-Hunter, Book 2)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	great read	I'd never read any of Sherrilyn Kenyon's books before I picked this up, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this book was.  After reading the back, I was expecting vampires and something a little more like Christine Feehan's stuff, although maybe with a little more humor.  I'm not too big a fan of Feehan's books, so I was a little worried, but I started the book anyway and boy did I have problems stopping.  The way this world that Kenyon created works is a bit complicated, and I still can't remember all of it, but basically all you need to be able to keep in mind is Dark-Hunters.  They're people who used to be humans.  When they died, either something that was before their death or caused their death was so painful for them that their souls cried out to the gods.  Their cries are answered, and they're given the opportunity to take revenge on those who caused them this pain, but only for a price - they have to give up their souls and spend the rest of their immortal (or nearly so) lives hunting down Daimons.  Both Daimons and Dark-Hunters could be mistaken for vampires, because of the things they can do, their immortality, and their fangs.  Daimons need to feed off of human souls in order to continue to exist.  Dark-Hunters, as far as I can tell, can almost live like regular people, except for the fact that their eyes are sensitive to light and they'd die if they went out in to the sun.  Daimons can't exist in sunlight either.  If you know a little biology, you may, like me, have some problems with Dark-Hunters eating normal human food while at the same time having fangs (it's physically impossible for the jaws to move sideways while chewing when there's fangs in the way, so they'd have to look awfully funny while eating), but I got over it.<br />Kenyon has a definite sense of humor, which I enjoyed, and I thought the characters themselves were pretty interesting.  It didn't always seem like Amanada was a very consistant character(Kyrian often thought of her \\"gentle voice\\", especially near the beginning, although it didn't seem to me like there was much that was very gentle about her at the beginning - mostly, all I saw in her was annoyance and fear.  That gentleness that Kyrian loved came later.).  However, the humor in the book, as well as many of the other characters, made up for that.  Although I think the next book is about Talon, I'm really looking forward to a book about Acheron - I can't wait for that one to get written.	2003-06-18

It helped that there was a short section explaining who all the characters are, as well as a section explaining what's happened in the previous volumes.  The storyline was interesting.  I'm looking forward to finding out what happens next, with the Mikage International story as well as with Aya's relationships (I've never thought romantic storylines were inherently bad, and at least the other storylines are there to provide some balance).  In this volume, Aya has to deal with relationship issues with Yuhi as well as Toya.  Also, she finds out there's another celestial power nearby.  I liked the artowrk, although there was often a tendency, when a person's hair had fallen over one eye, for the somewhat covered eye not to be drawn in any way.  It looked kind of odd, like the person was missing an eye.  Still, the artwork was very nice.  I also like the artist/author's comments - occaisionally, she had little panels on the side where she'd talk about creating Ceres, her own thoughts on how Ceres works (there's a simplistic explantion of genetics and DNA at one point, although it's not much more, and probably less, than what you'd find out in a high school biology class).  She sounded like an interesting person to meet.	2003-06-18

This was definitely the case with this book.  Zoe, a practical single mother, agrees to help her best friend and her daughter to summon a djinni.  Despite Zoe's skepticism, the spell works, and Simon the djinni is bound to grant her three wishes.  Simon and Zoe are attracted to one another, but there's a lack of trust on either side: Simon has seen so much ugliness in humanity that he has trouble trusting Zoe, and Zoe has trouble trusting wishes because of the actions of her ex-husband.  I actually ended up feeling more for Simon than for Zoe.  In spite of all the reasons he had for not opening up, he actually turned out to be more willing to trust than Zoe.  Zoe's stubborness was often really annoying - she didn't want to open up to her friends/business partners, and she didn't want to open up to Simon.  She was probably the most exhausting character in the book.  However, in my opinion, Simon made up for all of that, and I ended up really enjoying this book.  I usually end up reselling romance that I buy, but I think this one's a keeper.	2003-06-18

This book even has a \\"the story thus far\\" section and short explanations of the characters, for those of you like me, who need a bit of a refresher.  Those two sections would also probably be helpful for those you you who are only just starting the series, although I think it would be much more satisfying to start at the beginning.  This book starts where the previous one left off.  Inu-yasha, Kagome, and the rest are trying to defeat the false water god.  After that, Miroku ends up with problems involving his curse - if those problems are not dealt with, he will die.  Then, to make things more difficult for everybody, Naraku has resurfaced and is using Sango's weaknesses against her.  As ususal, the storylines were interesting and the artwork was great.  Defnitely recommended.	2003-06-18

Once again, there's a \\"the story thus far\\" section and a section explaining the main characters, just in case you need a refresher.  I thought this particular volume was a lot of fun.  We get to see that Naraku has something to fear from Kagome.  There's also a storyline with a half-breed (demon father, human mother) named Jinenji - I thought his crush on Kagome was kind of cute.  Also Kikyo is back, although she's the more demonic Kikyo we saw several volumes ago.  The whole series is fun to read, and this book is no exception.	2003-06-18

The first thing that I really noticed was the artwork - the people in this have the biggest eyes I have ever seen in anything, manga or anime.  Even the main \\"heart throb\\" character has large eyes, framed by eyelashes that would make most girls jealous.  I decided to ignore all that and give this a try anyway.  I almost didn't finish it, because I couldn't understand what Kira (a shy student who's good at art) could possibly see in Rei (the heart throb I mentioned).  Granted, this is the first book in this series that I've read, but it's only book two, so you'd think there'd still be redeeming bits of his character showing through.  Instead, he spends much of the book either not caring about anything or beating people up.  I might keep up with this series, just because there were hints that Rei was going to change, but so far it doesn't look too promising.	2003-06-12

That can be pretty confusing, if you're not used to it, but it gets easier to deal with after a while.  No, my problems are with the story itself: I had problems following what was going on a lot of the time.  This could be because I haven't read volume one or two yet, and I've never seen any of the anime.  Still, most of the time I was reading this, I felt like the writer wanted to make things seem mysterious and ended up making things incomprehensible instead.  I would've appreciated it if there had at least been a little section at the beginning explaining who the characters were.  I think I figured that out okay after a while, but I still got confused a lot.  I think it was all the really big panels with no dialogue but a lot of really pretty art - they were lovely, but they didn't always seem to show too clearly what was going on.	2003-06-12

I've only read two other volumes, the first and the second.  The first volume confused me utterly, because it doesn't start in a way that's very good for people who have never seen the series before (the &quot;series explanation&quot; is more confusing than enlightening).  However, since that first volume, I've gotten to like these books much more.  The art's great, and occaisionally there are some really funny moments.  This book has some more Minagi scenes, which I thought was great since she's one of my favorite characters at this point.  And, since I gather from the other reviews I've read that Minagi probably wasn't in the original series, I'll just say that she's sort of a second Ryoko, with a different personality.  A good read.  I recommend it, but it would probably be good to read one of the earlier books first, so that things aren't so confusing.  That's this series biggest problem, I think.  It isn't always very clear about things, and there's never a little section at the beginning explaining who all the characters are, like you see in other manga series.	2003-06-12

I liked Minagi, and Yakage's story was interesting.  I also thought the part near the end where Mihoshi was learning to drive was hilarious.  Makes me feel a little better about my own learning-to-drive experiences.  &lt;g&gt;  Although it's probably a good idea to read the first volume before trying this one, I think this volume is a lot better.  It's much less confusing, and the characters are great.	2003-06-12

This book starts with what I think is a many page explanation of everything that's happened before the events of the beginning of this volume.  Since this is the first volume, as far as I know, I guess that means that this is an explanation of things that happened in the series.  I've never seen any of the series, something which I think crippled my enjoyment of this book.  The explanation at the beginning seemed like it should have helped, but all it did was confuse me more.  I had a hard time keeping track of who all the characters were, what they were, and why they were there.  The rest of the book didn't explain that all for me either.  I spent a lot of time vaguely interested, but mostly confused.  So, if you've never heard of this before or you've never seen the series, then this is probably not the book for you.	2003-06-12

I didn't know who Urd was, and there wasn't anything at the beginning of the book that explained things for me, so I was worried.  It turned out that it didn't matter - it didn't take me long to figure out who Urd was and what she was like (definitely not another Belldandy).  I'd recommend at least reading the first book before trying this, but overall I think it's pretty easy to follow, which is more than I can say for some of the other manga things I've read recently.  The first story, with the Campus Queen competition, was great, and I thought the story where Keiichi was trying to get a present for Belldandy was pretty sweet.  I loved the whole book, and I definitely recommend it.  Still, from what I've seen in the other reviews, this may not be something you'll want to get if you've been collecting Oh My Goddess comics before (lack of never-before-published comics) - but if you're like me, and only just getting started, this book is great.	2003-06-11

Vol. 2: Leader of the Pack	Books	5	1	1	N	N	more Oh My Goddess fun	I admit, I've never seen any of the Oh My Goddess anime, and I haven't been reading these books in order, but that doesn't make reading them any less fun.  For those of you, like me, who can't manage to get all of these volumes in order, you're in luck.  Although this volume (I'm not sure about the others) doesn't have a \\"the story thus far\\" section or a section summing up the characters, it's all still easy to follow.  This book has the first appearance (I think) of Urd, Belldandy's mischievous sister.  Once again, the artwork is gorgeous, and the stories themselves are fun.  Very recommended.	2003-06-11
US	42442234	R363T6780QMT5Z	1569311943	325681898	Rumic World Trilogy, Vol. 2	Books	3	1	1	N	N	funny, but not Rumiko Takahashi's best	This volume has &quot;The Golden Gods of Poverty&quot;, all five parts of &quot;Wasted Minds&quot;, and &quot;The Enterpreneurial Spirit&quot;.  &quot;The Golden Gods of Poverty&quot; was okay, and certainly strange, but it felt very weak.  In the story, a boy named Sakae is used by his parents in an attempt to get money without any actual work.  Instead of money, they get the Seven Lucky Gods.  Unfortunately, these gods aren't very helpful.  This story and the last one were the worst in the book.<br />The parts of &quot;Wasted Minds&quot; follows the adventures of three JCIA agents.  There's Tamuro Gomi, who can teleport, but only from garbage to garbage, Yura Enjoji, who's really strong, and Sekoi, who is, I suppose, a regular human being.  The &quot;Wasted Minds&quot; stories are the best in this volume, showing some of the quirkiness that can be found in Rumiko Takahashi's other works.  There's also an attempt at romance, although I think that that should have been left out - it felt more like an afterthought, like it was tacked on.  These stories made me laugh, but, once again, they weren't as good as some of the author's series.  <br />The last story was about a school club trying to make money by charging people for seances.  Unfortunately for the people trying to make money, things don't go entirely as planned.  Really, that's all there is to the story - it's very short, shorter even than the first story in this volume.  I didn't think it was very interesting or very funny, and it's probably the weakest story in this volume for me.  <br />If you're a big fan of Rumiko Takahashi, you'll probably want to read this, but I don't think it's a keeper.  Personally, I think it would be better to buy another Inu-yasha volume.	2003-06-09

Most of my complaints involved wanting more - more artist commentary, more concept drawings, that sort of thing.  The book has an introduction written by Hayao Miyazaki, a section with concept sketches, a section with concept sketches, backgrounds, and character designs, and a section explaining how computer graphics were used in the movie.  This book even has the movie's screenplay.  I really enjoyed the concept sketches, which show how original ideas changed to create the final product.  For instance, a sketch of Zeniba and Yubaba shows how much Zeniba's design changed - she looks more normally proportioned than her sister.  Later in the book, there is an explanation for why the change in Zeniba's design occurred.  I also enjoyed the computer graphics section, because I would never have noticed any of the things they pointed out on my own.  I foudn it fascinating, they way they blended cel art and digital art so well.	2003-06-09

I didn't like the black and white drawings as much, which is why I don't think the artwork deserves a 5, but the paintings are excellent.  The drawings didn't always look much like the characters from the show.  For instance, the drawings of Anya hardly ever looked like her.  The paintings, though - some of them looked almost looked like photographs, put through photoshop filters or something.  Very nice.  I found myself wishing that some of the BtVS comics could look that good.<br />Now, the story.  It takes place during one of those bleak times in the series - after Buffy died for the second time, before the musical.  Willow and Tara have some rough relationship moments because of Willow's overdependence on magic, and it's this problem that starts the monster troubles in this book.  Buffy's still trying to get over the fact that she was torn out of heaven, Dawn is doing her best to become a deliquent, and Spike loves Buffy.  Oh yeah, Xander and Anya are having relationship disagreements as well while they plan their wedding.  Basically, this book doesn't tell you anything about the series or characters that you don't already know.  This wouldn't necessarily be a bad this, if the story had been better.  I didn't think the story was all that interesting, and it was only because the book was so short that I managed to get all the way through it at all.  I would recommend this book for the art, but the story isn't worth it.	2003-06-09

Although I haven't read all the Oh My Goddess books, I still had fun with this.  I would like to find some of the other books, so I can find out how Skuld became a part of the group (that's a volume I missed).

I wasn't sure whether to give this a 3 or a 4, but I gave it a 4 because it really was interesting enough that I got through it quickly (if something takes me a while to read, it's either very long or not very interesting).  Yota is still dealing with relationship problems, only now his problems don't involve the word &quot;dateless&quot;.  In fact, he's got way too many women in his life.  There's Moemi, Nobuko, and Ai.  Yota's dating Nobuko, but he still loves Ai, and he's still got feelings for Moemi.  It makes his life pretty complicated.  The reason I was wondering if I should give it a 3 was because I'm getting to the point in this series where I think every one of these characters just needs a break from each other - or maybe just from Yota.  It's hard to believe that he could go from being the guy with the nickname &quot;Dateless&quot; to the guy that every girl wants to have.  This book still was a pretty good read, but I don't think I'm going to be continuing with this series anytime soon.	2003-06-08

When her parents are turned into pigs, Chihiro has to depend on the help of a strange and mysterious boy named Haku. I'd never read in the Japanese right-to-left format before, so I had a little bit of trouble at first, but it's not too bad once you get used to it.  Everything is read from right to left, not just where you start in the book, but also which speech bubble you start with and what side of the page.  I haven't seen the film yet, but, after reading this, I'm really looking forward to seeing it.  I liked Haku the most, although Chihiro got more interesting as the story progressed.	2003-06-01
US	42442234	R3CURF6MWTCZ2E	1569715696	669612464	Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Oz	Books	2	4	6	N	N	didn't seem at all like Oz	The Oz in this book didn't really seem like the Oz from the show, as another reviewer pointed out quite well.  Not only did he not seem to think like himself, he didn't look like himself either, and I had a lot of trouble remembering, as I was reading, that this was a book about Oz.  With other comics I read, the art isn't as huge an issue for me, but with a comic based on a show I like, I was expecting the two characters from the show (Oz and flashbacks of Willow) to look more like themselves.  I've seen BtVS art that was really accurate before, so I was expecting better than what I got with this book.  Also, from the few details I got from the show about Oz's journey to take control over the werewolf, I always figured it'd be a really internal thing.  In the show, Oz was never really a big fighter anyway, which made the fight scene in this comic odd.  I don't think it was necessary to find a way to get a fight in this book - I've seen comics where most of the action was internal, and many of those were done very well.  I wish it had been that way with this one.	2003-06-01

I only really got interested in them once I saw the movie.  I read this book after reading the Daredevil:The Movie comic collection.  The first comic in this book was also in that one, so the repetition is kind of a disappointment.  However, it's nice to get the rest of the story.  In this book, Matt and Elektra are both at college.  They meet and they fall in love, but then Elektra starts to want to get revenge on a guy who hurt a friend of hers.  I thought the artwork in this book was great, and the story was interesting.  I don't know if a big fan of the Daredevil comics would like it, but I enjoyed it a lot.  After the main story, there are a few pages from Salvador Larroca's sketchbook, showing how he came up with the design for a younger Elektra and her costumes.  I liked those pages too - they gave a nice (but not really very detailed) look into some of the thought process behind the story.  The final part of the book is a bonus comic featuring Maya Lopez (Echo), a woman with birth-induced deafness who can watch any action and commit it to muscle memory.  In other words, she can watch someone fight or play a piano and do exactly as they did.  I liked the comic, and I'll do my best to try and find the book in which that story is continued.  Overall, I definitely recommend this book.	2003-06-01
US	42442234	R10A2BC6DMWRA2	0759203180	414949399	The Prince of Midnight	Books	4	8	8	N	N	very good, unexpected	This seemed like it was going to be a very strange book and, in some ways, very unlike any other romance I've read.  There's a former swordsman named S. T. Maitland who's half-deaf and loves to love and be loved, S. T.'s pet wolf who's afraid of women, and Leigh Strachan, a woman who's disguised herself as a man and wants to learn to use a sword so she avenge her family.  In an odd sort of role reversal, it's Leigh who wants nothing to do with love and emotions, and S. T. who wants love (although mostly he wants a willing bedpartner).  One thing that I noticed about this book that was really different from any other romance I've read was the point of view from which it was told.  Most romance novels I've read mainly show things from the woman's point of view, with occaisional passages or chapters from the man's.  In this book, that was reversed.  It isn't even until the fourth chapter that you get to see anything from Leigh's point of view, or know her actual thoughts.  It was interesting, and, although I wasn't sure at first how I'd like it, S. T. was fascinating.  The only real problem I had with this book was Leigh, who was often very frusterating.  I could understand why she didn't want to open up to S. T. - I though the author got that across quite nicely.  However, I got tired of how cruel and cold she could be, and started wishing she'd just learn to trust someone a little.  It was a great story, but sometimes Leigh really made me want to scream in frusteration.  If I could, I think I would give this book a 4.5.	2003-06-01

Keiichi Morisato dials a wrong number and ends up magically bound to the goddess Belldandy.  The art in this book is lovely, and many of the stories are hilarious.  Belldandy is probably the nicest person/celestial being I've ever seen in a comic, and the way people reacted to her was really funny.

US	42442234	R1LV8E5BJDNZLF	1552976777	986176931	Sleep and Rest in Animals	Books	4	1	1	N	N	interesting and has great pics, but not very detailed	This book, like the title says, is all about sleep and rest in animals.  In the foreward, the author says that the meaning of \\"sleep\\" will be stretched a bit for the purposes of the book, so there's a lot of info on kinds of \\"sleep\\" that some might not consider to be sleep.  The chapter on insects is a good example of this.  I like that the author often notes areas where scientists disagree.  Still, if you're looking for detailed information on sleep in various animals (insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals), this would not be a good book for you.  The information in this book seems to be intended more to give you a general idea about sleep and rest in these animals, with occaisional interesting details.  It's a great place to start if you don't have anything specific you want to know, but it's probably not what you're looking for if you already know a lot about the subject.  However, this book does have excellent pictures, and I would recommend it just for those.  Every picture is full color, and some take up two whole pages.	2003-06-01

However, there is a &quot;the story thus far&quot; section at the beginning, plus a few brief character summaries, so if you do end up starting with this one, at least you get a little help.  When this volume starts, Yota is trying to keep Ai from disappearing forever.  Things go wrong, of course, but Ai isn't destroyed (did you really think she would be, what with the title and all?).  She doesn't seem to remember Yota, though, and there are some more complications.  Although he loves Ai, Yota still cares for Moemi, and now there's someone else who likes him. <br />The story was interesting, and the art was still lovely.  That's why this book still gets such a high rating.  However, all the further romantic complications kind of got on my nerves.  Aren't two women enough?!  With Ai's amnesia to drive him crazy, I don't think it was really necessary to add another girl (Nobuko) to the list of people Yota loves/likes too much to want to hurt.  I suppose I'm just glad that Masakazu Katsura changed Nobuko's hairstyle so that it wasn't so much like Moemi's - they looked so alike that I kept confusing them.  Anyway, it's still a good series, but I hope that there aren't too many more characters added to the mix.	2003-05-28

She was kidnapped, and the shock of her experience, as well as the drugs that were used on her, left her without any memories about herself or the people she knew.  Her father, Prince Armand, knows that she is still in danger, so he asks ex-cop Reeve MacGee to be her bodyguard until those who took her are captured.  <br />I only just finished reading Nora Roberts' _The Right Path_, and I found this book to be a relief.  Whereas _The Right Path_ didn't seem to have any real romance, this book had just enough.  The mix of mystery and romance was perfect.  Brie's amnesia was a great introduction to Cordina and the royal family: as she rediscovered them, I learned about them, too.  Reeve was great, although not as wonderful to read about as some of Roberts' other heros (Roarke from the In Death books is, for me, a great favorite) - part of the reason why this book got a four instead of a five.  Brie, although prone to haughtiness, was very likeable, and I enjoyed reading about her and Reeve's romance.  The mystery element, \\"who kidnapped the princess?\\", was also fun, but pretty predictable.  There aren't too many possibilities for who could have done it, and I had the answer figured out quite a bit before the book ended - another reason why the book got a four.  I'm not usually very good at solving mysteries, so I figure this must have been a pathetically easy one to figure out.  However, this is mostly a romance, not a mystery.  This is still a highly enjoyable read, and I definitely recommend it.	2003-05-28

She doesn't think her abilities are a very big deal, although she is careful to hide them from others.  Still, she uses them mainly to keep boredom at bay.  Unfortunately, a secret organization is after her and other psychokinetics, so that they can use her for military purposes.  Her dad, a man skilled at martial arts, as other ideas, however, and does his best to keep her safe.  <br />The artwork in this book was unexpected for me, much more realistic than anything I've seen in other manga works.  However, it wasn't consistantly good artwork, and some of the characters tended to look odd, as another reviewer noted.  The story itself was very riveting, and I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read more about Mai, and I'm looking forward to the next volume.	2003-05-27

I really enjoyed the section story, and I thought the last one was pretty interesting, although a bit depressing.<br />The first story, the comic adaption of the movie, was basically a very abridged version of the movie.  Many of the scenes in the movie were cut out, which was understandable, considering the amount of space that was devoted to this part of the book.  This comic was only two, maybe three times longer than the other three comics.  Considering the title of the book, I expected the entire thing to be just a comic version of the movie - I wasn't expecting the other three stories.  Because of how cut-down the movie story is, some parts of the plot are pathetically developed.  The relationship between Matt and Elektra, for instance, seems to come up out of nowhere.  Sometimes it's hard to understand what's going on, and I'm just grateful I saw the movie before reading this.<br />The second story focuses mainly on Elektra.  There's a lot about some of her deepest friendships during a year at college, as well as how she first got to know and start dating Matt.  Her relationship with Matt was really sweet, and I liked reading about her interactions with her friends.  The main point of conflict in this story is the fact that Elektra and one of her friends keeps embarassing soem guy, who gets pushed more and more to retaliate.  The only thing I didn't like was that this story ended with &quot;Continued in Ultimate Daredevil Trade Paperback&quot;.  I really wanted to read more.<br />The second story is about some police investigations into various criminals, including the Kingpin and his son.  Daredevil and his secret identity are brought into the conversation.  Mostly, I found this story to be confusing and boring.  Mostly boring, since I eventually got over my confusion.  Since I don't regularly read Daredevil comics, Ihad a somewhat difficult time following some of the cops' discussions about characters I didn't know.  It didn't really feel like very much happened.<br />The last story follows the last hours of one of the Kingpin's men, when he realizes that his botched work will lead to his execution at his boss's hands.  I thought this one was very well done, and it, along with the second story are the best parts of this book.<br />Overall, the artwork was very nice, but I think this book could have been much better if the people who put it together had focused on one thing or another, rather than jumping from comic to comic.  In fact, because of the title, I think they should have just done a book-length comic adaptation of the movie.  The adaptation that they actually did not do anything justice.	2003-05-27

He is an Altan serf, so the law does not require that he be cared for even as well as a slave and there is no chance that he would ever be freed.  However, he gets lucky, and a Jouster takes him to become is dragon-boy.  Jousters are warriors who ride dragons.  These dragons are not like Anne McCaffrey's dragons, or Lackey's Companions - they are wild and, without the tala that keeps them somewhat sedate, they would kill their riders and those who care for them and fly away.  Vetch's new job is to care for the dragon of the Jouster who took him, but this dragon is different.  He needs no tala, and seems to genuinely care for his rider.  <br />Because I recognized elements of the plot from other things I've read, I was expecting to hate this book.  I expected it to be more like some of Lackey's recent books: boring and maybe a bit preachy (not religion preachy, but more \\"a person cannot be even slightly lazy or they are bad\\" preachy - I've been feeling that the characters of her past few books have been far too perfect to feel real).  However, I found that I really liked this book and practically flew through it.  Still, most of the characters were fairly bland - I never really felt like I knew Ari, the main Jouster in this book, and none of the other characters, even Haraket, very even close to being as fleshed-out as Ari.  The ending of the book, which happened a little before I thought it would, leaves things open enough that there may be another book.  If there is, I plan on reading it.  In spite of the problems I had with it, I really did enjoy this book.	2003-05-27

Although she intends to relax, that plan is soon destroyed.  Instead, Morgan finds herself having to worry about murder and smuggling - as well as a man who may be involved with both, but to whom she still feels strangly drawn, Nicholas Gregoras.<br />This was a quick read for me, both not really an excellent one.  If I had read this before reading any of Nora Roberts other books, I probably wouldn't have sought any of those other books out.  Although we discover at one point that Morgan has fallen in love with Nicholas, there seems to be no reason why this is the case - lust, I can believe, but not love.  The first time they sleep together, Morgan is incredibly drunk and Nicholas knows it.  It's not the usual romance that I expect from Roberts.  Morgan and Nicholas' relationship isn't very spectacular; it's as though the author wanted mostly to concentrate on the mystery elements of the book and decided that, for the romance parts, passionate kisses and sex would suffice.  There wasn't a single romantic moment that made me smile, and I found myself thinking that Nora Roberts has come a long way in her writing since this book was first published (1985).  If I want to read a Nora Roberts book with well-meshed mystery and romance in it, then I'll reread an Eve Dallas book, not this.	2003-05-27

Sookie is a telepath whose life has been majorly complicated by her boyfriend, Bill the vampire.  In this book, Bill has been acting a bit distant towards her lately.  He ends up getting kidnapped, and Sookie finds out he's been cheating on her.  Still, Sookie feels obligated to save him and, in spite of the fact that she can't afford to take time off from work, goes off to do just that.  Eric (a sexy vampire who keeps trying to get into Sookie's pants), Bubba (aka a vampiric Elvis), and a werewolf are all there to help her out.  <br />I loved this book.  It's got just the right touch of humor, not too silly but not too serious.  It was nice to see more of both Eric and Bubba some more - Bubba did occaisionally seem more like a tool to solve plot problems, but that didn't make him any less interesting to read about.  Eric really shined, and I can't wait to read more about him in later books.  The ending was, I think, the best part of the book.  It was nice to see that Sookie doesn't fold when it counts.  And if that comment makes you curious, I suggest you go out and read the book.  It was definitely worth the time, for me.	2003-05-27

However, she happens to like Yota's best friend, the handsome yet uninterested Takashi Niimai.  Moemi inadvertantly crushes Yota by admitting she likes Takashi, and, a short while later, Takashi turns Moemi down.  Instead of being crushed by the revelation that Moemi likes someone else, Yota is upset that Moemi has been hurt by Takashi.  This apparently shows that his heart is pure, which allows him to find Gokuraku, a video rental place.  Yota gets what he thinks is an X-rated video.  Later, while he watches the video, a video girl named Ai pops out of the screen.  She's determined to help him get Moemi.<br />I thought the story was fun to read, although I found that Yota's obsession with various parts of the female anatomy, and how this obsession was shown (with closeups of those parts), got really old after a while.  I didn't know what to expect when I started this book, but I got through it really fast - I wanted to know how things would turn out for Yota, Moemi, and Ai.  The art was lovely, and the idea of video girls was interesting (although it's too bad that there don't seem to be any video guys in existance).	2003-05-23

Finding out who murdered Ray isn't just a justice thing - whoever murdered Ray also stole his laptop, which puts Turing and the other AIPs in danger.  Maude, Tim, and Turing's investigation takes them into unfamiliar territory: a dark, violent computer game and even live-action roleplaying (LARP).<br />I actually think this book deserves a 4.5.  It was better than the first book.  It didn't feel as bogged down by Turing and her agonizing over whether the things she was doing were morally correct.  She still analyzes herself, and several times she wonders is she's becoming Hal-like, but it didn't feel like Turing's mental dialogue was trying to take over the book.  I thought Tim and Maude were great in this book.  Tim was still trying to adjust to being a PI, and his part of the investigation led to a new addition to the group: another PI named Claudia.  Claudia was really interesting, tough and professional but still very likeable, and I'm looking forward to hearing more about her in the next book.  It'll probably help to have read the first book, since that book sets up nicely what Turing is and what she can do.  This second book also occaisionally refers to events from the first book.  However, since the series isn't too far along, I don't think starting with this book would be too confusing.  I definitely recommend this book and the series.	2003-05-23

In this volume, Yota has been searching for Ai, who disappeared at the end of the last book.  The mysterious man in the trenchcoat, Ai's creator, as decided to allow Ai to go back to Yota, with a few conditions.  Because Ai has fallen in love with Yota, something forbidden to video girls, these conditions are hard to her to follow, because they require her to put distance between herself and Yota.  <br />I really enjoyed this volume.  Yota was much more likeable, I think.  Instead of spending all his time thinking about female anatomy, he actually started to think about what and who he wanted.  Unfortunately for him, this doesn't make his life any more simple, because he realizes that what he wants is both Moemi and Ai.  My biggest complaint in this volume is Moemi, who seems content to let her feelings get stomped on by her boyfriend, Takashi.  She's like a human door mat, but this doesn't seem to diminish Yota's feeling for her any.  I found Ai to be much more likeable.	2003-05-23

I figured the book would be just as good and would tell me things the movie didn't.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the movie was much more enjoyable than the book.<br />The one thing that I can say was done well in this book is Mia's voice.  Reading her words reminds me a lot of reading things I wrote when I was that age.  Unfortunately, that was part of the problem.  Mia's so concerned with explaining why things are so horrible in her life that she becomes oblivious to other things.  And, contrary to what at least one other reviewer wrote, I don't think Mia was necessarily too pessimistic.  I think that if, in her diary, she had concentrated a great deal on the wonderful things in her life, it would've been really unrealistic.  I know that my diary was primarilly used as a venting area for all my frusterations, and secondarilly for describing my day.  That bit of realism was a problem.  I found myself wishing I could see things from another character's point of view.  Mia could be so incredibly dense sometimes.  Although early in the book she talks about her dad running a country, and later she thinks about all the special treatment she got at the airport and other places, she never seems to think that her dad is a prince.  And then there's Michael - in spite of the fact that it's obvious that he's working up to asking her out, it never occurs to Mia to think this.  I don't understand that, since even her friend, Lilly, noticed that Michael was \\"sexually harassing\\" Mia (and those are Mia's words).  I occaisionally enjoyed the story, when there was one, but Mia and her reactions were often completely unrealistic.  If I had read this book first, I think I might never have seen the movie - thankfully, both the plot and Mia herself are different in the movie.	2003-05-19

I don't usually read mystery, but I thought this sounded interesting.  The main character is Turing Hopper, an AIP, or Artificial Intelligence Personality.  When she notices that Zack, her friend and the main creator of her program, has been missing from work for several days, she gets worried.  He's not at home either.  Her worry for him prompts her to involve others, including Tim and Maude.  Both work at the Universal Library and have chatted with Turing.  Maude knows what Turing is - a program that was designed, basically, to help people with research, a program that has achieved sentience.  Tim, on the other hand, has some difficulty believing that Turing is who she says she is and not a shy redhead.  Together, the three of them uncover things that go beyond just Zack's disappearance.<br />First off, if you don't understand anything about computers, this book may be a bit difficult for you.  For example, you need to know what uploading is, downloading, chatting, instant messaging, etc.  However, you thankfully don't need to be a programmer to enjoy this book.  Andrews makes sure to explain some of the things that might be hard for the average computer user to understand, so, for the most part, the technical aspects of this book are easy to follow.  The mystery itself was captivating.  I couldn't put the book down, because I wanted to find out what Turing and her friends would uncover next.  <br />I do have one problem with the book, though, which is why is got a four and not a five.  Some of the book is from Tim's point of view, while other parts are from Maude's.  A large part of the book is from Turing's point of view.  Because Turing is a computer, she can't really interact with the physical world that much.  She can look through security cameras, but, otherwise, there are lots of descriptions of her hacking into things or looking through data.  Occaisionally, it got a little boring.  Also, Turing spent a lotof time agonizing over herself - was she behaving in what humans would consider an ethical way, how does one go about having a sense of humor, etc.  This sort of thing helped her seem more human, not less, and it was interesting, to a point.  However, after a while of this, I found myself wishing that the author had written less of this book from Turing's point of view.  <br />In spite of this, I do really recommend this book.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book.	2003-05-19

For instance, I liked Laura Kinsale's essay &quot;The Androgynous Reader: Point of View in the Romance&quot;.  She argued that the reader of a romance novel doesn't neccessarily identify only with the heroine, but also with the hero, maybe even moreso with the hero.  It made me reconsider why I was so unhappy with the books that never explained the hero's point of view very well.  The essays in this book cover a lot of things, like virginal heroines and alpha males, and the &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending that's so important for romances.  At least a couple of the writers made comparisons between the mystery genre and the romance genre, something that I thought was interesting.  I didn't always agree with what the essays were saying, but, for the most part, I enjoyed reading them.  <br />That said, it seemed that there wasn't a great deal of communication between the various authors in this book.  If there had been, there would, hopefully, have been less repetition of ideas.  There's a great deal of overlap between the essays, and the mystery vs. romance bit is only one example - most essays talk about the alpha male, the ways that romance writers were once asked to change their writing and how those changes would've hurt the genre, the type of feminism in romance, etc.  Im just glad that the book was short, and a relatively quick read, or the repetition would've been much more aggravating than it was.  Also, I'm not entirely sure that this book would reach the sort of audience that the introduction mentioned: people with biases against the romance genre.  I was once a part of that group,  and I don't think I would have picked up this book - it took reading a really good romance, recommended to me by a friend, to change my mind about romance.	2003-05-16

However, I really like Alias, so I thought I'd try this out.  It was an incredibly quick read for me and, for the most part, enjoyable, even if nothing much happened.  The first half of the book consisted of Sydney being shy, wanting a job, and wanting a boyfriend.  It isn't until the second half of the book that she actually becomes part of what she thinks is the CIA, and only in the last quarter of the book is there any action.  It was interesting to see the shyer and more insecure side of Sydney, but I got a little tired of it after a while.  There's only so much \\"I'm not really all that special\\" and \\"That guy is cute but I'm too shy to talk to him\\" that I can stand.  I found myself wishing that this book had either been written as something meant for adults, or even that it had been written under the assumption that the intended audience (young adults, which seems, to me, to cover a huge range of ages) is capable ofcontinuing to read a book with a more complex plot and less heavy-handed characterization.	2003-05-03

This is pretty sad, since I'm one of the poets whose work is in this volume, but I don't recommend getting this.  The price is insane when you consider the quality of the poems inside and the quality of the volume itself.  For that price, and the fact that none of the poets were paid (in fact, we were given the option of paying for a few extra things, instead), this should have been a much nicer looking book.  The cover feels a bit like cardboard.  I don't know how many poems are in this book, but it's got to be at least 1000, and only a few of them are actually any good (which is why I've got a two star rating instead of a one - there are a few really good poems, just not many in comparison to the total number of poems in the book).  I'm keeping the one that I bought, if only to remind myself why I never want to buy anything from these people again.  You're better off saving your money for something else.<br />Also, if you're a poet, thinking of submitting anything to them, I would advise you not to - you don't HAVE to pay them anything, but they'll try to sell you a lot.  Judging by the number of poems in this book, I really doubt that they tell anyone they won't publish their poem.  I shudder to think what a poem they WOULDN'T accept would be like.	2003-05-02

The idea behind this series is great: Carpathian males (who seem a lot like vampires, since they drink blood and have lots of amazing abilities, but are not, because they don't kill when they feed) need to find their mates, because, if they don't, they'll succumb to the darkness inside them and go on killing sprees.  Before I read this book, I imagined that the males would be strong (few romance heros aren't, after all) but vulnerable, because they know they need someone else's help.  I love reading paranormal or futuristic romance when it's done well, but, in my opinion, this was not.<br />In the beginning, I was cheering, because I thought Savannah was going to take Gregori down a notch or two.  I could definitely understand her desire not to be controlled by him, and it seriously annoyed me that he didn't seem to understand that taking over her actions and making her do things was a problem.  Although I didn't like the first sex scene, which was definitely a rape scene, I understood that Gregori had gotten out of control and couldn't stop himself.  It was a relief that he felt bad about it, after.<br />However, Savannah rapidly deteriorates into Gregori's superficially independent sex toy after this.  I really don't care if she and Gregori are lifemates; that shouldn't give him permission to force her to do whatever he wants, even if he does believe it's for her own good.  However, since Savannah's own stubborness almost gets her killed several times, I suppose the author figured she had to have Gregori take control, since Savannah wouldn't have lasted the whole book, otherwise.<br />I've read romance with alpha male types in them before, but nothing to this extent.  Gregori's extreme jealously didn't seem to fit well with the whole lifemate concept; he didn't want Savannah to even touch another guy, and yet he and Savannah are supposed to be lifemates, unable to feel the slightest bit of attraction for anyone else.  Did he expect that the other men might try to take Savannah for themselves?  I could buy that if the other men had been unattached Carpathians (although the rules of their race say that no other Carpathian would even consider taking someone's lifemate from them) or vampires, but humans?  Savannah would have not problems fending them off.  All that leaves me with is the impression that, not only does Gregori not trust Savannah, he also doesn't want her to have a social life.  Having a lifemate sounds pretty dismal to me.<br />I could probably say a lot more about the content of the book, but I think I'll move on to the actual writing now.  By the end of the book, I was tired of so many different phrases and scenes.  Christine Feehan is probably the most repetitive and heavy-handed writer I have ever read.  Gregori's eyes were always \\"molten mercury\\" and everything about Savannah was described with either the word \\"silk\\" or \\"satin\\".  And, of course, every time Savannah walked into a room, she captivated everyone with her beauty.  I found myself wishing that someone would say \\"wow, that is one ugly lady\\", just for a change.  I felt like the author was trying to beat her readers over the heads with these things, just in case we didn't get it the first two or three times.<br />After reading this book, I have a new appreciation for the paranormal romance that I've read and liked.  This book was not what I'd call a romance, since it had few romantic scenes - it's really more of a paranormal sex book.  There are vampires, and vampire-like people, humans who are either cruel or vaguely petlike, and lots of sex.  I think I might be weak and read another book in these series, mainly because it bothers me that so many people think these books are good - I keep thinking that there has to be a reason, and I'd like to find out what it is that I'm missing.test bit of attraction for anyone else.

Judd Turner lived his college years looking nothing like a hunk.  Unfortunately for him, he was in love with Lucy Walker, who happened to be dating a hunk.  After college, Judd became a P.I. and revised his image.  He's looking forward to going to his 10-year reunion and showing off his new sexy self to Lucy, who he still thinks about.  It's too bad he's got to lose the sexy look in order to bust Lucy's fiancee for embezzlement...  One of the things I really liked about this book was that Lucy was attracted to Judd even when he looked overweight and nerdy.  There were a few scenes that were really hilarious.  This is one of the best stories I've ever read in a Harelquin Duets book, and I recommend reading it.<br />The second story, _The Husband Hotel_, is not nearly as good.  Jay Overman, the inventor of the Impeccabra (a really good bra), has been given the job of keeping likely suitors away from Tara Patterson by her father.  Her father believes she's the manager of the hotel in order to find herself a husband, and he doesn't want her to get married until she's 30.  I couldn't like Jay, because, out of embarassment at being known as the Bra Prince, he tended to overcompensate with \\"manliness\\".  I wouldn't have been surprised if, at some point in the book, he started grunted, bared his teeth at any males present, and dragged Tara off by her hair.	2002-09-28

In this book, the baby is a vital part of the story, but I still don't like the story any better.  <br />Devon Clarke, author of the immensely popular column \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", is a fraud.  She knows nothing about babies.  Unfortunately, two fans of hers, a couple who'd applied her advice to their own child, die, and they leave their baby to Devon.  I thought this was a bit strange and contrived, since this couple had no way of knowing what kind of person Devon was or even what she looked like, since she never did interviews.  Anyway, Colin O'Reilly, Devon's new carpenter, helps her out with the baby.  She needs that help not only because she's miserably bad with the baby, but also because someone is causing accidents to happen around Devon, in order to make it look as if she can't properly care for the baby.  On top of all of that, Devon needs to do her first tv interview, and she needs to produce a baby and a husband, fast.  She's got a baby, so she figures all she needs to do is convince Colin to pretend to be her husband.<br />I never really liked Colin that much.  He seemed to be pretty much against everything Devon did or decided to do.  The romance between them was a little forced, especially since, if I were Devon, I would've been too mad about the way Colin was acting to even get around to romance.  Then again, Devon wasn't too brilliant either, digging herself into a deeper hole with her lies by actually using Colin as the \\"husband\\" she'd made  up and even going so far as to create a fake video tape of their wedding.  Any normal person would've just ended up admitting that they'd made the whole \\"perfect wedding, perfect husband, perfect child\\" thing up.	2002-09-28

Leila, the Djinn who we first saw in Darius' book, is back in this one.  She wants a child, but the Djinn aren't particularly fertile.  However, she's noticed that both the male Djinn who'd taken human women as wives had had children by them pretty quickly.  Leila's plan is to seduce a mortal male and then dump him after she's gotten what she wants.  She's chosen Jack (the brother of Isis, also from Darius' book), because he's a genius and not bad at all in the looks department.  Unfortunately for her, Jack's violently against magic and has created a device to disrupt magic used on him.  It has effects he hadn't planned on, and the two of them end up in an area of Kaf (the home of the Djinn) where Leila hadn't planned on taking them.  What's worse is that, although Leila didn't have much magic before, she doesn't seem to have any now....<br />There were parts of this book that I absolutely loved.  Finally there's a human who the Djinn have to be wary of!  Also, when she wasn't pouting and behaving like an overly pampered princess, I really liked Leila too, which surprised me since I really disliked her in the last book.  Then there was Zayne, a Djinn who definitely sparked my interest.  I'm guessing we'll be seeing more of him in the next book in this series.  It was nice to see Darius and his pupil again.  However, this story just didn't feel as exciting as the other two books.  Xerxes wasn't that great a villain, and I got bored a few times with Leila and Jack's interaction with one another.  Then there was the fact that, although I understood that it was awful for Leila to have no magic and that she hated being thought of as weak all her life because she had so little magic, I got tired of hearing about it after a while.	2002-09-28

Lisa Bingham's _Call of the Wild_ was really more silly than funny and Nellie, the gorilla, has more romantic dates than Alana, the main female character in the story, but, for the most part it was okay.  I have the feeling that people who know more about gorillas than I do would cringe at reading the story, but the tension between Alana and Jake was fun to read.  Susan Peterson's _Everything But Anchovies_ was my favorite of the two stories, although even it had its problems.  Josh, the handsome supercop, gets partnered with Quinby, a rookie who keeps messing up and who has an incredibly long resume.  Quinby was great and I loved Josh, but it felt like Peterson had some problems with Harlequin's page number restrictions.  For example, it's mentioned that Josh's ex-wife wants to take their son far away from him, something which bothers Josh a great deal, but this issue is never actually resolved.  It felt like the son was only in the story in order to cause a little temporary tension in Josh and maybe to add a cuteness factor.	2002-08-28

This is definitely another excellent book by Tamora Pierce.  With the help of Numair, a powerful mage, her friends, and the badger-god, Daine learns how to control her ability to communicate with animals and how to trust people again.  Daine's abilities are especially useful as more Immortals, creatures (like ogres and Stormwings) long thought to be the stuff of stories, find their way into the human world.  Pierce doesn't reveal everything about Daine right away and it was fun to watch those mysteries unravel.  Cloud, Daine's horse, is, like Faithful from the Alanna books, a smart and often witty animal.  I recommend this book, even if you haven't read the Alanna books.  Although it helps to have read them, and it's wonderful to read about all those characters from the Alanna books again, it's not really necessary in order to understand this book.	2002-08-28

The average stories were just too predictable.  Usually they ended with someone turning into a gargoyle, or there was a gargoyle protector killing people, things like that.  I was really excited about finding this anthology, because I recognized a lot of authors I liked in it: Neil Gaiman, Katherine Kurtz, Jane Yolen, Jo Clayton, Charles de Lint.  Unfortunately, most of the stories weren't nearly as good or as original as I had thought they'd be.  I enjoyed Charles de Lint's &quot;May This Be Your Last Sorrow&quot; the most, but the rest was really just so-so.	2002-08-23

In this book, Alanna is nearing the end of her training to be a knight.  Duke Roger becomes even more of a danger.  Alanna also becomes increasingly aware that, although she soon won't have to lie to people anymore about the fact that she is a girl, she doesn't know anything about being a girl.  Not only is George Cooper, the King of Thieves, interested in her, but Prince Jonathan, her friend, is as well.  <br />This was a quick read for me; I finished it in a day.  It was a wonderful book and I'm just glad that I already have the next two in my possession.  Alanna is a fascinating character, and I can't wait to find out how her story ends.	2002-08-23

In this books, Alanna ends up becoming the first female shaman of one of the desert tribes after she kills their original shaman in self defense.  Prince Jonathan comes to the tribe because there's a way to make all the desert tribes follow him when it's his time to rule.  Although I still love reading about Alanna and she's still the strong, take-charage character I enjoyed from the beginning, I felt she became too much of a sorceress in this book.  It was an interesting side of Alanna, and I enjoyed the book's plot, but I missed the Alanna from previous books, who used magic only when she really had to.	2002-08-23

Eve's best friend, Mavis, is a suspect. As if that weren't bad enough, Eve also has to work on her wedding plans and her increasingly clearer memories of what her father did to her as a child.<br />Although this is not my favorite book in the series, I still enjoy it and have read it several times. I would suggest reading the first two books in the series before reading this one, simply because Eve and Roarke's relationship is developed over time and skipping those books also skips that development. Also, because I know that these books are located in the mystery section of bookstores, I'll also add that the relationships between characters in these books are as important, if not more so, than the mystery elements. I myself enjoyed the mystery in this book, but I know there are some people who feel it's too predictable. It wasn't too predictable for me, but the reason I reread this book is not for the mystery, but for Eve's relationships with her friends and with Roarke.

US	42442234	R2KFYE03HPLOJW	0425150984	203707661	Glory in Death	Books	5	28	31	N	N	great series	In this book, someone's slashing the throats of prominent and successful women.  Since the suspects include family friends of Lieutenant Eve Dallas' commander and Eve's lover, Roarke, this becomes a very difficult case for her.<br />If you haven't read the first book, Naked in Death, I would suggest that you do that first, although this early in the series it's not as important.  Just as a warning for those who have never read one of the In Death books, the mystery is not really the most important part in the book.  I've heard regular mystery readers complain that they were able to figure out who committed the murders long before anyone in the books did.  That wasn't the case for me - I enjoyed the mystery element in this book - but the relationships are the reason why I keep reading the series and why I reread all the books.  In this book, Eve has to deal with her problems with commitment in her relationship with Roarke.  The way Eve and Roarke interact is wonderful, and Eve's gradual attempts at making herself more than just a cop are interesting reading.  I definitely recommend this book and series to anyone who likes well done and well paced romance with mystery and murder mixed in.	2002-08-17

I was reluctant to start this series because I'd tried to read a couple romantic suspense novels by Nora Roberts and hadn't liked them enough to finish them.  I figured this would turn out to be the same.  However, I couldn't put this book down.  Because this is a series, the pace of the development of the characters is slower and more realistic than in the romance novels Nora Roberts usually writes.  It never felt like the relationship developing between Roarke and Eve was forced or tacked on.  I know some people often feel that the mystery element of the In Death books is fairly predictable, but, for the most part, I don't feel that way.  I'm not a regular mystery reader, so that may be part of it, but the mystery in Naked in Death did keep me guessing.  It wasn't, however, just the mystery in this book that kept me reading - Roarke and Eve's relationship is interesting, and both characters have things about them and their pasts that the author only hints at in this book.	2002-08-11

Although it sometimes feels a bit rushed and sketchy, the pace is, for the most part, really nice.  Alanna is a really interesting character, and I enjoyed finding out how she was going to manage to get through her years of training to be a knight without letting anyone find out she was really a girl.  It sometimes felt that the people around Alanna weren't very well developed (I especially wanted to know more about her friends), but Alanna herself was usually enough fun to read about that that didn't really matter.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book and wish I had just ordered them all and saved myself the trouble.	2002-08-11

Although Amazon.com lists the reading level as ages 9-12, this is really a great read for older readers as well.  It's about a girl named Coraline.  She's bored and explores everything in her family's new flat and outside of it.  She has quirky neighbors, parents who don't have time to play with her at the moment, and the flat has a door that opens to a brick wall most of the time.  When it doesn't, it opens to another flat, exactly like the one her family lives it.  The food is better there and everything is more interesting.  Unfortunately, her other mother and other father want her to stay there forever.<br />It's a bit predictable at times (for instance, I realized where Coraline's parents were long before she did), but the story is interesting and creepy.  It's been a while since I've read anything that put shivers down my spine like this book did.  Gaiman's voice didn't always make the story seem very creepy, but the bits where the rats are singing are definitely worth a few shivers.  Just a quick note on the cd version, though.  Although it's great hearing Gaiman read it, it might be better to get the audio cassette version of it.  That way you'd still get to hear him read it and you wouldn't have to deal with the way the book is divided up in the cd.  When I listen to a book on cd, I like it best if each track (part of the book) is short, about 5 minutes long, since you can't just stop a cd and be at that exact spot a few hours or days later.  This cd breaks up the book at each chapter, which means the tracks are each anywhere from 9 to 22 minutes long.  If you don't mind that, that's great, but I just thought I'd warn those who do mind that sort of thing.	2002-08-01
US	42442234	R21QHJZXCBGLVK	0671578162	581797213	School of Light	Books	2	5	6	N	N	wonderful idea, but a tiresome read	I love the idea behind the world in this book. In Dreamland, things are always changing according to the will of the Sleepers. One minute everyone in a town may look like they come from the Victorian Era, and the in the next the might all seem to belong on a pirate's ship. However, all of this takes a bit of getting used to. I hadn't read the first book before I read this one, and so it was hard for me to figure out what was metaphor and what was an actual physical change in the Dreamland at first. As far as the properties of the Dreamland go, the book got easier to read the further along I got. However, the only reason I finished this book is because I was on vacation and had nothing else to read. Most of the characters are so pretentious I couldn't hardly stand them, and the characters who aren't are generally not all that interesting. Juele made me want to scream in frusteration more than once. She's a follower, and continuously tries to remake herself in such a way that others will like her. ... Even though she could probably find friends who'd like her for who she is, she constantly tries to dress like the popular people and say Deep and Meaningful things about art. Also, it takes forever for the author to finally get to the plot, and it isn't even all that interesting a plot. The artists at the School of Light are all working together to make the castle look more aesthetically pleasing, and a group of those artists start to ruin everything when they decide they can handle the government better than the government officials themselves. While I loved the idea behind the setting for the book, there's a lot that could've been improved.	2002-07-29

For the most part, I enjoyed this book.  It gave me a lot of laughs.  There were a few more serious and depressing parts in the book, which I didn't mind until I got to the end.  The ending, which I'm not going to give away, is just depressing, and it's the only reason why I'm giving this book a four instead of a five.  It gave the book a really uneven feel, since I saw this as a mainly humorous read.  The ending doesn't even rate the title of dark humor.	2002-07-29

This book first follows the life of the child known only as the Rowan as she grows into adulthood. The Rowan is a powerful telepath and telekinetic and she is trained accordingly. Unfortunately, her abilities tend to set her apart from others, and she's often lonely. <br />I enjoyed the book, at least until the point where the Rowan is telepathically contacted by Jeff. It's a love at first sight situation, only the Rowan doesn't even have to see Jeff before she falls in love with him. The suddeness of her attatchment to him bothered me, especially since I didn't always like Jeff. Also, Anne McCaffrey dealt with the threat of alien invasion almost too quickly and neatly. For those reasons, I'm giving this book a four instead of a five. However, in spite of the fact that I didn't always like the second half of the book, I thought the first half was wonderful. Anne McCaffrey handles mental abilites and the impact they would have on society very well, and I enjoy reading about her telepaths more than I do anyone else's. This is definitely a worthwhile read and reread.	2002-07-29
US	42442234	R1Y2U9IR36CUTH	0312265859	52382288	Hard Eight (Stephanie Plum)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	not bad	I enjoyed this book, although I would suggest, if you're planning on buying it, to wait until the paperback comes out.  It's not much different from the usual Stephanie Plum book - Stephanie has love life problems and quirky relatives, is an inept bounty hunter, and knows many quirky Burg natives.  Oh yeah, and there's the usual car damage.  I haven't read any Stephanie Plum books in a while, which is probably why I'm not as tired of all of that as some of the other reviewers of this book seem to be.  I agree that Stephanie's ineptness is getting a bit tiring.  You'd think after seven books she would've learned something.  It's amazing that Ranger and Morelli are as interested in her as they are.  All I can think is that they must love her for her entertainment value.  The best reason to read this book is for the update on Stephanie's relationship status with Ranger and Morelli, both characters I enjoy.  I gave this book a three instead of a four because of the incredibly sudden and convinient way the author wraps up some of Stephanie's problems.  Stephanie doesn't hardly need to solve her own problems, because nature and other people will do it for her.  I hope that in the next book she runs up against something or someone that only she can deal with.	2002-07-29

I don't think that this book has the same plot as The Rowan at all, although there are a few similarities.  If you were intrigued by Afra in the first book, you'll love him in this book.  It was wonderful to find out more about him.  Damia's childhood makes for an entertaining read, moreso, I think than the Rowan's.  However, the Rowan was much more mature as a teenager and young woman than Damia.  Teenage Damia is spoiled and annoying, and it's a wonder Afra could ever put up with her.  That was one of the reasons I gave this book a four instead of a five. The other reason is that the whole Damia and Afra relationship seemed very strange.  Afra never seemed to be very upset by the fact that he was falling in love with the same person he used to babysit.  However, in spite of those two things, I really enjoyed this book.	2002-07-29

It begins with a continuation of the confrontation that began in the third book.  Kagome has been kidnapped by a pair of demons, the Thunder Brothers, but she manages to convince them that she'd be of more use to them alive than dead.  They find Inu-yasha because they want the shards of the Shikon Jewel that he has, in order to increase their own demonic powers.  In the second half of the book, Kagome is back in her own time period and trying to survive school.  Unfortunately, she can never seem to get anything done without something supernatural appearing.  Kagome has to somehow get a dead girl to find peace before the Tatari-mokke, a demon that plays with the ghosts of newly dead children, opens its eyes.  The girl will go to hell if she can't find peace before then.  The second part of the book is, I think, the first time that Kagome and Inu-yasha have ever done anything that didn't give them the possibility of recovering a shard of the Jewel.  Rumiko Takahashi handles the death of a child and the idea of learning forgiveness very nicely in that second part.	2002-06-27

In this book, Inu-yasha, Kagome, and a girl named Nazuna have to deal with Spider-Head demons.  Unfortunately, Inu-yasha's half-demon heritage gives him a secret weakness that could get them all killed.  In the second half of the book, an ogress steals the bones of Kikyo, the priestess who fired the enchanted arrow that imprisoned Inu-yasha for so many years.  The ogress wants to bring Kikyo back to life, but Kagome's existance interferes with that plan.  Inu-yasha has to try to deal with the feelings he used to have for Kikyo.  This book proves that the series isn't falling into a rut.  Inu-yasha's secret is interesting and unexpected, and I enjoyed finding out more about Inu-yasha and Kikyo's past.	2002-06-27

I'm a fan of all of the other things I've seen by Rumiko Takahashi, and this series is definitely no exception.  In each book there's a serious plot combined with just the right amount of humor.  This series isn't quite as silly as Ranma 1/2 (I always get strange looks when I try to explain that one to anyone I know). In this book, Inu-yasha and Kagome meet Nobunaga, a young man who wishes to save a princess in trouble.  The three of them end up having to battle the demon that has possessed the princess' husband and is devouring the souls of young women.  In the second half of the book, Kagome has decided she needs to go back to her time in order to study for exams.  However, demons exist even there, and this one has a shard of the Shikon Jewel.  I think this is the first book that includes a little of the incredibly gullible Hojo, and there are hints of a possible romance between Kagome and Inu-yasha.  Of course, knowing Rumiko Takahashi, that romance will be very very far in the future, but it's still fun to read about and very cute.  I would recommend reading this series in order, or you might become very confused.  This is definitely a worthwhile read.	2002-06-27

I've enjoyed the other Discworld books I've read.  Pratchett's sense of humor is wonderful and I love the parallels between the Discworld and our world.  However, even though I thought the premise sounded good when I picked this up, this book limps along and manages to be not very funny at all.<br />Pratchett mainly alternates between scenes involving Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde and scenes involving those trying to stop the heroes from reaching the gods.  The transitions between those scenes aren't very good; it's often like he decided to just stop one scene and start another.  Also, it gets easy to lose track of what the point of all of this is.  Rincewind, Captain Carrot, and Leonard are supposed to stop Cohen and the others from destroying the gods, but the book gets so caught up in building the machinery to get to the mountain and then actually using that machinery that it gets easy to forget why they are doing all of that.<br />The best part of this book is the artwork. I love Paul Kidby's illustrations.  His interpretation of Rincewind is excellent - Rincewind's expression of sheer misery is perfect.  I think Kidby is the same person who did the artwork for the Discworld calender, which I also loved.  I would recommend this book only to a die hard Discworld fan - if you're one such person, you'll probably enjoy the artwork (it's really beautiful stuff), and there are some nice Discworld details (all the varieties of swamp dragon, plus a little about each one, an illustration of a few of the Discworld gods, including their names and what they are gods of, as well as some of Leonard's notes about the inventions involved in this whole adventure).  The story, however, will be a disappointment.	2002-06-25

Darcy, a woman who wants to be a published author and is running away from a man she doesn't want to marry, ends up in Vegas.  With nearly the last of her money, she wins the jackpot on a slot machine and later ends up falling in love with the owner of the casino.  It's definitely meant to be a feel-good story - nothing bad could possibly happen to Darcy.  She's a very meek sort of person, and, in spite of what Darcy often says, I would agree with the hero of this book, Mac, that she is also pretty naive.  However, she does develop more of a backbone as the book progresses.  If you're in the mood for something sweet and not too complicated, I recommend this book.	2002-06-25

He does his usual combination of pictures and writing, but this time there's an actual story running through the entire book.  He talks about his birth, school, neighbors, relatives, vacations, and more.  A few of the pictures are in color, in the same style of coloring you can find in _The Further Blurtings of Baxter_.  One of my biggest problems with this book, and the reason why I didn't give it a 5, was the way the text and images were handled.  Often, the text pertaining to a particular picture would be found on one page and you'd have to turn the page to see the actual picture.  This delay between reading the words and seeing the image took away some of the humor.  It was also a bit confusing at first, since I kept thinking that the text on the right was referring to the image on the left.  That seems logical, but that's not always how this book was set up.	2002-06-21

I was thinking about what it was that made me think the first novel was mediocre, and I didn't come upon the answer until after I'd started on the second novel.  In every Nora Roberts book I've read so far, her greatest strengths always seem to be the way she develops the romance between the two main characters (the romance is more important than the sex).  The greater percentage of a book is told from the woman's point of view, but there's just enough from the man's point of view that you get an understanding of how his mind works.  The first novel in this book, _Reflections_, has nothing from Seth's point of view.  I didn't realize how much I missed that until I got the the second novel and got to see little tidbits of how Nickolai saw his and Ruth's relationship.  I ended up feeling like Seth wasn't really a person.  He's very one-dimensional, little more than a sharp-eyed architect who Lindsay is sleeping with.  <br />It feels like this whole two-novel book was really about two people, Ruth and Nickolai.  They're the two most interesting characters in the first novel, and their personalities practically sparkle in the second.  I don't know very much about the world of dancers and ballet, but I still enjoyed reading about it.  By the time I finished this book, I found myself wishing that the details about Ruth's childhood and the death of her parents had somehow been worked into the second novel and that the story of Seth and Lindsay hadn't been included (or at least that it had been written better).  _Dance of Dreams_ was a bit rough at times, but it was much better than _Reflections_.	2002-06-21

It's true that all the drawings in this book are in color, while the ones in _The Impending Gleam_ are not, but they're still the same pictures.  There are a few things in this book that I didn't recognize, but I don't think this book is as funny as some of Glen Baxter's other stuff.

I like dark humor, but I don't think this was very well done.  It starts with Amy and Jordan losing their jobs.  Everything goes wrong for those two, and Amy ends up in the hospital several times (once from having her head ripped off by a ghoul, once because toxins were causing the flesh to fall off her bones, and another time because a prison guard beat her up).  If you don't mind reading about characters who have one awful thing after another happen to them for no apparent reason and with very little connection to reality, then you might like this book, but I didn't.  Still, at least the things that happen to them make at least some strange sense throughout most of the book.  By the end of the book, however, things completely stop making even the slightest bit of sense.  Apparently, the author can't think of any reasons why the events at the end of the book are occuring either, because he doesn't even attempt to give one of his usual strange and unrealistic explanations.	2002-06-18

It's fairly expensive, but, if you like the Sandman series, it's a lot cheaper than buying each individual comic.  This book isn't the best in the series, but it's still very good.  It's not like most comic books.  There's no superhero intent on defeating an evil supervillain for the good of mankind.  A group of magicians want to capture Death but instead capture Dream.  He stays caged for decades, and, when he finally escapes, he has to find his tools (a bag of sand, his helm, and his Dreamstone).  <br />This first book relies too much on guest appearances made by DC characters, but Gaiman does manage to move beyond that by the eighth issue, \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\".  I really enjoyed that issue, which has the first appearance of Death.  She's the reason I started reading the Sandman series.  I'd read The High Cost of Living, and I loved the idea that Death could be a perky goth girl who you could really get to like.  Mike Dringenberg, who does the pencils for the eighth issue, does an excellent version of Sandman and Death.  I don't really like Sam Keith's version of Sandman that much, but his depictions of horrific things, like Hell, are wonderful.  I also liked \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\", in which Dream has to find his bag of sand and is getting help from John Constantine, and \\"24 Hours\\", in which Doctor Destiny has Dream's Dreamstone and is driving the world mad.  I consider both of those issues to be top horror.  It's definitely worth it to get this book.	2002-06-18

Nell and Mac were two of my favorite characters in the trilogy.  From what I'd seen of Mia, she looked like she could've been very interesting.  I was, unfortunately, disappointed by this book.  The fantasy storyline, about the things that the witches must accomplish so that evil doesn't overtake the island, seemed fairly interesting.  The battles against evil and the evil itself were occasionally a bit laughable, but I liked the buildup throughout the trilogy.  <br />The fantasy elements of the third book seemed to be interfering with the romantic elements.  There just didn't seem to be enough room for either to be handled well.  It didn't help that I had problems liking both Sam and Mia.  I started off the book hating Sam; he believed that he'd just come back to the island after ten years away from it, fight a bit with Mia, and then she'd forgive him and everything would go back to the way it was.  They'd be happy, win against the evil, and all would be well.  After a while, he gave up on that idea, and I liked him better as I learned more about his reasons for leaving.  By that time, however, I'd come to dislike Mia.  In this book, she is a hypocritical idiot.  In the previous two books, she was always telling Ripley and Nell that they had to face the things that their counterparts in the past could not.  In this book, Mia stubbornly believes that she doesn't need to do any more to fulfull her part of the legend.  As far as she's concerned, she fulfilled her part of it when she went on with her life after Sam left her, in spite of evidence to the contrary.  She won't even listen to anyone else about it, and she continuously assumes that she is capable of doing everything alone.  That got really old, really fast.  It also bothered me that Mia seemed to think that it was okay to enslave someone if it was done for love; she saw no problem with her counterpart in the past, Fire, binding a selkie to her by stealing his pelt, because Fire was in love with him.<br />I also didn't like the ending very much.  It wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't had all those rhyming spells.  A few of them here and there are fine, but there were so many in the end that it really got on my nerves.

I'm planning on taking it with me when I go to Germany in a few weeks.  The spine hasn't broken and the plastic cover hasn't torn.  It's rare that I haven't been able to find the word that I needed in this book, and the list of irregular verbs is very helpful.  I own two German-English dictionaries, and, in spite of the fact that the other one is thicker and looks more likely to be useful, I absolutely prefer this one.	2002-06-16

However, I do find them helpful in my constant search for names for the characters in the stories I write.  I picked this book up for that purpose.<br />The authors of this book surveyed many people and recieved between 30 and 150 responses for each name in the book.  The book begins with two lists, boys and girls, of personality traits and the names that supposedly make people think of those traits.  Then it has two alphebetical lists of names, their meanings, the image people said that name called to mind, and famous people with that name.  In case you're interested, the girls list is a bit shorter than the boys list.  I looked through some of the names, and I've decided it would be better to just rely on my own impressions.  I don't agree with a lot of the images that the book says the names call to mind.  Some of them are fun to read, and it's nice to browse your name and the names of friends and family for a laugh, but I don't think it's as helpful as it wants to be.	2002-06-16

US	42442234	R1AHHXWPYW40BG	0441068804	887280747	The Blue Sword	Books	5	9	10	N	N	excellent book	This is, I believe, Robin McKinley's best book.  I've read it several times and have enjoyed it each time.  Harry is an amazing character and sometimes seems beyond belief.  Although she is kidnapped for a reason unknown to her, she never questions Corlath, the king who took her from her room in the Homelander outpost, about it.  Her reaction does not, however, seem out of place.  The magic that made Corlath take Harry from the outpost is guiding her as well, and in about 8 months she goes from being a somewhat restless girl with nothing to do but attend parties and ride her pony to being a warrior capable of commanding the loyalty of an army.  <br />Through Harry, the author does an intensive exploration of the Free Hillfolk culture.  There are details about the food, the language, the way they ride their horses, and more.  It doesn't feel overdone at all.  There are a few parts of the book that are from Corlath's point of view, but mos of it is from Harry's.  It makes Corlath even more of an interesting character because you find out just enough about what he thinks of the situation (especially the kidnapping) that you don't end up hating him, but not enough for him to become as familiar as Harry.  The magic in this book was fascinating, because it's more of a curse that anything.  No one who can use it has much control over it, beyond keeping it from incinerating others on accident; it most useful in battle, but it seems to have a mind of its own.  In most books that have magic in them, magic is something you work to gain control over, and it tends to be useful for a lot of things.  Reading this book was very refreshing.  The magic users can't use their magic to solve every problem.	2002-06-15

If you don't know anything about linguistics, you might want to take a look at this book, although it would still be helpful to have someone who does know something about it around to explain some things.  The author's descriptions of what the phonetic symbols sound like don't always help very much.  The organization of this book is a bit odd; the most obvious example is that phonetics isn't discussed in detail until Chapter 5, even though the author makes use of phonetic symbols in the previous chapters.  If you read the book from the beginning to the end, you may get a little confused - reading the chapters out of order is practically a must.  Also, there are far too many examples.  I found myself skimming over a lot, because, after the first example, I understood what was being discussed and didn't need the next page or so of examples.  The charts are wonderful, though, and there are a lot of them.	2002-06-14

There are details in the artwork that you might not notice the first time around, so it's nice to take another look at it every once in a while.  I really enjoyed the story.  The reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because the artwork tends to look a little goofy at times.  The humans all have faces like wrinkled putty (Larry Talbot, on the middle of the cover is an example of this, although there are more awful looking examples in the book itself - the characters around him on the cover don't look that way inside the book).  However, the quirky artwork usually works fine with the story, and the werewolf looks wonderful.  I prefer Neil Gaiman's orignal version (just a story, not in comic book form, you can find it in _Smoke and Mirrors_), but this was nice to read and look at, even if I didn't agree with their interpretation of what Larry Talbot looks like.	2002-06-14

The spine of the book calls it a futuristic romance, but I'd actually call it a science fiction book with maybe a little more romance than usual.  The author pays a great deal of attention to the alien culture of the Changelings, the beings Selena spends a lot of time with, and to Selena's own abilities.  <br />Selena is a Branlow mutant: she has incredible telepathic abilites and heightened senses.  Her inner struggle was fascinating to read about.  Because of what she is, she needs physical contact more than most people, but she's spent her life avoiding getting close to people.  Instead of trying to get close to the people in the colony she's been taken to, she spends most of her time with the animals.  Mark Curien was the first person in a long time who she's been able to touch without feeling like a freak, but she thinks he betrayed her.  She doesn't want him to teach her how to use her abilities to their fullest extent, so she goes to the planet Change, to accomplish the same thing in a much more dangerous way.<br />The alien races in this book were very interesting, although I had trouble picturing them in my mind.  One of the main failings of this book is that the author doesn't describe things well enough.  In spite of that, however, I really enjoyed this book.  I've read Timeshadow Rider and her Dancer books, and it's this book and all of those that led me to believe that I could enjoy futuristic romance.  However, I was disappointed, because there are very few books with that label that are like this.  The science fiction elements are actually important and work well with the romantic elements.	2002-06-13

Occasionally, I thought Jude needed to develop a spine a little more quickly, but otherwise I liked her.  Aidan was an enjoyable character who had some interesting tales to tell, although I didn't think it was entirely believable that he would think Jude needed all the practical details of what a marriage with him could bring her spelled out.  For a while there, it seemed as though his brain had left him, but, for the most part I really like him too.  The story that runs through the trilogy of Lady Gwen and Carrick is fascinating, and I think it's better integrated into the story than some of the other things Nora Roberts has done (I thought the Legend of Seraphina storyline running through her Dream trilogy was fairly worthless).  There were several really fun parts in the book; one that I really enjoyed was when Brenna and Darcy stayed at Jude's cottage for a while, tried on her clothes, and drank a lot.  It was hilarious, although at times Jude did come off as a bit pathetic.	2002-06-13

Of the three heroines in the trilogy, I think Brenna is my favorite.  When she sees what she wants, she goes off and gets it.  Shawn was weakest element of this book.  I thought he was fairly bland and not nearly as interesting as the men in the other two books.  Brenna has to poke and prod him most of the time in order to get him to move forward in life, or he'd just as happily cook in the pub's kitchen and write music.  As with the first book, there are several amusing bits in this book, although as a whole I think I like this book a little less than Jewels of the Sun.	2002-06-13

The group of teens in the Club are fun to read about, although, in some cases, a little black-and-white (Diana is very Good, Faye is very Bad).  There's the usual romance that you find in L. J. Smith's books - Cassie loves a guy she can't have because he's the boyfriend of someone she respects.  I enjoyed the forbidden romance parts of the book, as well as the parts where Cassie is trying to adjust in a school where no one seems to like her or want to help her.  I think The Secret Circle Trilogy is one of L. J. Smith's best trilogies, and I really enjoy the first book in it.	2002-06-08

The examples range from spelling mistakes, to mixed-up or misunderstood words, to creatively rewritten history.  I know the panic of having to write a timed essay on something I don't quite remember the details to, and I know I've written a few things that had some embarassing mistakes in them because I finished them without enough time to check for errors.  I'm sure that quite a few of the examples in this book were the result of a complete lack of knowledge (not to mention writing skills), but that doesn't mean all of them were.  In the Postscript, the professor who compiled these examples gives some of his own thoughts about how these errors might have occurred.  If you're a college student yourself, you might want to take a look at this book - it's worth quite a few good laughs and it might convince you to look over your tests and papers more before you turn them in.  I know I certainly don't want parts of my papers to end up in a book like this!	2002-06-08

Although I don't personally think this book has all that many glaring historical inaccuracies (not as many as, say, The Serpent's Shadow), I also don't know very much about the history of this time period.  As far as the rest goes (characters, plot, etc.), I thought this book was pretty good.  <br />I enjoyed reading about Rose and Jason, and the magical system that the author created for this book fascinated me.  The Fire Elementals we interesting creatures, and I wish something more had been done with the Sylphs.  Mostly, I think the author did a nice job with the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; idea, and I count this book as one of my more favorite retellings of that story.  <br />Something that did bother me about this book, although not enough to disturb my enjoyment of the book very much, was the ending.  Although this book is based on a fairy tale, that doesn't mean all the problems that developed during the book can be easily resolved with a happily everafter.  However, that is precisely what the author did.  Somehow, I don't think &quot;the natives...in the Far East&quot; would react as calmly to seeing a half man, half wolf person in their streets as Rose seems to think they will, and I don't think the possibility of Jason becoming a bloodthirsty monster was resolved very well.  <br />In spite of my problems with the ending, I really like this book.  It's definitely the best of the Elemental Magic books, and it's good enough that I've reread it a few times.	2002-06-08

All the hype made me wary, but I finally picked it up so I could see what all the fuss was about.  I'm 19 years old and absolutely love this book.  I won't say that the idea behind the book is a new one - I've read several books where the main character is a kid who's discovered that there's something special about him/her and is going to a school where that specialness can be nutured (Arrows of the Queen by Mercedes Lackey comes to mind; it's also an excellent book, and I recommend it if you like this one).  However, I like that kind of story, and J. K. Rowling's writing style is enjoyable to read.  It's easy to see that she's got the details of her world figured out; it's makes rereading fun, because you can catch all sorts of things that you might've missed that she brings up later in the book or even later in the series.	2002-06-05

Rejar was, at times, a very interesting character, although, interestingly enough, not as interesting as when he was only a minor character in Knight of a Trillion Stars.  Some parts of the book were very funny, and some parts were very sweet, and if there had been more of these scenes I would've been able to believe that Rejar and Lilac could be in love.  <br />I don't like regency romance because I don't like the society and its rules.  However, what bothered me most about this book was not that it had a regency setting and regency heroine, it was Rejar.  In Knight of a Trillion Stars, he seemed very charming, more so than Lorgin.  In this book, he was much more domineering.  He tricks Lilac into marrying him, even though she doesn't want to.  There's at least two sex scenes that really bothered me - they were almost rape.  In those scenes Rejar uses sex as a kind of punishment.  Although we are assured that she actually enjoyed it all and that he didn't hurt her, Lilac is a bit frightened during both of them and Rejar pretty much orders her to stay there and have sex with him.  That isn't the sort of thing I want or look for in a romance novel, and, although I did like Rejar, it was hard to like him after scenes like that.<br />Lilac herself is a fairly boring heroine.  She still behaves a lot like a child in some ways, throwing tantrums and pouting to get her way.  She might've managed to be a better heroine if this book hadn't been set in Regency England.  I cheered when she continued to refuse Rejar, even though she thought he looked gorgeous, because of his arrogant behavior, but he still bulldozed over her.  In spite of all she'd done to keep from marrying him, her aunt gave the marriage her blessing and Rejar carried her kicking and screaming down the aisle.  I would've preferred Rejar's mate to be a Familiar woman, someone who could probably hold her own against him and hopefully not incite near-rapescenes.	2002-06-05

Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt.  Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it.  Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back.  Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.<br />If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash.  Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book.  It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity).  This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond.  I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers.  Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot.  The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says.  This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette.	2002-06-02

In the war between Urtho, the Mage of Silence, and Ma'ar, Skan is sorely needed. The war is not going well for Urtho and his people, and everyone, from the soldiers and generals to those who heal mind, body, or heart, is working themselves to exhaustion. <br />This was actually the first Heralds of Valdemar book I read; I picked it up because of the gryphon on the cover, and I wasn't sorry about it in the least. Although it's not exactly a Heralds of Valdemar book, since it takes place about 1000 years before Valdemar even existed, there are things in this book that become important in later books in the series. Without the Mage Wars books, there would be no reason for the Mage Storms Trilogy, and we get to see what the Tayledras and Shin'a'in used to be. Skan, Amberdrake, Winterhart, and Zhaneel are all not just perfect little beings whose only failings are that they can't save everyone (although I suppose Amberdrake is the closest to being like that). Too often, Mercedes Lackey's newest books feature main characters that feel almost too perfect and give you a sense that you're being preached at. That's not the case with this book. <br />Just a note about the hardcover edition in comparison to the paperback edition: if you want the artwork inside the book to look its best, I'd advise you to get the hardcover. There's an illustration at the beginning of each chapter, and the illustrations in the paperback edition are a little too dark to see everything clearly. Although I didn't like the illustrations of the humans too much, the illustration of the nonhumans were a great help, since I'm not a big raptor person. Still, it's a nitpicky thing, but even this artwork, done by the author's husband, doesn't quite match the book's description. However, I do like the illustrations, especially the one of Zhaneel.	2002-05-30

Tristan is only half human, but he doesn't know that.  His mother comes from beyond the Wall, and Dunstan could've loved her and chose instead to live a more normal life in the town of Wall.  Tristan knows only that Victoria Forester is the most beautiful girl in the world.  Although it's fairly obvious Victoria isn't interested in him, he believes that he will win her hand in marriage if he brings her the star they saw fall.  In order to find it, he has to go beyond the Wall (something no one in his town has ever done).  During his journey he meets many strange and often frightening beings and discovers that the star isn't quite what he thought it was.<br />This story has a lovely fairy tale feel, which I mostly enjoyed.  However, because it was written so that it feels like a fairy tale, it has some of the same sort of drawbacks a fairy tale has.  None of the characters are ever really developed that well.  You get to know the characers just well enough that you can come to like them and maybe even care about what happens to them, but they don't feel as three-dimensional as I know Neil Gaiman could make them.  Although that occasionally irked me, I found myself getting caught up enough in the story that, for the most part, I didn't care.  Tristan was an idiot who managed to grow up as the story progressed, and I loved the star.  The romance was a bit weak, but it didn't show up out of the blue.  Although a lot of the story was predictable, Gaiman kept it interesting with a strange assortment of beings.  The way he tied everything together was wonderful (although it almost felt TOO clever and nearly...cute - especially his solution to \\"a week when two Mondays come together\\").	2002-05-29

The other half is human, and if any one in the Night World found out, they'd kill her.  Now living with her human mother's family, she kills those in the Night World who hunt humans.  Circle Daybreak, a group that wants harmony between the Night World and humans, gives Jez a mission.  They heard that Morgead, a member of the gang Jez used to be a part of, has a Wild Power, a person mentioned in prophecies about the end of the world.  If Jez can't get the Wild Power to someplace safe, the world will end at the turn of the new millenium.<br />The Night World series now has a particular direction it's going in, and it's a thrilling one to read about.  Just a warning, though: as far as I know, the series never gets finished, and we never get to see what happens at the turn of the new millenium.  In this book, we get to see someone walk two worlds in a different way than we're used to in this series.  Jez leads a double life with her new family and with Morgead, her soulmate.  I would've liked it if this book had been a little longer; everything seemed to happen so quickly, and it made me wish there were more for me to read.	2002-05-28

No one can help her - or so she thinks.  Her best friend, and the guy she's secretly in love with, is a vampire.  James is Poppy's soulmate and doesn't want her to die, but he's also a member of the Night World, a secret society of vampires, shape shifters, and witches.  That society has two cardinal rules: never let a human find out about the Night World and never fall in love with a human.  James has to break both those rules to help Poppy, and if anyone from the Night World finds out, including his own parents, it would mean death for both of them.<br />The cover is awful, I know, but don't let that stop you.  The Night World books are, in my opinion, L. J. Smith's best books, and this first one, while not the best in the series, is certainly very good.  I'm not sure how I feel about Poppy, since she seems to enjoy the hunt and blood (there's a few times when humans described as a sort of blood-filled fruit - oranges or berries), while at the same time having moments where she's either disgusted by the idea or at least wants to find a better way to do things (hunting animals instead, or something).  Mostly, however, she seems to enjoy what she is becoming.  Since James doesn't like being a vampire himself, it made me wonder how good a match those two really are anyway.  No of that interfered much with my enjoyment of the book, however, and I've liked it enough that I've reread it several times.	2002-05-28

Meredith Gentry works for a detective agency, but she's also a faerie princess.  Her life depends on no one finding that out, because her aunt, Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler on the Unseelie sidhe, would kill her if she could find her.  When Merry, is found, however, things don't happen quite as she thought they would.  She's got a chance at real political power, but first she has to survive court and everyone who wants her dead.  Also, she only gets that power if she can fufill the condition her aunt has set.  I'm not saying any more, but maybe that'll pique your interest.  :)<br />Now, I didn't really like this book the first time I read it, and probably would've given it 3 or even 2 stars.  I think it's because, after having read all the Anita Blake books up to the point when this book came out, I wasn't expecting what I got in this book.  I've read awful deaths before in the Anita books, but none of them this much, and this detailed, sex, near-sex, and sexual behavior.  In my first read, most of it seemed pretty gratuitous and pointless, but I've since decided that LKH build a pretty solid and alien world.  The fey in this book are definitely different from humans.  I loved the politics; Meredith is smart and, as long as she doesn't become super-powerful, I'll enjoy reading more about her.	2002-05-25

She escapes and ends up on a world where the only mages are male and no one seems to have the proper reverence for magic.  Young mages are dangerous (every student at the school is there because he killed someone when his powers came into being), and the school Lisane stays at also functions as a kind of prison.  Many students don't survive the methods used to teach them, but Lisane is determined to get through it all and find a place for herself on this backward planet.<br />Although this isn't a ha-ha sort of book, like, say, the Discworld series, the author has a sense of humor and it shows.  Lisane's observations about this new culture she's found herself in are highly amusing.  The author did a great job writing characters that, although not always likeable, were fascinating the read about.  The book drops in quality at the end, when the author condenses a planet-wide event/conflict into about 15 pages.  The author didn't spend nearly enough time fleshing out the character Kaihan, considering how much larger his role in the book gets near the end.  In spite of all that, I love this book and plan on reading it again any time I need a good snicker along with an interesting fantasy environment and plot.	2002-05-25

Loro, Ria, and Trentor just spent a lot of time running away from things and it started to get a little boring after a while.	2002-05-22

It was an interesting read, but fairly slow at parts.  The writing was sometimes repetative and redundant, but it wasn't really difficult to get through.  I can't really say the book was good or bad.  The biggest problem I had with it was the romance the author added to it.  It seemed very tacked on, as if Mercedes Lackey remembered at the last minute that she wanted to have some romance in it and wasn't too concerned about integrating it well.  We don't even see the man Marina falls in love with until at least half way through the book, and there is nothing in the way the two of them interact to indicate that there is anything developing between the two of them, except maybe friendship.  Still, almost near the end of the book, Marina suddenly realizes she's in love with him and doesn't want to be without him.  The tacked on romance and the occaisional problems with the writing make me wonder how much time the author actually spent revising this book, although the book didn't make me cringe as much as The Serpent's Shadow.	2002-05-22

Thea and Eric were almost too goody-goody as main characters for my taste, but they were still fun to read about.  I thought Blaise was one of the most interesting characters, with so many layers it's hard to really figure her out.  The author did a wonderful job creating characters you could care about.	2002-05-22

This book doesn't have the feel that a lot of supposedly futuristic romances have, that the only thing that makes them different from uncivilized barbarian hero stories is that they're set on a different planet.  The fantasy elements are actually important to the story, although the author doesn't do as much with them as she should.  The annoying part of this book is the way the main characters act.  Lorgin seems determined to make sure that nothing touches Deana's life unless he allows it (at one point he tells her she can't see one of her male friends again).  Deana does fight him over this occaisionally, but she always crumbles 'cause he's so big and handsome.  She needed to learn to take charge.  The most interesting character in this book is Rejar, who seems much more charming than Lorgin.	2002-05-20
US	42442234	R2VFRILWTPKOE8	0590471821	524509334	Dinotopia	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Beautiful book, interesting read	Although this book is considered a children's book, or something for young teens, I believe it's enjoyable for people of all ages.  The artwork is gorgeous and the detail Gurney puts into creating his world is amazing.  The book is written in the form of a journal, written mostly by Arthur Denison, but with a few entries written by his son, Will.  Because Arthur is a scientist, Gurney can believably put in a great deal of detailed information about the world of Dinotopia.  I loved reading this book and I especially loved looking at it.	2002-05-20

I've never read any Dinotopia books before, and I decided to read this after seeing Dinotopia on tv.  The illustrations in this book are gorgeous.  The author skipped over a lot of details, turning this into a really bare-bones story, but it was still a good read.	2002-05-20

I'm still not sure I like Bill, but this book has just that same sort of quirky/serious mix that the first book had.  I also liked the little relationship tangles in this book.  I can't wait to see what happens next.	2002-05-12
US	42442234	RKFZMOO9TF6O2	044100900X	301706376	Jenna Starborn	Books	2	3	3	N	N	aggravating	I haven't read Jane Eyre, so I can't review this book from that point of view, although a few of my friends told me that this book follows the plot pretty closely.  I can say that I found the two main characters, Jenna and Everett, to be fairly aggravating.  Jenna is smart as far as math and science go, but she's an idiot when it comes to people.  Even though she likes her job and Everett's ward, she makes hardly any argument when Everett talks about her giving all that up once they're married.  I don't understand it.  And I can't help but dislike Everett for the way he acts through a great deal of the book.  I think the author crippled herself trying to follow Jane Eyre, because I know she can do a better job than this.	2002-05-12

It happens to be my favorite out of all the ones Mercedes Lackey has written.  I love Talia, and seeing the Herald Collegium from her eyes is a lot of fun.  You don't get to see a lot of the Companions in this book, and Rolan can't talk to Talia, but I still like the bits where Rolan and Talia are together.  Also, this was written back when Mercedes Lackey still knew how to write a sensitive, caring character without making him/her seem preachy or overbearing about it.	2002-05-12

The author did a great job gradually making the main character, Corrie, grow up.  The gradual maturation was really believable, and I grew to really like Corrie and the rest (and really despise the prince).  The aliora were very interesting as well, and I would've liked to learn a little more about them, besides what they're like in captivity.	2002-05-12

Rand T'Ash was the worst, and I really wonder why Danith ever fell for him.  I've read several romance novels with arrogant male characters (for example, every Dara Joy book), and I liked a lot of those, but Rand didn't have any likeable characteristics that I could see, other than the fact that he was gorgeous.  That's not enough.  The only reason I don't give the book a one is because of Zanth, T'Ash's feline Familiar.  Owens does a brilliant job with him.  The best dialouges were the ones where someone was talking with Zanth.  This author should really stick to writing cats.	2002-05-12

The biggest problem I had with this book was, in fact, the complexity. It was often hard for me to keep up with the new rules/developments Maxwell laid down. I loved the characters, but the book was an exhausting read.	2001-08-28

It read like a regency romance with the male and female roles switched and then she added on a lot of terms and phrases to makes it futuristic.  I liked the main characters, but I had a hard time keeping their supposed social roles in mind (male is weak, female has control over him).  Add to that the fact that skipping to the glossary is occaisionally neccessary, and the book gets kind of awkward.  It wasn't a bad book, but I didn't like it as much as her Matrix of Destiny books.	2001-08-22
