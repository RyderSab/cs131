This book is different and special. <br /> <br />Ms. Kellerman went into her family history to create a novel set in  1920's Munich.  She uses the device of a serial killer to make this  familiar to her readers. <br /> <br />What was greatly impressive was her depiction of the people of that time....their fears, their allegiances...sometimes one of which might backfire. <br /> <br />Some chose family, some power. <br /> <br />This is a powerful book, well written, and worth reading. <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.	2005-10-13

Since it was my day off, I had the luxury of finishing this book after dinner. <br /> <br />So...it is a great \\"page turner\\".  But more that that, it makes you think very hard about what religion is all about. <br /> <br />The story is that of an archaeologist who discovers some ancient scrolls giving new light on the origins of Christianity.  The scrolls tells of an \\"early Christian era\\" woman's search for the Redeemer, the importance of women in early Christianity, and what she learned on her journey.   <br /> <br />The tale of the archaeologist, and her friends, and their efforts to bring the scrolls to light is riveting, fast-paced, and compelling. <br /> <br />I hope that I do not demean either author, but, I could not help noticing the similarity with the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.  Both authors have recognized the importance of women in church history.  They also both recognize the importance of Mary Magdalene. <br /> <br />Last comment....this is a book that gives me faith...I think that that is a good thing.	2005-10-10

I thought I would give it 30 pages, and, if it interested me, I would keep reading.  Well, I kept reading. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the mystery, but more that that, I was entranced by the people who made up this book.  I felt drawn into Berkeley sub-culture, and into the lives of many wonderful people, some of whom had questionable pasts.   <br /> <br />The greatest part of this mystery is not the story, but the people.  The author has presented a real, living place with real, albeit kooky people.   <br /> <br />I hope he goes back there, so that I can read a sequel. <br /> <br />Oh, and I already have recommended this book to a friend.	2005-10-10

A few weeks later, the husband was sent, with the army, from China to Tibet.  This is the story of the wife's quest to find her husband, or her husband's fate in Tibet after having been informed of his death.  She also travelled as a \\"physician/soldier\\" but stayed many years, learning of Tibet in her search for her husband. <br /> <br />I was profoundly impressed by the essential goodness of each of the characters in the book.  It reminds me, at a time when many people are at war, that people are, or can be, essentially good. <br /> <br />Thank you, Xinran, for sharing Shu Wen's story with us.  And, Shu Wen, if you hear of this book, thank you for sharing your story with Xinran.	2005-09-23

The family has not given up, and about fifteen years later, the search resumes in full force (not by the police, but because the mother will not let go).  It is the story of three sisters, their mother, father, and other people in their lives.  They deal with, or not, the child gone missing. <br /> <br />The effects of the loss of this child, for her sisters, and her parents, is well written.  Also, the search for her when Ellie's sister is an adult. <br /> <br />Also, there is a resolution, extraordinarily well written, as is this book. <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone, except perhaps a new parent (just because of the subject).  It is well written, a good story, and, I plan to read more by this author. <br /> <br />P.S.  My synopsis is lousy...I would suggest that you read the book and don't listen to me.	2005-09-20

And, indeed, sometimes their friendship was what would help one survive.  They lived in a time of tradition... foot-binding, filial duty, and hardship for a daughter. <br /> <br />Somehow, the author has managed to convey the pain, and also the occasional joy, that a female would experience in that era.  There was the joy of unbound feet of childhood, and the pain when her feet were bound. There was the joy of friendship, but also the pain when friends were separated, and had to learn their \\"filial\\" duties.    <br /> <br />This book is an homage to the daughter who had her feet bound,  married into a family she did not know, and survived, doing her best to honor her marriage family with children, especially boys.  And, if she gave birth to girls, to bind her daughters' feet properly, and raise her daughters to....continue the cycle. <br /> <br />It is also an homage to the secret ways of the women of the time, their sisterhood. <br /> <br />Finally, it is also a well-written book, a book that spoke of all of that above, but did so in the form of a great story.   <br /> <br />I like to learn things from an author who writes well.  That is what happened here.  I learned, but that happened because I was compelled to read the story.  Thank you, Lisa See! <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

I read it as a story, but then found myself thinking about who the \\"we\\" is.  It is a worthy read, just as a story; the author is also talented in the use of words.     But, what impressed me most about the novella is that it is making me think about who the \\"we\\" is in \\"we\\".  (That sentence will make sense after you have read it).    Are we a union, a family, friends, neighbors, a family faction, or, extrapolating, a nation, a planet?  Who makes up the \\"we\\" and where does our responsibility lie.  Things are happening all over the world, where do we fit in, and what is our responsibility, if any, to someone else.  As I said, this book made me think.    About the short stories, while I read and enjoyed them, they did not make an impression on me, short stories are not my favorite genre.    But the novella, I plan to read it again in a few months.  Something that makes me think is worth reading again.    p.s.  Other things make me think, I don't want you to think that I will not think until I read this again...  ;)	2005-09-16

Some are just for fun, some are silly, some are educational, some are not very good.  But, every now and then, I find one that is so special that I will read it again, and probably again a few more times. <br /> <br />You can read a \\"summary\\" of the book in other reviews, both publishers' and readers'.  So, why did I like it and why should you read it. <br /> <br />First, the story is incredible.  A child born in poverty begins to show amazing intelligence, skills...and grows to womanhood having had profound effect on her country of birth.  Truth is indeed \\"stranger than fiction\\". <br /> <br />Second, the author has an amazing talent with words.  He gives you the sights, sounds, smells of the world in which Teresita lived.  He also uses words to bring each person to life.  I actually called a friend to share a quote...Tomas Urrea to Lauro Aguirre....\\"Although it is true that you are insufferable and irritating, and rightly famed for your endless posturing and platudinous pontificating...\\"  (don't worry, potential reader, though, the book is not full of big words, just, occasionally, one creeps in...I loved that quote because it reminded me of someone.) <br /> <br />Third, I was able to experience a time and place distant from me.    Some of what happened was horrific, but, it happened.  I was able to begin to understand. <br /> <br />Finally, I loved this book, and will read it again because it contains a message of love and hope that I can understand. <br /> <br />Books do many things, entertain, enlighten and sometimes enrich. <br /> <br />This book enriches, enlightens and entertains.	2005-09-11

I live in Los Angeles, and all I knew were news reports.      The concept of chapters as \\"minutes\\" was interesting.      Before I continue, I must tell you that I did not read all the chapters, I sometimes skimmed here and there.  To be quite honest, the book did not work for me.  There were a few chapters that touched me, but most of the book felt cold.      Perhaps I would read it differently a few years from now.    My final comment, the author is French, he has a different perspective.  Do not discount this book just because I am American.  Perhaps it is too soon for me to read it. Or, perhaps,  he does not understand, himself, enough to write about this.  I do not know....time will tell.    Charlie_in_LA	2005-08-31

My complaint, however, is that the book notes....you know, the stuff on the inside flaps...told me more than I wanted to know before I read the book.  However, since I don't think that that was the author's fault, the book still gets a five. <br /> <br />As I said, a wonderful twisty. <br />I enjoyed the protagonist. I have not read this author before, but his character is a discerning man.  I liked that he knew himself quite well.  The mystery itself...well, there is gory stuff, understated. If you cannot abide blood, skip this book, but, the brutality of the murders is a part of the story.  I fear to say too much.  Not, that I am afraid of retribution, but, that I am afraid of saying too much to the next reader.   <br /> <br />So, again, this book is a wonderful twisty whodunnit....set in China....a great read. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-29

While I do not have children, I can empathise with each burp and well, whatever, her children do.  This book is a welcome addition to the series.  While I am saddened by what I learn about the system as it deals with children born in prison, I am heartened by the compassion shown here.  Ms. Waldman has written a first-rate mystery with wonderful light notes here and there.  She also gives us a look at the sadder side of the care of the children born into the penal system. <br /> <br />Oh, and for those readers who participate in a book discussion group....chapter three is a \\"must read\\"!!!!!	2005-08-24

I learned a lot about Italy during WWII...partisans and citizens, especially. <br /> <br />For a synopsis, read the publisher's reviews.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, you do, however, as a reader, sometimes need a character list.  Fortunately, it is provided before the first pages of the novel.  <br /> <br />As I got used to bouncing between characters, I began to see the thread that bound them all together.  By the time I finished this novel, all were woven together.   <br /> <br />And, when the book is finished, you will have need of the tears you saved.	2005-08-22

His book of short stories, \\"Twisted\\", was wonderful, in fact, I recommended it to my non-mystery reading friends. I have done so as well with this book.  What appears to be a \\"straightforward attempted crime\\" becomes something else, then something more. Twists and turns, and yet they all make sense.  Oh, and people you care about...and people you hate but want to understand....    Geneva, the young protagonist is wonderful, o.k., when we meet her she has smarts beyond what would we would expect, but we later learn why.    Rhyme and Sachs, well, they are as great as we would expect them to be.      You can read about the story in the bookjacket.    You can not understand how wonderful and multi-layered it is until you read the book.    I would highly recommend this book to anyone.	2005-08-10

It was interesting, and the story threads of the two cases kept me reading.  These days, I sometimes do stop reading a book because I was not interested; that was not the case in this one.  I wanted to read it through to the end to see where the characters were going, and how the cases would be resolved. <br /> <br />I did think, however, that in the first 90% of the book, the author was setting a scene for his concluding chapters, and that the concluding chapters came too quickly.  The story became relatively complete, but in its conclusion it felt like too much too fast...based on the previous chapters. <br /> <br />I did like the book (Thank you Amazon, I think that comment is permissable in your reviews) and intend to read his next.	2005-08-09

So, my reaction as a reader. <br /> <br />I was caught up in the first few pages.  The characters were people  to me almost immediately, and remained so throughout the book.  The  mother-daughter tension was real (I don't have a daughter, but I am one.) <br /> <br />I sometimes had a bit of trouble with the clues, the actions of the characters, especially in the middle of the book. <br /> <br />But, when it came down to the last pages, I wanted to read every word, hoping that I could solve...I wished I was there to help. <br />So...I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre...and I personally will look forward to the author's next book.  Until that comes out, this is an excellent read.	2005-07-07

This is a gentle book, a good one, and one that I will remember.  There is a special quality in a book when you feel you know the people there...you want to meet them and speak with them.

One thing I must commend the author on...I appreciate his use of different type faces for each of the voices in this novel. <br /> <br />So...This book is both a mystery, and a mystery solved.

It presents thought-provoking ideas about the Intifada, Israeli and Palestinian culture, and the Middle East as a whole.  Other books by this author have been more involved in Hassidic (sorry if I spelled that wrong) culture. <br /> <br />Read other reviews to find out about the story (or read the book). <br /> <br />What I found most interesting is how the author pointed out how \\"history repeats itself\\".  This was never stated, but that is what I found most fascinating.   <br /> <br />Other than that, I pictured her characters, \\"warts and all\\"...I knew them through her writing.

US	16750051	RCEABVCGQECPZ	0805075984	72415126	Outside Valentine: A Novel	Books	5	7	7	N	N	a novel worth reading	I am fascinated by the author's technique of using three voices to tell this story, and how they all come together by the end of the book.  Each voice evokes the flavor of his or her era.  A very talented author has shared a book with us. I hope she will share more. <br /> <br />I do have one bit of advice to you, if you should read this wonderful book.....In the first few chapters, take note of the years....this is a story told by three people, in different times.  Get to know them. <br /> <br /> <br />Thanks, Liza Ward, for your book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-25

In No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, I felt as though I could stop by for a cup of bush tea.  The information was there in this mystery, I guess, but it did not create a picture for me.  In fact, I had to look back at the book to remember her name. <br />Unfortunately, this new series, at least so far, does not give you the feeling of \\"knowing\\" your detective.  And that is what makes me come back. <br />Having said that, I will try the next installment, I just hope the author can, through his words, show me enough about Ms. Dalhousie so that I would begin to understand her.  I would like her to become a person to me.	2004-12-03

Ms. Clarke has created a new world for us to enjoy if we only take the time. <br /> <br />But, don't read this expecting Harry Potter, it is not, but it is just as good.  Don't expect Jane Austen, yes, it has the flavor of the period, but, again, it is not, but it is just as good. <br /> <br />To properly savor this book, allow the time.  I once rushed through a book of this size in two nights, but this one needs more care.  I took eight days to read Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell and that, even, was too fast. <br /> <br />So....read slowly, and savor the words of this world.  Take your time with the footnotes; while they are not required, they make the book ever so much better.  And, if you find from time to time, as did I, that the book suddenly seems a bit tedious, make a cup of tea.  Then, come back and read ten more pages, and you will once again be entranced. <br /> <br />I work in a library, and I would recommend this book to almost every reader I know. <br /> <br />I recommend this to any reader who will take the time to enjoy this world.  This is an entrancing book.  I hope you will read and enjoy it.	2004-11-27

Also, Osama BinLadin.  Her story of a woman raised partly, or mostly in a Western culture, then moving to an Islamic culture is mesmerizing.  From her, I learned much about the BinLaden family and also Saudi ways.  This book is well worth reading, although it is too short.  I wish she had shared more with us.  What this book provided to me was more information on how the BinLaden family was also a financial empire and how it worked.  That is something I had not really understood.  I am learning now.	2004-10-22
