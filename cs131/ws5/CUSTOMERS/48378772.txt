He was a military genius, plantation owner, Indian fighter, a racist toward non-whites, controversial loser of the 1824 and easy winner of the 1828 & 1832 Presidential elections, orphan, scarred by the British and married to a married woman, his true love. Mr. Brands tells his story of a man of contradictions in 600+ pages.    Mr. Brands writes a dense, just the facts approach in his biography of this populist President from the West who campaigned against the elitist Northeast. The true climax of his Presidency was his delaying the onset of the Civil War with his staring down his own Vice-President and the South with a genuine military show of force during the secession crisis.    Mr. Brands has written the best one volume biography of the seventh President, surpasssing Robert Remini's own 400+ page condensation (\\"The Life of Andrew Jackson\\"--1988) of his classic trilogy on Andrew Jackson. However, given that Jackson was at the center of American history for over 60 years, the reader is referred to Mr. Remini's three volume definitive biography of 1,600 pages (1977, 1981, 1984) for a fuller, richer picture of this fascinating President. In deciding which to read, it depends on how much time and how much interest the reader has in Andrew Jackson.	2005-10-09

This is not the definitive account of the 1906 quake but the account of what Mr. Winchester found to be interesting -- fortunately it is interesting for the reader too.    The book is a wonderful geology book for the non-science reader as Mr. Winchester lays out why the quake occurred where it occurred (see the maps within) with vignettes with the fallout from the quake. He also makes clear that the next San Francisco earthquake is just down the road and we are no more prepared for that one either. The book cover itself is innovative and almost worth the price of the book. For the reader desiring a more traditional history of the 1906 quake, see Dan Kurzman's \\"Disaster: The Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906\\" (2001).	2005-10-09

Her newest creation is a portrait of one family, especially one daughter, who are rocked by a crime that creates the title of the novel. The reader should be aware that this title has two meanings which are the twin themes of the novel.    Ms. Oates goes back to re-visit Mount Ephrain in upstate New York (also the hometown of \\"We were the Mulvaneys\\"-1996). The secrets uncovered by the daughters, how they made their life choices, and how they cope with their \\"Missing Mom\\" is the heart of the book. While this is a short work (at 400+ pages) for Ms. Oates, the story benefits from the lack of overwriting that occasionally detracts from her longer works. This a book to savor over a rainy weekend.	2005-10-07

Everything that could go wrong did go wrong : from the right two ships colliding (one of them carrying nearly 3,000 tons of munitions) to the bomb ship drifting to Halifax before exploding and the blizzard that struck the City afterwards. <br /> <br />The disorganized search and rescue attempts through the snowstorm of the City in rubble (think of the destruction caused by hurricanes or by an atomic bomb) takes up the last half of the book. Nearly 2,000 people were killed by the blast with disabling injuries for the thousands of survivors. Ms. MacDonald writes of her native City with more detail than was perhaps necessary but the story is a page-turner and serves as a warning to the reader that life has not changed much in terms of disaster relief over the past century.	2005-10-02

His tale of the bouts between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling in the 1930's offers another snapshot of racism and culture in American and Germany.  <br /> <br />Max Schmeling was the Aryan champion for Hilter who had been humilated in his master race rantings by the four gold medals of Jesse Owens in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Though never a Nazi, Mr. Schmeling was part of the German propaganda machine with his 12th round knockout of Mr. Louis in 1936. Since their rematch was so anti-climatic in 1938 (Mr. Louis utterly dominated Mr. Schmeling in a first round TKO), Mr Margolick focuses on the politics of boxing, of America, and of Nazi Germany by contrasting their two very different careers and post-boxing lives. This will be considered the definitive story of their bouts and an excellent introduction to their lives.	2005-09-30

The book is short because his life was short -- he didn't even live to see his 30th year. What makes this biography different is how Mr Hemphill weaves vignettes from the impact that Hank Williams had upon his life. <br /> <br />\\"Lovesick Blues\\" takes it title from the No. 1 hit that launched Mr. Williams into superstardom for the last five years of his life. Mr. Williams became the face of country music and paved the way for another Southern boy (Elvis Presley) to became the future face of rock and roll. <br /> <br />Born into a vagabond, poor family that drifted from town to town, he was an alcoholic before he was an adult and had addiction & health issues for the rest of his life. Mr Hemphill debunks the worse of the mythic stories of his self-destructive choices, maintaining the truth of his illnesses, martial woes and addictions were bad enough. He lived to perform, sang about the hard life he knew personally, and died young -- all used up like his successor would be, Elvis Presley. For the reader interested in the similarities between the two singers, I recommend Peter Guralnick's definitive two volume account of Elvis Presley: \\"LastTrain To Memphis\\" (1995) and \\"Careless Love\\" (2000).	2005-09-25

The translation reads so smoothly that the reader would not be aware that the book originated in Italy. A quick read at less than 200 pages, \\"The Days Of Abandonment\\" is for anyone who suffers an unexpected rejection from a long-time lover or spouse. <br /> <br />The novel is accurate in tracing the major depression that Olga undergoes and comes through with agonizing pain and not always with grace. But she does come through it. The universality of abandonment is the same whether the reader is in Italy or America or anywhere else.	2005-09-25

This is not a conventional novel but a creative one if the reader gives it a chance. The central event of the novel is the influenza pan-epidemic during World War I as seen through the eyes of a married couple in Boston and of the souls who have perished of the flu in 1918.     Ms. Goldberg stretches out her book to the 1990's by the device of following the strange corporate history of the husband's invention, Wickett's Remedy. While the story covers a lot of ground (there is a sub-plot involving unethical medical testing by the US Government), the characters, even as they die off, are compelling. In a book about death, this wonderful novel reaffirms life in its own fashion. For further historical background, the reader is referred to John Barry's \\"The Great Influenza\\" which tells how 20 million persons worldwide perished from this deadly virus.	2005-09-24

All of his works are in print after a century and countless books have analyzed and documented his life. Two of the best works are Twain's own \\"The Autobiography of Mark Twain\\" (400+ pages), edited by Twain scholar Charles Neider, and the Pulizer Prize biography by Justin Kaplan, \\"Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain\\" (500+ pages).    Ron Powers has contributed another biography with his \\"Mark Twain: A Life\\" (700+ pages). He has taken a \\"just the facts\\" approach to the details of Twain's life and avoided Mr. Kaplan's interpretive/psychoanalysis of Twain's Missouri youth, later depression and family tragedies.     What book should the reader chose? Well, Mr. Kaplan's book is still the Gold Standard, if for no other reason than its brilliant writing. Mr. Powers has researched a more detailed and traditional biography of Twain. But, for sheer fun, Mark Twain's own words (accurate or not) are among the funniest and most satirical he has ever written, while the closing chapter on the death of his daughter, Jean, are the most haunting and heart-rending you will ever read.	2005-09-22

A brilliant scholar and writer, he was a problem drinker at best and a disaster in his relationships with women (see his four marriages and many love affairs). It is fair to sum up his life as a personal battlezone and a professional genius.    Mr Dabney was a friend and editor of Edmund Wilson's later literary accomplishments. He utilizes his personal knowledge, Mr. Wilson's extensive diaries/essays/books/reviews and other's written perceptions of him to create an exhaustive and definitive account of his life.    Mr. Wilson seems to have been as careless in his personal affairs (money management was unknown to him) as he was careful with his writing. An early advocate of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Joyce, he became a political leftist during the Depression and an isolationist due to his experiences during World War I. The reader is referred to Mr. Wilson's classic account of the cost of war, \\"Patriotic Gore.\\" The reader will not be bored by this well-written and colorful life of Edmund Wilson.	2005-09-03

He singlehandedly created the car industry, it numerous suppliers and spin-off beneficiaries (new roads, diners, motels, et al). He paid his workers a credible salary so that they could afford his car but crushed labor unions who challenged his total control. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this was his zenith of creativity. As he aged, he refused to change with the passage of time and stayed stuck with his outdated concepts. He remained a control freak for the rest of his life which stunted the growth of his children and of the Ford Motor Company. His anti-Semitism colored his isolationist views and led to his endorsement of the \\"America First\\" movement for neutrality during World War II. <br /> <br />Mr Watts tells his sad tale with the right mixture of admiration for his professional contributions and disdain for his personal failings. He places Henry Ford within the culture of his times and how he altered Americvan society. For the reader desiring further information, Robert Lacy's \\"Ford: The Men and The Machine\\" (1986) portrays the story of the Ford family until the mid-1980's. <br />	2005-09-02

Weighing in at nearly 5 pounds, this novel is more reminiscent of the old social conscience potboilers of the 1800's by Victor Hugo (like \\"Les Miserables\\") and Leo Tolstoy (like \\"War and Peace\\") who would add informative lengthy observations on topics which did not advance the plot.    \\"Hunger's Bride\\" is a debut novel for Mr. Anderson who shows off his considerable writing skills with various points of view and literary devices. The cultural times and history of the female characters are drawn extensively. Though the book could have been edited downward to 1,000 pages easily, his publishers evidently are making a virtue of its length for marketing purposes.    Still, the revolving stories between the cultural oppression facing Sor Juana de la Cruz in her frontier society and that facing Beulah Limosneros in our society keeps the story moving. The reader should be aware that this is not a beach book but a tale that demands the full attention of the reader. Having said that, this novel is one to be savored over several weeks -- think of it as a literary mini-series.	2005-08-24

This the 9th installment of the massive alternative history epic by Harry Turtledove. The series spans from 1862 in \\"How Few Remain\\" to the early 1940's in the current volume. <br /> <br />Mr. Turtledove assumes that Lee wins a decisive victory in 1862 and America splits into two separate nations. The Confederates win the rematch war in the 1880's (with the help of England and France) while the USA defeats the South in World War I (with the aid of the German Empire). Now the series takes a turn and Mr. Turtledove clearly has the racist South standing in for Nazi Germany in his current trilogy. <br /> <br />This new volume opens in the midst of World War II, start by the CSA launching a surprise invasion of the North in the previous volume (\\"Return Engagement\\"). The enjoyment of these books is to see how Mr. Turtledove's imagination works on the changes if America was two nations: as a Southerner, General Patton splits the USA in half with his drive to Lake Erie, Al Smith and Charles LaFollette are the Socialist President/Vice-President of the USA, concentration camps are hidden deep in Texas and so forth.  <br /> <br />Mr. Turtledove is not a wordsmith but he is a good storyteller and the map showing the American continent divided into two countries will set the reader thinking. Because this novel opens without any of the vast history of the previous 80 years and only alludes to it, I recommend that the reader start at the begining with \\"How Few Remain\\" before reading this book. One can read this novel on its own merits, but the reader would miss the layers of richness that has gone before it.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-18

This is a reprint of a classic memoir of a woman's survival in the wreckage of a fallen Berlin from fifty years ago. <br /> <br />The anonymous writer writes grippingly of the brutal Russian occupation of Berlin in the late spring of 1945. Her first person account of the repeated rapes by the Russians and the choices that a woman needed to make in the chaos of war in order to live is chilling. The building ruins, the hunger, the lack of sanitation of a ruined capital are all here. \\"A Woman in Berlin\\" is a powerful book and will make the reader wonder how far they would go to survive if they were in a similiar situation. <br /> <br />	2005-08-15

Like many explorers of that century, Mr. Stanley was full of courage and perseverance but was short on empathy and common sense. The mission was all that mattered, regardless of the human cost and that was expensive for the local natives and to his rescue party. <br /> <br />There are excellent maps found prior to the narrative which helps orient the reader as to the progress of the expedition.  The authors tie up all the loose ends in an epilogue and hint strongly that the rescue mission was not worth the price paid in the human lives lost. \\"The Last Expedition\\" is a fast-paced, readable, and definative account of this epic three year journey through the unexplored Congo.	2005-07-29

Given her own painful past history of incest and eating disorders, Ms Harrison writes poignantly of the suffering and healing within the family. <br /> <br />\\"Envy\\" is the tale of a therapist, Will Moreland, and his wife reeling from the death of their son. The sexual complexities between this couple is touching -- for how can one physically love again after the death of a child? Similiar in theme with Judith Guest's \\"Ordinary People\\", Ms. Harrsion expands her plots to explore the losses  within Will's life with an estranged twin brother, an eccentric father and possibly a long-lost daughter. Will is a \\"wounded healer\\" initially unable to heal himself. <br /> <br />With its dark themes of pain, sexuality and death, this novel is not for everyone. The therapy sessions have the touch of truth to them (though they are too brief).

Newt Gingrich and his co-authors maintain that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg (plus subsequent wins at the fictional Battles of Union Mills and Gunpower River) did not automatically guarantee an end to the Civil War on Southern terms. This is a different approach than the one taken by Ward Moore in \\"Bring The Jubilee\\" or Harry Turtledove in his continuing series that began with \\"How Few Remain.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Never Call Retreat\\" is the most compelling and intense of the trilogy. The climatic Battle of Monocacy Creek vaguely resembles the actual Battle of Gettysburg with its accidental beginings and its winner-take-all monumental charge at its end. The reader with a background in the Civil War will identified the unlabeled photographs of various historical personages (although the photos of the carnage of war require no labels). The various hand-drawn maps would have been better served by a more professional rendition.  <br /> <br />My one quibble with the novel is with the fictional General Grant sacking inept commanders in 1863 while the historical Grant was far more tolerant when he came East in 1864 (see Cold Harbor, the Wilderness, et al). Otherwise this book rings true for what could have been. This is an outstanding series that should be read in the order that they were written, for the reader to benefit from the culminative power of the trilogy.	2005-07-06

Most Americans are unaware of the little-known political brawl over the ratification process that nearly failed to pass the Constitution -- i.e. New York approved it by a nail-biting vote of 30-27 while Virginia had a narrow 89-79 margin. Alexander Hamilton of New York and James Madison of Virginia were the winning \\"floor managers\\" for the Federalists of their respective states.    \\"Young Patriots\\" is a readable, lively account of the birth of American politics.

After working with Rudyard Kipling's \\"Kim\\" in the last book (\\"The Game\\"), the married detective couple sail from India for their first trip to America and a trip to Mary's past.  <br /> <br />The wonderful conceit of these books is that the retired and aging Mr. Holmes has found his soulmate in a much younger American woman. Ms. King usually works either literary characters or their authors into her plot and \\"Locked Rooms\\" is no different. The father of the American crime novel, Dashiel Hammett, makes a major appearance as a Pinkerton operative in his pre-novelist days (see his \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"The Thin Man\\" as representative of his writing at its best). The city of San Francisco in the 1920's becomes a character as Ms. King effectively invokes the mood of a people as they rebuild from the ashes of the 1906 earthquake. <br /> <br />This is longest book of the series since \\"The Beekeeper's Apprentice\\" (1994) kicked it off and the most ambitious. As a murder mystery/psychological thriller, it introduces for the first time the voice of Mr. Holmes (prior books were told solely from Mary Russell's perspective). \\"Locked Rooms\\" stands on its own merits but the tale becomes richer if the reader has read the other novels to pick up on various references to their past. <br /> <br />For other homages to the literary creation of Arthur Conan Doyle, the reader is referred to \\"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes\\", edited with notes by Leslie Klinger (2004), to \\"A Slight Trick Of The Mind\\" by Mitch Cullen (2005), and \\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\" by Nicholas Meyer (1974). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-24

Her childhood was shaped by attending a Bureau of Indian Affairs school in North Dakota where her parents taught (mother was of French-Ojibwe descent and father was of German stock). Her early novels (\\"Love Medicine\\" --1984 and \\"Tracks\\" --1988) told stories of the Chippewa tribe in North Dakota before she wrote of her Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota in fiction (\\"The Antelope Wife\\" --1998) and in a travel memoir (\\"Books And Islands in Ojibwe Country -- 2003). <br /> <br />Now she is writing a multi-volume children's epic of the history of her people as seen by through the eyes of Omakayas, a pre-teen Ojibwe girl growing up in the pre-Civil War Minnesota. The first book of the series, \\"The Birchbark House\\" (1999) explored the pre-Eden world (i.e. before the arrival of the white settlers) that was still dangerous, especially with the introduction of smallpox. Now the second novel, \\"The Game of Silence\\" continues that history with the coming encroachment of the American government. <br /> <br />Not least among its charms is the expose to the Ojibwe ways/culture/mindset of a day long ago. The pencil drawings by the author give a visual image to a world that will not be familiar to most. The writing is simple but clear, driven by the story of an approaching doom that has yet to arrive. Teenagers and adults will enjoy this story and look forward to future installments of the adventures of Omakayas and her people.	2005-06-19

(As an aside, I paid double for my copy a year ago.) Image the Library of America giving its lavish production style to the complete works of Gary Larson and you have an idea of the quality of the binding/printing/paper quality of this set. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be aware that each book is oversize and heavy (about ten lbs per volume: 1980-1986 and 1987-1994). Nor is it a book that one would read straight thru (not with 4,000+ cartoons), but rather to read one year's worth of drawings, laugh aloud, put down and pick again later for another browsing. There are brief essays that go with the color and B/W cartoons (up to 6 to a page). <br /> <br />The only humor set that I would compare this edition to would be the eventual 25 volume set of \\"The Complete Peanuts\\" by Charles Schulz (only three books have been published so far: 1950-1952, 1953-1954, and 1955-1956). While Peanuts can appeal to any age group, The Far Side needs an older teen or older to appreciate its absurd, but with a straight face style of humor.

Back when the NBA was a very distant third to baseball and football on the national scene, he has extensively researched the \\"away\\" game between the Knicks and the Warriors in Hersey, Pa. There was no televison coverage and the only preservation of the 100 point performance of Wilt was a ham radio operator who started his recording late in the game.<br /><br />\\"Wilt,1962\\" is an examination of race in the days of unoffical quotas, of sportsmanship where the Knicks felt that the Warriors were running up the score, and of team versus individual stardom. By the fourth quarter, the two teams were engaged in intense physical combat and intentionally fouling each other: the Knicks in an attempt to kept Wilt from scoring (he was a horrible foul shooter who had the night of his life by going 28 for 32 from the line) and by the Warriors who were trying to help Wilt when the Knicks started to play \\"stall ball.\\" Wilt made his 100th point in the final minute of play as the Warriors won, 169-147.<br /><br />This is not a full biography of Wilt but a story of an era captured within a single game. \\"Wilt, 1962\\" is similiar in tone to Frank Fitzpatrick's study of the 1966 NCAA title game between the all-black starting five from Texas Western and the all-white squad from Kentucky in \\"And The Walls Came Tumbling Down\\" (2000). It is readable as a history lesson disguised as a sports story.	2005-06-12

Starting with their respective autobiographies -- \\"My Life\\" (2004) and \\"Living History\\" (2003) -- and adding \\"The Clinton Wars\\" by Sidney Blumenthal (2003), \\"The Hunting Of The President\\" by Conason & Lyons (2000) and \\"Clinton: The President They Deserve\\" (1996) among others, the reader is faced with books that tend to be either praising or condemning the Clintons.    John Harris has written one of the few even-handed approaches toward Bill Clinton. Covering the politics of the 1990's for the Washington Post, he portrays Bill Clinton as a brilliant, undisciplined President who could could have been so much more. He describes his successes (Kosovo and welfare reform) and his failures (health care reform and the impeachment process). His greatest success may have have been outlasting his numerous enemies (hence the title of this book).    Mr. Harris has uncovered little original research about Clinton's Presidency but he synthesises all that has been published into a readable, coherent and balanced look at the man and his personal/political choices while in office. Mr. Clinton comes off as a tragic figure whose ambitious policy agenda came unravelled through his own hubris and the determined oppositon of Congressional Republicans. If there is one book that the reader wants to consult about the domestic and foreign policies of the prior decade, this is that book.	2005-06-09

What many readers may not realize is that he is a researcher par excellence as evidence by the ten years he spent reading original documents, interviewing and travelling to relevant sites for \\"Truman.\\" Now he utilizes some of his previous background research for \\"John Adams\\" to tell the tale of the crucial year of the American Revolution. \\"1776.\\"    Most Americans are familiar with the Christmas Eve crossing of the Delaware River to win the Battle of Trenton and to close out 1776. Mr. McCullough describes the more unfamiliar stories of the American siege of Boston in driving out the British army and the British victory in driving the Revoluntionary army from New York City.     His real strength is as an editor, in choosing which historical stories to include and to exclude, for his 284 page narrative (with 100 additional pages of supporting documentation) could easily have been thrice its current length. In fact, David Hackett Fischer's \\"Washington Crossing\\" (2004) and William Dwyer's \\"The Day Is Ours\\" (1983) are both over 400+ pages in reciting only the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.  The reader should be aware that \\"1776\\" is merely an introduction to that year, for the actions of the other Founding Fathers (and Mothers) are barely mentioned.     \\"1776\\" is fun to read as the 229th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence approaches. Mr. McCullough makes clear how close the American Revolution came to failing that year. British overconfidence and Washington's determination (for his battlefield experince as a military commander was nil) were the difference. The reader is directed to \\"Patriots\\" (1988) by A.J. Langguth for the best overall view of the American Revolution (1761-1783).	2005-05-24

The first half of the book is a basic primer on the background and events leading up to the Civil War. The more interesting section that follows is too short -- the alternative history of two nations (USA and CSA) co-existing in America up until 1918. For example, Mr. Ransom hypothesises that Woodrow Wilson of the CSA would have opposed Theodore Roosevelt of the USA during WW I.    This \\"what if\\" concept was done first and better by Harry Turtledove in his 8 volume series that currently stretches from 1862-1942 (begining with \\"How Few Remain\\"). Many of his historical assumptions seemed to be borrowed from the previous creations of Mr. Turtledove. The reader is also referred to \\"Dixie Victorious\\" edited by Peter Tsouras with ten essays by different authors on possible turning points for a Southern victory in the Civil War.	2005-05-14

His previous books were born out of his experiences as a Vietnam War veteran (see \\"A Rumor Of War\\" - 1977 and \\"Indian Country\\" - 1987). This time he writes about a war different from his own with masterful results. <br /> <br />He places his American characters in the ugly civil war that turn into genocide in the Sudan. As in Vietnam, his Americans believe that they have the answers and know what is best for the local Sudanese. They don't, and from that premise their growing involvement will bring tragedy by the close of the novel. <br /> <br />His storytelling of American do-gooders in way over their heads approaches epic proportions. It has riveting characters whom the reader will care about their respective fates. This is a long tale at nearly 700 pages -- it is double the length of his other books. \\"Acts of Faith\\" will hold your interest and haunt you long after you have set it down for the last time.	2005-05-04

Even when \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" (graphic novel and film) convened a who's who of these super-heroes, Sherlock Holmes was excluded for he was in a league of his own.     From \\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\" (1974) of Nicholas Meyer (where Sigmund Freud works with Sherlock) to the current Mary Russell series of Laurie King (where Sherlock finds a brilliant feminist mate), the fun has been reading of the new situations that Sherlock finds himself placed in while staying true to the canon created by Arthur Conan Doyle. Mitch Collin's contribution to the genre is imaging Sherlock as a 93 year old in the aftermath of World War II.    It is an entertaining read which aspires to a poignant ending. The writing is clear and crisp without a misstep. The creative difference is Holmes pondering his inner emotional life in the twilight of his days. The reader does not need to be a Sherlock Homes fan to appreciate this novel. Afterwards the reader may want to consult Leslie Klinger's \\"The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes\\" (2004) which contains all 56 of the short stories to see if Mr. Cullin got the details right. I believe that he did.	2005-05-01

Before writing her two current novels, she was an author of several Christian books: \\"When The Heart Waits\\"(1990) and \\"God's Joyful Surprise\\" (1987). Her religious books asked the difficult questions concerning life that other Christian fare would normally miss -- hence it is no surprise that her new novel, \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" deals with the difficult questions that other novelists avoid.    \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" examines love from many perspectives: married life and obligations, an erotic and spiritual affair, parental love and the comfort of an old homestead. I love this book because choices need to be made and the choices are not always clear-cut.     American popular fiction rarely deals with the inner spiritual life --- this is a novel that integrates the spiritual with the mundane of our lives. After the reader finishes this novel, go out and read her other books. They are just as good.	2005-04-06

For the reader who has little knowledge of the background of the Crusades, Mr. Tyerman gives a big picture overview of Christian Europe's many military operations (1095-1464 AD) to retake Jerusalem from the Muslim Arabs (who had conquered the Holy Land by 640 AD).     The writing is a readable synthesis of the diverse research he has undertaken for this book. Mr. Tyerman ties together our Crusader past with its impact upon our present day world and debunks popular myths in his concluding chapter.    For the reader who desires to read further upon the topic, I recommend Sir Steven Runciman's three volume (and 1,400 pages) magisterial epic upon the Crusades. Though published between 1951-1954, \\"A History of the Crusades\\" is a masterwork of popular writing. Jonathan Phillip's \\"The Fourth Crusade and the Sack Of Constantinople\\" is a more detail account of a crusade gone berserk.	2005-04-04

Eastern Greek Orthodox	The Fourth Crusade was a disaster for the unity of Christianity. The rivalry between the Roman Catholic Church (and backed by the various kingdoms) in the West and the Greek Orthodox Church (and backed by the Greek Byzantine Empire) in the East had been simmering for two centuries. A common foe against the Islamist conquest of the Holy Land kept expediency in the forefront for the Latin West and the Greek East until the Fourth Crusade.    Instead of liberating Jerusalem, the knights and seamen of the West became embroiled in financial troubles and internal Byzantine politics. By the time the complex double-dealing was done, the Christian West had sacked Constantinople, the capital of the Christian East. Unity was out of the question forever more.     Mr. Philips has written an impressive and readable account of the Fourth Crusade for the lay reader. A more academic approach is \\"The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople\\" (1997) by Donald Queller and Thomas Madden. Of their 357 pages, over half belongs to a detail and lively narrative of medieval politics and the remaining 150 pages are devoted to an extensive bibliography and readable footnotes. A historical sequel is \\"The Fall of Constantinople\\" (1965) by Sir Steven Runciman about the conquest of the city of Constantine in 1453 by the Turks.	2005-04-04

He was a man adrift, without a goal or purpose for the first time in his life.    Once you have achieved your career goal (for him, the Presidency at age 42), what do you do for an encore? According to Ms. O'Toole, TR tried to repeat himself with a failed, but close, run for the White House in 1912 and was comtemplating another bid in 1920 when he died in his sleep from an embolism in 1919.    The research is good, though I disagree with some of her conclusions, especially her view of TR needing power and doing anything to achieve it. Her difficulty lies in writing the concluding chapter of TR's life without having written of his first fifty years.     In some 1600 pages, Edmund Morris has written an epic biography of TR's life in a trilogy : the pre-White House period (\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" which won the Pulitzer Prize) and the White House years (\\"Theodore Rex\\"). The concluding volume covering the post-White House years has yet to be published. For now, Ms. O'Toole's book will have to do.  As an aside, Sylvia Morris (married to Edmund Morris) has written her own biography of Roosevelt's wife, \\"Edith Kermit Roosevelt.\\"	2005-03-21

She was my mentor. Morton's memoir of their marriage is touching, well-written and a quick read.     My only regret is that Morton glossed over Milly's wonderful gift as a social worker/therapist in a paragraph, for that was her career identity. Milly did her own mourning when she had to cease her private practice due to her illness. Still the book gives you a taste of her personality, one of those persons who were larger than life.    \\"Saving Milly\\" achingly illustrates the struggle of a family who must care for a loved one through a long term illness and raises the question of politics, funding and ethics for those with incurable illnesses.

But her need to understand that temptation lead her to interview over 150 women who cheated on their husbands. This is her book.    \\"Undressing Infidelity\\" is not a definitive research project for family therapists nor does it wrap the various stories into a unified cheating on marriage theory. The book does reflects the diversity of a woman's need for emotional attachment, attention and passion. Frankly some of these men had it coming with their inattentive or controlling behaviors -- but other men did not, as life's many challenges (kids, money pressures, illnesses) got into both partner's ways. Some women paid a price for their infidelity - others did not.     The book is a quick read but it will set you thinking on the state of your own relationship. The book should be read by couples together, married or not. The reader is referred to \\"Uncoupling\\" by Frances Vaughan or any of family therapist Frank Pittman's writings on infidelity (especially \\"Private Lies\\") for further reading.	2005-02-27

As the political boss of New York, he worked himself into the presidency with an impressive resume: secretary of state, ambassador to England, senator, vice president. Then his career came to a screeching halt. <br /> <br />As a conservative who believed in the supremacy of states' rights over federal intervention, President Van Buren played a minimum role in the depression of 1837 or the disputes over slavery. He was a politician who did not led and lost the 1840 election as a result.  <br /> <br />This brief book (200+ pages) has the refreshing advantage of being written by a political operative (Mr. Widmer was a member of the Clinton Admnistration) who understands the practice of politics. It is well-written and to the point. However this is not the definitive biography of Martin Van Buren -- for that honor, the reader is directed to the 700+ pages biography by John Niven (1983).	2005-02-27

James B. Stewart has won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the corruption and hubris of the business community (for Mr. Stewart's writing at its best, see his \\"Den of Thieves\\"). \\"Disneywar\\" is his history of the 20 year reign of Michael Eisner as CEO of the Disney Company, culminating in a corporate high noon showdown between Mr. Eisner and Roy Disney.    Though the book could have been trimmed a bit, Mr Stewart presents a thorough account of how the finished Disney product that the reader knows (whether it is \\"The Lion King\\", the theme parks, et al) came to be. Why Mr. Eisner should granted such unprecedented access to Mr. Stewart is still unclear to me, for his public image will take a further tumble with the release of this book.    The reporting is impressive, the writing is clear and the behind the history tale is interesting. It is a fun read with the financial details make understandable for the non-MBA reader. A prequel of sorts is \\"Storming The Magic Kingdom\\" by John Taylor (1987) which tells the story of the corporate raiders who attempted to take over the Disney Company in the early 1980's.	2005-02-21

This coffee-table size book is no different from the other books in this American history series.     Well-written and lavished with rare and numerous photos, it tells more the story of an era through the career of boxer Jack Johnson. The one constant theme of the many joint projects between Mr. Ward and Mr. Burns is race -- and they explore the life of this attention-seeking boxer (similiar to Mohammed Ali a half century later) to examine the everyday racism present in the early 1900's.    This is not the definative biography of Jack Johnson -- for that the reader must go elsewhere for dates and boxing lore. Nor is it the interpretive account of the man (though they come close)--for that the reader should either read the play or view the 1970 James Earl Jones bio film, \\"The Great White Hope\\" (now out on DVD). But if the reader is interested in the history and attitudes of Americans in the first half of the 20th century as seen through the life of Jack Johnson, then this is your book.	2005-02-06

Whereas Mr. Greenblatt was creating a life of William Shakespeare based on very meager documention, Terry Jones and his co-authors are speculating on the death of Geoffrey Chaucer where NO documentation exists at all of his death. Chaucer just disappears from the public record in 1400.     This book benefits from both Mr. Jones days as a Monty Python member and his prior research books on the Middle Ages. It is extremely readable and entertaining, regardless of the unprovable supposition that Chaucer was possibly murdered for political reasons.     This book should be called \\"Chaucer: His Life, His Works, His World\\" but Donald Howard had already claimed that title for his fine 1987 biography of Chaucer. Mr. Jones went for a more marketable title, suggesting a murder mystery where no proof exists even of the year of Chaucer's death. At 416 pages, it is 200+ pages shorter than Mr. Howard's work (who focused more attention upon an analysis \\"The Canterbury Tales\\").    Regardless of the alleged murder, this book is worth reading for its solid research, beautiful illustrations and readable writing style (the reader should see the Amazon excerpt via the Search Inside feature to see if they agree).

In this definative new biography, Mr. Crowe has done impressive research in uncovering new archives and interviews to depict the Nazi spy/businessman who became a \\"righteous gentile\\" in saving Jews from certain death during World War II. Mr. Crowe is a Holocaust historian who has documented other Nazi atrocities in his 1996 work, \\"A History of the Gypies in Eastern Europe and Russia.\\" <br /> <br />The reader will be surprised to learn that Oskar Schindler had nothing to do with the creation of the life-giving lists that gave the title to the film by Steven Spielberg and the book by Thomas Keneally. Schnidler was in prison briefly when the lists were created by other persons. This does not diminished the other heroic acts that Schindler and his wife performed to save the Jews they came in contact with during the final two years of the World War II. He spent his war-profiteering fortune on bribes and supplies for those Jews in his care.  <br /> <br />It is sad that in the the madness of the Holocaust Oskar Schindler found the only success of his life. After the war, it was all downhill for the alcoholic womanizer who died in poverty in 1974. The book is very well-written and will interest those readers who desire to know what was the reality behind Schindler's List. <br /> <br />	2004-11-24

Once again, the LOA has performed their usual impressive work of scholarship and quality craftsmanship. <br /> <br />The first five volumes comprised his classics and well known short stories, novels and essays. With this volume, the reader is introduced to five of his least famous novels. The Gilded Age was his first novel (1873) and the only one he ever collaborated with another writer on (Hartford neighbor Charles Warner). The other four books were written toward the end of his career (from the 1890's on).  <br /> <br />Three of the novels were sequels : \\"The American Claimant\\" was itself a successor to \\"The Gilded Age\\" as it follows the further misadventures of Colonel Sellers; \\"Tom Sawyer, Abroad\\" and Tom Sawyer, Detective\\" continues the exploits of Tom and Hucklebery Finn. The final book, \\"The Mysterious Stranger\\" was never published in Twain's lifetime as it reflects the tragic darkness of his family life with it dark haunting gloom. <br /> <br />This volume is a must for the Mark Twain fan (along with the other five LOA volumes of his writings). While I do not consider this collection to be Mark Twain at his best, even Mark Twain at 3/4 strength is better than most other writers at their peak. The humorous satire of human nature (and of politics in the first two novels) is present in all five books.	2004-11-20

Mr. Kauffman has written history in the style of a novel without sacrificing accuracy or stretching the boundaries of probabilities.    This is the best single description that I have ever read of the night that Lincoln was murdered, at the moment of his greatest glory with the Civil War winding down with the surrender of General Lee earlier in the week. Most of the previous assassination/conspiracies accounts have centered upon Lincoln, with John Wilkes Booth as the mysterious off-stage actor. Mr. Kauffman has written for this generation the definitive story of how Lincoln came to die, with this prominent actor pulling the various strings to accomplish his goal.    \\"American Brutus\\" has all the usual suspects (Mary Surrat, Dr. Mudd, David Herold, et al) being manipulated in the elaborate web that Wilkes has weaved for the Confederate cause. One comes away with a sense of what it was like to live in the Washington D.C. region during the Civil War. Current residents (and future visitors) of that region will especially enjoy this book (with its maps) and be able to re-trace Wilkes' escape route, tour Ford's Theater and see the locations where the plotting occurred.    Mr Kauffman had performed exhaustive research without cramming all of it down the throat of the reader. This is a book that a non-reader of history will enjoy and a likely nominee for next year's Pulitzer's Prize for history.	2004-11-03

It is a story of one person's survival in the bizarre world that Hussein created during his two decade rule of Iraq.    Mahdi Obeidi gives his perspective of only one facet of the various weapons of mass destruction which Hussein was procuring. It was fascinating to learn that he received an American college education (Colorado School of Mines) before his eventual involvement with the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commision at its birth. Once Hussein comes to power, his accidental career choice (he never grew up dreaming of nuclear physics) became a near deadly career choice.     The antidotes of creating and then hiding a covert nuclear program is the heart of the book -- one is back in the world of spycraft and not the world of nuclear fusion. After the fall of Baghdad, Mr. Obeidi cooperated with the American military intellience in handing over the existing documents hidden in his garden (hence the title of the book) -- his co-author acted as a intermediary for both sides in the handing over of the documents. As a reward, Mr. Obeidi and his family were allowed to live in the United States.	2004-10-31

Mr. Ybarra wants to explain how the New Deal of the 1930's indirectly lead to the Red Scare of the 1950's. He uses the political career of Senator Pat McCarran of Nevade to highlight his thesis. He traces the early days of this now-forgotten Senator to concentrating on the post-war years.    Democratic Senator McCarran (1876-1954) was the worker ant of anti-Communist legislation in contrast to his better known counterpart Republican Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. Corrupt and a law only to himself, Senator McCarran answered to no one and acted as he saw fit to do.     This biography is well-written but long (over 800+ pages) with a lot of legislative details and cultural background of the 1950's. Frankly some of this material has very little to do with McCarran's life and can be skimmed without losing any of the story. Overall, for the reader with a political interest, I recommend this book as a primer on American politics.	2004-10-31

A previous recipient of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for his American Revolutionary histories, he has expanded upon a brief essay of Washington included in his \\"Founding Brothers.\\" <br /> <br />This is not an in-depth day-by-day account of Washington's life. For that pleasure, I refer the reader to the definitive four volume set (and 1,800+ pages) published over 30 years ago by James Thomas Flexner. Even Mr. Flexner's one volume abridgement is more detailed (at 400 + pages) than Mr. Ellis' new biography (only 275 pages of narrative).  <br /> <br />The difference lies in Mr. Ellis' big picture approach and his interpretation of key events during Washington's lifetime. So Washington's love of Sally Fairfax is restricted to a mere two pages and his estate at Mount Vernon gathers more ink than his tranquil marriage to Martha. Instead \\"His Excellency\\" focuses upon the impact that Washington's decisions had upon the course of American history. Overall this is a well-written and thoughtful introduction to the life of George Washington.	2004-10-26

Excluding \\"Once In A Lifetime\\", all of his plays were made into movies by Hollywood (with \\"You Can't Take It With You\\" winning the Oscar for Best Picture in 1938).    Since Mr. Kaufman's humor is firmly rooted in the era of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression for these plays, a little historical knowledge of that period goes a long way in enjoying them. The explanatory notes at the conclusion of this collection clarifies the numerous topical references within each play.     This volume is best read one play at a time (usually less than a 100 pages per play) and then the reader can enjoy the film production of the play. The quality of his writing can be seen by the actors/actresses drawn to portray his characters in the movies: James Stewart, Jean Harlow, Kate Hepburn, Frederic March, Betty Davis, Lionel Barrymore and so many more. Mr. Kaufman's comedies are no more dated than the plays by William Shakespeare.	2004-10-25

Well-written and researched, the narrative itself is over 800 pages with 300 pages of documentation and indexes. This is not the book for a reader who is seeking an introduction to the subject -- it is more an encyclopedia for the reader who enjoys the nuts and bolts of spycraft.    The book covers the tactics of all the Allies and Axis powers, focusing on the brilliant exploits of the masters of the game, the British. One of Mr. Holts thesis's is that the Allied sucess in the use of military misinformation gave them a major tactical advantage over the Germans, Japanese and Italians (as was proven in the sucess of the D-Day invasion and other operations).     This is the book for the serious WW II scholar who seeks information on this little known (and written about) topic. The sheer volume of characters, events and facts is a testament to the research skills of Mr. Holt who waded through thousands of recently declassified government documents. For the causal reader, \\"The Deceivers\\" is best read as a novel for those specific sections of interest to the reader : covering the French efforts in this area under Charles de Gaulle, or the American ruses in the Pacific or the complicated deceptions involved in the Normandy invasion.	2004-10-23

Now in her mid-40's, Ms. Bentley's formative experiences were with her distant father and her years with George Balanchine at the New York City Ballet. \\"Winter Season: A Dancer's Journal\\" was her painful account of establishing a new identity apart from the all-consuming world of the NYC Ballet. Now she writes of her quest to create a viable sexual identity for herself.    This focus upon issues of sexuality is nothing new for Ms. Bentley. She wrote a cultural history of a striptease known as the Dance of the Seven Veils in her \\"Sisters of Salome\\" (2002). She is an accomplished writer though she occassionally goes over the top.    The reader should be warned that this memoir is emotionally and sexually graphic as Ms. Bentley focuses upon her newly discovered obsession with sodomy. If the reader is uncomfortable with being a voyeur inside Ms. Bentley's bedroom, then this book is not for you.    For Ms. Bentley, she has finally found a form of sexual liberation for her masochistic and self-abasement tendencies. With her personal sexual surrender, she attributes a freeing up of a lifetime of inhibitions, releasing anger toward her father, and discovering a spiritual union with \\"Paradise.\\"    \\"The Surrender\\" is a very intimate and searingly honest account of one woman's search for personal peace. It is difficult to be this honest about one's sexual neediness with a lover or with a best friend -- Ms. Bentley just published her sexual neediness for the world to read.	2004-10-12

Utilizing his years living in Jerusalem & his personal knowledge of bibical Israel and the Mediterranean world that Paul inhabited, he has written a brief but engaging reconstruction of Paul's life and theology.    Father Jerome takes issue with traditional Pauline scholarship as he re-interprets Paul's letters and Luke's Acts of the Apostles. He advocates for a more worldly Paul and fills in the considerable gaps of his personal life with bold deductions (Paul's parents were slaves, Paul was married, his children later died in an accident, etc). His views on Paul's theology are more mainstream but fused with his knowledge of that era.    This book is geared toward the general reader and could be read in tandem with the recent publication of Bruce Chilton's \\"Rabbi Paul\\" which represents a more traditional outlook of Paul. For those readers wanting to dig deeper into Paul's life and theology, the earlier and more detailed works of Gunther Bornkamm and E.P. Saunders are still available.	2004-10-07

In 400+ pages, Mr. Greenblatt reconstructs the playwright's life out of the merest of clues, for Shakespears lefted very little  documentation behind of his life. Legal papers concerning his birth, marriage, children's births and his death constitute the bulk of the surviving documents from that era.    The reader is cautioned that \\"Will In The World\\" is a tour de force of conjecture. Mr. Greenblatt may be making an educated and deductive guess but still a guess about the very large gaps of our knowledge of Shakespeare's life. Having said that, the book is so well-research and well-written that it is a nominee for the National Book Award. It is a wonderful introduction to the world of Shakespeare and Elizabethan England.	2004-10-04

Johnson: Portrait of a President	Books	4	52	55	N	N	Best Single Volume Biography of LBJ	Robert Dallek has abriged his two volume set (nearly 1,500 pages) down to 400+ pages. Mr. Dallek is a solid writer and researcher. His biography will give you a sense of LBJ as a person and a politican, his accomplishments and his life & times. This will remain as the best single-volume biography available to the reader. So if reading just one book on LBJ is your goal, then this is your book.    Having said that, I wish to encourage the reader to explore either Mr. Dallek's original set or the never-ending magnum opus of Robert Caro (three volunes and over 2,700 pages so far). For better or for worse, LBJ was second only to FDR for his domination and impact upon the American political scene in a 40 year career that stretched from the 1930's to the 1960's. LBJ had an outsized personality and ambitions that was his strength and, ultimately, his weakness. Although Mr. Dallek does a excellent job in condensing his prior work, no single volume can ever do justice to the life of LBJ.     Personally, I prefer Robert Caro's massive, and sometimes, exhaustive work (his current three books only cover LBJ up to 1960, the same time period for Mr. Dallek's original first volume). Mr. Caro is a wonderful storyteller (somewhat akin to William Manchester) and you are swept away in his epic tale of LBJ. In deciding what to read, it really comes down to how much time and how much interest the reader has in the life of Lyndon Baines Johnson.	2004-10-01

In both books, Mr. Chilton emphasizes the Jewishness of his subjects in his quest for the historical person. This work does not break new ground but pulls together the leading scholarship consensus on Paul.    This work is intended for the general reader as an introduction to Paul's life and evolving theology -- it is thorough but concise at 350+ pages. Working from Paul's letters to the leaders of the local churches and from the Acts of the Apostles, Mr. Chilton emphasizes how Paul was responsible for broadening the faith in Jesus as the Messiah to including gentiles without the burden of the Law (the dietary rules and circumcision requirements). Among Paul's many contributions to Christian theology, this was the key one -- when the Jewish-Christian Church based in Jerusalem disappeared during the chaos of the War against Rome in the late 60's, the Gentile Church remained to carry on.     For a different approach toward Paul, the reader can read Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's \\"Paul: His Story\\". Utilizing the same framentary material as Mr. Chilton, Mr. Murphy-O'Connor argues for a more unique and sometimes creative history of Paul. I prefer Mr. Chilton's less-daring but more probable account of the life of Paul. For a more advanced look at Paul, the reader can consult the earlier works of either E.P. Saunders or Gunther Bornkamm.	2004-09-28

The authors take a different tack from other \\"what if\\" musings of history (those of Harry Turtledove, Ward Moore, et al) by arguing that even a Union defeat at Gettysburg would not guarantee an immediate Confederate victory in the Civil War. Their thesis (so far) is that the North's superiority in industializtion and population would still checkmate the South.<br /><br />The authors basically move up Grant's 1864 transfer from the  Western theater of military operations to the East after the crisis created by the defeat of the Army of the Potomac. The book follows events during the summer of 1863 when Lee attempts to seize Washington, D.C. & Baltimore and end the war once & for all before Grant can strike back.<br /><br />Overall, the descriptions of the behaviors/choices of the various generals and politcians ring true (although I had a difficult time with the transformation of James Longstreet into the second coming of Stonewall Jackson). Their depiction of Dan Sickles political manipulations & military impulsiveness is within his historical character and his fate on the battlefield will remain etched in your memory long after the novel ends.<br /><br />For the Civil War novice, this book will be a fun page-turner. For the serious student of the Civil War, there will be much to debate of the author's assumptions and premises. Would Grant really strip the Western theater of most of their soldiers to create a new Army of the Susquehanna? Would Lincoln really appoint Dan Sickles as the new commander of the Army of the Potomac?<br /><br />The novel is well-written and well-researched. This is the first alternative Civil War work that illustrates and focuses upon the the superiority of Union logistics over the Confederacy. Hopefully, the third volume of the series will be as good when it appears next year to follow the fictional events of the fall of 1863 when Grant's army of westerners takes on Lee's army of depleted veterans.onal events of the fall of 1863 when Grant's army of westerners takes on Lee's army of depleted veterans.	2004-09-27

This is the 8th installment of the massive alternative history epic by Harry Turtledove. The series spans from 1862 in \\"How Few Remain\\" and ends with a cliff-hanger ending in 1942 in the current volume.  <br /> <br />Mr. Turtledove assumes that Lee wins a decisive victory at Antietam and America splits into two separate nations. The Confederates win the rematch war in the 1880's and the USA defeats the South in World War I (with the aid of the German Empire). Now the series takes a turn and Mr. Turtledove clearly has the South standing in for Nazi Germany during the last trilogy. <br /> <br />This new volume opens with the CSA launching a surprise invasion of the North in 1941 and launching World War II. The enjoyment of these books is to see how Mr. Turtledove's imagination works on the changes if we were two nations : as a Southerner, General Patton would be a commander for the CSA, New York Governor Al Smith is the Socialist President of the USA, the racist South has concentration camps for African-Americans and so forth.  <br /> <br />Earlier books had historical figures as well-drawn major characters (Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, Custer, Teddy Roosevelt) which was half the fun of reading them. \\"Settling Acounts\\" has MacArthur, FDR and others as brief guest stars which is a lost opportunity for this series in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Mr. Turtledove is not a wordsmith but he is a good storyteller and the map showing the American continent divided into two nations will set you thinking. Because this novel opens without any of the history of the previous 80 years and only alludes to it, I recommend that the reader start at the begining with \\"How Few Remain\\" before reading this volume. One can read this novel on its own merits but the reader would miss the layers of richness that has gone before it. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-15

Every character is fully-realized and the plot flows without being tedious.  <br /> <br />   If you enjoy fantasy novels, you will read this book straight thru and regret when it comes to an end. Do not skip her faux-scholarly footnotes where her gift for dead-pan humor shines.

This complilation of two previously published scholarly articles focuses on whether the New Testament call Jesus God and on how much fore-knowledge Jesus had on life, his mission, and the future.    Written during the era of the death of God debate, Ray Brown is confined by Catholic theology (he pays homage to Protestant scholarship) but does a fine job of working around traditional conservative critics of bibical scholarship. This work is not as well written nor as accessible as his later works. It is dated in terms of current scholarship and would not be of much interest to a lay person (unless they enjoy obscure discussion of Greek terminolgy).     For a better enjoyment of the range and richness of his writing as a scholar, I would recommend his later books on the Gospel of John and his epic studies on the birth and death of the Messiah.They are written for the pastor as well as for the lay person. This period piece of the 1960's is strictly for a seminarian or a history of religion buff. Ray Brown died in 1998.	2004-08-31

More important it is well-written and Manchester tells the story masterfully. Macarthur dominates the Pacific theater of World War II (unlike the various generals in the European sector: Ike, Patton, Montgomery, Bradley, et al) and Manchester shows why.    The author views MacArthur through the lens of great men dominating history (rather than inevitable social movements defining History). Through World War I, World War II and the Korean War, MacArthur's personal & heroic bravery and intuitive genius at waging war is at the forefront.    Nearly 600 pages covers the decade between 1941 and 1951 where his military genius for offensive operations shone in the Pacific against Japan and in Korea against the Chinese. Sandwich in the middle was his successful post-war reconstruction of Japan. Manchester does not spend much time on his childhood (the section covering his family roots in Scotland and the Civil War is longer) or his final years after his forced retirement by Truman.     Manchester discusses the many flaws of Macarthur (his narcissism, his hunger for glory, his inability to admit mistakes) without whitewashing his weaknesses, though his interpretation of those flaws is inevitably positive -- like his failure to foresee and prepare for Japanese (and later Chinese) surprise attacks on American forces under his command, which Manchester explains away by noting that no one else in the chain of command foresaw them either.    If you enjoyed the more recent \\"The Last Lion\\" (a bio of Churchill), then you will enjoy this earlier story of MacArthur. It is clear that Manchester likes MacArthur, in spite of his weaknesses and you will like this biography as well. There will be no more like it for William Manchester died earlier this year of complications from a stroke.	2004-08-20

It is the lesser known of the three novels, although Random Harvest is his most complete work.    The story is a romance, a mystery, a critque on England's class structure, and a parable. Hilton uses the lost years of Charles Rainier as a methaphor for the lost years of the 1920/1930's when England failed to prepare for the next war. Told in flashbacks and bookended by World War I and World War II, the resolution is only revealed in its final sentence that will shock you and change everything that you have just read & thought you understood. You will go back and re-read the book as your perception of all the characters are altered by the surprise ending.     Two cautions: First, see the 1942 Ronald Coleman/ Greer Garson movie AFTER reading the book to see how the ending is handled. Second, the opening few pages are set in an England and of a time that will be unfamiliar to most Americans, but if one continues on, the reader will be deeply rewarded. The ability to be surprised is a rare gift and Hilton delivers.	2004-08-20

The authors are playing a pallor game of challenging the reader to identify their many allusions and source material in their quest for a Unified Literature Theory. While being an English major is not a requirement, it certainly enhances the enjoyment of the book.    Two caveats -- First, the movie was only suggested by the graphic novels and does not resemble the plot or the mood of the story. Second, there are explicit scenes of sex that make this volume unsuitable for children (unlike volume 1). This is a shame because the author's vast source materials are all appropriate for children and teens. In fact, one can have a lark going back to read the many works referred in \\"The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\".	2004-08-19
