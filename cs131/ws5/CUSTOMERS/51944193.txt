This is my third governess story and I liked it the least.  But I REALLY liked the others. This one, to me, was good but not great.  I agree with Sarah's review.  Enid annoyed me.  Not only did I not like her name, I didn't really feel good about her.  She didn't want to leave Lady Halifax, but she did in the blink of an eye.  She really didn't want to kiss MacLean the first time, but she did in the blink of an eye.  She didn't want to make love (the first time), but she did in the blink of an eye.  Do you see the pattern?  Also, her excuses for not wanting to marry Kiernan were pretty lame.  After all said, I did just go out and by 'Rules of Surrender.'	2002-03-15

It was fun to go through an entire book in a short period of time and have fun during the whole time.  Though not a story with a lot of depth, it certainly kept my interest.  Young Verity is about to marry a much older man.  So, to have one taste of passion she decides to spend one night in Galen Bromney's bed.  Galen is a rake if there every one was, but he's not used to women coming unannounced and uninvited to his bedroom-especially a virgin.  It's one night of passion that changes Galen forever.  He goes to Italy for 10 years to 'find himself.'  When he returns he finds Verity at a ball he is attending--along with her 10 year old daughter who looks like a spitting image of himself.  Her husband (who she actually turned out to love-in almost a fatherly way) has been dead for two years.  After a confrontation, she admits the girl, Jocelyn, is his daughter.  The rest of the story involves his discovery of love and family and a villainous brother in law out for money and his sister-in-law.	2000-09-25

The heo is Hugh Dryden, a knight who was held prisoner for two years and feels unworthy of being alive because of his inprisonment and disfigurements from repeated torture.  He must select a wife however.  He come's highly recommended to Lady Marguerite, a wealthy, beautiful and proper woman.  Instead he falls in love with Lady Sian, a Tudor of royal though low birth who is full of life and on her way to a nunnery ( where she doesn't want to go).  She loves Hugh almost at first site, though it takes Hugh a little longer to realize that he loves her and they deserve each other.

Agravar saves Lady Rosamund from what he believes are kidnappers.  She is  in route to her betrothed, Robert, a man she has never met, but already  knows she won't be able to marry him.  Her step father has raised her to  believe she is weak mentally, morally, and physically.  She believes he  killed her mother as well as being a cruel and arrogant man.  The story  follows Rosamund's realization that all men aren't cruel and she isn't  weak.  In the process she falls in love with Agravar, though she ends up  married to Robert through trickery and threats.  The story goes on from  there.  I enjoyed this light read, only wishing at times that there was  more depth and development within the story.  I've enjoyed all of Ms  Navin's book and this one was no exception!	2000-06-28

It was fast paced and that may have been its only  problem.  The hero, Royce, hasn't had any dealings with his very young  daughter since her birth because she reminds him too much of his first wife  who died in childbirth.  But almost immediately after meeting the heroine,  Lynette, and seeing how she deals with his duaghter, he sees the light and  becomes close to her.  In the same breath, Lynette, isn't too impressed  with Royce on first meeting him, but with little explanation decides he's  the man for her.  Bottom line though, it was a great book.	1999-10-30

James has the patience of a  saint.  If I read one more chapter where Isabel humiliates James I think I  would have put the book down.  If you read the story you will also see that  the front cover gives a totally inaccurate picture of the hero.  Are the  cover artists or publishers afraid to show a less then perfect hero?	1999-10-23

Anne is for from perfect and she has a son many would view as 'the son of the devil' because he is deaf.  Through a series of events they are married and fall in love, with Edouard admitting his love early and Anne holding off because she hasn't told him her son is deaf. Its nice to read a story where the hero and heroine are not the usual young and naive.  Anne is in her late 20's and Edwouard is a little older.  Of course both have their secrets and each is hurt when they discover that the other has been holding back on the other.	1999-09-26

Well, Katherine wants no part of a marriage, her father was  nothing to brag about and her betrothed, Lord Hanley, hasn't been seen in  years and she hated him when he was around.  The marriage takes place and  though there are more than enough misunderstandings, the only big obstacle  to their happiness turns out to be Kieran, Katherine's rogue cousin, who  shows up impersonating Hanley.

King David figures out a way to solve two problems: reward his champion and marry off the heiress of a seaside keep.  The problem is neither one is excited about the idea.  The champion, Lord Lion, has a mistress he wants  to marry but the thought of the land that comes with the heiress helps sway  him.  The heiress (Mellyora) however, has always had her way, and wants no  part of Lord Lion.  Lion realizes early on that he REALLY likes Mellyora  but it takes her most of the book to realize that she REALLY likes Lion  too.  I'd take Lion any time and I wanted to shake Mellyora to bring her to  her senses.  Maturity is not one of her virtures.

Though her parents die and her brother is smitten by a real witch (b) she is taken in by loving nuns.  Ready to take her final vows she is called to dying  brother's side (poisoned by his wife).

Elf brings out the good Merin and she is returned  unharmed to her husband and son.  I have certainly read better stories,  especially by Ms Small.  Certainly not pornographic it is graphic (but in  my opinion, mild for Ms Small).  Elf is angelic, Ranulf is a saint, the  widow has no redeeming qualities.

It was refreshing to read about two souls in love with other, but fearing their partner did not reciprocate.  Julianna needs a savior (Edmond)to take her from her cruel  stepbrother, Jerome.  But her fiance, Crispin, is away on a sea voyage (and  what I saw of him later, he should have stayed away).  Crispin's older  uncle saves Julianna by marrying her, keeping her chaste, to wait Crispin's  return.  Not surprisingly the couple fall in love but they don't share  their thoughts and most of the rest of the book involves their thoughts of  love and what the other would do if their partner knew their true feelings.   This was not a long book, but to me it was just the right length for an  overnight read.  Any longer and it would have become tedious and I would  have run out of patient with the couple not realizing their love for each  other.  It was a breath of fresh air.	1999-04-25
