Michael Michalko, I'm the author of the creative thinking books &quot;Thinkertoys&quot; and &quot;Cracking Creativity&quot; and have known Peter Lloyd for many years. Peter is a contributor to Marco Marsan's &quot;Think Naked&quot; and encouraged me to review it. This book is an excellent guide on how to become creative and alive again.<br />We see people who are wonderfully alive and people who are depressed and defeated every day. Once, on a rainy Sunday afternoon, in a caf&eacute; in Old Montreal I saw a woman rise from her table and for no reason started to sing opera. She had a certain smile and I knew she was perfectly at home with herself. She was wearing a great wide hat, her arms were flung out in an expansive gesture, singing, and utterly oblivious to everything but what was in her and around her at that second. Even as you read this, you are thinking of people you know who are alive and people who are lifeless.<br />This woman was wonderfully alive and self-creating. When you meet a person like the woman in Montreal you get this vague feeling inside you that you \\"ought to be\\" something more. You already know this feeling. We get this feeling when we recognize the thing in others that we long to be. This feeling seems so trivial, so fundamental that we ought to be like that, that we dare not admit it to others. We long to become more alive and creative in our personal and business lives. The feeling for it is the most primitive feeling which a person can have. The feeling for it is as primitive as the feeling for your own well being.<br />&quot;Think Naked&quot; will help you become what you ought to be. It reminded me to dance every day if only in my mind.	2003-07-29

However, upon reflection, it's sort'of simplistic. I'm sure it has a value for people who love to define the undefinalbe. As for me, there are a lot  more definitive books out there.	1999-10-05
