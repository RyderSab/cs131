I also enjoyed the book's scientific biography <BR>aspects, those who like that genre will enjoy this book.<br />I found it interesting that, given all the DMT drug experience anecdotes, there were<BR>     no zen experience anecdotes in the book.  He is quite reticent about<BR>     his own meditation 'experiences', or even of the value of zen practice<BR>     for himself, personally.  Which is perhaps understandable, but if he was going to discuss his own personal religion at all, I wished he had addressed that aspect, even briefly, at least.<br />     There is an interesting story of how zen as an institution reacted against<BR>     his medical researches with DMT and formally 'denounced' him in a way,<BR>     especially after he published an article in Tricycle in 1996.  It is a<BR>     textbook case, perhaps, of Jung's dictum that 'Religion is a defense against<BR>     the religious experience'.  Even though, as he points out, many of the senior<BR>     officials in the zen hierarchy were psychedelic veterans, having been <BR>     inspired to enter zen practice via psychedelics.<br />     But, on the whole, there is not much enlightening in this book when<BR>     it comes to religion, it seems to me.  The 'experiences' I have read so<BR>     far seem to be in the 'wow, man, far out' variety, and dont illuminate<BR>     any Dharma teaching.  e.g. an account of being raped anally by crocodiles,<BR>     phew.<br />     Also, it was kind of surprising there is no mention of kundalini<BR>     as far as I can see, even though he discusses chakras and makes<BR>     the connection of the pineal to the crown chakra.  Apparently, DMT<BR>     does not stimulate kundalini, which is kind of interesting in itself.<br />     The most interesting part of the book for me is that he actually<BR>     takes the Many-Worlds physical viewpoint seriously as an <BR>     explanation of the repeated emphasis on the volunteers denying<BR>     they had an illusory 'experience', and insist on its actual reality.<br />     Strassman even contacted physicist David Deutsch and recounts some<BR>     exchanges with him discussing these ideas.  <br />     All in all, a stimulating book, and a worthy companion to TIHKAL, PIHKAL and<BR>     'Acid Dreams', and 'Storming Heaven', and 'Nothing on My Mind',<BR>     and 'Science Synchronicity and Soul-Making', and 'Dancing<BR>Naked in the Mind-Field'	2003-12-24

Anyone skeptical of the connection between cannabis and psychosis must read this book.  It is a warning to all those susceptible, if pot makes you feel 'paranoid', STAY AWAY from it, it WONT get any better, and could get a WHOLE lot worse.<br /><br />Mark Vonnegut gives us a valuablecase study of a young person who had natively intuited and systematatically explored synchronicity for some years prior to his episodes of schizophrenia. It makes me wonder - how much the onset of his illness was due to this practice of his cultivating synchronicity.  And how much the debilitating nature of the illness was due to the anxiety that resulted when it manifested more and more.  I wonder if in a culture that accepted and understood the phenomenon more, would he have not suffered as much?<br /><br />There are so many similarities in the neurological metanoia/metamorphosis transformation of schizophrenia and mysticism, it seems so clear to me they must be very close together on the spectral distribution of human ways of being.<br /><br />To the handful of readers who are interested in these aspects of consciousness, I would recommend Victor Mansfield's 'Science Synchronicity and Soul Making', and Louis Sass's 'Madness and Modernism'.<br /><br />Oh well, disregarding all that metaphysical blather, Vonnegut's eloquent descriptions of the despair of modern life as seen from the eyes of a 20 year old make the book a timeless classic of cultural criticism, it seems to me.  It brings to mind Jon Krakauer's story of Chris McCandless - 'Into The Wild'.	2001-07-23

Ronald Hayman's excellent biography of Nietzsche to get some idea of the context in which Nietzsche wrote this work.  <br />As Hayman describes it, it appears this book reflects a kind of genuine religious epiphany/satori experience Nietzsche had while hiking the trails of Sils-Maria while in anguish over his failed relationship with Lou Salome and Paul Ree.  For that reason, I personally consider the book to be more scripture than philosophy.  Albeit, a scripture informed by the life and learning of an eminent philosopher in the classical tradition.<br />In this context, I see the book as the expression of the fruition of a true seeker's lifetime quest for truth and insight.<br />The two key concepts that are new in the book: the Ubermensch, and The Eternal Return, have been vastly misunderstood, to often horrific effect.  A result not entirely unforseen by Nietzsche himself, of course.<br />Personally, even though I was fortunate enought to have studied Nietzsche in college, I never quite grokked the 'eternal return' until I grokked the psychological device of the zen koan via reading Philip Kapleau's 'Three Pillars of Zen'. <br />It seems to me that the 'eternal return' fits in quite nicely with the koan tradition, being a 'what if' conundrum that just happened to grab Nietzsche in the right way and propelled him through the transformations he records here, in the later parts of 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'.<br />The questions the book challenges us to confront are the classic ones: 'what is it to be human', 'what is the potential of the human', 'what is the self and why is it to be overcome' etc etc<br />The sad and untold part of the book is the book's foreshadowing of Nietzsche's final kundalini awakening/epiphany, and subsequent collapse due to the overwhelming power of the kundalini energy, upon rescuing the flogged horse in the town square, in his story of the jester falling from the tightrope. <br />but ...'what matters all happiness?' indeed!	2001-07-19

Basically, two scientists get their hands on a new toy, a fancier type of CAT scan called 'SPECT'.  And, one of their colleagues happens to be a meditator of some degree of samadhi accomplishment.  So, why not scare up some funding to peer into his brain, eh?   <br />But are we supposed to be surprised that objective correlates to subjective samadhi states are actually found?  Evidently we are. Why, I have no idea.  <br />This seems to me, as a practising mystic myself, just yet another instance of scientists missing the whole point of religious experience.  <br />Though, to be fair, they do allow for more 'going on' than what they are measuring, they seem to have no clue as to  why Moses, Buddha, Jesus, or Mohammed et. al. would have exhorted their acolytes so strenuously to attain these peculiar brain states.  What could possibly be the imperative to traditional religious practise in this context, other than just to 'feel good'?<br />It seems scientists will continue to be embarassingly naive when delving into these realms with their fancy technological instruments which barely scratch the surface of the phenomenon. But at least, these two authors are consciously trying to be a tad humble in the face of the mysterium tremendum. <br />For those interested in filling in the gaps left by this book, allow me to recommend: 'Science Synchronicity and Soul Making' by Victor Mansfield, and 'Synchronicity' by F. David Peat.	2001-07-13

This book will have an honored place on my bookshelf next to Lama Govinda's 'The Way of the White Clouds', Lama David-Neel's 'Magic and Mystery in Tibet', John Blofeld's 'The Wheel of Life', and Peter Matthiessen's 'Nine Headed Dragon River'.  <br />It is a valuable record of the power and value of the Buddha Dharma for human life and endurance in this ocean-of-suffering world.<br />But as much as I loved the book and felt it to be perfect as it is, I was left wishing for more insight into the teachings of Tsung Tsai's teacher.  I surely hope that the omission of details about actual teachings is an indication of another book yet to come to complete this Dharma record.<br />The chapter on the wayward ex-student of Tsung Tsai's is quite unique, very powerful and disturbing.  Such an archetypal encounter seems lifted straight out of a Tolkien fantasy, yet it actually happened, amazing.  The seductive temptations of the tantric/kundalini power are so graphically depicted.  As well as the perennial worldly rewards of wealth and status to those infatuated with the charismatic aspects of spiritual power, in contrast to the poverty and renunciation of the true bhikku and their ministrations of healing power.  <br />Finally, I pay homage to the monks of Puuh Jih, 108 bows!

Unfortunately, the intimately personal daily journal format of the book makes it hard to avoid such an impression.  <br />But this book is valuable as Wilber has certainly sampled the full variety of the 1980's new-age spiritual awakenings and many of its characters and florid pseudo-scientific delusions.   (And, he has even made it cool to be bald!)<br />Personally, I am not too overwhelmed by the volume of Mr. Wilber's output.  Other prolific spiritual dilettante authors like Paul Brunton, Colin Wilson, and Thomas Cleary come to mind in comparison regarding the depth, range, and repetitiveness of Wilber's oeuvre.  One cannot fault them for milking the publishing gravy train.  I would certainly do the same, as it sure beats working.<br />Personally, I have been interested in Wilber's career ever since his excellent anthology 'Quantum Questions', and have long wondered why Ken Wilber and Fritjof Capra are not natural allies.  I was hoping this book might shed some light on that 'Quantum Questions' aspect of the 'new paradigm' movement that Wilber has been involved with through the last two decades, but was puzzled to find little discussion about it in this book.  <br />It seems to me both Capra and Wilber write and crusade on the same wavelength, yet it seems, judging by a few snide asides in the foreword to 'Quantum Questions', that Wilber perhaps resents Capra's 'The Tao of Physics' for upstaging the publication of Wilber's first opus 'The Spectrum of Consciousness' circa 1977-79.  <br />Capra got the accolades at the time due to his academic credentials and Heisenberg's imprimatur; whereas Wilber, with no such academic sheepskin, though perhaps more intuition and genius, was ignored in the wake of Capra's book, even though writing on the same (somewhat novel at the time) basic topic - the scientific foundations for religious modes of consciousness.<br />Interestingly, there is not one index entry for Fritjof Capra in this edition of Wilber's journals.  How the two can have avoided each other so completely even while touring in the carnival circuit of 1980's California new-age quantum holistic faires is beyond me.<br />Anyway, this book is certainly more than *I* ever wanted to know about Mr. Wilber's daily epiphanies, but I do really appreciate his honesty in clarifying for his readers his human side, and it helps to see how he 'walks the walk'.  <br />As well, he provides us by his example a good antidote to the tendencies of new-age guru worship.<br />Now, I would really like to see a similar book by the ultimate zen logorrheic, Dr. Thomas Cleary!	2001-06-26

Being a fan of author Peter Occhiogrosso's other book - 'Through the Labyrinth' - and having had some small experience of the vast love and power of the Holy Spirit myself - from listening to African American Gospel Music (by sister Dorothy Love-Coates et. al., 'THE GREAT 1955 SHRINE CONCERT' on Specialty CD# SPCD-7045-2) I was eager to read this book on the Holy Spirit.  <br />Especially so as this book focuses on the actual experience of the Holy Spirit as opposed to some abstract theorizing that the Holy Spirit is 'just' a metaphor etc.  This book is a good antidote for the devotees of the it's-all-just-a-metaphor theory!<br />Now having read most of it, I find it to be a valuable 'hands-on' (hehe) guide to prayer and study excercises designed to orient one to receiving this power in their life.  <br />It is not an exhaustive history or 'exegesis' (thank God!), but a very personal account of what one long-time minister, Ron Roth, has found to actually work in conveying the Holy Spirit to others.<br />I also appreciated Mr. Roth's descriptions of how common it is nowadays to feign or fake the experience of the Holy Spirit in contemporary American Christianity.  This explained a lot to me about the excesses of contemporary televangelism etc.<br />There are also many references in the book to other faiths and traditions, such as Rumi etc, which may turn off those of a fundamentalist bent, or those opposed to any tinge of 'New Age' ecumenicalism, but this may also encourage others, such as the fans of Matthew Fox or Thomas Merton.  <br />Though there is some discussion of the cross-faith experience of the Holy Spirit, as in Rumi, I dont recall him mentioning the kundalini experience per se, which many consider to be a different name for the same thing.<br />One other very minor detraction of the book for me, was the emphasis on a 'positive thinking / prosperity' message.  Those of us who suffer from depression (and who, God knows, could use the Holy Spirit's healing)may find themselves being 'put down' (though no doubt unintentionally) for their depression before they can find the healing they seek from the Holy Spirit.<br />I have read in the African-American Gospel music tradition that  depression can be a sign of seeking, such as in the descriptions of the 'Mourner's Bench' and being 'Heavy of heart' and feeling 'oppressed' (see the classic book 'God Struck Me Dead' by Johnson).  <br />So a more sympathetic treatment of the sufferers of depression (or 'loser's limp' as Mr. Roth calls it) might help Mr. Roth's message, in my very humble opinion.<br />After all, the Gospel music experience of 'Getting Happy' doesnt always come without a little time spent on the 'Mourner's Bench'!	2001-06-12

('Acid Dreams' and 'Storming Heaven').<br />The most valuable aspect of the book, and its main focus, is an oral walkthrough of a session with the therapist Jacob.  Mr. Stolaroff has done a valuable service in preserving Jacob's insights into what works and what doesnt work.<br />Though, I was confused when Jacob described his purely religious orientation to the therapy yet didnt elaborate hardly at all on his own 'theological' outlook or experiences.<br />Also, in my opinion, Jacob goes to an extreme in asserting at one point that transformation *requires* such entheogens.  He seems to unfairly discount the traditional religious retreat practices and experiences.<br />Personally, I side with the theory that such entheogens merely unveil latent faculties that can be cultivated by traditional retreat type practices without the need for entheogens at all.<br />Also, one danger, perhaps, in the outlook and process described in this book, is its almost complete lack of orientation to 'Right View' (in the Buddhist sense) as the precursor to 'awakening'.  The Buddha stressed that insight into Right View was a key prerequisite.  Yet, this therapy seems to presume it is largely irrelevant.<br />I would recommend Thaddeus Golas' 'The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment' as a complement to this book, as Golas himself broke through via entheogens, yet does not see them as absolutely necessary, and focuses on orienting to 'Right View' first as the means to awaken (his book is out of print, but available online now, search for the title in google).	2001-05-25

I can understand the validity of the author's attraction for psychiatry, as a means to exploit his training without having to actually touch patients, but his portrayal of it as actually being more curative than medicine is quite a stretch, and sounds like quite the rationalization.<br />The portrayal of the hyper analytic Freudian girlfriend as the means to his recovery of Shem's humanity, strikes me as an over the top rationalization of his resignation to their marriage.  She does not sound at all human in his characterization, and makes me wonder about the real-life counterpart to this character.<br />The one anecdote in the book that sounded to me like a true account of psychological healing was the mime show of Marcel Marceau.  If this book is ever made into a movie, this would make a wonderfully touching scene.  I have to believe it is based on an actual experience of the author's.<br />I noticed that some readers here seem to have been annoyed by the recurrent Irish cop characters, but I found them quite enjoyable figures, sort of Shakespearean characters who function as the observers of the story.<br />Overall, a fun read, and a valuable account of the reality of an important profession, occasionally marred by superfluous scenes. Given that, it's reputation as on a par with Catch-22 is quite deserved, in my opinion.<br />Laughter *is* the best medicine!	2001-05-23

Instead, we are presented with pedantic background material having to do with religion and biology which is widely available in thousands of other books, and perhaps 5 pages altogether of research reports.  And those 5 pages are not even contiguous!  As a result, I find myself quite skeptical of the author's hypothetical framework that he labors so hard to present in this work.  <br />There is at least one glaring omission as well - there is no discussion of the commonality of the kundalini experience among the major mystics, nor any background on the chakra system and its relation to the endocrine system.  To have ignored these topics in a book dedicated to 'probing' mysticism, is to be presented with a very shallow probe indeed.<br />This book is evidently intended as an undergraduate text for a narrowly focused survey class, and not for the general reader.	2001-05-21

Each moment is an instance of another Universe.&quot;)  Some acquaintance with physics and physicists has impressed upon me how little is really known about Time per se, as opposed to, for example, Gravity. (e.g. physicist Paul Davies' book 'About Time')<br />It is interesting, and even, ahem, enlightening (hehe), to me to listen to Zen master Dogen's essay 'Being-Time' after reading Eckhart Tolle. For example at the mp3.com artist site 'freedharma', there is a copy of Dogen's 'Being-Time' essay.

The most important of which, is perhaps that suffering in fact has an end.  A fact that I, for one, too often refuse to believe.<br />As an example of Mr. Tolle's direct style, here is how he states this Good News: &quot;Humankind as a whole has been through such vast suffering that one could almost say that every human has suffered enough now. No further suffering is necessary.&quot;<br />Another book as direct and powerful in its perennial insight as this one is &quot;The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment&quot; by Thaddeus Golas.<br />Personally, I see such books as valuable documents of the spontaneous experience of awakening.  But whether or not such an experience is any more or less contagious via the medium of these books as opposed to any of the more traditional practices - e.g. singing in choir, taking communion, or sitting on a cushion at 5 a.m. - is pretty dubious, it seems to me.  <br />&quot;Frying sesame seeds ...

Evidently the recent movie caused the republication.  Evidently also, Mannix originally was riding on the popularity of the 50's film 'Ben Hur'.  The more things change ...  Personally, I find Mannix's style quite refreshing.  It is not that far removed from the detective magazines of the 50's I would imagine.  He has a taste for the more lurid aspects of the phenomenon, but makes the point well that what was 'normal' to the Romans of that era would revolt many of us today.  i.e. the lurid parts of the book are not 'gratuitous' in the normal sense.  One really gets a feel for the depths of Roman decadence, and how what started out as a noble ceremony to honor one's dead father, decayed into spectacles of death and gambling for the drunken mob.  One can really believe that John the Revelator had the Romans in mind writing his Book of Revelation.  This kind of book appeals a lot to teenage boys, I would imagine, and it might be a good way to get them interested in history.  I found it very interesting and readable, a good way to acquaint oneself with some of the more interesting anecdotes from the classical writers, and the retelling of the preserved biography of an actual charioteer, Diocles, was truly fascinating.	2001-04-30

Suzuki as a means to understanding zen, then this book will be a mind-blower in its clarity!  Though be aware that it is primarily describing the Rinzai flavor of zen (intense retreats of induced mental breakdowns with the infrequent breakthrough), as opposed to the more relaxed Soto variety, a-la 'Zen Mind Beginner's Mind', which now seems to be the main zen sect in the USA.  The retreat accounts are valuable, but mislead one into thinking that all zennies experience such dramatic cathartic breakthroughs and that they are the be-all and end-all of Buddhism.  Such practices are really only ONE part of the Buddha's Eightfold Way.  The author's later books do help somewhat to correct the imbalance of this one, and the messianic enthusiasm of this one is quite understandable.  But one would do well to bone up on the Dhammapada and the Eightfold Way, via accesstoinsight.org, for example, as well.  Though, this book remains a truly groundbreaking work and has Transmitted the Light to many, and I suspect it will continue to do so for many many kalpas.	2001-04-30

(heheheheh)	&quot;in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.&quot;<br />indeed!<br />I find that the negative reviews listed here are quite instructive and worth reading.  It is worth realizing, for us westerners, that Buddhism has its sectarian squabbles over heresy and scripture just like any other religion.  As well as its own organizational byzantine structure and inertia just like any other church.<br />I can imagine that not a few devotees of Zen Mind Beginner's Mind have been dismayed at the disgust they were greeted with when naively and optimistically discussing Buddhism with some transplanted asian Theravadan monk.  (ahem, or was that just me? :)<br />That said, the book clearly comes from a deep place of understanding 'beyond the scriptures'.  Though, to my mind, I find it complements them quite well, assuming one understands that Suzuki's concept of 'Big Mind' is quite literally heretical in the Theravadan sect.  Personally, the biggest heresy in the book I find is in the 'God Giving' chapter - 'How can He [God] help their activity when He does not know who He is?'.  Phew!  Christians of all sects will vituperate over this heresy even more than Theravadans over 'Big Mind'.<br />Yet, the need for the mutual awakening of God *and* us, in order for God to awaken *to* us, is an old Gnostic tradition, it seems.  e.g. Read Kazantzakis'  'The Saviors of God' for more of this heresy.  Or, Matthew Fox's translation of Eckhart in 'Breakthrough'.<br />Meanwhile, it surely cant hurt to bone up on the suttas at, for example, accesstoinsight.org, even though Suzuki said 'it is not that important'.  Since surely he *wasnt* saying *never* read the suttas!<br />As always, take the Middle Way between the extremes!	2001-04-30

This book helps one to relate to it through the stories of those Chinese that Mr. Butterfield was able to talk to, not too long after the Cultural Revolution ended.  It really makes one think:  How does such a period of mass cultural insanity happen? Is it just a result of economics and youthful demographics?  Could it happen anywhere?

Some 2 years after having read and enjoyed this book, what has stayed with me is one simple saying of Suzuki roshi's that I hadnt encountered in other books, but which has lately seemed to me to be a deep insight into the reality of many-worlds: (but I wont spoil it for you, in stereotypical Zen fashion. :)  The comments by another reader about possible ADD symptoms ring a bell, and I wonder how much is due to the practice itself, which, after all, is quite abnormal in many respects.  This book reads very easily and is appropriately somewhat more reverent than 'Thank You and OK'.  I did think that the subject of Suzuki roshi's Dharma-heirs did not get enough attention, though it is understandable.  Yet, particularly in the Zen tradition, one's heirs seem to be as important, even more so, than the body of one's 'teachings'.  It would be valuable for Baker roshi, Sojun roshi, or Jakusho roshi, for example, to write their reminiscences as well, though Chadwick does have some anecdotes from them included here.  Anyway, this book will help a lot in demystifying the mystique of 'enlightenment', Zen or otherwise, the projection of which Zen teachers are perennially cursed with.  It's a hard life in more ways than one.	2001-04-29

It would seem, ever since the 60's and Dr. Leary et. al., that the existence of hard-wired neural circuitry attuned to the experiential spectrum otherwise known as 'god' is a given.  Yet, the kind of exhaustive documenting of such faculties as is done in this book is all part of the necessary belaboring of the obvious required to establish the phenomena as fact.  Whether or not one posits any 'new physics' such as 'God' or not.  Which, after all, is perennially left to the student as an excercise, as it should be, I suppose.  Personally, I could have wished for more discussion on the universality of the religious induction of 'metanoia' (that most interesting NT word historically mis-translated as 'repent'), and the endocrine (chakra) physiology changes associated with metanoia, as well as the contact-induced experiences (shaktipat). Not to mention a clearer rationale for the evolutionary survival advantages of metanoia in synchronicity modulation.  And the similarities to various other modes of consciousness such as schizophrenia and autism.  But for all of that, there are numerous complementary books such as those by Gopi Krishna and Victor Mansfield. It still seems that the puzzle of religion, even at this late date, requires a minimum of 10 or so disparate books such as this in order to be put together.  Yet, this has got to be one of the more important in the genre, in spite of such philosophically confusing assertions as the following: &quot;the neurological aspects of spiritual experience support the sense of the realness of God.&quot;    Esse est Percipi?	2001-04-29

I had not even realized such a biographical document in Dogen's own hand existed!  So many touching details of the master/student spiritual relationship are revealed here; both stories that are timeless in their humanity, as well as stories that reveal the unique character of the Zen culture of 13th century China.  Though, the famous story of 'body-mind drop-off' is not recounted by Dogen himself, as I was surprised to learn, other revealing anecdotes are - such as Dogen involuntarily weeping whenever he sees his teacher, and the teacher himself commenting on the auspiciousness of that sign.  It is a true love story, in a way.	2001-04-20

The mere fact alone that there exists a substance, 50 micrograms of which, would be sufficient to perhaps  reorient your entire life and understanding of the universe, whether or not one ever actually tries it, is well worth remembering on those occasions when we get a little too  self-preoccupied. This book documents the history of  the reactions of various individuals as they encountered this substance through an amazingly varied set of contexts, and through an intricately woven web of connections.  I have a mild annoyance with the book in that the author is  relentless in his effort to remain 'above it all' and regards everything with an amused and detached air.  It is a puzzling attitude in a way.  But the stories he tells are all well-crafted and make compelling reading.  His lack of reflection on the ultimate meaning of LSD for our view of what it is to be 'normal' may be quite intentional, but it seems to give the book an unnecessarily superficial  orientation which I found a bit strange.	2001-03-02

Which is a valuable rephrasing of the scientist's credo, all-too-often glossed over in science education.  In my opinion, the fatal flaw of this book  is Sagan's naive materialism.  Surprising to me, since  he was a life-long marijuana connoisseur, valuing it for giving him creative insights into scientific problems. Yet he appears to have gained no inkling of the transcendent possibilities of consciousness, and seems all-too-ready to fall into the old 19th century trap of dismissing it all as  wish-fulfillment fantasy (which, granted, 99% of it is).   Anyway, for a valuable antidote and/or complement to Sagan's somewhat antique formulation  of the scientific worldview, check out Nobelist Kary Mullis' 'Dancing Naked in the Mind Field', and physics prof. Victor Mansfield's 'Science Synchronicity and Soul Making'. Both of these books provide excellent counter-arguments to Sagan's (at times) all-too-naive skeptical realism, from  authors who are at least as scientifically qualified as Sagan, if not more so.	2001-01-31

In that respect, he finds an  honored place in the history of philosophers and seekers.  That he died in the process of his quest, was just an accident, and not really his fault at all.  I, for one, also enjoyed Jon Krakauer's own stories and interjections.  He has crafted a truly gripping tale.

THIS is the book that should be banned in high schools!<br />Needless to say, I have read it 3 times since I was 13,  and plan to read it again soon, and have left instructions for a copy to be cremated with me when i am finally  disposed of, after my trivial and inconsequential life is at last over, having gone on much too long, like a bad novel.<br />&quot;Greetings&quot;.  <br />please allow me to now disassemble myself, thank you.	2000-10-05

Lots of 60's spiritual history comes alive here. Good, bad and weird.  It reads easily, as if it was dictated orally in a 'rap' mode, and then carefully edited and assembled by someone else. <br />The most interesting anecdote for me, was the  account of the cremation ground practitioner. This is truly a valuable first-hand account,  at least for the record of religious anthropology.<br />Some flaky spiritual 'teachings' get mixed in  too, of course, which arent necessarily worth believing, such as:<br />&quot;The point I'm getting to is that it takes one            hundred thousand prostrations to get one good one.&quot;	2000-09-22

Excellent brief history of the person of Siddhartha Buddha, summarizing  much disconnected information found in the Pali Canon, and organizing it  into a chronology of his life, and the founding of the Buddhist Order.  Many extremely interesting maps and pictures also.  A valuable reference,  should be a required text in any Buddhism 101 college course! My one  quibble with this work is the presentation of the Buddha's Awakening in a  somewhat overly rationalistic  and reductive manner, which may appeal to  some 'scientific' types, but will certainly disappoint the Mahayana  Mystics, as well as even many Theravadans, I believe.  But religious  'soteriology' is not the focus of this book, after all.	2000-09-18

After all, as Kornfield shows  so well, it is only what *used* to be known in the West as 'Conversion'.   We of course know only too well the fickle nature of Christian experiences  of metanoia/conversion, but presumed incorrectly, as Kornfield shows, that  'Enlightened' Buddhists  are somehow different, i.e. 'more' enlightened.   But Kornfield shows they are in the same boat, spiritually speaking.  Its  about time we realized that Buddhist so-called 'Enlightenment Experiences'  are just as frequently realized by Christians, though described with  different terminology.   Perhaps now, we in the west can begin to  reappreciate the Enlightened Christian, Jewish teachers who have been with  us  in the West all along, patiently waiting for the faddish and fickle  public to wake up to the reality of Christian and Jewish spirituality,  and  stop assuming that, for example, commercial Christian  televangelism,  is   at all representative of Christianity as a spiritual path. A conclusion all  too easily drawn, sadly.	2000-09-01

What seems to bug this other 'Me' about the book, is the tacit assumption that such superpositions  are *never* experienced in the 'classical' world.  Well, jeez, what else is  schizophrenia all about, eh?  And if you read some of the old Zen Master  anecdotes, they are clearly talking about living in a world of  superposition, where 'to go one mile east, is to go one mile west'.  What  we need is for Thomas Cleary to have a go at doing a syncretic synthesis of  Zen and Physics.  It's about time for a newer 'Tao of Physics' it seems to  me!	2000-04-08

Amazingly, to me, Gopi Krishna found so little spiritual help and guidance in India, when there  were many avatars contemporary with him, like Meher Baba and Ramana  Maharshi.  Yet, it is instructive how hard it was for him to find  information and help, even in India, where this sort of transformational  experience is explicitly cultivated by literally millions!  One hopes that  his 12 years of agony and torture are not the norm for those who awaken the  Kundalini too forcefully or prematurely.  Yet, Nietzsche's own breakdown  after his own Kundalini awakening offers further caution to the forceful  awakening of Kundalini.  Clearly, some kind of yogic physical practice is  essential to moderate this transformation, like Chi Gung or Hatha Yoga, or  even Gardening!	2000-04-08

The story of Pauli and Jung is as fascinating as that of Bohr and Einstein, it seems to me, and deserves a book and a movie all its own!  One omission  in this book, is the connection between the 'kundalini' experience and  synchronicity, as the former is well known to stimulate the latter, giving  rise to a common phenomenon known as 'synchronicity storms'.  Another  omission is discussion of the schizophrenic experience of living in a  totally synchronistic universe, which the book 'Madness and Modernism' by  Sass describes quite well.  As Dr. Peat says, Synchronicity is a key  'anomaly' in the worldview of science these days, and as much as critics  like Victor Stegner would like to pooh-pooh it as totally subjective,  (which merely begs the question of the locus of 'meaning' after all), it  does seem to point to the 'bridge between matter and mind'. Science has far  too rigidly adhered to Newton's adamant 'Hypotheses Non Fingo' in banishing  all discussion of 'meaning' from physics.  i.e. the 'meaningless universe'  of Stephen Weinberg et. al. is merely an artifact of an ad-hoc methodology,  not an inherent attribute of Nature. 'Meaning' is where it's at, after all!  And why *should* it be purely 'objective'?	2000-04-08

This is a great example of the cognitive dissonance going on in physics these days.  Theories so bizarre, as to make Black Holes seem commonplace, yet with NO supposed implications for  Newtonian mechanistic meaningless worldviews.  When Einstein said 'Relativity Changed Everything Except How  We Think', one could imagine Einstein included himself in that criticism  merely out of politeness, yet with Deutsch it seems actually true.  Though,  I still have hope that Deutsch will break his rigid academic strait-jacket,  perhaps after the Nobel, and perhaps via some vibes from colleague Brian  Josephson, and get a little into the 'what does it all mean' vein ...  like  whoever said: &quot;Sahasarara Popping Transcendence&quot;, hehehe.

This book reminds us that such a spirit of inquiry has been pursued for thousands of years, and occasionally resulted in transformative experiences of metanoia such as recounted by astronaut Edgar Mitchell.  Experiences like this are the antidote for the nihilistic despair of modern materialistic society where wealth is virtue and poverty is a crime.  Deep study of the measurement paradox in quantum theory or the chaos of thoughts in meditation can equally evoke such metanoia to realize Reality.<br /><br />Granted, the 'Bootstrap' theory described in the book is passe, and so critics often allege so is the thesis of the book. Yet, it seems to me, many parallels have strengthened in the intervening years, such as the notion of bidirectional  time, and the multiverse solution to EPR.  As well as the appreciation that seen from the framework of the 'standard model' of physics, consciousness is an anomaly, that is assumed to be an epiphenomenon without much justification, as 50 years of fruitless AI research can testify to.  If consciousness were indeed primary as Planck asserted, why not then allow for the possibility that the ancient meditators actually discovered something fundamental about it, such as its non-locality and similarity to light?  After all, what else is the religious symbolism of the halo meant to convey?<br /><br />It seems to me, the common  denominator of mysticism is access to an orthogonal dimension of 'time'  from the point of view of which, our linear time is 'stationary'.  At any  rate, it seems to me that prof. Victor Mansfield's 'Science Synchronicity  and Soul Making' is the best update to Capra's thesis.  Also Ken Wilber's 'QuantumQuestions' is a good sourcebook complement, as another reviewer mentioned,  though Wilber seems to have some professional jealousy towards Capra.  Schrodinger's own 'My View of the World' is also important.  Even though  Schrodinger  himself dismisses the attempts to 'prove' mysticism via  physics, it is clear his mystical view of the world derived from his early study of Vedanta finds no contradiction in his view of physics.  It surely must be an embarassment to many modern scientists that so many of the founders of the most fundamental of sciences, quantum physics, were such staunch mystical anti-materialists.	2000-04-08

A 'suggestion for  further  research': follow up with a book on  biochemistry of LSD and consciousness,  interview Albert Hoffman and John Lilly maybe.  As one of the 'Big  Important Discoveries  Swept Under the Carpet', it seems to me, is that 1  milligram of a substance  can make a lifetime's worth of intellectual  opinions, motivations, and ambitions  suddenly 'irrelevant'. (pg 164) but,  of course,  what better reason for sweeping this under the carpet?	2000-03-26

Though, clearly, kundalini  manifestations are important and essential to many  religions and saints -  this account shows the dangers of 'using' it intentionally.<br />The leader  gains in charisma with the awakening of his own kundalini, and their  followers pick up on the energy, and seek out direct contact with it.  The  leader then gets into the trap of unconsciously manipulating the followers  by the doleing out or withholding of these energy 'treatments' - the leader  becomes a pusher with a drug that the followers crave.<br />Shainberg's book  describes this kind of dynamic clearly, though it did not sink too far into  actual abuse, it clearly was a tool of manipulation and creating dependence  on the teacher, and a means for the teacher to financially profit.<br />Other  examples that spring to mind, are Jim Jones - his Pentecostal experience  gave him some access to the kundalini energy.  The  Aum Shin ry Kyo (sp)  cult in Japan, was clearly driven by dependence on the leader's kundalini  transmissions.  David Koresh perhaps owed his charisma to kundalini type  'energy' (aka 'Holy Spirit' in Christian parlance). Hare Krishnas are a  little puzzling, as their dependence was largely due to the ecstasy of the  kirtan experience, as far as i can see, rather than the direct kundalini  manipulation of the founding Swami.  <br />anyway, Shainberg gives us a real  case study of the pre-cult  stages of manipulation and dependence, I think.	2000-03-26
