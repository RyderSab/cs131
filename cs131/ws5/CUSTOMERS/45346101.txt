My fears of this being a book too bogged by history/biography were quickly tossed aside...Emma's War is so engaging because it is actually three stories in one: the story of an English woman who married a Sudanese rebel, the contentious history of southern Sudan, and a very delightful first-person narrative about the author herself and her experiences with the first two. <br /> <br />What I like so much about this book is that it never takes sides; Scroggins is somewhat sympathetic towards Emma, but never apologetic over her (sometimes) inhumane actions. This book also really illuminates the situation in Darfur now, and how the conflict of the last 20 years has fueled the current crisis there. I'd call it a must-read for anyone interested in the region, and anyone struggling to understand the conflicts of interest between humanitarian aid and armed conflict.	2004-12-21

Buy what they won't know is the rich and diverse history of this land, and the fact that while the Khan family may have been presented accurately, their experience is not necessarily reflective of an entire population. <br /> <br />I found my position as a resident of Kabul to definitely impact how I read this book. I was often frustrated at how the author didn't always contextualize the history of the place and people she was writing about, and I did not think the book was very literary in its style (though, as one reviewer noted, this could be a translator's fault). For people who want a more varied (and accurate) view of Afghanistan, I'd suggest picking up Christina Lamb's The Sewing Circles of Herat instead.	2004-08-10

No one died young, no one tortured the young girl, and she wasn't raised in some exotic location. On the contrary, Haven's childhood was probably like a lot of people's...without major drama but full of interesting people and little stories that make for a wholesome read. I found this book very easy to get into and finish, and exceptionally refreshing compared to the majority of memoirs these days that focus on the negative. I guarantee readers of Zippy will come away with a deep appreciation for Haven's parents for raising her in a happy, and healthy environment that produced a great writer to boot.	2004-07-20

As a fan of Jonathon Kozol's early books about the American education system, Death at an Early Age, and the landmark Savage Inequalities, I looked forward to reading this book which showed the flip side of public schools--a high achieving school whose students were &quot;making it.&quot; Anecdotally, the book holds up, with interesting tales of young artists whose parents thwart their talents, a kid tangled in crystal meth, etc. But like another reviewer has stated, an underlying message seems to be wanting.<br />For example, Humes states at one point that the school is very diverse, but with roughly 80% of the student body being Asian, and no black students being mentioned in the stories, it's really hard to get a sense of what that so-called diversity means. And then there's the issue of the introduction of technology into Whitney as a gift from Neil Bush's corporate campaign. Humes could have been explicit in asking why a student body with the highest test scores in the nation is more deserving of computers in the classroom than those kids who could use a leg up, but he doesn't. What would have made this book more powerful is to have seen the other side--those kids who didn't get to go to Whitney, and how their lives were or were not impacted by that decision.<br />Still, it's an interesting look at how teachers have adapted to changing times, and with some worthy lesson plans, makes for a decent read.	2003-09-29

This arresting memoir documents, unflinchingly, a childhood of brutality and hope. It does so in an unapologetic manner. Kluger does not want sympathy; she merely wants to be able to tell her personal history and a different point of view. Many of her anecdotes are downright controversial, a plus for book club discussions. For example, she challenges the notion that Nazi women were as cruel as their male counterparts, and she questions whether the bond between she and her mother would have survived if forced to choose between their lives. My only reservation is it gets off to a slow start, but Still Alive is brilliant in the end.	2003-08-30

But what ruins the story is, quite simply, the writing. Characters--such as Alice's violent boyfriend--surface once, have their dramatic moment, and then never return again. This seems to be a trend in the execution of this book. Sedgwick frequently introduces interesting and dramatic elements, but then leaves them hanging in space and takes the \\"easy\\" way out. Thus, the book ends in mid-air, with a lot of loose ends, and not much substance beyond everyday pop psychology. Best to leave this book behind and instead pick up a psycho-thriller like \\"In the Cut\\".	2003-08-04

Look no more! Marjane Satrapi's book about growing up during the Iranian revolution is engaging, witty, well drawn and something you'll finish in one sitting. Ms. Satrapi finds the common thread of everyone's childhood (her recollection of wanting to grow up to be a prophet is hilarious) but also expresses her unique voice and identity as the daughter of liberal Iranians whose views ended up being thwarted by the new regime that was ushered in following the 1979 revolution. Even if you don't have an interest in Iranian history/politics, I guarantee you'll love this book!	2003-05-30

As our nameless narrator moves through the prison toward the eventual cell of the Unbreakables (the point of no return), his memories--lost to him at the onset of the novel--slowly come back, and as the walls get darker, so too does the story of his life. Moshiri deftly captures the terrifying feelings that accompany torture, and the remnants of hope that sustain the bleak lives of those trapped in Hall 20, cell 4. I kept trying to guess the ending of this book as I read, but it was impossible, and yet it ends exactly as it should, and that's the beauty of this work.	2003-03-04

What's even better is that she does it without ever being sentimental.<br />While I liked all of the essays in this volume, my favorites were ones that showed lives of the &quot;average&quot; American, like Heather Heaton, a young journalist covering the events of a small town, and, of course, &quot;The American Male, age 10.&quot; Ms. Orlean has a way of following her subjects around &amp; illuminating their lives, without ever getting in the way.

This book is an incredible contribution to the study of human personality and behavior--but what shocks me most is how long it took anyone to say express these ideas! Rufus explores the common stereotypes of loners as misfits, criminals, and perverts, and debunks them by showing the valuable contributions loners have made to the creative arts, science, and technology. She challenges the assumption that it takes two to make a life event meaningful, and brings hope to those of us who may feel alone in our loner status. An important and enjoyable read for everyone, whether you consider yourself a loner or not!	2003-01-08

Set in the brewing years of the Iranian revolution, it follows two people's lives, Mahastee and Reza, friends as children, who have now been inextricably tied in to the politics of their land. Warning to all who may have a mistaken view of where this is going: this novel is definitely not a love story! It is much more about the history of a place, and its people, about how much we can and cannot control our own destinies. <br />Reading this novel you can almost feel the wind rush off the Alborz mountains, feel the sense of impending doom that is about to crash down on these characters and their countryside. While it takes a few chapters to get truly involved in their story, you'll find it hard to put down once you are. And believe me, it's worth it...this book as the most heartbreakingly realistic ending I have ever read.	2002-10-14

Moreover, this book suffers from having a non-native author. As someone else mentioned, there are quite a few grammatical errors, or usage of the wrong, or lesser used preposition.<br />The books merits, though, are the careful explanation of how to make the Persian letters. It is also somewhat useful if you have learned Farsi in the classroom, and need some backup as to certain rules (such as how to form plurals). But for the beginner, I'd recommend the Lonely Planet guidebook as a more comprehensive and easier introduction.	2002-10-08

Not so with this masterpiece by Firouz. Don't be fooled by some of the editorial reviews and book jacket comments...this is not a romance. It's more a story of exile, of what happens when a country's politics end up shutting out an entire generation of people. And that's the book's power and beauty. <br />Mahastee and Reza are both smart enough to recognize that ultimately they have chosen their fates, and to realize that whatever they might do, by virtue of social class, revolutionary association, etc., their fates are now out of their hands. It's what makes this book profound and tragic, and ultimately, the most realistic book you'll ever read about 1979 Iran.	2002-10-08

If you are interested in understanding the inner workings of the mind of someone who is living in a war-ravaged society, then this book is excellent. But if you are reading it to understand more about Lebanon's bloody history and civil war, you won't find much here...it's really focused on the thought processes of its protagonist, Asmahan, and if you don't bring to the book existing knowledge of the place or the conflict, you won't learn anything. Therefore, I'd really recommend it only to those who know the backdrop of Lebanon's civil war.	2002-09-19

Though some of them are a bit dated (especially for younger readers who may not have directly witnessed the unfolding of the 60s), they do represent a wide cross-section of the best and worst of our society. &quot;Slouching Towards Bethelem,&quot; the title essay, is written with such a deadpan manner it's hard not to laugh at loud at some points (Example: when a strung out kid asks Didion her age and she replies &quot;32&quot;, he pauses then reflects, &quot;Don't worry...there's old hippies, too.&quot;) But Didion is more than a casual observer of events...she really delves into the history of California and its people, so this is less a &quot;light&quot; read, but enjoyable and educational nonetheless.	2002-08-27

That being said, the latter third of the novel loses much of the beauty of language and setting that Nahai evokes in the first 150 pages. It's as if she ran out of description and instead tries to hasten the narrative. The result is a book that's interesting, but perhaps not quite satisfying in the end. Still, I'd recommend it if only for the wonderful description of Blue's homeland, though I'd say if you want the best Nahai novel, try Moonlight on the Avenue of Faith.	2002-08-20

I recognize that Ellis may be sparing some readers unnecessary horror, but there are certainly places--such as the marketplace where Parvana goes to sell her wares--where Ellis could have infused much richer detail in the sights, sounds, and experiences of the average Afghan. I also think it would have been better to define the unknown terms (chador, nan) and elements of history within the narrative itself, rather than wait until the end of the book, since most young Americans will be unfamiliar with these terms, and the whole notion of Soviet occupation. Still, I am happy to see children's literature about this region springing up, and hope that this book encourages other writers to tell these stories.	2002-08-17

I bought this as an &quot;airplane read&quot; but couldn't put it down. Geraldine Brooks has done us a great favor by not only illuminating the process of finding one's long lost penpals, but also by educating many folks about Australia in the process. It's fascinating to see her perceptions of the world, and particularly America, based on the letters that come in her mailbox each month. <br />While I read this one on my own, I have since leant this book to several friends and we've engaged in some interesting discussions about our own penpal experiences, so I recommend it for book clubs.	2002-08-13

Ms. Ebtekar takes us inside the embassy compound in a fascinating account of the early days of this culminating moment in the revolution, and it's a view we as Americans need to at least check out.  My own complaints with the book was that it seemed to lose some of the narrative thread as the description of the crisis wore on, and I would have also liked a bit more reflection on the part of the author given her current position in the Iranian government. Nevertheless, an important read for Americans and Iranians alike.	2002-07-12

Aaron's own mixed background emerge through these poems, as does his feeling (which we all can relate to) of being a stranger in the world, the one soul for whom the &quot;Last Seat on the Bus&quot; is reserved. <br />Rudolph's own influences--Valerie Martinez and Martin Espada--come through in this work, but he goes beyond them to create a language and feeling of his own.

And while I was not tremendously drawn in by the blurb on the back cover, reading the first two pages proved my first impressions wrong. This book is a phenomenal example of modern magical realism found in a society that one would normally not associate with that genre. But moreover, it really brings to light the plight of two groups of people: Iranian jews confined to the ghettos in their own country, and Iranian exiles forced to begin a new life in the United States. Nahai is able to expertly weave the history of her homeland with the fantastic, but does so in a way that is both easy and enjoyable to read.	2002-06-21
