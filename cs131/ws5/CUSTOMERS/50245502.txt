I put off reading anything by Nick Hornby for years and finally I picked up this book at a discounted price and didn't put it down until I reached the last page. It's that good! Humorous, smart and so true. Hornby takes a brutal look at the average unsuccessful Joe with a dream that got sidelined by a desire to grow-up but in fact never did. All through this journey of self-exploration, we find characters that are funny, poignant and sad, trying to realise their dreams, not matter how insignificant they are in the context of our larger material world, in their own distinctly individual ways, be it reviving a career as a disc jockey, singing in a band or simply falling in love. It's such an easy and satisfying read, it's an afternoon well spent.	2001-10-22

By combining his consummate skills in espionage story-telling (in which he is second to none) and the knife-and-dagger world of the pharmaceutical industry, Le Carre has weaved a web of deceit, greed and longing that only he could pull off. It's still not his best work but it definitely surpasses THE TAILOR OF PANAMA and SINGLE &amp; SINGLE.	2001-10-22

After having read Michael Cunningham's 2 masterpieces The Hours and Home at the End of the World, this long and rambling tale is a bit of a surprise and a let down. It's alternative title could be &quot;Anything that can go wrong in an Upper-middle class family in America&quot;. All the elements of a made-for-TV movie are there - immigrant made good, marriage, adultery, divorce, sex, betrayal, drugs, a gay son, a cross-dresser with a heart of gold, homophobic father, tragedy, death, AIDS, coming to terms....Thankfully, Cunningham saves this tome from the grasp of mediocrity by avoiding the broad strokes that lesser writers would use on the characters. Also evident is his mastery of the language. The poetry is still there but Cunningham's talent and ambitions are better served outside the terrain of pulp fiction.	2001-08-11

Notwithstanding the linguistic pyrotechnics that Matthew Stadler employs to lift this book towards a higher literary plane, &quot;Allan Stein&quot; is nothing more than a lame account of teenage fixation bordering on paedophilia. Besides the narrator and the subject of his obsession, the hotch-potch group of supporting characters - the real Herbert Widener, the boys' parents, the French curator, the Danish tenant, the strange but wealthy Englishman - are entirely incidental. Even the young boy who stole his heart is a puzzlement. His cold facade is unfathomable right up to the final pages. The historical accounts of Allan Stein, while providing a backdrop for the narrator's trip to Paris, is itself a sad excuse for the novel and adds little of consequence to the heart of the story. The entire tale would be better off as a short story but I was kept turning and turning the pages (hence, the book succeeded to that extent) to get to the point of it all which, alas, is still a mystery to me. The finale, if you call it that, was hurried and unsatisfying; a climax that never came. For a much more intelligent and less deceiving account of the same theme, read Alan Hollinghurst's &quot;The Folding Star&quot;.	2001-07-16

I was not impressed by the initial chapters of the book but, like its theme, my patience was rewarded in spades. Ha Jin's writing is simple and schoolboyish at times, not what I would expect from a prize-winning effort. However, it is quite apt for this tale of simple unambitious characters from the heartlands of China caught in the thick of the country's evolution into capitalism. It is to Ha Jin's credit that the waiting is as frustrating for the reader as it is for Manna. The beauty of the novel lies in the underlying themes of the rapid changes in China and how it eventually drives home to even a most loyal follower like Lin Kong. The final chapters where Lin Kong finally realises how he lost 17-years of his life trying to marry the woman he thought he loved and missed the growing years of his daughter, completely blind to the devotion of his duty-bound wife, is simply heartbreaking. This book is a little gem that's worth the wait.	2001-07-11

Seamus Deane has brilliantly crafted a powerful account of the Northern Irish struggle in a most unique way. Narrated by a growing boy, each short chapter is a little vignette of his life and yet strung together effortlessly like a web to create a moving tale imbued with sadness, love, humour and mystery. The early chapters appear to lack form and direction but with a little patience, the reader will be richly rewarded. As the child grows up, he learns (and so does the reader) more of the grim realities of life in Northern Ireland, the tragedies that befall his family (past and present) and the secret of betrayal that threatens the bond between him and his parents. It's a testament to Deane's talent that the book reads easily, yet some scenes - a hike up the hills or a touch of the father's hand - can be so beautifully rendered and moving. Get past the early chapters and you won't be disapponited.	2001-01-09

What can I add to all the accolades heaped on Michael Cunningham that isn't already said? Except to affirm that this book worked its magic on me in surprising ways and makes me believe that, in spite of all the pulp that calls itself &quot;literature&quot; in these days of mass market paperbacks...., it is still possible to a produce a book of remarkable quality such as this one. I haven't read any of Virginia Woolf's works and the subject matter of this book is not exactly the most accessible. Yet Cunningham has put together a novel that cleverly weaves the past with the present, fiction with fact, in language that is so singularly eloquent it is hard to imagine how anyone can improve on this work of art. What surprised me most is that, although neither a mystery nor a thriller, &quot;The Hours&quot; kept me turning the pages and I can attribute that only to Cunningham's consummate skills. This is one book I'll gladly re-read.	2000-11-29

Despite the critical acclaim and Booker Prize nomination, this book is an uninspired attempt to contrast the social ills of two very different societies. The theme is perhaps noble and difficult, but Desai fails to pull it off. Neither of the main characters, the siblings Uma and Arun, are protrayed in more than one dimension and are hardly worth caring for. One learns less about them than how they are perceived by others. The events that pepper Uma's life in India are nothing more than disjointed vignettes, and Arun's little window into a dysfunctional suburban American family left an empty feeling. Desai deserves credit for her skills in human and social observation but the entire novel is only that and never once engages the reader's heart and mind in the story-telling. Finally, the writing style in the two parts of the novel is so contrasting that I wondered if they were written by two different authors.	2000-10-26

McEwan has written yet another engrossing book that is also a minor  literary triumph. The premise is simple: a single glance at a stranger  turns into a nightmare for Joe Rose as he becomes the subject of the  former's obsession. While the stalker wreaks havoc for Joe's life and his  marriage, the tables are turned when Joe unconsciously becomes obssessed by  the stalker's psychological condition. Along the way, the book raises many  questions about trust and forgiveness in a relationship and the  conditionality of life's cruel path. McEwan is most impressive in his  ability to set-up a scene in the most deliberate yet unpredictable style  which, in my opinion, is unsurpassed and keeps the pages turning. The  famous first chapter is a brilliant example. So is the murder attempt in  the restaurant that literally left me gasping. There are some gripes - the  book's pacing is somewhat uneven and the psychological ramblings can be  trying at times but McEwan seldom loses focus. It is not as taut and  gripping as his earlier masterpiece &quot;The Innocent&quot; but it is  indeed a fine example of McEwan's stylish brilliance.	2000-08-29

This line  from the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; aptly describes how Ian McEwan  masterfully peels away the secrets and mysteries of this tale ever so  slowly page after page. In very lucid and undemanding prose, McEwan manages  to build the suspense intelligently until the very last chapter. The first  half of the book sets the stage with characters that are never beyond  reproach or suspicion, yet as the tale unfolds in a most engaging fashion,  it gives no hint of the grisly human drama that follows. It is essentially  a story of love and the loss of innocence for which Leonard Marnham, the  book's central character, paid dearly. Elements of espionage, suspense,  drama and romance are mixed in a brew that is remarkably refreshing and  clever, like nothing I've ever read before. The scenes in which Leonard  tries to dispose of the incriminating evidence are crafty and very funny. A  surprisingly brilliant novel and, in my opinion, better than his  Booker-prize winner.	2000-08-19

One can't help but be amazed by the subtlety with which Ishiguro has  tackled a tale about Japan post-World War II. In various sub-themes, he  tells of how residents of Nagasaki deal with the aftermath of the war in  their own, yet different ways. A widow who'd lost almost her entire family  rebuilds her life by running a humble noodle shop and putting all her hopes  and optimism on her only surviving son. The retired father-in-law of the  central character (Etsuko) deals with the widening rift between him and his  son, and a past that has lost its relevance in modern day Japan. The  central tale is one of loss and regret as Etsuko grapples with the suicide  of her eldest daughter and the futility of her lonely life in England.  <br />All these subjects are told in Ishiguro's very delicate and sensitive  rendering that can only be achieved by one who's a master of his craft.  Although one could complain about an excessive use of subtlety, all the  more does one appreciate Ishiguro's achievement of producing a work of art  that does not at once suggest what the reader should make of it. I am sure  re-reading the book would unveil more surprising nuances and advance the  pleasure of this remarkable work of fiction. He is one of my favourite  authors and although, in my opinion, &quot;The Artist of the Floating  World&quot; remains his best book, this comes closest to it than his more  popular Remains of the Day.	2000-08-14

Rohintry Mistry has written a cleverly imagined novel set in turbulent India of the 1970s and brimming with unforgettable characters whose daily battle against the travails of life honour the toughness of the human  spirit. Depressing is one word to describe this long journey as the four  main characters - a hard-headed divorcee struggling for her independence,  two tailors from the &quot;untouchable&quot; caste seeking a better life in  the big city and a young middle-class student uprooted from a close-knit  family - overcome one hurdle after another only to face a higher one. They  eventually come one full circle to meet their cruel, yet, inevitable fates  that they had struggled a lifetime to avoid. The irony is perhaps the  central theme of this book that is written in lucid prose that keeps the  reader glued as events unfold. The book's length may appear daunting but  perseverence will be richly rewarded. A literary triumph indeed!	2000-07-27

The fact that she survived all the  persecution by her family (her own &quot;bones and flesh&quot;) is  remarkable. One also gets a glimpse into the moneyed world of the immigrant  Chinese and the machinations of the evil hand of wealth. Her writing in  crisp and clear, making the book extremely readable. The chapter titles of  Chinese idioms are most apt. However, there are flaws and the main failing  is the lack of depth and exploration into the characters. The book is  merely one person's biased point of view. It would be far more enriching to  delve a little more into the book's cast, especially the siblings who  played critical roles in Adeline's adult life. Her lucid writing style  veers towards a history book, hence rather short on character and mood.  Nevertheless, the book succeeds rather well as a straight-forward account  of a daughter's plight for recognition and love.	2000-06-19

Once in a while, a book takes you so deep into another place or culture filled with memorable characters and brought to life in vivid detail that it is almost impossible to put down. &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is  certainly one such novel. This is a mesmerising tale, written in simple,  direct and elegant prose that hardly puts any strain on one's imagination  except to savour the wonderful recreation of a dying Japanese sub-culture.  Perhaps the simplicity and the feel-good conclusion are its only failings,  but these are minor glitches that should not detract from the Arthur  Golden's engaging story and his ability to completely submerge the reader  into the amazing world of the geisha to such extent that one wonders where  the line between fact and fiction is drawn.	2000-06-14

One can't deny the extreme originality of Paul Auster's stories. In each of them, he ostensibly challenges the blurred definition of reality and the boundary between that and what the mind tells us. The irrational quality  that permeates &quot;City of Glass&quot; defies all comprehension. I found  this story the toughest to get through. Not by its complexity but by the  monotony that eventually sets in the second half and by the ambiguous  ending. Quinn is by far one the most mind-boggling and ridiculous  characters in contemporary fiction. Likewise, the characters in  &quot;Ghosts&quot; are incredulous but it is redeemed by the interesting  premise of the watcher being watched and how the tables are eventually  turned. The most accessible is the final tale &quot;The Locked Room&quot;.  The writer is constantly haunted by the memory of his best friend whose  life he has inadvertantly taken over and is finally driven to discover the  truth in a painful journey into the friend's past. Besides the depth of  characterisation, it also cleverly incorporates the themes in the other  stories (both expressed and implied).	2000-06-12

Leavitt returns to familiar territory in two of the novellas with themes of friendship, unrequited love, AIDS and hope. The writer in &quot;Saturn Street&quot; falls in love with an AIDS patient and is faced with inner  turmoils that he can hardly put his finger on. Leavitt's amazingly light  and sensitive touch avoids the melodrama that lesser writers would succumb  to. &quot;The Wooden Anniversary&quot; raises more questions than it  answers and the ending clearly demands a sequel. This lastest instalment of  the Celia and Nathan Show deserves a deeper exploration into the psyche of  the two main characters. Thankfully, it does contain some intelligent  vignettes of the evolving and unspoken tension of old friendships that  makes it worth the effort. Lastly, in &quot;The Term-Paper Artist&quot;,  Leavitt shows a different side of him: funny, crafty and even charming.  Entertaining enough but hardly engaging. Leavitt is an eloquent and  amazingly sharp writer of gay fiction and many of his earlier works have  moved me a great deal.

The book is essentially a series  of sub-plots that aren't sufficiently developed and the abrupt ending can  only be described as a plunge into inconsequence and emptiness. Leavitt has  been sharper and more elegant in his early novels and short stories.

The  tragic but inevitable conclusion tugged at my heart like few other novels.

What's more  impressive is his doing so in very spare and lucid prose that often cuts  right into the difficult issues. Yet, I had to read and re-read many  passages, notably the dialogue between David Lurie and his daughter Lucy,  to appreciate the characters and the multiple interpretations that the  novel suggests. But for the same reason, the writing comes off rather cold  and distant, and there's nothing in the ending to suggest any hope for  David Lurie or the South African people at large. I also have one question:  why does Lucy keep the baby and accept Petrus' protection instead of moving  away? Does she do this just to spite her father? Or is it an expression of  her independence as a child and as a woman? Notwithstanding, the book  succeeds as an intelligent allegory of the South African struggle to come  to terms with its history and is more deserving of the Booker Prize than  the previous winner &quot;Amsterdam&quot; by Ian McEwan.	2000-06-08

These are difficult themes and in the brilliant hands of  Mr Greene, we have an intelligent and sensitive novel that is beautifully  written. Greene creates a small cast of characters who are trapped in their  own desires - Bendrix's love for Sarah, a source of joy and hurt, hope and  disappointment, and ultimately despair ; her search for rationality in the  consequences of her own faith and the sad fate that has befallen her; and  Henry's ideal of a solid marriage as a foundation of his ambitious career,  a love perhaps but one devoid of passion and sharing. As always, Greene  writes with economy of description - succint and precise yet almost perfect  in conveying every scene, thought and feeling. The novel provides no  answers nor does it contain any obvious message but the intelligent  treatment of the various subjects and the wonderful writing makes this  another literary gem by one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.	2000-05-30

Thankfully, Amy Tan's  first-rate storytelling skills has produced a mesmerising book that  successfully combines myths and legends with the underlying contemporary  tale of the power of love.<br />The reminiscence of past lives, juxtaposed  with events and people in the present, might be difficult to follow in the  beginning but patience will pay off handsomely when everything begins to  gel like a delightful jigsaw puzzle. This is not a literary masterpiece  nor, I suspect, was it meant to be. While Amy Tan manages to weave an  engaging tale (and what a tale it is!), her command of the language lacks  the subtlety or the sizzle that could distinguish this novel. It is  essentially a page turner; pure escapism smoothly rendered and cleverly  packaged, in the backdrop of cultures and traditions, into a message of  hope (even in death), of promises kept and of the loyalty and love between  friends. At that level, this novel is thoroughly enjoyable.	2000-05-29

After the utter disappointment of The Tailor of Panama, Le Carre's latest novel harks back to his crafty old ways. His writing is superb, particularly in the treatment of the father-son relationship and he knows  the way around scenes of physical and psychological tension better than any  other author I know. The opening chapters are brilliant and his ability to  put together a seemingly complex puzzle is still in top form, albeit with  somewhat less shine than in his early masterpieces set during the Cold War.  However, this outing is deceptively timid by comparison. The plot, when  revealed, is simple and contains no surprises. We know who's the crook from  the start, don't we? The approach to the climax is indeed rushed and the  big bang one hopes for fails to materialise. Despite these flaws, it's  still a very good read and I'm glad to see Le Carre regaining some of the  lustre that made him, in my opinion, the best and classiest espionage  author of his generation.	2000-02-28

Cortlett writes with confidence on a difficult subject : an adult's reflection on young love lost in a gay context. The novel is filled with themes like the thrills and disappointment of first love, the affair that was doomed from the start, the aging homosexual who has harboured the pain  for 30 years, a closeted and insular life, social manners of the middle  class British family, etc. All these are handled with care and aplomb by  Cortlett without suggesting any foolproof answers. Some passages in the  &quot;Then&quot; sections come across as amateurish and naive but are  believeable if taken as expressions and thoughts of a immature 15 year-old  schoolboy. Cortlett is more successful in the &quot;Now&quot; chapters,  displaying a very sensitive touch in the relationship between the family  members and playing off the tensions extremely well. It's a heartbreaking  tale of love lost and a lifetime of sacrifices and compromises, ending with  a question: is it too late? Highly recommended to all readers.	2000-01-28
