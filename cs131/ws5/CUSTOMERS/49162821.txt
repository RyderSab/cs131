Great Greens solves these issues beautifully!<br />In Great Greens, we are presented a very thorough and detailed examination of both common and unknown greens.  First, we are given a great glossary of greens and their various ways of preparing them, along with a useful section recommending various tools that will facilitate the handling of them.<br />The book is divided into 10 sections that begin with the forward and introduction and then branch out into recipes for starters, soups, salads, main dishes, and side dishes.  What is extremely useful is the table equivalents.  The recipes offered are fast and surprisingly easy to do!<br />The information presented in this compact book, delivers in a huge way.  The photographs make greens look quite sensuous.	2004-03-17

I was very delighted to happen upon this book, which was originally written in 1924. The author, \\"A Member of the Aristocracy.\\" In its broadest sense it IS an etiquette book; but I feel it gives people an insiders view, if you will, of how aristocrats behave in society.<br />First, the word \\"Etiquette\\" is defined: \\" What is etiquette, and what does the word convey? It is a poor one itself, and falls very far short of its wide application. It has been so constantly misused and misinterpreted and misunderstood that ridicule and contempt have been most unjustly and unfairly thrown upon it.\\" The author gives first rate instruction about making introductions, paying calls, the order of precedence and how to behave at court. You are provided with tables of pronunciation of names, how to give dinners at home as well as dinning out. The chapter on dinner-table etiquette is timeless. Those of you who have had to suffer through a meal with people who use their utensils like weapons will understand where I am coming from. Wedding planning, country house visits, being invited to shoot are here also, leaving no doubt that an Englishman or woman wrote this.<br />Though many will not encounter social situations such as those described in depth in this book, it is still an excellent one to have. There is quite a lot of information that can, and should be used in this high-tech, increasingly rude world.	2002-06-09

Back in my days as an Art History major, I realized early on that you really DID need to know about the history and the culture that gave birth to the art of the Italian Renaissance. Often, after a lecture, I would race home to try and find out more about a particular painter or family that supported an artist. This book gave me PLENTY of much need information. I got to know who the major players were, had artistic terms clarified, and got neat biographical information about everyone from Clement VI to Palladio. This delightful book also covered music, diplomacy, the role of the church, and literature. It also has hundreds of illustrations. Of special note was the section concerning the status of women. With over 750 entries, it is perfect for the student and the scholar.	2002-01-23

I am hard pressed to recall a humor book that was so very well done, that academics routinely cite examples from its pages. The Official Preppy Handbook has achieved that.<br />Lisa Birnbach and company, successfully documented the lives of the Prep School set, from youth to retirement. Along the way they explore in a brilliant and witty way, the mindset and lifestyle of this group. You learn immediately that being a Preppy is well beyond going to a private school. Preps exude Noblesse Oblige, while wearing Lacoste polos and drinking Bloody Mary's. You learn about their cars, colleges, clothes, food, jobs, music, pets, what they read and how they decorate their houses. You learn what &quot;To Summer,&quot; REALLY means. You even learn their speech patterns, and prep vocabulary. Along the way you have a lot of laughs, while getting an education about what makes these people tick. Years later, I still pull out my pristine copy not only for laughs, but for reference as well.  In recent years others have tried to follow this groundbreaking formula only to have missed the mark. You will find many books with:  &quot;In the traditon of The Preppy Handbook&quot;  in their titles.  They do not even come close.<br />Sadly, this artifact is out of print. Perhaps someone will start a letter writing campaign to Workman Publishers, begging them to reprint it. It is REALLY that good!	2002-01-19

These institutions make my city what it is: The cultural capitol of the world. Many of these cultural palaces were founded by members of America's Secret Aristocracy. Author Steven Birmingham presents a VIVID portrait of this group and it's history.<br /> It is an elite group, whose roots go way back to the founding of this nation. It's members have married each other, fought in wars, endowed universities and cultural institutions, made policy decisions, held elected office, and in some of their less guarded moments, gotten themselves involved in scandals.<br /> We learn, and start to understand how American aristocrats think and what their values are. What we learn is that these people live by a code: Noblesse oblige. They are all about serving their country, community families and friends. They are about making a contribution to this nation.<br /> The Author spent several months conducting interviews with members of this elite group, from the east coast to the west coast, with stops in between. What he discovers and what we finally see, is the insiders view of the organizations &amp; secret societies that serve and support this group, as well as the strong and determined personalites that keep things rolling. We also get a rare behind the scenes history lesson. We learn more about John Jay, the Astors, the Randolphs of Virginia, the Browns of Newport and who the Boston Brahmins really are. Each story is truly fascinating.<br /> America's Secret Aristocracy is a real eye opener, and not just about a group of elites who have played mega roles for hundreds of years in this nation. It is a fuller history of this nation. It is a book that fills in many historical gaps, and that makes it well worth having!	2001-07-28

He examines how these families established themselves and built their tremendous wealth.  Many of the founding family members started out as soldiers, merchants, bankers and acting as advisors to Kings, Holy Roman Emperors and Popes.  In short, they made themselves indispensible to very powerful people.  They also made lucrative business deals, excellent marriages, had children, and continued to do so each generation.  There is, however, FAR more to them than that. They are SURVIVORS.  They have survived wars, political and social upheavel only to regroup and rebuild.  They inherit and pass on both their wealth, philosophy, and a way of life that has lasted for centuries.<br />  In interviewing the 6th Duke of Westminister, H.S.H. Hans-Adam of Liechtenstein, Marquis Dino Frescobaldi, The Duchess of Medinaceli, H.S.H. Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, and Jean Louis, Marquis de Ganay, we start to understand how aristocrats feel about their positions in the modern world and the reverence they have for their past.  We also find out what they see as their role for the future.<br />  Robert Lacey's style is highly informative and full of wit, which really makes this book a very enjoyable read.  For those of you who are trivia buffs, this book was a companion to the BBC production in the early 80's on Aristocrats.  Though 20 years have passed, this is still an excellent beginning work on a world that many know little about.	2001-07-21

Nothing gives me a greater challenge, or more joy than container gardening.  As a city girl, having the ability to create both flower and vegetable gardens in limited space is a blessing.  HOW to go about the planning, choice of plant material, and care of a container garden or raised bed left me with many unanswered questions.  This book answered all of them.<br />The first thing that the authors do is to challenge your thinking about just what consitutes a garden.  Increasingly, people who live in apartments or townhouses with small areas have been able to transform their surroundings with the use of planters and containers &amp; householders who have patios can add an instant garden simply by building raised beds.  Those who do have the space to plant anything that they want can ALSO opt for a container garden because of the CONTROL that it offers.  Living in N.Y.C., I have seen fire escapes, patios, roof gardens &amp; porches transformed into beautiful, colorful, inviting spaces by using these methods.  As someone who prizes fresh fruits and vegetables, containers have been my method of gardening.  The authors give you options too: you can have a container garden that you can move from one area to another or permanent planters that are built  to fit a house's architecture.  This book gives you excellent samples of the various materials available for this purpose, and how to preserve and finish them.<br />  The rest of the book shows you the various types of pots and planters which are available, and samples of various raised beds.  The color photos are quite good and give you many excellent plant combinations. My favorite was on page 47, which showed a stunning example of Conifers, Japanese Maples, blubs, Annuals, and Perennials.  Again, the Crandall's prove that the only limits are those that you put on your own imagination.<br />  The last section deals with soil mixes &amp; fertilizers and superbly handles the organic vs. chemical fertilizer debate.  Maintaining your garden is well addressed with a chapter on pests and how to eliminate them. I was impressed with the straightforward manner in which the authors present all of this material.  Reading this book was truly enjoyable, and will make anyone a gardener!ing your garden is well addressed with a chapter on pests and how to eliminate them.

When Pope Julius II needed someone to design and create the frescoes for his private appartment in The Vatican, he knew who to call: Raphael; and what staggering frescoes they are!<br />  The frescoes are part of the Stanza della Segnatura which contain the famous School of Athens, and The Triumph Of Religion.  These 2 works are found on the largest walls.  Also included are The Stanza dell'Incendio and The Stanza d'Eliodoro.<br />  What makes this book so sensuous and stunning are the beautiful color photographs that husband and wife team Maurice &amp; Jacqueline Guillaud have taken.  Full of spectacular close-ups, you immediately get the full force of Raphael's vivid pallette.  One of the trademarks of the Guillaud's is to print all of their photographs on onionskin paper, which has the look of paint on fresh plaster.  This is a great way to experience the works of this great artist.	2001-06-23

The Art of Benin first came onto the world stage in 1897, when the British TOOK thousands of art works which were in the Royal Palace.  The Royal City of Benin was a JEWEL that was DESTROYED by the British.  Many of the pieces went to London.  Others were sold.  For the very first time westerners saw magnificnet pieces of art executed with great technical sophistication.<br />  The Perls Collection consists of 163 objects, and is considered to be the finest collection of Benin Art in the world. The art reflects the life of the OBA who is the central figure in the kingdom.  He rules witth divine right and is believed to have spiritual powers.  The art directly reflects this.  Among the works found in this catalogue are the heads of the OBA and the Queen Mother, which are executed in both wood and brass.  These heads were just some of the items placed on the royal altar.  Other items were royal altar tusks which were carved with figures of Kings, Queen Mothers, Priests, warriors and other figures.  There are brass figures of court attendants, foreigners &amp; priests.  One will also find Altar Tableaus which consists of symmetrical, standing figures.  Other objects placed on the Royal Altars were brass bells &amp; rattle-staffs.  Another symbol of the court is the brass rooster, which commemorate the Queen Mothers of Benin, ivory containers, And ivory trumpets.  At the end of the book is an excellent chapter on the art of the Yoruba Kindoms which were greatly influenced by the Benin court.<br />  I am pleased that this great collection is housed in my home town of New York City, and that the Metropolitan Museum of Art has produced this excellent catalogue!	2001-06-21

The emotion it aroused obsessed them and fertilised their imaginations, leaving clear marks on their own canvases and sculptures.'  -From the Preface<br />Perhaps no other art has had the impact on Modern Art &amp; artists the way African Art has.  Indeed, the connection is forcefully asserted in this glorious, limited edition book that I am really pleased and proud to own.  Divided into 5 sections: Terracotta, Metal, Ivories, Statuary and Environmental (Utilitarian objects such as Bowls, Cups, Neckrests, Spoons, Stools, and Weapons) you immediately see the creme de la creme of African Art.  That is no idle boast either, because the works featured in this book were all selected by a specially formed committee of the Foundation Dapper, with the following criteria: all were unpublished  works of art, and are not for sale.  Over 85 different african tribes and their art are very well represented here in full and 3/4 page color and black &amp; white photographs, that reflect a very rich heritage and cultural tradition.  The respect, awe, and love for the art of this great continent really leaps off the pages!  Five stars is really not enough.  I wish I could give it 10!	2001-06-17

And yes, it was BEFORE the massive and EVIL  slave trade.<br />  Known as the Afro-Portuguese Ivories, these pieces went  to Portugal, and were created for wealthy patrons who often sent models of  items that they wanted to be reproduced in ivory to African artists.  Examples included: coats of arms, salt cellars, hunting scenes, religious  subjects, oliphants, weapons, forks &amp; spoons, and pyxes.<br />  This  catalogue gives an in depth, scholarly examination of the major groups who  produced these MAGNIFICENT pieces, the intermingling of styles and how they  came about, the European perceptions of Black Africans in the Renaissance,  and the similarities between the TWO groups (an eye opener!!).  203  MASTERPIECES grace the 255 pages, in both color and black &amp; white  photographs.<br />  I cannot imagine anyone who is interested in African Art  &amp; History NOT wanting to find this GORGEOUS book, or better still,  BEGGING Prestel Publishers ( who ALWAYS put out EXCELLENT African Art  books) to reprint it.

Cellar door prices are  listed in German Marks, which is useless, unless you are in Germany and are  going to buy from the producers directly.

I certainly wish that I had this book before I started reading Jane Austen, because it would have answered many of my questions.  I had tried  to use the dictionary and was not always successful.  Daniel Pool's   excellent book changed all of that!       Have you ever wondered why Fanny  Price was so dizzy after drinking NEGUS?  What exactly was the difference  between a GIG and a CURRICLE?  Where in the Order of Precedence did Sir  William Lucas fall as a BARONET?  It is all here in this thoroughly  engaging and delightful book.  It is here that I finally learned about the  daily life of 19th-century England, and the overall social structure of the  time.  Jane Austen is not the only author covered: Charles Dickens, George  Eliot, The Brontes, Thomas Hardy, and Anthony Trollope are well discussed.   The glossery is excellent, and full of terms that I could not find even  when I used The Oxford Dictionary.  The only area that needed further  clarification was the chapter about Entails and Protecting The Estate.  I  never quite understood how Miss Ann De Bourgh was able to inherit her  father's estate upon his death, since &quot;A girl should not inherit  because if she remained single the line could die out and if she married  the estate would pass in possession to someone outside the family.&quot;   (see pg. 90 hardcover edition)  Apart from that, I still feel comfortable  giving this book 5 stars, and would advise anyone who loves 19th-century  English Literature to add it to their collection.  It is a great reference  guide of the period.	2000-08-13

The Great Houses Of Paris is an exquisitely illustrated history of the  grand town houses known as &quot;Hotel Particuliers.&quot;  They are  considered to be the equivilent of the Italian Palazzi.  This work examines  their rise and near fall from the Middle Ages, through the Second Empire.  All of them are now Historic Residences.  Size was not a crucial  criterion for these sumptous town houses to be designated &quot;Hotel  Particulier,&quot;  but, rather an owner's rank and wealth. This work is  most successful in tracing the social and political history in which these  mansions survived.  Indeed, many notables graced the grand salons, such as  Thomas Jefferson, And Madame De Pompadour, and with this book we can get a  glimpse into the past and how these people lived.  Today, few of these  grand houses remain in private hands, and many have been turned into  luxurary apartments.<br />  Overall, A highly important work that makes a  first-rate contribution to the history of Architecture.	2000-08-07

Throughout the book, he  profiles 100 of the world's exceptional wines, and apart from the  &quot;Giants,&quot; there are some great ones that many people have not  heard of and are well worth trying.

I became enamoured of the works of Sir Anthony Van Dyck in large part because of my Art History studies at Brooklyn College with Professor Susan Koslow. I am well aware of the work that the author, Christopher Brown, has done on Anthony Van Dyck, so I knew that I would not be disappointed with this excellent book about his drawings. This book features the preparatory drawings for many of his greatest works. Van Dyck had long been admired for his draughtmanship, and in examining these interesting drawings one can see why. They are revealing in that when one sees the elegant, flawless, finished paintings, you would never suspect that he at times labored over his works. Many drawings show that he made compositonal changes. One is also struck by the intensity that seems to leap off the page. The book is divided into sections reflecting the artist's periods in the cities in which he was active. The first section deals with Antwerpt, 1615-1621. Of particular interest are the preliminary drawings for The Carrying of The Cross, which is not the only religious subject that the artist focused on. The Taking of Christ was another, excuted in red chalk. Mythology was also well represented during Van Dyck's Antwerp period in the work Diana and Actaeon, c. 1618-1621, along with Venus and Adonis, which was executed during the same period. His Italian period is here too, (1621-1627) where religious subjects are again pursued, but something more: his aristocratic portraits for noble Italian families. This is where I feel Van Dyck was truly amazing, in his portraiture. His second Antwerpt period of 1628-1632 shows his more sophisticated, elegant portraiture, and incredible detail. The portrait of Cornelis van der Geest in both the preliminary drawing and finished painting must be seen to be believed, especially the detail of the moisture in the subject's eyes! His English period is also well represented with his famous preliminary drawings for the English Court of King Charles, and various aristocrats. I was also struck by his landscape drawings which are also included in this work.<br />All of these drawings were part of an exhibition at The Pierpont Morgan Library in 1991. I cannot imagine anyone who loves the work of Anthony Van Dyck not wanting this book! It gives us a deeper understanding of the artist and his astonishing work!arious aristocrats.

What was particularly useful was detailed information about the  various wine producing regions, the major vinyards, and how to read labels,  which at times can be confusing. All of this gives the reader enough  information to make really good choices.  What was a welcome surprise was  the section on the Czeck Republic and Slovenia, and the quality wines that  they produce.  The section on the United States could have been longer, and  I expect that to be expaned in updated editions.  Overall, an excellent  book on wine.	2000-08-03

Linley is an excellent modern day interpreter of  classicism, which is evident by his furniture designs which are featured  throughout this beautiful book.  He goes into detail about the great  furniture makers such as, Chippendale, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton.  He also  discusses the influence of some of the great architects such as Adam and  Kent.  I had the good luck to see up close, one of Linley's biggest  commissions: The conference table in The Board of Trustee's Room at the  Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was more than cleverly done.
