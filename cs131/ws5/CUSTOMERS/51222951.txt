They're both Scandinavian writers of police procedurals, and both have a strong central detective character - Sejer in Fossum's case and Wallander for Mankell. <br />Mankell's Wallander is arguably more famous, and inspires people to make the pilgrimage to Ystad in Sweden. Karin Fossum hasn't rooted her novels quite so explicitly, but this one is more Mankell like in that respect, being set firmly in the village of Elvestad in Norway. <br />What this does is make you compare the two novelists even more closely. And what you discover is that Karin Fossum is beating Mankell at his own game. <br />`Calling Out For You' is beautifully constructed and written. It's clear to me now that Fossum is much the better writer: her characters are finely drawn, her dialogue real, her writing much more subtle and convincing. And yet she's just as good at creating tension, describing the workings of her star detective and his appealing sidekick, Skarre. <br />Where Mankell clumsily describes his characters, Fossum does it with great skill. In fact, Karin Fossum's greatest talent is getting a handle on the psychological twists and turns of a murder and its subsequent investigation. Instead of focusing entirely on one character, we see the events through all the characters, and I'm particularly impressed this time. The way the people of Elvestad individually and collectively react to a murder in their midst is exceptionally well woven. By the time you reach the end, you will have a very strong impression of what the murder has done to every character. <br />It's a neat story too, simple in itself but revealing and creating all kinds of complications and unexpected results. The plot has a very `clean' quality to it, yet it is far from obvious what the outcome will be. The writing is equally simple, but also rather beautiful in its economy. <br />All in all, I would say this is the best Karin Fossum yet, and quite possibly superior to anything Mankell has produced. Very highly recommended.	2005-08-11

The early books were about criminals, often loners. There was always some connection with national or world issues like immigration or racial tension, but the clever bit was how one small event in Ystad reflected world trends.  Lately though, Mankell is concentrating on more and more unlikely situations to, presumably, give the books a bigger impact. The trouble is, it has the opposite effect.  The last book, 'Firewall', had Ystad at the centre of a bunch of criminals infiltrating a computer network with the intention of world domination. It spoiled the book somewhat. In 'Before the Frost' it's a group of religious fundamentalists (how topical) with a 'grand plan'.  And I think Mankell's problem here is that even he doesn't really know what this grand plan is. So he has trouble describing it. The actions of the fundamentalists are a series of pseudo-symbolic acts, like burning animals, and putting women-who've-had-abortions to death. It's empty stuff, melodramatic, and dull. It doesn't move the plot along and feels like Mankell was struggling with his material.  The rest of the book deals with soon-to-be police officer, Linda Wallander, and her relationship with her father, our beloved Kurt. But even here, the writing is untypically stilted, and there are some downright unbelievable scenes. For instance, Linda has an argument with Kurt at the Police Station and throws a glass ashtray at him, making him bleed profusely. I didn't believe this scene at all. Much of the dialogue in the book, especially between Linda and her father, or Linda and her friends, is highly unrealistic and difficult to voice.  When Mankell gets back to the things he's good at, the novel is fine though. He's good at describing the Skne landscape. He's phenomenally good at creating tension, suspense and atmosphere. He's good at describing the way the police station works.  'Before the Frost', more than any other Wallandernovel, makes you think about what he's not so good at: dialogue is the chief culprit. He's okay when it's police matters, but he just doesn't have an ear for ordinary dialogue like, say, the Norwegian crime writer Karin Fossum, which makes me think it's not just a translation problem.  I'm not sure he's so great at writing from a woman's perspective either. Linda's character is not nearly as compelling nor empathetic as Kurt's. She's at times gloomy, like Kurt, at times childlike, and girly, but rarely realistic. Her previous life events are what define her, and they're like something from a 'build a character' kit. I'm not sure I look forward to the next Linda Wallander mystery.  All these criticisms aside, I still largely enjoyed the book, though I found much of the melodramatic religious stuff tedious. There are moments of great tension and horror, just like in any Mankell crime novel, but it seems to be spread more thinly than usual.  It makes me glad there's a Kurt Wallander novel ('The Man Who Smiled') still untranslated. Somehow I know it'll be better than this.	2005-01-14

The format and quality of printing is very attractive. <br />C20th Cars is a worthy addition, but I wondered about some of the included models, and some of those left out. I suppose everybody has different ideas about 'significance', but for instance, TWO Ford Sierras, but no Focus? I couldn't help notice, just on first glance, one or two obvious errors in the technical details too. <br />Even so, I would still recommend it, especially as part of an interesting series of handy reference books.	2005-01-05

I suppose the cars themselves are minimalist, in a way, and definitely `arty'. Even so, the book looks like it would be about cutting-edge Italian kitchenware, not ancient oily cars.  To some extent, the book is a triumph of form over function, certainly if you thought its function was to provide information in detail about microcars. No, it doesn't do that.  There's barely any text, and most pages have no more than one or two photographs, so it really just gives you a fleeting impression of things.  There's a section about people and their microcars, a brief section about the history of the little devices, and an A-Z of the main manufacturers.  So, it's nicely produced, would look nice on your Ikea coffee table, but won't tell you all that much about the subject.	2005-01-04

The book covers relatively basic topics like the Finder, saving files, navigation, file management etc. As a lifelong Windows user, it all seems pretty familiar stuff.<BR>What it doesn't cover, except in passing, is stuff like how to use the Superdrive, or standard OSX Applications. Oh, they get a half-page mention, but this isn't the book that tells you everything in great detail.<BR>Think of it more as a starting point. But at least it isn't daunting and over-technical.<BR>I found the endlessly jokey tone of the writing a little irritating, like being with a used-car salesman. It's a little bit &quot;loud&quot; if you know what I mean. I also wasn't that impressed by the illustrations which often seem to be on a different page to the one they're described on, needlessly.<BR>Anyway: it's pretty cheap, a quick read, easy to understand, but don't expect in-depth information.	2004-01-13

After I read the book (it's the sort of book that you read quickly, with excitement) I wanted to go back and re-design all those things I was disappointed with but didn't know how to fix.<BR>It all seems so obvious now!<BR>This is so good, I've also ordered Robin Williams' more advanced book.	2003-09-29

The book does mention some of the more obvious trips you might make from the capital, but concentrates on the city itself.<br />It's a bit like a mini Rough Guide. Not stuffy, seems to know about the 'in' places to eat and be seen, the cool places to go, and yet has all the basic, sensible stuff you'll want to know about a city before you go there.<br />I'd say it's just about on the money.	2003-05-02

There are 177 pages in the Icelandic-English section, so you can guess that there are in truth, not many words.<br />When you're doing a simple translation from English to Icelandic, this isn't too much of a problem, because if you're a native English speaker, you can always find a substitute word if you can't find the one you really wanted in this little dictionary.<br />But when it's the other way around, it's a big, big problem. To test it, I downloaded the daily free newspaper in Icelandic from the Morgunblaðið website, and attempted to translate some simple articles using this dictionary. Barely one in ten of the words used in the newspaper were in the dictionary.<br />So for that, it was useless.<br />You may find it more useful if you're good at recognising the irregular declensions, or at splitting compound words into their components, but even then, I think you will find that this dictionary simply doesn't have the vocabulary. In fact, it barely meets the definition of a dictionary.<br />Think of it as an expanded phrase book and you'll be nearer the mark but then, it doesn't contain any phrases.<br />Unfortunately, there isn't much else on the market unless you can get something from Iceland itself which would be expensive. If you really need to translate even the simplest of texts, this book won't do.	2003-04-26

I'm going again soon and I've decided I want to at least understand a little of what I hear and read, even though \\"talarðu ensku?\\" (do you speak English) is a question you hardly need ask in Iceland. Learning a little of the language is all part of the fun!<br />Having tried and discarded the impenetrable \\"Teach Yourself\\" book, I came across this, and find it much more approachable.<br />I highly recommend getting the tape/CD that goes with this book. It really helps you understand how words sound when they are strung together in phrases and sentences. And it helps you get a handle on the subtleties of pronunciation. Without the tape/CD, it would be much less enjoyable.<br />Thankfully, the book starts out very simply, with greetings, pleasantries, \\"my name is\\" etc. The progression is well judged, so you don't quickly feel out of your depth, and it's satisfying to realise that the things you learn early in the book make sense later on. There are exercises to do, here and there, if you want.<br />I'd definitely recommend this to beginners who are more interested in starting to understand day to day Icelandic than studying Icelandic grammar. It doesn't give you lists of conjugations and declensions to learn, but gradually and gently introduces new elements of the language so that you don't feel overwhelmed, and genuinely feels like an aid rather than a hindrance.<br />A warning though: if you're not quite familiar with ENGLISH grammar, you'll reach a point in even this book that could be a stumbling block. Make sure you at least know the difference between the direct and indirect object before you get to the chapter about declensions!	2003-03-03

This book assumes that you already understand something of the way Icelandic works. And it assumes that you know ENGLISH grammar pretty well. If you don't, you might want to get a book on English grammar at the same time so you know what this book is talking about.<br />This was the first Icelandic book I bought, and at first I discarded it as useless. Then I spent some time with Daisy Neimann's 'Colloquial Icelandic' and came back to this one when I felt a little more comfortable with the basics. Now it starts to make sense.<br />It's a bit like a school book, but I think useful for those fairly tedious taks that you can't avoid, like learning how to decline nouns, adjectives, prepositions...<br />Having said that, it does seem old fashioned. The long list of idioms near the back are full of archaic phrases that seem a pointless inclusion. I notice that the letter 'z', abolished by the Icelanders some time ago, also makes an appearance throughout this book.	2003-02-23
US	51222951	RRDNLYGB5Z2EN	1400031575	342108579	Faceless Killers	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Intriguing, atmospheric, compelling	This is a fairly straightforward story: an elderly couple are brutally murdered, and through sheer determination, and a bit of good luck, the police, headed by the central character Kurt Wallander, solve the crime. As you'd expect.<br />It's well done though, in a Scandinavian sort of way. It's not just that the action takes place in and around Ystad in Sweden. There's a definite feeling of Scandinavian calm about the novel, despite the subject matter. And also a suggestion of the often supposed, though rarely true in my experience, Scandinavian seriousness, graveness, literalness, whatever.<br />Some of that may be down to the translation. At times the writing has an almost childlike quality to it; or perhaps it's just a \\"matter-of-fact-ness\\". It's not unappealing.<br />What Mankell is good at is making you feel the chilly Swedish landscape. Ever-threatening is the weather, closing around the police as they close around the killers. It's like the elements are in league with the criminals sometimes, and it gives the book quite a creepy feeling.<br />Mankell doesn't pay much attention to the other characters in the book; Wallander is the main man. But Wallander's crumbling personal life is described quite well, and threatens to derail his life constantly. The way he pulls through the problems of the murders, the weather and his personal life, to succeed, is perhaps the central attraction and theme of Faceless Killers.<br />A good read. And quite an easy read. But nonetheless satisfying.	2003-01-22

It's (mostly) written from the point-of-view of its two protagonists, Desmond and Jane. Their stories are different at the start of the novel but they meet and their stories intertwine.<BR>Woven around their combined quest to find the truth about the life of a little-known singer (for a TV documentary they're making) are their personal quests to find the truth about their own relationships. Looking for meaning in relationships is familiar ground for Stephen McCauley.<BR>Familiar characters too: Desmond, a gay man from New York with no particularly endearing characteristics, and Jane, rather stereotypical career-woman with a husband she doesn't find attractive any more.<BR>These rather unpromising characters are matched by an equally unpromising central plot-line. Not much to work with then.<BR>And I think that Stephen McCauley makes fairly heavy weather of the material he has lumbered himself with. Which is a shame, considering how light and deft his previous work is.<BR>The saving grace for Desmond and Jane, who spend the entire novel looking for a reason to tell the story of \\"Pauline Anderton\\" is that they make an a astonishing discovery. Great for them, but for the reader, it comes too late and seems like an attempt to salvage a flagging plot.<BR>Up until then, nothing much happens that surprises or interests, and we grind through the quite unattractive lives of characters we can't care much about. The writing is inelegant too: there's too much detail about, well, everything, and none of it adds to the story. It's neither significant, nor particularly interesting. It's just padding.<BR>There are a few quirky characters, but even the most potentially interesting one, Rosemary, is given a \\"hammy\\" B-movie part to play. Jane's child, Gerald, is perhaps the most interesting character, but again he's handled without much subtlety.<BR>I'd say that this is McCauley's least satisfying work to date, unfortunately.	2003-01-20

The child-abuse subtext is peculiar, cheaply handled perhaps. The ending is surreal and disconnected.<BR>Grimsley writes in a dreamy cloud, but skims the surface. I started to wonder about the meaning of Nathan's return at the end (was it really him or his ghost that came back...) but decided it was like trying to psychoanalyze a soap opera.<BR>Ultimately, a flimsy, rather pointless novella.	2003-01-02

I would like to be able to say that you can hardly see the join, but well, you can. One story will be strangely familiar to those who have already read Fry's delightful MOAB IS MY WASHPOT: cleverclogs schoolboy outwits teachers, falls into his own bad company but saves himself from the mire in the end to become a great success. It's the Stephen Fry story. The other is a spy story, or so it appears, which presumably has nothing to do with the real Stephen Fry. Fry teases us throughout with the spy story, inserting bits of it here and there in between the schoolboy stuff. He further tests us by jumbling the order of the schoolboy story, which is on the whole cleverly done. It means that you're constantly trying to guess why this or that is significant. It works. But I found the transition from schoolboy to spy an awkward and tenuous one. It depends on a big lie to the reader (or at least a big omission) that seems unfair, and not at all satisfying. The quality of the writing fades too in the second part. Adrian changes from the impossibly witty to something quite dull; he is puzzlingly upstaged and it doesn't quite add up. And yet, and yet... The novel overcomes its difficulties and you more or less forgive it. Because it really is laugh-out-loud funny, and a true page-turner. The main character may be disgustingly clever, but there's enough humility and vulnerability for you to fall for him hook line and sinker. And even the spy story has twists enough to guarantee you'll get right to the slightly obvious ending in no time at all.	2001-09-03

Thought not. It seemed to me that Leavitt thought he'd better write a  book called The Page Turner before anybody else did, then pretended to  himself that any old story would do.<br />Very nearly a waste of time.	1999-12-16

And although it's not one of his &quot;important&quot; novels, you'll also have read something light,  amusing and quaint in a similar way to Grand Babylon Hotel.	1999-11-26

Rendevous With Rama was a breathless 1 day read, full of tension and amazement. It leaves you desprately trying to picture the thing in your mind. Rama II is simply drivel. Clarke tries to  give us lots of stuff about his &quot;characters&quot; but writes like a  schoolboy. Who cares about the characters? You won't, that's for sure. Then  there are the tedious, naive descriptions of the earth's history since the  first Rama.... skip past them. In fact skip the whole book. Or read  Rendevous again which is a classic. Or go and find something else. Don't  waste your money.	1999-06-30
