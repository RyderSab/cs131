Cornwall does not  directly convict Pius XII of direction collaboration with the Nzis, but  rather convicts him of moral hyporacey.  This biography of the wartime pope  is well written and clear states the point that the Papacy did not do  enough, if anything for the Jewish communities across Catholic Europe.   Cornwall points out the major falacies in the Vatican Foreign Policy that  directly impilcates them in some sort of chots with the Nazi regime.   Eugenio Pacelli, Pius XII, was a diplomat, first and foremost.  He sought  to keep at any cost the Roman Catholic Church in power of some sorts.  In  1933, he sealed the fate of democracy in Germany by forcing the last  &quot;hold out&quot; politcal party, the Centre Party, to fold;  thus  allowing for Hitler's unopposed declaration of being Furher and the  creation of a dictatorship.  Cornwall accuses the Church of covering up the  exeact role of the pope.  Cornwall throughout the biography concludes that  the mass externination of European ethnic minorites:  mainly Jews and  Gipseys, could have been avoid if Pope Pius XII said something along the  lines of &quot;this is wrong and should not be done.&quot;  Instead the  pope remained silent.  The pope while thousands of Roman Jews marched  across Rome, in view of Vatican City, watched and did nothing.  The  Christmas 1942 address did not devreed the Nazis one bit and if anything  angered teh Allies.  The pope had a moral duty to save and he did nothing.   Cornwall conclusion of Pius XII is correct and unforchante.  This biography  creates Pius XII in a way that makes him so undesirable and dispicable that  is makes you sick to believe that this man was cannonized by Pope John Paul  II.  Anybody who is remotely interested in the topic should read this book.	2000-02-06

Speer comes close, but does not fully comprehend his role and actions during the Second World War.  He tells  Gitta Serney a very emotional account of his life and his own personal  trials and tribulations.  This fantastic account of Speer's life makes the  reader feel as though: I have actually meet this man.  But you know you  have not.  Although Speer is not hear to take questions about this book,  Gitta Serney gives the man a sence of justice.  Gitta uses basic question  to stir and jog the memory of the aging Speer and her account of this  interview is a wonderful insight to the man who was closest to Hitler.	2000-02-01

He gives us an understanding and profile of Hitler like no one  else can -- because he was his &quot;only friend.&quot;  Speer recites his  encounters and actions with feeling and expands on his emotional distress  of choosing between his boss and nation.  While the end of the war was  looming, he challenged Hitler and at the Nuremberg Trials, his defence of  collective guilt brought some sort of comfort to him as the trial  progressed.  Speer's accounts are priceless and he helps put into  perpective the true horros of the war of 1939-1945.	2000-01-28
