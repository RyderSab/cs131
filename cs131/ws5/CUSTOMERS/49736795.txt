US	49736795	R1ZPVYIEIAVUH	0689819145	228237439	Mr. Was	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Intelligent reading for teens	I happened upon on old Advance Reader's Copy at my local used bookstore today and read it straight through.  This is a terrific time travel mystery for teens.  Mr. Hautman uses the device of having 'found' the writings, journals, and government papers that make up the novel.  The whole package works well - Jack (Mr. Was) is a character that readers will care very much about.  The mystery is convoluted enough to keep the reader's mental skills challenged, and all of the questions and story elements are tied up well at the end.  I particularly liked the fact that the Boggs family's disappearance is is reintroduced at the novel's conclusion.  It gives the reader a whole other time travel mystery that he or she can speculate about.  This would be great for a teen reading group, there are many social issues and imaginative questions posed in this novel.	2000-10-21

As a rule, I believe that readers who don't finish a book should not review it so do not weigh this review too heavily.  The Poisonwood Bible, Kingsolver's last book, was an incredible work of literature and one of the best books I've ever read.  I opened Prodigal Summer with high expectations of being treated to an equally compelling novel, and I think many fans of the earlier book will do the same.  If you intend to read this, throw those expectations out the window and perhaps you'll see more merit in it than I did.  This is just my opinion - I'm sure that other readers will have differing opinions, and I look forward to reading them here.  If I've erred in my assessment of Prodigal Summer after reading about half of it, please write a review...do I need to give it more time?	2000-10-20

While I think that Jane Hamilton is one of the finest contemporary authors, I don't think that this book is up to her usual standards.  Perhaps the main focus of the novel should have been on Elvira - easily the most complex and interesting character in the book.  Henry comes alive only when interacting with his female high school friend; the rest of the time he is too detached to elicit empathy.  Beyond telling Elvira's story, I didn't see a point to the book.  Henry and his parents disappointed me, Elvira delighted me.	2000-10-19

The interjections of the narrator force the reader to focus not only on Saffie's story, but to pull back from this narrow focus and absorb the author's bigger message.  Her message is a grim one - that history teaches us little, and that human beings will continue to abuse and murder one another with the belief that their cause is right and justifiable.  I think the reader could have understood the message with a little less input from the narrator whose voice was, at times, intrusive and tended to state the obvious.  This is a novel that delivers a disturbing assessment of mankind, but it is beautifully written and gives the reader much food for thought.  I will forever think of the philtrum (that funny little dent between your nose and your upper lip) as &quot;the mark of the angel&quot; now, and remember Ms. Huston's powerful book and message as I do.	2000-10-16

This novel is very light on archeology, and the promise of mystery is not delivered.  It took an inordinate amount of time for Ms. Malarkey to set up the story and by the time she did I was so bored with the characters that I didn't care at all what happened to them.

One thing that I find commendable about fiction writers like Karen Cushman is that they bring history to life for young readers.  It's one thing to study medieval times in the classroom, but when a young person can absorb that history through the fictional life of a character in a story, history becomes much more interesting.  Karen Cushman has always succeeded on that level with her earlier books, and does so in this one also.  I think that another reason this new book succeeds is because it offers the story of a character out of her own element.  Matilda leaves all that she finds familiar and comfortable, to enter an existence where all her rules of life until now no longer apply.  The culture clashes that follow provide the reader with humor, and encourage empathy for Matilda.  I bet that each young person who reads this will wonder, &quot;What would I do in that situation?&quot;.  And with that question in mind, the reader will be hooked on the story of Matilda Bone.  What more could an author (or reader) want than that?	2000-10-05

I am always completely drawn into Stephen King's characters - they live and breathe for me - and that's why I am such a big fan of his work.  Although the events and situations are not within the realm of my experience (or anyone else's, I hope!), it is the fact of the believability of the characters that make them so darn scary.  This little (for King) book sheds some light on how he manages that remarkable feat of making the reader believe in his story people, and his stories.  The first third of the book is a memoir of his time spent becoming a writer, which I found to be  fascinating (I didn't know about his substance abuse), friendly, and frightening (a babysitter from hell!).  The whole book reads like an intimate, relaxed visit on the back porch with an old buddy and I loved the time I spent visiting with a well-loved author.  I have just one question - What's behind that cellar door on the cover?	2000-10-04

What intrigued me about this novel were the various gimmicks (to use  reviewer David Eustace's term).  Without them, if the story had been  relayed in a chronological manner, all of the mystery and much of the  wonder would have been absent.  Ms. Atwood has given the reader several  challenges with this novel - what events and emotions shaped Iris as we see  at the end of her life?  Who are the mysterious lovers whose clandestine  meetings fill a third of the book?  What is the answer to the mystery of  both Laura's and Richard's disappearance?  And why is the story of the  blind assassin integral to the overall novel?  I loved putting the clues  together bit by bit as I read.  This book demands more from the reader than  most books, for it is a process that the author and the reader enter into  together - a process of readjusting suppositions and unraveling the  mysteries Ms. Atwood presents.  I only gave it four stars, however, because  I found the ending to be unsatisfying.  The buildup was much too complex  and powerful to be resolved in such ordinary answers.  Iris is, however, a  completely fascinating character and is well worth the time and effort the  reader spends to enter and understand her life.	2000-09-13

Or do you have ambitions to write?  I highly recommend this book for both groups, as well  as for young adults who just love short story collections.  The first story  about a high school fencer, by Jerry Lubar, was my favorite.  It appeals to  that part in all of us that loves to root for the underdog, and see him  come out on top.  It's also delightfully funny!  It reminded me very much  of Chris Crutcher's writing. Not all of the stories are as strong as  Lubar's, but I love the collection anyway.  Each story is prefaced by a  note from the author, telling what inspired the author to write THIS  particular story.  It helps budding authors to see where writers get their  ideas and, perhaps more interesting, WHY they get their ideas.  It also  shows the aspiring writer that there are many different ways to tell a  story - whether in a straight forward format (most of the stories), a prose  poem interview (Mel Glenn's Kids in the Mall), or an unconventional nursery  rhyme (John Scieszka's Thirteen Diddles).  The prefaces also allow the  reader to see the authors as real live once-upon-a-teen people, who just  happened to grow up and make their living by writing. A word of warning,  however - THIS IS NOT, as a previous reviewer said,  a book for the Harry  Potter lover.  I love the Rowling books, but this is not designed to serve  the reader in the same way.  Don't buy it thinking that it is similar in  any way to the Potter books.  Do buy it if you are intrigued by the process  of writing, if you like short stories, or if you enjoy learning about how  authors work their magic on readers.	2000-09-10

This is a perfectly adequate thriller, guaranteed to be a one-night read, with it's short chapters and many plot twists and turns.

However, if you're looking for a thriller that breaks new ground by  introducing unique characters, you won't find it here.  There is the  obligatory beautiful/smart/reckless/young heroine and several  evil/smart/ruthless/possible-sociopathic-serial-killers, and several points  in the book when ALL the clues point to a new and different  possible-sociopathic-serial-killer, but there is nothing to set this this  thriller apart.

What if the daily struggle for food and shelter became the utmost priority in our world?  Who would be  considered of value in the society that followed?  Ms. Lowry has given  readers a story with all the impact of her earlier book, The Giver.   Gathering Blue is also a novel set in the possible future, where insular  towns and villages have developed, and contact between them is almost  nonexistent.  In one of these villages, the reader is introduced to a young  girl named Kira.  Through Kira's eyes, the reader is gradually pulled in to  discover the horrifying, and entirely possible, secret of Kira's world.   Gathering Blue is absolutely stunning in the concepts it presents; I'm  certain that teachers will want to incorporate this powerful book into  their reading curriculum.  Along with Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli and  Matilda Bone by Karen Cushman, Gathering Blue will be among the top  contenders for next year's Newbery Award.	2000-08-23

We should all be so lucky as to have our own Stargirl enter our lives, to recognize her when she speaks to us, and wise enough to listen to her  message!

I first discovered Mr. Spinelli several years ago when I read  Maniac Magee.  Wringer and The Library Card absolutely confirmed my status  as a devoted fan of his work.  Although his books are shelved in the young  adult or children's section of bookstores, I believe that his books defy  sole classification.  Any adult or young person who is interested in  quality fiction will find much to love about Jerry Spinelli's books.   Stargirl is a delightful celebration of nonconformity, a book guaranteed to  make the reader smile and think about how we are all connected to one  another, and think about how each of us makes an impact on the people whose  lives we touch.

Alice Hoffman has a command of the written word that is equaled by very few authors.  Her exquisite prose employs all five senses, and when the reader opens one of her novels magic happens.  Sights and smells subtlely  drift from the pages; the sounds of a summer night and the taste of icy  winter air, the caress of a breeze; all entice you to enter her world.  As  with her other novels, The River King allows the reader to see into the  hearts and souls of her characters.  Love is the thing that drives us and  makes us human, Ms. Hoffman tells us. But be careful about whom and how you  love, and about who loves you - while love defines us, it can also destroy  us. Alice Hoffman's skills as a writer are at their finest in two of her  earlier works, Turtle Moon and Practical Magic, but each of her novels,  including The River King, are pleasures that a fiction lover should not  miss.  I would caution you to be careful when you enter her worlds - you  may never want to leave.	2000-07-20

This is a story in which she uses several writing techniques to tell a poignant and powerful story of one young girl searching for her place in  the world, and coming to terms with her difficult past.  The story is  particularly effective in the use of dual diaries, written by Sophie and  her cousin Cody, which give the reader two revealing perspectives on the  past and the present.  Also delightful was the writing technique of  Sophie's stories - told with a fable-like eloquence - of her 'memories' of  a beloved grandfather.  As an adult, I had serious questions aout the  wisdom of the decisions made by the adults in the book (allowing Sophie to  undertake the cross-Atlantic sail in the first place, not dealing with  Sophie's inability to understand and accept her history)but the story is  one that speaks well to the imagination and spirit of adventure of young  girls.  The Wanderer is an excellent choice for Mother/Daughter groups,  with many opportunities for discussion on the craft of writing, and the  importance of finding one's place in the spectrum of family and the world.	2000-07-20

Before I started working as a bookseller, I never bothered with young adult literature, after all, what did that have to do with me - an adult?   But then I discovered writers like Gary Paulsen.  This is among his most  incredible works.  The reader follows the 'life' of a lovingly crafted  weapon, from before the days of the American Revolution when a rifle is  'born', to the present.  The intersection of this rifle and one young boy  is as real as the stories one reads in the paper everyday, and the  description of what could have been completely takes the reader's breath  away.  If you haven't read any of Gary Paulsen's books, you have missed  some absolutely incredible literature - try The Rifle, Nightjohn, A  Soldier's Heart, Hatchet, or his wonderfully funny and poignant My Life In  Dog Years.  I have my fingers crossed that Mr. Paulsen will continue to  provide readers with the gift of his stories for many years to come.	2000-07-10

The Goblet of  Fire sets the reader up nicely for the next installment (oh no! I have to  WAIT for the next one!).

I'll start by saying that I think Gary Paulsen is one of our finest treasures as a writer for young people.  Cody's story will probably appeal to boys - the story is adventurous and action-packed, but I was sorely  disappointed.  Mr. Paulsen has the incredible power to take a stand on big  issues, and let his readers see that issue through the viewpoint of a  single character - he did so on slavery in Nightjohn, on gun control in The  Rifle, and on war in A Soldier's Heart.  Those three books (and some of his  others) absolutely stun the reader with the power of the written word.  The  Whitefox Chronicles doesn't even come close.  This newest book is a nice  little adventure story, but don't look for the awesome impact you have come  to expect from this writer.	2000-07-09

This was the first Scottoline mystery I read, and I liked it so much that I bought the whole series that preceeds this book.  I found Mary DiNunzio to be one of the most believable and likable mystery creations since Nancy  Pickard stopped letting readers into the life of her character of Jenny  Cain.  Scottoline's series has humor, terrifically crafted plot lines, and  characters whom the reader will genuine LIKE and care about.  In a time of  too many &quot;cozies&quot; and too many arrogant heroines (pronouced  &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot;), these mysteries have the perfect balance of  serious plot and lighthearted fun.	2000-07-03

This is a must-have resource item for anyone who reads, and would be incredibly useful for teachers, students, booksellers, and ANYONE who comes in contact with books.  Strouf offers info on poetry, plays, journalism,  classics, contemporary fiction and nonfiction, fables, Shakespeare,  literature references, and so much more.  It's all arranged in a perfectly  easy format and style for reading straight through, or for browsing, or for  looking up specific information on just about anything that's ever been put  into a book.  This is definitely the most useful resource tool I've come  across for understanding and enjoying the written word.  There are a few  typos that are mildly distracting, but the phenomenal wealth of information  contained in this book really make it a something that you will go back to  again and again.  Buy four copies - one for yourself, one for your  reader/friend, and especially one for any student about to enter middle  school, high school, or college.  (That's three, but I guarantee that  you'll find someone else in your life who absolutely has to have this book  once they see yours!)	2000-06-27

Okay, so I'm a grown-up bookseller with fondness for quality young adult literature, and MAYBE that affects my star-giving habits, but not in this case.  Holes is far and away one of the best novels I've ever read and  recommended to anyone, whether that reader is 10 or 100 years old. Every  man, woman, or child who has read this book on my recommendation has loved  it, and recommended to many other readers, who have recommended it to still  more readers.  Holes is one those novels where every single story element  is necessary to the whole - not even a single word in this novel is  extraneous.  The issues presented in the book, which gradually reveal  themselves to the reader, are issues that readers of any age will find  thought provoking - racism, family, cooperation and friendship.  All of  these things are combined in a package that is funny, poignant, touching,  thrilling, and absolutely compelling.  If you are an adult, and your child  is lucky enough to have this book, steal it for an evening or two and read  it.  If you are an adult with kids but no Holes in the house, buy it and  read it before or after or with your child.  If you are a kid, beg your  parent for this book.  Quite simply, if you are a breathing human being,  you need to read this book.  I promise you that will be glad that you did.	2000-06-27

From the very beginning, where Steve the Lust Lizard (almost) enjoys mad, passionate love with a gasoline truck, and all the way through this book, I laughed myself silly.   Moore's books are not deep literature (at least, I don't THINK so! ) but  they are the most fun one can have all by oneself.  I loved it, my dog  loved it, and you'll love it, too.	2000-06-27

If you are a voracious fiction reader, take time out to browse through and get lost in this book.  It really is addictive.  The wealth of information here is astounding - each of the 125 well loved authors in the book has his  or her own two page spread featuring a picture, background info, incredibly  interesting &quot;good to know&quot; facts about the author, which of the  author's books to read first,  Websites featuring even more info about the  author.......and more, and more, and more......  Following the author info  there is more 'book-junkie' information to tempt we readers of fiction;  award winners, dos and don'ts of writing to an author, information on the  different fiction genres.  I see this as a perfect gift for fiction  readers, especially if you don't know what books the recipient has already  read.  It's also an invaluable resource for book groups, teachers, and  booksellers.  An absolute treasure for the bibliophile!	2000-06-27

Andrews-Edwards' writing style is stilted, unnatural, and boring.  The plot  is almost non-existant and ridiculously predictable.  There are no issues  explored or presented in this book.  There are so many wonderful children's  authors out there - Jerry Spinelli, Kathryn Zeatley Snyder, Sharon Creech,  Gary Paulsen, Lois Lowry, David Almond, Louis Sachar, and many, many  others.

Perhaps more importantly though, in these days of you-gotta-have-a-gimmick mysteries (quilting mystery,cooking mystery,Jane Austen mystery,cab-driver mystery.....) no one  has yet to match the unique central character of Caveman's Valentine.   Romulus Ledbetter lets us into his world of schizophrenia and, hopefully by  the end of the book, the reader understands and gains empathy for this  illness that affects one in every hundred people in the U.S..  Romulus  captures our attention, our compassion, and our hearts.  I salute Mr. Green  for finally casting the schizophrenic as the hero in this novel, instead of  the killer at the core of far too many mysteries and thrillers to count.	2000-06-27

Ender is a character that  readers will cheer for with all their heart and soul.  I believe that this  book has two endings.  The first is a heartstopping, action-filled  surprise.  But the second, and final, ending is a message that asks the  reader to rethink what is the importance of being a member of the human  race.  In recent years, this novel has been included in the reading  curriculum of high schools.  I applaud those teachers who are exposing  their students to this novel that poses such important questions and ideas.   I also believe that it is a must-read for any student who has been tagged  as gifted.  On another level, this is darned exciting reading!	2000-06-27

I really disagree with the comparisons between Strout and Anne Tyler, Elizabeth Berg, and Alice Hoffman.  This novel did not have the beautiful lyric quality of Hoffman, the profound humor of Tyler, nor the depth of  character that one finds in Berg's work.  There are so many problems with  this book.  Isabelle is a wooden, pathetic figure of a mother - I wanted to  shake her when her discovery of her daughter's molestation leads her to  abuse her daughter and worry about the intellectual impression she made on  her daughter's molester.  As a mother, my anger would have been directed at  the criminal not the victim! In light of Isabelle's critical, jealous view  of her daughter, why on earth would Amy forgive her - I couldn't.  This is  not the portrayal of a beautiful mother/daughter relationship!  The ending  was completely unbelievable and much too &quot;happily ever after&quot; to  ring true.  I found the use of Fat Bev objectional - wouldn't 'Bev' have  been sufficient and much less discriminatory?I expect I will see quite a  bit of disagreement to this review - perhaps Amazon should change the  wording to &quot;Do you agree with this review&quot;, instead of &quot;Did  you find it helpful&quot; since that seems to be the feedback that is  registered here.	2000-06-12

This book was written years before Harry ever wound up on a publisher's desk, and it should not be viewed in comparison to J.K. Rowling's books.  The value of Platform 13 comes in the delightful opportunities for  imagination and discussion when an adult and a child read it together.  We  used this book for a mother/daughter group and had wonderfully creative  time addressing points in Ms. Ibbotson's book.  What atmosphere is the best  place for a gump, and where would be the best place to find a gump in this  country?  If YOUR child was stolen, who would you send to rescue him or her  - Odge and her friends or the harpies?  (Moms had a surprising answer for  this one.)  Is it true that &quot;when children behave badly it is nearly  always the fault of those who bring them up&quot;?  Other quotes that  sparked spirited debate included, &quot;when you have worked and worked for  something, it is almost impossible to believe that you can fail&quot;, and  &quot;it doesn't matter what your home is like - it's that it's yours that  matters&quot;. This is an ingeniously creative fantasy for pre-teens, and  for those adults who can still see magic in the art of storytelling.  If  you open your mind and your imagination you'll love this book for what it  offers, and not find it necessary to make comparisons. Oh yes, if you're  all grown up, don't forget to check out the harpie with a handbag, who  bears a curious resemblance to a former prime minister...	2000-06-07

One of the best &quot;take me away - I want to get lost in a book&quot; novels I ever read.  I've read it several times, and each time I find myself staying up until the wee hours of the morning to finish it.  One  review I read years ago described this as an Indiana Jones for women - I  agree, but I think it's not FOR women, just ABOUT them.  It's a perfect  blend of history, chess, tantalizing clues, and non-stop action.  As a  bookseller, I've sold this book many times with a money-back guarantee in  case the customer didn't like it and I've never had a single customer bring  it back for a refund.  A word to fans of The Eight, Katherine Neville's  next two novels, A Calculated Risk and The Magic Circle do not live up to  the standards set by The Eight.	2000-06-06

This is a very good thriller, but not special enough to really stand out in the crowd of new books.  The plot development was absolutely terrific - complex and twisty enough to keep any reader turning pages.  However, I  didn't find the character developement to be quite as terrific.  Carol is  interesting, with all her demons and her perfectly justified  self-destructive behavior.  But there is something missing in her make-up  that doesn't allow the reader to care deeply about her and really root for  her.  Pell and the other characters just never seem to come to life.  I  know it must be difficult, as a writer, to begin fresh with a whole new set  of people after introducing someone like Elvis Cole, but this author DID  give us Elvis, and I think his readers wanted someone to connect with in  the same way.  It didn't happen with Carol and Pell.  I still think  Demolition Angel is a fun summer read, definitely satisfying enough to keep  your interest, just not powerful enough to make you want to remember or  revisit the central characters.	2000-06-03

It doesn't have the complexity of plot or the delightful quality of the  magic that can exist in the written word like the above titles do.  I also  thought that the truth about the identity of Bud's background was much too  transparent. But, after re-reading it, and talking to young people about  this book, I changed my mind.  Bud is a storybook character that lives and  breathes for the children who read about him.  He has the same fears,  foibles, and hopes that most young people possess.  His 'Rules For A Better  Life..' bring smiles to the children who read them.  Kids root for Bud with  as much vigor and enthusiasm as they did for Stanley in Holes, Jeffrey in  Maniac Magee, and Jonas in The Giver.  Children are comforted by the fact  that there is a happy ending and that they can see exactly where it is  heading.   So I readjusted my 48 year old way of viewing literature, and  tried to look at this book through the eyes of a child.  From that fresh  viewpoint, this book delivers Newbery-quality entertainment.	2000-05-26

This is a novel of extraordinary intelligence and insight and I am absolutely awed that this  is the work of a first time novelist.  Ms. Goldberg's storytelling is  completely stunning - in examining this family that is veering out of  control, and in telling of Eliza's incredible enlightenment and  transformation.

Hull is definitely a talented writer, and he shows that when he writes about the battle scenes and lasting effect of war on a soldier.  He also exhibits his  talent when he writes about Patrick's life in the nursing home.  But all  that talent is negated by the central theme of the book - Patrick's sappy,  ridiculous, endless mooning over a sneaky fling with his best friend's  widow.  I hate to think that any reader would view that affair, and  Patrick's inability to build a life of any quality afterwards as 'true  love'.  (That IS exactly the message that Bridges of Madison County gave to  readers several years ago, and that novel was utter dreck.)  In all  honesty, if Patrick and Julia had built a life together we may have seen  love develope and grow between them, but endless pining from afar after a  tawdry little affair is NOT true love!  Perhaps Hull should have thrown out  the silly affair element, and we might have seen an excellent novel about  war and aging that he seems capable of writing.	2000-05-12
