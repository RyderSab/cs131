She is no writer, and apparently lacked a capable editor as well. She is crude. There are too many references to sex and drug use. She seems to consider financial success the difference between winners and losers in life, and lacks the grace to realize without her current job she would still be a financial loser. She's a loser to me anyway. This book is not worth reading. Skip it.	2003-04-10

It doesn't say anything most of us don't know. It could have been summed up in five pages or less, too. The sort of people who don't apologize or who give insincere apologies or who demand instant forgiveness also know this stuff and would not read a book like this even if they didn't. I'm surprised this one found a publisher.<br />Beverly Engel has written many other books that are indispensable. Try The Emotionally Abused Woman or Encouragements for the Emotionally Abused Woman instead. Divorcing a Parent is also very good.<br />I was hugely disappointed that the author seemed to repudiate much of what she wrote in Divorcing a Parent in this book, because her own abusive parent finally apologized to her. Whatever she believes about that turn of events or is tempted to believe, I don't think it should have generated another book. It almost seems like a betrayal of her readers, most of whom will not be receiving any such apologies and who may struggle for years to find the strength to cut ties with abusive parents - using her books to shore them up in ways society doesn't.	2003-02-10

The truth within it _is_ startling as another reviewer mentioned. I've reread this many times over the years since someone recommended it to me. Most of it has been underlined, the margins are filled with notes. It's wonderful to reread it and finally see that you have no abusers in your life anymore.    The principles within it will also help you with making decisions about counselors and therapists and assorted other helpers. Don't accept abuse from them either. Frankly, if this is your issue, I wouldn't see a therapist who hasn't read this book.    Get Encouragements for the Emotionally Abused Woman, too. They go very well together and both are worth the money.	2003-02-10

Great book for independent thinkers and informed citizens. If no one in your immediate vicinity validates that you know what you know, see what you see, and feel what you feel (and you're right!), get this book. There's someone out there who gets it.<br />The author doesn't recommend magic pills, or therapy or a 12 step group because you've been taking some other pills to get through the days. He doesn't tell you to make gratitude lists or go to college AGAIN or do anything else conformist and profitable for someone else. He reaffirms your intelligence, validates your perceptions, and your right to speak about them, and reassures you it's your highest calling to be yourself. That is what you can do for your country, your family and your sanity.<br />I gave four instead of five stars because much of the book doesn't apply to me and I found my attention wandering during those chapters. I'm sure parents and teachers will find them invaluable. If you're trying to raise or educate an intelligent, compassionate human being instead of trying to control or manage a future consumer / worker drone, this is the book for you.<br />Also highly recommended for those who considered careers in psychiatry or social work and found themselves ethically compromised and repulsed. The book is a long overdue critique of the psychiatry / psychology industry that, unlike some others, is balanced and intelligent enough not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.<br />This book should be on the shelves in the stores, but I had to order it here. It's worth the wait.	2003-01-04

Fall From Grace by Andrew Greeley is a wonderful parable of grace, set in Chicago, of course. This was the first of his novels that I read and the characters and the book are still dear to my heart.

Greeley has written 43 novels. I believe it is closer to 53 if the truth be told. I myself have read 39 of them so far and this is one of my all time favorites. It is a wonderfully accessible story about the grace of forgiveness and of trying to do better every day, whether other people respond favorably to you or not. I could not recommend this book highly enough.	2001-08-31

Fr. Greeley has delivered an entertaining mystery that is both a breath of fresh air and true to the well-established formula. New characters are as delightful as the old favorites. This one seemed to go very quickly, but is written so well, the images will linger for years, particularly of Mother Marie's wise words about love and a particular wedding ceremony near the end of the book.<br />Not incidentally, there is an especially fine treat for longtime fans of Fr. Greeley's on the back cover of the book - praise for the author's fiction from a member of the Church hierarchy. It is long overdue. I do find it sad, and more than a bit unusual, however, that the author puts a disclaimer on a certain fictional Cardinal's remarks to Blackie in a Note at the end of the book. Has it really come to this? Mon Dieu!	2001-08-29

It IS dense and it is worth every moment spent reading it. You cannot help but find yourself represented somewhere amongst all the respondents surveyed. I have reread it several times over the years and it continues to reassure me and verify my experiences in the Church. I have often been mystified by the presumptions others make about Catholics and Catholicism because the presumptions do not fit my experience at all - and I did not consider my experience or beliefs atypical. The book makes clear the widespread presumptions do not fit with the experiences of entire generations of Catholics in recent history! I would like very much to see a reprint of this book with updated data (or a follow up book). Many of Fr. Greeley's predictions about the Church as it enters the new millenia have no doubt come to pass and I, for one, would like a look at the numbers. It is a great pity Church leaders are not more interested in and responsive to this research. If they were, the Church today would undoubtedly be an even more robust and inclusive home base for Catholics today. This book is also a great treat for fans of the author's novels, which he was inspired to write by some of the findings reported here. This somewhat academic work points up just how deft he is at weaving both harsh and beautiful realities - confirmed by the data, of course - into highly entertaining parables that are themselves unforgettable experiences of grace.	2001-08-27

It is one thing to forgive the distant past of our childhoods, but quite another to put up with abuse as an adult. God bless Beverly Engel for sharing her insights and encouragement. I wish she (or someone) would write another book for people who have NOT been abused explaining why it is inappropriate and sometimes cruel to pressure others, like coworkers or complete strangers, to express love and devotion to their parents no matter what. Would it really cost anyone anything to mind their own business or give another the benefit of the doubt about their most personal choices?	2001-08-24

If you have been broke, or are broke, you may want to cry in recognition and sympathy but will find yourself laughing instead. If you think you don't have the great ability Ms. Nissel has to laugh at your misfortunes, by the time the book is finished you'll realize it isn't too late to start. What perfect justice that turning all this angst around is helping to turn the author's financial situation around. Also, it's about time everyone learns about the evil that is ChexSystems and the nefariousness of banks and parasitic check-cashing outlets as well. REVOLUTION!	2001-08-06
