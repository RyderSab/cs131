I had liked Blindsighted by Karin Slaughter so I thought I'd try this Sara Linton/Jeffrey Tolliver book.  I found the jumping back and forth from the past to the present simply annoying.  I found the characters in the flashbacks quite frankly unbelievable, implausible.  Jeff's mother saying \\"I can smell him on your (rude name for female body part) from here\\", and a double murder and gay sex scandal in the flashback, plus a lot of rape and references to rape and mutilation during the current time, make this book a bit gross - they seem to be gratuitous additions that don't really add to the story.  And except for Sara, the characters in the main timeframe of the book are not appealing either.  I think this is enough of Karin Slaughter for me.	2005-07-09

The story tells about how our hero, Laura, was lured out of semi-retirement and back into investigative action by the possibility of helping her 23-year-old daughter, whom she had not seen in many years.  Interesting converging story lines about a world-wide line of exclusive brothels and about an identity theft ring set up by wireless network from a catalog phone-order center.  You will really like and empathize with the clever Laura, and sympathize with her messed-up personal life.  The plot is intriguing, and features a number of good, well-developed characters.  I am going to see what other books there are by David Cole that I have not read - I _really_ enjoyed this book.  I just got back from a long vacation during which I read a good number of mysteries and thrillers - this one was definitely my favorite!  Read it today.

It is set in a sexually sophisticated world, where most girls have sex with whatever boy they happen to be dating, and it's not that unusual for one of your pals to be known for her proclivity<br />toward oral sex, lots of it...  There is an entertaining story going on behind all of the sex, though, and I'm sure older teens and some adults will enjoy the book.  I found it to be entertaining.  I just wasn't expecting it to be quite this sexy. Not that the sex is explicit.  It is just there, everywhere.<br />\\"Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging\\" has a little less sex in it but enough to fascinate a 13 or 14 year old, I'd say, and it's hysterical.  If you are buying a recent book for a younger teen, try that one.  (If you're buying a book for an 11 or 12 year old, try \\"Zazoo\\" - it's got a great story with just a bit of romance.)	2002-03-20

US	53027219	R1GOC2I3FHOQFM	0752836943	534623006	Nathan Crosby's Fan Mail	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An exceptionally good mystery	I found this book in the new books section of my local library.  It was is a fun, relatively quick-and-easy-to-read mystery.  The characters are well-developed, interesting and engaging.  The book is about the author of a murder mystery.  The author has an anonymous fan who treats the author as if the author were a character in his murder mystery.  The anonymous fan recreates the murders in that murder mystery, sequentially, following the murder mystery chapter by chapter.  The author, both on his own and somewhat cooperating with the police, needs to find the fan before he reaches the end of the book, because the end of the book is where the character in the book's wife gets murdered.  (It is hard to explain, but easy to follow.  This is a fun book, not a deep, challenging book.) The setting is familiar to Dick Francis fans: horse barns and racetracks in England.  This book was a lot of fun to read, and I would recommend it to a friend.  Once I started reading it, it was hard to put down.  I would give it five stars.  Maybe four and three quarters - the ending was not the greatest, a bit predictable, not too exciting. This is a really good book, though, seriously.	2001-08-22

This book is copyright 1972.  I wish Amazon would tell you the year of a book's original publication in its data about a book.  Sometimes you want to read a an  author's work, or (especially) a series, in the order that the books appeared, and with re-issues, Amazon doesn't help you figure the order out... But I digress.  Murder being once done:  Reg Wexford is here, and he's great.  It is hard to believe that this character has been around for so long.  Dora is here, but plays a very minor role, and although the story says that they have been married for many years, there is no mention of their children...  Anyway, this is a well-written police procedural mystery, interesting characters,  lots of plot twists about babies, unwed mothers, and adoption, and an interesting side story about a cult.  You can see a bit of 1972 in the story, but not much - it reads as if it were set in the present time.  It is as good as any Inspector Wexford story, and I was delighted to find it - I keep thinking I have read them all.  If you have read this far into this review, you must be a fan of Ruth Rendell's Inspector Wexford, and I assure you, you will like this book.	2000-12-22

The hero of the story, David, is a well developed and believable character, and it was interesting to read about him.  Lily, on the other hand, plays a major role in the story, and her character is not believable.  Too sensational, lurid - just because a book is aimed at young adults doesn't mean it can be so hokey.  The ending, likewise, is so unbelievable that I kept waiting (in the  final pages) to read that it had not really happened, that it was someone's dream...  no such luck. There is a bit of the ghost or spirit of Lily's sister Kathy in the attic bedroom where  David lives, but this isn't a ghost story; it's a thriller, a suspense novel.  I think that future books by this author will be better. Much of it was very well written, and the characters were well developed.	2000-12-22

It is nice workbook, but it wasn't for us.  It actually says on the cover &quot;For Ages 6 to 8,&quot; but you can't  see that on the Amazon.com cover illustration.<br />  This book is for  children who can add, but who can't really multiply yet.  For example,  there are pictures with four pea pods with five peas in each pod, and the  student determines that 4 x 5 = 20.  It seems to me that this might be good  for a third grader who is a bit behind, that it might be just about right  for a typical second grader, and that it would be good enrichment for first  grader who is a bit ahead.  The workbook questions are easy to understand,  illustrations are attractive and the problems get progressively harder.	1999-08-27

This book helped me understand what to expect and offered some interesting ideas for defending myself.  It demystified the  court process for me and relieved my anxiety quite a bit.<br /> A lot of the  book assumes that the person reading it is ticked off by the arrogance of  the cop who ticketed him and wants to get even.  If this is your case, you  will probably enjoy this book, and you might even be successful in  embarrassing the officer who ticketed you.<br /> There is also some helpful  advice in the beginning of the book about what to say and do if you are  stopped.  I wish I'd had this all in my mind when I was stopped.<br /> I  skimmed four books on defending one's self in traffic court.  As my court  date approached,  I  decoded this one was the most useful of the four and  I read it in detail.  Of course, not everything the author says applies to  every state or every county, but I think the author makes pretty clear what  is part of usual operating procedures and what you may or may not see as  part of courtroom procedures when you are being tried.	1999-07-13

We arrived at 10 a.m. Saturday and left at noon  Monday.  The $75 per person fee included six meals, two nights lodging in a  dorm style lodge room, a lot of horseback riding on lovely trails (they  have over 150 acres of land), canoeing in the little lake, making tie dyed  t shirts, archery, a hay ride, a campfire with s'mores, a night hike, other  nature hikes, and swimming in the pool.
