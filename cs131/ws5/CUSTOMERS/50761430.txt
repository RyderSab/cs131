I think that the CPs are the best band ever. Anthony Kiedis is someone I have always been drawn to and admire as an artist. I admire his lyricism and lifestyle... to a certain extent. This book tends to turn me away from AK as a person simply because he decided to co-author an autobiography that skips out on his spiritual nature, his self as an artist, and the sensitive and understanding part of his nature. Instead, he comes across as a 100% self-centered drug addict, with nothing other than sex on his mind. This book was really cool in the way that it described the origin and the creation of the band, and the trials and tribulations/efforts that went into making it all happen. But when you read the book, you get the sense that Whoever Whatsadilly who helped him write this, weeded-out the philosophical and deep nature of AK, and made it consumable for the average poo bear. I don't know AK. I have never met him. But I feel that through RHCP's songs and his lyrics, there is a whole 'nuther person that I do know, and that was purposefully kept behind the veil.  <br /> <br />I mean, come on... didn't his co-writer also write for Howard Stern, or something??? <br /> <br />Good read for any RHCP fan. <br /> <br />	2004-11-12

This guy is/was very lacking in compassion and love. You read his words and get the same feeling that I associate with someone telling you as a child that there is no Santa Claus. I get it that he's trying to break the conformist in you, but *Example* telling you that parents don't really love their children, they are just scared of what will happen to themselves if something happens to their child, is flat-out freaking rediculous. <br />Krishnamurti picks apart questions asked at the end of every chapter and basically answers the audience's question in the form of another question, hence, creating confusion and indirectness. I think there are many better teachers out there who can lead you in a more positive/productive direction..  Try His Holiness the Dalai Lama or Thich Nhat Hanh.<br />Thanks for playing Krishna-murky.	2003-02-24

Without giving away the plot, etc., I can simply encourage you to wade through the beginning 25 pages or so and then observe Joyce's development as a promising poet and literary architect. There is much skepticism about whether or not the entire account is accurate, but who the heck cares?- or for that matter, who could recollect their entire youth with such vivid detail? This book is well-worth your time to read regardless of your religious affiliation (Joyce was raised an Irish-Roman Catholic) and I would dissuade anyone who might question the book's integrity due to the time and place in which the story occurs- because, as you'll realize, the heart of the content lies in the protagonist's conscious mind.	2003-01-03

I have read Water Dog and Family Dog (and watched the Gun Dog Video) and have found all to be excellent training manuals. What is most interesting to me is that really,  the trainer is the one doing the most learning... the learning comes natural to the dog. So essentially, the books are teaching YOU how to most effectively work with your companion. Most everyone will ask me when I'll take my pup to school... I tell them that I most likely will not have to because Wolters' books (and many other resources) have taught me that training is simply a matter of devotion to the dog. It does take time and effort but no more than that which is necessary (recommended in this book 10-15 minutes a day, gradually increasing time as the pup grows older) to have a disciplined, happy member of the family. Oh yes, and the training done in this book is by Wolters' 6 year old daughter which illustrates his point in just how elementary the training can be.	2002-06-03

Like many Americans and readers who have written reviews of this work, I was also raised in a Christian home. It is easy to see that there is a bridge which most Christians are afraid to cross... that is the bridge to understanding, or more specifically, the way to compassion and understanding of our connection with ALL life and even those people within our own community (Sangha)! The message is that both Christ and the Buddha gathered quite a faithful following (millions strong and counting...) and that following was based upon love, unity and compassion for our fellow man. We should be forever grateful for their teachings. Niether man as he walked the earth was judgemental of others. Jesus and the Buddha befriended prostitutes and monks alike! Their love was for everyone and not biased. They spoke of peace the ease of suffering. They preached how love and compassion can ease the pain that we all encounter just by default of our birth. And when Christ and the Buddha's words were manipulated by those who truly didn't and don't understand them, the message is lost! Thus, we must make every effort in our lives that of which is worthy of the love and deeds performed Christ and the Buddha.	2002-03-28

I also do not wish to disrespect a man who has a following and who is deceased. I bought this book because it was recommended here at Amazon and was said to be similar to the writings of Tom Robbins. Aside from Robbins writing the intro, their being generally from the same era and given their interest in the rebirth of the Goddess (of which Robbins seems to be more intact), there really is a thin association between the two. I would say that Robbins is definitely more enjoyable and enlightening to read and certainly more creative. McKenna's work seems to be quite a bit more technical, scientific and complex. If this is where you're at, you probably will enjoy it! The one thing that I might advise to a potential reader is that if you are looking for a book that will benefit you as a guide to higher consciousness (outside of a mushroom munching or a smokable trip), look elsewhere. In my opinion this book doesn't come close to others that work at constructing the psyche and our general relations to the earth and our fellow man/womankind. It is basically one man's detailed account of tripping without respect to nature or the fact that we are humans existing in a very real, physical world. The fact that shamanism is included in this book could be a little misleading, considering there is more to magic and healing than getting high. Just like MOM used to say... \\"Do you really need to get high to have a good time?\\"	2002-03-18

A great biography of a young man living his life in the mirror of his beliefs. Fueled by the need to become his own man and by works of earthly-existential writers such as Tolstoy and Thoreau (to name a few), McCandless is poetry in motion. I think that what we see is a rare human being with his sights set far beyond where many will dare to explore. Any critical stance against McCandless' decision to live his life in the way in which he chose to live is, in actuality, jealous of an achievement that most fall short of... self-actualization. I would have been proud to known and walked with such a man. My regards to those left behind, but we all must admire the light in which he shed upon not only those who knew him, but those who will read of his life.<br />Peace!	2001-07-30

Without bias and speaking from the heart, His Holiness the Dalai Lama encourages us to shed the skin of bigotry and learned hatred and tap into the core of our compassionate heart.

What I mean to say is that many times you may pick-up a book that boasts the ego of the writer who leads you to believe that he or she may be one of the gifted ones to make contact with the heavens or divinity, leaving the reader to feel as though it may not be attainable to them or this self-understanding only can happen in a work of fiction. After a while, the bragging may get to you and you may find that the author is simply writing for his own gain... or chance at his storytelling. George Marcus seems to have incorporated many different philosophies (Eastern and Western and George Harrison's &quot;within you and without you&quot; , if you will) into Clairadon and what the reader will begin to see is the true nature of self, not excluding the suffering and doubt that arises on any spiritual journey. As we are all human and vulnerable, Clairadon's main character Joshua is you... is me... is a mediator between the content of the story and the reader. The journey that Joshua takes is upon a mystical ship that sails into other lands to discover the connectedness and reality of our actions, beliefs and realizations. My opinion is that Clairadon is a book that you should read at your own pace, absorbing the meaningful content within. This is a journey of humanity, moreover, faith and spirit.	2001-03-05
