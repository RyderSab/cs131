Sayers, Margery Allingham, Agatha Christie and Ngaio Marsh. &quot;Pursuit &amp; Persuasion,&quot; set in the early 1960s, deals thoughtfully with the dangers of obsession and how it can lead us astray. The story opens in Oxford, just outside The Eagle and Child, the pub where C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and the other Inklings used to meet to read and discuss their books. Most of the action takes place in Scotland, and the author's descriptions of that land are vivid and evocative. If you're looking for a contemporary writer who crafts good traditional cozies, Sally S. Wright's well-plotted, deftly characterized tales may be just your cup of tea.	2001-04-25

Wodehouse had been writing novels for young readers during the last quarter of the 20th century, he might have come up with something like &quot;Ordinary Jack,&quot; the first in Helen Cresswell's series The Bagthorpe Saga. Jack, a hopelessly conventional and normal boy stuck in the middle of the madcap, eccentric Bagthorpe family, known for their prodigious achievements, wonders how he can ever get himself noticed. Uncle Parker, not so brilliant himself, sympathizes and comes up with a plan: Jack will become a prophet and go in for such mystical pursuits as visions, water divining, crystal-ball gazing and Tarot-card reading. Of course, all sorts of complications and much hilarity ensue. This very funny book and its six sequels can be found in British paperback editions and ordered from Amazon.co.uk.	2001-04-18

The author, whose descriptive powers are as good as ever, evokes both the oppressive stygian darkness and the wondrous beauty found therein. Whether you're claustrophobic like Anna or not, you'll probably be almost as relieved as she is when the action emerges into the blessed world of daylight. &quot;Blind Descent&quot; is both a suspenseful thriller and a cleverly plotted whodunit, with suspects aplenty and, of course, a few red herrings thrown in for good measure. If you like Nevada Barr's outdoor adventures, you might also enjoy mysteries by B.J. Oliphant, Virginia Lanier and Abigail Padgett.	2001-04-18

Orde's Jason Lynx mysteries. Oliphant and Orde are both pseudonyms of talented SF/fantasy author Sheri S. Tepper. &quot;Dead on Sunday,&quot; set in Santa Fe, New Mexico, involves the killing of an inept, mentally unbalanced, decidedly uncharismatic preacher whose interpretation of certain parts of Scripture is chillingly literal. Well-written and thought-provoking, this series features intelligent, complex and opinionated main characters. And I really liked the delightful animals: the 120-pound Kuvasz dog, Bela; the 20-pound Maine coon cat, Schnitz; and the latter's 30-pound father, Critter.	2000-12-30

He falls down a magic beanstalk (the pole Dorothy rescued him from) and finds himself in a strange land, the Silver Islands, where he is proclaimed to be the re-created Emperor Chang Wang Woe. Meanwhile, when Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion realize that the Scarecrow is missing from the Emerald City, they go off in search of him. In this story, you'll meet many delightful new characters, such as the Doubtful Dromedary, the Comfortable Camel, and (my favorite) Sir Hokus of Pokes. Like Ruth Plumly Thompson's other Oz books, this one is as lively and at least as funny as L. Frank Baum's series. Thompson wrote 19 Oz books, so if you like this one, there are lots more to enjoy.	2000-12-30

You'll find an in-depth entry on just about any fairy tale, old or new, you can think of. Among the profiles of authors, I was pleased to find excellent write-ups on three of my favorites, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and Diana Wynne Jones. Other writers from the past covered here include E. Nesbit, Hans Christian Andersen, Oscar Wilde, A.A. Milne, George MacDonald, Beatrix Potter and L. Frank Baum; others from the present include Robin McKinley, Lloyd Alexander, Vivian Vande Velde, Terry Pratchett, Astrid Lindgren and Patricia C. Wrede.<br />There are also entries on composers, opera, operetta, ballet, illustrators, film, television and science fiction. Generously scattered throughout are full-page (and smaller) illustrations by artists such as Gustav Dore, Kay Nielsen, Walter Crane, W.W. Denslow and Arthur Rackham. And special sections trace in detail the development of fairy tales in various countries.<br />This well-written, well-edited guide is a must for anyone with an interest in fairy tales.	2000-12-26

The story involves a woman who dies suddenly of a mysterious illness, a New Age &quot;crazy lady,&quot; some odd forgetfulness on Shirley's part, greedy relatives who want custody of Allison, witch-hunts, and a psychiatrist who recovers so-called repressed memories of childhood abuse and Satanism. The solution resembles that of a certain Agatha Christie mystery (I won't say which one). If you enjoy a good, entertaining whodunit with intelligent, likable characters and lots of lively conversation, be sure to read this (and the rest of the series). If you like this, you'll probably also like the mysteries written by the same author under the name A.J. Orde.	2000-12-26

The book is generously and charmingly illustrated, too.	2000-12-26

In his quest to get hold of a priceless hidden treasure, he doesn't care how many people he kills. This thriller, one of the best I've ever read, is notable for its graphic contrast of good, personified in the saintly Canon Avril (Albert Campion's uncle), and evil, personified in Havoc. There's also a most entertaining Dickensian cast of cockney characters. &quot;The Tiger in the Smoke&quot; is well worth reading and re-reading.	2000-11-16

This beautiful, oversize, lavishly illustrated Centennial Edition of L. Frank Baum's &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; is a cornucopia of enjoyment for Oz fans. Edited by Oz expert Michael Patrick Hearn, it's annotated in a manner similar to Martin Gardner's &quot;Annotated Alice&quot; (Gardner contributes a preface outlining the history of the &quot;The Annotated Wizard of Oz&quot;).<br />There's a hundred-page introduction, with lots of photos and color illustrations, covering Baum's life, his family, his non-Oz books, and the history of the Oz phenomenon (books, plays, musicals, movies, other Oz authors, and much more).<br />The story itself is reproduced from the 1900 edition. W.W. Denslow's original illustrations, including all 24 color plates, are here too. Hearn's notes are entertaining, informative and very extensive. For example, there are three double-columned pages dealing with Baum's brief one-page introduction alone!<br />Anyone who loves the Oz books will find countless hours of pleasure in this delightful book. It's well worth the price!	2000-10-22

Etta, Coral and Myrtle are three eccentric aunts who dwell on an island where they take care of the creatures who live there, including some very unusual ones: selkies, a boobrie (a sort of cousin of the dodo), mermaids, and a stoorworm (an Icelandic wingless dragon). Since the aunts are getting old, they need some younger people to help out and take over when they're gone, so they decide to kidnap, or &quot;choose,&quot; three children who are unappreciated by their families. As usual with Eva Ibbotson's books, the story is filled with idiosyncratic characters, likable and unlikable (and the latter, of course, are hilariously obnoxious!). There's a kraken who's not at all like the usual sea monster; he's the Soul of the Sea, who patrols the ocean with his Healing Hum, the Song of the Sea. This is one of Ms. Ibbotson's best (and they're all very good!). Note: This was originally published in the U.K. under the title &quot;Monster Mission.&quot;	2000-10-21

Chesterton's ingenious, thoughtful and lyrically written mystery short stories featuring the unassuming little priest who solves crimes by imagining himself inside the mind and soul of the criminal and understanding his motives. The stories are full of paradox, spiritual insight, and &quot;Chestertonian fantasy,&quot; or seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary.<br />This particular edition is enhanced by Martin Gardner's extensive notes, which are both entertaining and illuminating. He points out that it's worthwhile to take your time in reading GKC's stories so you can savor their many arresting, beautifully worded sentences. And by reading too fast, you might also miss out on some very subtle puns (there's one in the story &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; that would have gone right past me had not Mr. Gardner pointed it out!).<br />At the end, you'll find an index of annotations, plus a comprehensive Father Brown bibliography compiled by Chesterton expert John Peterson. If you enjoy this book, you'll probably also like &quot;The Annotated Thursday,&quot; Gardner's edition of GKC's &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday.&quot;	2000-10-21

Shirley McClintock, friend J.Q. and foster daughter Allison are staying at a guest ranch in northern New Mexico. Of course, wherever Shirley is, things happen: a shooting that leaves the unpleasant daughter of a shady Middle Eastern businessman dead and Shirley hospitalized (she gets a new knee!); the kidnapping of a rich family's newborn son; the murder of a Pueblo woman; and the discovery of some valuable Indian pottery. As a onetime New Mexican, I really enjoyed the vivid evocation of the Land of Enchantment and its mix of cultures. Like all of B.J. Oliphant's mysteries, this one features intelligent, appealing characters and plenty of the sort of dialogue that makes you think.	2000-09-28

I happened to read the second book (&quot;Who Killed Dorian Gray?&quot;) before this one, and it contained many spoilers for the first, including the murderer's identity. No problem, though: I had great fun watching for the clues and red herrings. Of course, I spotted them easily, but it would have been much more difficult had I not already known who the villain was. In any case, it's a delightful whodunit with three intelligent detectives: the thoughtful mystery editor Claire Rawlings; the alarmingly precocious 13-year-old Meredith Lawrence, whose role model is Sherlock Holmes; and the affable, attractive police detective Wallace Jackson, a widower and former schoolteacher. Running through the story as a sort of background theme is Goethe's poem (and Schubert's song) &quot;The Erl King.&quot;	2000-09-20

Suddenly, he is transported back in  time to 1599 London and finds himself portraying Puck at the original  Globe. Not only that, he's performing with Will Shakespeare himself, who is  playing Oberon! The author brings the sights, sounds and smells of  Elizabethan London to life and takes us behind the scenes of the Bard's own  production of &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; After reading this,  you'll probably want to read the play and see a performance yourself. Susan  Cooper, who was a student of J.R.R. Tolkien, is an outstanding writer and  storyteller. Don't miss her magnum opus, the five-book &quot;The Dark Is  Rising&quot; series.	2000-09-18

If you enjoy  a literate, intelligent traditional (but quirky) British whodunit, this  should be just your cup of tea.

The witches, who are competing in a  contest of sinister deeds to marry the wizard Arriman the Awful, include  one who is half mermaid, a pair of quarrelsome twins who have chickens for  familiars, a truly evil enchantress, and Belladonna, a good witch who seems  unable to do anything wicked no matter how hard she tries. If you liked  &quot;The Secret of Platform 13,&quot; you'll like this one too. I also  recommend Ms. Ibbotson's &quot;Island of the Aunts&quot; (British title:  &quot;Monster Mission&quot;), plus her ghost books, available in U.K.  editions.	2000-09-10

No  doubt there are Catholics who believe in reincarnation, the healing power  of crystals, trance channeling, spirit guides and other New Age nonsense.  Unicorns have nothing to do with this, however. The unicorn is barely  mentioned in the main text of &quot;The Unicorn in the Sanctuary.&quot; The  cover features a ghastly demon unicorn. The brief prologue asserts that the  mythical beast is an evil New Age symbol of destruction that has wrongly  been associated with Christ.<br />There is no &quot;wrongly&quot; about it.  Catholic writer Sandra Miesel, in an article for the impeccably orthodox  This Rock magazine (&quot;The Unicorn Hunters,&quot; August 1991), points  out that church fathers Tertullian, Ambrose, Jerome and Basil called the  unicorn a symbol of Christ and that it appeared widely in medieval art as a  symbol of the Incarnation. The unicorn also came to symbolize chaste love  and faithful marriage. And remember Jewel, the noble unicorn in C.S. Lewis'  &quot;Chronicles of Narnia.&quot;<br />As if misrepresentation of the unicorn  weren't enough, the book as a whole is poorly researched and misleading.  The text, footnotes and bibliography indicate that the author has relied  heavily on the sensationalistic, anti-Catholic &quot;cult expert&quot; Dave  Hunt. He also cites as a reference Texe Marrs, an evangelist who has  alleged that all New Agers are part of a conscious, Satan-directed  conspiracy to exterminate Christians by 2004; that C.S. Lewis' fiction is  &quot;New Age&quot;; and that J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the  Rings&quot; is &quot;demonically energized.&quot; Yikes! All this is  obviously fringe fundamentalist, not Catholic.<br />If you enjoy absurdity,  you may find the book amusing. But please don't take it seriously. It's a  fount of misinformation.	2000-09-07

He's killed the trees, poisoned the water,  built sheds with glaring tin roofs, and driven away the wildlife. And he  runs a screaming scrub-clearing machine all day seven days a week. Of  course, there's no shortage of suspects. Shirley is as outspoken as ever,  and she voices plenty of opinions to unsettle liberals and conservatives  both. B.J. Oliphant is a pseudonym of SF/fantasy author Sheri S. Tepper.  This whole series is very entertaining, and so is her other series of  whodunits, written under the name A.J. Orde.	2000-09-07

Before long, the oddest and most  unpleasant crew member is found dead in the water. This book might be just  your cup of tea if you enjoy a leisurely-paced cozy with idiosyncratic  characters and plenty of literary references: John Buchan's Richard Hannay,  hero of the classic thriller &quot;The 39 Steps,&quot; holds the key to  solving the mystery.

A brother and sister from the city take the train to visit their country  cousin. The children discover an old, mostly abandoned summer colony of  houses near a swamp that used to be a lake. There they meet the most  charming people in the book, an elderly sister and brother, Minnehaha  Cheever and Pindar Payton, who are living happily in the place where they  spent summers as children. The pair wear old-fashioned clothes stored away  many years ago by their family, cultivate a variety of gardens, and have  chickens, goats, a duck, and a cat named Fatly. Once a month, Pindar cranks  up the antique Franklin car and drives into town for supplies. The children  are adventuresome and imaginative, and have no need of TV to keep  themselves amused. The descriptions of the country are amazingly vivid, and  there's plenty of humor too. Don't miss the sequel, &quot;Return to  Gone-Away.&quot; And Elizabeth Enright's series about the Melendy family is  also fun to read.	2000-08-21

They are pursued by the Morrigan's menacing but  inept hounds and aided by a charming, and quite comical, assortment of  talking animals: the frog Puddeneen, an earwig who helps the children  escape the evil goddess' illusory castle, a delightful spider family, a fox  called Cooroo, and more. Also assisting Pidge and Brigit are such mythical  figures as Cuchulain, Queen Maeve, the druid Cathbad, and Brigit (goddess  of the hearth) and Angus Og (god of love). &quot;The Hounds of the  Morrigan&quot; is an enchanting story that celebrates the goodness of  creation and makes the reader see magic and miraculousness in the ordinary,  everyday world.	2000-08-19

It's not all bad, though. The plot is clever enough, and the dogs  are well-portrayed: Dash and Magritte are by far the most likable  characters in the book and actually made it worth reading. I also enjoyed  the inside look at the Westminster dog show. If you like both truly  hard-boiled detective fiction and canines, you'll probably find this a good  read.	2000-08-19

Her gardener, Bob Finch, is suspected  of having stolen a toy tea set from the local dollhouse museum at  Brocklesby Hall, a grotesque country house owned by the eccentric, elflike  Sir Mordred. In her quest to exonerate Bob, Dorothy spends time at the  museum investigating and, in the process, learns much about miniatures and  the little houses in which they are displayed. Two murders ensue, and  Dorothy, of course, decides to find out who the culprit is. The story's big  surprise revelation is easy to foresee, but the book is so charmingly  written and has so many endearing characters that it doesn't matter at all.  For maximum enjoyment, read the series in order, beginning with &quot;The  Body in the Transept,&quot; so you can get to know the people (and cats) in  this delightful series.	2000-08-19

As always, Nevada Barr, a former park ranger, delivers wonderfully vivid descriptions of the great outdoors; an abundance of colorful, well-drawn  characters; a thoughtful and courageous female sleuth; an inside look at  the National Park Service; and an intricate and suspenseful mystery.  However, the most mysterious thing about &quot;Endangered Species,&quot;  set on an island off the coast of Georgia and involving the investigation  of a plane crash caused by sabotage, is that the paperback has been  extensively revised from the hardcover. Namely, a major character, an  exceedingly unpleasant, repulsive person, has undergone a sex change! In  the hardcover, Marty is a woman in her 50s; in the paperback, Marty is a  man in his 30s. It's not just a matter of changing pronouns; dialogue and  descriptions are altered too. For example, in the original version, Marty's  long hair is &quot;worn in pigtails like an aging Pippi  Longstocking's&quot;; in the revision, it's &quot;worn in pigtails like  Willie Nelson in his heyday.&quot; There must have been a compelling reason  for such changes, since ordinarily paperback publishers don't even bother  to fix obvious errors, such as referring to someone by the wrong name. I  think the character works somewhat better as a woman, but whichever version  you read, you'll likely find it a good, absorbing, entertaining whodunit.	2000-08-13

The kingdom's prince was kidnapped as an infant during a visit  to London. Nine years later, when the portal between worlds reopens, four  rescuers -- Cornelius, an elderly wizard who used to be a university  professor in our world; Odge, a young and remarkably unhaglike hag;  Gurkintrude, a fey who is sort of a goddess of agricultural plenty; and  Hans, a kindly one-eyed ogre from the Alps who yodels and tends goats --  are sent by the king and queen to bring him home. The story is full of  eccentric characters, mostly likable, a few definitely not: sundry ghosts  who help the rescuers; Melisande, a water nymph who wants it known that she  has feet and is not a mermaid; the hilariously obnoxious Mrs. Trottle and  her equally unpleasant son; some horrifically amusing and ghastly harpies  who have permanent waves and carry handbags; and Ben, a delightful kitchen  boy of unknown parentage. The whole thing is very humorous, lively and  imaginative, and fans of Diana Wynne Jones and J.K. Rowling most likely  will enjoy it immensely. Also well worth reading are Ms. Ibbotson's  extremely funny ghost books, obtainable in British paperback editions.	2000-08-13

Aleut investigator Kate Shugak goes undercover working on the pipeline for  an oil company to find out who's supplying cocaine to its employees. I  could have done with a little less detail on the processes involved in oil  extraction, but there's a lot to enjoy here. Much of Kate's first day at  the base camp is quite funny, and there are enough colorful, eccentric  people to satisfy anyone. I enjoyed the interlude in Anchorage with Kate  and her wolf-Siberian husky mix, Mutt, one of those dogs you find in  mysteries who obviously have more sense than some of the human characters.  The identity of one of the drug dealers really surprised me. Not only is  this a good, entertaining story; it's also true to life in showing, as Kate  points out, how drugs can make smart people stupid and greedy.	2000-08-13

And her waspish, vindictive  personal assistant, Naomi Matthews, is even worse. After someone downs a  fatal Pellegrino with lime, and a couple of abductions at gunpoint ensue,  Liz, who is a prime suspect, must find out who doctored the drink. Though  two of the major characters are exceedingly unpleasant, there are plenty of  more appealing ones, not the least of which is Liz herself, a likable,  sympathetic amateur detective. On the whole, this whodunit is funny,  sometimes outlandish, and very entertaining. This is the first of Lora  Roberts' mysteries I've read, and I now plan on reading the first four  books of the series.	2000-08-10

Headed by former Met diva  Anna Varovna (whose frequent malapropisms are quite amusing), the colony is  located in an idyllic wooded area of East Hampton. But as the opera company  prepares for a production of &quot;Cosi fan tutte,&quot; there's trouble in  paradise: Phoebe senses an atmosphere of unease among the group. And the  affable, Valentinoesque baritone, Frank Palermo, a young man given to  sudden enthusiasms, has become involved in the Children of Truth, a cult  that believes in total candor no matter what the consequences, the theory  being that doing away with all secrets will bring about world love and  peace. After Frank, who has made no secret of his severe allergy to  penicillin, is found dead of anaphylactic shock, Phoebe sets out to  discover who has a secret worth killing for. The author has cleverly  inserted a number of red herrings to lead the reader astray, but if you're  alert, you can spot the real clues. Deft plotting, humor, eccentric and  lifelike characters, well-written dialogue, and plenty of opera lore all  combine to make this a very enjoyable cozy, especially for opera fans. I  hope Ms. Sturges has a sequel on the way.	2000-08-10

Sally, it turns out, is his  beloved tabby cat. Arbuthnot is found dead in his office, and his will  leaves the lion's share of his estate to Sally. (No wonder, since she's far  and away the most pleasant member of the family!) Fearing for the feline  heiress' safety, Annabel kidnaps her and takes her home with her.  Complications ensue: There's another suspicious death, and numerous  impostor tabby cats enter the picture. Like all of Marian Babson's cat  mysteries, &quot;The Company of Cats&quot; is a light, witty, amusing story  that feline fanciers who like cozy mysteries will enjoy.	2000-08-10

First she's called on to help Cassandra and Paul with Suds,  the Siberian husky they're fostering, and her pups. Then divorcing couple  Edith and Trevor want her to mediate in a custody dispute over their silky  terrier, Shogun. Allie subsequently finds Cassandra murdered in Edith's  back yard, and Shogun is nowhere to be found. &quot;Ruff Way to Go,&quot;  like &quot;Play Dead,&quot; its predecessor, is an entertaining cozy  whodunit that dog lovers will enjoy. The series should appeal especially to  those who like Susan Conant's mysteries: Allie's world-view is as  dog-centered as Holly Winter's; humor, though more low-key, is much in  evidence; and there's an abundance of canine lore, including lots of useful  care and training tips.	2000-08-10

And you'll meet new ones, such as Rita Skeeter, Mad-Eye Moody, Winky  the house-elf and Victor Krum. This is very good fantasy, the sort that  makes you see the magic in everyday life. I've noticed that more and more  grown-ups are reading this series, which is definitely not for children  only. While you're waiting for Harry Potter 5, you might enjoy reading  fantasies by two outstanding British authors, Diana Wynne Jones and Eva  Ibbotson (look for the latter's ghost books in U.K. editions).	2000-08-09

This mystery is great fun  for book lovers. It's replete with eccentric bibliophiles, various  libraries, and antiquarian bookstores.

Though he has heard there are wolves and outlaws in Sherwood Forest, it's the only place he can hide. Delirious with fever, he stumbles into a cave,  part of Robin Hood's tiny &quot;kingdom,&quot; hidden by a dense thicket  and protected by Our Lady of the Forest. At first, Robin and, especially,  Marian are afraid that Dummy might be a spy for the wicked Prince John, but  soon he is accepted by the green-clad outlaws. It's Marian who teaches him  to use a bow and arrow, because she's the best archer. Robin becomes  Dummy's hero, and the boy hopes, one day, to be just like him. This is an  inspiring story of faith, honor, courage and friendship. The descriptions  of the greenwood are lovely, and the characters come alive. There are many  exciting, often humorous, adventures. And there's a delightful surprise  happy ending. Although &quot;Robin's Country&quot; is written primarily for  young readers, I think anyone interested in Robin Hood would enjoy it. Some  other good books based on the Robin Hood legend are Theresa Tomlinson's  &quot;The Forestwife&quot; and &quot;Child of the May&quot; and Robin  McKinley's &quot;The Outlaws of Sherwood.&quot;	2000-06-29

Our sleuths are the opera-loving Jesuit priest Father John O'Malley, sent to  the remote St. Francis Mission several years ago after a fall into  alcoholism, and his friend Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden, divorced and  known to her people as Woman Alone. Both are well portrayed, flawed just  enough to be human and likable. The story involves the murder of the  mission's 72-year-old assistant priest, who has recently returned to the  reservation after a 35-year absence; the search for her biological parents  by a movie actress who thinks she was born to Arapahos; an unexpected visit  from Father John's architect niece, who is troubled about her parentage;  and some dark secrets from the past. I think fans of Tony Hillerman are  likely to enjoy this series. There's less mysticism here, but these  mysteries are steeped in Arapaho culture. Ms. Coel is a historian of the  American West, and her novels are well researched. Most important, she  knows how to write a good, suspenseful whodunit.	2000-06-28

Something has gone wrong with the enchantment that keeps the people of Oz from aging. To  find its source, Ozma, carried by a Parrot-Ox named Tempus, travels back  through time and alternate Lands of Oz (the Ozziverse) in search of The Man  Who Lives Backwards. She meets alternate versions of several of her  friends: The Wizard is an evil, tyrannical ruler; Nick Chopper is a  menacing, heartless soldier who wields an ax; Omby Amby becomes Wantowin  Battles. She even meets alternate Ozmas. The book is lavishly and  delightfully illustrated by Eric Shanower, with drawings that turn  intriguingly Escheresque in the Absurd City chapters (and in the  endpapers). All in all, it's a beautifully produced volume that will give  Oz aficionados great pleasure. Don't worry if you don't understand all the  twisting logic (I don't think I did); it's still great fun. And if you like  this book, don't miss Martin Gardner's &quot;Visitors From Oz,&quot;  another intelligent and humorous addition to the Oz canon.	2000-06-27

The people are vividly portrayed, especially our heroine, Jo Beth Sidden, a &quot;staunch but not militant feminist&quot; and Georgia good  ol' girl. The descriptions, particularly of the perilous treks through the  Okefenokee Swamp, capture the imagination and transport you directly to the  Deep South. The bloodhounds come to life too: These dogs are real, not mere  background props. The bloodhound lore -- history, training, how these  amazing animals do their tracking, their gentle and affectionate  disposition -- is fascinating. And cat fanciers will be delighted to find a  feline among all the canines. There's a good chance fans of Sue Grafton,  Margaret Maron, Sara Paretsky, Susan Conant, B.J. Oliphant/A.J.

She takes the dog with her when she drives out to  UFO capital Roswell, New Mexico, to help her aunt, who's having foot  surgery. Aunt Hortense and Uncle Ira belong to the ufologist Neighborhood  Church of the Celestial Spheres. After the philandering assistant pastor is  murdered, Uncle Ira is the prime suspect (once Claudius has been  exonerated), so Annie must find out who the real killer is. &quot;Wolf at  the Door&quot; is a light, humorous, entertaining cozy mystery, with rather  outlandish characters, and would easily rate 4 stars if it weren't for the  fact that Annie twice leaves Claudius in her locked car on a summer day  while she attends a funeral. That's hazardous to the dog, even in a shady  spot with the front windows partly open. So enjoy the mystery, but don't  follow Annie's example when it comes to dog care. Maybe by the time the  promised sequel, &quot;Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,&quot; comes out, she will  have done some reading up on the subject. I hope so, because this could be  a very enjoyable series.	2000-06-19

As if that weren't enough, the  island is hit by an extremely violent storm. This is a wonderful series,  with a charming sleuth and many likable characters.

This tale centers around Lavan, the 16-year-old son of a cloth merchant and  a needleworker, who is sent by his parents to what proves to be the  school-from-hell. It's dominated by a gang of vicious, sadistic bullies,  and it's where Lavan's rare and dangerous Gift manifests itself. We meet  many well-portrayed, likable characters: young Owyn, Lavan's ally against  the school thugs; Herald Pol, Lavan's mentor; Herald Trainee Tuck and his  delightful family; King Theran; the Companion Kalira. If you enjoyed the  stories of Vanyel and Talia, you'll probably like the story of Lavan  Firestorm too.	2000-06-14

This novel has the distinction of featuring the scariest,  most chilling villain of the series: an emotionless, psychopathic,  methodical killer for hire who leaves nothing to chance. The suspense  builds as the point of view alternates between the killer's and Navajo  policeman Jim Chee's. &quot;People of Darkness&quot; is one of the best in  a literate and very entertaining Southwestern series. For other  well-written American Indian-related mysteries, try James D. Doss' Shaman  series and Margaret Coel's Arapaho series.	2000-06-14

It's even better! The second book in the Protector of the Small series, &quot;Page&quot; covers Keladry's last three years as a page in knighthood-training school. We meet several new characters: Lalasa, Kel's maid, whom Kel hires in order to protect her from ill treatment by others; Owen, the young page whose favorite word is &quot;jolly&quot;; and a new animal friend (in addition to Kel's cranky yet loyal horse, Peachblossom, and her helpful flock of sparrows), the faithful dog Jump. Kel continues to stand up to bullies and works to conquer her fear of heights. Her mysterious benefactor bestows more gifts on her. Keladry of Mindelan is an admirable and likable heroine, and in this book she shows her courage, resourcefulness and leadership ability. If you haven't read the two previous Tortallan series, The Song of the Lioness Quartet and The Immortals, don't delay! These are all well-written, exciting, fun fantasies that can be enjoyed by both young readers and grown-ups.	2000-06-13

One of the  members is found dead in a locked-room situation on a houseboat called the  Mrs. Hudson. And somebody has carried off a major heist after sending a  cryptic riddle message to the news media challenging the police to stop the  crime. Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond, who has been yearning for a  puzzling case to work on, has reason to believe the murder and the theft  are related. &quot;Bloodhounds&quot; is replete with playful references and  allusions to a wide range of detective fiction. It's a very well-written  and cleverly plotted mystery, with lots of interesting characters, that  will appeal to readers who like traditional whodunits. And for John Dickson  Carr fans, it's one that definitely should not be missed.	2000-06-12

After she rescues some kittens from a spidren monster, she becomes more determined than ever to go to knighthood-training school, so she can learn how to protect the weak and small. Kel is the first girl page since  Alanna (who was disguised as a boy at the time), and the odds seem to be  against her: The training master thinks girls shouldn't be knights; some of  the boys play vicious practical jokes on her, trying to get her to drop  out. Kel shows her courage when she is the first student to stand up to the  school bullies. As always in Tamora Pierce's fantasies, there are plenty of  good, likable characters, such as the Shang Wildcat, Daine (who converses  with animals), King Jonathan, the mage Numair, good old Sir Myles, Neal of  Queenscove, and Lord Raoul. And then there are the animals: Kel's faithful  horse, Peachblossom, and the sparrow Crown and her flock, who prove quite  dangerous to Kel's enemies. There are some exciting confrontations with  immortal monsters. &quot;First Test&quot; is the first book in Ms. Pierce's  third Tortallan series, Protector of the Small, and it's just as much fun  as the two earlier series. I'm now looking forward to reading the next  book, &quot;Page.&quot;	2000-05-31

I found it to be every bit as good as &quot;Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Outlaws of Sherwood.&quot; The heroine is not your traditional sort of princess. Cursed on her name-day by  the wicked fairy Pernicia, she is carried off by the apprentice fairy  Katriona and brought up in a remote area of the country as an ordinary  village girl called Rosie. She is strong-willed and intelligent, cuts her  hair short, wears trousers, and becomes a horse doctor after apprenticing  herself to the smith Narl. Rosie has the gift of beast-speech, or the  ability to communicate with animals. And Robin McKinley certainly has a  gift for the portrayal of animals (my favorite is Flinx the cat); she seems  to know exactly what the various birds and beasts would say if they could  talk. Rosie has a great many animal friends -- cats, dogs, foxes, bears,  robins, horses, cows, otters, badgers, et al. -- who play a very important  part in the story. The happy ending involving the kiss is, well, not quite  the same as the traditional one. Read &quot;Spindle's End,&quot; enjoy an  enchanting story, and find out what happens. This is fairy-tale fantasy at  its best.	2000-05-30

It focuses on  Christian converts, mostly Catholic and some Anglican, among them Oscar  Wilde, G.K. Chesterton (who seems to have influenced almost all of the  others), Evelyn Waugh, T.S. Eliot, C.S. Lewis, Edith Sitwell, Graham  Greene, Muriel Spark, E.F. Schumacher, Alec Guinness and Malcolm  Muggeridge. There's also the occasional cradle Catholic (Hilaire Belloc),  childhood convert (J.R.R. Tolkien) or cradle Anglican (Dorothy L. Sayers),  along with non-Christians such as H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw, all  of whose lives intersected with and influenced those of the converts.  Joseph Pearce's writing is clear, pleasant and literate, making this an  irresistible read for Catholics and other Christians, especially those who  are also Anglophiles. If you enjoy this book, you might also want to read  Mr. Pearce's biographies of Tolkien and Chesterton.	2000-05-25

There's a lot going on in Pickax, Moose County, 400 miles from everywhere: the opening of the newly  refurbished town hotel; the Scottish Gathering; a visit by an eccentric  estate jewelry dealer named Delacamp; the planned first annual Mark Twain  Festival. The mystery begins when Delacamp is found murdered in his room at  the hotel. Was the perpetrator a local or someone from Down Below? What is  the significance of Koko's &quot;conceptual art&quot;? Where is the jewelry  dealer's missing &quot;niece&quot;? Why are Koko and Yum Yum stealing  pennies? Why does Koko want Qwilleran to read &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;?  Never fear: Qwill and his cats will give us the answers. In addition to the  mystery itself, you'll find interesting asides on the Arts &amp; Crafts  movement, workaholic sheep-herding Border collies, Scottish games, and  Anthony Trollope's mother. Don't let snobbish putdowns of cat cozies keep  you from reading and enjoying this series. Lilian Jackson Braun always  gives us a good, gently humorous story with a pleasant ambience and plenty  of likable characters, feline and human.	2000-05-23

Chesterton on the Arts	Books	5	19	20	N	Y	An excellent overview of GKC on the arts	Thomas Peters does an excellent job of presenting G.K. Chesterton's thoughts and observations on imagination and the arts. This book is a wonderful and much needed antidote to today's cultural climate, in which  the arts establishment seems to value ugliness and outrageousness above  all. Here are a few of GKC's countercultural opinions: Fashionable nihilism  and pessimism are among the greatest threats to the free and fruitful  imagination; humility and wonder enhance creativity, while pride inhibits  it; good poetry has rhyme and rhythm; there's nothing wrong with beauty in  art; a play should be a treat for the audience, not a realistic  slice-of-life; it is not a legitimate use of the arts to make people either  bad or unhappy; the &quot;higher frivolity&quot; is better than the  &quot;higher criticism&quot; and other pretensions. You'll find all this  and more in this well-written book, which includes many quotations (and a  few drawings) from GKC himself. And it's all at least as relevant today as  it was in Chesterton's time.	2000-05-18

Holly Winter and her Alaskan malamute Rowdy, who has qualified as a therapy  dog, visit the Gateway nursing home, where they meet a 90-year-old woman,  Althea, and her friends, Robert and Hugh, all of whom are Sherlockians.  Althea's sister, Ceci, is being conned by a woman who calls herself an  &quot;animal communicator&quot; and who claims to be channeling messages  from Ceci's dear departed Newfoundland, Lord Saint Simon. Then Ceci and  Althea's grandnephew, Jonathan, is found murdered in Ceci's back yard.  Holly and her Sherlockian friends set out to discover whodunit. In addition  to the usual dog lore, this book is chock-full of references and allusions  to the Sherlock Holmes Canon: Ceci lives on a gaslit street on Norwood  Hill; the tall, evil man whom Holly thwarts in his attempt to drown a cat  has a &quot;bulbous forehead&quot;; an obnoxious couple on the dog-show  circuit are named Gloria and Scott. (Holmesians will notice one gaffe: Take  a look at Holly's account of the plot of &quot;The Copper Beeches&quot; in  Chapter 26. Oh well, she has admitted that she's no expert.) If you enjoy a  good, humorous cozy mystery, and if you are a dog lover and/or a Sherlock  Holmes devotee, you're likely to find this book lots of fun.	2000-05-17

Anne McCaffrey's son Todd has given us a pleasant, entertaining book about his mother, the people and animals in her life, and her writing. There are many photos scattered throughout. Don't expect a detailed, chronological  biography or extensive coverage of her books. Here's what you can read  about here: her dogs (Wizard, Merlin, Angelo), cats (Thomas-cat, Maxwell  Smart, Isaac Asimov), and horse (Mr. Ed). There's a delightful account of  an unlikely friendship between Mr. Ed and a cat named Zeke. Other  highlights include Anne's early acting and singing career; her culinary  talents; how life experiences influenced her books; her family heritage of  &quot;second sight&quot;; the world of SF writers, editors and conventions;  her move from the U.S. to Ireland in 1970; and the success of her dragon  series. Toward the end of the book, Anne acquires her County Wicklow home,  which she would name Dragonhold because her dragons had bought it for her.	2000-05-10

The shaman is Daisy Perika, an aged Ute woman who lives in a trailer near a sacred canyon. The mystery involves  ritual-sacrifice slayings, spilling first animal, then human, blood, and a  controversy over the possible disposal of nuclear waste in the sacred  canyon. As befits the title, this book is lightened by humorous episodes  amid the grim goings-on. Characters include a nervous, prickly FBI special  agent named J.E. Hoover; the shaman's malapropistic cousin Gorman; a  crooked insurance man with political ambitions; an unfortunate Belgian poet  and would-be Indian mystic; the pitikupf, a sort of Ute leprechaun who  lives in the sacred canyon; and a collector of antiquities and data who  says the ritual killer is an elusive individual he calls &quot;Cain.&quot;  Who is this devilish Cain? It's up to policemen Scott Parris and Charlie  Moon to find out. I thought this book didn't quite measure up to the  outstanding &quot;The Shaman Sings&quot; (a hard act to follow), but it's  still a good, entertaining read, and I definitely plan to continue on with  the series.	2000-05-08

The mystery centers around a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Dolphin Theatre in London. Most of those involved in the play are  superstitious to varying degrees about the bad-luck curse traditionally  associated with &quot;Macbeth.&quot; Even to say the play's name is  considered dangerous, so it's referred to as &quot;the Scots play.&quot;  During rehearsals someone starts playing gruesome practical jokes. And  somebody is sending out anonymous messages about a likable and talented  child actor whose father is the Hampstead Chopper, a notorious serial  killer confined in the Broadmoor asylum. One night, during a performance  attended by Chief Superintendent Roderick Alleyn, a grisly murder involving  a ceremonial sword occurs just before the final curtain. If you like  traditional British cozies with mostly pleasant characters, you'll probably  enjoy this mystery, and if you're also a Shakespeare aficionado, you'll  enjoy it even more.	2000-05-08

In this book, denizens of Oz (Dorothy, the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow) come to our world via a Klein Bottle. It's unlike any previous Oz book. In it we find the Internet, the gods of Mount Olympus (Apollo &quot;used to take the sun  around the earth, but he had to stop doing this when astronomers proved  that the earth went around the sun&quot;), characters from Alice's  Wonderland and Looking-Glass Land, and the bear detective Sheerluck Brown.

Eccentric characters include  the amateur detective, Oxford English professor Gervase Fen; a rustic  innkeeper; a ponderously Johnsonian carpenter/lay preacher and his  obsequious assistant; and an elderly bloodhound mix, Mr. Merrythought, an  unlikely hero who saves the day. Well written, with a light touch,  &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; is full of literary allusions and plenty of  humor.

This enormous volume contains the words to all the  G&amp;S operas, plus extensive notes explaining allusions and words that  might be unfamiliar to today's listener. Asimov assumes minimal knowledge  on the part of the reader, so this book is useful and entertaining not only  for the veteran G&amp;S aficionado but also for the neophyte.	2000-04-24

Apparently inspired by Tony Hillerman (there's a direct reference to his  books), Mr. Doss is no mere imitator; he has his own original approach. He  skillfully shifts point of view among a diverse array of characters: the  town police chief, the aged Indian woman who is the shaman of the title, a  psychopathic maintenance man on the lam, a British expatriate recluse who  was a cipher expert during WWII, and various members of the physics  department at the local university.  And he lets us into the mind of the  madman killer, who at first could be any one of a number of characters.  Gradually the possibilities are narrowed down until at last, thanks to the  shaman, we find out whodunit. I'm very much looking forward to reading the  rest of this series.	2000-04-13

The only thing that mars the series is the ugly  language employed whenever Decker gets together with his LAPD colleagues. I  guess this is in there because it's &quot;realistic,&quot; but I for one  don't need such realism in my recreational reading. (I've found it's  possible to skim over most of this dialogue without losing track of the  story.) &quot;Day of Atonement&quot; is my favorite of the series so far.  Not only is it a compelling story involving the search for a teenage boy  who runs away from his Orthodox community in New York; much of the action  takes place away from Los Angeles and thus we are largely spared the  unpleasant conversations of the cops.	2000-04-13

Chesterton will enjoy this witty and entertaining mystery. It centers around the discovery at Notre Dame of an unpublished Father Brown story. The book is full of references to GKC, and the professor-detective  Roger Knight is an unusual and likable character. The first two books in  this series are also worth reading.	2000-04-05

Inspector Luke Thanet uncovers the shocking incident in her childhood  that ultimately led to her death. Dorothy Simpson not only gives us an  excellent British police procedural, but also illustrates how extreme  parental repressiveness can push a child toward a life of deceitfulness.  One of the best of the series.	2000-04-04

They feature controversial issues of the day and  lots of eccentric characters. &quot;Baptism in Blood&quot; features a  lesbian camp just outside a small Southern town, an atheist bookseller, and  some fundamentalists who are convinced that the camp harbors Satanists who  have been performing ritual sacrifices. In contrast to all this  eccentricity is former FBI agent Demarkian, known as &quot;the  Armenian-American Hercule Poirot,&quot; ordinary and sensible, a bastion of  sanity in the mad world that surrounds him. This is a very entertaining  mystery, and the whole series is well worth reading.	2000-04-04

That's one reason I enjoyed this mystery; another is the (mostly) likable characters. It's easy to  figure out whodunit, but it's all very entertaining nonetheless. I hope  there will be more in this series. If you'd like to read another book,  British in this case, about mystery readers getting involved in a murder, I  highly recommend the very well-written &quot;Bloodhounds&quot; by Peter  Lovesey.	2000-04-03
US	52592182	RSVDRIQJ3WLKN	0345388011	848996193	Call No Man Father	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Exciting and thought-provoking	&quot;Call No Man Father&quot; is one of the very best of Mr. Kienzle's mysteries. I've read it three times so far. Once you've read the first chapter, in which a priest is murdered at Dublin Airport so that the killer  can assume his identity, you won't want to stop. In addition to giving us a  good story, Mr. Kienzle explores the issues of papal infallibility and  birth control. There is a bias toward liberal Catholicism, but whatever  your religious, or nonreligious, persuasion, you'll find this to be an  exciting and thought-provoking novel.	2000-03-30

It's my favorite of the Terry Pratchett books I've read so far. Fundamentalists won't like it, but anyone who is at all open-minded will  enjoy this intelligent, satirical fantasy.	2000-03-30
US	52592182	RZTBYMVV65781	0449146537	478108221	Dead in the Scrub	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Opinionated and entertaining	&quot;Dead in the Scrub&quot; is the first book in B.J. Oliphant's Shirley McClintock series. I have read it four times. Since Oliphant is really Sheri S. Tepper, it's not surprising that her main character is quite  opinionated, and didactic at times. This doesn't detract from the story,  though. In fact, it may add to its appeal. Whether you agree with Shirley's  opinions or not, she's never boring. The conversations and characters are  as entertaining as the mystery itself. One of the most likable characters  is an 11-year-old girl, Alison, whose mother is forcing her into an  extreme, grotesque caricature of grown-up femininity, complete with full  makeup and artificial nails, when the girl would rather be reading or  playing baseball. After Alison's parents are murdered, she goes to live  with Shirley and her friend J.Q. on their ranch, where she can lead a freer  and more normal life. (You'd almost think that Shirley, upon seeing the way  the poor girl is being brought up, might be tempted to do away with the  parents herself, but, don't worry, she's not the one whodunit.) All the  books in this series are well worth reading. And I also recommend Ms.  Tepper's other mystery series, written under the name A.J. Orde.	2000-03-30

Readers who like English-cozy mysteries, especially those with a Church of England setting,  will find much to enjoy here. There is never a dull moment, with continual  goings-on involving the High Church vs. Low Church controversy,  animal-rights activists, lots of interesting and likable characters, and a  very unlikable murder victim.	2000-03-29

Chesterton will especially enjoy. The story revolves around the discovery at Notre Dame University of an unpublished Father Brown story. References to Chesterton abound, and  there's lots of GKC trivia that will appeal to Chestertonians. All this,  combined with Ralph McInerny's usual satirical wit, makes for very  entertaining reading. And the professor-detective Roger Knight is an  unusual, likable and winsome character.	2000-03-29

Based on the legend of the Wild Hunt and the Demon Huntsman, it is full of outlandish characters and one hilarious, improbable event after another.  It's written for children, but grown-ups who enjoy humorous fantasy,  especially those who are fans of Diana Wynne Jones, should make sure they  don't miss out on this one.	2000-03-29

The two host an outrageous TV show proclaiming their new gospel of hedonism. To  complicate matters, their daughter has decided she wants to become a nun.  This is wonderful satire, and Ralph McInerny's wit is even sharper than  usual. All this, combined with ingenious plotting, makes &quot;Judas  Priest&quot; a most enjoyable read.	2000-03-29

King (and that's high praise). &quot;Strawgirl&quot; is the second in her series about Bo Bradley, a manic-depressive investigator of  child-abuse cases. Sounds like a downer, but it's not. Ms. Padgett's  skillful, imaginative writing, ingenious plotting and complex  characterization make this fascinating reading, high on my list of  unputdownable books. Bo Bradley is a most admirable, courageous and likable  character, as is psychiatrist and cult researcher Eva Blindhawk Broussard,  who is introduced in &quot;Strawgirl.&quot; I hope the publisher will make  this book available again soon. I had to seek out a secondhand copy, and it  was well worth the effort.	2000-03-29

I see the two books as  complementary rather than as competing. If you are a mystery fan, and if  you can possibly afford it, get both.	2000-03-28

The writing is inferior to that in  Mr. Pullman's other books, and some of the content is almost pornographic.  This might be all right in a book written for grown-ups (though I wouldn't  care to read it), but it doesn't belong in a YA book.	2000-03-28

His list of recommended books at the end is very useful. However, he is too rigid in his interpretation of dragons. Dragons are not  necessarily symbols of Satan. What about the dragons in the Psalms (in some  translations at least) that are exhorted to praise God? It would be  unfortunate if children, on Mr. O'Brien's advice, were to be denied the  pleasure of reading &quot;The Reluctant Dragon.&quot; Or Laurence Yep's  Chinese-dragon series. Or Patricia C. Wrede's delightful &quot;Dealing With  Dragons&quot; and its sequels. There is nothing harmful about these books,  or about Madeleine L'Engle's, Lloyd Alexander's and Stephen Lawhead's  fantasies, all of which celebrate virtue and the victory of good over evil.	2000-03-09

Informative, fascinating, great fun. This book includes an enormous variety of topics, expected and not, such as occult mysteries, feminism,  religion, politics, conservative and radical world-views, gays and  lesbians, country house mysteries, fairy tales. It is more comprehensive,  and has a more objective tone, than Bruce Murphy's &quot;Encyclopedia of  Murder and Mystery.&quot; There are extensive cross-references. Too bad the  editors didn't hire some proofreaders and fact checkers. The book is  riddled with typographical errors, misspellings and factual mistakes. Sue  Grafton's Kinsey Millhone is consistently misspelled &quot;Milhone.&quot;  In one instance, Margery Allingham's &quot;The Crime at Black Dudley&quot;  is attributed to Ngaio Marsh. In another, Dorothy Gilman's 1975 book  &quot;A Nun in the Closet&quot; is credited to Sister Carol Anne O'Marie. I  hope these errors will be corrected in a later edition.	2000-01-20

Despite the vampires, this is not a horror novel; it's a detective novel based on the premise that vampires really exist. The vampire Fleming is a nice guy, a neophyte vampire who is just learning to use the advantages and  cope with the disadvantages of his condition. My favorite character is  Fleming's friend and partner in detection, Holmes, oops, I mean Escott. As  all Sherlockians know, Escott is the alias Holmes used in the Charles  Augustus Milverton blackmail case. I'm looking forward to reading the rest  of the series.	1998-12-09
