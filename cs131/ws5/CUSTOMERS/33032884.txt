Anyone who has read this book will agree.  It is totally disjointed, one chapter does not quite follow the other in places, crooks appear and are never mentioned again.  One is renamed and unbelievable things occur - such as Mr. Hardy's sudden appearance in a cave in the woods with the Hardys.  What are the odds???  In this regard - the book was horrible.  Having said that - As a child I could not put this book down.  It drew me from page to page and it was among my favorites.  It has always crossed my mind that these books are geared primarily toward children and youth and perhaps therin lies some genious at work.  While an adult can pick the book to shreds, it fascinates it's intended target audience.  Anyone who has read the volume will tell you how horrible it is in one breath and then tell you they loved it in the next.  I am no different. It is full of imagination, creativity and brings to the table all the elements associated with a Hardy Boys book: Ghosts, Haunted House and a graveyard.  No other book among the first 58 can make this claim! So it is horrible in one respect and brilliant in another.  I rate it a weak 4 star. RATED B<br />REVISION: The 1964 - Don't even compare it to the original.  In places it was better - in places it was worse.  Strangely it made more sense - but lacked the \\"punch\\" of the original.  A good book certainly worth reading.	2004-05-04

The book is very slightly disjointed in places and perhaps more to the point it contains several glaring errors all too well known to most Hardy enthusiasts - ie: The incorrect names given for Mrs. Hardy & Chief Collig.  That said and those things aside this was a pretty good book.  As I child I held this book in high esteem.  It is a story about spies using a train called the Flying Express.  It is the brothers task to find the spies and their camp and bring them to justice.  It is too bad the book contains several errors because otherwise it had a great plot and was an enjoyable read.  More accurately I rate it a 3.4 star, the story a 4 star, the errors within a 2 star.  RATED B-<br />REVISION: The 1970 revision - from memory was a dud.  I may not be the best person to rate the revision.  I can simply say I read it once and was not impressed.  Its worth reading, but ranks among the bottom dwellers.	2004-05-04

In fact I cannot find anything wrong with it to any degree - except for this:  There are other books in the series that are better and it would be unfair to them to give this volume the same high rating as them.  Broken Blade was less breath taking, less action packed and less exciting than several other HB volumes, but I still regard this as a very good volume.  The plot is about a search for part of a sword and a race against time as the Hardys and unscrupulous characters hunt for the same sword simultaneously. Their objectives are the same but the goals are different. Who will find the blade first?  Broken Blade is one of the least talked about HB books. People rarely list it among their best or worst and it tends to go unnoticed by comparison.  RATED B-<br />REVISION: The 1970 revision was not as good as the first but I still regard it as a pretty good book in its own right and definitely worth reading.	2004-04-29

He begins with a bang.  The brothers are asked to investigate strange happenings at an Experimental Farm in Bayport.  The majority of this book takes place at night and in part in underground tunnels.  Unknown figures roaming about the farm hidden beneath black cloaks add an element of suspense.  This book has a spooky feel and one that draws the reader from page to page.  This book ranks among the series elite. RATED A<br />REVISION: The 1971 totally altered revision of this book with a completely new story was excellent, packed with pure suspense and a tough case to crack about two murders.

Dixon - Leslie McFarlane.  And it is apparent that he was now bored with the series and ready to move on.  I'm not sure whether to blame him or the one who drafted the outline for this book.  In any event, the main plot dealt with the brothers trying to find a hobby to satisy a cranky old man.  Since he had no idea what pleased him, he hired the brothers to come up with an idea.  Is it just me or is this a \\"yawner\\" of a plot.  Oh yes - and somewhere in there, is a ship that disappears from sight.  But despite the title - this Phantom Freighter plays a small role in the whole affair. First published in 1947 Russell Tandy draws a beautiful cover art for this book, but nothing else can be said of the volume that is positive.  Phantom Freighter is boring, dull, lacks any real mystery and contains little suspense of action.  As of 1947 it was the worst Hardy Boys book to date - Later to be outdone by another volume published 17 years later.  RATED F	2004-04-18

Secret Panel is one of the few volumes that revolved around a solid structure - that of a \\"spooky\\" mansion right in Bayport.  Aside from While The Clock Ticked no other volume deals with such a thing.  The book was swift paced from beginning to end and had some pretty creative cliff hangers that dealt with a revelation rather than predictable violence as was the case with The Arctic Patrol Mystery.  The criminals are elusive in this one and the brothers actually rely on sleuthing to figure this one out.  Great book RATED B+	2004-04-18

After this volume however, the writing style would change.  McFarlane wrote the original version of the book during his second stint with the Syndicate. I think the Syndicate had other ideas and let him finish The Melted Coins and World War II end before letting the hammer fall. In 1945 when the war ended this book was published then the heat was put on the author to bring the Hardy's into the scientific age. Like any of us at work, when change is implemented, we react with negativity. McFarlane at this point I feel became uninterested in the series and wrote his worst book to date only to be surpassed in 1947 by The Phantom Freighter. The book was medicore by Hardy Boys standards but subpar by McFarlane standards.  Taxidermy becomes the sub plot and fingerprinting is performed for the first time in the series with this volume. The child like innocence held in the earlier volumes is now gone.  I find this book somewhat difficult to rate.  To me it is a 2.4 - Still it is worth reading and not among the worst of the series by any means.  RATED C	2004-04-18

This review concerns the original 1944 story where a gang of criminals steals valueable coins and melts them down for sale.  The metal is worth more if they are still coins and are not melted.  Isn't this like \\"shooting one's self in the foot\\"?  I suppose it could be argued that the purpose for melting the coins was to avoid detection. Well....\\"Big Sigh\\" In any event, I really liked this book for many reasons.  The criminal Black Beard was perhaps the most memorable of any Hardy Boys villain.  And in the end - he was not that bad.  The scene in the tattoo parlor was a classic.  The book moved along well and had a beautiful cover art for its 1944 edition.  This was the second last edition to be completey revised chronology wise.  The Short Wave Mystery was the highest volume to be drastically altered.  The original Melted Coins is a great book. RATED A-<br />PS: The revised 1970 text was completely different and cannot hold a candle to the original.	2004-04-18

What drags this book down is the first 6 or so chapters.  However, by page 85 this volume picks up in a hurry and from this point forward is an excellent adventure story set in the west.  It mirrors Wildcat Swamp in some respects.  The book chronicles the brothers adeventures on a western ranch.  Tandy's artwork is exceptional as always.  Great book certainly worth reading.

It is often difficult to compare those books written before The Mark on The Door with those composed after Footprints Under The Window.  That being said this book opens with an introduction to a mystery when a friend of the Hardy's asks their assistance with a small mystery regarding fossil hunting in Wildcat Swamp.  Thus the title plays a part in the opening.  We learn of a trio of what I think are some of the more memorable Hardy crooks: Jessie Turk, Gerald Flint & Willie The Penman.  For the next several chapters as the Hardys & Cap Bailey prepare to leave Bayport they frequently encounter Flint & Turk on their way to Wildcat Swamp.  By page 45 or so, the trio of fossil hunters arrive in Wildcat Swamp and enter was is my favorite part of the book and what I often find is phase two of the volume.  The book seems to be broken into three sub volumes within the volume. The opening to their arrival in the swamp and the third phase after Underground Ambush.  During this second part of the book the trio initially encounter a wildcat which lets the reader know that the beasts are forever lurking throughout the swamp - but strangely after that one attack on Frank, no more wildcats appear.  Before long they meet Harry Sanders, son of the owner of the swamp who reveals its true name and that men have been interested in purchasing the property.  The Hardys then encouter 3 phony forest rangers Snake, Snide and Willie The Penman in a memorable scene and shortly afterward are caught eavesdropping by darkness on the rangers.  Trying to communicate with their father is cut short when their radio balloon is shot out of the sy by the rangers.  The memorable scenes in this book are endless - Frank's clue regarding \\"Three Odd Letters\\", the encouters with the rangers, Chet's arrival and he and Cap's<br />subsequent ambush in the underground cavern.  Enter the next phase in the book when the Hardys are ambushed themselves by the gang of outlaws.  This book beckons back to the days of 1881 and the old west - not 1952, and draws parallels with \\"The Twisted Claw\\", another book seemingly written during another era.  After their escape the brothers hop a train which eventually derails thanks to the gang and after a few more very well written chapters the Hardys assist in the capture of the gang.  This volume was packed with adventure, action, a great mystery and plot.  What young boy or grown man for that matter would not want to camp out in Wildcat Swamp and battle a gang of outlaws from the old west.  This is \\"wish fulfillment\\" at its best.  Again - I regard this as arguably the best book in the series.  RATED A+erground cavern.  Enter the next phase in the book when the Hardys are ambushed themselves by the gang of outlaws.

Nappi's 1968 revision was a vast improvement on the original cover and fishing trawler of a Sleuth portrayed on the front cover.  The book itself opens with a bang as the Hardys find a wallet full of money while out in Barmet Bay during a storm.  Personally I now think the Sleuth has a voodoo doll that has been hanging beneath somebody's shower head as everytime it seems they take out that boat it rains!!  This is a well written suspenseful adventure that takes place for the most part in the \\"North Woods\\" near Bayport.

Tony plays a prominent role in this one and to the books credit at least they encounter the criminals a fair amount and there is a little action.  The latter chapters were fairly decent.

Published in 1953 - This was one of the first books painted by Ruddi Nappi.  The Hardys live at Woodston College and try to help their friend solve the mystery of The Yellow Feather thought to be a dangerous character stalking their friend.  William Dougherty the author of this book wrote only two HB books.  The Secret of Wildcat Swamp and this one.  Upon learning that fact I realized why this book was as good as it was.  A pitty that Dougherty did not write more than he did.  Many parallels can be seen between the two.  I think of the Chapter in Wildcat Swamp \\"Three Odd Letters\\" when it is discovered that Wildcatters were buried in the swamp and not Wildcat.  In Yellow Feather we learn minor was mistaken for miner - which leads to the conclusion that the Yellow Feather was not a young man - but a mine in Canada.  We are kept in suspense throughout the book as to the identity of The Yellow Feather and as to the true intentions of Kurt the Headmaster at the College.  Hardy Boys books were never \\"scary\\".  But the scene around page 110 where Joe is walking alone outside a cabin back in the woods when he hears a rustling in the trees makes my spine tingle every time I read it.  Only scene I can think of that has that Stephen King element about it.  Very well written.  Overall this was one really fantastic book, a brilliant detailed cover art drawn by Nappi.

A revision of \\"The Melted Coins\\" written in 1970.  I thought - boring title - boring book.  I glanced at the back cover and after scouring the title wondered why I wasn't given The Ghost at Skeleton Rock.  Surely that volume dealing with ghosts would be scary and a great read.  When I finally read this volume I was greatly let down.  Perhaps the best titled book in the canon - it does not live up to fascinating title.  The brothers don't arrive at Skeleton Rock until the final two chapters basically and the ghost winds up being some air stuffed windbag.  There was no suspense.  The Hardys certainly weren't afraid.  I yawned through the whole thing myself.  This was the first volume cut from 200+ pages to roughly 180 pages.  The cover art was definately not among Rudi Nappi's best.

Still I find this book gets a bum rap for that very thing.  It is like the cover cursed the book.  There is a rather good subplot dealing with Chet & artwork.  The volume is rather violent in nature or one might say dangerous.  Knocked out - locked in a sinking drum in the middle of a lake, a sea monster - this volume is packed with action.

My biggest critique of this volume was simply this - and pardon me - but \\"American ignorance\\" And any Canadian will know what I'm talking about.  First of all, before something goes to print - get your facts together and make sure its accurate.  I see this with Scooby Doo, The Hardy Boys and other works of jeuvenille fiction.  Americans think there are no English people in Canada!.  The brothers travel to the Prairie provinces in Canada in this volume and meet up with who?  PIERRE!  A Frenchman.  Everytime Americans come to Canada they run into French police officers, French fur traders, French lumberjacks etc.  French people historically settled in Quebec, New Brunswick and to a lesser degree Nova Scotia - NOT the Prairies - which was settled by people of Ukranian ancestry.  My problem with this volume is simply a lack of knowledge on behalf of the Syndicate.  The book itself otherwise is medicore.  RATED C-	2003-01-16

Probably not - so I shall refrain - but what in the name of crimony were these people thinking when they published this compilation of letters and sentences and stamped the name Hardy Boys Mystery on it?????????????  This WAS without a doubt the WORST book in the entire series.  My opinion - they got this mixed up with the Bobsey Twins series and put the wrong name on it.  Written by Harriett Adams - no surprise!  Anyone who has read her works (Namely Nancy Drews volumes 35-56) will understand why this book is as bad as it is.  First of all this book deals with genealogy and a descendant of an Aztec Warrior getting an inheritance.  Now come on people - think about this.......Everytime I hear this sort of thing I wince.  Aztec Warriors lived in what century??  Let us suppose this Aztec Warrior was born in 1700 (And I'm being Conservative)  Do you realize how many descendants this person would have?  THOUSANDS!  Not one.  How could anyone legally or logically determine who was the rightful heir of someone who lived so long ago!  What a legal battle that would bring.  Volume #44 should not be The Haunted Fort.  It should have been titled THE HAUNTED LAW OFFICE.  Utter ridiculous plot.  Furthermore this was the most boring of any Hardy Boys book.  The cliff hangers in plain English - [were bad].  Actually WHAT cliff hangers?  You mean there were some?  I read this book once and that was enough.  I do not intend to ever read it again - unless alzheimers kicks in.  A one star rating is much to good for this one.  There had to be a worst book in the series somewhere and this was it.

The book is packed with an adequate amount of action - yet it was still rather difficult to remain interested. The brothers are hardly in Bayport, the writing is weak, and the is little to no mystery whatsoever. The theme is ballooning and naturally it is Chet's hobby. ... The brothers had a lot of interaction with the criminals which was good, and I rank this a strong one star, but not deserving of a 2. RATED D.	2003-01-16

The scene with the accidental phone number mixup always sounded a bit far fetched to me.  The cover art was poor, but yet the book was a decent read.  The brothers seemed to limit their travelling somewhat in this one.  Worth reading but far from the series elite.  Give it a weak 3 star rating.  RATED C	2003-01-16

Poor cover art - but the book was action packed with a lot of interaction with the criminals.  Among the higher volumes this has always been one of my prefered books.  The majority of the book is spent near Vampire Trail camped at the foot of an apparent mountain or large hill.  As boys enjoy camping in the great outdoors - it makes for an appealing read.

The Hardys go to Iceland, walk around there getting into one problem after another with things that have nothing to do with any mystery.  This book was about a bunch of dumb things that happened to the brothers.  Somebody would have a crisis upon the conclusion of each chapter which was overcome at the start of the following chapter. WOW! Throw out the sleeping pills!  For less money you can aquire a copy of The Arctic Patrol Mystery.  Guaranteed to make you yawn or your money back.  This book is a filler.  Buy it to complete your collection - read it once (And wish you hadn't - life is short) and go on to something else.  How in heck can ANYONE call this rubbage a mystery story????  This in my opinion was just about the worst book in the canon.  Just to clarify - I did not like it.	2003-01-16

It was a rather unique volume with the first 50 pages being a volume in itself and the remainder a subsequent to the opening.  By page 50, the brothers are at a Dead End thus the chapter \\"Dead End\\" is well named.  The brothers were at a stand still in solving this case.  After a brief 15 pages of little activity they head to Kentucky undercover at a construction site under assumed names using \\"jailbird language\\".  I absolutely loved this book.  It captured your imagination.  They were in the great outdoors among the enemy (Sleeping With the Enemy) working side by side with the very criminals they intended to bring to justice.  The book is packed with action & suspense.  RATED B+	2003-01-16

Good amount of action and swift paced. Lots of interaction with the criminals as a large amount of the book is spent with the Hardys in pursuit. Nonetheless - it cannot hold a candle to the earlier volumes in quality, writing style and suspense. RATED C-	2003-01-04

It has none of what we expect from the Hardy Boys. There is no suspense, no adventure and very little mystery. At least the brothers are in around Bayport for a change. The volume was lackluster. The artwork was disgusting. The cliff hangers had little to do with the mystery. RATED F	2003-01-04

However - the story was like no other - very good plot for the most part. It reminds me of a Star Trek episode that Trekies may recall in the original 1960's series involving \\"L'Andrew\\". The villagers in that show and in this book are all acting \\"wierd\\" and there exists a strange presence in the air. I never liked the swift paced higher volumes as well as the lower volumes - and this book written 30 years earlier may have become much better. The brothers travel to England - become involved in the pusuit of witches and is the only volume of it's kind. The criminals remain undisclosed until the very end - something I rather liked. A definate worth read. RATED C+	2003-01-04

However this volume is worth reading and did manage to hold my interest. The brothers travel down under and like so many books during this era incorporated way too much educational material about the place they were visiting. Hello - This is a Mystery series - not an atlas! Horrible artwork. No surprise there. Overall the book ranks between horrible and average. It did contain a little suspense in a few places. That is more than I can say about some of the other higher volumes. RATED C-	2003-01-04

One of the better picture covers during this era and it actually did happen around page 110 in the book! But beyond that, the internal artwork was horrible, and it was a rather dissconnected volume.
