Anyone who's ever called Microsoft or AOL for help with a technical problem and found themselves speaking to someone named \\"Julie\\" (who inexplicably spoke with an Indian accent) needs to read this book.  Any hard-working American who's had trouble making ends meet in the new global economy needs to read this book.  Any parent who has children in the U.S. public school system (which I think has been spiraling downward since the 1950s) needs to read this book.  Come to think of it, everyone with any kind of computer and simple internet access (meaning you) needs to read this book.<br /><br />At first I was less than enthusiastic about the premise for Friedman's account of how the world has, in his view, radically changed, or become \\"flat,\\" in the last ten years.  But after reading his incisive, passionate, and deeply researched thoughts on the outsourcing, insourcing, downloading, uploading, the dot.com bubble, and all the other technological and, yes, psychological changes going on in the world around us I was suddenly struck, as if by lightening, on how to assure my own place in the fiber optics age.  I now know that it's possible for me, or anyone else with their own form of wisdom, to no longer have to rely on clients in my own city or neighborhood.  I can now reach out to clients around the world - Denmark, Utah, Japan, Argentina, Virginia.  Yes, armed only with my hardwon knowledge of dog behavior and effective training methods (along with a $30 a month AOL account, and a used ThinkPad I bought at a local computer store for $500) I can now do MY part to change the world, one dog at a time.<br /><br />The fact is, it isn't that the world is changing around us.  It's already changed -- in dramatic, radical, and fundamental ways.  Read this book as an instruction manual on how to operate it.	2005-09-24

Catherine Crier is, I think, justifiably horrified at a movement in this country that is trying to do away with the hard-core values of American democracy, values that make this -- the most long-lasting republic in the world -- what it truly is, and will hopefully remain as long as God so grants us the right to be: the greatest nation on earth.<br /><br />It may come as a shock to some that those solid American values of which I speak are the values of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and Lincoln.  Jefferson was an agnostic.  Lincoln once said, \\"I care not for a man's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it.\\" (Being a dog lover, I love this quote.) Lincoln, who was perhaps our greatest President, especially when it came to upholding the ideals of democracy in the most difficult of times, was actually not a great believer in religion, though he was a great believer in God, something the current crop of right-wing Republicans have forgotten.  If Honest Abe were running for office today, given the power of certain parties in Washington and around the country, he would never be elected.<br /><br />The abolition of school prayer by the Supreme Court?  Terrible, right?  Not unless you want to overturn the freedom of religion guaranteed by our Constitution.  Some may feel that the U.S. government should uphold their own, specific religious values at all costs.  That's fine, I suppose, unless you can envision a time when the majority shifts to Islam or Judaism or Mormonism, and the Baptists and Catholics and Buddhists have someone else's religious values being shoved down their throats by Washington.  Then it wouldn't be so cool for the government to dictate what beliefs should be held by all Americans, whether they like it or not, would it?<br /><br />Crier, like all good citizens of this democracy, thinks religion should be a private, not a public issue.  Christ himself said, \\"Those who pray loudly and in a public place are an abomination before God.\\"  Let's follow Jesus' example and keep our relationships with God in private and let our government be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people - and I mean all the people, not just those who share your own specific religious beliefs.<br /><br />This book is a necessary cry for American ideals in the face of those who, unfortunately, use their version of \\"one country under God\\" to foist a decidedly UN-American agenda (an agenda which Crier rightly describes as chillingly similar to some of the religiously-controlled governments in the Middle East) on this great country of ours.d keep our relationships with God in private and let our government be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people - and I mean all the people, not just those who share your own specific religious beliefs.

It was an advance review copy, and had apparently been left there by some careless magazine reviewer or book editor to be recycled along with stacks of old newspapers and magazines.<br /><br />At the time I was trying to work out the basic format for my first novel, in what I hoped would be a continuing series (which it is now, by the way, thanks to Harper Collins/Avon).  I knew my main character, Jack Field, would be an ex-NYPD detective/dog trainer who takes early retirment to run a boarding kennel in Maine.  Since he was retired from detective work I wanted him to be in a romantic yet challenging relationship with a woman who was still active in law enforcement.  She would be a funny, romantic foil for him and would also draw him back into solving crimes.<br /><br />When I saw DEJA DEAD on the sidewalk and realized that the main character, Dr. Temperance Brennan, was a female medical examiner (though, technically, a forensic anthropologist), I picked it up and took it home.  My main motivation was to see how a real forensic expert would tell a story.  I'd read a few of Patricia Cornwell's books.  And while she'd done great research on all the technical points of her novels, she isn't a real forensic scientist.  Kathy Reichs is.<br /><br />Still, I didn't want Jamie Cutter (Jack's romantic crime-solving partner) to be like any other fictional female character out there.  I didn't want her to be a Temperance Brennan clone or to share any of Kay Scarpetta's personality traits, just her job description.  (Though to tell you the truth, I wouldn't have minded if some readers compared her to THE THIN MAN's Nora Charles, if only for Jamie's gifts at banter and her ability to bring Jack down a few notches whenever he gets too full of himself.)  But as I read DEJA DEAD I realized that there was more to Kathy Reichs than her scientific expertise.  She's the real deal.  I was riveted, astonished, thrilled, and on the edge of my seat as the story unfolded.  What a marvelous debut novel.<br /><br />With the popularity of the new Fox TV series, BONES, based on Reich's character from this and other books, I was recently motivated to re-read DEJA DEAD.  (Yes, unlike the careless reviewer or editor who'd put it out with the trash, I've hung on to my copy.)  The story still holds up.  It still grabbed me, astonished me, frightened me, and left me feeling like a damp wash rag when I was done reading it.<br /><br />If you like forensic based mysteries, you can't do better.I was riveted, astonished, thrilled, and on the edge of my seat as the story unfolded.

I was looking for a new training modality because I had this feeling that everything I had been taught about dogs was wrong. I was particularly dissatisfied with the alpha theory and the training techniques based on it.<br /><br />I read Kevin's book in one sitting and disagreed with almost everything he said except for two things: he teaches dogs to jump up on command, and he recommends playing hide-and-seek with a puppy when it starts its \\"independence phase\\" at about 5-6 months.  I'd already found out on my own that these were both very helpful training techniques but had never encountered any other dog trainers who recommended them (this was before I'd read PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, who also uses jumping up in her training system).<br /><br />The next day I tried one of Kevin's techniques with a pit-bull mix named Mickey, who had a problem with leash aggression: the instant he saw another dog on the street, he would go ballistic--lunging and growling, teeth bared. The only thing that prevented an all out attack was the fact that I'm a fairly big guy and I had an iron grip on his leash.<br /><br />After doing an exercise from Kevin's book three or four times, Mickey's behavior changed so dramatically that as soon as he saw another dog coming toward us, instead of lunging the way he did before, he would move back into position next to me, right into the pocket, and actually look up at me while performing the most perfect heel I'd ever seen.  The urge that had been so completely in control of his behavior before -- the desire to sink his teeth into the other dog -- had been transformed into an intense, almost magnetized focus on me.<br /><br />A week or so later I got a call from a woman who owned a Jack Russell terrier named Mack. The experts at the Upper West Side training school he'd attended told her that he was untrainable because he wouldn't learn the down. They said that there was probably something wrong with his breeding.  Mack's owner was in tears when she told me this, thinking that she had a \\"defective\\" dog.<br /><br />I took Mack into Central Park and applied one of Kevin Behan's techniques.  Basically I teased him with a tennis ball then got him to chase me around until he was crazy to bite it.  Then I taught him that if he wanted the ball he had to lie down to get it.  Within half an hour he was lying down on command and LOVING it! In fact, he'd do it while running at full speed!  And just like with Mickey, it was almost as if Mack's focus had been magnetized to me.  Mack's owner later told me that whenever she went out for pizza at a little place on Columbus, she would tie him to a parking meter and go inside to order her pie. From inside the restaurant all she had to do was look at him, put her index finger in the air and then point it toward the ground and Mack would instantly lie down on the sidewalk, happy and proud of himself. And this was a \\"defective\\" dog that couldn't learn to lie down on command!<br /><br />I cannot praise NATURAL DOG TRAINING highly enough. It's true that Kevin's prose style sometimes gets in the way. But when you apply the exercises he describes, and understand the underlying philosophy behind them (i.e., there's no such thing as an alpha dog, and that learning doesn't have to take place through association, trial and error, or countless repetitions), dog training becomes an amazingly enjoyable experience. But it's more than that.  In my case it actually changed my life because it's specifically designed to put both the dog and owner back in touch with nature.<br /><br />I now write a series of mystery novels with Kevin's philosophy and techniques woven into the storylines.  I get e-mails from readers who not only tell me they like my stories, but that they've tried Natural Dog Training and that their dogs are better-behaved as a result.<br /><br />Every dog lover, dog owner, and dog trainer should own this book!Every dog lover, dog owner, and dog trainer should own this book! <br /> <br />	2005-09-13

Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...<br /><br />The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, \\"What do we do on an elevator?\\" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, \\"Look!  They understand every word you say!\\"<br /><br />Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying \\"What do we do on an elevator?-we sit.\\"  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from \\"What do we do on an elevator?\\" to \\"Sit\\" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.<br /><br />Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog \\"understands\\" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.<br /><br />Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.<br /><br />Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.<br /><br />Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.<br /><br />Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.<br /><br />I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, \\"Do you love me?\\" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Doeshe understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.<br /><br />It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.<br /><br />If I could I'd give this book no stars at all.I say it to him?

If the REAL power elite of this country is out there committing atrocities, or just huge political blunders, in our name are we supposed to just stand back and cheer them on? The Real American Elite put Saddam Hussein into power in the first place. And no one's supposed to call attention to the hypocrisy going on now? Or even question the ethics involved in trying to prevent all the votes from being counted in a state run by a candidate's brother? This is America, man!  Democracy means you count ALL the votes.<br /><br />On the other hand Goldberg is quite right in stating that the cultural landscape of this country has become coarser, crasser, and more salacious than it ever was. Yeah, but so? What else is new? Mae West used to get basically the same rap in the 1930s that Madonna did in the 1980s. Personally, I don't much like either performer. (Give me Lombard and Lauper any day.) And I don't like Courtney Love or Britney Spears or Janet Jackson (okay, her I like a little - she can really sing). But I'm grown up enough and intelligent enough to know how to use a remote. And, damn! You know, it's the strangest thing, but I have NEVER in my life walked out of a record store and thought, \\"Wait! How did that Christina Aguilara DVD, with the near nakedness and the grinding hips, get into my shopping bag?\\"<br /><br />Look, in our society, with its Freedom of Speech and, by extension, our freedom of expression, there will always be those who \\"push the envelope\\" a little. Sometimes - as with Lenny Bruce and Charlie Parker - that may be a good thing. Sometimes - like with Madonna - it's just tiresome. At other times, as with the Victoria's Secret ads it's titillating at first then soon becomes kind of boring.  But as Cole Porter said, \\"In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking.\\" Porter was right. At one point in America's cultural development, the mere fact that you might see a woman's ankles was denounced as a sign of doom, from pulpit to Saturday Evening Post.<br /><br />What this means is that Goldberg, and those who agree with him on this issue, look as ridiculous (or will do fifty years from now) as those who decried the arrival of the flapper as the complete downfall of the American way of life. We survived bobbed hair and short skirts in the 1920s, went on to work our way out of the Depression, kicked Hitler's butt, and to paraphrase Stephen Sondheim, \\"We're still here.\\" I'm sure we'll survive nipple rings and Eminem.<br /><br />The truth is, I don't like the Britney Spears look or most rap music (I do like Spearhead) any more than Goldberg does, but what I REALLY hate, the thing that to me is more crass than a cultural costume change or the inevitable \\"coarsening\\" of the American language is putting the lives of our soldiers at risk over a blatant lie. Am I an America Basher because I believe this country deserves, and IS, better than that? Look at the outpouring of human decency from all over this country to the victims of Katrina, victims not only of the hurricane itself but of a terrible bureaucratic nightmare.<br /><br />Am I not allowed to say (or think) that just maybe the righteous Christian Bush sold his soul to the devil (Karl Rove) in order to attain power? Ask John McCain about the lies Rove spread about him during the Republican primaries. Isn't lying ALWAYS a sin, or are there exceptions to be made when you're running for office, or when you have your fat little toady do it for you?<br /><br />The ultimate hypocrisy is Goldberg's own use of language. Fifty years ago you could have never published anything that had the phrase \\"screwing up\\" in the title. Screw is now (and was then) a euphemism for the \\"F\\" word. Things change, B.G. And you're riding with the changes whether you cop to it or not.<br /><br />Look, I have no great fondness for the Democratic Party. I like Al Franken mostly 'cause he's funny; if I can get a few laughs out of the guy I don't mind so much his smarmy pomposity. And I have always intensely disliked Bill Clinton and thought he was a bald-faced liar from the git-go. In fact, since I'm a huge dog lover, if it were just about how each man behaves around his dogs, I would vote for George W. over Clinton any day. G.W. clearly loves his dogs, in fact dotes on them, which is a quality I greatly admire in anyone. But Clinton? I don't think he even knows what to make of the species. And John Kerry for President? What were those idiots thinking?<br /><br />But in my estimation what's really crass and really screwed up is using your own position of media power (which Goldberg and his coterie have, let's not kid ourselves) to foster hate, anger, bitterness, divisiveness, and, I'm sorry, complete ignorance (Jimmy Carter, who is one of the loveliest men on the planet, is somehow screwing up America?) just so you can rake in a little cash.<br /><br />But that's The American Dream, isn't it?

If she doesn't yelp in pain you haven't hit her hard enough.\\" -- pg. 44, orig. ed. HOW TO BE YOUR DOG'S WORST ENEMY) it's hard to take anything they say on the subject of dog training seriously.<br /><br />That said there is a modicum of sound and practical information in this book.  Not enough to override the horror of putting your dog in the hands of those who would advise you to hit her until she yelps in pain.  (If I had my way, it would be against the law to give such training \\"advice,\\" and probably IS in some jurisdictions.)<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the monks are way behind the times when it comes to understanding the nature of a dog's social instincts.  HINT: There is no such thing as an alpha wolf, alpha dog, or pack leader.  That is a complete myth, as has been proven by the top wolf experts in at least the last five years  These researchers don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because \\"it falsely implies a hierarchical structure.\\" (L. David Mech, et al, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002).<br /><br />And how do the monks reconcile the fact that \\"dominance displays are uncommon\\" among wild wolves (Mech, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 1999) with their belief that nearly everything a puppy does, in terms of its social behavior, is either dominance or submission?  If a dog's social instincts are inherited from wild wolves and if, according to the real experts on the subject (like Mech), wild wolves almost never act dominant or submissive towards one another, where is all this dominant and submissive behavior coming from?  Maybe from the way the monks treat the animals in their care?<br /><br />I've been training dogs in New York City for fifteen years and I've only seen one instance of what could be called dominant behavior, and it was between two adult males, both unneutered.  The owner of the dog that exhibited this behavior quickly stepped in, yelled at his dog, and smacked him really hard (though the dog didn't yelp in pain, so the man apparently didn't hit him hard enough).  Yes, that got the dog to temporarily stop what he was doing, but in my estimation it's just that kind of mistreatment that caused this totally unnatural behavior to develop in the first place!  Dogs who aren't mistreated never exhibit unnatural \\"dominant\\" behaviors.  They just don't.<br /><br />This is so sad to me because the real nature of the dog's social instincts is for cooperation, group harmony, and -- for lack of a better word -- love.  How do the monks get this so wrong?  Why don't they see this beautiful aspect of a dog's nature as being his primary social impulse?<br /><br />I guess when you live in a monastery and you have a mindset that tells you it's okay to hit dogs until they yelp in pain because they understand it's your right as a nonexistent \\"alpha wolf,\\" you're bound to be a little removed from reality.<br /><br />If you have the slightest twinge of love or compassion for your puppy, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!his behavior quickly stepped in, yelled at his dog, and smacked him really hard (though the dog didn't yelp in pain, so the man apparently didn't hit him hard enough).

I'm still laughing over that.  Stanley Coren!?  It's widely known in dog circles that Coren gets almost everything about dogs exactly backwards (read my review of THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS for further elucidation)!  It seems to me, from reading this person's review, that she somehow misunderstood the simple information in Kalstone's book and instead of admitting her own inability to follow instructions, she blames the author.<br /><br />Okay, now to my review of this very useful housebreaking guide, one that I recommend to all my clients with new puppies.  I have to say that except for Kalstone's occasional forays into punishment, via the alpha theory (which we now know is totally false), this book gives you almost everything you need to know about housetraining.  The fact that she's broken-down the various schedules any dog owner might need, allowing for various work schedules and life-styles, makes this book a must-have for every owner of a new puppy.  (It's why I recommend it to all my clients -- it saves them and me the time of sitting down and writing up a schedule of their own.)<br /><br />She also gives good advice on how to acquaint any puppy with a crate, and gives the info (that most other books don't) that a puppy's emotional and physical development prevent him (or her) from really learning this stuff before about 3 1/2 to 4 months of age.  Just please, please, ignore everything she says about being the pack leader, being alpha, etc., and you and your puppy will do just fine.<br /><br />By the way, most of the information in this book (and a little more) is also contained in Kevin Behan's NATURAL DOG TRAINING, with just one omission: Kevin doesn't include the actual training schedules that you can rip out of the Kalstone book and paste on to your refrigerator door!<br /><br />I rarely give ANY training book 4 stars.  Yay, Shirlee Kalstone!!    I rarely give ANY training book 4 stars.  Yay, Shirlee Kalstone!	2005-09-07

And it comes so very close to being right on the money about what makes that homo sapiens/canis familiaris relationship work that I was hungrily turning the pages, hoping and wishing that Clothier would finally hit the nail on the head, which, unfortunately, she never quite does.  How so?<br /><br />There are so many instances in this book that echo almost exactly what I would do when personally training a dog, or that state almost verbatim what I routinely and quite adamantly recommend that my clients' do with their dogs.  Yet the underlying reasons Clothier gives for doing the exercises are slightly off the mark (in my opinion).  She's so frustratingly close to really understanding dogs but she doesn't quite make that final leap that would stick the landing, that would earn her a 9.9, that would totally make sense to dogs AND humans.<br /><br />For instance, Clothier's explanation of how she trained her client's dog Angel how to walk on the leash is almost word for word what I would tell a client: a taut leash will make the dog want to pull so make sure the leash is never tight.  And instead of punishing the dog for pulling, why not play a game where you run away and get him to chase you around?  This makes him want to connect to you.<br /><br />Ah, but connect to you how?  I would say that he wants to connect to you through his prey drive (since that's the organizing principle behind all canine social behavior), and that the \\"Chase Me\\" game she plays with Angel mimics the way dogs (and wolf pups) play together as a way of preparing themselves for the hunt.  (Dogs love to chase things.)  Unfortunately, Clothier never quite puts two and two together and falls back on the old myth that the pack instinct is about who is and who ISN'T the pack leader.  She doesn't get that the most recent research on canids--wolves and wild dogs--shows that there IS no pack leader.  Dogs do not relate to us because they instinctively need a TOP DOG to show them the way to do things.  They relate to us because their social instincts, which are solely geared for hunting large prey, nothing else, give them an instinct for group harmony and cooperation which essential for the success of the hunt, and, therefore, essential for their own survival.<br /><br />Admittedly, Clothier DOES mention the cooperative aspect of the dog/trainer dynamic, which she's absolutely right about.  But she unfortunately still believes in the old myths about pack social structure -- leaders and followers, which are mythical beings that cannot possibly exist in a dog's mind.<br /><br />Still, other than NATURAL DOG TRAINING by Kevin Behan, and to a limited extent PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, no one comes closer to getting it right than Clothier.  (And she's a better writer than Behan or Burnham).  It is extremely rare for me to give a dog training book four stars.

Being a dog trainer, I asked how her training was going.<br /><br />\\"Oh, well,\\" the wife said, \\"we bought this book called GOOD OWNERS, GREAT DOGS, and we tried some of the techniques in it, but Bailey didn't like them.  Particularly when we tried to train her to lie down on command.  She'd just run away.  We found that if we just use her favorite toy, she has a tendency to obey quicker and she actually likes learning.\\"<br /><br />That's what I'd discovered; that the old way of doing things--always forcing the dog into position, etc.--was actually detrimental to the learning process.  And that playing games with the dog was always a better choice.  I'd also learned that Brian Kilcommons' mantra that training should be \\"fun, fair, and firm\\" was actually a little light on the \\"fun\\" component and way too heavy on the \\"firm\\" part.<br /><br />The sad thing is, I've seen Kilcommons on TV in the last five years or so, and his approach to training has completely changed, or at least it seems to have done.  He now advises more of a playful approach, and less of a forceful way of teaching commands.  (Since I publish a series of newsletters in New York City, where Kilcommons used to work and reside, I've gotten the perhaps ridiculous notion that my ideas have been influential in this change.)<br /><br />Still, this book has some good information.  It'll just be up to you, as a conscientious and loving dog owner, to determine which exercises seem too harsh, and which you think will make your dog more amenable to learning.  It can be pretty easy to tell the difference too, even if you're a novice.  Just look at the body language of the dogs on one side of a page (scared, frightened, angry) as opposed to the dogs on the opposite side (usually happy and compliant).<br /><br />I think Kilcommons should write a new training manual, get rid of all the \\"firm\\" stuff, and concentrate more on the playful aspect of training.  Three stars.ff, and concentrate more on the playful aspect of training.  Three stars.	2005-08-30

(I didn't want to repeat something that had been done before.)  God bless him, he insisted that I read JUST A CORPSE AT TWILIGHT.<br /><br />Reading it was both a blessing and a curse.  I knew that there was no way I could make better use of Maine as a backdrop to my novel than van de Wetering had for his.  I also knew that it didn't matter.  This novel is a one-of-a-kind wonder.  I could only hope in some small way to create characters and situations both as realistic and as absurd as he had.  I hope to hell I haven't unconsciously copied anything he's done, but I couldn't blame myself too much if I had.  Some writers - Hammett, Twain, Salinger, Kerouac, and Faulkner - are so good that it's hard not to emulate them.  Van de Wetering is on that list.<br /><br />WARNING: Read this novel only if you like Zen detectives from Amsterdam who get drunk under the stars, fall in love with Polynesian beauties working at coffee shops along the Maine coast, or feel that the mysteries inherent to forensic and legalistic puzzles don't matter half as much as existential ones.	2005-08-30

Paul Loeb is so OFF about so many things, and yet writes with such utter conviction about them, that you have to wonder what mental institution he escaped from.<br /><br />His theory of \\"the magic hand\\" is preposterous.  Does throwing things at dogs get their attention?  Of course.  Will the dog then go over and sniff the object?  Nine times out of ten, sure.  Does that mean he's made a \\"mystical connection\\" between the object and the person who threw it, thinking that his owner has a \\"magic hand\\" that follows him wherever he goes?  You're kidding, right?  He sniffs it because he wants to know what it is and why it just scared the bejebus out of him.  Will having an object thrown at a dog make him immediately come back to you?  Maybe, sometimes.  But it's pretty unreliable.  Plus, you could just teach the dog to do it on command.  (When I call the dogs I've personally trained, they'll turn on a dime and run back to me, even while in the middle of chasing a squirrel or a rabbit; it's easy and fun and doesn't involve thrown objects--except maybe a tennis ball or two.)<br /><br />Loeb says his technique was \\"invented\\" when, out of frustration at not being able to control his own dog, he threw the leash at her.  She sniffed it and came running back to him.  His feeble imagination put two and two together and came up with oranges.  A \\"magic hand?\\"  Heck, it seemed to me, when I read his description, that the dog was frightened and came back to the relative safety of being by his side.  As for Loeb's contention that he invented this technique, why is it that many dog trainers have been using what's called a \\"throw chain\\" for years and years before Loeb ever wrote this laughable book.<br /><br />Oh, and his OTHER favorite training strategy?  Spanking the dog!  (Yep, that's really intelligent.)<br /><br />Will his techniques work with some dogs some of the time?  Of course.  Most techniques do.  That's why you have the Monks of New Skete on one side, claiming that their way is right, and Jean Donaldson and Patricia McConnell on the other, claiming, no, our way is best.  The thing about dogs is that they have a wonderful, innate capacity for obedience.  They like it.  It's what they're built to do.  The mistake is in thinking it's the technique you use when it's simply part of the dog's nature.<br /><br />However, I've tried both dominance training and \\"operant\\" conditioning and I've found that, since the prey drive is the organizing principle behind almost all canine behavior, the only method that works equally well on all types of dogs, under all conditions, is some form of play training, where you stimulate the dog's hunting instinct and use it as the focal point of training.  This approach is described by Patricia Gail Burnham in PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG, or by Kevin Behan, in the more comprehensive, NATURAL DOG TRAINING.  Another good book is SCHUTZHUND: THEORY AND TRAINING PRACTICES by Susan Barwig and Stewart Hilliard.  Max Von Stephanitz, who invented the sport of schutzhund, said, \\"Before we teach the dog to obey we must teach him how to play.\\"  Meanwhile, Paul Loeb, tells you NOT to play with your dog because they can't tell the difference between play and aggression.

We were not great friends by any means. I always thought of us more as friendly rivals, though I acted in a couple of plays he wrote, and I directed him in a commedia dell arte I produced for a local Renaissance Faire.<br /><br />As for Scott's novels, the only \\"ScFi\\" authors I've really read and liked are Phillip K. Dick, Douglas Adams, and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., so I never cared much to keep up on my former classmate's career. My only reason for reading ENDER'S GAME, which I did recently, was that I finally decided to see how good old Scott was doing with his little SciFi stories.<br /><br />Pretty well, apparently. ENDER'S GAME is one of the most compelling, the most intensely moving, the most mind-shattering, gut-wrenching, soul-enriching pieces of fiction I've ever read. You can't compare it to other works of literature because it goes beyond that, it really does. I'm serious about this. Back in college I never complimented Scott on anything. I was always fundamentally opposed to feeding his ego, which was very healthy and doing just fine on its own. And I sure as hell don't want to be doing it now (not that he'll read this, or care if he does). But -- wow! -- I mean, we won't know for sure, at least not for maybe another five hundred years or so, but I have a feeling ENDER'S GAME may take its place alongside the Grail legend, the Odyssey, and who knows what other tales of the soul's journey you can name. This is not a novel, it's a guidebook for those who have to take that trip.	2005-08-24
US	19330720	R1WN00O02EUL3W	1891767054	548408150	I'll be Home Soon: How to Prevent and Treat Separation Anxiety.	Books	4	71	94	N	N	A Thorough, Comprehensive  Pamphlet with Only Two (Major) Errors	A client recently gave me her copy of I'LL BE HOME SOON.  She said it hadn't helped with her dog's separation anxiety and she thought I might like to read it.  I have and I think it's very thorough, comprehensive clearly written, intelligent, with only two things that are more than slightly off the mark (which is something I've come to expect from McConnell).  Still, I would absolutely recommend that anyone with a dog suffering from this affliction, or anyone who wants to prevent their puppy from developing it in the first place, buy a copy.<br /><br />My caveats?<br /><br />ONE: The recommended De-Sensitization and Counter-Conditioning techniques only work about 15% of the time, if at all.  That's been my experience.  I've only met one dog owner who said a behaviorist had actually helped solve her dog's separation anxiety.  (\\"Really?  How?\\" I asked.  \\"Elavil,\\" she replied.)  Also, there was a (roughly) two year period, about thirteen years ago, where I experimented with operant conditioning techniques myself and found they rarely worked to solve severe behavioral problems of ANY kind for more than a brief window of time.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have never seen a more thorough and comprehensive outline for applying these techniques.  That's something I hadn't taken into account.  Certainly, between your dog and you, sooner or later one or the other of you is going to HAVE to get tired of doing these exercises, so I suppose if you have the stamina to outlast a frantic, frenetic pooch, god bless you; you may very well be successful in curing the problem without drugs, and more power to you.<br /><br />TWO: McConnell simply doesn't understand the inner workings of the dog's psyche.  She just doesn't get it.  First of all, she talks about the need for being a \\"benevolent pack leader\\" when no such animal exists.  That whole idea of the social hierarchy is a fantasy, a myth.  And anyway, a dog who goes through a door ahead of you is not doing it because he doesn't know his place in the social pecking order (since there isn't one).  He just wants to go for a walk.  Is that so hard to understand?  (Actually, there's more to it than that but space here is limited.)<br /><br />Secondly, McConnell recommends training a specific stay exercise (one that I call the \\"peek-a-boo stay\\"), which I've found is vitally essential for curing separation anxiety.  The only problem is she recommends using a treat as the focal point of the training, which is absolutely the wrong way to go about it.  Food actually creates an unnecessarily difficult learning process for the dog.  You need to use a toy instead.  That's because the behavior of holding still, not moving, keeping in one place for an increasingly longer and longer period of time, is already built into the animal's DNA as part of his predatory sequence: THE SEARCH > THE EYE STALK > THE CHASE > THE GRAB BITE > THE KILL BITE.  Stimulating, amplifying, and satisfying this sequence, particularly the EYE STALK, while the urge to bite a is present, puts the dog's instincts back into balance.  And separation anxiety, like most behavioral problems, is caused by the animal's instincts being OUT of balance in the first place.  Biting games, like tug-of-war, where you always let the dog win and praise him enthusisastically for winning, will also help.  (These are the two main things that have always helped my clients' dogs, including the one who gave me this booklet.)<br /><br />One other thing McConnell fails to mention: This condition should probably be called \\"separation PANGS.\\"  That's because a 2003 research study done at UCLA shows that feelings of social exclusion are registered in the anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that controls feelings of actual physical pain.  So the animal is, in all likelihood, feeling severe physical pain when he acts out while you're gone.  (Poor baby...)<br /><br />Still, even with these flaws in mind, I seriously doubt if anyone who goes to the average \\"behavioral specialist\\" in their town or city will end up with anything even anywhere close to the amount of good, solid information that's contained in this little pamphlet.  Four stars, even with my two caveats.ty will end up with anything even anywhere close to the amount of good, solid information that's contained in this little pamphlet.

US	19330720	R2CV62MC0WS362	0764536095	172549689	The Power of Positive Dog Training (Howell reference books)	Books	2	367	427	N	N	Nestled in the Arms of the Zeitgeist	I've been watching the changing trends in dog training for about thirty years, using a kind of semiotics approach to the subject, meaning that what you see in any one specific discipline--science, politics, or the arts--may be reflective of an underlying trend within the zeitgeist itself.<br /><br />For dog training, back in the 70s it was the Woodhouse way, even though Babs was kind of insane:  \\"If your dog keeps getting into the chicken coop and killing your chickens, there's nothing to do but kill one of them yourself and beat the offending pooch about the head with the carcass!\\"  (I'm paraphrasing, but still...)<br /><br />Next came the alpha theory, with all the dominance trainers proclaiming that their method was based on \\"scientific evidence\\" about canine social behavior, which we now know is a fallacy. According to recent research there is no hierarchy in wild wolf packs and the hierarchies that form in captive wolf groups are totally unnatural.  According to authors Masson and McCarthy there is no pecking order in some chicken groups (which is where the idea of dominance hierarchies got its start, back in the 1920s).  And according to animal researchers John McNutt and Lesley Boggs, the wild dogs of Africa, who form highly organized social groups, and are the most successful predators in Africa, have no pack leader.<br /><br />This is my roundabout way of saying that I'm amused by the current crop of authors of \\"positive\\" dog training books such as Pat Miller, who have a gung-ho, we've finally found it, this is the real way to train attitude.  Like Miller I used to train the old-fashioned way and found that it was destructive to the social bond I had with the dogs I trained.  So I'm opposed to those methods, just as all \\"positive\\" trainers are.  And I have no beef with Miller or Jean Donaldson or any of the +R mavens from that standpoint.  But from what I can see we're currently living in a zeitgeist, a world culture where rigidly held belief systems--whether they're of a religious, political, or dog training nature--hold sway over real ethical and moral values, and stand in the way of the search for truth.<br /><br />There are three main points where I think \\"positive\\" trainers diverge from truth and ethics:<br /><br />ONE: Dogs hate head halters.  THEY HATE THEM.  Yet all the \\"positive training\\" books recommend this hateful device that tortures a dog's emotions.  Since it's been propagandized as a \\"positive training tool\\" it fits the trainer's pre-molded belief system, which prevents him or her from objectively examining the facts.  This is NOT a positive training tool.  In fact it's not a training tool at all.  It's designed to relentlessly punish the dog for pulling, and does NOTHING to teach him how to enjoy walking next to you.<br /><br />TWO: One of the main \\"talking points\\" for most positive trainers is that dogs have a \\"what's in it for me\\" attitude, which they say is the key to training.  And while the survival instincts of ALL animals impose a strong directive toward self-interest, dogs are the one species that is least likely to exhibit a \\"me first\\" attitude as the chief feature of their psychology.  If you ask me, they have more of a \\"what can I do with my energy?\\" or a \\"what can we do together?\\" attitude; they're genetically engineered to want to be team players.<br /><br />THREE: Positive techniques aren't all that positive.  They rely too much on food, which is an extrinsic reinforcer, and therefore can create a negative learning experience for the dog.  And some techniques for dealing with problem behaviors actually put the dog in a confused, lonely, and agitated state.  That's not nice and it's not positive.  Instead of forcing the dog to figure out \\"How can I get a reward from my owner?\\" I think it's better and more effective to use techniques that build the reward into the behavior, via intrinsic reinforcers.<br /><br />Some books that show you how to do this are PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, NATURAL DOG TRAINING by Kevin Behan, and SCHUTZHUND: THEORY AND TRAINING METHODS by Susan Barwig and Stewart Hilliard.  Granted, you may have to \\"weed out\\" some of the techniques in some of these books (particularly the schutzhund book), but at heart they're all much more positive AND more ethical than THE POWER OF POSITIVE DOG TRAINING.<br /><br />But if your desire is for a training manual that fits in with the current trend or tells you what you already believe about dogs, by all means read and implement the techniques in THE POWER OF POSITIVE DOG TRAINING.  It may not make your dog's life all that better, but you'll be safely nestled in the arms of the zeitgeist.ZHUND: THEORY AND TRAINING METHODS by Susan Barwig and Stewart Hilliard.

The information on nutrition alone is worth the price of admission.  It's a well-worn part of my dog's reference library.<br /><br />I only have two caveats: one is that even though Pitcairn constantly recommends talking things over with your vet, especially when it comes to serious health issues, the general tendency of some people drawn to this type of material will be to use an all-natural-or-nothing approach, try everything and see if it works, and NOT talk to the vet.  This is not a criticism of the book itself, but a generic problem.<br /><br />My other caveat is going to sound heretical to some readers, which is that Dr. Pitcairn, who's an advocate of all-natural treatments, recommends spaying and neutering, which is totally unnatural and unhealthy.  It's understandable for him to do this, given the nature of the overpopulation problem we have in this country, I just wish Dr. Pitcairn had been more truthful about the subject and hadn't resorted to the standard propaganda.  The truth is, testosterone may help male dogs live healthier, longer lives.  And research shows that natural levels of the hormone promote calm behavior so males are generally LESS aggressive when left intact.  And as a trainer who uses natural dog training methods I find that intact dogs, male and female, are also much easier to train.  (Anther quibble: Pitcairn doesn't mention that vasectomies are a healthy alternative to castration, and are a less invasive form of surgery.)<br /><br />Still,it's a must-have for anyone interested in their pet's health and well-being.

This is a comprehensive, well-written, well-organized book on the methods that come under the banner of \\"positive training,\\" and are loosely based on B. F. Skinner's experiments with rats and pigeons, locked inside boxes.  If you want to learn these techniques you can't find a better, more thorough manual than what Pam Dennison has written.<br /><br />So why only three stars?  The way I see it, just because you CALL a method positive doesn't make it so.  (The Monks of New Skete call their methods \\"compassionate\\" even though they recommend hitting a dog, and even tell you that if she doesn't yelp in pain you haven't hit her hard enough!)<br /><br />So let's look at a \\"positive\\" technique for teaching a puppy not to jump up.  (This method isn't specifically given in Dennison's book, it's just illustrative of the kind of fuzzy thinking going on right now about what is and isn't positive training.)<br /><br />The trainer puts the pup on a six-foot leash, ties the leash, then she approaches him in a manner that will induce him to want to jump up.  If he tries, he gets two punishments, one from a self-correction on the leash, the second from the trainer, who turns her back on him and says, \\"Too bad,\\" then walks away, leaving the pup feeling frustrated and lonesome.  This is done over and over until the puppy, terribly confused, and not knowing what else to do, sits, hoping to avoid both negative experiences.  Then the trainer praises the puppy and gives him a cookie.  The little guy wags his tail happily but still has no idea that the reason he got both the cookie and the contact he so badly desired from the trainer was because he didn't jump up on her (a dog can't learn a negative), so the trainer has to do this over and over until the puppy finally gives up on this natural social reflex that also holds the key to teaching the heel, the recall, and even a focused sit.  (\\"Too bad.\\")<br /><br />That said, I certainly don't believe dogs should be allowed to jump up on people.  But I DO think they should be TRAINED to jump up on command, and then taught to channel or redirect the energy of that positive social reflex into other behaviors.  They should also learn that they can jump up ONLY when the command is given first.<br /><br />A behaviorist would say, \\"Oh, well, that's all conditioning too.\\"<br /><br />Fine, if you say so.  But dogs learn better and retain the lessons longer when their hunting instincts are stimulated.  They're group predators by nature, which is why most of us have bins or baskets full of Frisbees, tennis balls, and tug toys.  In fact, when dogs are in a highly playful mood, they can learn some behaviors just once and the lesson never has to be repeated for the rest of the dog's life.  Is that information in THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE?  Not exactly.  Dennison DOES laud play as a \\"positive reinforcer\\" but has nothing to say about the fact that it can be used to teach a lesson just once, so that the dog never forgets it, because that goes against the \\"laws\\" of behavioral \\"science\\" (even though it's how animals learn all the time).  And I can guarantee you that it's a far more natural and positive way for that funny, furry rascal of yours to learn ANYTHING than it is by turning your back on him and saying, \\"Too bad.\\"<br /><br />So why did I give this book any stars at all?  Because there are a lot of people intent on learning \\"positive training\\" techniques, and of all the handbooks I've read on the subject this is the most detailed, the easiest to understand, and the most fun to read.  There's a lot of behavioral science hogwash, of course, with all the usual +R \\"talking points\\" (dogs are only in it for themselves, eg., which is true to some extent of ALL species, but is least true about the dog).  But that sort of thing is to be expected.

Is this really \\"listening to dogs?\\"<br /><br />According to Fennell the alpha wolf leads the hunt, and the rest of the pack is \\"programmed to follow his every move\\" and obey his every command.  This is a fantasy, pure and simple.  It's a fairy tale.  It's not how things really work.<br /><br />Dr. L. David Mech, whom some regard as the world's leading expert on wolves, writes, \\"THE CONCEPT OF THE ALPHA WOLF AS A `TOP DOG' IS MISLEADING.\\"  (Mech, L. David. 1999. \\"Alpha Status, Dominance, and Division of Labor in Wolf Packs.\\" Canadian Journal of Zoology.)  In another article from 2002, Mech and his colleagues detail their studies of how wolf packs travel while on the hunt, and which wolf is in the lead at any given moment.  It turns out that the leadership role is more elastic than previously thought, and depends on certain variables.  No one wolf leads the pack at all times.  It's more of a shared activity.<br /><br />So here, in THE DOG LISTENER, we have a case of someone who sort of understands dogs, at least on an unconscious level when working with them, but who doesn't understand them at all when trying to explain why her techniques work.<br /><br />Case in point: Spike, an aggressive dog who is supposedly this way because he \\"thinks he's alpha.\\"  Fennell approaches the dog in way that, she says, lets him know that she's ALSO alpha (which is pretty comical since \\"alpha\\" means first, and how can they BOTH be first?).  I've encountered just such situations numerous times and in my view it's more probable that Spike, like most aggressive dogs, has been mistreated at some point in his life, which caused a hyper-vigilance response to danger, even when no actual danger is present.  By acting calm and confident, Fennell defuses Spike's sense of being threatened; that's all she does.  In fact, I would say that her calmness becomes magnetic for Spike.  But he no more sees her as \\"another alpha\\" than he sees her as Captain Kangaroo or the Man in the Moon.<br /><br />Another case is her experiences watching London police dogs in training, and why they're always given a toy when they do things correctly.  She sees this as just another form of \\"positive reinforcement.\\"  And while it's true that play is usually  the best reinforcement for dogs, for most working dogs it's much more than that.  When dogs are trained via their prey drive they have to be given a toy every single time they're successful because biting the toy completes the predatory sequence: SEARCH > EYE STALK > CHASE > GRAB BITE > KILL BITE.<br /><br />The dogs in London were trained to SEARCH for hidden bad guys but when they found them (EYE STALK) they were not allowed to CHASE or GRAB BITE, they were trained to bark instead.  As soon as a dog barked at a hidden volunteer, the handler tossed a ball over the dog's shoulder and he went after it, like a puppy in play.  If the dog isn't given that tennis ball to CHASE and BITE, the predatory sequence would be incomplete and he wouldn't work as well the next time or the next.  That's why these dogs are always reinforced (which breaks one of the laws of operant conditioning, that a dog whose behavior is always reinforced will be less reliable; and here the exact opposite is true).<br /><br />So, if Fennell doesn't understand why her methods work, why DO they work, or do they work at all?  I think some of them do, but only because she unconsciously gives the dogs a harmonious and predictable social structure.  That's all.  Canines are geared toward creating and maintaining a cooperative social dynamic that provides feelings of safety and \\"predictablility,\\" and that also enables them to hunt large prey by working together as a unit.  When that structure isn't there, the animals become stressed and a totally UNnatural structure develops, one that's similar to the way wolves behave when forced to live together in captivity, NOT the natural way wolves behave when living in the wild.<br /><br />David Mech again: \\"Most research on the social dynamics of wolf packs has been conducted on wolves in captivity. These captive packs formed dominance hierarchies featuring alpha, beta, omega animals, etc. With such assemblages, these dominance labels were probably appropriate, for most species thrown together in captivity would usually so arrange themselves.  IN NATURE, HOWEVER, THE WOLF PACK IS USUALLY A FAMILY, or sometimes two or three...\\"<br /><br />Wolves are genetically predisposed to deal with the stress of life in the wild, but they're sadly unequipped to handle the stressors that come with life in captivity.  And it seems to me that what's most unnatural for both captive wolves and some domesticated dogs is not being given an outlet for their predatory passions.  (This doesn't mean that you should let your dog roam around the neighborhood, killing cats and chasing cars; they're group predators, they need to have a social structure while hunting, which is why the tennis ball was invented.)<br /><br />So we see that the unnatural stress of being unable to use one's predatory energy is what actually causes the equally unnatural dominance behaviors that arise in domesticated dogs and in captive wolves.  It's also why when your dog develops a behavioral problem one of the first questions an intelligent trainer will ask is, \\"Is your dog getting enough exercise?\\"  That's because vigorous, playful physical exercise reduces stress.  It's not the total answer, but it's a start.<br /><br />And if you REALLY want to \\"Learn How to Communicate with Your Dog for Willing Cooperation\\" train him (or her) the way those London police dogs were trained.  The kind of methods they and other K-9 trainers use have been adapted for training pet dogs by Kevin Behan in his book NATURAL DOG TRAINING.  (He actually began his career by training dogs for various police departments around the Northeast.)  A book with a similar approach is PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham.

However, like all books of this type, when you cover all the bases (which THE ORIGINAL DOG BIBLE does) you end up not being specific enough about certain topics.  Since canine behavior and training is my area of expertise that's what I'm focusing on here.<br /><br />For instance, in a section about how to stop your puppy from biting, the ORIGINAL DOG BIBLE says, \\"Do not allow your dog to nip or bite when playing.\\"  That's good advice, in a way, but how?  By punishing the dog?  Scolding him?  Or by simply ending your playful interactions with the pup and not re-initiating them until he figures out how NOT to use his teeth in play.  The author, Kristin Mehus-Roe, leaves it to the reader (and, I suppose, to the dog) to fill in the blanks.  She also gives out the old advice about how to play tug-of-war; in other words, don't let the dog win.  Actually, the opposite is the best way.  You should always let the dog win and always praise him enthusiastically for winning.  This increases the dog's interest in the game, builds confidence, curbs aggression, and has a tendency to increase his ability and desire to focus on you even when there are strong distractions around.<br /><br />In the section on a dog's social behavior this book is also a little behind the curve.  The author is half right, in that she says dogs are genetically engineered (my phrasing) to form close social bonds.  That's good.  I like that.  It's accurate and it gives dog owners the right, loving frame of mind in dealing with their pups.  But then she goes on to say that the pack is \\"a power hierarchy,\\" and that a dog's \\"rank can rise and fall.\\"  This is outdated information, based on old research.  In fact, when wolves live in the wild the packs are cooperative in nature, not antagonistic.  And there is no hierarchy at all.  Hierarchies only form when wolves live (stressfully) in captivity and are forced to form very unnatural groups.  It's been my experience that dogs only exhibit these unnatural types of hierarchical behaviors when they're under stress as well.<br /><br />Still, this is a must-have book.  So if you feel the need for a compendium of dog \\"knowledge\\" always ready at your fingertips, THE ORIGINAL DOG BIBLE will do just fine until something better comes along.  (But don't count on that happening; it must have been damn hard to get as much information into this one volume as Mehus-Roe already has).<br /><br />Lots of kudos and four stars for the immense nature of the undertaking itself.nature, not antagonistic.

It isn't.<br /><br />I've been objectively observing the shifting paradigms in the dog training world for nearly thirty years and I've found that there are two major myths out there: 1) that dogs form social hierarchies (they don't*, the pack instinct only exists to enable canines to hunt large prey), and 2) that behavioral science is a real science (it's not--even Keller Breland, after he'd invented clicker training, said \\"There are definite weaknesses in the theory underlying these techniques.\\").<br /><br />And while I'm sure McConnell believes in what she says, and that she's probably a pretty good trainer, in THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH she perpetuates both of these myths.  If she only understood that the prey drive is the organizing principle behind canine social behavior imagine how much better at it she'd be.  (I've used both dominance training and operant conditioning and found nothing works better than play training.)  So by all means read THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH to get McConnell's perspective, but keep what I've said in mind.  And I'd recommend that you also buy a copy of NATURAL DOG TRAINING or PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG, by Patricia Gail Burnham.<br /><br />Still, it's very helpful to have someone with McConnell's background and experience telling dog owners that some of the things they instinctively and unconsciously do as human beings actually send the wrong signal to their dogs (even if McConnell does have a lot of those signals wrong herself).  That's why I'm giving THE OTHER END OF THE LEASH two stars.<br /><br />*Top wolf expert L.

Let me just say up front that this is a wonderful book in many ways, and offers a unique, and in most cases, accurate view of animal consciousness.  My own area of expertise is canine behavior, so I was really looking forward to Temple Grandin's perspective on that.  She's absolutely right when she says that animals are specifically geared toward perceiving vivid sensory details rather than the way the human brain tends to automatically generalize things and gather such details into conceptual, symbolic, or \\"meaningful\\" chunks.<br /><br />I hope all dog owners will read this book and finally realize that their dogs are both \\"smarter\\" and not quite as smart as they thought they were.  I tell my dog training clients that dogs are natural-born geniuses at pattern recognition--which goes beyond the sense of smell, by the way, which Grandin focuses on, and includes visual data (body language) and aural input (vocalizations)--but that they're innately incapable of symbolic, conceptual, or linguistic thought processes.<br /><br />So imagine my disappointment when instead of continuing to break new ground, Grandin and her co-author trot out the washed-up alpha theory* with most, if not all, of its attendant fallacies firmly in place.  Just where I was hoping to get her unique perspective on something truly important (at least to me and the dogs I train), her insight fails her and she falls back on old, outdated, and thoroughly discredited research.<br /><br />This is maddening since her views on aggression are semi-accurate (most aggression in dogs IS based on fear).  But how can she believe in this myth of alpha, especially since she's put forth the position that animals aren't capable of symbolic and conceptual thinking, and for the alpha theory to be true it would require dogs and wolves to be able to think this way?<br /><br />Let me make another thing clear: dogs are not inherently dangerous!  They are genetically programmed to want to attain a state of harmony with other dogs and with people.  It's what they live for.  In fact, this is what the pack instinct is really about since it's what enables canids to hunt large prey, by working together in group harmony.  The primary thing that makes dogs dangerous is the way they've been mistreated by people who've been brainwashed about having to be the dog's pack leader, which has been woefully misused in many cases as an excuse to hurt, scare, intimidate, and punish these innately loving and sweet-natured animals... (whew! -- glad I got that off my chest...)<br /><br />Anyway, that's why I'm only giving this book three stars.  Grandin has done good work, at least partially.  We should all be thankful for her insights and her unique perspective.  Just ignore most of what she says about canine social behavior.<br /><br />*Wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as Dr. L.

I like pets just as much as anyone else, though I don't feel the need to glorify them with powers that their small brains are incapable of possessing.\\"<br /><br />First of all, Stephen Budiansky--whom I admire--thinks dogs are social parasites (though that's not why I admire him; I like his unique approach to the subject matter).  And the truth is, at least one other researcher, who was furiously attempting to discredit Sheldrake's theory (hardly an objective approach), actually ended up replicating his results exactly.<br /><br />And having a small brain has absolutely nothing to do with what Sheldrake posits to be a common biological function of all social animals.  He theorizes that it's a fairly ordinary form of communication that pre-dates human language and which doesn't require any kind of highly developed cognitive architecture.<br /><br />Granted, Sheldrake focused on the dogs who'd been reported to already show this behavior, but the thrust of the research detailed in this book was not to provide definitive proof that dogs are \\"telepathic\\", but to start people thinking in that direction.  And some of the data is quite remarkable.<br /><br />By the way, my dog could care less when I'm coming home.  He's always asleep when I get there (though he's always happy to see me).  But I've had other experiences that show Sheldrake is on the mark. For instance, I found that if I'm walking my dog and thinking about going into a store up the block and picturing the possible behavior in my mind, he'll give up his usual path and pull me toward that store, even if I've changed my mind in the meantime.<br /><br />I've also found that when teaching the down/stay at a distance, followed by the recall, if I imagine the dog coming toward me before I give him the release and the recall signal, he'll almost inevitably break the stay and come running.<br /><br />I'm not a complete moron, so when I first noticed this happening I figured that I must have been doing something with my body language to cause this behavior.  So I very carefully monitored and controlled my posture, my facial expressions (even though I was fifty yards away), etc.  Nope.  It wasn't my body language.<br /><br />Huh, I thought, could it be these mental pictures I'm creating in my mind?  So I trained myself not to create those mental images and whenever I kept my mind blank the dogs inevitably stopped breaking the stay until the release signal was given.<br /><br />These experiences are far from being scientific proof but they do make you think.<br /><br />I also recommend THE PRESENCE OF THE PAST for Sheldrake's theories on morphic fields.bly break the stay and come running.

I admire Jean Donaldson and her ideas.  And what a pleasure it was to read something by a trainer who has a \\"so what?\\" attitude toward the \\"rules\\" about showing your dog you're alpha.  She really sticks it to trainers whose techniques rely too much on the old alpha myth* (which accounts for the two stars, above). But what Donaldson fails to realize is that operant conditioning is almost as big a myth as the alpha theory (which accounts for there only being two stars).<br /><br />One of her main points is that \\"traditional\\" training (meaning dominance) creates negative side-effects, which is the main reason I gave up using those techniques years ago (in 1992) and turned to operant conditioning as a possible alternative.  What I found, though, is that not all behavior can be learned (or unlearned) through conditioning.  I also found that instinctive behaviors tend to override conditioned ones, and that a training system based primarily on food rewards (and by extension, clickers, since their effectiveness is dependant on the association made between the click and being given a food treat) can also create a negative learning experience for a dog.  The truth is, food makes for a great inducement for most behaviors, but it's a rather shaky reinforcement.<br /><br />Someone reading this might say: Wait, go back a second. Did you just say that food rewards create a negative learning experience?  That's impossible to believe.  I mean, after all, it's called positive reinforcement, right?<br /><br />Yes, but \\"operant conditioning\\" works best when you use INTRINSIC REINFORCERS, meaning they're directly related to the behavior being learned.  And food is not directly related to any obedience behavior other than sitting on command, or to a lesser degree to coming when called.  On the other hand, EXTRINSIC REINFORCERS, which is what food usually is, don't work as well.  Not only that but, according to the behavioral textbooks, extrinsic reinforcers can actually undermine the effectiveness of intrinsic reinforcers or just plain ruin the learning process entirely.  How positive is that?<br /><br />Imagine you're a dog and you have strong instincts to chase things and bite them.  That's what really floats your boat.  The dominance trainer says, \\"Don't use your predatory energy or I'll punish you,\\" and the dog learns to obey by repressing those instincts, which leaves him feeling unfulfilled.  The clicker trainer says, \\"There's no need to use that energy-look!  I've got a cookie!\\"  And the dog learns to obey by giving up what he really loves for some instant gratification of a lesser kind.  And although his tummy is now full he still feels empty inside.  A smart trainer would say, \\"What great instincts you have!  Let's play a game that lets you use them by obeying my commands!\\"  And the dog learns to obey because it just feels good, naturally.  He feels totally happy and emotionally fulfilled because the reinforcement is built into the learning process and, thus, into the behavior itself.<br /><br />So, which of these models of learning is really the most positive for the dog?  And which is the most effective?<br /><br />Nobel Prize winning biologist Konrad Lorenz said, \\"All animals learn best through play.\\"  So while I'd read CULTURE CLASH for a fresh viewpoint about dogs, I definitely wouldn't use it as a training manual.  Buy a copy of PLAY TRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, instead.  Or better yet, try the more comprehensive NATURAL DOG TRAINING, by Kevin Behan.  Both methods work via intrinsic reinforcers.  It's kind of like the difference between learning something slowly and painfully by rote, through endless repetitions, and learning it instantly and permanently by being \\"in the zone.\\"<br /><br />*(The top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as Dr. L.

The reason it was so funny at the time is that it was totally absurd.  Nothing like that could ever happen, right?<br /><br />Wrong.  Thanks to Nicholas Dodman and THE DOG WHO LOVED TOO MUCH it's now become a way of life for far too many American dogs and their owners.<br /><br />Granted, when your dog is driving you crazy and you don't know what else to do, Prozac can seem like a godsend.  The only trouble is that nearly all of the behavioral problems Dr. Dodman encounters in the various chapters of this book could have been solved quite easily (okay, maybe \\"fairly\\" easily) with natural dog training techniques, which work not by desensitizing the dog to emotional triggers in the environment, but by resensualizing him, meaning by putting his instincts BACK INTO BALANCE with his environment.  (The only exception is a dog who exhibits OCD, as this is a definite neurological problem, not just a behavioral one.)<br /><br />And another thing, in my fifteen years as a dog trainer in New York City, I've yet to see operant conditioning techniques, like the ones Dodman uses in this book, attain more than 15 to 20 percent effectiveness with any of the behavioral problems it's used on.  (This marked lack of success is, sadly, the main reason behaviorists are prescribing drugs more and more often.)  Dodman seems to have had even less than a 15% success ratio, though that could just be a result of his presenting the hardest cases to the reader in order to explain the necessity for these dogs to be put on psychotropic drugs.  And by the way, why do these drugs only work for about three months or so before the behavior re-presents itself or worsens?<br /><br />And since Dodman (or his publishers) deliberately misused the word \\"love\\" in his title in order to sell more books, my last question is this: wouldn't it be great if Dodman loved dogs half as much as he loves drugs?uch as he loves drugs?	2005-08-11

I think this book was actually first published in 1980 or 82, when the idea of playing tug was strictly verboten in most dog training circles.  In fact, I'd venture to say that nearly all dog trainers at the time, particularly pet dog trainers, would've told you not to play it with your dog.  Now here we are, 23 years later (in 2005), and I can't tell you how many of my potential clients, when I ask them during a phone consultation if they play tug with their pups, still say no, they don't because they heard it causes aggression.  Or they say, yes, they do, but they were told to never let the dog win because winning will make him think he's alpha.<br /><br />WRONG: tug-of-war doesn't cause aggression; it's actually a safe outlet for it.  Plus, truly aggressive dogs don't even like to play tug.  And the truth is, if you can finally get them to play with you, you'll find that they're much less aggressive if not over their aggression entirely!  (It's kinda funny how that's just the opposite of what we've all been told, huh?)  And then there's the fact that it's one of the best training tools ever invented because it stimulates a dog's desire to learn and obey to the highest possible level.<br /><br />As for a dog thinking he's alpha, that's bunk.  To quote ex-cop turned dog trainer Jack Field (who's the fictional narrator of my detective novels), \\"Dogs don't care who's alpha and who's not.

The Ineffective Art of Teaching and Training	I love the title of this book.<br /><br />The contents, however, perpetuate the mythology of behavioral science as an actual science that always and inevitably works to change, shape, or modify behavior.  It's not, and it doesn't.  In fact, in my opinion it has become more like a belief system--based on a tautology*--where despite mounting evidence of its overall ineffectiveness, particularly when it comes to solving behavioral problems in dogs (which is my own area of expertise, and where it only works about 15% of the time), its adherents continue to tout it as highly successful.  They also wrongly claim that ALL dog training takes place through some form of operant conditioning, whether the trainer is aware of it or not.  (Most dog training is actually closer to respondent than to operant conditioning, but that's another topic**.)<br /><br />Still, Pryor makes a convincing argument for applying the ideas of B. F. Skinner to everything from dolphin training to the little problems of everyday life, even though the preponderance of Skinner's ideas have been proven invalid.  Even Skinner's student Keller Breland, who invented clicker training and later became Pryor's mentor, sadly discovered that, \\"There are definite weaknesses in the philosophy underlying these techniques.\\"  (\\"Behavior Problems in Organisms,\\" American Psychologist, 1961.)<br /><br />I have to admit, though, even I was suckered in by Pryor's fervent belief in conditioning when I first read this book.  She has that effect on people.  And, energized by her passion, I began using her ideas in my dog training practice in New York City.  I quickly found out, though, that conditioning techniques are mostly ineffective, and that, believe it or not, using food rewards can actually cause a negative learning experience for the dog, because it isn't intrinsic to learning most of the behaviors a dog needs to learn.***<br /><br />However, I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from buying and reading this book.  I think you should look at behavior from all possible angles and carefully consider all sides of an issue.  But if you DO read it, my suggestion would be take what Pryor says with a very large grain of salt.  And if you're interested in really new ideas about dog training, there are a couple of books I do recommend, and highly: PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, and NATURAL DOG TRAINING by Kevin Behan.  (Don't be fooled by the publication dates of these books; the ideas in them are still fresh and new.)<br /><br />*The Primary Behavioristic Tautology:<br />What is a reinforcement?  Anything that causes a behavior to be learned.  What is a learned behavior?  Anything that has been reinforced.  That's circular logic.<br /><br />** An operant is a behavior which is spontaneously emitted, with no stimulus coming from an outside source.  A respondent is a behavior that is elicited or induced by a stimulus coming from an outside source (such as a dog trainer).  So, very little of what a dog trainer does could be correctly termed operant conditioning.<br /><br />*** According to behaviorists, intrinsic reinforcers work better than extrinsic reinforcers.  And food is, generally speaking, an extrinsic reinforcer since it's not directly related to the behaviors being learned in dog training.  Another point is that extrinsic reinforcers, such as food rewards (and by extension, clickers, which get their effectiveness from the association a dog makes with being fed), have a tendency to actually undermine the learning process entirely.

This woman is a damn fine writer and I don't care who knows it!<br /><br />The reason I've given my review the title I have is that I just read a couple of the reviews from readers here who found THIS DOG FOR HIRE boring!  This is incomprehensible to me.  I've read a lot of mystery novels and very few authors have the kind of power to pull me into a story the way Benjamin does.  And the only thing I can think to say to those readers is that this book probably has a bit more \\"Dash\\" (double meaning) than they're probably used to.  It is superbly written.<br /><br />So, if you like dogs, and you like tough female detectives who have a wry sense of humor, especially about themselves, I think you'll really like this book.<br /><br />A first-rate first novel from a truly first-rate mystery novelist.	2005-08-10

That night I ordered a copy from Amazon.<br /><br />When the book arrived I found out I wasn't wrong.  Emergence theory is, to my way of thinking, one of the most interesting scientific developments of the last fifty years.  And Johnson explains it (albeit somewhat superficially) in a way that makes sense to the average (or maybe above average) reader.<br /><br />As a dog trainer, who for the last fifteen years or so has had trouble buying the alpha theory of canine behavior, I knew the idea that some systems are smarter than the sum of their parts might explain why so many otherwise intelligent people believe that dogs and wolves are capable of abstract, conceptual, and symbolic thinking (which they'd have to be in order for the alpha theory to make any sense).  For instance, some alpha theorists are now sayiing there isn't just one alpha wolf, but several, depending on what the pack is doing at any given moment.  This contradicts the entire idea of an alpha wolf, or top dog, or pack leader.  Yet when you look at the phenomenon through emergence theory (at least as Johnson explains it), you begin to recognize that the pack's structure changes organically -- from the bottom up, not the top down -- in order to deal with the changing needs of the system as a whole.  The pack has no hierarchical structure at all!  (This has been borne out recently by research done by L. David Mech, studying wild wolf behavior, and by McNutt and Boggs, studying the wild dogs of Africa.)<br /><br />I realize my take on the subject is very narrowly defined, particularly in this review.  But like Johnson I studied semiotics in college (as a film major) and can see how knowing that emergent systems are operating all around us, whether you see this by watching a group of dogs at the dog run, or by noticing the subtle shifts that take place over time in your own neighborhood, or by analyzing the entire zeitgeist itself -- it's very compelling way of thinking and a lot of fun.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, not only here, but in the Suggested Reading list in the backs of all my novels!by noticing the subtle shifts that take place over time in your own neighborhood, or by analyzing the entire zeitgeist itself -- it's very compelling way of thinking and a lot of fun. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, not only here, but in the Suggested Reading list in the backs of all my novels!	2005-08-10

At the time I read it I had been looking for an approach to dog training that didn't rely on the harsh corrections recommended by proponents of the alpha theory, which were all the rage at the time. Campbell was only the second author I read who claimed that the alpha theory wasn't relevant to training.  (Kevin Behan, author of NATURAL DOG TRAINING, 1992, was the other.)  What's even more brilliant is that Campbell wrote his book in the 1970s, long before we all found out that the alpha theory is a total myth! (The top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as Dr. L. David Mech puts it, \\"it falsely implies a hierarchical system in which each wolf assumes a place in a linear pecking order,\\" (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002).)<br /><br />I especially like Campbell's \\"jolly routine\\" exercise and his distraction/praise approach to stopping a puppy from doing natural, though destructive, behaviors, as opposed to using physical corrections or scolding the pup.<br /><br />That said, I've found that many of the other exercises-like \\"no free lunch\\" (now called NILIF)-don't really work.  And some-like the exercise for keeping the dog from going through a door ahead of you-are completely unnecessary.  That's why I'm only giving BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN DOGS three stars.  It's still worth reading though, especially if you're a dog trainer.	2005-08-10

When the monks ask how hard you should hit your dog (that's right -- how hard should you hit your dog?), they reply, \\"IF SHE DOESN'T YELP IN PAIN YOU HAVEN'T HIT HER HARD ENOUGH.\\" (pg. 44, original edition)  That's all you and your dog need to know.  And while there may be some valid information in this book, it doesn't amount to anything you can't find in many other books on the subject--books that don't recommend you hit your dog till she yelps in pain.  The kind of mentality that could even remotely consider hitting a dog in order to discipline it for ANYTHING simply can't be trusted, and should qualify this as one of the worst books on dog training ever written.<br /><br />As far as solving behavioral problems is concerned, most of them, including aggression, are caused by mistreatment in the first place.  So how does further mistreatment help an already distressed animal learn?  Of course if you still believe in the now discredited alpha theory*, then perhaps this Draconian approach makes sense to you.  But since the alpha theory has been proven false*, physical discipline of this type ends up just being stupid, mean, harmful, and--though I hate to say it--slightly insane.  There ARE better, much kinder, and more humane ways to deal with problem dogs (and I don't mean drugs or behavioral \\"science\\" techniques).<br /><br />My recommendation for a dog training manual?  Either PLAY TRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, or NATURAL DOG TRAINING by Kevin Behan.  Or both.<br /><br />*(Top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as Dr. L. David Mech puts it, \\"it falsely implies a hierarchical system in which each wolf assumes a place in a linear pecking order.\\" (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002)  Translation: there is no hierarchy in wolf packs, which puts the lie to the monks' entire approach to canine behavior and training.)	2005-08-10

For instance, in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they can't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin.  The first is clearly way beyond a dog's capacity, while the second is something which comes totally natural to them.  How did Coren get things so backwards?<br /><br />And the \\"intelligence\\" tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test (or game) while you're doing it.  For instance, I tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel, then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat.  I'd still be waiting if I hadn't decided he'd never look under that towel.  Then I tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys.  Then I hid it under the towel, and it took him less than a second to get that toy.  So my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of Coren's intelligence spectrum.  (This is just one example, by the way: the whole idea of testing a dog's IQ like this is bogus.)<br /><br />And don't get me started on Coren's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth.  Granted, he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy, or an alpha wolf, or the rest of that alpha nonsense.  Though, I doubt if even that data would change Coren's mind.  After all, he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly \\"signifies submission to the pack leader.\\"  (Really?  Dogs use \\"signifiers\\" now?)<br /><br />The funny thing is, shortly after reading that passage I saw a wolf documentary on TV and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what Coren recommends!  He rolled over on HIS back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose!  They loved it!  So I tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog--an alpha male, if there ever was one--and HE loved it.  And later that night, on our last walk, he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before I'd mimicked the papa wolf's behavior.  Again, Coren had everything exactly backwards to reality.<br /><br />This \\"through the looking glass\\" quality persists throughout the book, with Coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical, symbolic, and conceptual thinking.  Wha..?  I'm sorry.  I love dogs and I think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected, but the abilities they DO have are geared for being a dog, not a mini-me with four legs and a tail.  For one thing, fully one third of a dog's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information, and none to processing symbols and concepts.  I think Coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book.t the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose!
