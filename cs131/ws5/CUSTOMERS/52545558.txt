War gives expression to our fears, our bloodlust and our inability to fully control this world. We are weak and often corrupt beings. And yet, the human face of war often hides behind body counts, sweeping statements for and against the war, and endless ideologies.<br /><br />In the Purple Sun, Lawrence McAuliffe returns us to the human story revealed in the midst and as a consequence of war. Along the way, he weaves a tale of redemption. On the surface it is the redemption story of one soldier, but it actually explores redemption in multiple lives and possibly even hints at a redemptive path for two nations.<br /><br />While this is not a theological treatise on redemption, McAuliffe  does wrestle deeply with the cost and quest of human redemption. Without being preachy, McAuliffe raises pointed questions about penance, the role of relationships in redemption, and the place of suffering in our lives.<br /><br />God is not directly in the story, but His presence haunts the tale in the midst of human frailty, in the memories of the characters, and persistant calling to follow a path that leads each person to face their own demons.<br /><br />May the tale haunt all its readers with the Sacred Presence.	2005-10-06

Peter Wittstock calls the American church to awaken from cultural complacency and live out the reality of the gospel. Taking the message of Jesus Christ seriously, Wittstock offers a comprehensive catalogue of Jesus' commands.<br /><br />While Christians often claim to trust in Jesus and worship him, Wittstock challenges us to listen to him and obey him. Instead of cute cliches and catchy slogans, he offers the words of Jesus.<br /><br />I personally like to use a variety of spiritual exercises as part of my devotional life. While Wittstock does not neccesarily introduce this book as such, it lends itself to spiritual exercises. I would recomend readers read only one command a day. Then meditate on the command and reflect on the relation of the command to their own life. This time of reflection can naturally lead into a time of prayer and possible insight about how this might be realized in their own life.<br /><br />While I appreciate Wittstock's work and recomend it, I do have one caveat. He comes down hard on \\"free grace\\" in his introduction. He even quotes a variety of Reformed writers (inlcuding John Calvin) to build his case for a life of holiness. Unfortuantely, he does not present a cogent argument on the relation of grace to the life of holiness.<br /><br />From a Covenantal perspective, grace is a prerequisite for holiness and the only means to realize the life of holiness. Without a proper foundation of covenant and grace, a call to holiness can easily become another system of human centered righteousness. I would balance his introduction with covenantal perspectives from the writers he quotes like John Calvin or Francis Schaeffer or more contemporary works like Jerry Bridges' The Pursuit of Holiness or Joel Beeke's Overcoming the World.	2005-08-03

A vision of the God who is always greater.	Staniloae is simply breathtaking. He holds the tensions of Christian faith in a beautiful harmony. For instance, his discussion of the cataphatic and apophatic way of spiritual life is the best treatment I have ever read on the topic. It steers away from what he considers to be a Westernized understanding of negative theology which borders on agnosticism. Staniloae presents a relational God who creates time and space for man's place of movement toward intimacy with God. Staniloae's thought is particularly relevant in this postmodern age. He would be interesting to read in conjunction with Colin Gunton, Stanley Grentz, Thomas Torrance, or other Trinitarian theologians.	2003-05-27

Even though the title is &quot;The Celtic Soul Friend,&quot; the topic of soul friends only recieves focused in attention in the last chapter. The rest of the book is primarily an introduction to Celtic Spirituality from Sellner's point of view. Sellner's approach is between academic and devotional but he leans toward the devotional. Thus the book avoids addressing many of the critical arguments surrounding the historicity of Celtic Spirituality. In spite of the sparse treatment of soul friends, the book still has merit, presenting a vision of soul friends that is beyond simply glorified mentors to a dynamic of relationship that flows in both directions.	2003-05-27

Some people are called to a life of pure faith where they will only know the darkness of God. Others are called to a life fo pure love where the will often experience God's presence. Caussade says that both paths can be equal before God. The challenge of following Christ is not to replicate another's experience but to allow the Holy Spirit to guide me. I learn to yield to God's divine will in each moment. This book should never be confused with quietism, which suggest I can do nothing but wait before God. Caussade suggests some are called to active lives and some are called to lives of stillness. We are all called to pursue the Lord by yielding to the SPirit in the present moment. I find this book an excellent companion to Martin Buber's I and Thou.	2001-04-08

For example, the character Lilly is based on the ancient Jewish legend of Lillith (in the mythic stories it is Lillith, not Eve who is responsible for the fall of man). The story operates on multiple levels and challenged me to think about ideas I never considered. I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, but as with all Williams novels, there are some passages are a bit too obscure and philosophical for a novel. Anyone interested in mystical ideas should read Charles Williams. While his primary interest was in the Christian divine romance (as revealed in Dante's Beatrice), Williams also had interests in Jewish mysticism, Sufi Mysticism, and other darker areas. His deep intellect and ability to see both sides of an idea make his writing fuller and richer than virtually any &quot;spiritual novels&quot; (Christian or otherwise) on the market today.	2001-01-31

I honestly think Buber wrote it poetically to encourage the reader to slow down and potentially I have a true encounter  with the ideas. Most of Buber's later books seem to be developing the ideas  expounded in I and Thou, so it might be helpful to read another Buber text,  like Between Man and Man, alongside I and Thou.
