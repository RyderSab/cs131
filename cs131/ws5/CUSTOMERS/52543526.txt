I have skimmed (not read) ALL of the Sano Ichiro novels.<br /><br />Assassin's Touch is typical: I can enjoy the first 20 pages, enjoying the characters and the period atmosphere. But then the unconvincing plot is introduced and I see where it's going to go all hooey. So I jump to the last 30 pages to read through the breathless chase/fight/showdown scene, and get to the happy ending. Not even a hint of curiosity to go back and read to fill in the narrative middle.<br /><br />I love medieval samurai period stories but these are just too painful to fully immerse myself in. The characters are shallow and this makes the plots unconvincing. It's just not convincing after reading novels like Shogun. These characters have no \\"smarts\\" and are like little automatons with little automaton motivations. It's like watching Ricky and Lucy (from I Love Lucy) trying to play lead roles in War and Peace.<br /><br />On the other hand, I may be taking things too seriously here. If you like short sentences and flowery, over the top simplification and dramatics, and lead characters having ridiculous near-death experiences and hostage situations, then these books might be of interest.<br /><br />Rowland has done well with this series and I will still skim each book that comes out. What can I say, I'm hooked on samurai.	2005-10-10

Owls Well that Ends Well is a cheerful mystery story written with a deft touch. Meg Landslow, the lead character, is a strong, competent, pragmatic soul. She is fiercely loyal to her significant other, Michael, and is surrounded by eccentric relatives and town characters.<br /><br />The plot and characterizations are hilarious. The background for this story is Meg's organization of a giant yard sale, which provides for many comedic opportunities, including unscrupulous antique dealers, combative curio seekers, helpful and not so helpful helpers, and more.	2005-09-01

If you are fortunate enough to have come across John Ringo's Human Posleen War series (4 novels), you already know his particular genius for comedic, military, upbeat science fiction. If not, you are fortunate to have these to look forward to reading.<br /><br />\\"Through the Looking Glass\\" is a standalone novel that takes place in the contemporary United States. The human and alien characters are completely different from the Posleen series, but the writing, humor, characterization, plot twists, and sci-fi macguffinery are just as top notch.<br /><br />I hope Ringo keeps this up. The Posleen series puts him right up there with Keith Laumer (Bolo), Larry Niven (Man Kzinn), and David Drake (Hammer's Slammers) as having established a whole new genre of military sci-fi. Who knew it could be in comedy?!	2005-08-27

Modesitt's \\"ethics\\" sci-fi novels include the Parafaith (religion) and Ecolitan (ecology) series. I read \\"Ethos Effect\\" a second time for enjoyment and to check again, was Modesitt advocating a particular morality?<br /><br />I like the novel for several reasons. It clearly proposes an ethical dilemma: Is there an absolute morality that everyone must follow, or is there an individual morality each person must follow on their own, at the risk that they are just personally justifying what to others are clearly immoral actions?<br /><br />In this novel, the hero accomplishes what he sets out to do by acting several times according to the operational premise, \\"it's better that some die now in order that more live in the future\\". But the plot line requires the hero to continually reflect on, be responsible for, and clean up after the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />Modesitt's main message is being responsible and accountable for one's choices in life, whatever they are. But it's told in the context of a rousing interstellar conflict, with excerpts from a sort of \\"encyclopedia galactica\\" discussing ethics, giving the book a stature reminiscent of Frank Herbert's Dune series,	2005-08-25

I read this book because I wanted to learn more about the history of the American economy.<br /><br />The author, John Ehrman, focuses on changes in domestic policies, politics, and quality of life particularly associated with President Reagan's years in office, 1981 to 1989. Ehrman includes substantial material on changes prior and subsequent to these years, so the continuity to present-day circumstances is excellent.<br /><br />Ehrman helps Americans see themselves from a broader perspective, for example, that on the whole, Americans prefer workable ideas vs. ideologies, and gradual change vs. extremes. A key dynamic for this preference is that second and third generation immigrants of all origins experience improved education, leading to improved work opportunities, leading to improved quality of life, leading to preferring policies that promote economic stability.<br /><br />The author appears to be neo-conservative (moderate) in point of view but I found the book sympathetic and comprehensive in coverage of liberal vs. conservative, moderate vs. extreme, and other contrasting points of view. In fact I found it quite instructive understanding and sorting out these points of view.<br /><br />I concur with the author's assertion that most Americans are centrist and gradual. His work helps us see the actions of President Reagan's administration that worked and the actions that didn't work in building consensus and making successful progress.	2005-08-13

Just finished \\"Musclebound\\", having previously read \\"Monkey Wrench\\" (reviewed separately). I am even more confirmed liking this character and series.<br /><br />Eva Wylie is an unusual character, to say the least, and I won't go into the plots as these are available in the other reviews. It's the character that appeals.<br /><br />The novels are told in first-person narrative. You feel like an older, wiser counselor looking over Eva's shoulder, being inside her head. You see what's going on WELL before Eva does, like when she finds a bag full of money in this story but does not realize it's counterfeit 'til WAY after the reader does.<br /><br />It's not about how smart Eva is, but how gutsy. She's been knocked down over and over but she gets back up every time. By the end of each novel Eva has grown a bit further by paradoxically staying herself AND learning some things new. Eva has friends and supporters both true (including THE ENEMY, her nickname for another character in the book) and false (but we're still figuring that out along with her).<br /><br />It's a wild and crazy ride, each novel, and I can't wait to read the next!	2005-08-12

Great to have these three novels collected in one place. I am a David Drake fan and especially like his Hammer's Slammers and Leary and Mundy RCN series. But I've found Drake's non-series books to consistently stand on their own merits, and they give me more to read by this excellent author.<br /><br />\\"The Reaches\\" comprise 3 experiments by Drake on a common theme. It's Elizabethan England in space. Drake's forward warns readers of the seeming incongruity of troops traveling by starship but still using single-fire weapons. That said, having read all three novels, it works.<br /><br />The first novel, \\"Igniting the Reaches\\", is the most grim in tone and chaotic in plot. But the tone is no more grim than in Hammer's Slammers, and the plot chaos is true to the feel I get when reading 1500's history. The lead characters are Piet Ricimer, a charismatic leader, and Stephen Gregg, a cold-eyed killer who absolutely supports Ricimer. Ironically, Gregg is the more sympathetic of the two characters, as he struggles with his growing ability to be ruthless, whereas Ricimer remains the same master planner and visionary throughout the book.<br /><br />In the second novel, \\"Through the Breach\\", Drake adds a third character, Jeremy Cooke, who tells the story in first person narrative and gives an outsider's look at Ricimer and Gregg. The plot now focuses on the growing conflict between two space nations as Jeremy comes to manhood.<br /><br />In the closing novel, \\"Fireships\\", narrative returns to third person. Jeremy disappears from the main story and a new character, Sally Blythe, captain of a merchant starship, is introduced. Competent and forthright, Blythe picks up where Cooke left, working to help Ricimer and Gregg defeat the Federation. The story ends with victory for Venus and a burgeoning love interest between Sally and Stephen Gregg. All four characters across the three novels come out alive and with prospects for remaining well.<br /><br />David Drake indicates he modeled Ricimer on Sir Francis Drake (no relation!) and Gregg on one of Francis's best friends. To me this is of bookish interest only, as it in no way interfered with a trio of rousing good stories. The most sympathetic characters to me are the three who assist Ricimer, rather than Ricimer himself.he modeled Ricimer on Sir Francis Drake (no relation!) and Gregg on one of Francis's best friends.

Savvy citizen investors and consumers need to understand economics and the economy, and Gordon definitely helps us do that.<br /><br />Major strengths in this book:<br /><br />* How the original American colonies were established and grew economically. Have NEVER seen this material so well put together. It's an economic genealogy of the states.<br /><br />* How changes in transportation and manufacturing impacted economic development (rivers and canals, steamboats and railroads, steam engines and cotton gins, etc.) LOTS of insight here.<br /><br />* How the American economy went through not one or two but many recurring depressions over time. Good treatment of differing policies of presidents and congresses. Good treatment of historical conflict about having a central Bank of the United States. IMPORTANT changes in American mindset here.<br /><br />* Good review of changes in money. This was a wild and crazy topic in American practice.<br /><br />* How the American economy went from few to many stockholders. Good treatment of changes in regulation and deregulation.<br /><br />* Good start on oil. How it came in. How it became dominant.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />* Depth of treatment suffers after Reagan era. No mention of Clinton or Bush(es) even though book is copyright 2004.<br /><br />* The switch from nuts and bolts topics like steam engines to abstract topics like fiscal policy could use more elaboration. This is a valuable and critical point he's making in the history of the country's mindset and it needs more treatment.<br /><br />* Treatment of computers and internet lacks subtle analysis and is \\"gee whiz\\" - would like the author to apply same depth of thinking here as he applied discussing impacts of earlier technologies.<br /><br />Author's bias?<br /><br />There is a bit of \\"rah rah\\" especially at the end, however it is not a major distraction.<br /><br />The comprehensiveness and insightfulness of the material from Colonization through Reaganization is excellent.

More than that, his mechanism has the potential to be built electronically into helpful intelligent machine applications. His exposition on his model of intelligence is quite readable and he makes technical points using everyday examples that leave you going, oh, so THAT'S what's going on.<br /><br />Hawkins explains how he moved from practical computer science (co-founder of the PalmPilot) to practical brain science (founder of Redwood Neuroscience Institute) and invites young people in high school and college to jump on board. He communicates freshness and excitement about creating a new thing in the world that I last experienced reading the biograpy of Amazon.com founder, Jeff Bezos.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone interested in how intelligence works, whether it's to better understand people, design cool new technology, or just because.	2005-08-02

I picked this book to read because the opening pages establish Rachel, the main character, as a strong, independent, female lead. The book opens with Rachel changing a flat for a (male) client in the parking garage she owns. The client is soon dead and the mystery commences.<br /><br />This was NOT a book I felt comfortable settling into to read. We are soon told Rachel has a chequered past. Her mother is dead and her father is a compulsive gambler. She is running a garage because that is all she has. Boom - that's the end of the character development for Rachel!<br /><br />From then on it's a frantic pace of plot twists, accumulations of allies out of nowhere on one meeting's notice, and a series of bizarre events, chases, and further deaths.<br /><br />Penny Rudolph DOES succeed in keeping you guessing what's really going on. Rachel herself takes awhile to catch on.<br /><br />What I liked about this book was the background of the water politics and conflicts between farmers, government agencies, and environmentalists.<br /><br />What I wished about this book was more convincing characters, character interrelations, and plot twists.

Many people know the controversy of Darwin's law of evolution in the life sciences. There is similar controversy of the law of entropy in the physical sciences. Both controversies stem from the late 1800's and have to do with opinions about the hand of God vs. Nature. This book highlights the fascinating human and technical issues at the beginning of the theory of entropy.<br /><br />In Boltzmann's Atom the author presents the story of Ludwig Boltzmann, Viennese physicist. Although several key scientists progressed the theories of Thermodynamics (heat movement), Boltzmann was the one who firmed up its theoretical mathematical foundation by linking it with physics mechanics models. The relevance of the word \\"Atom\\" in the title relates to the mechanics model... at the time, many physicists did not believe there were such things as (invisible) atoms and molecules bumping around energetically causing heat and temperature and pressure effects.<br /><br />What really threw Boltzmann's contemporaries, and what Boltzmann himself did not really \\"get\\", was that his use of STATISTICAL equations foreshadowed the new probabilistic nature of the laws of physics. In a few decades this would hit with a bang with quantum mechanics, where even Einstein weighed in protestingly against \\"God playing dice\\".<br /><br />I liked that I learned from this book more about the contemporary physicists in the late 1800's (which included James Clerk Maxwell of Maxwell's Equations and Max Planck of Planck's Constant) and what they worked on and argued about. I'm sad that Boltzmann suicided at the age of 62 and did not stick around a bit to see the tremendous impact his work has had on modern physics.<br /><br />One other point stands clear relevant to evolution and entropy: There are discussions in SCIENCE and there are discussions in PHILOSOPHY, and there is VALUE in keeping DISTINCT what kind of discussion you are having!	2005-07-23

But it could be (think Dune or Star Wars and the ups and downs of their Empires).<br /><br />The book is a series of stories, told as if spoken live by a storyteller, about different characters, emperors, empresses, soldiers, cities at different times in the history of an unspecified great Empire.<br /><br />It appeals to me because it is quirky. It reads eloquently but non-colloquially (it is translated). Yet the language is quite elegant and poetic. The tone and feel of the language appeal to me as much as the stories.<br /><br />The storyteller, also unnamed, is a bit of a character, admonishing his (or her) listeners (us) to pay attention, or otherwise chastising them. But it all works. There's something timeless and fascinating about our interest in great Empires. The stories cover millenia of years and rulers, during which time the Empire rises and falls many times. The storyteller is a bit of a cynic and makes side comments during the narratives.<br /><br />It is fascinating and engaging and I am glad I found it. The author is Latin American, which surprised me because the stories felt old European or Slavic at times, or Oriental or maybe Roman. The very essence of Empire comes through.	2005-07-23

These novels feature an engaging, independent, very feminine, very ambition-driven journalism/television writer/producer/\\"talent\\" named Sally Harrington. At first I thought each novel (there are 5 so far) would be an independent episode in Sally's life. But the stories build an accumulating overall story about how Sally gains increasing professional recognition and opportunities while (ahem) exploring what type of man she wants in her long-term love life and (very busy life!) simultaneously doing battle with bad guys in organized crime. The plots are intricate with some bad guys becoming good guys and vice versa.<br /><br />There is plenty of action (sexual as well as fighting) and somehow in all of it there are repeating human touches that I MIGHT have called \\"chick lit\\" EXCEPT I'm a guy and I like the touches... for example, when characters talk about career choices, family etc.<br /><br />So in today's culture I find Sally Harrington an engaging feminine character that men can identify with as well as women. She is successful in a profession where competence, ambition, and beauty are requisites just to get in the game.<br /><br />My only complaint with \\"Kill Fee\\" is that I have to wait for the next installment, and having checked out Laura Van Wormer's web site, find that she's writing some OTHER book first. Well, I suppose I could read the OTHER things she's written, now that I discovered Sally...	2005-07-22

I read this book because I am fascinated by words and dialects and how (some) linguistics experts can tell where you grew up just from the way you speak.<br /><br />\\"Do You Speak American\\" satisfied my craving to learn more about dialect in the United States but it went WAY beyond my expectations.<br /><br />In addition to presenting and discussing a FASCINATING map of major dialect regions and changes in the U.S., this book addresses two key current social issues: The (unfounded) phobia that Spanish will take over from English as the dominant language of the United States, and the (still valid) issue that even as \\"African American English\\" contributes to our culture, it separates many kids from economic mainstream access through linquistic prejudice (e.g., \\"if you sound like THAT you must be DUMB\\")<br /><br />The book doesn't stop there but continues addressing MORE fascinating topics including the origins of \\"Valley Girl/Surfer Dude\\" California dialects (like, totally!) and computer speech recognition efforts by BMW and Microsoft.<br /><br />I found the overall tone of the book UPBEAT. The research findings and interpretations presented show it's quite possible and quite HUMAN to be \\"bilingual\\" in DIALECTS as well as languages.

I read this book because I am interested in explanations of differences and similarities in females and males that can be SUBSTANTIATED (repeatable experimental results and accurate predictions). This book talks about experimental results, observations, and explanations of sexual behavior and sexual change in fish, frogs, hyenas, baboons, and (somewhat) humans.<br /><br />I gave this book 4 stars because I think it could have been further edited for clarity. Its strengths are that it cites lots of fascinating experimental results and shows where popular explanations for sex differences ARE and ARE NOT substantiated.<br /><br />Its weakness is that it could have been better edited before release to a popular audience. My pet peeves were: straightening out the missequenced footnotes in Chapter 2 (\\"Orgasm\\"), and summarizing the author's key points in each chapter in ONE PLACE, versus repeating them in the middle of long discussions that are tortuous to follow.<br /><br />The discussions include both EVIDENCE and DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS and it's easy to get a bit lost on what the author is arguing FOR, factually, vs. FOR, explanation wise. It reminds me of listening to (or reading the book by) a brilliant professor who's going just a LEETLE fast for (me) the student.<br /><br />NEVERTHELESS... It's GOOD STUFF. I think this is a critically important, early book in the emerging field of evolutionary developmental biology and I recommend reading it ANYWAY. It cites EVIDENCE and demonstrates critical thinking to counter/filter/evaluate sex difference evidence and interpretations now and in the future.<br /><br />NOTE: An easier to follow book regarding how organisms evolve is \\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\\" (reviewed separately), but this book doesn't address the sex evolution issues.<br /><br />NOTE: An example of a book clearly explaining and summarizing competing scientific explanations vs. evidence is \\"Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe\\" (reviewed separately), but this book is about physics not biology.tely), but this book is about physics not biology.	2005-07-17

I also highly recommend her earlier \\"Chanur\\" series and even earlier Cyteen and Tripoint universe novels.<br /><br />First, I like Foreigner because the human hero, Bren, finds himself ambassador to an alien culture which is MORE POWERFUL than his native human home. His profession is to \\"think alien\\", and his struggle and success to do so are instructive. I don't know where Cherryh finds her inspiration, but in my own mind I think of the Atavi as a kind of a Imperial-Chinese or Machiavellian-Viennese Empire that WON, and the human colony on the planet as a kind of Western Empire that became stranded and has had to operate from a position of weakness rather than strength. So Bren, the human hero, has to learn and think \\"Atavi\\", helping the current ruler and his consort and family sustain dominancy, while dealing with two other human factions with competing agendas.<br /><br />One thing that comes clear in the series, to me at least, is that different human factions can be JUST as alien to each other as to a \\"true\\" alien society. So the principles Bren must establish and follow as translator/ambassador are a text for relating between different human as well as alien societies.<br /><br />What keeps me coming back are Bren's succeeding despite ever-new obstacles and challenges, and the forging of respect and regard between members of different alien races thinking in wildly different cultures and mindsets. One feels a great deal of affection for the Atavi key players as this remarkable series unfolds.	2005-07-12

This is the first Neal Asher book I've read and I look forward  to reading more. \\"The Skinner\\" caught my fascinated interest with several themes and multiple characters and storylines.<br /><br />If humans could be truly long-lived, how would they deal with getting BORED? The inhabitants of the Skinner world include human \\"old captains\\" who \\"live into the calm\\". The \\"juniors\\" who crew with them are those who've only lived a few centuries!<br /><br />The native life of the Skinner world is anything BUT calm. Is there something beyond mindless feeding frenzies up and down the food chain of life?<br /><br />There's an overall plot with a satisfactory conclusion. It comprises MULTIPLE story lines and characters, including men, women, articial intelligences, and aliens. These characters are variously heroes, bad guys, really bad guys, and ones you're not quite sure about.<br /><br />There's plenty of humor in the narrative. I like it because it's a complex, humorous, planetary narrative that includes just a bit of thinking. I guess I'd tell more of the story line but what mattered to me most is the creative structure and good-natured feel of this book.	2005-07-07

I've read every Meredith Gentry and Anita Blake novel written by Laurell Hamilton to date. There is SOMETHING she's working out in these stories that addresses life, death, power, women and men. It keeps me coming back for more.<br /><br />Be warned, these are SERIES... I read the first 50 pages of Stroke of Midnight, then jumped to the last 50 pages to see where THIS installment would end, then jumped back to the middle and read the whole book.<br /><br />Each chapter and novel move Princess Meredith further and further along in her relationships with her guards, her Aunt the Queen, and her many enemies AND supporters.<br /><br />There is PLENTY OF SEX... I would call it soft porn, written by a women from a woman's point of view (lots of description of clothing and hair, for example!). But explicit enough for a man's point of view. Meredith is a fertility deity, entity, whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />But there is also a progression of power... in Meredith AND in her colleagues, allies, and lovers.<br /><br />Fascinating to note that the Meredith Gentry novels are about fertility and birth, and the Anita Blake novels are about the dead and dying. But BOTH are about POWER and especially about the power of WOMEN with respect to the power of men. They are also about the nature and ethos of power... which is part of the fascination that keeps me coming back.	2005-07-07

Roger Penrose requires STRATEGY to read, but he's SO good... I read this book because I read his Emperor's New Mind earlier, from which new ideas about entropy and consciousness stuck with me since. (He's particularly interested in a substantive science of consciousness and willing to go after major changes in theories to get there!)<br /><br />Reading Penrose requires a STRATEGY. I was DISMAYED at the size of the book but trudged in to start at the beginning... soon I changed... I marked certain SECTIONS to read, jumping about, including cosmology, string theory and entropy. I found this worked MUCH better and stuck with it and was so rewarded I went back and read again Emperor's New Mind.<br /><br />Penrose really thinks and thinks HARD about physics and math and life and consciousness and thought and reality. I've read that even physicists he disagrees with like him for his cheerful challenges to think. I wish he'd taught my college classes in physics... I KNEW things weren't as clear as the texts seemed to imply, and Penrose puts his finger on key issues in quantum mechanics and classical mechanics even as he cheerfully admits his OWN Twistor theories are incomplete. This man ENJOYS science and life and it's contagious.<br /><br />I recommend reading Penrose ALONG WITH other popular treatments (by physicists) of cosmology and entropy etc. Where they'll hit the surface and subsurface, he'll get at the MEAT. I've read complaints that Penrose makes the same points in his different books. My experience is that he makes them better and more clearly as he goes along. I suspect he is a major influence on new scientists (and old) to keep minds open and not lose track of human questions in science. He certainly is a major influence on me.	2005-07-03

I read this book after Elegant Universe by Brian Greene (which I also highly recommend) because I'm fascinated by theories of the origin of the universe.<br /><br />The book is VERY readable yet SUBSTANTIVE. Simon Singh's treatment put me off at first because he begins by recounting creation myths... so I skipped ahead in the book... noticed a little statement about what some Greek dude \\"Eratosthenes\\" did... looked HIM up in the index, read THAT part, and got HOOKED... ended up reading the book cover to cover and loving it...<br /><br />What I particularly like about this review of cosmology are two things. First, Singh shows how the arguments and evidence for \\"big bang\\" (i.e., a definitive start of the universe) vs. \\"steady state\\" (i.e., it's always been and always will be) evolved over time JUST LIKE the arguments and evidence for \\"sun is the center of the solar system) vs. \\"earth is the center of the solar system\\".<br /><br />It really shows the scientific method in action AND shows that \\"it ain't over yet\\" in that all current \\"best\\" cosmology theories remain subject to further updates.<br /><br />Second, along its way the book explains how the Greek dudes figured out the size of the earth, sun and moon, and the distances apart, without any tools other than geometry and thinking, and without any experimental evidence other than measuring shadows on the ground.<br /><br />It really shows the power of inference and extrapolation from tiny data points to looking at the entire cosmos. This point is demonstrated again as Singh reviews how astronomers figure out the size and distances of stars, galaxies, other planets, black holes etc.<br /><br />Singh properly acknowledges the role of WOMEN scientists in the cosmology story... though there's room for more (acknowledgement) as we work THAT kink out of our social systems...	2005-07-03

Ever since high school I've been looking for ways to branch out my fascination and interest from physics to biology. I have read the books and collections of essays by Stephen Gould and loved them, but nothing else has so caught my attention until THIS book.<br /><br />Sean B. Carroll (there's more than one Sean Carroll out there) does a fine job showing how insect and vertebrate forms are built. More than that, he shows how they are fundamentally related WAY back in the past. Even more controversial than humans being related to chimps, we're related to, say..., lobsters!<br /><br />What's cool is these conclusions are based on repeatable experimental evidence of the makeup of DNA, genes, chromosomes etc. Carroll makes a nice analogy between the vast amount of DNA strands that are NOT expressed in individual forms and the vast amount of matter in the universe that is NOT expressed as visible stars and galaxies. (OK, so maybe I STILL like physics a little more, but I'm making progress!)<br /><br />Carroll nicely acknowledges Gould's contributions to the popularization of better public understanding of evolution (e.g., Wonderful Life) and further extends the discussion of Darwin. Trying to understand life without evolution is like trying to understand the universe without gravity. But Carroll moves the discussion from anecdotes to evidence. I like that!<br /><br />I hope to see MUCH more on this new field of evolutionary developmental biology. As much as I am interested in how the universe began (and where it's going), I am interested in how human beings began and where THEY might be going.	2005-07-03

How the Universe Began... Where it's Going	This book reawakened my interest in current theories about how the universe began and where it (may be) going. Michio Kaku writes an EXCELLENT popular summary of cosmology and string theory but is also a fully-fledged physicist in his own right, with graduate texts in print as well as other popular accounts on science and war.<br /><br />Two topics particularly interested me in this account. The first was a summary of latest evidence for what the universe is MADE of, and how it got that way. Turns out that the elements of the periodic table we all studied in school are a teensy weensy (4%) part of the universe. As human beings our bodies are also made (literally) of material from former stars!<br /><br />Second was a new interest in the findings and implications of an unlikely-sounding space experiment called the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe or WMAP for short. Singh piques your curiosity by calling this a \\"baby picture\\" of the universe.<br /><br />Reading Parallel Worlds reawakened my interest in theories of the universe to the point that I've been reading new accounts and rereading old accounts madly. I also highly recommend, for example, Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos.	2005-07-03

I've read almost ALL Modesitt's novels and series to this point. I \\"discovered\\" him in \\"Archform Beauty\\" and was intrigued.<br /><br />Alector's Choice is marked as Corean Chronicles 4 and having read it I wonder if this won't be another huge series like Recluce.<br /><br />Alector's Choice is told from what I would have called \\"the bad guys'\\" point of view, based on the first three novels, but now I'm not so sure! Now I suspect that, as in the Recluce series, MULTIPLE points of view will come out.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I like it! Like The White Order, the Ecolitan Envoy etc. it has me thinking about ethics and ecology and what are workable principles of life. That's probably why I keep reading Modesitt: there's a story with a hero AND there's material to make me think.<br /><br />I don't experience Modesitt as preaching or advocating a particular ethos, except, perhaps, to keep THINKING about ethics, ecology, workability, and life.	2005-07-01

I've been reading biographies of the famous men (and women) associated with the formation of the United States such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. \\"Iron Tears\\" is unique in that it tells about the American Revolution from the British point of view using quotes from the main players and providing fascinating historical background. I highly recommend it. Some snippets follow... many more in the book!<br /><br />King George III played a MUCH stronger role than I had ever realized... he was the hawk's hawk refusing to let go of the colonies to the bitter end.<br /><br />Benedict Arnold made a mint from his betrayal but was never received by King George nor trusted by his British peers.<br /><br />Spies for both sides were EVERYWHERE and military messages were routinely intercepted and published in the papers.<br /><br />The war dragged on for five years and the terms of peace for another two years. Washington's main accomplishment was to keep an army in existence at all times and avoid being wiped out. British citizen's patience became exhausted from increased taxes to pay for British troops overseas, and the rising fear of war with France, Spain, and Holland. Not to mention a wide-spread sympathy for the American cause!<br /><br />None of the British commanders in the Americas seemed competent or inspiring... but all were promoted or given peerages! The only hero from Britain's point of view was Major Andre, who'd suborned Arnold and was caught, tried, and hanged.	2005-06-27

I first read about this detective in \\"Bangkok 8\\" and was eager to read \\"Bangkog Tattoo\\". Even more surprising and pleasing! The detective is the head pimp in a brothel whose manager is his mother and silent partner the local police chief, his boss. The detective is a devout Buddhist. The detective is in love with the brothel's number one call girl whose profits have made her the hero of her home village. The detective sees who you were in your past lives. Confused yet?<br /><br />It all hangs together positive and upbeat and pokes thoughtful fun at \\"western\\" ways and attitudes. A Hollywood starlet forces a factory to release underage kids as workers... so the parents hire them out as sex slaves instead.<br /><br />I recommend it because it's different, it's entertaining, it's thought-provoking, and it encourages us \\"Farang\\" westerners to lighten up a little in our Puritanical ways...	2005-06-27

Well, if you're job-hunting or career-searching or mission-anguishing, this is the best resource to work with the Miller Motivated Abilities model. I've worked with Marlys in person twice, once as corporate-employed and once as self-employed. So you can tell I like the model which is a great balance to the Myers Briggs approach. How do you REALLY like to operate verus how do you THINK you're supposed to operate? Once you see that, things go \\"clunk\\" and you say OHHH! so THAT'S what happened with that job / that boss / that person / that project etc.<br />The book gives you the complete method and context, all that's missing is Marlys' personal read, but hey you'll have to email her for that. She has a web site but what I liked most about the book was I could work through the whole process sitting at Starbuck's.<br />There are several other books detailing Miller's model with him as contributing author. Marlys' treatment is the most complete, self-contained, and usable.	2003-08-07
