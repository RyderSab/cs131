US	50835794	R3AYWVM0T273AV	1583142835	149286731	Falling For You (Arabesque)	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	Really 3 and a half stars	The plot: Someone is trying to kill Montgomery Claiborne. Sabin Strong has been hired to protect him. Montgomery doesn't know this and at times suspects she might be the the one trying to kill him. <br />The compliments: I liked that Sabin was a strong woman who could take care of herself and her man.  <br />The book is very well written and the characters are well-developed. <br />The complaints: I didn't like Montgomery. He was a pompous, stubborn, self-righteous know-it-all.  <br />By page 50, I had already figured out who was trying to kill Montgomery. Mystery over. <br />The main characters don't spend much time together in the first part of the novel and when they did, they spent it arguing.  <br />The story develops too slowly; the book was over half gone before Sabin and Montgomery shared so much as a kiss.  <br />Time was wasted developing a romance between Montgomery's sister and a police officer. I wouldn't have been irritated by that it if it wasn't for the fact that the author kind of dropped that storyline and didn't pick it up again until the last chapter (which is really only an epilogue). In actuality, their romance was more interesting/entertaining than the main romance. <br />Conclusion: Not a bad book for the price, but I probably won't buy another book by this author. My main complaints would probably be that the romance between Sabin and Montgomery took too long to develop and the constant bickering (over EVERYTHING--significant and insignificant) that went on between the two of them.	2005-07-05

The action was fast paced and the story was good. I can tell this is a debut work, but I would definately read another book by this author. <br />That said, I gave the book only four stars because it pushed believability beyond the whole time travel issue. The author made Kit so strong (and some times so annoying and hypocritical) that she left nothing for Marcus to do but stand there and be pretty. Poor Marcus's character is rather flat and undetailed while Kit has so many talents as to be unbelievable. (I found Kit to be annoying when she constantly started arguments over Marcus ordering her around. The man was medieval after all. I found her to be hypocritical in the sense that she would then start ordering him around during the arguments.) <br />Small thing, but the book needed to be re-edited. There are words left out and run on sentences. The word \\"too\\" was used numerous times, but NEVER spelled correctly.	2005-06-10

And though I still loved him in this one, I wasn't interested in the plot and the love scenes left something to be desired. <br />I liked both Elena and Allegreto. I think it's the characters that save this story from being a complete loss. Even so, when I read the back jacket and the author mentions that she struggled with this one, I can believe it. The love scenes (with or without drawing blood)lack passion and romance. I found myself cold and unmoved by them. After reading the first one, I put this book down for three weeks without picking it up once. <br />I still love Allegreto and I will keep this as part of my collection, but it will be a long time (if ever) before I put forth the effort to read this one again.	2005-06-10

I agree with other reviewers who felt that the heroine, Lauren, was too immature.  She and Alistair remind me of the characters who are usually the secondary characters in a book.   <br />In attempting to have two full blown romances in one novel, the author tended to get vague in some areas.  I can only guess at how old any of the characters were.  At times, it was difficult to keep track of the passage of time.	2004-08-08

I thought it was a wonderful fairy tale like idea and I found it hard to put this book down.  Loved the main characters.  Especially Maggie.   <br />I gave it only four stars because I could have hoped for more out of the ending.  The one very late love scene was so weak that I would have rather done without it all together.  The end just felt rather rushed and fell flat. <br />Still, there was enough fun and magic here that I can't wait to get my hands on another Julie Kenner novel.	2004-08-08

This novel is a sequel to The Empress' New Clothes and can't really be read without it.  Certain parts of that novel are repeated in this one.  I liked Geris and Dak.  I wish that their romance had a greater part in this novel.  For some reason, the author chose to put in segments about other characters who I can only assume will be featured in other novels.  During these times, the main characters are not even mentioned.  <BR>Also, if you're in favor of complete monogamy from your characters as I am, this isn't the book for you.  I found the love scenes to be rather more a description of sex than love making.  I didn't find it to be nearly sensual or stimulating enough.  And here again, I don't think the main couple was focused on enough.  I can only recall one love scene that was properly described between the two of them.	2004-06-27

I gave this book three stars because it was an adventure and it was funny.  But that is where my praise ends.<BR>It lacks originality.  The author obviously read Warrior's Woman by Johanna Lindsey.  Many of the author's ideas seem inspired by it.  Even the name structures seem like they were stolen from that novel.<BR>I don't feel that in all the pages of this novel that I got to know the main characters.  I know nothing of their dreams, aspirations, or personalities.<BR>Some may equate monogamy with monotony, but I'm not one of those people.  Enough said.<BR>The characters actions lacked any kind of logic.  For example, at the end of the novel, there was danger and the warriors wanted to keep everyone within the castle walls.  Kyra and her friend Geris, who had probably been outside of the castle twice prior to this, decide that they just must have an outing.	2004-06-27

I thought the story had energy and speed.  Goldy immediately takes an active interest in the murder mystery as she knows that her friend is going to be implicated.  This story gives Goldy a chance to show how intelligent a detective she really is.  <BR>I gave it only four stars because: I do feel that there were some issues between Goldy and her husband that went unanswered at the end.  Since it is a series, I can accept that.  And I wasn't happy that one of my favorite characters died.	2004-05-27

Tobias and Lavinia are displaying some attraction for one another.  Then . . . there's the painfully predictable &quot;carriage&quot; scene.  The murder plot became so convoluted in its solution, I feared I'd be confessing next.  By the time the second short, choppy, terribly unromantic love scene rolled around, I'd literally forgotten I was reading a romance.  Tobias, likeable fellow, came off as a rather inept detective.  I'm glad I checked this out of the library instead of buying it.	2004-04-22

Fortunately, there's a geneology chart at the front and a glossary of names at the back.  Basically, it's a story of a king in need of an heir.  All his relatives want the position.  It's the story of Firekeeper, a brave young girl raised by wolves who can communicate with animals, who might be the heir he seeks.  Through Wolf's Eyes was hard to put down.

Melissa and Lincoln meet and it's practically love at first sight.  Throughout the course fo the story they don't spend much time together.  The focus of the story seems to be Melissa's 16 uncles.  I found it too many to keep track of (especially since many of them were named Ian) and I didn't even try.  Their objection to Lincoln's pursuit of Melissa is a fight that occurred 19 years ago.  This fight is brought up numerous times--enough times to bring new meaning to the phrase &quot;making mountains out of molehills.&quot;  What's more incredible is that Johanna Lindsey thought that she could base an entire novel around such a flimsy idea.  My last objectioin was to Melissa's nickname--&quot;Meli.&quot;  What was that about? &quot;Mel&quot; maybe, but &quot;Meli&quot;?	2004-03-18

It was a while before I realized that this was no usual romance. <BR>Molly O'Bannion's father dies saving the life of Don Jabal del Valle. Her father asks Jabal to protect his daughter on his death bed. Jabal takes Molly to his ranch in California. This is the first time she has ever left her mountain home. Molly is half in love with him by the time they reach his ranch. When they arrive, she finds out that he is married and has a son. His wife has abandoned him and their son to return to Spain. And that's not the only thing wrong at this ranch. The Americans want the land that has been granted to Jabal's family. Jabal has a evil grandmother with an equally evil servant.  For the first time, Molly is exposed to what life is like Native Americans. Her mother was a Cheyenne princess. All the Native Americans at Jabal's ranch are slaves.<BR>There's lots of family intrigue and I admit that I always had a hard time putting it down after picking it up. <BR>Still, I don't usually read gothic romances. I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad that it is not mine because I probably wouldn't read it twice. I liked Molly, and she seemed sensible, but she spent a good deal of the book being in love with Jabal. I find this irksome since he spent little time with her once he had her at home. When he was in her presence, he ignored her. Oh, and he was married. It was hard for me to fathom why anyone, even someone as young as she, could fall in love with him. <BR>It ends well with a mostly happy ending.  There are deaths, destruction, and madness that all lead to this active conclusion.	2003-12-05

I had no trouble putting it down. It's not a bad story, but it lacks that special spark. The main characters are likeable. They become fast friends. While the heroine soon falls in love, Duncan sees her as just a friend. She amuses him. Duncan and I don't share the same sense of humor though. While he often found her falling down funny, I found her comments playful but not really funny. The plot isn't particularly complex or fascinating.

This is the first Perry Mason mystery I've ever read. If you liked the television series, you'll find all the same characters in this book. It's a good mystery and moves swiftly.

I think they both must have fallen in love at first sight. My main wish is that Sean had kidnapped Emerald before her wedding. I know her marriage was an unhappy one that had nothing to do with love, but this book would have been just as good without the adultery aspect. The characters were likeable. Though some very sad events occur, it's a very good book.	2003-06-04

Marcus Blackmoore is one of the most unique characters I've ever read about. I absolutely fell in love with him! If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, it's worth every penny.

Jade Brennan suffered a car accident and lay in a coma. After two years, she's come home to claim her two year old daughter that she's never seen.  Jade comes home a day early only to find that her brother is not willing to give up custody. A strange man shows up at her door asking about the necklace she's wearing and then gets her involved in a revival ceremony. The ceremony revives Connor MacKenzie, the previous owner of her brother's apartment building, who died in 1886. Connor and Jade marry to help Jade gain custody of her daughter Sabrina. It isn't long before Jade is falling in love with Connor and he with her. It's a funny and touching book with loveable characters. My only complaint is that the author has Sabrina, a two year old, talking like she's four at times. Otherwise, I loved the book. This is the first book I've read by this author and I can't wait to explore more of her work.	2003-03-31

White Lily has interesting characters and does a good job of preparing the reader for sequels. Lily was a lovely, innocent character, and as the author says, she's hard not to love.

It left me questioning what happened to everyone besides Goldy.  I wish Goldy dealt with her abusive ex-husband better instead of continually having to have someone else defend her.  It's time for her to take up kick boxing, judo, karate, skillet tossing, something!  I didn't find the murderer's reason for killing plausible.

Though Martha's (the super computer)comments were funny in the previous romances, I felt that Johanna Lindsey went overboard with her this time.  Martha's character dominates in this novel, often times spouting psychobabble or redundant information.  Both Dalden and Brittany spend more time talking to her than to each other.  The two of them seemed to have no reason to love each other besides the fact that they were both tall.  I didn't appreciate the age difference.  Alien or not, he was only 21 and she was almost 30.  Brittany spent the majority of the novel not believing that she's left earth despite overwhelming evidence.  Her refusal oversteps &quot;stubborn.&quot;  It soon becomes just plain stupid.  This novel only served to make me miss Warrior's Woman--a far superior novel.	2003-01-25

Madeline is sure she's being haunted by her husband's ghost.  She seeks the assistance of Artemis.  Amanda Quick seems to working on making her mysteries less predictable.

I was very disappointed that the hero NEVER tells the heroine that he loves her.  That he slept with another woman after developing feelings for her didn't help either.

I was appalled to find that this was a sequel to Slightly Shady involving the same characters.  I read Amanda Quick for the combination of romance and mystery.  By using the same characters, she completely got rid of the romantic tension.  Lavinia and Tobias were good characters but they aren't the best ones she's ever had and they certainly aren't compelling enough to inspire two books.  She never even really described Tobias's looks in the first one.  By using the same characters, Amanda Quick is declaring herself a mystery writer instead of a romance writer.  Unfortunately, her mysteries are a bit predictable and often unrealistic.  I hate to say that since I absolutely love her earlier works.  I've stopped rushing out to buy her books.  Now I borrow them from the library.	2002-09-27

Many times I felt that the author forgot that she was writing a romance at all.  The romance is decidedly second to the mystery.  I didn't find the conclusion particualarly believeable.  This is not a bad book, but there's nothing that makes it stand out from any other Amanda Quick novel.  Those of you who know her works like I do are probably pondering the same question that I am.  What does she have against beds?  If she thinks they're mundane, then she must know that, after a dozen books, so is the now predictable love scene in the carriage.	2002-09-10

I could have hoped for a slightly different ending (but that's the romantic in me speaking).  It's rather obvious that it was adapted from a play.

I was beginning to wonder if the entire book would be dominated by one dimensional evil characters whose only motivation was greed.  Fortunately, things began to pick up.  The good characters are far more interesting than the bad ones.  There were a few surprises.  The pace (after the first 100 or so pages) is good.  It was funny as always with Mrs. Garwood.

The world around her is changing.  This is one of only two Christie novels where I was able to guess the identity of the murderer.  It's a very good murder mystery, but it could have been a better Miss Marple mystery.  The best parts of the book are when Miss Marple is on the spot.  Unfortunately, I almost began to wonder if Miss Marple would be in this novel at all.  She left her house no more than three times and was therefore decidedly shoved into the background.  The parts without her were rather dull, dry, and far too abundant.  I found myself rushing more to see if I'd solved the mystery correctly rather than out of any sense of real enjoyment.	2002-03-31

I picked up this book thinking I would be reading about detectives of the likes of Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, and Miss Marple.  The back cover lists such literary greats as Agatha Christie, William Faulkner, and Ray Bradbury.  But when I read the short story by Agatha Christie, who did it feature?  Not Poirot, not Miss Marple, but one George Rowland.  Never heard of him, you say?  Well, I have read this particular story before, but it's barely memorable.  It involves a minor mystery that does not involve a murder.  An Agatha Christie story without murder!  The editor's poor choice of this short story is indicative of the other types of stories he used to make up this collection.  Throughout the book I found one tepid and boring mystery after another.  I would definitely recommend borrowing this one before buying.	2002-01-11

While the author does give background information, she doesn't bog this book down in what happened before.  This book details Harry's second adventurous year at Hogwarts.  There is yet another mystery for Harry and his friends to unravel.  Mystery and magic rolled into one.  Sci-fi and mystery lovers should feel right at home with this book--this series.  I gave this book only 4 stars because it's not quite as good as the first one.

I feel that this novel would have been sunk if it were not for the sheer amazing number of entertaining supporting characters. The main characters don't share so much as a kiss for over a hundred pages. Often their motives aren't well explained, realistic, or even believable. Each time the two of them argued I felt like the author had a desired outcome in mind and no real plan to get there;the end of their arguments were so at variance with the start. The most dramatic moments were written in such a way that they were barely speed bumps in the sequence of events in the story. Lady Gillian and Richard are likeable characters. The story is amusing.  Not laugh out loud but amusing. This is the first book I've ever read by Victoria Alexander. I can see that she has talent and I would like to read another book by her.

Actually only two other characters even interact with &quot;Dev&quot; and &quot;Tabby&quot; more than once. I still found the book to be an enjoyable read. The main characters are likable and the beginning reminded me of being on a cruise. Even in this earlier work, there are flashes of J. A.

The first part is devoted to character development and to building the characters motives for murder.  Poirot is mentioned only incidentally in this part.  Not to worry though.  The first half of the novel is actually interesting and moves along quickly. This is partly due to the brievity of the chapters.  Part one ends with the suspected murder of the expected victim (the person everyone hates).  Poirot dominates the second half with his usual confident flair.  For the first time ever, I was able to correctly pick out the murderer in a Christie novel.  That does not mean that this novel is predictable.  It's very good and I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out for certain who the murderer was.  My only complaint is that even after he knew who the murderer was, Poirot took three chapters of explaining to reveal that person's identify to a room full of suspects.  Good novel.  I would recommend it to any lover of mysteries.	2001-08-07

Opinions differ and I understand how some readers would be offended by the bondage in this novel.  I'm not a fan of bondage, but the bondage in this novel is NOT painful.  Rowena and Warrick never do anything to intentionally cause each other physical pain.  That is the entire difference.  Rowena and Warrick have an attraction that cannot be denied which make the bondage scenes very appealing.  The love scenes leave the reader tingling.  I loved that Rowena got to &quot;...&quot; Warrick.  For a change, the man is the sex object.  <br />All that said, there are other aspects of the novel that make it worth reading.  This novel has one of the most intricate, ironic, and original plots I have ever read.  There are times of hilarity.  Touching moments.  Rowena is an admirable character.  She is strong, stubborn (at the right moments), and witty.  I'm not a big Johanna Lindsey fan.  This is one of her best.  She wrote it around the same time when she wrote other really great novels such as Man of My Dreams and Angel.	2001-05-11

If it was mentioned, I missed it.	2001-05-08

The novel starts with a clever murder.  Prior to reading this novel, I'd only liked mysteries by Agatha Christie and Poe.  I'd definitely like to read more books in this series.  I only had a few qualms about this book.  Too much of the novel passed without the certainty that there had been a murder; in effect, there was little sleuthing in the first half.  I would have preferred if the murderer had been caught differently.  This ending/capture is not very original.	2001-04-30

After seeing myself in a beach photo and thinking I looked like a beached whale, I decided I definitely needed to lose weight.  When I had to buy size 18 jeans, I told my sister to just take me out and shoot me if I got any bigger.  I'd been exercising for a half and hour EVERYDAY for a month and could see little difference in my weight.  I started the Atkins diet.  I definitely felt a little deprived on day one and two.  After a while, I adjusted.  I kept excercising.  I ate as much food as I wanted and I stuck to the diet.  I'm a meat lover so I didn't have much of a problem.  (Veggie lovers need not try this diet.)  I even had a little pizza on Fridays.  After a while, I could pull those size 18 jeans off without unfastening them.  I want to thank Dr. Atkins.	2001-04-26

She does this without being overly obvious or corny in the attempt.  Her creation is imaginative and believable because of the detail she puts into the description of the Carpathian civilization.   Dark Prince is a good read.  The suspense builds quite quickly and holds the attention of the reader.  There is a little gore.  But what's a vampire tale without gore?  The romance doesn't take a backseat to the mystery or the science fiction aspects of the story.  Raven and Mikhail are quite memorable.  They are a strong hero and heroine.  Their closeness is what all people should desire in a relationship.  I especially loved Raven and Mikhail's first conversation and their first meeting.  The ending was beautiful.  I can't wait to read more about Gregori.	2001-04-21

It does not make the romance seem like an  afterthought.  Nor does it make the supernatural elements seem silly.  The  story is well written and never boring.  I still had some questions about  the differences between Carpathians and vampires, but those are probably  answered in the first book in this series.  I already have plans to read it  and Gregori's story.	2000-09-16
US	50835794	RN6UDGIBLQB76	0553283545	918991557	Seduction	Books	1	8	23	N	N	Hated it and here's why:	I hated Sophy most of the book.  She was a liar and a nag.  She never behaved as if she loved Julian.  She had no honor.  She was always deceiving him or sneaking around.  I was totally disgusted when she drugged  him.  All male bashing was annoying.  I didn't like the ex-prostitute  Charlotte either.  Instead of blackmailing her former paramours, she would  have been better off saving her money or pawning the jewelry they gave her.   Those men owed her nothing.  That's akin to paying for a dinner  twice--once when you eat it and again a year later.	2000-07-16

I felt as though the couple did not spend enough time together.  The story is unbelievable.  I find it hard to believe that a man would make  such a vow as the one Quentin made, let alone keep it for more than two  minutes.  I like his Uncle Nick and felt that he was quite a man.  He was  very accepting.  I liked Quentin also.	2000-07-16

It simply isn't the type of book that I like.  There was immediate attraction between the characters.  That was the only good thing about the book.  After their  intial meeting, the book tends to fizzle.  There was far too much arguing  to suit my taste.  I didn't feel that the characters knew each other so  much as that they were hot for one another.	2000-07-16
US	50835794	R3OWN5YMT9WPEF	0446604151	718422603	Desperate	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not that original	The story is too much like too many stories of people travelling across the west.  There was nothing original about the characters or the plot to be of any real interest.  It's an okay story.  Borrow it from a friend or  pick it up at the library, but I definitely do not recommend that you buy  it.  It is yet another book with an open ending in hopes of snagging the  reader into purchasing an entire trilogy of books.	2000-07-16
US	50835794	R33RC9HWR03IAZ	0671744208	407222975	Castles	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Not the best	I was very disappointed by this novel.  If I'd read it alone, maybe I would have liked it.  But I read it as a continuation of the series.  I was very upset that Nathan does not make an appearance until the end of the  novel.  I was also disturbed by the physical changes Garwood made in the  other characters from previous novels.  To me, it just isn't a sequel.   Colin did not seem like himself.  Even when viewing the book separate from  the rest, the character of Alesandra is not fully fleshed out.  Nor is the  story believable.  I didn't buy their romance for a minute.  I can only  recall a few memorable moments from this novel--one touching, one funny.   This is definitely a novel to borrow but not to buy.	2000-06-11

The initial meeting of the hero and the heroine is funny and entertaining.  And there are a few more interesting chapters after the first.  I felt that at many times  Bradford could be a jerk.  Caroline cried too much and gave in too easily.   She gave new meaning to standing around waiting for a man.  The ending is  good.  I'd borrow it from someone first before purchasing it.  It is not  typical of Garwood's work.  It's one of her earlier ones before her talents  truly blossomed.	2000-06-11
US	50835794	R30SW214B70OV6	0671670069	631599251	Guardian Angel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Wow!	When I first read this book, I could not put it down.  I've read it three more times since then.  I would give it ten stars if I could.  The action is fast paced.  It's hilarious.  I loved Jade and Caine.  This book has  everything.  Good characters.  Interesting plot.  Steamy love scenes.   Never a boring moment.  And it was refreshing to see a heroine who could  rescue herself.  This book is only surpassed by it's sequel--The Gift.	2000-06-11

This one is fantastic.  It stands alone.  You could buy this one without the others and have no difficulty understanding  the plot.  This one is funnier, more edgy, and more sexy.  Highly  recommend.	2000-06-11

While I like the descriptions of the characters and the plot of the novel, I was very disappointed by the ending.  I understand that this is the first in a series, but I was so turned off by the lack of a real ending, that I  refuse to buy any more of the books in the trilogy.  Without a real ending,  this book cannot stand alone and it doesn't.  There are so many pieces  missing in this novel, presumably answered in the next so as to make it  incomplete.	2000-06-05

The beginning was good.  It had the usual Garwood flair and magic.  I don't feel that the main characters spent enough time together to  make their falling in love believable.  Some of the scenes were just silly.  And the ending was so predictable, I could see it coming from a mile away.  I was very disappointed.	2000-06-05
US	50835794	R3PBRHUM1OJ5PO	0671737821	177598856	Honor's Splendour	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Magical!	From the first chapter, I was enthralled.  This is Julie Garwood at her fairy tale best.  The book has everything.  It's touching without being overly sappy and sentimental.  It's hilarious.  The book is so good that  when the lights went out due to a storm, I finished it by candlelight.	2000-06-05
