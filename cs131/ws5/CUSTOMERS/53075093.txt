Ayer	I know this logical positivist approach to life and thinking is supposed to be out of date, generally considered false, but still, it has its attractive side, it has a common-sense feeling to it, it has a kind of clear sharp-edge quality, it is sort of seductive.  It's like something I could use in daily life.	2005-07-05

But after a while I got bored by its two themes: 1) the cuteness of the baby, the town, and the author; and 2) fodder for trivial pursuits.  There is not enough substance here for a whole book, and the prose, vague, and a little trendy, does not compensate.  A potboiler.	2004-02-05

It is more like a long first chapter and leaves one hanging at the end.  The characters are entertaining and the narrative is slightly humorous.

His writing skills can't sustain it. By the time he casually shoos away a mother bear and her cub because they were disturbing his meditation, I was hoping she would bite him.  There are much better Zen autobiographies available, such as Thank You and OK! by David Chadwick, and Ambivalent Zen by Laurence Shainberg. There must be better examples of drug nostalgia, too.

I sometimes wondered whether she was parodying the gothic genre.  The characters and dialogue are unrelievedly morbid, but with a certain amount of depth.  The plot is sort of slow.  This is the second gothic novel set in Dorset I have run across recently (the other is Ex Libris by Ross King).  I shall never visit Dorset.  I liked this novel enough to finish it, but I don't think I will read any more P. D. James.  Her detective is too introspective, sensitive, and filled with self-doubt.	2003-03-18

I know Amazon tells you the dimensions of the book, but I have to admit it's something I usually don't pay much attention to.  I had to read this entire book with a magnifying glass.  It's a shame, because it's clear the author has a lot of knowledge and I would have been delighted if she had been given more space to share it with us. Also, what a shame to shrink such gorgeous pictures (from Sotheby's) to thumbnail size!  Another caveat: the book purports to be about all non-American china, but focuses almost exclusively on England.  This was OK with me, but might be a disappointment for someone wanting more comments on Meissen, or oriental productions, for example.  Having said all this, I enjoyed every page in the book and mainly regret that there couldn't be more of it.	2002-03-25

The text is gracefully written and thoroughly informative.

The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time.	2001-12-18

Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale, The Power and the Glory.  If you are a student of fine writing, read the novel first, then read this to see how he gathered and used material.  Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico, enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself.

I shivered throughout, from the meteorological descriptions, not the plot.  This is an OK British dullsville police procedural of the Greeneland lite school, with a who-cares plot and at least 100 pages of padding.  The one who dun it stood out like a sore thumb at first introduction.  I give it three instead of two stars because it is literate and the dialogue works.  Some interesting asides on twentieth century classical music.  I find it difficult to believe that British police can get away with so much drinking on the job.  But maybe they can.  Maybe that's why it takes them those extra 100 pages to see what's in front of their nose.	2001-11-14

Never would she have used the English language the way this author makes her write. Unfortunately, her hard-to-believe &quot;letters&quot; are a very large part of the book.

It requires a little deep reading and thinking and it's not a beginner's book.  It's a real help however to ordinary people like myself who live in the suburbs and try to practice Buddhism.  Even though the author seems to have been a monk most of his life.  The reason it is a help is that it presents an American background and understanding to the teachings of Suzuki Roshi (Zen Mind Beginner's Mind) which are often sort of alien and incomprehensible in the original.  The book is also very warm like the smiles.  To get some more insight into the title, you might want to check out Gary Snyder's Cold Mountain Poems, or the Burton Watson translation of Cold Mountain (Chinese Zen Poet Han Shan).	2001-10-31

It is heavily oriented toward the British, as the Culture Shock books are a British series.  For the rest of us, it has a lot of interesting and potentially useful information that you do not find in tourist guidebooks, written in a pleasant, chatty, though sort of repetitive English nanny style.  It is fairly unorganized.  But if you're even thinking of moving to Spain, it's good to read whatever good advice you can get your hands on, and this book has plenty of it.

US	53075093	R34M51N2V8J9SR	0618062351	735494393	Kingbird Highway: The Story of a Natural Obsession That Got a Little Out of Hand	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	A Classic in the Making	I usually give books away after I read them, but this is a keeper.  I know I will want to read it again, probably more than once.  Not only is it inspirational reading for those who love birds, but it's great travel writing and a moving coming-of-age story as well.  Not only that, but the illustrations(also by Kaufman) are charmers as well.  Kaufman's trip to St. Laurence Island , between Alaska and Siberia, with its spiritual overtones, remains the high point for me. I think this book is going to develop a substantial public.  I recommend it to anyone, not just bird folks.	2001-03-21
US	53075093	R331I6LMSUEA7J	0449221180	512657531	Native Tongue	Books	3	1	4	N	N	South Florida page turner	I am a fan of Carl Hiaasen's journalism, available on the Internet, but  this is the only one of his novels I have read.  I couldn't put it down,  but I don't think I need to read any more.  I would call it Elmore Leonard  lite, the expected kinky characters, grungy milieu, off-color dialogue, and  page-turning plot. Full of cartoon violence, the story calls for big-time  suspension of disbelief.  The main problem is that Hiaasen doesn't know how  to end it.  The last hundred or so pages are repetitive and aimless.  My  suggestion: read the first half (to get the point) and the last two or  three chapters (to find out how it comes out).	2000-09-15

The text makes you want to get up and out to the woods, but the real prize is the very artistic illustrations.  I return to them again and again.  The only  drawback is the author confines himself to the southern Sierra but most or  all of these trees can be found throughout the Sierra. Also the book is not  widely distributed, but that's where Amazon comes in!	2000-07-19

It's a shame its gone out of print, but I feel sure a new edition will be in the works soon.  Gombrich is a great teacher - he stays away from techicalities and footnotes, and just gives a smooth,  easy-to-follow narrative on the course of western art.  Since he was  originally writing for an English audience, unfortunately almost all his  illustrations are from English or continental museums, which makes it hard  for Americans to go visit them.  He looks for the good in everything.  He  is strongest on renaissance and baroque artists.	2000-06-13

It did keep me wanting to know &quot;what happens next&quot; long enough to get to the  end, but I don't plan to seek out more by this author.  This book is ersatz  du Maurier more than ersatz Christie.	2000-06-12

Many nice color illustrations of a wonderful collection. There are also a lot of black and white illustrations that are a little hard to make out. This is not a history of famille rose as such although there is a lot of historical information embedded in it. It is also not a collecting guide or price guide.	2000-05-19

Oh yes, if you are a Thomas Hardy fan you might find the work of this Nordic disciple  fascinating. (The author never lets you forget he's read Dostoevsky and all  the sagas as well.)Otherwise, you may find it, as I did, a prolix chronicle  of unremitting tragedy.  The author's ironic attitude to his protagonist is  not sufficient to answer the question why anyone bothers with this wretched  account of a man who destroys everyone who comes under his meager  authority, mainly for the sake of his ego.  The book is gloriously written  and/or translated. I don't know Icelandic, so I don't know how much the  translator contributed. The characters are vibrant and memorable.  The  landscape  is exotic.  I can see why Laxness won the Nobel Prize. So the  surface is good, but underneath, it's an Ingmar Bergman version of Little  House on the Glacier.<br />This book would benefit greatly from a few  footnotes.  Laxness evidently thought he would only be read by Icelanders,  so there are a lot of customs, implements, and other details that need some  explaining. Also, skip the frivolous intro by Brad Leithauser.  After all,  the book does have some of the greatness of tragedy to it, which Leithauser  seems to miss entirely.  Not only that, he gives away a lot of the plot,  and utterly misinterprets the most fascinating feature of the book, the  interplay between folklore and day-to-day life, an exploration of how the  harsh life of the Icelandic peasantry reenacts in a down-to-earth way the  most horrific imaginings of mythology.	1999-01-20

Cavarnos's simple narrative style and his forthright reporting of his conversations bring it to life.  This is a book I keep reading over  and over.  It combines spiritual depth with what for me is beautiful escape  reading. This book avoids the polemics of Cavarnos's other book on Athos,  &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;.  Not a literary masterpiece, but highly  recommended.	1999-01-20

Gives folks some more to chew on after they may have assimilated the contents of his previous books.  Goldstein's serious but charming personality always shows through transparently in his writing.	1998-06-30

Lucky for me, 30 years later Willa Cather's essays sent me back to it and I was entranced by the lyricism, wisdom, insight and grace of the vignettes of late nineteenth century life on the coast of Maine.  Jewett is a kind heart but not a romanticizer, and her characters are true and deep.  I'm eager to read more of her work.	1998-06-09

One senses this is an important book and some of it is fascinating but a little goes a long way, especially if you are not deeply involved in agriculture.  Like many ecological jeremiads, it is long on diagnosis and short on cure.  The saving graces are Berry's graceful prose and sometimes luminous wisdom, occasional lyricism.	1998-06-09

The most intriguing are two (Pambo and Onnuphrius) that must be classed as imaginative literature of the spiritual journey.  George of Choziba is the most down-to-earth and realistic, despite all the miracles.  One minor cavil: Vivian's over-literal translation style sometimes falls into a kind of &quot;translatese&quot; with odd results.  But never mind, this book is a major boon to those of us who haven't had access to many writings of this kind in English.	1998-01-12
