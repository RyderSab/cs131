I can't believe how much you get for the price of this book.  The illustrations are amazing, and the explanations of the human body, its functions, and disorders related to each system are clear and understandable.  While anatomy parts are given their correct medical terms, the explanations use everyday language and are therefore very easy to understand.  I have found this to be an excellent supplement to my medical terminolgy book, as an added resource to get a grasp on what REALLY goes on in our bodies.  This book is one not to be missed!	2004-03-15

This book is a good introduction to medical terminology.  It is not as comprehensive as some that are on the market, though.  My edition did not come with a CD, but shows it as an optional tool.

I love the layout of this book.  It makes it easy to memorize new terms and to locate information.  There are very useful vocabulary lists at the beginning of each chapter.  The learning exercises at the end of each chapter easily help you pinpoint areas that need further study.  However, the CD has errors.  In the first 2 chapters, I have already found 3.  For example, I typed in \\"histologist\\" as an answer to one of the questions and it said I was incorrect and that the correct answer was histologist!  Then it incorrectly matched the pairs \\"poster/o\\" and \\"in front of, before\\", which is also incorrect.  If you study the material throroughly you will be able to recognize these errors.  At first I was also disappointed to find there is no answer key to each of the tests at the end of the chapters, but as is turns out, it just causes me to look for the answers to check myself, which just serves to reinforce the learning process, so I see it as a positive now!  I'm still glad I got this book and would recommend it for others.	2004-01-29

This is a great book for brushing up on the basics of grammar, but I have found some mistakes in the answer keys to the &quot;Chapter Checkouts&quot;.  For example, in Chapter 4, it goes over comparative and superlative adverbs.  In the answer key it says the comparative and superlative for &quot;easily&quot; are &quot;easier and easiest&quot;, but this is not true; it would be &quot;more easily and most easily&quot;.  &quot;Easier&quot; and &quot;easiest&quot; would be the comparative and superlative for &quot;easy&quot;, not &quot;easily&quot;.  I have found myself checking this book against the Gregg Reference Manual more than once since it is THE standard on this subject.

I love the concept of the book more than I love the content.  I found it to be a bit cliche-ish, which got tiresome.  Plus I would have liked to see the verse references in the same place as the verses, rather than listed at the back of the book.  I soon grew tired of flipping back and forth and quit looking for the reference.  But the reason I was looking for the reference in the first place was because of Rick Warren's use of liberal paraphrases which made Scriptures unrecognizable to me.  I enjoyed reading them, but I don't feel this book was the place to use them.  I think the content of the book would have been better substantiated with the use of an actual translation, not various paraphrases, and limited verses from translations.  <br />I also found that the journal gave more pages than necessary for each chapter, and I found myself wondering what I was supposed to write on all those pages.<br />There were a few statements that didn't agree with, but I don't expect to agree with EVERYthing in a book.  This is a good book, a worthy effort on the part of Rick Warren, and a worthwhile read, but truthfully The Pursuit of Holiness had more impact on me than this book did.  It challenged me to live \\"a life of purpose\\" more than the book of that title did.<br />Still and all, I'm glad I purchased and read the book, and would probably still recommend it to others, especially new believers.	2003-11-09

This book has very valuable information, and while I agree that one should stay in touch with their feelings, I dislike the wording used to describe it......&quot;going inside yourself&quot;, &quot;inner journey&quot;, &quot;inner balance&quot;, too much New Age mumbo jumbo to just say to stay in touch with your feelings.  I personally draw my strenth, guidance and wisdom from God through an abiding relationship with Jesus Christ, not by going &quot;inside myself&quot;....I do like the analogy of &quot;popping the hood&quot; to check in with those feelings, and the actual concept of &quot;the method&quot;, but don't like the New Age flavor it's written in. I have still taken away useful information by distilling it down to its basic concepts and disregarding the phraseology used to describe it.  I wish there were a Christian book written about these concepts.  It would be great!	2003-10-22

One reviewer mentioned than Radclyff's first love was Amber's mother - how did I miss that???????  And is that true?  And why did the author end the book the way she did.....at the mention of Lady Carlton's death, my first thought, was, \\"well, we just kill 'em off at a moment's notice when convenient, don't we?\\" and I didn't find her sudden death even plausible - now I know why....but I was waiting the whole book for Lord Carlton to find out Amber's backgroud was of nobility, not yoemen farmers, but that never materialized.  And I truly thought Amber would \\"come around\\" and in the end, realize she was truly meant to be with the Earl of Almsbury - that didn't happen either.....I read this book every moment I got, and then, in the end, thought, \\"hmmmmmm, all that, for that!\\"......I was left just a bit disappointed.

I actually had a hard time putting this book down, and it was a really well written book.....very reminiscent of Gone With the Wind - some scenes especially - I loved the book and am glad I read it, but there was a nagging thought in my head that, yes, in retrospect, it WAS God's will for the North to win, and for slavery to be abolished since that IS what happened.  But it bothered me that is seemed God approved of Caroline's obvious betrayal of her government and her family when God's word says to obey governing authorities, and I wondered if this could send a wrong message about being faithful.  As a Southerner I was a little bothered by her betrayal of the South, too.  But the story is well-told, and probably parallels the truth of someone's life back then, even though this is a fictional account, and it did give me a different perspective of the civil war and the realities of the day.  I could not put this book down once I started it.	2003-07-06

First of all, I'm not willing to gain 3-5 pounds in order to \\"speed up\\" my metabolism, considering I only have 10 to lose in the first place; nor am I willing to allow myself periodic monthly gains of 3-5 pounds, hoping to lose \\"a few pounds in 2 days of dieting per month\\" in an effort to maintain my weight.  Thirdly, I would never be able to even reach 2500-3000 calories per day on a healthful diet.  I also don't agree with his macronutrient percentage recommendations:  for the 1200 calorie plan, he recommends 40% protein, 20% carbs, and 40% fat.  My body functions much better on higher (healthy carbs), lower (high quality) protein, and lower fat levels.  Possibly this is more geared to people who have more substantial amounts of weight to lose. I may be willing to implement Phase 1 of the diet for one week, just to see what results I get.  All that having been said, I love Mr. Heavin's style of writing and there is some wonderful information in this book regarding the workout itself and just reading this book will inspire you to get moving and to include strength training in your workouts.  I'm still glad I got this book and it will continue to be a valuable resource for me.  I'm just not sure I will follow his diet plan as laid out, choosing to keep my weight at more steady levels rather than continually gaining and losing the same 3-5 pounds every month for \\"maintenance\\" as he suggests.  If I could lose 3-5 lbs. by dieting 2 days a month, I wouldn't have 10 to lose in the first place!  I'm not discounting his method as wrong, just not sure it is right for me.	2003-04-26

There are generalized concepts presented here, but none go into detail about how to implement them.  There are stories of clients that sound fabricated.

Enough already.  I love the Daoust's diet and their first book, and the second is okay...but, really!!!!

At first I could only focus on the lengthy run-on sentences (not the details...I like detail and it served a purpose here), the lack of proper grammer and punctuation as well as the constant use of the words quiver and quaver (author must like those words!)....but then once I set those things aside and just read, I couldn't put the book down.  I wanted the question, &quot;Why?&quot; answered.  It is never addressed.  As one who is the same &quot;age&quot; as Marianne and having gone to high school in the seventies, a part of me understands.  It is not how families deal with members today who have been victimized, or who have made mistakes, but the seventies was a different time.  At times this book was too painfully real for me and I had a hard time reading it.  I held back the tears until Muffin got sick and then I let go and I still can't stop crying.  Even the end of the book, where we are supposed to sense a &quot;healing&quot; for the family, felt sad and tragic and yet again too real...and I just cried and cried.  I literally felt pain for this family...part of me wishing I had never picked up this book and part of me understanding it in a way that I could not put it down.  The truth is, life moves forward, and everyone deals with the events of their life in their own way, sometimes to the detriment of others.  So I am glad I read this book and even though I am finished, it will stay inside me for a long time.  I don't know if I liked the author's writing style, but I did get used to it.  But she does have keen insight into people as they are.  I would recommend it, but not if you're looking for a &quot;light&quot; read.

I have read Suzanne Somer's book and in theory like what I hear, but following it, one has to eliminate basic traditional (healthy) items like a tuna sandwich.  Hard to put into practice.  I also don't understand Diana Schwarzbein's support of the book because even though she agrees with raised insulin being the cause of overweight, her program is more similar to the Zone....carbs, protein and fats at every meal...a totally different approach....so why does she endorse Suzanne Somer's book?

It was well worth it, although I was disappointed in the outcome.  I do wish, however, that other reviewers would actually review the book rather than disclose the contents of the book.  I would have been disappointed to be given so much information had I read the reviews before purchasing the book.	2001-06-17

If you don't like to cook from scratch, you'll love this cookbook.  Everything comes from a box, bottle, can or package...as easy as using a can opener.  Friendly, down to earth format makes this a pleasant, even if not super healthy, cookbook.	2001-05-28

I had seen the movie (and they really did a good job of basing it on the book), but the book is better.  Only through the written word can we get &quot;inside&quot; the characters.  This book illustrates the importance of community in a way that's believable.  A book worth reading!<br />Also recommended:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and Through a Glass Darkly	2001-05-20

I could not put the book down...and to think I put off buying it for several months because I didn't want to pay the cover price.  It is worth every penny.  It taught me so much about the human spirit, endurance, community and priorities.  I look at things I thought necessities (coffee creamer, fresh produce) as appreciated little luxuries now.  To top it off, even though the author is an M.D., her writing style proves she is a very gifted writer.  God has blessed her beyond belief.  After her experience, I am sure she realizes that (even though Christian views were not really ever expressed in this book....sadly).  Those who criticize her book should ask themselves, &quot;Would I dare live through her experience?&quot;  And those looking for a book &quot;on breast cancer&quot; missed the point of the book entirely.  I was not disappointed one bit by this book.  It is a must read!!!!	2001-05-19

But in this new book she resorts to bashing all other diets out there, with a definite edge to her &quot;voice&quot;, only to sum up the recommended way of eating to be yet another &quot;diet&quot; which she calls &quot;The Smart Weigh&quot;.  She never called her plan that in the other books, yet she acts as if it was called that all along.  It is frustrating when an author keeps repackaging the same material to make more money.  It's even sadder when a Christian author puts down others in the repackaging in order to do it. I was disappointed by this book.	2001-05-15

It also talks too much about herbal therapy/supplementation and colon cleansing as well as centering it's content on new age philosphy.  As a Christian I found this hard to wade through and found myself skipping all those parts.  Yes, vegetables and fruits are nutrient dense, but I don't believe they have a &quot;life energy force&quot; which &quot;gives me life.&quot;  My &quot;life source&quot; is Jesus Christ....my nutrition comes from the food I eat.  Frankie Avalon should have stuck to the nutritional aspects of a vegetarian lifestyle and steered clear of all the new age mumbo jumbo....that's what gives vegetarianism its bad name.	2001-05-14

The tips are good, but some conflict with each other....garlic in oil...is it good for one week or several weeks....refrigerate or not?  Some of the directions are also a little sketchy.  But with a little trial and error and a few ingredient substitutions, this will be a cookbook I will use periodically.  Also recommended, &quot;The Cheapskate Gourmet&quot;.	2001-04-05

Like she was weaving a tapestry and it started  unraveling before she was done.  Her writing style captivated me and that  is what kept me interested in reading the book until the very last page.   Definitely worth reading.	2000-05-29

This is nothing but NEW AGE in a pretty cover.  It's all about self, self, self...quite the opposite of what the bible teaches.  Don't waste your money.  Amazon has many great Christian books available  without our having to compromise our beliefs to read them.	1998-12-12

I believe wholeheartedly that she has hit on the missing key as to why people gain their weight back after dieting.  They have not had their hearts changed.  But I do have a concern that she never mentions the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit to help us turn out hearts toward God.  Without Him we would not be able to do it.  But the book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she is a little heavy handed when it comes to additictions or victims of abuse.  Plus I myself am allergic to Nutrasweet and she says that's impossible.  But I know my own body...it doesn't like Nutrasweet, and it loves water and exercise.  But I would still give this book a 10 and will read it many times I am sure.	1998-03-23
