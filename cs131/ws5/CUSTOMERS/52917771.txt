As I read other reviews I can understand how some might be disappointed, but I really enjoyed this book.  Sure, I grabbed it because I loved Secret Life of Bees but this stands on its own merits too. Perhaps I can understand Jessie's personal struggle because I know so many women the same age who are also grappling with a similar midlife crisis but in this case Jessie makes the right choice and I appreciated that.  I loved how she found herself and realized her life or marriage couldn't be the same and remade it.  I loved the friendship of the three older women and the analogy that they were the Three Fates.  I loved the writing style and the descriptive text.  Yes, some of the characters could have been fleshed out more but it didn't detract from the book.  I finished it in two days, totally drawn into the story and I think others will like it too.	2005-04-14

Unlike most of the nonfiction work I have read, Queen Elizabeth is made out in this story to be an indecisive romantic simpleton who had to be lead to every important decision she made by the men surrounding her.  Instead of masterfully playing the field to keep alliances as most historians feel she did, she is portrayed as whining and indecisive about her lovelife as well, controlled totally by Robert Dudley and William Cecil.  I found this book almost insulting in it's lack of strong feminine characters - and here is one of the strongest, most heroic female characters of her age.  If you are looking for a hot romance book - this is it.  If you want a good piece of historical fiction about Queen Elizabeth I then read Alison Weir.	2005-01-26

Mr. Lott writes beautifully but goes way overboard in some of his descriptive passages and constant rehashing of Naomi's &quot;sin&quot;.  Get over it already!  Instead of finding Naomi a sympathetic character, which I believe was his intention, I became exasperated with her whining, self flagellation and deep, emotional thoughts.  There's a lot of promise here but I was glad when it was over.	2004-07-18

I think I've read nearly everything Berg has written but was so disappointed in this book.  Perhaps because I had just read a true-crime book about real child abuse, this story seemed hollow and sloppily put together and never rang true.  The characters were undeveloped and too shallow.  Was this written quick to satisfy some contract with the publisher?  Sure seems like it.	2004-07-18

Even though this is a &quot;typical&quot; Jodi Picoult book in formula - court scenes and surprise ending, I just love the stories this woman weaves and the insights she has.  The subject is close to my own heart, having a child with a fatal disease, and I was brought to tears many times throughout the story (have the tissues ready for the end of the book).  I would recommend it, especially if you enjoyed Picoult's other books.	2004-04-03
US	52917771	R3P2QVWNOCFI21	0060513713	908160261	The Goblin Wood	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	excellent!	This is easily one of t he best books I've ever read. Hilari Bell creates an entire world of magic, superstition and war. It takes place in the Realm of the Bright Gods, and the main characters are Makenna, a hedgewitch, and Tobin a knight. Makenna hates all humans becuase of how they betrayed and killed her mother. Tobin has taken the blame for the rebellion his brother has ben involved , and now is an outcast. In an attempt to win back his honor, and save the entire realm, he sets off to kill the legendary sorceress of Goblin Wood, who has an entire army of \\"enslaved\\" goblins to do her will. Makenna, who is only a mere hedgewitch, and is only fighting to save goblinkind from the superstitious humans, is ready to drive off Tobin like all the other bounty hunters that have entered the forest. But Tobin, who has nothing to lose, is not so easily driven off, and manages to  take her captive. Makenna and Tobin have more in common with each other than they realize, and Tobin soon begins to love the goblins he once hated. Now Tobin is torn between saving the goblins, and staying loyal to his origional task, and the wellfare of the realm. <BR>     This book is nearly impossible to put down once you've started it, and the plot is full of sybolism of today's problems as well. Anyone who loves this book will also love \\"The Seer and the Sword\\" and \\"The Healer's Keep\\" both by Victoria Hanley.	2003-12-28

This story didn't disappoint with it's vivid descriptions of life in a harem, the brutality of the times and the interesting \\"who dunnit\\" that was, for me, a surprise until the end.  There's a lot of sex in this book, almost too much, so if this offends you be aware.	2003-12-14

Unfortunately, this book does not come close.  There is a recurrent theme of raunchy sexual thoughts that permiate the book and add nothing to the story.  A suggestion or a thought from one of the characters perhaps but we are continually bombarded by the lustful ... thoughts of the priest and the raunchy  thoughts of another main character.  Too much and unnecessary as were the continuous references to Anne's period and allergy problems.<BR>I was also disappointed in the ending, felt it could have been so much better.  Instead of uplifting it was depressing and unsatisfying.  Hopefully Mr. Guterson has another good book in him - this isn't it.	2003-10-23

Delight quickly turned to disappointment.  Guterson's main characters are all obsessed with sex - Ann masterbates, she's been sexually abused in her past; Tom Cook thinks constantly about raunchy sex and imagines himself doing it with every woman he runs across; the priest masterbates and thinks about sex and the woman that &quot;befriends&quot; Ann (really uses her) is worried about men being attracted to her.  I felt like Guterson was having some sort of mid life crisis, couldn't stop thinking about sex and had to write a book about it. It totally overwhelmed what could have been a very interesting and imaginative story.   The ending was a disappointment as well - not what I had hoped or expected.  I hope Mr. Guterson's got another good book in him somewhere - this sure isn't it.	2003-10-11

Beautifully written, this book takes you through the gut wrenching emotional rollercoaster a woman experiences when her husband unexpectedly leaves her for a much younger woman - a younger woman not only her friend and business associate but who also steals her job (this happens at the beginning, I am not spoiling the story).  Yet, this is not a bitter diatribe, just a lovely, unfolding story of a woman who realizes eventually she will be all right and perhaps even better because of it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend the book.	2003-02-27

The characters were...almost comical, and I don't believe Mr. Fergus knows a woman's mind as well as he might think.  In fact some of his descriptions of sexual scenes almost seem like they come from his own fantasies - certainly not something a woman would have necessarily enjoyed or noted in a journal.  And yet.......  descriptions of the countryside and the Cheyenne way of life were so interesting and sympathetic. Worth a look if you enjoy this kind of story.	2002-10-10

While it is a factual and well researched history book, it reads like a novel, with a great amount of detail.  Her descriptions of Elizabethan life and court life make you feel as though you are really there. <br />The author states very clearly in her introduction that this is not meant to be a study of the politics of the time, or a social history but  &quot;a history of Elizabeth's personal life within the framework of her reign, drawing on her own extensive literary remains, as well as those of her contemporaries.&quot;  Therefore, those reviewers who are unhappy about what was left out of the story apparently misunderstood the author's intent. <br />If you want an excellent, interesting book on the life of Elizabeth I, this is it!	2002-01-02

Thick pages similar to the recently released Anthology, great graphics and font.  The photographs of the Beatles, who are relaxed and acting like themselves are intriguing.  I was disappointed, however, that I sat down and read this book in its entirety in a little over an hour.  While Mr. Saltzman's casual chats with the Beatles are interesting there's no great revelations here that many fans won't already know.  The photos are good but are pretty repetitious, most of them having been taken in about three different sessions. This book makes a great &quot;coffee table&quot; book and a good conversation starter but don't buy it expecting to learn anything new - it's just not there.	2001-03-03

We loved the Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife and waited with impatient anticipation for the Amber Spyglass.  Never for a minute were we disappointed with the result.  My girls would cry in frustration when I stopped reading at the end of a chapter and send them to bed, then I would &quot;cheat&quot; by reading ahead after they went to bed.  We NEVER wanted it to end, but couldn't wait to find out what happened.  <br />While I understand that some Christians are offended by this series it opened many avenues for discussion in our house about God, Christianity and religion as a whole (and we are Episcopalians by the way).  We compared it to Narnia and talked about much of the symbolism. It was a wonderful journey that we hated to end!	2001-03-03

No airline would treat the family the way this one was treated, no pilot would risk the lives of his passengers or his crew by  carrying a bomb or anything close to it!  I also found it very hard to  believe that he could have two families and Kathryn wouldn't have found out  - the whole story was totally bogus.  I did, however, find it was a  page-turner for at least the first half, a very easy read.  Is Oprah really  reading these books or not?	1999-09-13

Historical fiction is a favorite of mine, especially about the American West but I found this book very boring and depressing. Lydie never  succeeds at a single thing - she loses her home, her husband, her horse,  her baby.  She fails at her attempt to resettle in K.T., she fails to  rescue a slave, she alienates her friends, family and those that try to  help her.  You end the book thinking her life was a waste. I was also  disappointed at the factual detail ad nauseum of the conflict between the  abolitionists and the Missourians.  The story became completely mired down  in this conflict without proving a thing.  If I hadn't been so determined  to finish it (hoping for it to get better) I would have quit before part  two. Ms. Smiley does write beautifully, hence the three stars but I  honestly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they needed help  getting to sleep.	1999-07-01
