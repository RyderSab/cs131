Unfortunately I found myself disgusted at this groupie because it's one thing to sleep around and no one else's life is being affected but her son should not have had to live the life he did because of her and \\"G's\\" neglectful parenting.  Yes, \\"G\\" is just as responsible for their son having an uncalled for messed up life as she is and I have no respect for this man either.   <br /> <br />It turns out that this book was written by a trick whistle blower trying to capitalize off of the names of entertainers she has slept with.  <br /> <br />Even towards the end when claiming to be \\"under construction\\" she still falls back to her old ways of using her body for money.  And as I read the end I got the feeling that she has not changed her ways but has instead fooled herself into believing she's in charge of these nasty situations.  Starting a clothing line called \\"Superhead\\" and then saying that the term is used positively in the U.K.?  Trick please, you are in the U.S.A., and you will not see anyone with an ounce of sense proudly sporting clothes that have Superhead splashed across them. <br /> <br />By the end, I failed to feel sorry for Ms. Steffans, just disgusted with her being in love with EVERY SINGLE MAN she came in contact with.  I don't understand what this book was trying to accomplish and don't think you will either if you waste your money.  I just feel sorry for her son as he's trying to grow up and be normal.  Does she actually think he will get older and thank her for putting her sexual exploits with entertainers in a book?  His road is going to be the toughest and I hope she realizes that this flashy lifestyle is worth nothing if she won't have her son's respect.	2005-07-30

Score one for Paula Froelich.   The inside flap says \\"...Paula Froelich has a true insider's knowledge of what it takes to attain stardom in any field.\\"  Not true.  Miss Paula is more concerned on giving you tips on how to make it in the entertainment industry while giving a list of what a public relation's employee should not do to get on her bad side. <br /> <br />Buy this book only if you want entertainment tips and a little bit of celebrity gossip mixed in.  Don't buy it if you want serious career tips.	2005-06-27

Spring Break is here and two girls from New Jersey named Alexa and Holly decide to go to South Beach, Miami to live it up.  Sounds like fun and not out of the ordinary for best friends to do?  Well Alexa and Holly go to South Beach under slightly different circumstances.  They used to be best friends before they got to high school and each one is using the other as an escape from New Jersey for Spring Break.  Alexa needs to get away because she just broke up with her boyfriend Tyler and her friends don't have any room for her to go with them to Cozumel.  Holly's strict parents won't let her go to California with her friends so she's stuck in New Jersey.  Alexa convinces Holly to travel to South Beach with her while Holly comes up with the plan that they'll use the convenient excuse of visiting her Grandma Ida.  Holly doesn't mention to Alexa that she's hoping to meet up with her first kiss crush, Diego. <br /> <br />The plan sounds great but just unravels from there.  The girls get to Miami and Grandma Ida has no intention of the girls messing up her over-50 groove thing, so she gets a hook for them at the motel Flamingo and agrees to keep it on the down low from Holly's parents.  The girls meet a party crew their age at the motel and proceed to spend their week clubbin', finding old and new loves, making friends, and finally realizing what they missed in each other as best friends. <br /> <br />This is a pretty good book although all of these teenagers drink alcohol like fish and hookups are the norm for them.  This is girls gone wild for the teenage set.  Really this story doesn't have anything you wouldn't get from watching The O.C. or Laguna Beach.  Ms. Friedman does have good writing skills and manages to have good character development with both Alexa and Holly.  I really liked the ending in that it wasn't fairy tale but realistic and at the same time satisfying to me as a reader.  I think Ms. Friedman has a good book her and would read other novels from her in the future.	2005-06-27

It's a look into the life of being a personal assistant and although it is fiction, the author knows firsthand since she was herself a personal assistant for some twenty odd years. <br /> <br />Corki Brown is a great assistant to many of Hollywood's stars but like Hollywood these stars are fickle and unloyal.  Corki does everything except wipe these client's butts at the expense of her 10 year old son Blaise who is constantly crying out for attention in his behavior.  Blaise is one of my favorite characters, a little boy that is wise beyond his years but still a little boy which is what Corki sometimes forgets in her never-ending need to please.  She works for clients that don't understand the word no, it's foreign to them.  What does she get in return for over twenty years of service?  Well, no work from clients at a moment's notice, no health benefits, and very little sleep.  She's also aging in a town of women that don't want to look over 25.  Her main client Lucy lets her boyfriend practically replace her with two girls whose only previous assistant experience is being part of a foursome.  I respect the fact that Corki stayed true to her beliefs until the end in not giving her client's lives to the tabloids although that would have been the easy route. <br /> <br />Heather Howard's descriptions are dead on of L.A. and the attitudes that go with it.  I suspect Ms. Howard may be fielding movie offers right at this moment.  If this does go to the big screen hopefully she'll stay true to all the characters and make sure they're cast exactly like their descriptions in the book. <br /> <br />This book jumps around a lot, you actually feel like you're zooming around town with Corki but I think this was intentional.  Ms. Howard really wants you to feel what it's like in the life a personal assistant.  These employees feel gratification in pleasing their employers at no cost no matterhow degrading the request.  I suggest that those thinking of going to L.A. or New York to be an assistant because they think it's glamorous to read this book.  You'll find out really fast that all that glitters isn't gold.  Good job Ms. Howard!!	2005-06-23

Nikki Turner has come HARD with \\"The Glamorous Life\\"!!!  I am glad that Ms. Turner woke up and smelled the dollars by going to another publishing company.  Triple Crown was bringing you down.  Congrats on a new deal and an editor that made your book shine like it should without all those messy typos and grammatical errors. <br /> <br />I will say it a second time.  Buy this book!!!  It reads like a player's manual from beginning to end.  Sheila E. will be proud that her song is the soundtrack for this book.  The main character Bambi was schooled from the best, her mother.  There were two main points I liked about Bambi - one, she wasn't a light-skinned chick with green eyes and straight hair.  She was described as a beautiful black woman and all shades of black women should be appreciated from light to dark in our fiction.  Two, Bambi wasn't from the projects which shows that not all gold-diggers reside in the hood.  They come in all colors and backgrounds.  Bambi makes mistakes and the dirt she throws out also comes back to her.     <br /> <br />Ms. Turner put so much game in this book that it should have come with Cliff's Notes.  It was an exciting page-turner from beginning to end, puts you right in the middle of VA while reading.  My hats off to Ms. Turner because I loved \\"A Hustler's Wife\\" but thought the next books were just okay.  I'm glad I didn't write you off and when Miss Yarni was mentioned you had me.  I will definitely be buying your next book which I hope will be a sequel with two of VA's top fictional ballas- Bambi and Yarni!	2005-06-03

I think that Chyna Black was a very good read.  Even though I liked Ms. Ervin's debut novel, you can tell that she has improved with this book.  We may as well give her the crown on these urban relationship stories.   <br /> <br />Chyna Black's characters are well developed with dialogue and action that is entertaining to read.  I like the fact that Ms. Ervin's books point out that in many cases the reason a lot of women end up in drama filled relationships is because of absentee fathers.  Many young women don't have the example of how a relationship is supposed to work.  The main character Chyna was on the right track at one point.  She got into some things but nothing too bad.  She went to school and kept her grades up.  But Chyna's father was not in the picture and when she starts to have major problems with her mother she feels she has no choice but to move in with her boyfriend Tyreik.  Tyreik draws her in with money, a false sense of independence, and so called love.  Chyna loses her sense of self, drops out of school, and thinks that shopping is what life is about.  Little does she know that because something looks good to you it may not be good for you.  The drama begins and you will not want to put this book down.  <br /> <br />I could have done without the last few chapters.  I liked how Chyna's situation turned out for the best after all that happens to her, I just could have done without Ms. Ervin's semi-autobiographical references and shout outs of books by other TCP authors.  Just a bit much.  Despite that this book is a hit.  I recommend you read it and have your friends read it too.  I'm ready for the next one!!	2005-05-12
US	34766942	R3NPXKGAQ1UAUY	0974789526	775301499	Me & My Boyfriend (Triple Crown Publications Presents)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good Debut Novel	Like so many of the other reviewers, I found \\"Me And My Boyfriend\\" to be a good read.  I enjoyed this book so much because although it's marketed as a \\"street novel\\" it's really just a good old fashioned love story.  Many women can relate to the falling in love, losing yourself, getting your heart broken aspects of relationships which makes this story so appealing.  Ms. Ervin made you sympathize with the characters while her vivid descriptions of the St. Louis area is sure to make those residents proud.  Another exceptional part of this book is the meeting between Black and his father.  I thought this was one of the most touching and realistic moments I've read in any fiction.  The language you used in that conversation was on point and really had me rooting for Black from that moment on.     <br /> <br />Unfortunately I can only give 4 stars and not 5 because of a few missteps.  One being Daryl.  I thought his character was very realistic up until the faceoff with Black.  Please tell me how he came out of that?  This scene could have been handled much differently if he was going to be a key part of the ending.  Also, Meesa's relationship with Mike, it seemed like they had two first meetings.  When Mike's true identity was revealed, his actions and Meesa's reaction didn't make sense.  I know this is fiction but the Daryl and Mike characters could have been tighter.  Also, on numerous occasions Ms. Ervin places parentheses around the characters' thoughts.  Doing this shows that you underestimate your reader as well as your own writing ability.  In a storyline that flows you'll never need to resort to such an amateurish trick and I'm quite surprised your editor allowed you to do this.  Just trust your writing and trust your reader to pick up on your character's thoughts. Judging from the positive feedback, your fans got what you were trying to say, and I'm guessing they didn't need those parentheses to get what your were saying.    <br /> <br />I really did enjoy thisbook and have to say that I started reading thinking it was going to be horrible since TCP is notorious for typos and grammatical errors in their books.  This book had minimal errors and was actually a quick read.  Good luck in the future Ms. Ervin, I look forward to reading the improvement in your writing with your second novel \\"Chyna Black\\".	2005-05-10

Ms. Baker took the challenge and improved her writing which can only get better as time goes on.  She made sure to have more action with each of the characters and the story was a serious page turner.  I look forward to her next novel.  <br /> <br />Although I liked this novel, I can only give it 3.5 stars.  Why?  Ms. Baker may have stepped up her writing game but the editors at Triple Crown aren't even at the starting line.  I don't know how the authors submit their finished work at this publication but I do know that it is a crying shame that on almost every other page of this book there were grammatical errors and typos.  I will continue to say that Triple Crown needs to be more professional in what's being printed.  You will continue to be perceived as a \\"ghetto book company\\" if you don't correct these mistakes.  It takes so much away from the story.  I think that you are also taking your customer for granted.  Fifteen dollars is a lot to spend for one book, it's not too much to ask that the mistakes are at least kept to a minimum.   <br /> <br />Also, when the reviewers are reviewing the book, it's not necessary to give away all the details, just say if you like it or not!!  There are too many reviews on here where people are telling everything that happens, including the end.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

This book has a very nice foreward that will capture in words what the artist is trying to say in her photographs. <br /> <br />I have made a few visits to Harlem and saw some of what Ms. Attie portrayed in her photographs - national chain stores like Old Navy and H&M, cops harassing street vendors just trying to make it, and the worst of all, a large majority of the older stores that have been in the community for decades boarded up.  It's very sad.  I just wish there would have been more photographs, I didn't want it to end.  I also noticed that on or near page 65 is a portrait of 3 children, one little girl has on a pink shirt.  This portrait was also used on the cover of the book, \\"American dream : three women, ten kids, and a nation's drive to end welfare\\" by Jason DeParle.  Just thought I'd point that out.  Good job Ms. Attie!!	2005-04-28

When I picked up \\"Rap Superstar\\" I just knew it was going to be a waste of time.  I assumed it would just highlight a rapper and the trouble he gets into. This turned out to be a love story, the main character just happens to be a rapper.  The writing is quick, minimal grammatical and typing errors, and the ending may be typical but it fits the story.  I like that Anthony, aka Animalistic, chases after love from Randi, a woman who commands his respect.  Once he finally gets her heart they still go through changes but fight for love all the way to the end.  Anyone who has a heart would like this book.  And no, unlike a previous reviewer suggested about others, I'm not friends with the author, I just think she wrote a good book.  I definitely reccommend this.	2005-04-28

The situations are timeless so I could relate to thinking some of the same things when I was a teenager.  First love, first broken heart, wanting a guy that you shouldn't, etc.  This is not the best book I've ever read but to be fair I am older than the audience this book is geared towards.  There are a few sexual situations in the book but in my opinion, they're handled responsibly and it is not graphic.  So in all, I think \\"Summer Boys\\" is a good, quick read for teenagers around 14 and up. I would even read the sequel coming up \\"Summer Boys 2\\".	2005-04-25

A Perfect Title For A Good Book	I thought that \\"Flipside Of The Game\\" was very entertaining.  You'll laugh, find yourself saying \\"um hum girl\\", and feeling sorry for some of the characters at the same time.  The story is about Vera and how she thinks that she's going to be a lifetime player but love finds her and hits her right in the heart through a man named Taj.  At times I thought the story jumped around a bit too much but the last several chapters made up for it and things started coming together.  This story is an example of your upbringing either making or breaking you.  It had good lessons on your past not dictating your future.  I will definitely be reading this book's sequel.	2005-04-18

Martin and started reading it before I read the synopsis on the back.  I was about 30 or so pages into the book and laid it down.  That's when I saw that it was a sequel to \\"A Hood Legend\\".  So I went back and read \\"A Hood Legend\\" first.  Make sure you do that or else \\"Menage's Way\\" will have a lot of unanswered questions for you. <br /> <br />Now to my review of \\"A Hood Legend\\".  It's set in Miami with the main character being a man named Menage Unique Legend.  He's a hustler as well as a player and claims that once he makes his million dollars he's out of the game.  There's also a lot of drama surrounding him with friends, foes, and females.  That's the majority of what the book is about.  No new subject here.  With this type of genre your book has to set itself apart from all the other imitators out there.  I think that Mr. Martin accomplished setting himself apart to a certain extent but he still has more work.  I enjoyed the Menage character the majority of the time, he seemed like a decent guy that just got caught up.  I didn't enjoy the constant name-dropping - Prada this, Gucci that, it got to be a bit much.  Overall though, I think this book deserves some attention.  I will definitely go back and read the sequel \\"Menage's Way\\".   <br /> <br />I'm not sure if Mr. Martin is incarcerated at this time but if he is please continue to keep God in your heart and a positive mind that will help you put out these novels.  If I am mistaken and Mr. Martin isn't incarcerated, I wish him the exact same blessings and much future success.	2005-04-14

This book brings the drama from page one.  This story had well thought out characters and situations.  I liked how the chapters started with the main character, Sarai's bank balances.  Sarai was far from perfect in her materialistic views and while I may not have gone as far as she did to make ends meet we all have at one time or another thought of ways to stretch that checkbook like plastic man until payday.  Sarai realized her mistakes and they cost her dearly.   <br /> <br />Buy this book for the beginning, middle, and end.

I couldn't wait to get this book because the title and subject matter drew me in.  As I started reading I became disappointed.   <br /> <br />The storyline had potential from the beginning but never met that potential.  You can tell that the author has taken great care in her \\"technical\\" writing skills but that's where the positive aspects stop.  When I read a book I not only want it to be written free of typing and grammatical errors but also make me feel the characters coming off the page.  Ms. DuPree attempts to have a cast of main characters whose lives intertwine either directly or indirectly.  It's a lofty idea but it didn't work.  I just felt like I was reading a book of short stories.  Just when you think you're getting a glimpse of a character and the reasons for their actions the book jumps to another character.  It's ok to do this but only if it's relevant to the story and there's a natural flow in jumping around. <br /> <br />Another thing that I could have done without is that in about two-thirds of the way through this book the characters turned preachy.  I don't mean in a biblical sense, I don't mind that. I'm talking about the characters trying to sum up the breakdown of families and other social ills in a single chapter.  There's nothing wrong with trying to put a message in your books but having the very same characters that are criminals or sleeping around being bad in one chapter and Al Sharpton in the next is just not believable within the confines of this story.   <br /> <br />The ending was anticlimatic.  The epilogue was unnecessary, usually there'll be some type of unexpected twist but this one was a no-brainer. <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, I think that this book had great potential, there are some good chapters, but the author didn't write a seamless story.  That's a must if you use multiple main characters.  I support many types of African-American fiction from male and female authors but I will always give my reviews in an honest manner in hopes that my opinions are helpful to Amazon customers as well as the authors themselves.  I hope Ms. Dupree reads this and heeds my advice because she missed the mark on this one.  Hopefully she'll accept constructive criticism and improve on her next book.  Good luck.	2005-03-24

Carl Weber has a unique writing style in his novels in that each chapter tells the story from the character's point of view that heads up the chapter.  \\"The Preacher's Son\\" flows in the same manner as his other books.  You don't want to put it down.  The ending was a bit too close to a soap opera for me but this is still a good read.   <br /> <br />I like how Mr. Weber always gives a reading guide for the novel as well as a sneak peek at his next novel at the end of his books.  He practically makes book clubs put his titles on their reading lists.  This author is very smart.  Mr. Weber also tends to have recurring characters, sometimes I remember them but I read so many books that unless they're major characters my memory fails me.  Another smart marketing move, he makes you want to go back and reread or buy for the first time some of his earlier work.  I am not mad at you Mr. Weber.  Keep doing your thing!!   <br /> <br />For all those Amazon readers out there looking to read good African-American fiction, buy this book, you will get your money's worth.	2005-03-22

I like to read young adult fiction from time to time because it helps me remember that I was a teen once and that many times you really get a raw deal during these years.   <br /> <br />From the title alone you know that Ruby has lost her mother but the character is not at all what I expected.  Ruby has to move from the east to the west coast because her mother dies.  The only lifelines to the east coast are Ruby's boyfriend and best friend, will their long distance relationship last?  It's the way that the story is told in poems and e-mails that make it an interesting read.  The story is cohesive even being written in this style that's becoming more and more popular. <br /> <br />The ending with Ruby's father is a little predictable but heartfelt nonetheless.  This is a great read that I encourage anyone to give a try.	2005-02-21

But I didn't want to tell all my friends about it either.  \\"The Broker\\" is not one of Grisham's legal thrillers and is not as suspenseful as say \\"The Firm\\" but it was an ok read.  I like the aspect of having Italy as a backdrop for the broker to hide for a little while but the storyline didn't really go anywhere.  The so called \\"romance\\" that developed between the broker and Francesca was also too little too late.  Grisham attempted a big buildup for the ending bit it was very anticlimatic.  The more I read from Grisham the less I am starting to expect from him.  Save your money and borrow this from the library like I did, you'll thank yourself afterwards.	2005-02-18

But just because the reading is quick that doesn't always mean it's great. \\"Every Boy's Got One\\" just wasn't as exciting as Ms. Cabot's two previous adult fiction novels that follow this format. Girl elopes in Italy, maid of honor (main character and best friend) tries to make sure wedding takes place without a hitch, best man (groom's best friend) doesn't believe in love forever but hopefully will come around. This story didn't really gel, maybe because the main character was annoying, or because the author tried to paint a fiction picture around what really happened with her elopement. After reading the little black book at the end, I see what she was trying to convey but the book just came across as one of those jokes where \\"you had to be there\\". Hopefully Ms. Cabot will continue to write more books in this format but write in a manner where the storyline doesn't seem rushed. I would definitely read another one of her books. I suggest you borrow this from the library.	2005-02-16

This is a quick read that will have you rooting for the love that just may not be meant to be due to circumstances out of the main character's control.  The ending was bittersweet, I don't want to spoil it for anyone but just know that Tony and Natasha both rise above society's expectations from people that come from their environment.  I highly recommend this novel to readers of all ages and look forward to more from this author.	2005-02-16

It could be because I am just reading too many \\"thug tales\\" at one time.  This genre will be just about dead if someone doesn't step it up and put a new twist on the same old story.  Drug dealer lives it up, has millions of women, wakes up and realizes he wants out, loses family and crew in the process.  How many ways can you tell this story?  I think I'll have to put these types of books down for a minute.  Buy this only if you haven't read other books just like it or just want a quick read of drugs, sex, and murder.	2005-01-23

At first I thought Shannon was a woman because of the detail about how slick the women were in the book and also there was no picture on the back of the book to show otherwise.  When I found out it was a man that wrote that book my respect level went a little bit higher for Mr. Holmes.  Since then he has never disappointed me with any of his books.  The same holds true with \\"Never Go Home Again\\". Shannon is not playing with this writing thing and his skills just keep getting better.   <br /> <br />\\"Never Go Home Again\\" is not your typical drug story where the male is from a single-parent home with nothing but the streets to take care of him.  This book is written from the perspective of what happens to a large majority of our young black men.  The main character, Corey, comes from a loving two-parent household but still gets caught up in the drug game.  His parents are so busy working trying to provide a good life for him that the lure of the streets and pressure from his friends draw him in.  Corey's mom and dad are not on dope, they don't beat him, and yet he still sees the fast money that can be made in the streets.  You know that Corey is smart and was raised right but he just makes the wrong choices in life which lead him to an unfortunate end.  This is a perfect example of people trying to raise a young black male in the best way that they know how but society says that their child's worth is different because of the color of his skin. <br /> <br />All I have to say is I have much love for Shannon in writing this book and think everyone should read it.  This book seems to be semi-autographical of Shannon's life from what I've read about him.  The difference is that Shannon chose to make a change after being in the streets and in jail with something that he thought he would never do in a million years.  He chose to pick up a pen and write about the circumstances of the inner city, what the characters do to survive, and give a message of how you'll end up if you choose to make the same choices.  Keep up the good work Shannon.  I'm ready for \\"B-More Careful 2\\". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-22

There is no building of characters, no climax.  You either step right in and enjoy the ride or get off.   <br /> <br />The main character is such a hard nut to crack.  There are some authors who want you to empathize wth the characters and you are drawn into the story.  Mr. Burke does the opposite, he intentionally keeps the main character distant.  You never really get inside of what he's like, only a glimpse that he does have feelings when he carries on a relationship with an HIV positive female.  <br /> <br />The book wasn't very long and reads like snapshots.  You'll get your focus but then it's gone.  You'll either finish this book and stick with it because reading this chaos is manageable or you'll put it down out of frustration that it's all over the place.  There's no middle ground with it.  I invite you to give it a try and if you finish it I can guarantee you won't forget it.	2005-01-22
US	34766942	R3KCSBQ6HZ9GI	1593090358	617119301	Cracked Dreams	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Good Debut But.....	As a whole, I thought \\"Cracked Dreams\\" was written well.  You can tell that the author took his time to make sure the writing was on point.  But then that leaves the storyline.  There was nothing new here to make this book stand out from the oversaturation of urban fiction out there right now.   <br /> <br />I, like many other fans of this genre, have been reading the urban fiction of the new millenium where Iceberg Slim and Donald Goines left off.  I'm talkin' since Sister Souljah had to fight to get the \\"Coldest Winter Ever\\" in major bookstores and Terri Woods was selling books out of the trunk of her car while  staying \\"True To The Game\\".  Since those 5 or 6 years have passed there have been many books put out just to jump on the \\"hood tale\\" bandwagon.   <br /> <br />Now with that said, I'll repeat that I feel \\"Cracked Dreams\\" was written by a true author that did his homework but he gave you nothing new.  Boy lives in the hood, boy has a crew, boy and crew decide to make money in the drug game, boy and crew live it up, boy and crew die.  Tell me what's new about that.  I don't mind reading these books as long as there's some type of new spin on it.  You have to keep these storylines fresh.  I think that Michael Baptiste is a promising author and challenge him to do better next time.  We all have to start somewhere.	2005-01-22

No problem doing so with \\"MOB\\".  Right from the first page you are pulled onto a roller coaster ride of crime, then love, and finally suspense.  The book is written in vivid detail with the right amount of emotion poured into each character without being overdone.  I especially liked the fact that one of the MOB crew members is a woman whose name is Jackie.  She holds her own right alongside the guys.  I can definitely see this book being put on the big screen with the type of action that comes from these heists. <br /> <br />There are some characters and references that may have come from \\"Is It A Crime\\" (i.e. Mike Black) but you can still read this book in spite of that minor detail.  I appreciate the author writing the story in that manner and may even go back and try to read \\"Is It A Crime\\".    <br /> <br />I can't wait until \\"Drug Related\\" is released to see if it picks up on the Jackie and Travis storyline.  Buy this book, it won't disappoint.	2005-01-12

I laughed out loud at some of Jordan's thoughts.  Her roommate Terry livens up this book and proves to be a friend to the end.  The book keeps you guessing to the end about the murder and has a nice twist. <br /> <br />Cons - The \\"Hattie\\" character.  What purpose did she serve?  Everytime Jordan was about to get on the bus I would cringe because then I'd have to read Miss Hattie's words.  Was she supposed to represent the witch in Snow White?  Eve in the Garden of Eden?  There was just no need for this character.  Jordan was a bit too naive even for a fictional character.  Everyone around her lied to her face, including her roommate, and she picked up on nothing.  I also didn't like how Ms. Handfield would try to throw certain words in a sentence to let us know she owns a dictionary.  Many of the words were filler and seemed forced as well as unecessary.  In your next book just let the words flow and never try to patronize the reader. <br /> <br />All in all I give the book 4 stars instead of three because it was a pretty quick read and kept me entertained.	2005-01-02

The chapters move at a pretty fast pace.  This book describes the Hamptons to a \\"t\\" from the Jitney (sp?) bus to the socialites scrambling around to host the biggest parties and charity events.  I liked how the three girls came together but wish it would have happened sooner than at the end of the book.  Those interested in fashion will start salivating when reading about the fashion sale that happens every summer.  That was one of my favorite parts.  Buy this book if you're into reading magazines like US Weekly, Star, or InTouch.  You'll definitely relate.	2005-01-01

In my opinion before you even pick up \\"Shakey's Loose\\" by Renay Jackson you have to read the first book in this series, \\"Oaktown Devil\\".  \\"Oaktown Devil\\" is set in 90's Oakland, CA and one of the main characters is a thug nicknamed Bucky who kills people to get to the top.  His supporting cast is hilarious.  Again this is set in the 90's so if you're a young buck (no pun intended), you may not get everything Renay's talking about but keep reading, it'll make sense.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was kind of skeptical of a follow up because the characters in \\"Oaktown Devil\\" were a trip and most of their fate's were not good by the end of the book.  Well Shakey, who is Bucky's brother, gets out of jail wanting to get back with his ex Cassandra who is now engaged to Rainbow.  New characters are introduced as well as old ones that make a comeback.  Shakey has better hygiene than his brother Bucky but is still just as ignorant.  His best friend Slack helps him get back into the life of crime.  I'll stop here and just say read this book only AFTER you read \\"Oaktown Devil\\".<br /><br />One more thing.  Cassandra is a trip in \\"Shakey's Loose\\".  You'll see what happens when she takes Rainbow on a bus trip to Reno.  I can't wait until \\"Turf War\\" comes out in January to see what happens next.  I'm not sure if this series is a reprint or what but whatever the case may be I am a Renay Jackson fan for life!	2005-01-01

There was drama nonstop within this beauty salon and I'm sure many of us could relate to sitting in the salon for hours, hearing the gossip, talking about men, and catty envy between star stylists.   <br /> <br />I liked how the story ended and give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because of editing.  I know the authors must get sick of hearing it.  One Triple Crown author (not this one) even had the nerve to actually mention in a recent collection of short stories that she was tired of hearing about the bad editing.  Well do something about it!!  Like it or not, editing reflects on the author's work.  I understand that the author is not the editor but when we read these books you've already cosigned for your editor.  There's no excuse for Charly being spelled \\"Charlie\\" over and over, or having a scene in the book where Ishmael was with Robin but then the editor messes up and puts Nina's name in the mix.  Tighten up Triple Crown editors, you've gotten better but still have a long way to go if you want to be taken seriously.	2004-12-19

I think because the other one was about her :-)  This was a pretty quick read for me but only because I don't listen to Wendy's show so all of these interviews were new to me.   <br /> <br />I didn't like it when Wendy would mention an interview she had with someone and then say well I can't put it in the book (i.e. Judge Mathis, entire World interview, etc.).  Why bring it up then?  I also didn't like how she flip flops.  She'll talk about someone being careless with money but then she's on the waiting list for a 6,000 dollar purse.  She talks about Lil' Kim's surgery but she's been under the knife more than a steak at Sizzler.  She talks about controlling men but has married her own version of Suge Knight.   <br /> <br />My favorite interviews were with Wordell (sp?) who was the Puffy limo driver, Suge Knight (even though it was sketchy) and Whitney Houston because she was talking like she was smokin' right then. <br /> <br />How You Doin' was another good chapter.  Wendy has had everyone speculating for years who the gay rapper is but she also keeps it real letting you know there's many more in the closet than we the public think there is. <br /> <br />Bottom line, only buy the book if you're a newbie to her interviews and a fan.  If you've heard it all before then borrow it from a friend or the library just for a good laugh.	2004-12-16

Oaktown Devil was so good, one of those finish it in a day because you can't put it down type books.   <br /> <br />When I first started reading it I was like what in the world?  I guess I was expecting a modern urban tale.  The main character started the book off trying to describe his mack game but he clearly was not in 2004, more like the early 90s.  This was back in the day of thick gold link and herringbone chains, airbrushed jeans and tees, and skypagers.  But once I got past that and into the book there was no stopping.  This book was funny as I don't know what.  Something for everybody.  Urban drama with a tiny bit of mystery mix.  Oaktown Devil is probably even more of a treat for Bay area residents because of the descriptions of streets and hangouts in their hometown.  Even some Too Short lyrics thrown in for good measure.   <br /> <br />Just buy this book, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  I'll be starting the sequel \\"Shakey's Loose\\" shortly.  Renay Jackson, you got a fan for life.	2004-12-16

I chose it primarily because of the e-mail format writing style that so far only a few authors have explored.   <br /> <br />This is a coming of age story that gives you the transition of a teenage girl towards the end of her senior year in high school on to her first months of college towards the end of the book.  The storyline is very relatable for those of us who have had their heart broken, those of us who've fallen in love with someone for who we think they are, and it's also a story of thinking you know everything about your family and not really knowing as much as you thought. <br /> <br />I think this book is worth the money because it's a good, fast read that has a surprising ending you may not expect.	2004-12-16

The romantic-suspense style that it is written in is very misleading.  At times you don't know if you're reading fact or fiction.  [...]this book has the nerve to give specific thoughts of each person.  [...] This book implies that Kobe is such a confused loner that the only way he feels good is if he comes on to every white, female hotel employee he encounters and then rapes them.  Sound harsh?  That's what this book leads you to belive.  As of this writing the alleged victim would not testify in court against Kobe and the judge dismissed the charges.  I don't recommend buying this book, it doesn't tell you anything you haven't already heard and is just making money off of this situation.  I'm not saying Kobe is innocent or guilty, what I am saying is that this book is a one-sided account of what the \\"authors\\" guess happened that night.  [...] The last chapter wants you to imagine Mr. Lonely Kobe, the boogeyman, calling up female employees for room service and then raping them once they get inside. [...].	2004-12-03

I think Nikki Turner's story, which was the first, was also the best.  The editors must have known that also considering the book went downhill from her story.  The stories were just a little far fetched even for \\"hood stories\\".  If you just like the short story format I recommend \\"A Dollar And A Dream\\" and \\"Around The Way Girls\\" instead of this.	2004-11-27

This book also had pretty good jokes from the main character.  The reason I gave the book 3 stars though is near the end of the book this thing just went all over the place.  I know the author was trying to send a positive message out but I started getting confused because I was like \\"ok has this book turned from fiction to nonfiction, is the author writing about himself or what?\\"  It's ok to take pieces of reality and put it into fiction but this just got crazy.  Although I was disappointed towards the end of the book, I would still recommend at least borrowing this from someone and reading it if you don't buy it yourself.	2004-11-11

Let me just say that I read Ms. Spencer's book \\"Cubicles\\" and absolutely LOVED it so when I saw that she had another book coming out I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  As I started reading this book I was like What In The -- is my girl Camika doing?  The plot was way out there, I couldn't imagine these ladies taking a book author hostage and nothing happening.  This book read like some type of Lifetime movie.  I finally stopped trying to make sense of it and read it for what it was, just fantasy type thinking and then it was better.  Maybe Ms. Spencer knows a particular black, male author that she thinks this should happen to :-)  I went ahead and finished the book since it was short.  I will say that even though I finished this book, if she continues to write books like this, I will not be purchasing another one.  My advice to those of you reading this review is to buy \\"Cubicles\\" first if you haven't already and then borrow \\"He Had It Coming\\" from the library.	2004-11-11

When I read the first chapter I thought \\"Oh no!  I'm going to have to keep a box of tissues next to me, this is going to be depressing!\\"  Actually, \\"Home To Italy\\" was the complete opposite.  The author's writing style flows in such an easy, laidback manner that you can't help but want to finish it.  The writing is not rushed but it doesn't drag either.  Nothing is forced like so many authors try to do today.<br /><br />I won't tell you the entire story but the gist of it is that the main character, Peppi, loses his wife and decides to go \\"home to Italy\\".  He meets his best friend's daughter, Lucrezia, who is a spitfire.  She hides behind a wall of agressiveness because she has a broken heart.<br /><br />Through Peppi's homecoming the author invites you to visualize this country's landscape, people, smells, and culture with Peppi's love of bike riding as a backdrop.  All of the characters have distinct personalities that fit the piece of this book puzzle.  You don't wonder the relevance of any character in the book.  Even the two train riders Peppi meets on his way home help to weave this story together for Peppi and Lucrezia.  Subtle humor is carefully placed throughout many of the situations.  I like the idea of Peppi and Lucrezia finding love again even when they try their best to fight it.  I also like the way the author has you visualize this love blooming without writing a bunch of sex scenes to taint your visualizations.<br /><br />Great book with a great ending.  I see a movie script here and look forward to reading more works from this author.  Buy this book, you won't be disappointed.	2004-10-23

Joseph is a very talented writer.  His characters in this book are well developed in terms of the roles they play in the book.  I like that the chapters are told from the point of view of the character it's named after.  Humor plays a large role in the situations that occur and Mr. Joseph does a good job with it.  I liked the ending that let you know what happened to each character.  Also the editing was pretty good as far as grammar and spelling.  I only noticed a few mistakes but I've seen much worse and hope that all African-American books strive toward error free editing. <br /> <br />Cons - Many times the book didn't move fast enough for me in terms of how the characters would solve their problems.  I found myself often thinking \\"Enough already, let's get on with it.\\"  There was a lot of repetitivenes, such as in Ahmad and Shay's relationship that just got on my nerves.   <br /> <br />I wish this author much success and hope he continues to grow as a writer.  There's always room for improvement so I look forward to reading his next book and hoping he stepped his game up even higher than it is.	2004-10-08

I've read all of Mary Monroe's books and will continue if her writing stays as consistent as she has shown in Red Light Wives.  Ms. Monroe writes in a unique style that I can't really describe but that you know when you read her books.  It's something in the words she uses to describe her characters and their thoughts that makes you feel she writes things that people think but wouldn't dare say. <br /> <br />I liked reading each chapter from the female's point of view that the chapter was titled.  My favorite character hands down was Helen Daniels.  I laughed out loud at some of the stuff she said and thought about Rocky.  She was sharper than a lot of the other characters gave her credit for. <br /> <br />True Mary Monroe fans will appreciate this effort while new fans will want to go back and read her other works.  I have to admit that God Don't Like Ugly is still my favorite but this book also did a good job with character development.  As always when I finish her books much too quickly because I can't put them down, I'm ready for another book from this author!	2004-09-21

It was a bit predictable in places and read more like an episode of a cop show than I would have liked but was still entertaining.  I could see this on the big screen.  There were times that I thought the story could have moved a little faster.  The love between Jamal and Keisha was sweet but a little unbelievable in how it unfolded.   <br /> <br />I liked the ending and would even recommend this book to a friend but with the warning that you have to stick with it and don't give up on it.	2004-09-13

I admire her for writing a love story with African-American characters without stereotypes that are so prevalent in many books out today.  The characters were from all walks of life and written with such care that I couldn't put this book down.  You'll find yourself rooting for Jason and Kyra.  There's nothing like the feeling of a first love.   <br /> <br />I would definitely read something from this author again.  Buy this book, you won't be disappointed.	2004-09-10

Omar Tyree used to be one of my favorite writers but as the years go on he displays more and more inconsistency in his writing.  Writing with the pen name \\"The Urban Griot\\" and trying to be a part of the latest urban fiction genre does not hide the fact that this book was extremely weak in terms of character development and the lack of believable situations.  I am clearly in the minority in comparison to the other reviewers but that's ok, everyone's entitled to their opinion. <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this book two stars is because the chapters were fairly short and I managed to get to the end of the book.  I know that this is a work of fiction but this story was way out there.  What expert hit man, in this case the main character Molasses, tells all of his business to women that he barely knows?  Molasses was too flamboyant to be a successful hit man.  The way he acted he should have been killed in the first chapter.  The girl, I think her name is Janeia, would have made a better hit man.  I also didn't believe what happened to him at the end.  Once again, an expert hit man would not have come upon the surprise that he did. <br /> <br />Suggestion to Mr. \\"Urban Griot\\", leave this genre alone and please go back to writing interesting characters.  Examples of your best work would be Flyy Girl, Sweet St. Louis, and Single Mom.  I don't think this type of writing is for you.	2004-09-10

I think you will too if you like the type of fiction that feeds your appetite for the quirky world of the entertainment industry.  What the assistants in Hollywood have to go through is nothing more than modern day indentured servitude.  Nevertheless they complete these ridiculous tasks for their bosses because they also want to get ahead and will get the chance to act like a jerk to their assistant.  It's a neverending cycle. <br /> <br />The humor in this book is just right.  It's not forced and the book flows at a good pace.  I liked each character but one of my favorites, Griffin, had the following thought about one of his client's wife - \\"...Anne jets into the room.  I wonder how long she's been preparing to make this Grand Entrance.  It's clear she has spent hours putting on makeup to hide the fact that she's been spending time under a bridge scaring the three Billy Goats Gruff.\\"  That's just classic, I wasn't expecting it and it made me laugh out loud.  <br /> <br />The characters all had great endings that were believable.  I hated for this book to end.  I hope this author has another novel in the works.  I can definitely see this book being turned into a movie. <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you're a frequent reader of US Weekly, InTouch, and Star magazines then buy this book.  It will really give you an insider's look of what it takes to be an assistant in the entertainment industry.	2004-09-02

I SO wanted to love this book but ended up just thinking it was ok.  The storyline jumped around too much for my taste.  I like sarcasm and dry wit as much as the next person but the authors laid it on too thick, it was like reading a nonstop Seinfeld episode. You also have to really pay attention to the qotation marks because you don't know if Jess is speaking to someone or just having the sarcastic conversations in her head.    <br /> <br />After all that said there are some genuinely good and funny parts in the book but most of it is forced.  The authors prove that's two heads aren't always better than one.  If this book would have toned down on all the sarcasm and kept a steady story line it could have been great.  I say borrow this book from the library and save your money.	2004-08-23

The chapters were quick to read and included flashback moments for each of the characters that added to the story. <br />  <br /> Lauren - The young wife of a billionaire who tries to avoid the limelight in spite of having friends that want to stay in it. She was raised in an upper middle class home with parents that tried to instill a sense of independence in her but that independence takes a nosedive once she marries Ed. Being the wife of a billionaire doesn't bring too many good friends as she finds out by being too trusting for her own good. <br />  <br /> Tandy - Older socialite who has lost not only her youth but her money as well. She grew up in money and honestly believes she's entitled to be rich and privileged. When it comes to money and social status she would run over her first born and step over her to get it. Despite that, she's one of the funniest characters in the book. <br />  <br /> Manny - The gay &quot;friend&quot; of Lauren and Tandy. Unlike Tandy and Lauren, he didn't grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth but like Tandy, he's out for self and will use his friend to get it. <br />  <br /> For those who know, this story is very true in terms of how important status and class is in New York. The ending of this book was wrapped up a little too neatly for my taste but overall Gotham Diaries is a good read. I would definitely recommend this book.	2004-08-06

I enjoyed &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; for many reasons:  <br />  <br /> I like that EJD chose to write with a plot involving scams, murder and suspense like he did with &quot;Thieve's Paradise&quot;. The main character Driver gets caught up with married lover Lisa. She is a psycho to the tenth power. Reading about how she kept up with Driver's every move just made me shudder to think how easy it is for a person to stalk you if they choose.  <br />  <br /> I like that the backdrop is Los Angeles. Although EJD is not originally from Los Angeles, he's lived there long enough to have effortlessly captured in his novels the love-hate relationship you can easily develop for this city. You can't really describe it, you just have to live there to understand and appreciate his descriptions. <br />  <br /> I like that there is an appearance of characters from his previous books such as Arizona, Pam, and Panther. One of my favorite characters was Rufus who is too funny for words.  <br />  <br /> I like the twists and turns the story takes even when you're sure you have everything figured out.  <br />  <br /> I just liked the book overall and give it a solid five stars. It's one of those books that you don't want to finish reading but you rush through just to see what happens next.  <br />  <br /> I'm ready for another dose of EJD. The man is a great author who really takes the time to write books that the majority of black people can relate to in one way or another. Although I like when he switches it up with a suspense novel I'm hoping the next one goes back to his roots and deals with relationships.	2004-07-31

I know I'm in the minority here but I have to give my honest opinion on The Root Of All Evil. It reads like a first draft.  The plot and characters are all over the place.  There were too many storylines going on at once and then the last third of the book tried to muster up all kinds of twists and turns that just weren't believable.  <br />  <br />I don't think this author's writing is terrible, it just needs work in terms of story flow and character development.  Maybe hiring an editor that will give honest opinions would help.   <br /> <br />I borrowed this book from the library and would consider borrowing the sequel if it's ordered.  If not, there's no way I would buy it, too big of a risk for my hard earned dollars.  But if you're a risk taker then be my guest in buying this book and don't say I didn't warn you.	2004-07-24

If you like Jackie Collins' style of fictional entertainment writing (which I do), then Bling is the book for you.  I have to admit that the storyline doesn't really bring anything new, you won't have a hard time figuring out what's going to happen next.  I also borrowed this from the library because it's not a classic that I want on my bookshelf.  With all that said, Bling is still a fun, summer read.  I think the publishing timing is perfect. <br />Bling gives you an insider view of the music industry, hip hop in particular.  In reading this, it's fun to associate some of the characters with real life celebrities.  I thought it was very smart of Ms. Kennedy to drop real life celebrity references such as P-Diddy and Beyonce' just to let the readers know that this book is not entirely about them but rather a hodgepodge of hip hop and R&amp;B artists in the industry.  <br />At times the author will throw in words that just don't fit in the context of the book, it's like she wants us to know that she owns a dictionary.  I'm all for using and learning new words but it came off as forced in this book.  <br />Bottom line, I give the book a solid four stars just because I like reading industry tales.  Miramax has already given the option to make this a movie so read the book first and hope that &quot;Bling&quot; won't be the next &quot;Glitter&quot;.  Happy reading!!	2004-07-17

I can not understand how reviewers gave this book four and five stars.  I do understand that this author has many friends in the African-American literary world so that may be a reason for so many good reviews.  Just read her acknowledgments pages, I can't believe out of all the wonderful authors she named, no one had the guts to tell her to go back to the lab with this one.  The subject of this novel accomplished what it set out to do, and that's make the audience curious.  How would Tracey try to justify sleeping with her teenage daughter's boyfriend?  That's where it ends, with that question.  Once you start reading this book you'll have no definitive answers because the characters have no depth, you will not be sympathetic to their plight.  <br />Tracey made me sick, she didn't have a lick of sense.  She ran behind one man to the point of stalking and then took her daughter's man with absolutely no regard for her daughter's feelings whatsoever.  How are we as readers supposed to empathize at all with this woman?  The plot was long and drawn out with unbelievable situations.  As dumb as Tracey and Aaron were with their so called &quot;sneaking&quot; around, someone would have found out about them much sooner.  <br />The best character was Regis Collier and she's the reason I gave the book two stars instead of one.  Unfortunately, you only got to read a little bit about her.  I was able to stomach the &quot;Lauren&quot; chapters but whenever I saw &quot;Tracey&quot; or &quot;Aaron&quot; as the chapter headings I knew I would read really fast.  I don't know how I finished this book but I did.    <br />I can not in good conscience say buy this book, it's better off borrowed.	2004-07-07

I don't know what to really say about this book.  I'm a big fan of chick lit that dishes about the entertainment industry but the genre as a whole is becoming very stale.  This book doesn't help bring in new fans.  It was way too long and drawn out, the storyline was all over the place, and the pieces just didn't fit.  You know how you're completing a jigsaw puzzle and you're down to the last few pieces and you try to make them fit?  That's sorta what this book is like.  <br />I still give the book a generous 2.5 stars because I liked the subject matter, just not the way it was written overall.  I even smiled at the ending, but that could have been because I actually finished the book and not because it was clever.  In my opinion, hardcover book money is too hard to come by so utilize your tax dollars and check this out of your local library.	2004-07-02

I, along with my previous reviewers, agree that Ms. Tramble has done a wonderful job with The Last King as a sequel to The Dying Ground.  I came upon The Dying Groud by accident and discovered a treasure.<br />In The Last King we are reunited with Maceo Redfield who has grown as a man.  His exterior is tougher but you still feel his vulnerabilities that lie beneath the surface.  I really enjoyed revisiting old characters as well as being introduced to new ones.  I feel like I know these people and will readily admit that I missed Daddy Al, Gra'mere, and the aunts being more involved in this sequel but I understand their absence.  This novel to me was more about Maceo coming to grips with past actions that deeply affected his friends and family.  I'm sure his family will play a more prominent role in future novels.<br />Ms. Tramble has not lost her &quot;pitching arm&quot; in continuing to describe the city of Oakland at the time period that this novel is placed.  In reading the descriptions of the city and it's surroundings you feel like you're riding along in the truck with Maceo and Kiros.<br />If you haven't already had the pleasure of experiencing this author's writing and enjoy books that make you feel for the characters, please start with The Dying Ground.  After you have taken that book trip continue on your journey with The Last King.  You will not be disappointed.<br />Hats off to you Ms. Tramble.  The Last King was worth the wait and I look forward to the next novel in this series.  May you have continued success.	2004-07-02

All I can do is sing with the previous choir of reviewers and say that this is an excellent book.  <br />As in all of her previous novels, Mrs. Whetstone manages to capture the essence (no pun intended) of strong community on the pages of &quot;Leaving Cecil Street&quot;.  Sights, sounds, and attitudes all carry you away as you're swept along with the characters of Cecil Street.  <br />What will you find on Cecil Street?  An assortment of black characters that we all know in one way or another. The women gossiping in the hair salon, the men gossibping in the barbershop, the bad corner boys who take time from doing dirt to go and sing on the corner each evening, kids jumping double dutch, the hot heffa from down south ready to take someone's man.  But at the end of the day these people all care about each other and stick together.  <br />Be ready for your emotions to be taken on a roller coaster ride as you laugh, cry, and just want to say &quot;shet your mouth&quot; at the way the story unfolds.  There are some things that you expect but not in the way you think it'll happen.  <br />As with her previous novels, I did not want Mrs. Whetstone's book to end.  This book was a long time coming but definitely worth the wait.  I'm already anticipating the next one.<br />Bottom line, buy this book, it's worth every penny.	2004-06-26

Can we get one book from the urban fiction genre that has good editing?  <br />The Richmond, VA references that Nikki gives in her books are always on point and she didn't disappoint in that aspect.  I also liked the fact that the main character, Tressa wasn't just some around the way chickenhead but an intelligent woman trying to make ends meet.  But the situations weren't new which didn't make it a page turner for me.  The ending was pretty good so that earned a star by itself.<br />With all that said I would still read another book from this author, she has potential.  I just wouldn't buy the book, I'd check it out of the library.	2004-05-31

As an avid Precious Ramotswe fan this book was like a fast food version of the series I've grown to love.  There were parts that made me laugh but I feel that the character development was a bit overdone this time around if there is such a thing.  Precious didn't seem to be at the center of the book.  The book felt rushed.  I just knew that the something I was missing would come and it never did.  Nice ending but it didn't make up for other things I was missing.  I love Precious for her outlook on life as a woman and as a black African.  That Mr. McCall Smith is able to capture this is nothing short of amazing.  However, this time around I felt Precious' words and those around her were forced.  The beauty of the previous books has been on solving mysteries with compassion, common sense, and a deep love for the surrounding country of Botswana.  I didn't get a feel for the mystery part of the equation this time around.  There was only one mystery that seemed thrown in for good measure and then not even really solved.  I know it's hard for an outhor to constantly live up to making each book better than the last but I have a favor to ask of Mr. McCall Smith.  Please let Precious and all of her supporting cast do what they do best--be themselves.  Many of us feel like we know this woman and all those that surround her so please bring her back to her natural element---being the No. 1 Ladies Detective that Botswana has to offer.  I don't consider this a bad book but would only recommend it if you've already enjoyed the previous books, then you can overlook this tiny stumble.  I'm very hopeful for the next book in this series.	2004-05-12

This novel brought out many emotions in me-anger, sadness, laughter, disgust, heartache.  I didn't know if I could finish this novel, it was emotionally hard for me to read but I had to know what happens to Precious.  As I was reading, all I could think of was how many young children are in the same or even worse of a situation that Precious was in?  The vulgar language hits you in the face but is necessary to tell this story.  Sometimes the vulgarity will make you laugh, most of the time it will make you want to cry.  Bittersweet ending but worth the read ten times over.  Excellent book.	2004-05-03

I didn't go into reading this books for intellectual conversation with a book group, I read it because chick lit is my stress release.  The characters do or say things that many of us think but would never dare say.  Bergdorf Blondes reads like a fictionalized account of Vogue or InStyle without the pictures.  The only problem I had with this book is that it didn't actually go anywhere, by the end I had enough of all of the girls including the nameless lead character.  Some may say that no chick lit book actually goes anywhere but I disagree.  There are many diamonds in the rough, this just isn't it.  I would recommend buying this book only if you enjoyed books like &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot;, anything in the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series, or &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;.  Not that the books are the same, it's just that all have a lot of fashion references and if you can stand reading about Marc Jacobs or Jimmy Choo every other chapter then you're ok.	2004-04-29

I don't think Ashanti really put this out to show that she was some great poet, I think she was told by her handlers to put out one more thing for fans to buy.  Strike while the iron is hot.  This books is for die-hard fans only because they'll be the only ones to really get something out of this.  I found the entries to be redundant and wishy washy.  In one &quot;reflection&quot; Ashanti is trying to tell young ladies they don't need a man, love yourself, and play hard to get.  Then in the next &quot;reflection&quot; she's saying that she wants to be with her boyfriend constantly, it's ok to have a little jealousy in your relationship, she's sneaking out of the house and from school for a guy.  Which examples do you want young ladies to follow?  It's one thing for Ashanti to write about her experiences but if she's trying to pass on lessons at least lead by example.  It sounds like she was doing big girl things at an early age, some girls are mature enough for that but many are not.  I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 solely based on the strength of her fans.  They'll love anything she does like a true fan would, so I can see how they'll eat this up.  Maybe with a little more time and proper editing this would have been much better.	2004-04-27

It is written in a beautiful, even poetic manner.  Heru Ptah gives us all things that hip hop covers - battling, politics, loneliness at the top, your crew, the music industry, philosophy, misogyny, and so many more things that any true hip hop lover will embrace.  Don't get it twisted, this book is long, but you will want to follow it to the end to see what happens.  As you read you'll find resemblances to Tupac and Biggie, God bless the dead.  The book conveys thoughts either one of these great artists may have had when they were living.  This is also a book for those that may not love hip hop, it gives an understanding of the culture.  I commend Heru for writing such an intelligent and thought provoking work of fiction and would like to read more fiction from this author.  All hip hop artists should be required to read this book as an introduction into the industry.  Buy this book, it will be money well spent.	2004-04-18

As I started reading &quot;Black&quot;, the storyline seemed very familiar to me.  After awhile, it came to me.  This book was based on a short story that Tracy Brown had in the book &quot;The Game: Short Stories About Life&quot;.  I remember after reading this as a short story, I couldn't wait to read the entire book.  This book takes Kaia from a child into womanhood without ever receiving love from the person you want it the most - your mother.  Kaia's sisters didn't help her either.  She was definitely emotionally abused all the time she lived in her mother's house.  Despite this horrible abuse, Kaia triumphed as a positive person in her life.  Kaia could have gone so many ways but she stayed true to herself with the help of her boyfriend and friends.  She also finds out that everyone who says they're your friend are not always your friend.  Kaia's boyfriend Aaron is a good guy although he winds up in terrible circumstances.  I was saddened by the ending, not only because of what happens but because the book was coming to a close.  I give this book 4.5 stars instead of 5 stars because of one reason - the numerous grammatical errors.  I love to read urban tales but come on people, let's step up our game on the proofreading issue.  These authors have to put out error free books to compete with mainstream books.  It's condescending to readers to think we won't notice errors.  It also gives those who feel that urban books are a fad, just one more reason to say why these books don't belong in big name bookstores on the display racks. Please print one copy and read it thoroughly to make sure that it's error free before putting so many out to press.  These errors take value away from the book and that's a reflection on the author.  At one point I was reading and an ENTIRE paragraph repeated itself!  This should not happen, you don't see these type of mistakes in mainstream books.  Other than that, this was a fantastic read!  Go out and buy this book!	2004-04-18

I look at home design's books constantly but have never felt compelled to actually buy one until reading Home By Design.  The layout of various design options in this book is great for those who own homes and even for those who wish to own homes in the future.  There were numerous suggestions on how to utilize any living space.  The explanations weren't difficult to understand or patronizing to those of us that aren't interior decorators or architechts.  The photographs are beautiful.  The rooms in the photographs are spacious but not in a far fetched way that some home design books feature.  By that, I mean that you could actually picture some of these rooms in your own home.  I think it's important in home design books to make the reader feel comfortable.  You don't want the book to have a fairy tale vision because it'll end up in a pile of books at some garage sale.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this book.  I will be keeping it as a reference manual in my personal library.	2004-04-10

This book should be required reading for some of our young black males that fall victims to these streets.  You may be on top one minute but you best believe it doesn't stay that way.  These cats had to constantly watch their backs so how can you enjoy the fruits of your labor in that manner?  Good book K'wan.  I'll definitely go back and read Gangsta just on the strength of Road Dawgz.  Keep 'em coming!!	2004-04-04

Crave delivers an honest look in the life of what many single women go through - the desire to be loved for who they are.  This is not to say that every woman needs a man but all of us have a desire to be loved whether it's from family or a significant other.  Michael doesn't always handle her crave for love in the best manner but I think if you take the time to read this book, you'll feel a pleasant resolve to her situation.  Bottom line, buy the book and give it a chance.  For some it may take a few chapters to get into but I'm sure that it will satisfy your crave for a good book.	2004-04-03

I was glad to find out I was wrong.  This book gives very good tips and shines the word &quot;diva&quot; in a whole new light.  I would recommend buying this book.  The advice is classic so you don't have to worry about it going out of style.	2004-03-30

I am not sure what book the other reviewers read but &quot;Cosmopolitan Girls&quot; was not as good as the cover or title lead you to believe.  The way this book read, I am sure each of the writers handled a different character and then tried to meet somewhere in the middle when the main characters were in chapters together.  It just seemed like you were reading separate books.  The storyline drifted all over the place, there was too much designer name-dropping and not enough substance.  Luckily, the chapters are pretty short which is the ONLY reason I was able to finish this book.  The most positive aspects of this novel are that most of the intimate scenes included condom use, which is rare in any novel; also the tips for all women from the authors at the end of the book.  I'm not saying that these ladies are not good writers. I could see where they were trying to bond sisters together in a positive light.  I just thought the story itself was rather weak.  I would read something else from these authors just to see if they improve but I would have to check it out of the library.  Too much of a risk to buy based on this first effort.	2004-03-28

Winston Chapman has definitely held his own with this book.  The reading is fast-paced, has solid editing, and a great main character.  It was a little unrealistic for Raven to accomplish what she did in such a short amount of time but this is a fiction novel and the girl brought her &quot;A&quot; game.  Bottom line, buy this book, you won't be disappointed.	2004-03-28

Sure, some of the story was predictable but aren't most chick lit books fairly predictable?  You read these books for a light, entertaining read with thoughts from characters that say or think what we all say or think.   I loved Emma and her supporting cast.  One of my favorite parts is the goat gift.  That was funny.  Although I don't suffer from being underweight in the least, it was nice to have a character that was actually trying to gain and not lose weight.  Skinny sisters need a voice too.  If you're a chick lit fiend like myself, then you won't be disappointed with this one.  Enjoy!!	2004-03-23

For those of us born before 1980, &quot;Meeting In The Ladies Room&quot; as a title brings memories of the song made famous by the all female group Klymaxx.  Although one has nothing to do with the other, I liked this book just as much as I like that song.  I won't go over the synopsis anymore but just know that this book's flow is as smooth as a river.  The character of Jackie Blue was well developed.  She was an intelligent black woman in the cutthroat business of book publishing, yet she still had faults when it came to men.  I liked that she had flaws as well as a good group of people in her network.  The twist with an unethical reporter seemed to take care of itself a little too neatly but overall this was a great read.  Would highly recommend.	2004-03-16

This novel started off with a bang and then fizzled very quickly.  This was like reading a road map but without a destination.  Having &quot;The Last Juror&quot; as the title was very misleading because I was expecting all types of twists and turns indicative of previous Grisham novels, instead I ended up just grateful that I checked this out of the library.  I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone buy this book.  Please help your local library's circulation numbers and check it out.  It seems that Mr. Grisham's characters are as tired as he is.  Maybe he doesn't want to play the suspense game anymore.  If that's the case Mr. Grisham please stop writing novels under the cloak of legal suspense and call it a wrap.	2004-03-15

If I have to pick a favorite out of the three it would be &quot;Played&quot; by Dwayne S. Joseph.  Although the stories were written with an urban backdrop, the characters weren't letting their surrounding define them, they were trying to make it like anyone else.  Each story was believable.  Another plus to reading this book is the editing.  Too many &quot;urban tales&quot; take for granted that readers will overlook typos and grammatical errors.  I take offense to that.  Black people like to read and we would like to do so without fighting through bad editing.  Thanks to all three authors for the care that was put into making these stories possible.  I will definitely support their future works.	2004-03-15

I have to call them like I see them and I don't see 5 stars for this book.  I read &quot;Nappily Ever After&quot; many months ago and loved it.  I was very disappointed in &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot; as a sequel.  The best character is Jake who everyone will compare to P-Diddy when reading.  Unfortunately he didn't get the voice he should have, he was playing backup to Venus with her unnecessary drama.  I didn't feel that the author brought Venus to life as she did in &quot;Nappily Ever After&quot;.  A sequel should have at least a little bit of growth in the main character, yet Venus has gone backwards almost to the point of going in the womb.  It took the ENTIRE book for Venus to GET IT which is fine if the book wasn't all over the place.  Why didn't I sympathize and relate to Venus in this book?  I didn't enjoy her having a constant chip on her shoulder, nor did I enjoy her not being able to make one solid, adult decision.  Ms. Thomas may have written her in this way to show that she still hasn't thawed out from the devastation that Clint caused but all I could think of while reading was RELAX!!  This book took me much longer to read than &quot;Nappily Ever After&quot; as well as &quot;Roadrunner&quot; which were both excellent books.  I do have to say that I enjoyed the ending of the book.  There was no other way to go except wrap it up in a neat little package, the author owed us that.  I hope Ms. Thomas has laid Venus Johnston to rest and comes back as strong as I know she can with another novel because this just didn't do it for me.	2004-03-09

I loved A Dollar And A Dream for many of the same reasons of the other Amazon reviewers.  Each story was good and every author did the Lotto dream justice.  Winning the lottery can change people for the better or for the worse.  Not much more to say about this book except it's a fun read and worth the money you could be spending on a lottery ticket. :-)	2004-02-24

I just finished reading The Dying Ground and have to say that the writing by this author is superb.  In my opinion, the story is an urban mystery set in modern times  The author has carefully shaped her main character, Maceo Redfield, in a way that helps you understand why he reacts the way he does in certain situations.  I'm not going to give the summary of the book, you can read that on your own time.  I will tell you that Maceo is a man who loves hard.  That hard love lands him in trouble but he's willing to take that risk.  Maceo's extended family, friends, and Oakland, California provide a good backdrop to understanding some of his shortcomings.  There's history interwoven throughout without it feeling like you're reading a textbook.  There are characters that you'll love and those that you would never want to come across in real life.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone who has ever loved or anyone who has ever lost.  If you don't fall in either category, read the book anyway, you'll be pleasantly surprised.	2004-01-15

For those few who didn't like it, you're entitled to your opinion but in MY opinion La Jill Hunt accomplished what many great authors before her have managed to do which is make you identify with the characters and leave you wanting more. When you read this book it'll make you want friends like Roni, Tia, Yvonne, and Terrell.  If you already have these types of friends this book makes you appreciate them even more.  The main character, Kayla, is not only beautiful but intelligent with a good support system of friends and family.  Kayla has flaws like we all do so at times she makes decisions that aren't always right but you will never stop rooting for her.  I loved this book and can't wait for the sequel and any other books from Ms. Hunt.	2003-12-28

It captures you in the first chapter where Esther &quot;asks&quot; her teenage daughter, Arnell to prostitute herself so that she can pay rent. Arnell reluctantly goes along with her mother's wishes.<br />Well Esther couldn't stop there.  She reinvents herself as &quot;Queen Esther&quot; and goes so far as to open a brothel called The Honey Well where she browbeats Arnell into continuing a life of prostitution.<br />You will not want to put this book down only for the fact that you can't wait to see what Queen Esther will do or say next.  You think that she can't shock you anymore than she has on the very first page but she will take you on a ride until the very end.  She is the ultimate, conniving Queen Bee that puts the &quot;D&quot; in dysfunctional.  You'll hate her more and more especially when she reveals a surprise about how she can &quot;really put it down&quot; with a certain minister and another party that I won't name.  You have to read this book to find out.<br />Enjoy rooting for Arnell to escape the family business and see what she has to do in order to reclaim herself.  Excellent book, I would highly recommend.	2003-11-15

This is an honest, heartwarming sequel to &quot;God Don't Like Ugly&quot;.  Annette has come into her own and though there are times where her self esteem is lagging she picks herself up and comes out like the star that she is.  Her supporting casts of characters are still funny, saying and doing things that you can relate to with people in your life.  If you like Mary Monroe's colorful characters, I would strongly recommend you read &quot;The Upper Room&quot; and &quot;Gonna Lay Down My Burdens&quot;.  I can't wait for her next book.	2003-11-15

This book does not disappoint.  It keeps your attention from beginning to end, you won't want to put it down.  Great Christmas novel about the three &quot;McBroom Sisters&quot;, decorated with just the right amount of drama, Los Angeles as the backdrop.  The chapters move at a steady flow, the women speak to you as if you know them.  I don't know how Dickey captures the entire being of a women so well in his novels but read his acknowledgments at the end and you may or may not find the answer :-).  Bottom line, buy this book for you, your momma, and your girlfriend.  Consider it a pre-Christmas, pre-Kwanzaa, pre-Hannukah, pre-whatever you want to call it type of gift.  It's well worth the money.	2003-11-05

Although I am familiar with RM Johnson, Dating Games is the first novel I've read from his collection and now I know it was a good novel to start my collection.  I loved this book!!  It had drama, comedy, suspense, and most importantly a good storyline.  It's the type of book that you don't want to end but you also can't wait to see what happens next.  I won't go over the synopsis again but I will tell you that it's even better than what is described on the book jacket.  The author was able to tie all of the characters in to one central theme--trying to make it!!  Throw the &quot;dating games&quot; in this mix and you have a great book.  I think each of these characters wanted to do better in life, they just all had different ways of trying to get there.  I like that each character has faults because then you identify with them even more since we all know no one is perfect.  Even Hennessey wasn't as perfect as everyone around her made her out to be.  You'll find yourself rooting for Alize because you know she's smart but she feels she has nothing more to offer than being cute in the face and thin in the waist.  She puts the meaning in &quot;never trust a big butt and a smile&quot;.  Bottom line, buy this book, you'll be happy you did.	2003-10-01

The summary states that both Morgan and Dakota would partner up with Blake, when in actuality it was only Morgan.  That slip up doesn't even matter because this book was not about revenge but a who's who in the fashion world.  You can read Vogue and get a better story than this.  The plot was weak and unbelievable.  How could these two characters with corporate positions in New York fall for a hustler like Blake.  What kind of business would you open with someone who always snuck to the bathroom when it was time to pay the restaurant bill?  I can't believe these supposedly intelligent characters would fall for this scam and for these two authors to try and make readers believe it is just wrong.  The authors had so much room for character and plot development but wasted it on telling us exactly what shoes were being worn.  The revenge took place in two chapters at the end of the book.  This book had the nerve to serve up an epilogue with a twist.  I had to laugh because it was so ridiculous.  If it took two authors to write this, I would hate to see what one would come up with on her own.  Bottom line--save your money and borrow this book from a friend or the library.	2003-09-28

I don't even know where to begin on stating how poorly this book was written.  If there was anything lower than 1 star this book would receive it.  From the first few pages I knew that I was going to be very disappointed with my purchase.  The opening plot is ridiculous and not even remotely believable.  I don't know if there was any editing done for this book because there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors.  *NOTE TO AUTHOR* Readers get extremely frustrated if they have to continuously overlook spelling and grammatical errors.  It's also frustrating when you're always having to figure out which character is speaking.  I haven't read a book this bad in a long time.  My suggestion to the author is to go back to the drawing board and learn something about character development.  Have a few people read your work before you publish it and get their honest opinion.  I applaud the author's entrepreneurship as a self-publisher but I hope he improves his elementary writing style.  For people even remotely interested in this book I'm warning you to keep your money in your pocket.	2003-08-08
