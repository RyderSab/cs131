The last two books rambled greatly and were much in need of stronger editing, but this book both becomes darker while still being much more enjoyable to read than the last. While many praised Rowling for making Harry less \\"perfect\\" in Phoenix, what it left us with was a long book with someone who was in a foul mood through most of the book...and constantly in unpleasant circumstances as well.  It made for a book that was not very fun to read as a result (the length didn't help) and had an ending that was quite anti-climatic and didn't really tell us anything we hadn't already figured out (death of a major character notwithstanding). Azkaban was, and still is, the best book, and stands on its own as well. Book 6 is not far behind though. It manages to be even darker and more disturbing than the rest of the series in many ways, yet I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of reading it. I forgot how much I really did like the character of Dumbledore...absent through most of Phoenix. He plays a very active role in this book, with good effect. He is our teacher as well as Harry's and it's handled well so that younger readers can follow it without overly boring adults. There's a lot of interesting character developments, not just for Harry, but for other major characters we thought we knew by now. And the ending is truly emotional for any true fan of the series, one that will stay with you awhile, and sets up for the last book in such a way that fans will debate endlessly what is coming until it is released. This book may not stand on its own as well as some of the earlier books...but as one that gives us a compelling story and leaves us dying for more, it more than meets the mark.	2005-07-22

Sadly, it is not nearly as good. The sound effects are painful to listen to at times, pronounciation is hard to follow and often incorrect, and the voice of the characters can sometimes be hard to follow. Gandalf for instance does not at all sound like I would expect him to! The way Bilbo interjects comments during parts of the narration seems a bit odd as well, but I did think the actor did a nice job with him at least. I think someone not familiar with the book would have a very hard time following the story, but for Tolkien fans, it's harmless fun at least.	2005-05-25

It's been interesting to skim through some of the other reviews on this site, it helps me to clarify my own feelings about this book. There were a lot of things I liked about it, some things I didn't, but overall it was a good read and one I recommend.<br />There's no doubt that the Harry in this book is not a very pleasant guy. He's sullen, angry and at times mean to his friends. I do think it may have been a little over the top and hammered home too much in fact. Yet I felt he grew some in maturity through the book, particularly in his teaching the other kids in the club and standing up to tell his story about Voldemort returning. He does more \\"real\\" in some ways, that he has failings and is not always the nicest person around. I think a lot of us can relate to being in a somewhat foul mood at times.<br />The book is definitely long and probably could have done with some more editing. However, I didn't find it quite as tedious as Book 4, which I felt suffered from this more. This one seemed to keep the action and events moving a bit more, and there was a lot of interesting stuff going on, plenty of new characters and new situations. I would still rank Book 3 as the best of the series though.<br />I have mixed feelings about the killing of a main character. It did seem somewhat unnecessary to me, and didn't really serve much purpose. And I almost didn't realize at first that the person had even died, it could have been better written. But I think it increases the suspense to know that everyone is in danger...particularly in a children's series you never really worry about the main characters, you know they will be fine. Rowling keeps us guessing, that's for sure!<br />Overall, it's a great book and does not let faithful readers of the series down. Many authors would tend to get lazy and not rise to as high standards when they know people will buy their books no matter what. I'm pleased that Rowling is still obviously hard at work to be sure that we enjoy ourselves and come out satisfied.ves and come out satisfied.	2003-07-09

[[VIDEOID:28575051]]I'm a huge fan of Tomoko and not only have all her English box books, but most of her ones in Japanese as well! This book actually contains a lot of my long-time favorite models from some of her Japanese books, but it's really nice to have them in English now, for those little points I missed before. Most of the models are not too hard to fold, but are really beautiful looking. Unlike some other boxes, most of these are also not too bad to fit the pieces together on. I like folding ones like the octagonal boxes from decorative chiyogami and/or washi paper...people can't believe that they are actually hand-folded, they look so beautiful! With scrapbooking becoming so popular, you can often find really nice papers that can be cut down to make boxes with as well. This book has a wide variety of the octagonal (8-sided) models that I love so much, but also includes a wide variety of other boxes, from triangular, square, hexagonal (6 sides) and even some heptagonal (7-sided) boxes. A must-have book for anyone interested in origami boxes.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these are not meant for total origami beginners. You should be experienced with basic folding before trying these. With boxes, it is essential to be very accurate in your folds or when you go to lock the pieces together you won't get great results. Start with regular origami paper before working up to more decorative washi papers for truly lovely boxes (check your local craft store or internet origami paper sources).	2002-07-24

This book is a big disappointment when you a big fan of the series and have waited so long for it to come. Don't get me wrong, if you ARE a fan, I would still buy it. If you can wait for paperback though, you won't feel like you wasted so much money though.<br />The repetition is bad, yes. But more, I was frustrated how things we have been anticipating and waiting for never happened, or were just so different than we had been led to expect. For instance, all the times we've been told how the Zelandonii hate the Clan and when the time of confrontation comes, there's nothing to it!! I felt so cheated.<br />I don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say that this story leaves too much undone. I suppose this is a lead-in for book 6, but it should have been more self-contained. I kept waiting for issues to be resolved, and they just fizzled out at the end.<br />I wouldn't say this is the worst book I have read, but it certainly is not what I've come to expect from Ms. Auel.	2002-07-13

I've been a huge fan of the Earth's Children series ever since it first came out. I can't remember when I've been so excited as when I heard book 5 was finally here! I bought the first copy I could get and read like crazy, just like I did with the other books.<br />Sadly, this book came as quite a disappointment. As others have mentioned, there is so little that is new, and scenes we had hoped for never happened (or were over so fast you wondered if these were the same people that have been talked about all along). Over and over again we get the same stuff that's been in previous books, and a buildup to moments that never happen (I expect they will come in Book 6).<br />If you have been a fan of the series, certainly you still have to get this book and read it. I wouldn't have cared what anyone said, I would still buy it and read it, just as I will when the next Harry Potter book comes out. But if you are new to the series, don't start here. And if you have read previous books and weren't all that thrilled with them, this is definitely one to skip.	2002-06-20

I would rate it as my favorite of all of his, and that's saying a lot. In addition to the models mentioned by others, this book has the two bases in it, which I found particularly fun to play with on my own.

Most of the animals I've learned to fold are relatively simple, although they have the advantage of being able to be folded from memory, great for (as someone else mentioned) leaving tips. These models are considerably more difficult than that as a rule, but what fun to be able to fold such a variety of animals! This book is definitely best meant for someone with experience with origami folding, particularly if you are familiar with John's diagramming, as there are some places where you can get a little lost. But overall, a very delightful and enjoyable book.	2000-12-26

I love her work so much I bought a lot of her Japanese books and would just work them out from the diagrams. This book has a lot of my favorite boxes, most are what I would consider Intermediate to Advanced to fold.

Well, maybe, but you should get this book and try it anyway. I like making it with metallic paper...a bit harder to fold that way, but the end result is great! Most of the other models aren't nearly as hard, but still not for beginners. Like all of John's books, they work their way up from a few very easy ones, to the much harder ones at the end. As always John's diagrams are very well done, sharp and easy to read and usually not too difficult to get from step-to-step. His skill at diagramming his models is one reason his books always rate so well. I did find a few minor mistakes but nothing that should trip you up too much if you have folded other advanced models before. I'm not a dinosaur expert by any means, but I did also like the range of types of dinosaurs he included, and of course you'll find most of the really \\"popular\\" ones like Tyrannosaur and Triceratops. This is definitely a books that will appeal equally as well to dinosaur fans as well as origami enthusiasts.	2000-09-21

His newer books certainly have cleaner, crisper diagrams, but this book has a lot of my favorite models, and is still well worth the cost.

An excellent collaboration between two top US folders, Montroll and Lang, this books starts with some easy models and quickly progresses up to some really tough stuff. My own favorite is the horseshoe crab, the finished product is wonderfully true-to-life on both the top and the underside of the crab. Definitely models in here that you will love to show off after several hours of careful folding.	2000-09-21

I've read the first 4 Harry Potter books at this point, and while this one would not be ranked as my favorite, it still is well worth 5 stars. Certainly you need to read this before continuing on to books 3 and 4! But this book did not have quite the novelty of the first book, the wonderful characters of the third, or the great plot developments of the fourth. It just sort of falls between all of them on these counts, giving us an interesting plot, further development of the main characters and a few things we will see again in later books. But the book is still certainly engrossing and a fun read, and highly recommended.	2000-09-21

This book deserves 5 stars just for the praying mantis...probably my favorite model I ever folded. So completely true to life, it's scary. My dad was never very impressed with my origami, but many years ago when he saw that mantis I folded sitting out on the table, he swiped it to take into work to show off. So I folded another one just for him, which he still has to this day. My only complaint is that this model does not use square paper, but a little measuring and cutting is well worth it for the finished result.<br /><br />There are plenty of other good models in here, the crab, the eagle, etc. There are some intermediate models to get you started on (dolphin, penguin, swan), but this is definitely a book for an experienced folder and will take some practice and patience to get through the harder models. The mantis is not the only model with non-square paper, and I find that Lang does have a tendency to be fairly sparse on his diagramming in comparison to someone like Montroll who really doesn't skimp on helping you through the intermediate steps. This does make these models a bit more challenging than they would be if more thoroughly diagrammed, so if you are a fairly new origamist, I would recommend starting with some of John's books before moving up to this one. Even with my experience, some models like the butterfly continue to frustrate me due to some steps that I always seem to get stuck on.	2000-09-21

Without trying to give too much  away, I'll just say that I preferred the book's ending to the Hollywood  movie ending. While it might not be real plausible that such a thing could  happen, it does have a bit more &quot;real-life&quot; feel to it than some  of King's more supernatural stores. There's really nothing in this book  that *couldn't* happen, and that gives it a very real, and scary, feel.  Definitely worth reading.	2000-08-23

It has one of the most memorable characters, John Smith, and one of the  most intriguing plots.<br />From Johnny's childhood skating accident through  the end of the book, we are completely hooked by this character and what is  happening to him. If you liked The Dark Half, you will certainly like the  Dead Zone. Both feature essentially good people that we find ourselves  really liking, but that become the central focus of the evil as well,  thrown into situations that they have no control over.<br />But one thing  that makes the Dead Zone so compelling is the central question that  comes...would you sacrifice your own life to save the rest of the world?  Johnny's torment is very real because it is so very human. No one can  easily walk into the fire, and we'd all like to think that when push comes  to shove, we would make the right decision. I loved the fact, though, that  even the way things are resolved sort of takes you by surprise. No easy  answers or simple solutions in the end, Johnny is above all just an average  man who tried his best to do right.<br />Everything in this book is done just  right, from John's relationships with other people, his reactions to his  *power*, the development of the essential conflict, the final courtroom  transcript to tie up loose ends. Wonderfully written, this will always have  a spot on my bookshelf.	2000-08-23

I had several problems with what was written in the book, but I still enjoyed reading it. The basis of his argument makes us take on faith that his theory and methodology are accurate. I felt that more lead-in was  necessary, to set the stage for how he will find the answers he wants in  the note. Instead, he jumps right in, and we are expected to blindly  follow. As a result, I never did really trust that what he was deducing was  indeed correct, although certain areas I felt truly did at least support  the theory that Patsy did it.<br />So, 3 stars for an intersting and  thought-provoking read. More stars if he had been able to really convince  me it all made sense.	2000-06-14

Both  I felt stayed very in character for the most part, and it was clear the  audience was greatly enjoying the performance. It was considerably shorter  than most audio books, only an hour in length. However, that's really the  only thing that detracts from it, and made me drop it down to 4 stars.

These books are just wonderful, every one of them kept me engrossed and surprised right up to the end. Just when I thought I had it figured out, the story would take a turn and I'd be wondering what would happen next again. Beautifully written, and great,  complex characters!<br />As for some of the criticisms, well, makes you  wonder if the same people would give 1 star to the Hobbit, Narnia, and the  Wizard of Oz books, classics that include quite a bit of magic and  wizardry. All of these books have death in them as well, sometimes featured  quite prominently, but I would certainly consider them great children's  books regardless. Harry Potter is certainly in the same vein as these.<br />As for saying it's unrealistic, HELLO!  It's fantasy!  It's not  *supposed* to be completely realistic. Again, I would consider the Lord of  the Rings one of the great books of our time, but you could say it was  unrealistic too, with all the elves and dwarves and wizards. But that  doesn't mean it doesn't draw you into that other world and make you imagine  what it would be like. The characters become real people to you and that's  what makes it great.	1999-12-23

A lot of it was really implausible...like the fact that, with all the time-traveling we've seen in Trek, they still don't take that into consideration when considering a  captain's tenure!  Sorry, I just don't buy them giving the Ship of the Line  to someone who is out of his time. Many of the other characterizations just  don't work for me, like Picard being so upset by losing the Enterprise. We  saw him at the end of Generations, and he did not look like someone  grieving over-much for the ship.<br />That said, once you get into it, the  book does for the most part hold your attention. It bounces around a bit  much and the various plots are all resolved much too quickly in the end.  Not one of the worst Trek novels by any means, but not one I'm likely to  read again.	1999-12-16

This is one of the few books I really had to strain to finish, as it was so unpleasant to read. Not sure why I did bother to finish it, other than just determination to not leave a book unread, but the ending certainly didn't leave me feeling any more satisfied than the rest of the book.	1999-11-17

I'm never a big fan of stories that do this, try to  pull in characters and situations we've already seen, other than the  essentials (I guess it's supposed to make the author look clever)...but  this series did it so much I wanted to scream. In fact, I can't think of  single character or plot device that was completely original and din't have  SOME reference to something else in the Trek universe.<br />Having said that,  there were things to like about the books, so I give it 2 stars...not  totally awful, but not sure it'd be worth reading when you have other  choices.	1999-11-17

I was so engrossed in the book, I didn't want to go to the beach or anywhere else until I was done! Thankfully, it was a short book...  When I got home, I went on a search to find my own copy. When I loaned it  to a friend in college, I never got it back from her. Over the years, I  bought this book whenever I saw it in the store, as I would keep loaning my  copy to people and never getting it back! With online bookstores,  thankfully it's a lot easer to get my replacement copies!<br />I wrote to the  Oprah Winfrey show, I think she would LOVE this book, and it would be great  to see it get the kind of exposure being her Book Club pick would bring, so  if you love it, write to them too! The thing that amazes me about One  Child, is how few people have ever read it, I don't think anyone I've  mentioned it to has ever read it, until I give them my copy. And of course,  everyone loves the book!<br />P.S. Be sure to read the Tiger's Child, not  quite as emotionally powerful as One Child, but a great book on how  heartbreaking reality can be sometimes.	1999-05-21

Only problem with the books is knowing there aren't going to be more of them. That's right, But the books themselves are really great, make me wish I had a better TV and VCR, though, as some are really hard to  catch. I am more into the plot problems, I got a kick out of Phil's story  of what really got him into nitpicking, as it was something that drove me  nuts too!	1999-05-12

I picked up this book at an airport to kill time and was glad I did! Don't have as much time to read as a used to, and a lot of the Trek books I had read were not terribly well written, and the plots kinda all the same. This  one is most definitely not in either of those categories. The story is  great, and the writing excellent. Way to go Michael!!	1999-05-12

Lots of good  photos, and information on the obstacles, the various organizations, etc.  Good information on preparing to go to your first show. Not much here for  the experienced competitor.	1998-08-28

I love Rien's work...he is best known for the Gnome books, but I much prefer his books on real-life creatures. This book on dogs is a great example of the work a wonderfully talented artist and story-teller. I've never seen it in any other bookstore, and was thrilled to find it here at Amazon.com. What I got in the mail was even more than I had hoped, truly a wonderful book to treasure for years. The lovely oil paintings would be enough to charm most people, but Rien's little comments and stories throughout all his books are what really make them special	1997-03-10
