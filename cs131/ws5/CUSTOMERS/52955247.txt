US	52955247	R32AB2YECHFHT0	0375703861	363806782	White Teeth: A Novel	Books	1	14	20	N	N	White Teeth more aptly titled ï¿½Root Canalï¿½	This novel has been in my to be read pile for several months and I was anxious to get to it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews by critiques.  Wonderful, Astonishing, Funny as hell, the jacket promises.  I failed to see the humor anywhere.  What I found were angry ramblings in regard to characters that I dont think even the author particularly liked.  Ms. Smith touched on animal rights, radical organizations, love, friendship, war, marriage, religion, science, class and culture with such a brutal tone that I became more and more depressed with the turn of each page.  There was no focus of the 400+ pages which (I believe) led to a rather ridiculous and completely unsatisfactory end.  Im very sorry that I devoted the time I did to trudge through this great disappointment.	2001-09-18

Varni clearly has a love of words and language and there are times when this shines, particulary in part one.  But in regard to story structure, the work is lacking.  The characters had my interest initially but it never paid off and by the last 80 pages I was trudging through just simply to say I'd finished.  The main character and narrator, Vincent, struck me as brooding and self-absorbed.  Wanting to transplant himself but continually coming back to his roots simply so he could have a dysfunctional family to blame for his own hum-drum existence.  Nothing new there.  If you value your reading time, take a pass until the author (or his editor) have more experience and/or a story to tell.	2001-05-14
US	52955247	R2QLON8R1F7TFS	0871137658	553666976	In the Fall	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Unhurried literature from a remarkable new author.	Not unlike Cold Mountain (to which In The Fall has been loosely compared) this novel unfolds at an unhurried pace.  Aside from that and the post Civil War setting, I fail to see any real similarities.  In fact, I found  the overall story of In The Fall to be more interesting in regard to varied  characters, settings and actions. If I had to compare to any well known  work I would pick Faulkner's Light In August.  Those that appreciate  literary fiction and aren't in a hurry to get through their &quot;to be  read&quot; pile will probably enjoy this novel very much.	2000-07-30

I found myself not really liking the character of Julia very much and  hence found the love affair aspect a bit overdone.  It took me some time to  get into this book - I've been picking it up and putting it down since  March and only just ended up finishing it last week.  It didn't really grab  me as I thought it might based on reviews.  However, I found the writing  strong and will definately seek out other work of the same author in the  future.	2000-07-08

Aside from a handful of passages, I really didn't find all that much humor in this.  Just a story about a woman getting married and her reflections on her life as it once was and projections on how it will be after marriage -  if in fact she can ever get up the courage to go through with it.  A quick  read and sometimes funny but not hilarious and not terribly insightful  either.	2000-06-24

I get such a kick out of all these &lt;ahem&gt; &quot;serious readers&quot; that are so put out by this book.  Perhaps reading the jacket didn't give you a clue as to what the content might be?  If you bought this  thinking it was literature then you really are clueless and I'm afraid  there may be little hope for you.  This book is silly and yes sometimes  it's even stupid...but it's mostly just fun.  It's not prose - just  something light and quick (AKA &quot;a beach read&quot;).  I'm satisfied  that I got what I paid for - a couple of hours of light entertainment.  Not  to like it because you felt it failed as literary fiction is, in itself,  ridiculous. Lighten up already!	2000-02-26

The character of Helen came across as a domineering 40ish woman who had no friends (although everyone was supposedly in love with her for whatever  reason) who hung out with her teenaged employees and obsessed over a  ridiculous letter.  I couldn't care less who wrote the letter or what  happened to Helen so I gave up before wasting more of my time.	2000-02-14

It's not something I would normally have picked up  but I must say I very much enjoyed it.  Garlands writing is straightforward and easy - a pleasure to read, simple to follow.  The story is fantastic. By mid way Garland had the plot built up to the  &quot;edge of your seat&quot; feeling which he maintained beautifully until  the end. Although I tried throughout to figure out where the plot was going  it ended up much different than what I'd expected.  It's a page turner.  I  agree with many of the other readers in that Leonardo may not cut it as the  main character in the film version.	2000-02-12

I read this 3 or 4 years ago and at the time I thought that I didn't really care for it -- the negative tone and VERY dramatic end.  The funny thing is that years later this is one novel that I can remember quite  clearly.  It really makes you *feel* something and maybe that's what good  literature is supposed to do.	2000-01-27

US	52955247	RR7PYOBLC5WFH	1565122968	780904511	Gap Creek : The Story of a Marriage	Books	3	16	17	N	N	A fast read, interesting but far from &quot;a masterpiece&quot;	Narrated by the main character Julie, the story shows us the first year of a young couples marriage and the difficult situations they find themselves in and how they learn to cope.  Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It was a fast  read and there was always something interesting going on.  It never got  bogged down in sappy insight or rambling prose.  There was no real  resolution though and I found the drastic turn-around of some of the  characters (i.e. Hank and Ma Richards) to seem somewhat rushed and a bit  too &quot;neat&quot;. Robert Morgan did a pretty good job of getting inside  a womans head to tell this tale.  However, the romantic situations (the  first kiss and marriage bed scenes), in my opinion, did nothing for the  story.  I found it unbelievable that two very young people could be that  uninhibited or sure of themselves.  I highly doubt that this 17 year old  virgin would be given to psychedelic visions.	2000-01-23

I couldn't help caring about each and every one of them.  Although the story is warm, heartfelt and interesting in regard to small town life its not necessarily  profound. If your seeking entertainment without feeling you've wasted your  time when the final page is turned, Plainsong will deliver.	2000-01-10

But the novel read like one great long trail of gossip that I heard but didn't really care about.  At mid-point it seemed like it should end and I still had 200  pages to go!  It went further downhill from there with some really sappy  and/or silly scenes that bordered on being pathetic. It was MUCH longer  than it needed to be and I'm surprised that it made by any self-respecting  editor.  I'm very, very sorry I wasted several hours on this novel when  there is much more enjoyable material out there.  (Would recommend  Plainsong by Kent Haruf as a far superior read. Not much by way of humor  but a wonderful and moving story of small town characters.)	2000-01-10

While Angela's Ashes was a gripping and heart wrenching read, 'Tis simply managed to tie up some loose ends. After the experience of Angela's Ashes and learning so much about Frank's life, it's impossible to imagine not  reading this book.  However, one shouldn't expect the same level of  intensity.	1999-10-01

The beginning hinted of mystery and romance, the middle took the various aspects off on their own dead-end paths, the end just  became a silly summation of misunderstandings and pathetic introspection.   It was, however, ironic that the center of the plot was an American author  writing insipid novels for masses of inept readers. I feel like I've been  had in buying this book.  If you must subject yourself - borrow it from the  library.	1999-10-01

After reading more serious works this summer I was in the mood for something light and fast.  TGGTHF was the answer - finished it in under 24 hours and turned the last page feeling good and upbeat.

Although Benjamin's &quot;gift&quot; was central, the reader finds that all of the characters seem to have a special gift.  It's how these gifts are used that ultimately has a great influence on events in each of our  lives.  The author does not preach, instead he weaves an interesting tale  that can be enjoyed for face value or the reader can look further and see a  more complex meaning.  A very enjoyable book, highly recommended.	1999-05-19

Mid-way, she filled many pages and I became bored with her situation.  By the end, I decided that if she had been omitted entirely,  she wouldn't have been missed.  On the other hand, Aunt Mattie and Uncle  Tom had the potential to be very strong characters, not only in the lives  of Darlene and the children but most especially for Earl, for whom I felt  some sympathy.  He struck me as being mean and cold simply for the sake of  not knowing any better.  Mattie came on the scene too late, and in my  opinion, dumped a lot of revelations and insight into the story that (at  that point) was already complex.  She was distracting when I wanted to  focus on the other characters - I found myself wondering &quot;where have  you been?  why now?&quot;.  Overall, I really liked this novel and look  forward to future work by this author.  Highly recommended.	1999-05-06

It's rare that I read a book that I didn't grow to appreciate in some way by the time I finish.  The only thing I appreciated about this was finally closing it.  This novel doesn't &quot;flow&quot;, it's difficult to follow  from the start.  The characters aren't developed well, I found myself not  really caring about them.  I wish I had listened to the bookseller when she  struggled to find something positive on this one.<BR> I'd suggest Mercy  Road, Dalia Pagani or Amy &amp; Isabelle, Elizabeth Strout, both strong new  writers, as more enjoyable.	1999-05-05

Although I enjoyed the overall story, I found the author to be a bit too detailed in some of the settings. Just made for slow going at times.  There were some issues which left me feeling unsettled. I felt that either the  climax was understated or simply left hanging. If you enjoy this novel, you  would probably enjoy the quirky writing of E. Annie Proulx in The Shipping  News and Post Cards.	1999-03-05
