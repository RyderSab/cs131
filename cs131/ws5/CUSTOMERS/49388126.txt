Lullaby Town is no exception, but it's hampered by flaws that aren't seen in Crais's earlier books. <br /> <br />The main flaw here is pacing.  Cole is hired to find the ex-wife and child of a famous Hollywood director.  The trail leads him to a sleepy little town out in the middle fo nowhere, in which Cole spends a fair amount of time doing basically nothing and feeling pretty bored.  This boredom seeps from the pages and infects the reader as well; the first half of the book is so slow and laborious that I found myself skimming large portions, something that I normally never do.  Cole is such a likeable character and his sense of humor is so endearing that I managed to struggle through those first 150 pages or so, and the pace in the second half of the book was definitely faster even if the plotline was as predictable as snow in the wintertime. <br /> <br />The bottom line?  Read it if you're a Robert Crais fan and you're going through the whole Elvis Cole series in order, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off.	2005-10-04

His main character is both tough and quirky, the stereotypical wisecracking PI who knows how to use his fists as well as his rapier-sharp wit.  It seems like a formula that should be successful every time out. <br /> <br />Stalking the Angel, the second book in the series, is not, however, the best.  The jokes and puns that seemed fresh and witty in the first novel, The Monkey's Raincoat, now read like they were taken out of a huge volume titled \\"101 Jokes for Public Speakers.\\"  In plain terms, much of the humor is simply lame.  The plot also seems like something that was hastily thrown together after an evening of watching kung fu movies on television; an ancient Japanese manuscript is stolen by the asian mafia and Elvis Cole is hired to get it back.  It's a premise that's just too hackneyed to get very excited about. <br /> <br />What does earn the book three stars, however, is the set of characters who remain likeable even when the book fails in other areas.  Stalking the Angel is also a fast read, so once you've breezed through the 260 pages you'll feel a bit excited but not overwhelmed.  An entertaining if not fantastic read, this book is essential for those reading the Elvis Cole series in order.	2005-09-21

With Persuader, however, Child has worked out most of his kinks and produced a fast-paced, engrossing thriller. <br /> <br />The main character Reacher is more of an Arnold Schwarzanegger type than a private detective.  He's big, he's brawny, and he typically kills dozens of bad guys in every novel without breaking a sweat.  Imagine a bigger, badder James Bond with no sense of humor and you've basically got Reacher.  I was pleased that in this book, though, Reacher faces a bad guy even bigger and tougher than he is.   <br /> <br />10 years ago Reacher thought he had killed a man who committed a horric crime.  Now he finds that man very much alive and apparently embroiled in a multi-faceted drug smuggling ring.  Along with a rogue group of government agents, Reacher infiltrates the ring to bring both it and his old enemy crashing down. <br /> <br />With a plot that races along at breakneck speed, plenty of action and a cast of well-rounded characters, Persuader is a thriller that'll keep you reading at a frantci pace right up to the final page.	2005-09-20

That doesn't neccessarily mean, however, that he knows a lot about writing. <br /> <br />Like a lot of people who are experts in a certain field and who feel they're qualified to write novels because of it, Swain's first novel GRIFT SENSE suffers from a lot of amateur flaws.  His characters are mostly stereotypes, with the exception of the main character, a 62-year-old widower, who offers a somewhat fresh appeal as being a little older and crustier than the typical hard-boiled detective.  The rest of the characters, though, have been seen a million times in other books.  Swain's dialogue is flat and uninteresting and his depictions of mobsters, bikers, gamblers and con men add nothing new to the genre.  One bizarre quality they all share is that even though the book was written in 1999 and is set in present-day Las Vegas, the characters seem to have been lifted from old black and white mobster films of the 40s.  You expect someone in a zoot suit to walk in and say something like \\"Freeze, you big galoot, before I plug you fulla lead!\\" <br /> <br />One good aspect of the book is that the plot is not terribly predictable and the pace is fast and fluid.  The big scam that our hero is called in to investigate, though, is one of those impossible-to-believe scenarios that you would chuckle at if you saw it in a movie.  Still, though, for an amateur, Swain has at least written a book that provides a few solid hours of light-hearted entertainment if nothing else.	2005-08-03

This time, however, I can honestly say that No Second Chance was a good, decent book despite its flaws. <br /> <br />Coben is great at setting up a story and drawing the reader in with a slam-bang beginning.  Other books I've read by him have fallen apart after the first 50 pages or so, but this one kept the pace relatively fast and the tension relatively high throughout the entire book.  There are, unfortunately, still a few times when Coben goes off on a tangent and spends pages and pages giving meaningless detail---for instance, at one point while describing a kids soccer game, instead of just saying \\"they ate snacks afterward,\\" he gives the exact brand names and flavors of every snack the kids are eating.  The description goes on for about half a page and the reader is practically left in a coma by the time Coben is finished. <br /> <br />Otherwise the book is fairly good, although many readers have had problems with the ending.  Coben always makes the mistake of trying to get too cute at the end of his books, having one surprise ending after another until the reader is relatively unsure what the heck is going on.  In No Second Chance the ending was equally muddled and fairly impossible to believe, yet I would still consider it to be the most believable ending of any of his books to this point.	2005-07-15

The only thing is, this genre isn't as easy as it looks.  It's not the literary equivalent of a fast-food hamburger that any old would-be cook can throw together.  The writers who are best at it use subtle ingredients and years of experience to come up with the perfect recipe for a hard-boiled thriller. <br /> <br />My main problem with Hard Freeze is that it just drips with stereotypes.  There is the detective himself, an ex-con with an attitude.  There is the sexy secretary.  There is the meeting in a jazz club with a client.  There are the Italian gangsters and the creepy, scary hit-man.  One ingredient that just didn't seem to belong was the Hannibal Lecter-ish serial killer who apparently wandered over from another genre of books also filled with stereotypes.  Basically everything in this book was well-worn and so cliched that I felt like I had read this book a dozen times before.  The dialogue was not especially catchy---too many of the main character's tough-guy lines sounded like they had been recycled from Schwarzanegger movies of the 1980s.  None of the characters were fleshed-out enough to be truly interesting.  Even the main character, who seems to appeal to so many other readers, was a shapeless, faceless non-entity without much personality or flavor. <br /> <br />Other than a few four-letters words and one or two very violent scenes, I honestly wouldn't even refer to this book as \\"hard-boiled.\\"  Compared to your average book by Andrew Vachss, Hard Freeze seemed about as tough and threatening as a Nancy Drew mystery.  All in all I would have to say that it made a fairly enjoyable vacation read, but I won't be picking up the rest of the books in the series.	2005-06-30

Coben does have talent; his dialogue is sometimes witty, his plots start out as interesting, and he can create a sense of tension that pulls the reader in right at the beginning of the book.  Unfortunately, though, it seems that Coben typically runs out of steam after the first 40 or 50 pages of each book because after the initial set-up, his novels typically fall flat on their faces. <br /> <br />Just One Look has a lot of the flaws that Coben's other books share; the characters are all stereotypes, the plotline seems soap opera-ish, and there's just too much going on that has nothing to do with the main story line.  The plot itself just isn't very interesting; something happened at a rock concert a long time ago and a bunch of people got killed.  It seems like something you'd find in a young adult book aimed at teenagers, not an adult novel.  Tied-in with this plot is the fact that a woman who was injured at the concert but survived now has to deal with the fact that her husband has disappeared.  Once again, it just doesn't grab us. <br /> <br />Coben goes on for nearly 400 pages with long description of mundane topics such as breakfast cereal and video games.  Action is going on as well, but it seems to have nothing to do with the main plot.  Then, in the final 30 pages or so, Coben dumps about a dozen \\"surprises\\" on his readers which supposedly explain the whole book but in reality simply make the story far, far too complicated and extremely unbelievable.  By the time we reach the end of the book, we neither know nor care what actually happened to these characters. <br /> <br />My advice?  Give this book \\"Just One Look\\"---a very quick one---and then move on to something more interesting.	2005-06-17
US	49388126	R3ELZA8F0O3YYY	0446602620	435728437	Blood Work	Books	2	14	19	N	N	Michael Connelly Needs to Mow My Lawn	It's pretty common for me to read a novel by a bestselling author and think, \\"Well, that was okay.  Not great, but okay.\\"  That's what I did when I read two of Michael Connelly's previous books.  I can only classify the man as a competent writer, nothing more.  He does several things in his writing that I find very annoying; such as, for some reason he hates to use contractions in his dialogue, so his characters all end up sounding like robots when they say things like, \\"I will find more evidence.  You will see that I am right, and then you will wish you had not doubted me.\\"    Those common little flaws aside, though, Blood Work was simply a terrible book.  The characters were all cliched stereotypes that we've seen a thousand times.  The dialogue was flat, the excitement level was roughly equal to a turtle marathon, and the entire book just dragged on and on and on, going nowhere.    By far the worst aspect of this book was the pacing.  Oh, lord, the pacing.  In the beginning, we learn that Terry McCaleb is a retired FBI man who recently recieved a heart transplant.  A woman visits him to ask him to investigate the murder of her sister, who was killed in a gas station robbery.  The kicker is that it's the murdered woman's heart that McCaleb got during his transplant.    Now, this is a nice little set-up.  Different, interesting.  But then the book proceeds to go nowhere fast.  By page 100, the only thing we've learned is that the person who killed the woman also killed a man during an ATM robbery.  By page 250, the only new information we have is that when he killed the woman, he also stole her earring.  No major developements happen until around page 350, and by then the reader has most likely sunk into a coma.  Even the ending of the book fails to deliver the goods; the few things that were supposed to be surprises were easy to guess near the beginning.  The one plot point that does take us somewhat by surprise is so neatly and easily wrapped up that we still feel disappointed.    Not only does the book take hundreds of pages to actually go anywhere, but it's bogged down by useless details that Connelly seems to love adding in.  He'll give lengthy descriptions of a man putting on a shirt, or describe the type of Pop Tarts the main character is eating, or the music he hears in an elevator.  He also over-describes simple tasks as if he's talking to pre-schoolers.  He'll say things like, \\"The man smiled when he saw the woman approaching.  A smile is when the ends of your mouth both point upward.  People smile when they are happy.\\"  When I got to a line about a person wearing sunglasses in order to block the sun, I almost fainted from disbelief.  Michael, please.  Get a grip.    I found myself wanting to stop reading this book in the middle many, many times.  I eventually just skimmed through all of the bad soap opera dialogue and the endless (and pointless) descriptions to get to the end, which was as predictable and cliched as I expected.  I found myself thrilled that the book was over but at the same time upset that I had wasted 10 or 12 hours reading it.    To me, the solution is simple.  Michael Connelly needs to come to my house every weekend over the summer and mow my lawn.  This will give me back the time that I lost reading his book, and it's the only fair solution to this problem.  In-between cutting the front and the back yard, I'll give Michael a glass of lemonade and suggest that he switch careers and begin writing math textbooks, which are only slightly more exciting than Blood Work was.      Don't worry, Michael; the yard isn't very big.  Just pick up some gas on the way over because I think I'm almost out.	2005-05-24

Then, everything changed.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a BAD book.  The story of a doctor whose supposedly-dead wife seems to reappear after 8 years by email and in other strange ways was well-written and had some interesting characters, but author Coben tried to get too cute; he packs in so many supposed plot twists (I say supposed because they're all basically different versions of the same twist) that the story gets convoluted and the reader gets to the point where he just doesn't care anymore.  Also, too much of the book was the type of material we've all seen a million times before---characters who are just stereotypes, chase scenes, etc.  I started this book thinking it was going to be one of the best books I had read in years and finished it thinking it was only so-so.  I'd say this one is good for the beach or a long airplane ride; a few good hours of entertainment but nothing that will stick in your mind forever.	2005-05-16

We then have a tried-and-true scary situation; a little girl lost in the woods, with an unseen evil apparently stalking her.  This SHOULD have been utterly terrifying.  It SHOULD have been gripping, suspenseful and impossible to put down.  I SHOULD have found myself unable to sleep after reading it because I was trembling too badly.  The problem was, none of this happened.<br /><br />This is a short book for King (only 260 pages) and it seems like a large chunk of it is missing; mainly, the good part.  For the first 200 pages, King describes the first week that his little girl hero is lost in the woods.  He describes it not only day by day but hour by hour.  Over that time, the girl is a little bit scared, a little bit hungry, a little bit uncomfortable, but never shows the level of dismal fear that any 9-year-old girl would actually be showing at this point; King's hero actually talks and acts more like a sassy 13 or 14-year-old, and her inner thoughts are more like those of a bright college kid!<br /><br />Then, after that first 200 pages, King skips ahead by about 4 or 5 days to a point where the hero is finally REALLY tired, REALLY hungry...although still not really scared.  She never gets scared, so neither do we.  When we finally meet the invisible evil that has been stalking her, the discovery is dull, common, and not only not scary, it's almost silly.  I found myself wanting to rewind this book and write my own version, but better!<br /><br />If King had actually described this lost-in-the-woods experience from the viewpoint of a small child, the book would have been gripping and entertaining even if it wasn't terrifying.  As it was, I felt like I was reading about some high school or college kid who was in a mildly unpleasant situation---nothing to be really concerned about.  This book will make its way back to the used book store in record time, no doubt about it.book store in record time, no doubt about it.	2005-04-20

Unfortunately Murder in Canton, the last book in the Judge Dee series, is a poor way to end the adventures of this Chinese version of Sherlock Holmes. <br /> <br />The mystery itself is somewhat muddled and so uninteresting that I found myself nodding off during parts of the book.  I ended up skimming through several parts of the novel and by the end I couldn't even remember who some of the suspects were!  I have to say that even though the author basically uses the same plots over and over during this series, this particular book just didn't hold my interest. <br /> <br />Another disappointment was the fact that Ma Joong, one of Judge Dee's assistants, was completely absent from this book.  He was always the funniest character in the series and he was sorely missed in this novel. <br /> <br />If you're like me and you enjoy reading a series in its entirety (I've actually read all of the Judge Dee books twice), then you should give Murder in Canton a try; just don't expect to be overwhelemed, because this is by far one of the weakest books in an otherwise good series.	2005-04-04

His writing style is somewhat plain and simple and you'll never be knocked out by his glowing literary descriptions.  What he does manage to do, though, is bring this long-lost era to life with his interesting characters and his cultural and historical know-how while telling an enjoyable tale along the way.  While some of his longer books are bogged down by too many characters and too much detail, The Haunted Monastery is virtually perfect.  Judge Dee and one of his assistants are stuck in a gloomy monastery on a stormy night.  The place is rumored to be haunted, and while the threat of harmful spirits lingers in the background, the judge must solve three seemingly unrelated mysteries which all tie together in the end.

First of all, let me warn you; several people who have written reviews for this book have spoiled the surprise ending in their reviews, an amazingly unpardonable act in my opinion.  Do not read the review by Robert Hazelwood if you intend to read this book and don't want the ending spoiled.<br /><br />Now, on to the book itself.  Shutter Island was as well-written as all the other Dennis Lehane books.  The premise is interesting; a pair of US Marshals are sent to an island which houses a facility for the criminally insane in order to track down one of the escaped prisoners during a hurricane.  The book has witty, well-drawn characters, a gloomy setting, and plenty of ingredients for a real hair-raising thriller.  There are several very creepy scenes and the whole feel of the book is bleak and moody, almost like a haunted house story.  The surprise ending was, I thought, well-done and made the book very unique compared to many other bestsellers.<br /><br />The book did, however, have its flaws.  There are some important people and events who are mentioned early in the book but are very quickly glossed over, then when they appear later on you have no idea who they are because Lehane fails to remind us.  The book also suffered from its pacing; it's a short book by today's standards, only 360 pages, and I felt that it should have either been far longer, with more detailed explanations and more creepy scenes which took advantage of the scary setting of the novel, or it should have been much shorter---this book could easily have been a novella, actually, running no more than about 100 pages.<br /><br />All in all, though, Shutter Island was an enjoyable book which will give you the shivers while you're reading it and haunt you for several days after you're finished.  This would be a perfect book for a plane trip or a day at the beach.	2004-12-23

That being said, I'm sorry to admit that out of the 4 books I've read by him, I've only enjoyed one and it wasn't Sea of Bones.  The book starts out with an unusual hook; the narrator has killed a man and buried the body in the ocean, and he watches with interest as several other characters attempt to find the body.  As the story goes on, however, we find out that these events are part of a previous book involving the same characters and have nothing to do with this book or its plot.  Instead, the plot of Sea of Bones involves a talented con-man who has ripped off several wealthy people for millions of dollars.  The narrator and a small group of his friends plan an elaborate scheme to turn the tables on the con-man and rip him off instead.  While the plot is somewhat interesting if not highly original, we don't get into the meat of the story until roughly 150 pages in.  Instead, we are given lengthy details of dinner parties and other social functions along with pages and pages of clever dialogue and other padding which does nothing to advance the plot and instead bogs the book down so heavily that I found myself falling asleep after reading only 4 or 5 pages.  While the ending of the book was somewhat exciting, slogging through 340 pages of fluff to get there was almost like torture.  For a fast-paced, exciting and literary thriller, read When She Was Bad by the same author, and leave Sea of Bones on the shelf where it belongs.	2004-12-08

This book is virtually flawless; the characters are fascinating, the plot is exciting and original, the dialogue is dead-on, and the writing itself echoes the muscular prose of Hemingway at his finest.  I've read this book three times over the years and loved it every single time.  A gripping Hitchcockian thriller that spans a period of about 20 years, filled with both action and solid emotion.  A winner on all counts.	2004-11-28

I love it so much I would probably buy a copy of the man's grocery list if it were published.  I have to admit, though, that the last few books in the Dave Robicheaux series have been slightly disappointing to me.  It's not that they were bad, they were simply not as extraordinary to me as his first five or six were.  Last Car to Elysian Fields was, to me, his finest book in several years.  The prose simply drips with atmosphere and texture, more like poetry than a novel.  The interwoven plot lines were fresh and interesting, the characters were superbly drawn as usual, and the climax was both touching and believable.  I highly recommend this book to Burke fans and to anyone who enjoys crime novels written with literary flair.	2004-11-12

Since Ferrigno has written several other books that are quite good, it truly does seem like this is one that just got cranked out in a hurry without much thought.  The plot is weak, the characters mostly unlikeable...I found very little to like about this book at all.  In fact, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the villianous character called The Angel was rather amusing.  All in all, I would say avoid this book and buy one of Ferrigno's other novels.  This one is just really, really bad...as my title says, it's only slightly better than terrible.	2004-11-12

Secondly, unlike Hall's Thorn books, Rough Draft just isn't very good.  If you've read most of Hall's books like I have, you're probably beginning to feel like if you've read one, you've read them all.  A fine writer in his early years, Hall has now gotten stale and boring.  The plot for this book was fragmented and patched together, with a twist ending that just didn't work at all for me.  The entire idea for this book seemed like a throwaway, something that Hall came up with at the last minute just to crank another book out.  Reviewers make a big deal out of Hall's villians, and they are pretty interesting, but the female villian in this one is just like every other female villian that Hall creates, and the male villian needed more fleshing out to be truly classic.  The good guys, however, are so plain and vanilla that I never cared one bit about them throughout the entire book.  It was a struggle to get through this one, and I can't recommend it to anyone.  For a good read, try one of Hall's earlier books instead.	2004-10-25
US	49388126	R1ARRSWLLBGC3I	0385333560	519409366	The River Sorrow	Books	1	7	10	N	N	Simply Awful	Craig Holden has done some very good writing in his career, but this book can't be included in that statement.  I loved his book Four Corners of Night so I thought I'd give this one a try, but I put it down after slogging through the first 200 pages.  The plot seemed mildly interesting, but the characters are so one-dimensional and shallow that I didn't care one bit about anything that happened to them.  They were all boring, poorly-created cliches.  The writing in this book was also terrible.  Holden's prose in Four Corners of Night was some of the best I've seen in years, so he's obviously learned a lot about his craft, but this novel reads like a high school kid's attempt at writing a \\"cool\\" book.  Don't waste your time on this one.	2004-10-15

Unfortunately, though, I stopped reading Big Red Tequila after 50 pages and never picked it up again.  Everything about the book is just too, too hackneyed---the plot, the characters, the jokes and one-liners from the wise-cracking main character---they've all been done a million times before.  I felt like I had already read this book just because everything in it was so unoriginal.  There were a few things that made me chuckle, but I just can't invest the time it would take to read 400 pages in something so average and uninspired.  From what I understand, Riordan's knowledge of Texas culture is dead-on and that might be one thing that draws certain readers to this book, but it wasn't enough to keep me reading.  Hopefully the rest of the books in this series are better, but I'm not sure if I'll ever take the time to find out because there are so many other great authors out there.	2004-07-30

It's a style that works on occasion, and this book is one time that I must confess that I did enjoy it. His main character Reacher is a little too Rambo for my liking---a giant who kills every bad guy with a single punch and never even comes close to getting hurt himself. His secondary characters are a little too cliche', and his plots are less than amazing (I've read 2 of his books and both times the plot has been something that's been done a million times). Still, though, his books make for an enjoyable read-it-and-then-forget-about-it diversion, like eating a whole bag of potato chips while watching reruns on TV. Short on substance but long on action, and Mr. Child always seems to have a good working knowledge of his subject matter. I would have given three stars but some extra-bad bad guys and good suspense scenes bumped this review up to 4.	2004-07-24

This guy is so talented, so funny, and so adept at capturing the raw feel of average daily life for a simple bartender who occasionally plays private detective.  I found myself in awe of the writing in this book; so original, so humorous...with characters so real that you can't help rooting for them.  Pelecanos has now gone on to write books which are far more serious and not nearly as good, in my opinion.  His first three books, featuring PI Nick Stefanos, are really fantastic and to me, this is the best of the three.  A far cry from the usual tale of the down-and-out PI who drinks too much and cries in his beer all day.  This book is truly original, a real gem, and fans of PI fiction (and blue-collar literature) will love it.	2004-06-26
US	49388126	R9HOKJNV3OU2G	0451208765	524201117	Sleep No More	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Good Supernatural Thriller!	To enjoy this book, you first need to know what you're reading.  Unlike the other books by Greg Iles, this is a supernatural thriller in the vein of Dean Koontz or perhaps the less monster-filled books of Stephen King.  The plot isn't overtly original; a man's dead ex-girlfriend has come back to &quot;haunt&quot; him by possessing other people's bodies, causing all sorts of problems, as you can imagine.  But Iles has taken a rather contrived plot and made it very readable, keeping the suspense level high and the action at a nearly non-stop pace.  I found myself unable to put this book down, and that rarely happens with me these days.  I read the entire book in two days and was sad when it ended.  My wife reacted the same way, and she and I both read voraciously and go through half a dozen books every month while rarely finding one that grabs us like Sleep No More did.<br />I'll repeat, this wouldn't qualify as great literature.  It's escapist fiction, but it's damn good for what it is.  Take it on a plane, read it on the beach, use it to kill a few hours and you won't be disappointed.	2004-06-25

It's a story of two cops, both flawed in their own different ways, tracking down a missing child.  The twist is that one of the cops had his own child disappear years earlier.  The characters in this book are so human, so real, so utterly believable...and the prose is just a dream.  Holden writes like a poet, with supreme skill and depth.  If you enjoy the literary suspense thrillers of folks like James Lee Burke and the better works of Dennis Lehane and George Pelecanos, you'll get a kick out of this one.  It's got action, it's got heart, and it's a just a damn good read.	2004-06-25
US	49388126	RJIZ4CGMCUIO8	0399147357	486821945	Dead Sleep	Books	2	18	21	N	Y	Skip This One	Greg Iles is a talented writer, and an especially gifted narrator.  This book, however, doesn't even begin to showcase his talent.  The premise of the book is interesting; someone is painting a series of pictures of women who are either dead or sleeping.  The main character's twin sister has disappeared and shows up as one of the subjects in the paintings.  With the help of the FBI, she tries to track down the painter---who may also be a killer.<br />The book begins with a bang, and the first few chapters will have the reader frantically turning pages.  After that, though, Iles kills the book by bogging it down with about 250 pages of nothing but dialogue.  Very little happens during this time period other than dialogue, dialogue, dialogue---which is fine in small amounts, but the plot withers and dies during this time and the reader is left bored and disappointed.  Iles could benefit from a more talented editor who could explain to him that he could easily accomplish in 2 or 3 pages what he routinely spends 20 pages writing about.  Creating good characters and believable dialogue is fine, but Iles doesn't know when to stop.  As he has done in several other books, he spends literally dozens of pages giving detailed descriptions of people who have little or nothing to do with the plot.  Once again, I don't blame Iles, I blame his editor.  I was about to give up on this one midway through but it became exciting again when I reached the last 100 pages.  The ending left me somewhat disappointed and I found myself wishing that the book had been as good as the first Iles book I ever read, Sleep No More.  If you're looking for a tightly-crafted suspense thriller, try that instead and leave Dead Sleep on the shelf.	2004-06-25

Perhaps I'm just expecting too much from the man, but Mark of the Assassin had interesting characters, a well-paced plot, and a steady stream of action.  The other books I've read by him all fall flat in comparison.  The plots seem hackneyed or totally unrealistic, there are too many long, boring passages, and the endings completely fall apart in a way that I can't believe any reader could possibly be satisfied with.  <br />Others have written good reviews for this book so obviously my opinion isn't shared by all, but Silva is dangerously close to following in the footsteps of John Le Carre' by writing books that strive to be so realistic that they end up being boring.  If I want 100-percent realism, I'll read a non-fiction book.  When I read a spy thriller I expect a moderate amount of escapism, at least enough to keep me excited while turning the pages.  For me to keep buying Silva's novels, he'll need to do a far better job than he's done over his past 3 or 4 books.	2004-06-25

His writing is far better than most spy thriller writers and is peppered with exotic European locales and interesting characters.  This is a thriller for those who snooze through all the techno mumbo-jumbo of Clancy's books and their ilk.  This is more of a character-driven thriller in the tradition of the better Robert Ludlum books.  Excitement without the special effects.  There are, of course, a few overused plot devices in this one, but all in all it's quite a fun read.	2004-06-24
US	49388126	R15NW9HEHN17O8	0312969120	499280276	Body Language	Books	2	2	3	N	N	HUGE Disappointment	James Hall is a gifted writer; that's why I can't understand why or how this book was written.  Hall writes two types of books; the series about unofficial private detective Thorn, and stand-alone books in the crime category which feature bold plots and crazy characters in the tradition of Elmore Leonard.  Body Language was obviously meant to be the second type of book, but in addition to the \\"crime-gone-wrong\\" plot which is littered with bizarre villians, there is also a second plot which is a hackneyed, boring \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" rip-off plot of the type that sprang up in dozens of horrible novels after Thomas Harris hit the jackpot with his masterpiece in the early 90s.  I honestly can't belive that anybody, especially a writer of Hall's caliber, would tackle such an overdone genre these days.  He attempts to combine the serial killer and \\"crime of the century\\" plots, which turns the book into a muddled, confusing novel that doesn't seem to know what it's trying to be.  The writing is also far below his normal standard; there are some sex scenes that are written so poorly that even the most low-paid romance writer would be embarrased to put her name on them.  Hall's dialogue in this one is also stilted and uninteresting.  In addition, the \\"mystery\\" of the serial killer is so simple and predictable that most readers will have it figured out before the first 100 pages.  Try Hall's other books if you want a good, entertaining read.  Only try Body Language if you're having trouble sleeping.	2004-06-24

But if you're an avid reader like me who is always looking for something new and exciting, you'll be as disappointed in this book as I was.  The characters were flat, unimaginative and two-dimensional.  The writing was about as exciting as the back of a cereal box.  The plot was strange and unbelievable.  Sometimes a book with these flaws can be saved by stellar prose, but that wasn't the case with this novel.  The writing was blunt, plain and unevocative.  Imagine someone without much personality---say an insurance salesman or someone who fixes air conditioners for a living---sitting you down and telling you a story about four or five uninteresting people.  That's the level of excitement that this book generated for me.  If you want well-developed characters, poetic prose and interesting plots, look elsewhere.  This was a halfway decent effort from a first-time writer, but I'm stunned and amazed that so much praise has been heaped upon such an average effort.	2004-02-13
US	49388126	RMRHFD6NS4JPB	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Unique Book	Will it change your life?  Will it make you believe in God?  I would answer probably not to both of those questions.  And although there is a blurb somewhere on the dust jacket that this book WILL make you believe in God, it's better to simply enjoy Life of Pi as a unique and funny book with some interesting comments on the human condition.  The first third of the book describes the young man's upbringing in India, his life as a zookeeper's son, and his introduction to---and confusion over---the different religious doctrines.  The next two-thirds of the book describes his ordeal when he is trapped on a lifeboat for seven months with only a tiger for company.  Both parts of the book are very enjoyable and well-written.  One reviewer said that the ending was disturbing, but it is also highly ambiguous---intentionally---and this reader may have been disturbed by something that didn't even really happen.  Take the book with a grain of salt and simply enjoy its stylish prose and offbeat humor, then look for the secrets of life elsewhere.	2003-12-09

Unfortunately, he didn't do that with this book.  24 Hours, later renamed Trapped when they made a movie out of it, is as exciting as a middle school spelling bee.  There is never any real threat to any of the characters.  The meanest of the three villians is quickly subdued early in the book, before he can truly menace anyone.  The other two villians are so weak and &quot;nice&quot; that they never seem more frightening than a half-dead roach.  Even the kidnapped little girl is never, ever, ever portrayed as being in a dangerous situation.  &quot;Mildly inconvenienced&quot; would be more applicable.  This book was a good idea that was badly executed, and I can't help wondering if the editor was at fault here instead of Iles.  I really had to struggle to keep reading this one, unlike some of the other books by Iles.  If you want to be kept on the edge of your seat, start with Sleep No More or Mortal Fear by the same author.  Keep this book around for those nights when you have insomnia and need something to put you to sleep.  It definitely worked for me.	2003-12-09

While his non-fiction works on James Bond are fairly good, his novels, unfortunately, are not.  They are simply dozens of cliches combined with references to older Bond books, all tied together with what I must simply label very poor writing.  Mr. Benson's dialogue is flat, unrealistic, and occasionally ridiuclous.  His characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic.  His prose is stilted and uninteresting.  I really wanted to like his Bond books, but after several attempts, I realized that I had assigned myself an impossible mission.<br />I have read all of Fleming and Gardener's books multiple times, but nearly put Benson's books down in the middle simply from lack of interest.  His stab at revitalizing the James Bond series was a worthy attempt, but unfortunately a failed one.  I would recommend simply re-reading Fleming or Gardener if you have a taste for more Bond in print.	2003-04-03

I have nothing against Mr. Koontz, and have read and enjoyed many of his books.  His plots have always been good, and his writing style has become pretty amazing over the past five years or so.  In fact, it's almost worth reading this book just to marvel at some of the cleverly-crafted sentences that he puts together.  But this book is basically a tiny steak with a huge sprig of parsley next to it on the plate.  The plot is the steak---tiny, undercooked and tough to swallow---while his flowery prose and engaging characters are the parsley decorating the plate and hiding the fact that the steak is actually so tiny.  We're basically given a plot of \\"boy with magical powers is fated to have huge battle with evil bad guy,\\" and the readers go through nearly 800 pages to get to this huge face-off, but it never really happens.  Instead, this book offers a watered-down plot which is never really explained, leaving us guessing what this book is actually supposed to be about.  I don't need an author to spell out his details in huge black magic marker, but I tend to think that even Koontz himself has no idea what this book is really about.  Either that, or this was originally a 1000-page megabook which was attacked by an editor who snipped out most of the important parts.  Either way, most readers are bound to be disappointed after wading through nearly 800 pages only to be left scratching their heads.  I'd recommend one of Koontz's shorter books for a safer read.	2002-09-19
