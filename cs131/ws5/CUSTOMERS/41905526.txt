And her parents are far from contrite: \\"If we could have kept one country white-ruled, it would be an oasis,\\" her inebriated mother told a visiting stranger a few years ago. Instead, Fuller's story simply presents what it was like to live and think as a white African, in whites-only communities; she does not attempt to convey the Africa beyond her immediate experience. In other words, this isn't a book about living in Africa, per se; more specifically, it is a book about being a white African.<br /><br />I imagine that the reason the racial component of her account has received the most attention--and the most resistance--from readers and critics is largely because we have grown accustomed to confessional memoirs and reflective chronicles that depict such upbringings repentantly, regretfully, or harshly. Fuller's goal is to present her youth as it seemed to her then, not as it seems to her (and us) now. In fact, appended to the end of the paperback edition is a reader's guide in which Fuller acknowledges and explains (perhaps belatedly, for some readers) that \\"almost half my life was realized in a bubble of Anglocentricity, as if black Africans had no culture worth living and as if they did not exist except as servants and (more dangerously) as terrorists.\\"<br /><br />The cultural \\"bubble\\" aspect aside, \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" is, I think, even more successful in presenting the comedy and tragedy of living in a uniquely dysfunctional family, which had more than its share of personal tragedies--including the death of three siblings. While Fuller's father was participating in combat operations on behalf of white rule against black insurgents, her mother was slowly losing her mind--descending into a maelstrom of alcoholism and madness. Some of her family's exploits have to be read to be believed. (I can't imagine what her parents, both of whom still appear to have been alive when the book was published, thought of their portrayals.)<br /><br />It's quite remarkable how the author manages to retain her sense of perspective, her dignity, and her humor (and she is quite funny, if dryly so). The other surviving aspect of her childhood is Fuller's love of her homeland--perhaps not the people, who (outside her family) are always viewed peripherally, but its \\"hot embrace\\": the sights, sounds, smells, and \\"the incongruous, lawless, joyful, violent, upside-down, illogical certainty of Africa.\\"d madness.

As with her previous efforts, however, it's still a personal odyssey; as she notes in her acknowledgments, the inspiration for the novel is her grandfather (pictured on the jacket of the hardcover edition), who \\"fought in the trenches of the German side of World War I\\" before emigrating to the United States, and whose \\"sons served on the American side in World War II.\\"<br /><br />With the change in focus comes an appropriate change in pitch: there's far less magic realism and far more European naturalism. At times, the events and characters of \\"The Master Butchers Singing Club\\" resemble those from an offbeat soap opera, but Erdrich is far too deft a writer to let melodrama get the better of her storytelling. Beyond the occasional similarity to Lynch's Twin Peaks and the Coen brothers' Fargo, the more obvious influences are the prairie towns imagined by Sinclair Lewis and Willa Cather.<br /><br />The character modeled after her grandfather, Fidelis Waldvogel, arrives from Europe with his wife and a suitcase filled with sausage, which proves to be his currency to reach the Eden he imagines to be found in the Pacific Northwest. The money earned from sales of the meat, however, gets him only as far as the godforsaken desert of North Dakota, where he eventually becomes a much-admired shopkeeper and a stalwart member of the community. On the outskirts of the town lives the novel's heroine, Delphine Watzka, who has returned to her father's home from life on the road in a vaudeville show with her alleged husband, who (it is soon revealed) lives a double life. Eventually, the paths of these two dissimilar and distinctive families cross in momentous and bizarre ways<br /><br />The novel contains enough twists and mysteries to keep the pages turning: there's a triple killing uncovered upon Delphine's return, which is all the more inexplicable because the chief witness, her father, was too drunk to remember what happened; a terrifying tunnel collapse; an eccentric bag lady known as Step-and-a-Half, who has a couple of secrets all her own; and more. While each episode and revelation ranges from the farcical to the grisly, Erdrich mitigates the potential for Dickensian excess by subtly examining the effects of these events (some of which occur offstage) on her characters and on the community. And, although her work has always been infused with a comic edge, Erdrich displays a mordant (yet not unkind) wit here that differs from the tone of her earlier work.<br /><br />Above all, Erdrich has written a celebratory and emotional ode to the \\"other\\" side of her family, whose fortitude and charisma she clearly admires (and it's not hard to see why). Although she reassures us that \\"the book is fiction except for snout salad, the bull's pizzle, and my grandmother's short stint as a human table in a vaudeville act,\\" the reverence and the affection are as raw as the North Dakota wind.which is all the more inexplicable because the chief witness, her father, was too drunk to remember what happened; a terrifying tunnel collapse; an eccentric bag lady known as Step-and-a-Half, who has a couple of secrets all her own; and more.

While I'm not sure the stories gel as a whole (in fact, the attempts to link them sometimes distracts from the effectiveness of each), each part of this triptych is an absorbing page-turner that is more accessible (without being \\"down-market\\") than is any of his previous novels. Throughout, and to showy effect, Walt Whitman's America and Cunningham's New York provide the common thematic background for the entire book.<br /><br />The first of the three stories is, I think, the most memorable and certainly the eeriest. James's \\"Turn of the Screw\\" comes to mind repeatedly, although Cunningham's tale is set in the crowded streets of late-nineteenth-century Manhattan instead of the claustrophobic English countryside. Seen through the eyes of a young boy whose older brother has just died, a victim of a ghastly accident in one of America's new sweatshops, \\"In the Machine\\" recalls the terrors, real and imagined, of the Industrial Revolution. Walt Whitman makes his only bodily appearance in the book, but there's a bit of dissonance when one of the pivotal moments recalls a famous event from 1911--nineteen years after Whitman's death. At first I thought that this was one of the story's Shyamalan-inspired moments (perhaps Whitman was another one of the story's ghosts!), but Cunningham in his preface acknowledges that events \\"may have been separated by twenty years or more.\\" So, I gather, he intentionally sacrifices historical precision for a good story, but I'm not convinced the diversion was necessary.<br /><br />Nevertheless, what makes each of these three tales fascinating is Cunningham's adventurousness and his willingness to experiment with new genres and the form of the novel itself. In the second story, \\"The Children's Crusade,\\" he shows that he can blend the horror of September 11, a detective story about pre-adolescent suicide bombers, and a knockout finale without losing sight of his intentions. The third parable, however, about an extraterrestrial nanny and a humanoid who escape New York, occasionally strikes a false note. At its best, \\"\\"Like Beauty\\" might remind readers of the better stories of Ray Bradbury (albeit, with far more lyrical writing), but at times Cunningham seems a stranger to the genre (or, perhaps, I simply read so much sci-fi that I'm more sensitive to the misfires). Still, it's got a wallop of a chase scene and two memorably humane portraits of its nonhuman protagonists.<br /><br />Finally, the linkages among the three novellas range from inorganic surface connections (i.e., the character's names in each section, the reappearance of a small white bowl) to the book's underlying themes (its homage to New York City and, of course, the influence of the Walt Whitman). But even the poetry references don't always work; in the ghost story, the young narrator blurts out seemingly random, often appropriate, sometimes obscure lines from \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" which at times nearly reduces free verse to a mutation of Tourette's syndrome.<br /><br />Still, it's been two months since I finished \\"Specimen Days,\\" and I can't get large chunks of it out of my mind. Overall, I'm beginning to realize, the manifest flaws that result from Cunningham's eagerness to take brave risks don't overpower the strength of his portraits and the thrill of his plots.cent suicide bombers, and a knockout finale without losing sight of his intentions.

These tales are weird, surprising, tense, comical, and often unforgettable--but what exactly do they all mean?<br /><br />O'Connor was often frustrated by the sense that readers and reviewers misunderstood both the intents and the themes of her stories. In her first letter to a fan from Atlanta who became a frequent correspondent, she complained that \\"she was mighty tired of reading reviews that call 'A Good Man' brutal and sarcastic\\" and that \\"when I see these stories described as horror stories I am always amused because the reviewer has hold of the wrong horror.\\"<br /><br />I think she sells herself short with this assessment, however. Her stories are brutal, they certainly can be sarcastic--and the fact that readers confuse the horror is confirmation of the ambiguous and harrowing (and, yes, Gothic) underworld her characters inhabit. The reason her stories are classics of the form--and the ten stories in this collection are among the best I've ever read--is not only because they are creepy and grotesque, or because she is the master of the ominous set-up and the unexpected ending, but also because after you've found out what happened you'll probably lie awake wondering why it happened.<br /><br />\\"Christian realism\\" was how O'Connor described her spiritual stance; \\"I write the way I do because (not though) I am a Catholic. . . .  I am a Catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness.\\" Decades of critics have argued over the theological underpinnings of her fiction, but an assessment by a fellow author named George Clay helped me make sense of her themes--and the author herself approvingly summarized his remarks in her own correspondence: \\"[Clay's] interesting comment was that the best of my work sounded like the Old Testament would sound if it were being written today--in as much (partly) as the character's relation is directly with God rather than with other people's.\\" It's not hard to find the ghosts of Job, Ruth, Samson, Esther, Isaac, Daniel, and others in all of her stories.<br /><br />Whether these echoes make for good theology will depend on the reader's own spiritual inclinations--but they certainly make good reading. My favorite piece in this collection is \\"Good Country People,\\" probably O'Connor's most famous (excepting the title story). Describing a lonely woman with an artificial leg who is seduced by a traveling Bible salesman, the story veers into an inexplicable climax that is both devastating and melancholy. And those two words pretty much sum up any of the stories you'll find here.marized his remarks in her own correspondence: \\"[Clay's] interesting comment was that the best of my work sounded like the Old Testament would sound if it were being written today--in as much (partly) as the character's relation is directly with God rather than with other people's.\\" It's not hard to find the ghosts of Job, Ruth, Samson, Esther, Isaac, Daniel, and others in all of her stories.  <br /> <br />Whether these echoes make for good theology will depend on the reader's own spiritual inclinations--but they certainly make good reading.

It's not because of the sexual descriptions, which are neither remotely erotic nor all that graphic--even for the early 1960s. Nor is it because of the Beat-genre prose and the in-your-face nihilism. Instead, \\"City of Night\\" brought to the light of day the darkest corners of the \\"gay underworld\\" (and, yes, Rechy uses the term \\"gay\\" here), and the book does it in a way that highlights the insecurities and the pretenses, the profligacy and the humanity of even the most jaded hustlers, \\"scores,\\" and \\"queens\\" who fervently frequent the bars and speakeasies in metropolitan America.<br /><br />The unnamed narrator has fled his hometown of New Orleans, initially for New York, and he finds himself both bored of the \\"respectable\\" jobs he manages to find and intrigued by the easy money (not to mention the ready drugs, the nervous thrill, and the artificial freedom) that comes from being a male prostitute. Like many of his associates, the narrator tries to convince himself that he is only \\"gay for pay\\"--that his activities are no more than a job and that in the real world he would sleep with women. But gradually he realizes that this conviction, for him and for most of the others, is little more than a pose. Among the book's many themes is the tension between the futility of the closet and its ultimate necessity (let's not forget that, in much of the country, it was illegal for two men to dance together or to wear women's clothing).<br /><br />Each chapter scrutinizes the bar scene and focuses on a different type (sometimes bordering on stereotype), from the flamboyant drag queen to the aging hustler to the married man to the older women whose guilt over a long-kept secret motivates her to tend to street boys. There are passages and scenes that will, of course, seem dated (or--to use a less loaded term--of historical interest), but many of the characters are, forty years later, hilariously and scarily recognizable.<br /><br />Finally--for reasons Rechy could not have fathomed--the most disconcerting section of the book is the last one, which is set in New Orleans. The eeriness of finishing this book at a time like this (early September 2005) is that certain passages take on a prophetic tone. The environs around the French quarter are \\"merely the remnants of what may have been; a city scarred by memories of an elegance and gentility which may have never existed. A ghost city.\\" And later: \\"An almost Biblical feeling of Doom--of the city about to be destroyed, razed, toppled--assaults you.\\" The narrator's love-hate relationship with the Big Easy--with its celebratory abandon and its remorseful gloom--instills the novel's finale with an intensity both haunting and unforgettable.y and scarily recognizable.  <br /> <br />Finally--for reasons Rechy could not have fathomed--the most disconcerting section of the book is the last one, which is set in New Orleans.

US	41905526	R2HW4KW1CZ556	0812972910	133873828	Hawthorne: A Life	Books	4	17	20	N	N	Less a literary biography than a thorough portrait of Hawthorne's social circle	Brenda Wineapple's palatable life of Hawthorne breaks little new ground, but its focus is a bit of a departure from the many previous biographies. Throughout, Wineapple concentrates on the author's family, neighbors, associates, career, finances, and politics. Such contemporary celebrities as Emerson, Longfellow, Melville, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, Horatio Bridge, James T. Field (Hawthorne's publisher), Horace Mann, and, above all, Franklin Pierce receive as much attention as Hawthorne's fiction.<br /><br />The portrait that emerges is of a career man struggling to keep his family financially solvent, resisting the emasculating temptation to be a full-time author, and clinging defiantly to the anti-abolitionist Democratic principles shared by Franklin Pierce, the hapless 14th President and Hawthorne's closest friend. While Hawthorne's acquaintances were convinced of his talents, they were dismayed by his (and his wife's) bull-headed political views. His ill-fated alliances and loyalties often cost him salaried jobs, even while they appeared to have little affect on his literary celebrity. (His publisher, for instance, was convinced that a preface honoring Pierce would sink Hawthorne's final book, but \\"to Field's amazement, the dedication didn't hurt advance sales of 'Our Old Home.'\\") Nevertheless, among members of Hawthorne's class, a career as an author--especially one who suffered extended bouts of writer's block---was not enough to pay the bills, and his inability to keep a job haunted his family with the threat of poverty until the day he died.<br /><br />Wineapple is superb at fleshing out Hawthorne's circle of family, neighbors, and friends, but--oddly enough--his literature is pushed to the background. There are certainly ample servings from Hawthorne's letters and journals, and Wineapple is somewhat more attentive to his five novels, especially how they are influenced by his political and metaphysical beliefs (on the one hand) and how their publication impacted his celebrity and finances (on the other). But she seems to have assumed that readers are intimately familiar with his tales and sketches, which, for the most part, are mentioned obliquely and glancingly. For example, a toss-away remark describing a contingent of visitors to a Union military base as \\"a group of do-gooders, spectators, and enthusiasts straight out of the pages of 'The Celestial Railroad'\\"--the only significant reference to the story--does little to elucidate or contextualize one of Hawthorne's most searing satires.<br /><br />As a social biography, then, \\"Hawthorne: A Life\\" is largely a success, and Wineapple's colloquial, almost gossip-tinged, narrative makes for easy and pleasurable reading. Readers looking for a more literary biography, however, should hunt down a copy of Edwin Haviland Miller's \\"Salem Is My Dwelling Place\\" (published in 1981), which more thoroughly treats the biographical and thematic implications of Hawthorne's fiction.lication impacted his celebrity and finances (on the other).

Figes's expansive discussion of cultural influences and trends in Russian history opens with the reign of Peter the Great and runs through the first half of the twentieth century. He makes only brief forays into the era before 1700 (e.g., the lingering effects of the Mongol invasion), and he scans the years after Stalin sketchily in a final chapter on exiles from the Soviet Union (Nabokov, but not Brodsky--although he follows Stravinsky through the early 1960s).<br /><br />Still, that's over 250 years in 600 pages, and his focus allows him to analyze what are surely the most formative years of the Russian empire. Although he occasionally examines the visual arts, architecture, politics, and scholarship, Figes primarily discusses music, performance art, and--above all--literature. Even then, there's a lot to absorb, yet remarkably the book is a refreshing survey that will not only motivate many readers (including yours truly) to run out and buy some of the novels and orchestral works he mentions but also provides a framework for appreciating all those newly purchased books and CDs.<br /><br />It's not easy to summarize the themes that, according to Figes, pervade most of Russia's culture (and politics). At the risk of oversimplification, one could say that \\"Natasha's Dance\\" views the last three centuries as a clash of dualities. Peter the Great opened Russia to European exchanges, and, by the end of his reign, society in St. Petersburg was emulating Parisian trends to the point of caricature: \\"the aristocracy had become so bilingual that they slipped quite easily and impercitibly from Russian into French and back again. Letters of a page or so could switch a dozen times, sometimes in the middle of a sentence.\\"<br /><br />During the nineteenth century, however, many writers and artists longed to pull Russia back to its roots, and they found their \\"lost\\" heritage reflected in the eyes of the peasantry. (The war with Napoleon only hastened this retrenchment.) Thus, for example, one sees the unintentionally comical specter of Tolstoy trying to be like his serfs: \\"he idealized the peasants and loved to be with them, but for many years he could not bring himself to break from the conventions of society and become one himself.\\" More seriously, by the beginning of the twentieth century, fine art was influenced less by European expectations and more by folk art and peasant dances (compare, for example, Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" with Stravinksy's \\"Firebird\\"). Nevertheless, the aristocracy continued to remain aloof from the \\"more Russian\\" customs of the peasantry--for many, the folk traditions never rose above a trendy curiosity--and this dissonance contributed to the tensions that led to the Russian Revolution.<br /><br />In many ways, Russia's history has been a search for the answer to a number of parallel questions. Is Russia part of Europe or part of Asia? Is the nation's center in St. Petersburg or in Moscow? Is its essence to be found in the cities or in the countryside? These are questions that inform Russian culture (and politics) to this day, and Figes helps the lay enthusiast understand their lasting effects.us, for example, one sees the unintentionally comical specter of Tolstoy trying to be like his serfs: \\"he idealized the peasants and loved to be with them, but for many years he could not bring himself to break from the conventions of society and become one himself.\\" More seriously, by the beginning of the twentieth century, fine art was influenced less by European expectations and more by folk art and peasant dances (compare, for example, Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" with Stravinksy's \\"Firebird\\").

He planned to adopt \\"a tone in some degree Gothic or romantic.\\" In addition, he wanted to make the fables suitable for young Christian children: \\"of course, I shall purge all the old heathen wickedness, and put in a moral wherever practicable.\\"<br /><br />I am usually not a fan of sanitized tales--even when written by someone the status of Nathaniel Hawthorne. But, in spite of their overt preachiness and their occasional preciousness, there's something charming and original about these adaptations. Even adults might enjoy these six tales: Perseus's slaughter of Medusa, Midas and his golden touch, Pandora's box (stripped of Prometheus's role), the apples of the Hesperides (or Hercules's Eleventh Labor), Baucis and Philemon and the magic pitcher (which, in my opinion, is the best of the lot), and Bellerophon and Pegasus's battle with the monster Chimaera.<br /><br />Threading these stories together is Eustace Bright, Hawthorne's college-age narrator, who relates his versions to a gaggle of local children (a couple of whom taunt him for his bumptiousness). Hawthorne uses this framing device to insert himself as his own critic. Overhearing one of the stories, the father of one of the children is not amused, finding Eustace's taste \\"altogether Gothic\\" and advising him \\"never more to meddle with a classical myth.\\" To this critique, Eustace petulantly responds that \\"an old Greek had no more right to them, than a modern Yankee has,\\" and he accuses classical writers of forming these tales \\"into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and heartless.\\" If anything, Hawthorne has certainly brought warmth to these old stories.<br /><br />Still, the reading level might be a tall order for many children under 8 (although an adult can adapt them for reading out loud). Hawthorne sprinkles his prose with salutatory references to his real-life neighbors in the Berkshires (there's even a line about Melville writing \\"Moby Dick\\") and with puns and quips that have lost their context. And he gets carried away with his descriptions of the countryside. Hawthorne's evocative passages will surely strike modern readers as hopelessly old-fashioned, although the author realized that he was trying the patience of children even from his own day. After three florid and nearly insufferable paragraphs describing a meadow, for example, Hawthorne apologetically interrupts himself that \\"we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the spring-time and the wild flowers. There is something, we hope, more interesting to be talked about.\\"<br /><br />What's more interesting, of course, are the stories of Greek gods and monsters and flying horses. Fortunately for readers young and old, Hawthorne mostly stays away from the scenery and sticks to the legends.rinkles his prose with salutatory references to his real-life neighbors in the Berkshires (there's even a line about Melville writing \\"Moby Dick\\") and with puns and quips that have lost their context.

Yet Hochschild spends a full chapter of his excellent history reminding us of the novel's historical context: the figure of Kurtz is based on at least one real-life colonial administrator, and the barbarity is not one that is indigenous to Africa but imported from Europe. Conrad's contemporary readers understood that his novel was a condemnation more of colonial tyranny rather than of African primitivism.<br /><br />And the ringleader of these gang of hoodlums who invaded the Congo and massacred its inhabitants was King Leopold II of Belgium. In a tour de force of characterization, Hochschild  portrays Leopold as a petulant and greedy monster who decided at a young age that the way to wealth was ownership of an African colony and the subjugation of its inhabitants. Leopold initially made his profits through the exportation of ivory, but his bureaucrats struck gold with the expansion of the international rubber market.<br /><br />The victims were the natives, who lost not only their land and their freedom, but often their lives. There is no pretty way for Hochschild to tell this story: Leopold's officials used unbelievably harsh methods to force the locals to collect rubber--all in the name of bringing them European civilization, Christian charity, and a Western work ethic. In addition to taking wives and children hostage (in subhuman conditions) until the men made their quotas, soldiers would torture or kill the inhabitants if they faltered. One of the most grisly aspects of this calculatingly orchestrated version of modern slavery was the severing of hands--and their collection into baskets as proof of killings--as a means of terrorizing the population. The wonder of it all is that Leopold and his agents managed to keep most of these deeds secret and even disguised his colony as a charity for the benefit of \\"pagan\\" African natives.<br /><br />Yet Hochschild's narrative is not simply a gruesome account of the horrors of Leopold's personal fiefdom--which the king himself never once visited. The most fascinating part of this tale is the creation of what might reasonably be called the world's first human rights movement. George Washington Williams, the first and perhaps bravest campaigner, initially sounded the alarm, but he was ignored largely because he was African American. Later rabble-rousers had better success: E. D. Morel, whose suspicions were aroused when he noticed the imbalance of trade to the colony while working at the docks; William Sheppard, a Presbyterian missionary who provided first-hand accounts; and Roger Casement, a British consul who became an important anti-Leopold activist (and who later became an significant figure in the Irish independence movement whose closeted homosexuality provides a sad coda to his life's story).<br /><br />One of Hochschild's themes is astonishment, only a century later, at the world's amnesia (including his own) regarding these atrocities. Even the thousands of annual visitors to Laeken's Royal Greenhouses and Winter Palace, Leopold's extravagant and luxurious monument, do not realize that this park was literally built with the lives of millions of Africans. Fortunately, thanks to Hochschild's best-selling book, as well as similar reassessments published by European historians during the last twenty years, even the briefest biographical accounts about King Leopold II now portray him as he was: a brutal and gluttonous colonial thug.eopold and his agents managed to keep most of these deeds secret and even disguised his colony as a charity for the benefit of \\"pagan\\" African natives. <br /> <br />Yet Hochschild's narrative is not simply a gruesome account of the horrors of Leopold's personal fiefdom--which the king himself never once visited.

In 1903, Jack London was hard up for cash and had just completed the manuscript. He sold the serial rights to the Saturday Evening Post for $700 and, since the editors were not all that keen on his first choice, suggested the title \\"The Sleeping Wolf.\\" (Interestingly enough, the magazine version did not even include what has probably become the book's most famous scene: when John Thornton blusteringly makes a wager that Buck can pull a sled weighing half a ton.)<br /><br />Soon after, Macmillan agreed to take a chance on the unknown writer and offered to publish the book for $2,000, with no royalties. By this time, London had warmed to his initial title, \\"The Call of the Wild,\\" but left the final choice up to his editor. Both the magazine and the book publisher reluctantly used London's now-famous title, and seven years later London wrote to his editor, reminding him of his tin ear: \\"I'll be damned if that very muchly-rejected title didn't become a phrase in the English language. This is only one of many experiences concerning titles, wherein editors, booksellers, and publishers absolutely missed.\\"<br /><br />But it still boggles the mind that London earned a grand total of $2,700 for a book that quickly sold more than two million copies.<br /><br />And what a book! I must have read it three or four times as a youngster, but even now, over twenty years since I last picked it up, it still manages to electrify me. \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is often cited as the best work of fiction ever written about dogs, but the book is equally about men--and about London himself. As a puppy, Buck is like a human child--dependent on his benefactors and with few cares in the world. But soon he is wrenched from his first home, ending up in Alaska to perform the most menial tasks in appalling conditions for a series of contemptible owners--much like the impoverished London himself who, beginning at the age of 14, went from cannery employee to oyster pirate to jute mill laborer to vagrant to prisoner to laundry worker to would-be gold prospector. In such conditions, both dogs and humans resort to their most primitive, robotic instincts.<br /><br />\\"The Call of the Wild,\\" however, is not only about descent into feral survivalism. It's also about the irrepressible yearning for independence and even solitude, and it shares a good deal, thematically, with London's social writings. If you tend to think that London's masterpiece is little more than a work of children's literature, you might want to visit it again and see how it works as an allegory. While it's certainly a great novel about dogs, it's also a perceptive statement on the human condition.e the impoverished London himself who, beginning at the age of 14, went from cannery employee to oyster pirate to jute mill laborer to vagrant to prisoner to laundry worker to would-be gold prospector.

US	41905526	R1GNGTNNFGFQLR	014100200X	751870359	The Royal Family: A Novel	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Sordid, gritty depictions of "the life" in San Francisco's underworld	The first fifty pages of \\"The Royal Family\\" reads like the opening of a Dashiell Hammett novel (the seedy ambience of \\"The Glass Key\\" specifically comes to mind). Henry Tyler, a down-and-out private investigator, has been hired by a shadowy patron to find the \\"Queen,\\" the self-appointed sovereign who oversees and protects the street prostitutes who haunt the Tenderloin's crack hotels and dark alleys. Even the last line of the first \\"book\\" (of which there are 36) has the feel of a noir thriller. Tyler attempts to pick the lock leading into the parking garage where the Queen is rumored to be hiding: \\"The lock opened on the fifth bounce. He stepped into the opening light.\\"<br /><br />In spite of this nifty, almost melodramatic hook, Vollmann has something else in mind instead of yet another piece of detective fiction. In addition to Hammett, influences extend to other San Francisco-area writers, first to the gritty realism of Frank Norris (as Tyler, like Vandover and McTeague before him, plunges into the underworld, taking most readers where they've never dreamed of going) and then to the desolate vitalism of John Steinbeck (when Tyler flees the Bay Area and mingles with the train-hopping hobos of the Central Valley and beyond). Along the way, the prose invites comparisons to Hubert Selby, John Rechy, and--yes--Thomas Pynchon. And I'm not even sure to which American literary tradition one might assign the book's vaguely supernatural elements.<br /><br />While Vollmann has a dedicated \\"cult\\" following (and, although this is my first sampling, I'm nearly ready to add my name to the registry), there are two things that will probably keep his novels from garnering the wider audience they deserve. The first is their length--and this is especially true with \\"The Royal Family.\\" Between sketches of the various destitute streetwalkers and drug-addled pretenders, he throws in just about everything: from a journalistic reflection on the mechanisms of the bail bond industry to a brutal satire on the commercial fantasias of Las Vegas. This isn't simply a novel, it's a Commitment. Still, I agree with Vollmann's decision to resist his editor's insistence to cut the book--the sections I admired or enjoyed will be different from the ones another reader will prefer. Better a smorgasbord than Lean Cuisine.<br /><br />Yet the aspect of Vollmann's fiction that will probably keep him from ever getting an NEA grant is his willingness to explore and even to empathize with the most odious of characters. (And I don't mean to include in this caste the various prostitutes, since, if anything, the author--without glorifying the life--paints a sympathetic picture.) Among all the lowlifes to choose from here--and there are plenty--the creature that will give me nightmares for years to come is Dan Smooth, a pedophile who is exploited by the local authorities for his \\"professional\\" expertise yet harassed by the feds for their revulsion to his self-confessed illness. Smooth's fantasies are uncomfortably explicit, and--even as the reader is repelled by the experience--we can admire Vollmann's heroic willingness to enter such a mind and bring him, unexpurgated, to the page. But be warned: this book isn't for the weak of stomach--or the morally righteous.<br /><br />What impresses me most about \\"The Royal Family,\\" however, is that Vollmann maintains an enviable consistency of timbre and vigor through 800 densely typeset pages. There's rarely a dull moment, and there's hardly a misstep. I can't say I enjoyed the excursion--although filled with wit and even occasional laughs, this book is too bleak and sordid to be \\"enjoyed\\"--but I was certainly fascinated by the depictions of \\"the life\\" and dazzled by the brilliance of the prose.a brutal satire on the commercial fantasias of Las Vegas.

US	41905526	R2P3EU4EISVDAS	081121592X	396291874	Borges and the Eternal Orangutans	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Poe, Lovecraft, and others--with Borges starring in the Sherlock Holmes role	In Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (considered the first true entry in the genre of detective fiction), Auguste Dupin and his unnamed narrator-sidekick investigate the double-murder of a mother and daughter, who are heard screaming and, almost immediately after, are discovered mauled to death in a fourth-story room that is locked from the inside. Eventually the sleuths uncover the truth: the \\"murders\\" were committed by a frightened orangutan, freshly escaped, who had scaled the building and then fled through the very window it had entered.<br /><br />In this slim yet packed contribution to the genre founded by Poe, Brazilian author Luis Fernando Verissimo has taken this basic concept--a dead body discovered in a locked room--and added to it some new twists and a vortex of references to Poe's many literary successors.<br /><br />The murder occurs, appropriately enough, during an international conference on Poe hosted in Buenos Aires. An obnoxious and hypercritical scholar, universally despised and feared, has threatened to demolish the theories of an American scholar. After he is murdered in the dead of night, there are no shortage of suspects: everyone knows how merciless academic rivals can be. The narrator, Vogelstein, also attends the conference and stays down the hall from the hotel room where the murder occurs. It is he who discovers the body against a mirror, apparently in the shape of a letter (Is it meant to be a V? Or does the double image formed by the reflection form an X, O, W, or M?) Before this grisly discovery, Vogelstein's claim to fame is a mangled translation of Jorge Luis Borges's work years earlier. Upon hearing of the murder, Borges steps into the Dupin-Holmes role, apparently forgives Vogelstein's previous crime of literary massacre, and accepts him as his associate.<br /><br />That's the set-up, and into this concoction Verissimo stirs so many literary allusions that it's a challenge to tease them all out. In addition to Borges and Poe, readers will find references to Lewis Carroll, Conan Doyle, Walter Benjamin, Victor Hugo, Israel Zangwill (who wrote the famous \\"Big Bow Mystery,\\" another locked-room detective story), and even Sophocles (perhaps the writer of the first murder mystery). The guest star of the book, however, is H. P. Lovecraft (and since I'm not as familiar with his tales as with those of Poe or Borges, I'm sure I missed out on some of the fun.)<br /><br />Verissimo also throws into the mix the Elizabethan alchemists Edward Kelly and John Dee. It was Dee who Lovecraft clamed wrote his fictional \\"Necronomicon\\"; in this novel, Verissimo takes Emile Borel's theory (that a monkey hitting random keys on a typewriter would eventually type every book in Frances's National Library) and claims that Dee suggested first that an orangutan with a pen could do the same. (To my knowledge, he did not ever write such a thing; Verissimo is surely mirroring Lovecraft's invention here.)<br /><br />You don't have to have read all these authors to enjoy the story, though: it's as transparent and accessible as an Agatha Christie mystery. Still, your satisfaction will be enhanced if you've experienced Borges's stories, which are short enough that one or two samples would require only a few minutes. A good place to start is \\"There Are More Things,\\" which Borges dedicated to the memory of Lovecraft and which showcases a cursed house in Buenos Aires (and in which the narrator sees a \\"V of mirrors that faded into shadows above \\")<br /><br />Also important to this novel is \\"Ibn-Hakam al-Bokhari, Murdered in His Labyrinth,\\" which boasts a pair of sleuths trying to solve a murder and includes the exchange that serves as Verissimo's epigraph: \\"Mysteries ought to be simple. Remember Poe's purloined letter, remember Zangwill's locked room.\\" \\"Or complex. Remember the universe.\\"<br /><br />And, finally, in the one-page sketch \\"Borges and I,\\" Borges writes about his alter-ego (who makes a cameo in Verissimo'snovel as well), whose \\"tastes run to hourglasses, maps, seventeenth-century typefaces, etymologies, the taste of coffee, and the prose of Robert Louis Stevenson.\\" In fact, he is so like Borges, he's \\"not sure which of us it is that's writing this page.\\"aps, seventeenth-century typefaces, etymologies, the taste of coffee, and the prose of Robert Louis Stevenson.\\" In fact, he is so like Borges, he's \\"not sure which of us it is that's writing this page.\\"	2005-08-17
US	41905526	R8ERSN4SWIF8Y	0060934905	250779400	Middle Age: A Romance	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A wickedly scathing study of suburban Candides	Readers and critics seeking a taste of American realist fiction set in the suburbs (a la Updike or Cheever--or even early Oates) will surely be baffled by \\"Middle Age.\\" While the suburban setting of Oates's novel seems \\"real\\" enough, the characters and themes in this disquietingly dark, often funny, oddly touching satire take aim at the barrenness of the noblesse oblige of the upper class.<br /><br />The parody begins with Adam Berendt, the central character whose freakishly heroic death at the outset of the book triggers mid-life crises throughout Salthill-on-Hudson, a usually sleepy Westchester County suburb. Berendt is not a man as much as he is a symbol: he represents everything that his jaded, sheltered, pampered, haughty 50-year-old neighbors wish they could be. Envied by men and adored by women, he has attained freedom, wisdom, even happiness--and his appeal is only magnified by a mysterious, possibly scandalous past. Adam's death, simultaneously admirable and meaningless, causes those closest to him to reassess their lives--even though their intimacies with him while he was alive were more imagined than real.<br /><br />Focusing alternately on five characters, the novel is structured into three distinct parts describing the initial shock caused by Adam's death, the resulting crises, and the outcomes. Marina Troy, Adam's unofficial girlfriend and the local bookstore proprietor, regrets her decision to abandon her career as an artist and escapes to a house that Adam (himself a sculptor) had deeded to her. The staid Lionel Hoffman embarks on an unlikely affair with a much younger massage therapist in Manhattan; abandoned, his wife rescues a pack of stray dogs (to which Lionel is violently allergic). Abigail Des Pres copes with her loneliness by stalking her aloof 15-year-old son--with perilous consequences. Roger Cavanagh, Adam's lawyer, provides pro bono work for an organization for death-row inmates and meets a socially progressive, aggressively contrarian legal assistant. And Augusta Cutler abandons her home and husband to unearth the secrets of Adam's past.<br /><br />Just writing this summary makes me realize just how similar \\"Middle Age\\" is to a season of \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" Sure, it's all a bit much--but it's all so recognizable. Oates moves things along with the plotting of a soap opera, the suspense of a mystery, and the bite of scathing caricature. As for \\"romance\\": Oates's subtitle refers not to her character's misguided amorous liaisons (as some readers seem to think); instead, \\"Middle Age\\" is a romance in the old-fashioned sense of the word, a study of suburban Candides who embark on pseudo-epic quests to bring substance to the empty shells of their lives and to transform their blinkered sanguinity into deserved contentment.And Augusta Cutler abandons her home and husband to unearth the secrets of Adam's past.

Once again, we meet an isolated man struggling to be an individual in a society that enforces conformity; again, the story is presented as an allegory; and, par for the genre, the prose is a dialogue-free stream of consciousness filled with run-on sentences and redundancies. I've known many readers who complain that a foray into Soviet-era literature suffers both from both datedness and repetition, that one or two samples of this stuff will suffice a lifetime.<br /><br />Yet there are two things especially that separate this short work from its counterparts. For one, it is, at times, genuinely funny. Hanta, the hero (and only real character) of the novel, is an unapologetic souse who finds offbeat amusement and accidental education from random snippets of books he rescues while at his lonely job for a waste compactor and paper recycler. While he's \\"pressing\\" his books, Hanta recalls madcap episodes from an early romance; his on-the-job inebriation summons up the ghosts of Jesus Christ and Lao-tze; he is harangued by the living stereotype of a supervisor concerned more with quantity than quality; and he makes his work more interesting by decorating his compacted cubes with lithographic reproductions of famous paintings.<br /><br />Second, there's a theme running through this work that is as relevant today in capitalist societies as it was in Communist societies. Although he clearly regards the destruction of books as \\"a crime against humanity,\\" Hanta's (and Hrabal's) nightmare isn't simply censorship. Resourceful individuals, like Hanta, have always figured out a way around that threat (even when it might mean punishment or death). Rather, the real menace is that new technologies, with their efficiencies and assembly lines, are making the creative individual obsolete.<br /><br />It's the final nail in the coffin, and Hanta fears most that, after years of furtively and slyly keeping literature alive for future generations, it will be eradicated not by further authoritarianism and censorship but by the \\"new\\" affluence and indifference exhibited by conformist youth: \\"they just went on working, pulling covers off books and tossing the bristling, horrified pages on the conveyor belt with the utmost calm and indifference, with no feeling for what the book might mean.\\" These new workers joke with their bosses, enjoy decent hours, and take vacations at new resorts. People are no longer living dangerously; instead of drinking alcohol during their breaks, these youngsters are drinking milk!<br /><br />Hrabal's message is no different than what parents tell their kids in the Western world today (and perhaps always, in every society): we've fought and died for your freedoms, and now you don't even appreciate them. After spending most of his life struggling against conformity under authoritarian rule, Hrabal is warning against complacency caused by luxury disguised as freedom.

Part parable, part bildungsroman, part romance, \\"The Story of Lucy Gault\\" describes a family who, while preparing to flee their Protestant estate during the Irish troubles, endures a far more devastating loss. But the tragedy that ultimately drives them away for good is largely a result of a series of horrifying misinterpretations.<br /><br />The book opens when a band of local dissident youths attempts an act that shatters the tranquility and security of the Gaults, who convince themselves they must flee Ireland, if only temporarily. Only nine years old, their daughter Lucy runs away, hoping to prevent her parents from leaving. Together, both acts destroy their lives of the perpetrators, of Lucy's parents, and of the family's servants and friends. Attempting to atone for the unintended consequences of her childish act, Lucy puts her entire life on hold: \\"She waited, she would have said, and in doing so kept faith.\\" The nature of the affair and the events that lead to it are so cleverly and admirably set up that I will resist the temptation to reveal any further details; I was surprised by the ease with which Trevor both lays and springs his plot's traps in the opening section.<br /><br />Many readers, however, have questioned the plausibility that the Gaults, refugees from both the political situation and their domestic tragedy, would so completely and permanently abandon their home, but Trevor is not writing a novel of historical realism. Instead, he presents both an allegory, unveiling this family's calamity as a mirror of Irish-British tensions, and a fairy tale gone bad, showing how even well-intentioned acts can wreak havoc on our lives. \\"The Story of Lucy Gault\\" takes every child's worst nightmare and makes a life out of it.<br /><br />\\"Lucy Gault\\" reminded me at times of some of Henry James's better stories and, more surprisingly, of Shirley Hazzard's \\"The Great Fire.\\" Both novels deal with loss, with escape, with war, with thwarted love, with improbable quests, with redemption; Trevor's style, too, is oddly similar to Hazzard's, although his prose is far more accessible. He manages to compact limitless detail into few words; these sad lives are exposed in a series of cryptically spun vignettes that leave much to the reader's imagination. Yet Lucy herself is a believable and fully realized character; even when you shake your head in dismay and disapproval at her decisions, you can (almost) understand why she makes them.<br /><br />In spite of its hushed, understated tone, this tight little book has the feel of a thriller; once I began it, I was compelled to read it straight through, eager to see what happens next. I then read it again, sketching in the details I missed. In Lucy Gault, Trevor has created one of his most memorable and haunting characters.f Shirley Hazzard's \\"The Great Fire.\\" Both novels deal with loss, with escape, with war, with thwarted love, with improbable quests, with redemption; Trevor's style, too, is oddly similar to Hazzard's, although his prose is far more accessible.

The source of dramatic tension and of mystery in both works issues from the guests: Who are they? Do they really exist? Are they ghosts? Are they figments of the women's imaginations? Or are we simply watching each woman's struggle with the creative process? That is, do the guests exist only as \\"characters\\" in each woman's work of art?<br /><br />In \\"The Body Artist,\\" DeLillo has incorporated an additional thematic layer. Lauren Hartke's husband, an \\"art film\\" director, has committed suicide; her new work of performance art doubles as a way of working through her grief. The unexpected visitor is an ageless idiot savant who has been hiding upstairs and who is able to recall snippets of her past conversations with her husband. Lauren's new performance piece results from their encounters, and DeLillo pointedly refers to Lauren not as a performance artist but more ambiguously as a \\"body artist.\\" She has conjured a muse in bodily form in order both to deal with grief and to create her next production.<br /><br />Lauren's recovery conveys the book's best-treated and central theme: how can one properly express grief? In fact, one could argue that the main character in the novel is not Lauren herself--the reader never really gets to know or understand her--but rather Lauren's sorrow. True, DeLillo uses this small work to struggle with other themes: the definition of art and how tragedy can inform (or hinder) its creation; the interplay between time, life, and language; the blurriness of the line between reality and imagination. But their treatment is so ambiguous that the ambiguity itself comes across as didactic.<br /><br />And, at times, DeLillo's fondness for ambiguity nearly overwhelms the book. He employs an abundance of inert, minimalist sentences with an odd overuse of pronouns and indefinite pointing words (\\"It is happening now. This is what she thought.\\" \\"It was necessary because she needed to do it. This is what made it necessary.\\"). The prose is hypnotic in both senses of the word: mesmerizing when incisive but occasionally somnambulistic in its repetitiveness and vagueness. So many sentences in DeLillo's novella begin with \\"This\\" or \\"It\\" that entire passages praised as dreamlike by one reader are just as likely to be regarded as meaningless by another.<br /><br />Throughout the novella, the outside world rarely intrudes upon Lauren's claustrophobic surroundings or the reader's imagination. When it does, the effect unintentionally borders on parody. DeLillo includes a faux-obituary and faux-review, but his canvas is too small for such gimmicks. Neither is believable as a piece of journalism; the obituary is almost frivolous, and the review is a rather sophomoric piece likely to be published only in the type of local paper that would never consider covering a work of performance art in the first place.<br /><br />The ambiguously articulated themes, the indistinct prose style, the incongruous gimmicks--everything conspires at times to confound what is a potentially brilliant \\"ghost story.\\" As a whole, \\"The Body Artist\\" dazzled me with its premise, intrigued me with its themes, and disappointed me with its execution.ity nearly overwhelms the book.

To the unprepared, this might come as a bit of a surprise; the foregoing tale has such a detached and almost callous stance that it's sometimes hard to believe that the main character is important at all to Drabble's life. In fiction as in life, the woman linked to Drabble biologically (and she makes a point of this connection) nearly escapes both the author's empathy and reader's imagination.<br /><br />Intelligent and likeable as a teenager and then as a college student, Bessie Bawtry marries a childhood friend, Joe Barron, and the transition from independent woman to stay-at-home housewife and mother turns her into a bit of a tyrant. Drabble competently depicts Bessie's self-absorption, inexplicable tantrums, hypochondria, and abusive streaks; Bessie is depicted as a victim of the struggle between matriarchy and patriarchy. Bessie's daughter, Chrissie, sets out on a similar early path: \\"She went to an ancient university because that's what she was programmed to do. She didn't know it yet, but she was programmed to follow in her parents' footsteps.\\" Chrissie is raised in a different, more progressive era, however, and she is able to avoid her mother's trajectory. Chrissie's relative success is social Darwinism informed by Bessie's mutation.<br /><br />Drabble makes much of this genetic connection; the book is \\"peppered\\" with references to Lamarckian evolution and the politics of archaeological digs. But the subject fails her as a metaphor, and there are more than a few instances where she gets the science spectacularly wrong. A silent character throughout the novel is Cotterhall Man, a prehistoric skeleton who, through the use of DNA testing, proves to be related to the local residents (obviously inspired by the real-life Cheddar Man, who became a media sensation in England for his Stone Age genes). Eventually Faro, Bessie's granddaughter, is informed by a world-famous geneticist (and here it's hard not to imagine Bryan Sykes) that she \\"is indeed a direct descendant of Cotterhall Man, as were Ellen Bawtry, Bessie Barron and Chrissie Sinclair before her.\\" Yet, as Drabble notes elsewhere, mitochondrial DNA is matrilineal; since it is carried from mothers (not fathers) to their offspring, the three modern-day women are not necessarily descended from Cotterhall Man, but rather from his mother (and, since this is a story about mothers, Drabble misses a thematic bulls-eye here).<br /><br />Novelists are famous for botching up science, however; even though she makes such a fuss over her characters' genetic heritage, one could forgive Drabble her lapses in this area. But even her prose style is eerily remote; her unadorned, uniformly patterned, primer-perfect sentences are oddly textbookish. Although she's clearly trying to write about (and understand) her mother from a remove, as if through a microscope, the reader can't help but feel that Bessie is a case study examined by an anthropologist rather than a character conjured by a novelist.<br /><br />What's agonizing about the thematic and stylistic blemishes is that they distract from an otherwise fascinating family chronicle. Peeking at Bessie's adulthood is distressingly like watching the aftermath of a train wreck; one is simultaneously fascinated and appalled by Drabble's scrutiny of her mother, and both Chrissie and Faro, as well as Bessie's sister, lead equally intriguing (and certainly more satisfying) lives. From beneath the scientific trappings, a potentially great novel is struggling to escape, and I ended the book unmoved, yet wanting to know more about these women.s hard not to imagine Bryan Sykes) that she \\"is indeed a direct descendant of Cotterhall Man, as were Ellen Bawtry, Bessie Barron and Chrissie Sinclair before her.\\" Yet, as Drabble notes elsewhere, mitochondrial DNA is matrilineal; since it is carried from mothers (not fathers) to their offspring, the three modern-day women are not necessarily descended from Cotterhall Man, but rather from his mother (and, since this is a story about mothers, Drabble misses a thematic bulls-eye here).

US	41905526	R2OW37ULS2EMXL	0393325431	642660655	The Victorians	Books	5	18	22	N	N	Opinionated and witty, a masterful chronicle from a British "fogey"	A. N. Wilson's career and writing have earned him, according to The Oxford Companion to English Literature, the \\"reputation as an acerbic and provocatively conservative critic and [as] an oft-quoted example of 'fogeydom' because of his traditional values and his High Church sympathies.\\" (Indeed, the word 'fogey' appears so often in the British press alongside Wilson's name that they have nearly become synonyms.) In one sense, then, rarely has a topic found a more apt chronicler. Conversely, I approached this book with more than a little trepidation, concerned that, in the manner of Jacques Barzun, Wilson would reflect on the nineteenth century and approvingly and longingly recount the \\"good old days.\\"<br /><br />I needn't have worried. While Wilson's history is certainly traditional in its telling, his tone is persistently skeptical, his judgment is stern, and his sensibilities--on race, on sex, on religion, on class--are firmly entrenched in the 21st century. (So much so that Gertrude Himmelfarb, the closest thing we Americans have to a fogey, panned the book in the pages of the Atlantic.) He remains enamored of its successes and legacy, yet he is clearly repulsed by its excesses and chauvinism.<br /><br />\\"The Victorians\\" isn't an introductory survey. Wilson assumes his (British) audience has heard of Gladstone and Parnell, read a little of John Ruskin, and knows when and where the Boer War occurred. If the name of Sir Robert Peel means nothing to you, then you will be lost from the opening pages.<br /><br />Instead, Wilson has crafted a review of his studies of the century, filled with delightful (and often humorous) anecdotes laced with opinionated assessments and revisionist implications. And, unlike similar topical histories, Wilson's book reads in parts like a novel (or, more accurately, a series of thematically linked stories); at times I found it difficult to put down. From his deconstruction of the myth of the \\"martyrdom\\" of General Charles George Gordon at the hands of African natives to a deft analysis of popular music-hall entertainment, from the aristocracy and the monarchy to dockworkers, child laborers, and victims of colonialism--his book leaves few aspects of the era untouched.<br /><br />Even when I disagreed with his conclusions, I enjoyed Wilson's engaging wit and (yes) old-fashioned stories too much to care. By the time I finished this immense book, I understood that his opening sentence--\\"The Victorians are still with us\\"--was offered dubiously, perhaps even ominously, but certainly not nostalgically.ordon at the hands of African natives to a deft analysis of popular music-hall entertainment, from the aristocracy and the monarchy to dockworkers, child laborers, and victims of colonialism--his book leaves few aspects of the era untouched. <br /> <br />Even when I disagreed with his conclusions, I enjoyed Wilson's engaging wit and (yes) old-fashioned stories too much to care.

Published in 1922, only four years after the end of the First World War, it is widely regarded as Cather's \\"war novel\\" and, although she visited Europe to research the battle scenes, she admitted the difficulty of writing such a novel when she had no direct personal experience of war itself. Judged simply as a war novel, then, it is certainly lacking in many respects; one won't find realist depictions of military action here. In addition, criticism that she glorified the war and its sacrifices has haunted the book since its publication.<br /><br />But \\"One of Ours\\" is instead a eulogy for her cousin who served as an officer at the Western front. Only very small portions of the book actually occur during battle, and those that do are less about fighting than about a Nebraska boy who finds himself away from home, billeting with a French family and becoming friends with a fellow officer. Like some of her other works, \\"One of Ours\\" is a perceptive character sketch of a Midwestern youth struggling to escape the confinement of life on the farm.<br /><br />The opening chapters follow Claude Wheeler from boyhood to an abortive college career, interrupted when his father insists that he leave school to work on the farm. One of the more absorbing sections describes his informal adoption by members of the Ehrlich family, who host a faux-bohemian parlor for their college-age friends and introduce Claude to Lincoln's social giddiness, intellectual intensity, and cultural pleasures: \\"He had never heard a family talk so much, or with anything like so much zest.\\" After he returns home, his life begins a less satisfactory course, first by marrying an impossible woman and then by \\"escaping\\" to the war in Europe.<br /><br />Readers and critics have often misunderstood Cather's novel; eighty years later, however, it's hard to see how anyone could say the novel prettifies combat. Instead, she probes, from Claude's perspective, those aspects of the war--camaraderie, adventure, patriotism--that entice young men to risk their lives. She explores the motives of those who serve their country while simultaneously lamenting the results. At the same time, she ridicules many of her usual targets--parochialism, bigotry, and righteousness--and lovingly portrays David Gerhardt, Claude's friend in Europe (who is based on a real-life violinist named David Hochstein). Taken as a whole, then, the novel is both Cather's celebratory tribute to \\"one of ours\\" and a grief-stricken remembrance of the tragic effects of war.e probes, from Claude's perspective, those aspects of the war--camaraderie, adventure, patriotism--that entice young men to risk their lives.

I'm always pleased to oblige the Salvation Army. According to some of the reviews you have sent me, I ought to be in it.\\"<br /><br />Throughout 1950s America--and especially in her hometown-the few readers who came across O'Connor's novel were dismayed or shocked by the its violence and its seemingly amoral characters; even two years after publication, still receiving fan letters (\\"what happened to the guy in the ape suit?\\") from the scattering of readers who liked it, O'Connor was able to joke, \\"I have now reached the lunatic fringe and there is no place left for me to go.\\" A half century later, though, O'Connor has the last laugh, because the dark humor that pervades her \\"Southern Gothic\\" tale is more readily digested by modern audiences reared on films by the likes of David Lynch and Lars Von Trier<br /><br />A quick and easy read, \\"Wise Blood\\" portrays a series of unforgettably creepy losers in haunting, disturbing scenes. Hazel Motes, a soldier discharged from the army because of an injury, becomes a street-corner preacher for the nihilistic \\"Church Without Christ\\" (with a congregation of one). He meets, and can't shake off, a friendless and troubled adolescent, and the two of them subsequently encounter an alcoholic charlatan who pretends to be a blind preacher and who hopes somehow to take advantage of Hazel by getting him to marry his young daughter. Eventually, Hazel acquires a congregant for his atheistic church, but the first disciple rebels and sets up his own ministry. There's so much more that happens, and I certainly won't give away the finale, but those who have already read the book will be intrigued by the knowledge that O'Connor decided how to end the novel after reading Sophocles.<br /><br />There's no doubt that \\"Wise Blood\\" is an influential, memorable novel--just barely short of a classic. Even its fans agree that the book seems disjointed at times--and that's because it was cobbled together from several disparate stories. The first chapter is an expanded version of her Master's thesis, \\"The Train\\"; and other chapters are reworked versions of \\"The Peeler,\\" \\"The Heart of the Park,\\" and \\"Enoch and the Gorilla.\\" Sometimes an author can use this approach and jerry-rig previous works into a cohesive whole, but \\"Wise Blood\\"--while surely a work of genius--still feels like a patchwork quilt. Fortunately, O'Connor's portrayal of the eccentrics who populate her fictional town of Taulkingham saves the book from the distraction of its all-too-visible seams.ok will be intrigued by the knowledge that O'Connor decided how to end the novel after reading Sophocles. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that \\"Wise Blood\\" is an influential, memorable novel--just barely short of a classic.

Interesting mostly from a biographical perspective, the essay tries hard--but largely fails--to share with the reader Hawthorne's enthusiasm for his new home. The rest of the volume, fortunately, is filled with grand, eerie, humorous, and memorable allegories. Every reader and critic has his or her own favorites, but a few stand out for their uniqueness.<br /><br />\\"A Select Party\\" recounts a dinner hosted by a \\"Man of Fancy\\" in \\"one of his castles in the air\\"; the guests are such improbable personages as \\"an incorruptible Patriot; a Scholar without pedantry; a Priest without world ambition, and a Beautiful Woman without pride or coquetry.\\" The thoughts and desires of the partygoers are as ethereal as the clouds they inhabit. In a similar vein, \\"The Intelligence Office\\" is a comic pre-Kafkaesque allegory of a parade of customers who seek the whereabouts (and the worth) of their long-lost desires; only a man seeking Truth unveils the Intelligencer as \\"merely delusive,\\" a bureaucrat who makes wishes come true by simply acknowledging, not fulfilling, them. \\"The Celestial Rail-road,\\" the full implications of which I appreciated only after a second reading, is a retelling of \\"Pilgrim's Progress,\\" in which devilishly clever entrepreneurs have repackaged Christian's journey through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and to the Celestial City as a Disneyland-style theme park and tourist attraction.<br /><br />Some of the stories can be read as prototypes in the genres of horror and science fiction. In the futuristic \\"Earth's Holocaust,\\" a great bonfire is lit to \\"consume every human and divine appendage of our mortal state\\": medicine, liquor, literature, weapons, money, art, jewelry, scriptures--so that there \\"is far less both of good and evil.\\" \\"The Artist of the Beautiful\\" pits Owen, a watchmaker who struggles to create a true-to-life mechanical butterfly, against a powerful village blacksmith; both contenders vie for the attentions of a beautiful woman in a classic struggle of intelligence and beauty versus technology and brute strength.<br /><br />Two of Hawthorne's most well-known tales--\\"The Birth-mark\\" and \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\"--are unsettling in their macabre Poe-like finales. Both feature scientists whose quest for what can be discovered override moral considerations of whether something should be done: the alchemist in the first story concocts a method to remove a birthmark from his wife's cheek; the second tale pits two rivals who conduct their academic warfare with potions and antidotes, using one's daughter and the other's apprentice as unwitting intermediaries. Their similar endings, while predictable, are disturbingly bleak visions of modernity.<br /><br />When this collection was reissued in 1854, Hawthorne wrote that he no longer understood the point he was making \\"in some of these blasted allegories, but I remember that I always had a meaning--or, at least, thought I had.\\" In spite of his protests, obvious themes do emerge: Hawthorne's mistrust of progress, his disdain for moral absolutism and his Puritan heritage, and his fascination with the elusive nature of evil.

True, from a modern perspective, all the Crusades are hard to defend--historically, religiously, or culturally. But the Fourth Crusade has the unique quality of being a \\"wondrous\\" and unexpected military victory against the wrong enemy, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong place, and at the wrong time.<br /><br />In August 1198 Pope Innocent III announced the Fourth Crusade and, the following year, a number of French nobles pledged themselves to the cause at the tournament of Ecry. While those who survived the resulting journey returned victorious and enriched, the crusaders never even made it to the Levant. Instead, they first negotiated a treaty with Venice for a vast fleet, but because of a shortfall of volunteers they were unable to fulfill its extravagant terms. To satisfy, at least in part, their fiscal obligations, the crusaders agreed to help the Venetians take control of the nearby city of Zara, a Hungarian (and Catholic) outpost and a mercantile power long attractive to Venetian interests.<br /><br />The successful siege of Zara, however, left the crusaders still short on food and money and still shy of fulfilling their contractual obligations to the Venetians. The situation made them doubly susceptible to the entreaties of Prince Alexius, a claimant to the throne of Constantinople who hoped to enlist the aid of the struggling crusaders to overtake the eastern city and who promised them the support needed to continue their way to the Holy Land. After twists of fate macabre and surreal enough to be the stuff of fiction, the western forces ended up ruling, at least for a while, the Byzantine Empire itself--much to the eventual horror of Innocent III, the man who had set this series of events into motion. Although a nearly forgotten episode in Western annals, the Fourth Crusade aggravated beyond repair the already fragile relationship between the Roman and Greek Orthodox churches.<br /><br />Relying largely on the original sources (which are translated and quoted in readable abundance), Phillips tells this convoluted story clearly and compellingly, and he is especially good when detailing the crusaders' tournament-honed military prowess, unraveling the diplomatic developments that got them into such a mess, and conveying the self-aggrandizing viewpoint of the crusaders themselves. His prose is far from scholarly (perhaps too far--at times I was reminded of the boyhood adventure stories written by Howard Pyle) and, although he never strays from the veracity provided by his sources, his storytelling ability resembles a novel rather than a work of history. Overall, Phillips's narrative is a great introductory survey to the temperament of medieval warfare and the events of the early thirteenth century.lready fragile relationship between the Roman and Greek Orthodox churches.

They are perfect examples of what Irving loved to do, and naturally he did them well.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, few readers ever encounter any of the other selections, except perhaps \\"The Spectre Bridegroom\\"--a comic tale of mystery and suspense. What may surprise many readers, however, is that nearly all of the book's remaining entries are about England--mostly about rural life and the landed gentry outside London, or (as described by William Cullen Bryant) \\"warm and cheerful pictures of English life.\\"<br /><br />Under the pen name of Geoffrey Crayon, Irving details his sea voyage to England, a comical fishing trip inspired by \\"The Compleat Angler,\\" a walking excursion through Little Britain (a London neighborhood), and a visit to the library at the British Museum, where he \\"soon found that the library was a kind of literary 'preserve,' subject to game laws, and that no one must presume to hunt there without special license and permission.\\" He attends a rural church service (during which he pays more attention to the congregants than the rites) and even crashes a funeral party. There are two essays on Shakespeare, a sequence of articles describing English Christmas customs, a biographical account of King James I of Scotland, and a tour of the tombs in Westminster Abbey.<br /><br />From the safe distance of his exile in England, Irving hurls two essays describing sympathetically \\"the characters and habits of the North American savage.\\" The phrase is jarring to 21st-century ears, but, while Irving repeatedly uses the unfortunate term, he simultaneously condemns that the \\"the appellations of savage and pagan were deemed sufficient to sanction the hostilities of both [colonists and writers].\\" Regardless of its bipolar sensitivity to language, the first essay is a rousing defense of Native Americans: \\"They cannot but be sensible that the white men are the usurpers of their ancient dominion, the cause of their degradation, and the gradual destroyers of their race.\\" The second essay is a portrait of King Philip, or Metamocet of Pokanoket, the 17th-century chief of the Wampanoag tribe whose conflict with the New England settlers resulted in the near-eradication of his people.<br /><br />Irving has a tendency to dilute his delight with an abundance of detail, but his mastery of the quip and his sarcasm--so abundant in his \\"History of New York\\"--is still on display throughout \\"The Sketch Book.\\" Its unevenness, ponderousness, and lack of thematic coherence can be challenging, however, and those looking for fiction rather than \\"sketches\\" may prefer (as I did) Irving's \\"Tales of a Traveller,\\" which is comprised entirely of ghost stories, pirate adventures, and tall tales.emed sufficient to sanction the hostilities of both [colonists and writers].\\" Regardless of its bipolar sensitivity to language, the first essay is a rousing defense of Native Americans: \\"They cannot but be sensible that the white men are the usurpers of their ancient dominion, the cause of their degradation, and the gradual destroyers of their race.\\" The second essay is a portrait of King Philip, or Metamocet of Pokanoket, the 17th-century chief of the Wampanoag tribe whose conflict with the New England settlers resulted in the near-eradication of his people.

When we initially meet him, he is keeping a scrapbook of the 100 most famous people in his country, and he supplements his hobby by illicitly (and in violation of official policy) sneaking into the Registry at night to collect the records for these celebrities.<br /><br />Then, one day, he accidentally picks up a card of an anonymous, random woman--someone whose life and happiness are foreign to tabloids and magazines. His inexorable obsession (who is she? where does she live? what is she like?) snaps him out of his meaningless existence and propels him, like a modern-day Don Quixote, on a bizarre, increasingly absurd journey to find out what he can about her. His regulation-breaking pursuit motivates him to fabricate credentials, to burglarize a school, to sleep in a cemetery that mirrors the Registry (except that it houses only the dead), and eventually to invite the attention of his superiors.<br /><br />Dense and ponderous, Saramago's unpunctuated prose is, remarkably, seldom dull; what's extraordinary about this book is the suspense, the tension, the humor, and the sarcasm that keeps his narrative moving. There is almost a noir atmosphere behind this story, as the reader nervously follows a man who, drowning in a sea of daily tedium, can't resist the impulse to find the humanity behind \\"all the names\\" he files away in the registry.

The novel ends four years later, after he has published one of his most popular stories, \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" and just before James finished two of his best and most successful novels, \\"The Ambassadors\\" and \\"The Wings of the Dove.\\"<br /><br />Yet Toibin, wisely, doesn't limit his novel's domain to the last four years of the nineteenth century--a tranquil period of transition that James largely spent at his newly acquired pastoral estate, Lamb House. Instead, many of the chapters serve as a launch for flashbacks to earlier periods of James's life: his brothers' enlistment in the Union Army during the Civil War, the death of his sister Alice, and, most effectively, his friendship with the doomed Constance Fenimore Woolson. Along the way Toibin suggests people and events that served, obviously or subtly, as inspiration for James's fiction.<br /><br />Toibin also explores the aspect of James that has received the most scrutiny in recent decades: his confused and repressed sexuality. A number of set pieces and suggestive episodes portray an artist who is alternately troubled and paranoid and melancholic: his reaction to Oscar Wilde's scandalous trial, an ambiguous relationship with Oliver Wendall Holmes, Jr., an invitation to write a tribute to the aesthete John Addington Symonds. Yet, in the end, he triumphs over adversity, and this is nowhere more powerfully portrayed than in the account of a tense and combative visit by his brother William, who always treated Henry as an undisciplined and flighty younger brother.<br /><br />As faithful as it is to James's biography, Toibin's work is, above all, a work of fiction: there are some purely speculative episodes and, of course, James remains an enigmatic figure. In addition, a number of events, such as James's perversely funny experience with his alcoholic servants, occurred well into the 1900s and are collapsed into earlier years for dramatic purposes. Some readers have complained that, even as fiction, \\"The Master\\" is not that compelling if you are not acquainted with James's massive oeuvre. Although I'm familiar with James's career and his influence, I've read only three or four of his shorter works (and none of them very recently)--yet I found that the novel had the opposite effect: I now want to read much more of his fiction, particularly the novels and stories he wrote during this period and afterwards.

It is not a historical chronicle per se; instead it is a chronological sampling of biographical profiles of major and minor thinkers and how they viewed, with admiration and mistrust, capitalism and the \\"free market.\\"<br /><br />Muller examines the careers and thoughts of thinkers from the eighteenth- and nineteenth-centuries (from Adam Smith to Karl Marx), as well as more recent writers (such as George Lukacs and Friedrich Hayek) and lesser known intellectuals (Hans Freyer and Werner Sombart). An intriguing subplot of sorts that runs through these chapters is the societal and academic view of the role of Jewish populations in the development of the market; such views, even among the best thinkers (with few exceptions), tended to be harsh and simplistic. Muller's book does not in any way pretend to be comprehensive--he admits in the introduction that the authors under discussion \\"are drawn disproportionately from German-speaking Europe\\"--but this tighter focus allows for a better, more coherent narrative.<br /><br />\\"The Mind and the Market\\" is at its best when it sticks to intellectual history; when Muller turns to economic history, however, he occasionally falters (or, more accurately, his discussion is nakedly incomplete). In his largely unimpeachable comments on Marx's myopia, for example, he counters that capitalist development in the late nineteenth century lead to better working and living conditions in England, as well as \\"improved standards of health and safety in one industry after another.\\" Such a description of the standard of living is true, but \\"capitalist development\\" is only half the story and even that story applies to only to the island and not the empire. The British Isles also benefited from colonialism: unprecedented wealth entered the country at the same time that significant chunks of its labor supply shipped overseas to jobs in civil service and the military--often never to return (60,000 died in the Crimean War alone).<br /><br />Similarly, Muller notes correctly that Hayek's economic theories have gained much prominence during the last three decades, but his arguments for their exoneration is a bit one-sided. He notes the deregulation and tax reduction in the United States during the 1980s but fails to admit the un-Hayek escalation in government spending (at both the federal and state levels) and in budget deficits.<br /><br />Fortunately for the reader, however, such details, which comprise only small portions of the book, are beyond its scope and in no way compromise the integrity of Muller's discussion of these great thinkers. Taken as a whole, \\"The Mind and Market\\" amply displays the love-hate relationship between philosophers and capitalism and how that relationship has evolved during the last two centuries.ply shipped overseas to jobs in civil service and the military--often never to return (60,000 died in the Crimean War alone).

Its farmer-hero, Steinar of Hildar, is a pastoral Don Quixote, a study of the innocence of a man who seeks meaning and \\"paradise\\" for himself and his family, who cannot bring himself to think ill of others, and whose optimism and faith is unshakable.<br /><br />Steinar's journey is not an easy one--for him or for his family; their trusting naivety is no defense against the guiles of those who think themselves wiser and better. Steinar's tale begins when he selflessly offers a pony, the beloved pet of his children, to the king of Denmark, who in return offers expenses-paid hospitality in his realm. On his pilgrimage to visit the king, Steinar crosses paths, several times, with a persecuted Mormon bishop who is proselytizing in the countryside; the bishop regales the farmer with tales of an earthly paradise: Utah. (The Mormon element of the novel is not gratuitous, by the way. A definitive study of Scandinavia, by T. K. A. Derry, notes that during the years 1873-90, at least 12,000 Icelanders--out of a population of 70,000--emigrated to the North America in large part because of Mormon conversions.)<br /><br />Steinar's subsequent travels eventually take him to Utah, where he hopes to bring his family to share in the earth's bounty. Little does he know that his equally gullible and simple wife and children have fallen victim to a series of scoundrels, particularly the local sheriff, who has made a career of seeding his offspring among the adolescent girls in his parish.<br /><br />How Laxness ties together these strands of folklore and adventure is fascinating and ambiguous, heartwarming and odd--and it is bizarrely unforgettable. I'm still puzzling over what Laxness's novel actually \\"means\\"--if, indeed, a clear moral is meant at all--but the haunting characterizations and the compassionate portrait of his homeland alone are the stuff of poetry.ally \\"means\\"--if, indeed, a clear moral is meant at all--but the haunting characterizations and the compassionate portrait of his homeland alone are the stuff of poetry.	2005-05-16

In \\"The Amateur Marriage,\\" as in her best fiction, she blends commonplace yet remarkable lives with a tightrope act over the comic and the tragic.<br /><br />Spanning sixty years, Tyler's sixteenth novel follows the triumphs and the travails of Pauline and Michael Anton--a dysfunctional and mismatched couple who think they have fallen in love before Michael ships off for war, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and who end up raising three children in a household teetering between conjugal stalemate and all-out warfare. Tyler throws in for good measure an additional subplot: one of the children vanishes and, years later, they find themselves burdened with a grandchild (named, appallingly, Pagan) by a daughter who has removed herself from their lives.<br /><br />Attentive as always to the innocuous and mundane details of suburban life, Tyler avoids sentimentality; in spite of the plot, her novel never threatens to become a soap opera. Alternating between Michael and Pauline's viewpoints, each chapter is an episode in family life, and many of the events, major and minor, that occur between are implied or left to the reader's imagination. The structure of the book resembles ten chronologically ordered short stories as much as it succeeds as a novel.<br /><br />And Tyler certainly has much to say about bad marriages, as well as marriages in general, and their aftermaths. (Tolstoy's famous opening line for \\"Anna Karenina\\" could well serve as the thesis for this book.) Divorce and even death continue to shape surviving spouses and children; subsequent events and relationships are always viewed through the prism of an earlier marriage. And, yet, Tyler never loses her senses of perspective and humor; there are some unexpectedly funny and ironic moments resulting from this tragic household. She is one of few authors who can salvage something worthwhile and worthy from such a despairing and bleak amateur act.eur act.	2005-05-15

The very presence of a mutant like the Mule has thrown off course the inexorable historical trajectory plotted by the psychohistorian Hari Seldon, who (as readers of the previous volumes know) planted the seeds for an accelerated rebirth of a new empire after a thousand-year intergalactic Dark Ages. The second half, \\"Search by the Foundation,\\" pits several of the leaders of the resurrected First Foundation against the (real or imagined?) threat posed by the Second Foundation.<br /><br />The Foundation books were originally written as a series of eight interconnected stories (plus an opening chapter written for book publication), so their arrangement as a trilogy is rather random--and that leads to this book's only significant fault. The first half of \\"Second Foundation\\" is a continuation of the Mule's reign of terror that began in the second half of \\"Foundation and Empire\\"; they are the only two stories in the series that share a lead character. Their separation into two books arbitrarily contributes to an odd lack of cohesion, and if it has been a while since you read the second volume you might find yourself confused. (Had Asimov originally planned these books as a trilogy rather than a series, these two halves would have, together, comprised a nearly seamless novel.)<br /><br />On the plus side, what is noticeable in this final volume is how much better Asimov's writing had become by the time he wrote the last story. (The first Foundation story, \\"The Encyclopedists,\\" was written when he was only 21; the final installment was published when he was 28 and after he had completed graduate school.) In addition, his humor is more mature, his science more speculative, and his characterizations more complex.<br /><br />Even the multiple twists and turns in \\"Second Foundation\\" are the sign of a more confident writer.

I want her to stand out--like this--like this--because she is the story.\\"<br /><br />This anecdote (recounted in James Woodress's biography of Cather) sums up almost exactly the technique that makes her novel both unique and unusual. Instead of writing the story from her heroine's point of view, or from the point of view of an omniscient narrator, Cather instead creates a bystander, the likeable and somewhat innocent Jim Burden, who has written down a series of memories where his and Antonia's lives intersect; \\"My Antonia\\" is a biography through the mask of autobiography. While this is Jim's story as much as it is Antonia's (she is barely mentioned at all in Book III), we are ultimately studying a much-loved thing of beauty from \\"all sides\\"--from the distance separating it and the observer.<br /><br />Although \\"My Antonia\\" relates a number of exciting, sentimental, horrifying, and even scandalous incidents (none of which will be divulged here), Cather very deliberately chose to write a character novel rather than an action story. Many of the book's pivotal \\"events\\" happen offstage; we learn what has happened only when Jim hears about Antonia or runs into her at a gathering or stops by her home. Such a detached approach is a departure from that used by many of the American naturalists (e.g., Dreiser, Lewis) writing during this period, yet her book is surely a model of realism. As Jim writes when he notes his reluctance to visit Antonia when they are both grown, \\"Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again.\\"<br /><br />As with all of Cather's novels, the prairie town of Black Hawk (which, is of course, Cather's hometown of Red Cloud), is populated with a variety of hirelings and homesteaders, dreamers and pretenders, romantics and scoundrels. (Cather seldom sketched a character as downright wicked as the would-be rapist Wick Cutter.)

Things that should never have happened, that seemed out of place and wrong, these were what prevailed, what endured, in the end.\\" Even Gogol's name is the result of an accident. Named after the Russian author, whose work his father was reading at the time of a nearly fatal railway crash, Gogol tries to, but ultimately cannot, escape either his name or his heritage.<br /><br />After an arranged marriage and before his birth, Gogol's parents settle in Massachusetts, where they spend weekends entertaining and visiting other Bengali families. Gogol's father, Ashoke, slowly accommodates himself to his life as an American professor, but Ashima never stops considering Calcutta as her home. Gogol, quietly embarrassed by his parents' provincialism, does everything he can to shun his Indian heritage and to fit into a mostly white, Birkenstock-footed crowd. (He and his sister especially resent their long visits with their extended family in Calcutta.)<br /><br />While Gogol is struggling to escape the accidents of his heritage, his father is ineffectively attempting to relate to his son; one of the most heart-wrenching episodes is when Ashoke presents his indifferent son with a copy of Gogol's stories. Lahiri is at her best in presenting these two themes: the duality experienced by second-generation Americans and the acid-sweet schizophrenia generated by the typical father-son relationship.<br /><br />Lahiri's prose is also in top form. Her omniscient voice alternates among characters, sketching their outlines before zooming in on specific incidents or traits. Her story will cover the events of several years in a few pages, almost as if she were writing a biographical essay; then we will read in minute detail about a particular tragedy, a family reunion, or even an idiosyncratic yet everyday routine, such as how Ashima has purchased and maintained her various address books or when the young Gogol and his father walked along a beach to a lighthouse. I can understand how some readers feel that the expository sections are too emotionally detached, but the contrast surely heightens the impact of the more intimate passages.<br /><br />The invisible presence throughout \\"The Namesake\\" is the ghost of Nikolai Gogol, and I can't speak to the parallels between the novel and his fiction. Like the protagonist of Lahiri's book, I too have a copy of his collected stories--a gift from a beloved friend--that has been sitting for many years on a bookshelf, untouched and unopened.

In The Angler's Rest, an oh-so-British pub, Mulliner holds court--or, more precisely, he overwhelms the possibility of alternative banter among the regulars. The slightest conversational tidbit or abbreviated anecdote will set Mulliner off on a shaggy-dog story about the improbable escapades of one of his relatives, and each tale follows a similar blueprint, culminating in the expected \\"saved-from-a-tough-spot\\" resolution or (more often) a boy-gets-girl finale.<br /><br />As always with Wodehouse, to sum up the plot of one story is to sum up all of them; instead, the devil is scattered, liberally, in the details. The pleasure of reading his tales arises not from discovering what happens--nor from even from seeing how it happens--but from the slapstick follies and rapid-fire wit of the character sketches who populate his world. Still, there are three stories out of the nine in this volume that stand out because they form a continuum of sorts; one might even call the trilogy an accidental novella. They feature common characters: the pharmacist William Mulliner, his wife Angela, their nephew Augustine (a curate), and the bishop of Stortford. The comedy results from the unexpected results produced by William's toxic and not-yet-patented concoctions--especially Buck-U-Uppo, which seems to have all the redundant power of Red Bull laced with a jolt of amphetamine. And it's absolutely priceless when Augustine addresses his superior with a greeting like \\"Cheerio, bish. How's the lumbago today?\\"<br /><br />Ironically, the memorable nature of these three consecutive stories reminds me why I prefer Wodehouse's novels, in which the humor inexorably builds to an uproarious crescendo. I will always get a kick out of Wodehouse's shorter fare and the diversions they supply, but their impressions consistently fade as soon as the laughter dies down.	2005-04-19
US	41905526	R2O76HWA2PQAV4	1565549457	395739002	Knickerbocker's History of New York, A: Knickerbocker's History of New York (Volume I)	Books	4	23	24	N	N	"How the town of New Amsterdam arose out of the mud"	In 1809 Washington Irving published \\"A History of New York,\\" the work that make him instantly famous. Conceived as a parody of Samuel L. Mitchill's guidebook \\"The Picture of New York\\" (1807), Irving's \\"History\\" purports to be written by the fictitious Diedrich Knickerbocker. It was, perhaps, the first American book to be embargoed by the publisher--that is, it was published in Philadelphia to keep its contents secret from the press in New York. Before the book was published, Irving and his friends even coordinated a hoax through the local papers, publishing a series of notices advertising Knickerbocker's inexplicable disappearance: \\"there are some reasons for believing he is not in his right mind,\\" and \\"a very curious kind of written book has been found in his room.\\"<br /><br />The book was such a success that Irving revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, and readers should note which edition they are purchasing. Most recent editions reprint either the original text or the last revision, which are so different that they may as well be considered different works. By the time of the Author's Revised Edition of Irving's collected works, published in 1848, Irving had completely rewritten over a tenth of the book, added about 7,000 words of new material, softened the sarcasm, eliminated the mocking references to Jefferson's presidential administration, removed many risque passages and double entendres, and polished the overall style. The barbs are more personal in the earlier edition; Irving aimed his parody more broadly forty years later. In sum, while the earlier edition was considered more scandalous--even \\"naughty\\"--and cheekier in its wit and tone, the last edition is certainly more polished and \\"mature\\"--and might be considered by many as noticeably easier to read. (The remainder of this review focuses on the 1809 edition.)<br /><br />The book's conceit is that the fictitious Knickerbocker, a Dutch descendant, nostalgically mourns the passing of Dutch hegemony on the island of \\"Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan,\\" and he offers a rousing defense (read: mock hagiography) of the Dutch governors. But Irving's satire is aimed not simply at the long-dead colonists of New York; his depictions of various Dutch leaders evoke many of his contemporaries. Thus, Wilhelmus Kleft seems an awful lot like Thomas Jefferson, and Jacobus von Poffenburgh recalls General James Wilkinson (who was caught up in Aaron Burr's allegedly treasonous schemes against Jefferson's government). The \\"hero\\" of the book, however, is Peter Stuyvesant, whose glorious qualities are manifold--even if his rule was considered authoritarian and his last act as governor was to rebel against his own king, who had ceded Manhattan to his brother, the duke of York.<br /><br />Irving, as Knickerbocker, also mocks the pretensions of historical scholarship. He offers philosophical justifications for the obesities of city leaders (\\"Who ever heard of fat men heading a riot?\\") and praises the well-honed Dutch civil defense against Yankee encroachments (\\"Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still better, a more economical measure devised, than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation.\\"). He interrupts his narrative several times with admonishments to the reader or faux biographical meanderings, and, near the end of the book, he acknowledges that his tone has changed from that of a \\"crabbed cynical, impertinent little son of a Dutchman\\" to a \\"most social, companionable regard.\\" Of the many readers that began his book, \\"some dropped down dead (asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter, took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight . . . Every page thinned my ranks more and more.\\"<br /><br />This last self-deprecatory joke is certainly the case for modern would-be readers: Irving's archaic prose can be a slog, and his historical and literary references will perplex even the most arduous. But not all the humor is dated, and quite often patient readers will be rewarded by a comment or pun that may even cause them to laugh out loud.nd literary references will perplex even the most arduous.

The narrator, unironically named Orhan, reconstructs the days during which his friend Ka, the book's protagonist and a struggling poet, visited the isolated town of Kars to write an article for a paper in Istanbul.<br /><br />\\"Snow\\" is constructed like several colorfully painted matryoshkas: a novelist writing about a poet posing as a journalist; Ka is trapped by \\"kar\\" (snow) during his visit to Kars. The townsfolk both welcome Ka as a dignitary of sorts and mistrust him as too \\"Westernized,\\" because he has spent the previous twelve years as an exile in Germany. Their mistrust is not entirely misplaced, since the motives for Ka's visit are not purely professional: he hopes to rekindle a relationship with the lovely Ipek, whom he had known as a student.<br /><br />The \\"plot\\" of any political satire can be difficult to summarize, and \\"Snow\\" is especially labyrinthine. Ka's assignment is to write about the (exaggerated) reports of girls who have been committing suicide rather than remove their headscarves in school, as proscribed by law. As the story progresses and the town's secrets are unveiled, Ka manages to be in the presence of a series of unfortunate events (and these are just in the first few chapters): Ka witnesses the assassination of the director of the institute that had enforced the headscarf laws; Ka and Ipek's former husband are both arrested and the latter is brutally treated the secularist regime; Ka meets Blue, an Islamist fugitive and alleged terrorist; and Ka reads a poem at a theatrical production that turns violent when the local army guns down religious students who jeer the play's secularist message.<br /><br />Although complex in its themes and occasionally nonlinear in its plot, \\"Snow\\" is surprisingly readable--and this is in large part because of its acid wit. Using equal doses of exaggeration and derision, Pamuk mocks Turkish political divisions: the Ataturk-inspired secularists, who fear that Turkey may become another Iran; the Islamists, who view as evil anything tainted with secular or Western influences; and the Kurdish nationalists, whose own agenda is almost comically ignored by the other two factions.

The son of an esteemed, philandering literary critic, William Henry \\"Hank\\" Devereaux, Jr., is a tenured professor at the third-rate West Central Pennsylvania University. He boasts one well-received, seldom-read novel (albeit written two decades earlier) under the belt of his \\"tenured paunch,\\" but he's \\"not the only who no longer considers [himself] a writer.\\" His agent has finally struck him off her Christmas card list.<br /><br />Elected interim department chair of the English department, Hank refuses to take any of his colleagues seriously. He serves as the perfect foil for academic paranoia and petty rivalries, and his wise-guy repartees just as often result in a bloody nose or having his car run off the road as they do in grievances filed against him (fifteen and counting). The parting shot from his wife, who is leaving town--ostensibly for a job interview--is, \\"I have this fear. I can't decide where you're going to be when I get home. In the hospital or in jail.\\" (I'll leave it to the prospective reader to determine the accuracy of this prediction.)<br /><br />Having just finished Michael Chabon's \\"Wonder Boys\\" a few months ago, I was struck by the common elements: each book features a middle-aged English male professor/novelist living in Pennsylvania, battling unspecified medical ailments that cause mental brownouts, dealing with a 20-year-old case of writer's block, barely stringing along their agents, avoiding intra-departmental feuds, balancing personal friendships and professional antagonisms with administrators, supervising would-be student writers, and flirting with disaster as soon as the wife is away (by desertion in one book and for business in the other). Dead dogs, transvestism, and seedy bars figure--bizarrely--in both plots as well.<br /><br />Yet, surprisingly, these similarities are entirely superficial; Chabon and Russo have written two very different--but equally hilarious--books. Chabon focuses on the relationship between teacher and student, while Russo lampoons university politics; in \\"Wonder Boys,\\" Grady Tripp descends almost willingly into a private maelstrom, while in this book Hank Devereux attempts to remain above the fray. Arrogant, aloof, antagonistic--Hank is not always the most likeable hero, but his integrity is rarely in doubt.<br /><br />And the humor is different as well. Russo's forte is rapid-fire banter, the perfect riposte, and convincing caricature; he depends far less on slapstick or situation comedy than many academic parodies. Yet Russo delights in the occasional set piece: Barely a day after his wife's departure, Hank ends up on national television in a Groucho Marx nose-and-glasses, threatening to kill a duck a day (while holding a goose) if he doesn't get his department budget \\"in unmarked bills by Monday morning.\\" Then there's the scene in which, almost inadvertently, Hank is hiding in the ceiling crawl space, spying on the proceedings of a departmental meeting below.<br /><br />\\"Like most academics,\\" Hank's colleagues are \\"fascinated by childish, unprofessional conduct,\\" which, oddly enough, makes him the perfect candidate for department chair.

After Ackerley returned from India, he spent several years touching up his diary for publication; he changed the names, toned down the sexual content, and removed passages that might be considered libelous. This recently published version is the first unexpurgated American edition, with all the cuts restored.<br /><br />Ackerley's intent was to be mischievous and outrageous and comic; and his book became both a critical hit and, to everyone's surprise, his most commercially successful work. The book is at its best in its humorous depictions of the Maharajah, his private secretary Babaji Rao, and the contingent of valets, including the endearingly sweet Sharma and Narayan. For the most part, Ackerley's portraits are nonjudgmental and fond; he reserves his venom for the British guests and, to a lesser extent, for his sycophantic tutor, Abdul, and clumsy servant-child, Habib.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Hindoo Holiday\\" there is a disconcerting, even creepy, undercurrent that revolves around the sexual despotism of the Maharajah, whose predatory advances are directed towards the \\"Gods\\"--his name for the boys in his employ. \\"Boys\\" is Ackerley's term; at least one is identified as being twenty and several are married, so it's possibly more accurate to call most of them young men. But, whatever their age, these youngsters are compelled to have sexual relations with the Maharajah--and with his wife while he's watching. Complicating this issue is the subtly hinted possibility that the ruler is suffering from the advanced stages of syphilis. (The paternity of the palace's heirs is a great mystery, as well.) Only a few of the youths seem able to withstand his advances, and Ackerley often must come to the defense of Narayan, one of the \\"Gods\\" who refuses to comply.<br /><br />Ackerley reports these incidents with disquieting aplomb. His own role in these matters is rather innocent; according to biographer Peter Parker, he limited his affections to kissing and holding hands: \\"If he had sexual relations whilst in India, he left no record of the fact.\\" (And Ackerley was not known for being shy about such matters in either his journals or correspondence.) Nevertheless, intentionally or not, the goings-on in the palace are emblematic of the corruption, indolence, and decadence of the British Raj.<br /><br />Most modern readers, then, will find much of the tone and material and humor in \\"Hindoo Holiday\\" a bit dated. Yet Ackerley's memoir is still an accurate portrait of the time--and there are moments of brilliant hilarity.omply.    Ackerley reports these incidents with disquieting aplomb.

In 1913, working on a piece for McClure's magazine, Cather interviewed the opera star Olive Fremstad, who had been born in Sweden and raised in Minnesota. By coincidence, the night of their first meeting, Cather went to see a production at the Met; right before the performance was to begin, the director learned that the lead singer had fallen into a dead faint. With only minutes to prepare for the role, Fremstad agreed to fill in, and Cather was amazed that the tired, faded, unapproachable star she interviewed earlier in the day had somehow transformed herself into \\"a vision of dazzling youth and beauty.\\"<br /><br />From this kernel grew the story of Thea Kronborg, the heroine of \\"The Song of the Lark,\\" which is Cather's portrait of the diva as a young woman. The first part, \\"Friends of Childhood,\\" is standard bildungsroman fare: a young farm girl from a large family in Moonstone, Colorado, grows up and moves to the big city--in this case, Chicago--to pursue her dreams. The early sections of the book are pure Cather: a strong-headed yet friendly young girl surrounded by a colorful cast of multi-ethnic characters, from the anonymous tramp who drowns himself in the water tank to her alcohol-fueled German music teacher to the lively free-spirits living in the Mexican section of town. Nearly a novel unto itself, this opening section sketches the entire town of Moonstone with a multiplicity of tragicomic details<br /><br />When Thea moves to Chicago, however, both her character and the book's tone changes. Initially her studies go well, but she finds her artistic growth chained by the expectations of the folks back home. Her awakening occurs when she travels to the American Southwest and stays near the ancient dwellings of the cave-dwellers; her removal from the influence of her Moonstone family and the stress of her Chicago education results in her emotional breakthrough. Thea realizes she will find success only after she has stripped away the vestiges of her countrified upbringing and forfeited her life, her friends, even her self to her art. Thea offers explains this sacrifice in terms similar to what the real-life Olive Fremstad told Cather: \\"It takes you up, and uses you, and spins you out; and that is your life. Not much else can happen to you.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Song of the Lark\\" melds two seemingly disparate literary traditions: the Western realism of the book's first half recalls Sinclair Lewis and the drawing-room sophistication of the later sections evokes Edith Wharton. (I was surprised by how much the first two sections reminded me of Dreiser's \\"Sister Carrie.\\"). The disparity was intentional: Cather's premise is that the artist must completely transform herself if she expects to shake the dust off her childhood moccasins and step into the heels of an artiste. Similarly, that very transformation (and the length required to present it) is what makes Cather's novel so difficult for many readers: in order to become a star, Thea turns into a self-centered prima donna, a character who may be admirable but who is not always very likeable.<br /><br />Incidentally, there are two very different versions of \\"Song of the Lark\\" available. Most editions reprint the 1915 text, since it is in the public domain. This earlier version is far more detailed and, some have argued, overwritten; her British publisher complained that she \\"told everything about everyone.\\" For the 1932 Autograph Edition, Cather revised the book substantially, cutting it by seven thousand words and streamlining the overall text. Descriptive passages were pared; Thea's and Fred Ottenburg's roles were altered; and style, opinion, and matters of taste were polished and modernized. This version is still under copyright restriction, and I believe it is available only in the Mariner Books (Houghton Mifflin) edition. The original version is regarded by manyreaders and scholars as better (and certainly truer to Cather's original intent); this is the book that Mencken praised for its \\"sharp bits of observation, sly touches of humor, [and] gestures of that gentle pity which is the fruit of understanding.\\"r (and certainly truer to Cather's original intent); this is the book that Mencken praised for its \\"sharp bits of observation, sly touches of humor, [and] gestures of that gentle pity which is the fruit of understanding.\\"	2005-03-10

His 650-page essay, much of it originally published in The New Yorker, recounts his travels on Interstate 80, during which he was accompanied by several geologists. As a whole, it is simultaneously an admirable work of awe-inspiring description and astonishing detail and a frustratingly random compilation of theoretical research and overwhelming arcana.<br /><br />Throughout, McPhee focuses on two geological theories: plate tectonics and continental glaciation, with an emphasis on the former. The four books cover various areas of the United States, out of order: Nevada, New York City, Pennsylvania and the Appalachians, Wyoming and the Rocky Mountains, and California's Central Valley and its flanking mountain ranges. To complete his tour across the continent, he has added a new, relatively short essay, ''Crossing the Craton,'' which encompasses the Great Plains and Great Lakes region.<br /><br />Along the way, McPhee intersperses what he calls \\"set pieces\\" and \\"time lines,\\" which place geological research in currently held theoretical and chronological contexts: the origins of coal and petroleum, the differences between field geologists and \\"black box\\" geologists, a reconstructed view of what Kansas may have looked like during the Middle Proterozoic era. He also interrupts his travels with riveting accounts of notable historical events, from the California Gold Rush to the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco.<br /><br />Most of the book is endlessly fascinating largely because McPhee is an accomplished prose stylist who can describe just about anything and also because he can be very, very funny. But, every now and then, his powers of description fail him, and he unintentionally confirms that, sometimes, a thousand words isn't worth a single picture. In his section on the development of the world's ophiolites, for example, he dares (and fails) to tackle what no geology textbook would describe without illustrations. During his travels, many of his academic companions remark on the importance of actually \\"doing\\" geology--of visiting the field and seeing it for oneself, but McPhee practices his own form of \\"black box\\" geology by describing, but never showing (with the exception of a few relief maps), what it is he's talking about. Another, secondary, source of frustration is McPhee's inclination to pose as nonjudgmental recorder, rarely evaluating his material or synthesizing it into a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Overall, however, \\"Annals' is probably the best book of \\"popular\\" geology one can read--certainly the best without illustrations. Its strengths overpower its faults and the best portions of the book are perceptively witty and unforgettably informative. You'll probably never drive by a roadcut again without pausing to take note of the strata.describe without illustrations.

The book, a true page-turner, is at its best when depicting the town's claustrophobic fear and the ease with which its inhabitants become self-centered and turn on each other (including an unexpectedly gruesome end for Anna's alcoholic father and a harrowing scene in which one of the neighbors is accused of witchcraft).<br /><br />Brooks clearly means to offer us the town of Eyam as a microcosm of late Renaissance England, as well as \\"a distant mirror\\" of our own society. It's the latter aspect that can be, at times, jarring. Both Anna and Michael are 20th-century personalities trapped in 17th-century bodies. Anna, conveniently, has learned to read and write and her outlook on life is anachronistically progressive; she and the minister's wife even serve as the town's unofficial medical scientists. And, in spite of a chauvinistic about-face in the last scene, the rector preaches a very modern gospel indeed. There is very little \\"fire and brimstone\\" and far more along the lines of this sentiment conveyed to an adulterer: \\"Who made our lusts, our low ways and our high? Did not God? Is not He the author of it all? The appetites we have all come from Him; they have been with us since Eden. If we slip and fall, He understands our weakness.\\"<br /><br />Brooks' depiction of Eyam is of a village with a far more diverse sample of English society than any small rural town actually would have had, and the thoughts and deeds of its heroes are beyond the reach of its post-medieval pastoral setting. Instead of historical fiction, \\"Year of Wonders\\" is best described as a modern-day parable with historical elements: a soap-opera thriller with a message for our own times rather than a true-to-life novel in the tradition of \\"The Name of the Rose.\\"have had, and the thoughts and deeds of its heroes are beyond the reach of its post-medieval pastoral setting.

His presence in the scarcely populated backwoods of Wisconsin perplexes his neighbors if they think about it much, but Wallace's Dorian Gray syndrome has become a fixture of their limited social landscape.<br /><br />Instead of hiding a painting in the attic or making a pact with the devil, however, Wallace had been chosen, a century earlier, as the keeper of an intergalactic way station. His nineteenth-century home is now an impenetrable rest stop for extraterrestrial travelers of an untold number of alien species; inside, time's arrow slows to a halt. Although Earth is optimally located for this pit-stop, its human inhabitants are not ready--psychologically or sociologically--for membership in the Galactic confederation. And so the station, and Wallace's role in it, are kept secret--until a CIA agent turns up and starts nosing around.<br /><br />As he does in his masterpiece, \\"City,\\" Simak adopts a campfire storytelling style that is suited to the rural setting. Although there's still plenty of action (and violence, for that matter), his pastoral musings are a refreshing change from many of the rockets-and-robots stories of the period. Similarly, his sympathetic portrayal of Lucy Fisher, a neighbor girl who endures physical abuse from her father, is affecting and unexpected. (There's also a fascinating description of a virtual reality shooting gallery that is forty years ahead of its time.)<br /><br />There are a few bizarrely off-key moments, though, such as when various earthlings encounter, with extraordinary equanimity, an alien being for the first time. And Simak does have a tendency to go a little overboard on his Cold War homilies (not to mention their grammatical gymnastics): \\"Somewhere, he thought, on the long backtrack of history, the human race has accepted an insanity for a principle and had persisted in it until today that insanity-turned-principle stood ready to wipe out, if not the race itself, at least all of those things, both material and immaterial, that had been fashioned as symbols of humanity through many hard-won centuries.\\"<br /><br />But \\"Way Station\\" compensates for these false notes and Sunday-school sermons with a riveting story, intriguing characters, and a somewhat sentimental ending that leaves nothing that might be mistaken for a loose end. At the close of this extraordinary adventure, Wallace realizes that the world as he knew it \\"would never be the same again\\" but that \\"he had work to do.

Between 1930 (when Hammett finished \\"The Glass Key,\\" perhaps his bleakest work) and 1933 (when he published \\"The Thin Man,\\" his last novel), Hammett had discovered two things that transformed his outlook on life: a steady income from book sales and from Hollywood filmwriting and, perhaps more important, Lillian Hellman.<br /><br />There's surely nothing like being unexpectedly wealthy and suddenly in love: Hammett's changed outlook on life is even more apparent when one compares the 65-page outline of \\"The Thin Man\\" he set aside in 1931 with the final version of his book, which seems to be more of a light-hearted and satirical tribute to the traditional whodunit than a continuation of the gloomy noir of his earlier novels.<br /><br />While his first four novels, as well as the early draft, featured an anti-Establishment loner (the Continental Op, Sam Spade, Ned Beaumont), \\"The Thin Man\\" introduces Nick and Nora Charles as a pair of unlikely crime-busters breaking off their vacation in New York (which consists mostly of drinking at any available venue) to solve a murder. Readers with only a passing knowledge of Hammett's biography will recognize both Hammett and Hellman as the inspirations for the alcoholic ex-sleuth and his socially savvy wife.<br /><br />What also separates \\"The Thin Man\\" from Hammett's other full-length works is its giddy humor, which revolves around seedy nightlife, early-morning alcohol consumption, and Nick and Nora's freethinking rapport, while the dialogue pokes fun at the tough-guy image and the mystery form itself. The morning after being grazed by a bullet, Nora asks Nick: \\"How do you feel?\\" \\"Terrible, I must've gone to bed sober.\\" This playful banter takes up much of the book and supplies one of its greatest pleasures.<br /><br />Many Hammett fans have long regarded \\"The Thin Man\\" as his weakest novel, and I tend to agree--up to a point. This book lacks the quality for which the others are famous: uniqueness (for lack of a better word). Although it's a sophisticated Manhattan comedy, Hammett's last detective novel is a lot like many other whodunits, and his unexpectedly relaxed and newly satisfied voice often doesn't ring true. Even so, it's a shining example of the traditional mystery and a lot of fun to read.famous: uniqueness (for lack of a better word).

US	41905526	R3BCN9W5A614FI	0670867543	620842671	Abraham Lincoln and the Road to Emancipation	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	A decent overview, despite the use of apocryphal quotes	In one of the most readable accounts available about Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War, Klingaman focuses on the Emancipation Proclamation and how Lincoln reached the decision to issue it. The author's thesis is twofold: that the Great Emancipator's primary goal was to save the Union from division and, as a result, that his decision to issue the proclamation, when he did, was based almost entirely on strategic and political factors rather than on moral grounds: \\"By emancipating the Confederacy's slaves as a war measure--and not as an act of justice toward the Negro--Lincoln subordinated the ideal of freedom to the preservation of the Union.\\"<br /><br />Klingaman's conclusion, of course, is hardly novel; most historians and general-interest writers (for example, James Baldwin) have always assumed as much. (This claim should not, however, be confused with the ongoing debate over whether the Civil War itself was caused primarily by the institution of slavery.) The author's aim here, then, is to moderate the popular image of Lincoln as a humanitarian saint while recognizing his worth as a stalwart, compassionate, and even apprehensive leader. A byproduct of Lincoln's wartime measure, emancipation was only the first (albeit significant) step in the struggle for equal rights in America: \\"Freedom would be won by the descendants of slaves, not bestowed upon them by whites.\\"<br /><br />The quibbles I have with the book are with the author's use of evidence. While Klingaman acknowledges in a bibliographical note that \\"a great deal of myth has become mixed with the fact\\" of Lincoln's life, he does little to sort the legend from the man. He indiscriminately blends Lincoln's words as recorded by such impeccably reliable sources as John Hay with writings by less dependable--and even suspect--observers, such as the portrait painter Francis Carpenter (who embarked on a career drawing from a seemingly inexhaustible supply of allegedly firsthand Lincoln sayings and tales).  In nearly every case, however, Klingaman presents secondhand sayings and speeches as if they were Lincoln's exact words, transcribed on the spot, even though many of these are embedded as paraphrased recollections in accounts recorded twenty or thirty years after Lincoln died.<br /><br />An additional sixty-odd quotes are taken from Dan and Virginia Fehrenbacher's \\"The Recollected Words of Abraham Lincoln,\\" which, as Klingaman notes, \\"attempts to gauge the reliability of several hundred contemporary witnesses who claim to have recorded Lincoln's words.\\" The Fehrenbachers rank the quotes from A (direct quotation recorded contemporaneously) to E (probably not authentic). Klingaman wisely avoids the least reliable quotes, but over half are direct and indirect paraphrases from months or years or decades later (which the Fehrenbachers have awarded a rank of C or D). These include a joke about interracial marriage attributed to Lincoln by a satirist known by the name of Petroleum V. Nasby, who was recalling the incident thirty years later; a speech allegedly delivered by Lincoln, recalled by Edward Stanly twenty years later in a report labeled by the Fehrenbachers as \\"self-serving, politically motivated, and chronologically erroneous\\"; a recollection by the minister Rudolph Schleiden (\\"it seems clear that Schleiden did not himself hear Lincoln speak these words,\\" according to the Fehrenbachers); and two excerpts from a lengthy monologue attributed to Lincoln by Gideon Welles that is \\"a combination of Lincoln core and Welles elaboration.\\"<br /><br />One cannot entirely fault Klingaman for using these various quotations in a popular account, since many of them are quite colorful and most of them may well be accurate in their essence. The problem is the lack of proper identification. In each one of the previous examples, Klingaman does not name the mouthpiece for these \\"sayings,\\" nor does he assess their reliability, nor does he even indicate, in the text or the notes, that these quotes are second- or third-hand (e.g., \\"Years later, Stanly claimed that Lincoln told him that...\\"). Surely, accurately represented quotations are essential in a biographical account concerning itself primarily with Lincoln's personal motives, intellectual growth, and political development.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book's portrayal of the events of the Civil War is largely accurate and, in spite of my serious reservations about the author's use of sources, even his characterization of Lincoln, in its broadest strokes, seems true to life. Although this volume will not satisfy those readers with a broad knowledge of Lincoln and the Civil War (and it should be approached cautiously by students), it's still a worthy introduction to the subject.es, that these quotes are second- or third-hand (e.g., \\"Years later, Stanly claimed that Lincoln told him that...\\").

Irving was only nineteen years old when he wrote these letters, and they were never reprinted in an authorized book form during his lifetime. (They are not included in his 1848 Author's Revised Edition.) The name of this collection, in fact, comes from an 1824 pirated edition, but it is the title by which these letters are now popularly known.<br /><br />Writing under the name of Jonathan Oldstyle, Irving poses as an elderly man who disparages the trendy \\"puppyism\\" on display among members of the younger generation: \\"our youths no longer aim at the character of pretty gentlemen; their greatest ambition is to be called lazy dogs--careless fellows--&c. &c.\\" In each letter, the fictional Oldstyle sneers at trends in fashion, conduct during courtship, behavior at the theater, and even the decline of manners during duels: \\"Our present customs I can't say I much admire--a twelve inch barrell [sic] pistol and ounce ball are blunt, unceremonious affairs, and prevent that display of grace and elegance allowed by the small sword; besides, there is something so awkward in having the muzzle of a pistol staring one full in the face.\\" As this passage makes clear, the real butt of Irving's wit is the older generation itself and its dandyish, ossified outlook.<br /><br />As one would expect from writing by someone approaching the end of his teen years, Irving's wit is occasionally sophomoric. But like high-caliber collegiate humor today, he also hits his targets with some well-aimed barbs. The descriptions of audience behavior watching low-brow entertainment in New York's Park Theater are particularly hilarious, with theatergoers dodging rotten fruit tossed from the balcony and wax dripping from the chandeliers. And some things haven't changed much, such as the author's complaint regarding \\"strumming and tuning\\" of the orchestra's instruments before the show: \\"though I admire the effect of contrast, I think they might as well play it in their cavern under the stage.\\"<br /><br />Both short and easy-to-read, the letters are a good introduction to the works of Irving for those who want to read beyond \\"Rip van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\" Although long out of print, except in scholarly editions, these comic pieces have been reprinted in the \\"History, Tales, and Sketches\\" volume of Irving's works published by The Library of America.umming and tuning\\" of the orchestra's instruments before the show: \\"though I admire the effect of contrast, I think they might as well play it in their cavern under the stage.\\" <br /> <br />Both short and easy-to-read, the letters are a good introduction to the works of Irving for those who want to read beyond \\"Rip van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\" Although long out of print, except in scholarly editions, these comic pieces have been reprinted in the \\"History, Tales, and Sketches\\" volume of Irving's works published by The Library of America.	2005-02-10

When Jane Vaughan, the chief curator, finally sees the painting mounted the night before the exhibit, she begins to think that something is not quite right. And therein lies a midsummer's nightmare for Auberon Booth, the museum's harried director.<br /><br />Waterfield is a former curator and gallery director himself, so his heroes and targets are certainly no surprise, nor is the frenzied finale all that unexpected. Yet, in spite of its predictability, there are laughs aplenty, and the mirth mushrooms as the plot progresses. Along the way, the author skewers scholars, high-society donors, picture restorers, art dealers, journalists, security guards, and even caterers (who provide the most over-the-top hilarity).<br /><br />But something is missing. As one of the scholars on the institution's board of directors argues, \\"The only thing that makes museums special is their collections,\\" and Waterfield's underlying message is that museums are, at heart, about art. Yet the art itself is mostly absent from this book. All we really learn about the mysterious \\"Lady St. John Impersonating Puck\\" is that it is a portrait of a noblewoman and a hound. Gainsborough's biography and artistic qualities and technique are beside the point; the painting could just as easily have been a missing Hogarth or Reynolds--or any other English artist. In the end, even in this clever and wicked satire, politics and commercialism overshadow the art itself.ent from this book.

While Baldwin's focus is on racial representation (and misrepresentation) in the cinema, he expands his comments to various national obsessions that are reflected on the screen. As with most of Baldwin's work, there is power and precision in every sentence--and he nearly always quotable.<br /><br />The essay is divided into three chapters. In the first, Baldwin discusses his adolescent love of movies and how it conflicted with his brief career as an adolescent minister in a church where the cinema (and the theater) were both regarded as \\"the devil's work\\" (thus, one of the implications of the title). The movies he dissects range from \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" to Fritz Lang's \\"You Only Live Once,\\" and he contrast the experience of film-watching with that of live theater, recalling Orson Welles's production of \\"Macbeth,\\" which featured an all-black cast.<br /><br />In the second chapter, Baldwin hits his stride, tearing into the patronizing portrayal of non-white roles in such films as \\"In the Heat of the Night,\\" \\"In This, Our Life,\\" \\"The Defiant Ones,\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" Baldwin observes about a type that reappears in many movies of the first seventy years of cinema: \\"It so happens that I saw 'The Birth of the Nation' and 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' on the same day . . . [Yet] in two films divided from each other by something like half a century, [there was] the same loyal [black] maid, playing the same role, and speaking the same lines.\\" Noting how this stereotypical woman never seems to have her own family and how her only concerns are those of her white masters or employers, Baldwin exclaims: \\"How many times have we seen her!  She is Dilsey, she is Mammy, in 'Gone with the Wind,' and in 'Imitation of Life,' and 'The Member of the Wedding.'\\"<br /><br />Baldwin's final chapter finds him perplexed by the popular films of the 1970s. He is disappointed by the watering down of Billie Holiday's autobiography in \\"Lady Sings the Blues,\\" although he admits that Diana Ross, Billy Dee Williams, and Richard Pryor \\"are, clearly, ready, willing, and able to stretch out and go a distance not permitted by the film.\\" And he is disturbed by \\"The Exorcist\\" and what it seems to suggest about American dogma: \\"The mindless and hysterical banality of evil presented in 'Exorcist' is the most terrifying thing about the film.\\"<br /><br />Or, as Baldwin responds elsewhere to such otherworldly screen depictions of virtue and immorality: \\"I have seen the devil, by day and by night, and have seen him in you and in me....

Jones's remarkable novel is its style of storytelling. Set in the fictional county of Manchester, Virginia, in the years immediately preceding the Civil War, the core of \\"The Known World\\" traces the plight of the thirty-three slaves belonging to Henry Townsend, a free black man who dies at the opening of the narrative, and his widow's attempt to keep together Henry's \\"legacy.\\" But this central plot is surrounded, punctuated, and jumbled by dozens of other stories, past and future, regarding Henry's former owner, his teacher, his neighbors, and his parents.<br /><br />Adopting a voice suggestive of Faulkner or Welty--but still uniquely his own--Jones sometimes sounds like an elderly man reminiscing about the old days while sitting on the porch--interrupting himself with scattered and random tangents, incapable of sticking to the main story but always fascinating his listeners. Often morsels from three or four different tales will be interwoven within the same paragraph. At other times, the author's phrasing recalls the cadence of the best Old Testament chronicles, especially the captivity narrative in the book of Exodus.<br /><br />And in still other places, Jones adopts the impassive tone of a modern-day historian, referring to wholly invented academic sources or commenting on the descendants of the book's characters decades later. \\"It was in the South that Anderson came upon material he would later put together in a new series of pamphlets he called Curiosities and Oddities about Our Southern Neighbors. . . . Only seven of those particular pamphlets survived until the late twentieth century. Five of them were in the Library of Congress in 1994. . .\\" (I confess: This passage fooled me into investigating whether or not such a series was ever written. Like other sources and documents referred to in the book, it's entirely the figment of the author's marvelously meticulous imagination.) Throughout, Jones's prose--whether bookish, mythical, or Southern colloquial--is pitch-perfect; not a word or expression wasted or out of place.<br /><br />Jones's Manchester County is populated by dozens of plantation owners, slaves, poor folk, freedmen, and children, and his writing animates each and every one of them. There are at least forty characters in his novel (and I didn't find it difficult to keep track of them), but the book's several interlaced stories focus especially on the (dead) Henry Townsend, his widow Caldonia, his overseer Moses, his father Augustus, the local sheriff John Skiffington, and William Robbins, the former owner of the Townsends who allows Augustus to purchase his family's liberty. That Henry blemished his own freedom by purchasing slaves is a source of profound sadness to his mother and father: \\"Why trouble ourselves with you bein free, Henry? You could not have hurt me more if you had cut off my arms and legs.\\" \\"I ain't done that any white man wouldn't do. I ain't broke no law.\\"<br /><br />Such passages highlight the moral bankruptcy that affected the judgments of everyone affected by slaveholding. Without minimizing the overwhelming destruction to the lives of African Americans, Jones recalls that even freedom, when granted to blacks, remained the whim of white men and, against the evidence of their own experiences, a few freed blacks sometimes fruitlessly and irrationally aspired to \\"be like white folk.\\" And the whites--both men and women, rich and poor--were themselves hardly worthy of emulation: morally compromised by their dehumanizing authority, sexually obsessed with their \\"property,\\" and ultimately unable even to enjoy or exploit the massive amounts of leisure time that slavery allowed them. (A theme that recurs in this book is the appalling immaturity and pampered slothfulness of slave-owners.) \\"The Known World\\" reminds us forcefully what we've known all along: that slavery poisoned everything and everyone it touched.ther bookish, mythical, or Southern colloquial--is pitch-perfect; not a word or expression wasted or out of place. <br /> <br />Jones's Manchester County is populated by dozens of plantation owners, slaves, poor folk, freedmen, and children, and his writing animates each and every one of them.

There is a reason for this ploy: while certainly a novel about growing old, \\"The Seven Sisters\\" is, above all, about a woman who is struggling, late in life, to find her voice.<br /><br />Candida Wilton is that woman, cast aside by her husband, who remarries after an affair, and even by her three daughters, who seem to side with their father. She moves from the pastoral neighborhoods of Suffolk to Ladbroke Grove, a squalid area of London, where she tries to make new friends, first by taking a class on Virgil at a dilapidated adult education school and then by joining the yuppified health club erected on the site after the school is shut down. She even manages to make the acquaintance of a few human specimens from the seedy \\"street theater\\" that both frightens and bemuses her during her strolls. And she spends much of her time recording thoughts on her journey through life onto her new laptop computer; it is the entries of this diary that comprise the book.<br /><br />The novel's first shift occurs when Candida reaps the benefits of an unexpected inheritance and decides to gather a group of \\"sisters,\\" both from her past and from her Virgil class, to accompany her on a tour retracing Aeneas's journey from Carthage to Naples. This voyage allows her to deliberate on the meaning of friendship, on her passive acceptance of whatever has life has thrown her way, and on the \\"irony ... that as we near death, there are fewer people left to be sorry, fewer left to miss us.\\"<br /><br />For many readers, Drabble's introspective musings will surely be dull and ponderous; the startling postmodern shifts will seem incongruous; and the melodramatic use of the inheritance might seem whimsical (most lonely women won't find self-esteem with the arrival of a windfall). But Drabble's prose is so unassuming and her character's mindset is so immediately familiar that I was fascinated, and there's just enough of a \\"plot\\" to keep this novel from becoming little more than a character study of a woman with not much character. Through the diary of Candida Wilton, Drabble conveys, as few authors can, the sensation of suddenly feeling old and alone.nely women won't find self-esteem with the arrival of a windfall).

The reader who isn't familiar with the first \\"Foundation,\\" with its extended prologue and four installments, will be at a loss. In the previous book, each chapter details a different interplanetary chess match between (on the one hand) the long-dead \\"psychohistorian\\" Hari Seldon, who had predicted the empire's demise and who initiated events that will accelerate the rise of a second empire, and (on the other) various individuals who struggle in vain to change the course of that inexorable future.<br /><br />\\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule,\\" the two episodes in this volume, will surprise the reader by departing from the pattern in the previous book. The first and shorter story is the lesser of the two; all the \\"action\\" occurs offstage, and the protagonists wait in suspense for a catastrophe that never really materializes. It's a bit of a letdown, but Asimov presents this incident to make a point: those who think they know when and where historical crises will next occur might miss out entirely on the real predicament at hand.<br /><br />The meat of the book will be found in \\"The Mule,\\" which is presented as a mystery of sorts (although I find it difficult to imagine the reader who won't discern the Mule's \\"secret\\" well before its unveiling). More successfully, this novella is an extended chase scene--it would make a great space adventure movie--in which the Mule's minions pursue our heroes through the far reaches of the universe. The unexpected appearance of a mutant species, represented by the Mule, throws into chaos Seldon's psychohistorical calculations--or does it?<br /><br />Asimov's prose style has always been a bane to language mavens, and the experimental qualities of \\"Foundation and Empire\\" serve to spotlight many of his most pervasive faults. Even by the loose standards of pulp fiction, these two stories suffer from more than their fair share of tautologies, pleonasms, comma splices, sentence fragments, and worse. (No chapter should open with a sentence like either of the following: \\"There was reason to the fact that the element known as 'pure science' was the freest form of life on the Foundation.\\" \\"The blockade was run successfully.\\")<br /><br />But Asimov's fans--myself included--don't turn to his novels for their literary qualities. Instead, we enjoy his ability to present a complicated story and tie up all the loose ends, to weave politics and philosophy and science into his fiction, and to make us think.tions--or does it?<br /><br />Asimov's prose style has always been a bane to language mavens, and the experimental qualities of \\"Foundation and Empire\\" serve to spotlight many of his most pervasive faults.

US	41905526	R1BMOGBLKTKE4C	1862072442	878779668	Remind Me Who I Am, Again	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A memoir of individual memory and family history	Linda Grant, a feature writer for the Guardian [UK], has written a memoir about memory, focusing both on the loss of her family's history as the older generations die off and the deterioration of her mother's mind due to Multi-Infarct Dementia [MID], which stifles short-term memory and gradually scrambles older recollections. The book is also a intensely personal struggle against the guilt and helplessness one feels when making the necessary decision to commit a loved one to an institution.<br /><br />Grant is descended from Jewish immigrants who arrived from Russian and Poland and settled in Britain and America before the Second World War. (Many of her family's relatives who remained behind were, of course, killed by the Nazis.) A somewhat rebellious daughter during the heady and reckless Sixties, she soon realizes that all those stories that used to bore her as a child will soon be lost forever: \\"My mother, the last of her generation, was losing her memory,\\" she mourns. \\"In a hundred years there will no one left alive who remembers her, who can tell you who she was.... Without the past we're nothing, we belong to nobody.\\" All that remain are a few scattered photographs and letters lacking any basic context and the occasional recollection that her mother summons up out of the blue and whose authenticity Grant can no longer verify.<br /><br />The second aspect of the book is the most moving--and the most laudable. Grant recounts the frustrations and the episodes that led her and her sister to intercede and commit their mother to a care center, and she describes the legal and bureaucratic obstacles that nearly prevented them from making this step. What makes this decision particularly difficult--and, to some strangers, hardhearted--is that her mother is capable of periods of perfect lucidity and social grace. Grant describes how, while her mother's domestic conditions and intellectual capacity deteriorated to the point where she became a danger to herself, she retained an acute awareness of how she appeared to others as well as \\"the basest, most acquisitive part of ourselves\\"--the urge to go shopping: \\"So we shop together, outside time, mother and daughter united each in our own purposeful quest to do what we have always done, and which to her goes on making sense.\\"<br /><br />What keeps this book from surrendering to guilt and self-pity is Grant's admirable sense of humor--some of her sketches are heart-achingly funny--as well as the research that lends its framework an aura of objectivity. \\"Remind Me Who I Am, Again\\" certainly provides comfort and advice to relatives of those with aging family members, but it is also a valuable read to anyone who cares about individual memory and family history.tained an acute awareness of how she appeared to others as well as \\"the basest, most acquisitive part of ourselves\\"--the urge to go shopping: \\"So we shop together, outside time, mother and daughter united each in our own purposeful quest to do what we have always done, and which to her goes on making sense.\\" <br /> <br />What keeps this book from surrendering to guilt and self-pity is Grant's admirable sense of humor--some of her sketches are heart-achingly funny--as well as the research that lends its framework an aura of objectivity. \\"Remind Me Who I Am, Again\\" certainly provides comfort and advice to relatives of those with aging family members, but it is also a valuable read to anyone who cares about individual memory and family history.	2005-01-16

It's his only novel with enough clues to allow readers to figure out who did it--although the identity of the killer will still surprise most readers (including this one, to be honest). What distinguishes it from a typical murder mystery, however, is Hammett's fastidious prose, scurrilous characters, noir ambience, and borderline misanthropy.<br /><br />Ned Beaumont, a self-described \\"amateur detective\\" with an independent streak and a gambling habit, is the loyal underling to shadowy political boss Paul Madvig, whose major concern is to see his candidate, Taylor Henry, reelected to the Senate. When the Senator's son is murdered alongside a dimly lit street, Madvig is the chief suspect, the papers (controlled by the opposition) go on the attack, and Beaumont intervenes with an attempt to clear his boss's name. While not above resorting to ethically dubious behavior, Beaumont retains a vein of rectitude under his tough-guy exterior, and he's even willing to undergo the most brutal thrashings at the hands of the criminal opposition out of loyalty to his own superiors--as long as they themselves don't cross the line.<br /><br />His fourth novel in three years (1929-1931), \\"The Glass Key\\" is bleaker and more cynical than its predecessors, and the mood spirals further downward as the story unfolds. (One can almost imagine Hammett's brooding temper darkening with each stiff drink.) While most of his fiction deals with the underworld and its corruption and squalidness, this work shows most effectively the seedy alliances among businessmen, political bosses, elected officials, law enforcement, media figures, and organized crime in Prohibition-era America.	2005-01-13

True, he is angrier, rawer, less forgiving here, and his earlier diplomatic hopefulness has given way to a deeply cynical and contemptuous view of American society. Yet, given the atrocities Baldwin, along with his friends and colleagues, personally witnessed and underwent during the years immediately preceding this book, his fury is, at the very least, understandable.<br /><br />Baldwin's recollections of the 1950s and 60s are not presented as linear narrative. Instead, he intertwines, among other topics: the cowardice of liberals during the McCarthy era; the French-Algerian conflict; his investigations and travels in the South; the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X (and his own reminiscences of them); his experiences in Hollywood with commercial filmmakers; his encounters with Eldridge Cleaver, Huey Newton and the Black Panthers; his bemused reaction to the flower children in San Francisco; and his four-year battle to rescue his former assistant, Tony Maynard, from an arrest and conviction for a murder he didn't commit. (Maynard's conviction was overturned after this book was published.) The supporting cast of his friends and adversaries in these personal and societal struggles is a veritable who's who: Elia Kazan, William Styron, Fred Shuttlewsorth, Andrew Young, Harry Belafonte, Billy Dee Williams, Marlon Brando, Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />Baldwin's self-effacing willingness to reopen old wounds and expose the evidence of his own folly is still on hand here. He opens with an anecdote about a visit with a childhood friend in the south Bronx: his humorous and humiliating arrival in a limousine, the all-too-apparent difference between his own prosperity and his friend's meager (but contented) subsistence and his shameful condescension toward his friend's \\"job at the post office,\\" and their explosive argument over the war in Vietnam. He also recounts his own naivety in a chronicle of his first traumatic exposure to Jim Crow laws in Montgomery: \\"It is not difficult to be a marked man in the South--all you have to do, in fact, is to go there.\\"<br /><br />Baldwin admits to the impossibility of objectivity in his writing, comparing his task to Shaw's writing \\"Saint Joan\\": \\"he had the immense advantage of having never known her.\\" And his account of two decades of struggle is by no means impartial. But I prefer this version of Baldwin, who no longer seems to care about kowtowing to the mostly white New Yorker readers who made up his audience for his earlier work. \\"No Name in the Street\\" is uncomfortably honest--and that bluntness lends the work a faithfulness to the spirit of the times.m.

(Sturgeon's insistence on incorporating different races and both sexes as equal partners living together as a new evolutionary species was, in 1953, years ahead of its time.)<br /><br />This history of this team--the newly evolved Gestalt species--is recounted in three extraordinarily different stories. Even the prose style varies: the opening section has the feel of a Gothic horror story combined with a Jack London tale; the middle is written entirely as teasing banter between a new member of the Gestalt squad and his shrink; and the final chapter could be a Depression-era tale by Steinbeck (or, more precisely, an episode of HBO's \\"Carnivale\\").<br /><br />The book's shortcoming--and it's not insignificant--is Sturgeon's tendency to hammer home the import of his stories. Each of the three endings abandons subtleness and representation for bluntness and pontification; it sometimes seems that the author presents each resolution in the same manner he would reveal a mathematical proof. Thus (and I'll phrase my criticisms without exposing the book's secrets), the group of misfits discerns how they can work together as a team; thus, the team learns how they are a cohesive whole; thus, the totality endeavors to develop their own morality. Nothing is left for the reader to interpret or even to imagine.<br /><br />In spite of its overly meticulous endings, \\"More Than Human\\" has much to say about human society and ethics.

It's tempting to be churlishly inappropriate and quip that this book should finish her off. \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" is no easier to get through, but the patient reader will soon appreciate that it expands the mind more than it hurts the brain.<br /><br />Greene's purpose is an overlapping twofold: explain what exactly makes up space and time and present how scientific progress seems to be heading closer to a unified theory of everything. As to this latter point: even if we have a theory of everything we admittedly won't know all that much. Instead, a unified theory is more accurately described as a successful reconciliation of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, a resolution that is currently the holy grail of scientists and Nobel committees.<br /><br />Those folks who make a habit of reading general science books won't find much new here, although Greene's chapter explaining branes and braneworlds is the clearest and most accessible I've read on the subject. What Greene has going for him, though, is a great sense of humor and an innate ability to transform the most complex theory into a cute (and sometimes, perhaps, too cute) story. Even more important, Greene is willing to share both his excitement for his discipline (string theory) and his \\"gut feelings\\" about what scientists are likely to discover going forward, an enthusiasm that conveys both the turmoil of discovery and the mutability of science.<br /><br />The one major disappointment is the book's illustrations. Part of this is not Greene's fault: the ink prints too heavily on the uncoated stock used by the publisher, and some of the before-and-after renderings are barely indistinguishable. Many illustrations are printed too small. Others don't adequately portray the events they are supposed to demonstrate. Since his text relies on the presentation of these drawings and photographs, it's too bad that it's so hard to make some of them out.<br /><br />Nobody will mistake Greene's book for a page-turning thriller; it's best if one digests one chapter at a sitting and allows time for rereading some of the more complicated ideas. Our microcosmic fabric of our universe is plenty weird enough to provide material for 500 pages of exploration and discovery, and it's impossible to come away from this book thinking of space or time--or life--in the same way.d that it's so hard to make some of them out.

US	41905526	RT06EXZCZR5RY	0395957893	474809806	Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton	Books	4	7	8	N	N	An impressive biography that overcomes scanty documentation	Diane Middlebrook has been blessed with such a fascinating subject for this biography that it would be a poor writer indeed who sapped the story of its interest. Yet the author faces a daunting challenge because so little documentary evidence remains concerning the life of Dorothy/Billy Tipton, especially for the early years. Fortunately, Middlebrook is up to the task, and where she can't provide content she supplies invaluable context for the life of a locally famous jazz singer now known less for his musical talent than for a closeted, transgendered (and, I would argue, brave) life.<br /><br />Between her birth in Oklahoma and his arrival in Spokane, Tipton somehow made the transformation from an eccentric saxophone- and piano-playing young woman to a married husband, father, bandleader, and talent agent. In the absence of any firsthand information from Tipton himself, Middlebrook has to rely on a scattered selection of photographs, a handful of letters, and on interviews with the few people still alive who knew Dorothy in Oklahoma and the many who knew Billy in Spokane. She concludes, correctly I think, that Tipton initially became a male impersonator primarily to get a job in the male-dominated jazz circuit and eventually grew so comfortable in the role that what may have begun as a career choice gradually became a social choice. Tipton's lesbianism surely contributed to the self-assured ease with which she made this transformation.<br /><br />For the early years of Tipton's life, Middlebrook doesn't have a lot to go on, and I was wary when reading that she had \\"to substitute imagination for the absent documentation.\\" Yet in the pages that follow this statement, the author doesn't depart far from reality: over half of the material describes Tipton's hometown through the eyes of others and a good chunk is directly quoted source material. Even when the record is vague about Dorothy Tipton herself, the reader gets a feel for the small-town culture that she undoubtedly experienced and for the Depression-era jazz clubs in which Tipton surely performed.<br /><br />Middlebrook likewise speculates that Tipton's fear of exposure nixed his band's big break during the 1950s, which would have included recording contracts and the opportunity to open in Nevada casinos for such star performers as Liberace (an irony of a different sort). Tipton's double life was well-known in Oklahoma, and his success as a father and businessman certainly hinged on keeping his profile within the confines of the Northwest. The author also fills in the gaps in our knowledge of Tipton's life with tangents that are mesmerizing on their own, such as the story of Alberta Lucille Hart, another Spokane resident who became radiologist and novelist Alan L. Hart during the first half of the twentieth century.<br /><br />It's impossible not to finish this book with a sense of appreciation for Tipton's daring. Tipton's first triumph, of course, is the amazing ability to pull it off. But, even more impressive, he managed to do so and leave behind him an astonishing number of people of all ages and backgrounds--wives, adopted sons, in-laws, and show business colleagues--who clearly loved and admired him and who, although stunned by the posthumous revelation that he was biologically a woman, continue to think of him fondly.ubtedly experienced and for the Depression-era jazz clubs in which Tipton surely performed. <br /> <br />Middlebrook likewise speculates that Tipton's fear of exposure nixed his band's big break during the 1950s, which would have included recording contracts and the opportunity to open in Nevada casinos for such star performers as Liberace (an irony of a different sort).

Although relatively brief, it unfolds like a frontier epic, and reading it now, it's hard to believe that Cather, living in Greenwich Village at the time, doubted whether anyone would be interested in the story of struggling Nebraskan farmers. As she wrote to a friend, with \\"this one I hit the home pasture and found that I was Yance Sorgeson [a rich farmer] and not Henry James.\\"<br /><br />\\"O Pioneers,\\" for all its understated countrified charm, is not without the ingredients of a  torrid drama: familial dispute, an adulterous affair, a double murder. The novel began its life as two stories, which Cather brilliantly melded into an ambitious whole. The first features Alexandra Bergson, who assumes proprietorship of her family's farm when her father dies, leaving her with three brothers. After several lean years, she nurtures the family estate, holding on to the land when many of her neighbors give up and return East. To insure the prosperity of her three siblings, Alexandra sacrifices her own comforts and passions--but never her independence. Yet the two older brothers first respect and then resent Alexandra's astute management--and they especially begrudge the favoritism she shows to their college-educated younger brother, Emil, whom she indulges with the goal of advancing him in the world beyond.<br /><br />The second narrative concerns Emil and Marie Tovesky, who are childhood friends whose companionship flowers into romance after Marie marries the ornery, bitter, and somewhat mad Frank Shabata. If Alexandra's story provides the novel with its atmosphere and theme, the Emil-Marie story supplies the action and tension. Intermingled with these two storylines are depictions of rustic events and folksy characters (especially memorable is Ivar, a shaggy-haired, barefooted, back-to-nature eccentric).<br /><br />Even a century later, \\"O Pioneers!\\" packs a wallop. But, more powerfully, it's an ode to the early settlers and to their struggle to survive. \\"The land belongs to the future,\\" Alexandra remarks at the end. \\"We come and go, but the land is always there.\\"tury later, \\"O Pioneers!\\" packs a wallop.

As Stephen Kinzer concludes in in his animated history--which reads like an espionage thriller--\\"few would deny that the 1953 coup in Iran set off a series of unintended consequences.\\"<br /><br />Why would the United States topple a regime that not only considered us an ally but also emulated our own form of government? The quick, but incomplete, answer is also the obvious one: oil. Certainly that's the only reason the British needed when Mohammad Mossadegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The fading imperialists of the British government predictably screamed foul, arguing that the allegedly \\"private\\" oil company had a long-term agreement, signed in 1933, and Mossadegh had no right to renege on that agreement. As Kinzer's mountain of evidence shows, however, the Brits had conveniently ignored their own half of the deal: they had steadfastly refused to implement promised wage increases, build better housing, and construct hospitals and schools for the nearly enslaved and wholly impoverished native workers. Furthermore, London refused repeatedly to open the company's books to Iranian inspection,  appropriated more than its contractual share of the profits, and supplemented the take by disguising large portions of the earnings as a corporate tax.<br /><br />The Truman administration, wisely, would have nothing to do with British whining, but Churchill, inevitably, found two kindred spirits in the newly elected Eisenhower administration: Secretary of State John Dulles and intelligence director Allen Dulles. British oil wasn't enough bait for the Americans, but London knew that there was something that would make the Dulles brothers sit up and pay attention: the Red menace. British plans were thwarted, however, by an inconvenience: Mossadegh and his officials were not in the least interested in Communism and regarded the Soviets with undisguised contempt. So, instead, American ambassador Loy Henderson and British ambassador George Middleton invented the Communist canard in an unassailable if specious guise, arguing that Mossadegh's government was unstable and that it might someday fall to extreme leftists; \\"the longer Mossadegh remained in power, the likelier it was that Iran would fall to communism.\\" In other words, the British convinced the Americans to meddle to prevent the off-chance that the Soviet Union might decide to meddle first (never mind the fact that the Soviets were then reeling from Stalin's death and were in no position to do anything of the sort).<br /><br />This brief background summary doesn't evoke even a small part of the story, and Kinzer's book unveils many surprises that should frustrate and dismay Americans who believe that our government should be an ally to friendly democracies. The planning and execution of the coup (there were two attempts--the first one failed) that brought the tyrannical Shah back to power often resembles an episode of the Keystone Cops, but Mossadegh's trust and honor was no match for Western persistence and duplicity.<br /><br />Kinzer's concluding chapter (as implied in his subtitle) goes too far, however, when he asserts that this shameful episode of American history is responsible in large part for Middle East terror. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the repressive Saudi monarchy, the Soviet-Afghan war, the rise of the Taliban (which was hardly friendly with the current Iranian regime)--these and many other factors have contributed to the region's turmoil. Still, it's irrefutable that our betrayal of Mossadegh insured that Middle East leaders and peoples would, in the future, be justifiably wary of ever again trusting us.<br /><br />There are expatriates from the Shah's era who argue that his regime, while undeniably authoritarian, was better for Iran than what followed it and that the United States was correct in championing him. This weak attempt to tar Mossadegh's reputation by implicitly aligning him with the fundamentalists ignores the fact that Khomeini & Co. were also vocal enemies of the Mossadegh administration. By replacing a good (if imperfect) government--by getting involved at all--the United States insured that lingering resentment for our role in the first tyranny would be used against us by the leaders of the second tyranny--even if they despised Mossadegh himself. And, finally, it ignores the possibility that, if we had instead supported and encouraged Mossadegh and minded our own business, the Middle East might well be a friendlier and more peaceful place today.deniably authoritarian, was better for Iran than what followed it and that the United States was correct in championing him.

He collected these two essays in this small volume, and it's considered (along with \\"Notes of a Native Son\\") his best work. His biting, heartfelt analysis on race relations flings its barbs equally at the legacy of American white supremacy and the duplicity of liberal white guilt; although it was written more than forty years ago, it reminds us both how far we've come and how far we have yet to go.<br /><br />Baldwin frames his observations around two thematically related biographical episodes: his brief three-year stint as an adolescent Pentecostal preacher in Harlem in the early 1940s and his journalistic visit to the headquarter of the Nation of Islam in Chicago's South Side twenty years later. Both institutions, Baldwin finds, suffer from an ambivalent myopia: Christianity in general \\"helped to protect and sanctify the power that was so ruthlessly being used by people who were indeed seeking a city, but not one in the heavens, and one to be made, very definitely, by captive hands\\"; the Nation of Islam \\"inculcated in the demoralized Negro population a truer and more individual sense of its own worth\\" through the \\"fearful paradox\\" of creating a hopeful future with \\"an invented past.\\" Blacks, he seems to say, have traded in the belief system forced on them by their oppressors to a understandable longing for an illusory past. His conclusion is aggressive but perceptive: \\"the Negro has been formed by this nation, for better or for worse, and does not belong to any other--not to Africa, and certainly not to Islam.\\"<br /><br />But that's only half the story--or certainly less than half. Baldwin has far more to say about this nation's white majority; the underlying subject is the predicament of \\" 'the so-called American Negro,' who remains trapped, disinherited, and despised in a nation that has kept him bondage for nearly four hundred years and is still unable to recognized him as human being.\\" Baldwin correctly posits that, historically, the usual recourse by an oppressed group in such desperate circumstances has been violent upheaval. Throughout history--white history--it is incontrovertible that \\"violence and heroism have been made synonymous,\\" from the Norman Invasion to the American Revolution. And, indeed, in such a nation as ours, \\"there is no reason that black men should be expected to be more patient, more forbearing, more farseeing than white; indeed, quite the contrary.\\"<br /><br />Despite the historical legacy and Baldwin's dire warnings of the potential for bloodshed, Baldwin nevertheless remains cautiously hopeful for the future, and he predicted--correctly, notwithstanding church bombings and assassinations and riots--that integration and civil rights victories and black advancement might be achieved with relatively little violence, certainly when compared to the horrors other revolutions have engendered. For one thing, blacks had--and have--an advantage: they understand, all too well, white Americans, while the reverse is not--and has never been--true: \\"Ask any Negro what he knows about the white people with whom he works. And then ask the white people with whom he works what they know about him.\\"<br /><br />For another, American black history has, if anything, been testimony \\"to nothing less then the perpetual achievement of the impossible.\\" Only by acknowledging the past and confronting the future Americans can \\"achieve our country, and change the history of the world.\\"bondage for nearly four hundred years and is still unable to recognized him as human being.\\" Baldwin correctly posits that, historically, the usual recourse by an oppressed group in such desperate circumstances has been violent upheaval.

US	41905526	R1MU3C4HG6N5JN	1582431310	543422373	Natural Selection: A Novel	Books	3	2	2	N	N	The meaningless malaise of middle-age angst	Books about white male mid-life crisis are so plentiful that they are nearly a genre unto themselves. In \\"Natural Selection,\\" Barthelme applies his minimalist style to yet another entry in this genus: the story of the 40-year-old, once-divorced, twice-married husband and father Peter Wexler. This 1990 novel, if it is read by future generations at all, will probably be remembered for its unexpectedly shocking and seemingly senseless ending, but it is--intentionally or not--mostly a deeply cynical satire of the media-manufactured epidemic of middle-age malaise.<br /><br />Wexler, who without really trying or caring has become successful at a meaningless job he despises in a public relations firm, has a wonderful wife and an understanding son, but he's deeply unhappy with the world. His anger and depression is unfocused but it's usually set off by little things: \\"a guy at the office for lying, or somebody on TV for a specious argument, or a politician for unscrupulous ads, or a magazine article riddled with manipulative distortions.\\" After failing to keep his promise to his wife and son to stop complaining so much, he moves into separate quarters, with both comic and tragic consequences.<br /><br />On the one hand, Barthelme's prose works best with Wexler's interior monologues, in which the wayward suburbanite tries to shake himself of his day-to-day angst. Wexler knows he loves his wife and his son in spite of the tedium of his existence but can't help but wonder if that's all there is to life. On the other hand, the dialogue is a plastic patois, a parody of middle-class speech that fails to give the remaining characters in the novel any substance and lends a sense of unreality to the conversations that dominate the book. Put simply: nobody talks like that. (Wexler son, in particular, speaks like a nine-year-old Tucker Carlson, sans bowtie.)<br /><br />As parody, this banter sometimes works, but the overall effect is to render the book's explosive finale nearly meaningless. In Barthelme's manipulative hands, Wexler realizes too late the obvious moral of this story: he's been valuing and enjoying the wrong things in life; the cup has always seemed half empty when it has, in fact, been nearly full. But one can almost smell the smug tone of Barthelme's writing (you want something to whine about, I'll give you something to whine about), and the reader, who has never seen the cast of the supporting characters as much more than satirical sounding boards for Wexler's imagined psychoses, is left emotionally stranded alongside a Houston highway when Wexler finally learns his lesson.nipulative hands, Wexler realizes too late the obvious moral of this story: he's been valuing and enjoying the wrong things in life; the cup has always seemed half empty when it has, in fact, been nearly full.

US	41905526	RHBWXW48ZXVVX	0679767924	236199661	Independent People	Books	5	10	11	N	N	The saga of a stubborn, oafish, loveable "independent man"	What an amazing, overlooked, unexpected treat this book turned out to be. Halldor Laxness (who won the Nobel Prize in 1955) has performed the impossible: he's written a multi-generational saga centered about Bjartur of Summerhouses, a stubborn, foolish, often detestable curmudgeon, and he has somehow transformed this unlikely hero into a thoroughly likeable oaf. The result is nothing short of a miracle, both comic and tragic--and never predictable.<br /><br />In his introduction to this edition, Brad Leithauser reports on his meeting with the author in Iceland in 1986, when he tells Laxness, then an octogenarian, how much he admired Bjartur. Laxness responded, \\"Oh, but he's so stupid!\\" Leithauser's reply: \\"Oh, but he's so wonderfully stupid!\\" Exactly. Bjartur is an uneducated sheep rancher who has spent 18 years in servitude with one simple goal: to own his own land and live as an \\"independent man.\\" His philosophy is derived entirely from Icelandic sagas he memorized as a child; his politics are based wholly on the principle of sovereignty; his social skills are those of a loner.<br /><br />The resulting adventures are both hilariously mortifying and tragically doltish: within his first year, he is lost in a blizzard searching for a sheep that he believes has gone missing but that his malnourished wife has surreptitiously slaughtered and eaten. He returns to find his wife dead after giving birth to a daughter who is still barely alive. All that and more occurs in the first 100 pages, and to tell you much more is too give too much away. (Indeed, Leithauser's excellent introduction divulges too much of the plot and should be saved for the end.)<br /><br />Although Bjartur eventually remarries and raises sons, the story henceforth centers around the unlikely and uneasy bonding between father and daughter. In addition, Laxness weaves in the social and political changes transforming the country and victimizing any rancher who is caught up on the wrong side of the divide, which swings between capitalist financiers and cooperative societies. World War I brings untold wealth to the inhabitants of neutral Iceland, so \\"that the passion for building was exceeding the bounds of good sense, and that many children were returning home from school both hurriedly educated and over-educated.\\" Mutton and wool were suddenly all the rage and \\"peasant culture had suddenly become the great gospel\\" of the national authorities. All this is too much for the simple-headed Bjartur, whose blind devotion to pastoral traditions and to hermitic self-sufficiency works against him as often as it works in his favor.<br /><br />The translation by J. A. Thompson is startlingly fluent; it's often hard to believe that Laxness didn't write this book in English. Considering how funny, sad, heartwarming, trenchant, and topical this satirical epic is, even in translation, it's inexplicable that Laxness isn't better known--and it's incontrovertible that \\"Independent People\\" is a masterpiece of twentieth-century fiction.capitalist financiers and cooperative societies.

He famously proved his worth as a Dickensian writer in \\"A Fine Balance\\"; in \\"Family Matters\\" he adopts a far more claustrophobic setting to portray a family torn apart and then strengthened by both poverty in a big city and proximity in close quarters.<br /><br />Nariman Vakeel, an elderly Parsi deteriorating from Parkinson's disease, breaks his ankle, and the injury is the last straw for his two stepchildren, who have tired of caring for him. The pair (quite literarily) unload Nariman on his daughter Roxana and son-in-law Yezad, along with their two sons, all of whom live in a tiny two-room apartment. The addition of Nariman to this impoverished household taxes the newly enlarged family beyond its means, and the strain caused to both their patience and their limited budget forces various members of this previously honorable family to consider schemes and deceptions to make ends meet.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Nariman's stepchildren plot increasingly outrageous acts of subterfuge to prevent his eventual return to his own home. And we eventually discover the details of the old man's past relationship with a Goan Christian woman, the tragic and scandalous consequences of which his stepchildren--especially his stepdaughter Coomy--continue to hold against him.<br /><br />As in his past books, Mistry relies in part on coincidence to advance the story, but he is adept at never subsuming the family drama to his plot devices. (He even offers a coy response to those who don't believe in the prevalence of happenstance, when Yezad realizes after one tragedy, \\"That was the problem, everyone dismissing the possibility of coincidence.\\") But this book is less about chance and more about the inevitable fate of the victims of a city, like Bombay, that is overwhelmed by corruption and callousness and deprivation.<br /><br />If this book is guilty of excess, it is in its characterization of Coomy. It's not that her wickedness is implausible--far from it. Rather, Mistry never convincingly presents the motives for the greed and selfishness that cause her to go to the lengths she does to keep Nariman from returning to the apartment she has managed to commandeer from him. More generally, we're never quite sure why she resorts to malice while her brother hesitates in cooperating in her schemes.<br /><br />But, in the end, \\"Family Matters\\" is not about Coomy and her brother but about Roxanna and Yezad and their two sons. The troubles that plague their household are all too believable, and Mistry's novel forcefully and affectionately describes one family's decline, partial redemption, and ultimate defiance against the inhumanity of fate and circumstance.r />If this book is guilty of excess, it is in its characterization of Coomy.

The troubles that plague their household are all too believable, and Mistry's novel forcefully and affectionately describes one family's decline, partial redemption, and ultimate defiance against the inhumanity of fate and circumstance.	2004-12-16

This independence lends Spade a confidence and an arrogance that distinguishes him from Hammett's other protagonists, and this autonomy is underscored in the first few pages when the firm of Spade & Archer becomes the firm of Samuel Spade--and when he then avoids Archer's widow in part because the dead man's surviving \\"partners\\" had been having an affair.<br /><br />But Spade meets his match in the book's \\"femme fatale\\": his client Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She draws the detective into a sordid and shady scheme that involves three of the least savory and most comical underworld figures one will encounter in fiction: the fey Joel Cairo, the kid Wilmer Cook, and the \\"Fat Man\\" Casper Gutman. Further exacerbating Spade's attempts to solve the mystery of who killed his partner are the city police, whose ham-fisted meddling and asinine suspicions continually get in the way of Spade's pursuit of revenge and the desire to clear his name.<br /><br />\\"The Maltese Falcon\\" is not simply a whodunit; Hammett, unlike Christie or Macdonald, is concerned less with the placing of clues and the unveiling of secrets and more with the battle of wits between Spade and the woman who has hired him. But, for the reader, it's still filled with surprises, and it's nearly impossible to say more about this book without giving too much away. When I recently read it a second time, I found myself in awe more of the characterizations and the atmosphere than of the page-turning plot--but I still envy those readers who have before them the joy of opening this book for the first time.	2004-12-11

Pohl's first entry in the Heechee series is really two books in one: a space adventure about pioneers exploring the universe and a tongue-in-cheek look at artificial intelligence through a Freudian prism.<br /><br />\\"Gateway\\" alternates between two storylines. Robinette (Bob) Broadhead, a young man drudging away in an underground food mine on Earth, wins a lottery and uses his earnings to travel to Gateway, a portal that was constructed and abandoned by an unknown species and that contains hundreds of modules which transport voyagers to predetermined locations throughout the universe. Adventurers are paid immense royalties by the Gateway Corporation for any scientific discoveries and for booty, but there are two hitches: nobody has ever been able to figure out in advance the destination for each module and a rather significant proportion of the explorers either return dead or are never seen again.<br /><br />Pohl ably depicts the claustrophobia of the Gateway colony and of space travel, and he convincingly imagines the fear and excitement that precedes each journey. Once our hero arrives at Gateway, however, he finds himself thwarted far more by his fear of dying than motivated by the desire for glory and fortune; after his training he proves a reluctant pioneer. The accurate and realistic portrayal of this inertia is simultaneously one of the novel's strengths and its downside, since the reader all but experiences Bob's indolence while he gets up enough nerve to set out on a trip: \\"Most days we simply spent deferring decisions.\\" Living and working in space can be quite tedious.<br /><br />Between Bob's recollections of his life in Gateway are transcripts of his conversations, years later, with Sigfrid, a computer/robot who serves as his A.I. shrink. We soon realize that Bob was the only survivor of one of his exploratory missions, and Sigfrid teases out Bob's feelings of guilt while we concurrently learn the details of his past. At its best, these conversations are vaguely reminiscent of Stanislaw Lem's psychological fiction (although nowhere near as cerebral), and Pohl's idiosyncratic sense of humor make many of these sessions fun reading.<br /><br />These two \\"before and after\\" strands twist and twine their cords to an ending that wraps up all the loose ends, explains the mystery of the doomed expedition, and satisfactorily connects both stories. (Perhaps too satisfactorily: the final bit of dialogue between Bob and Sigfrid almost has the feel of a punch line of a shaggy-dog tale written for psychotherapists.) Pohl's wit and his knack for realism ultimately carry the story of these daring--if suicidally inclined--fortune-hunters to other worlds.ns are vaguely reminiscent of Stanislaw Lem's psychological fiction (although nowhere near as cerebral), and Pohl's idiosyncratic sense of humor make many of these sessions fun reading. <br /> <br />These two \\"before and after\\" strands twist and twine their cords to an ending that wraps up all the loose ends, explains the mystery of the doomed expedition, and satisfactorily connects both stories.

US	41905526	R36Z4KY6GZZC1P	0766185168	35840208	Tales of a Traveler	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Surprisingly amusing tales of ghost, pirates, and bandits	\\"Tales of a Traveller\\" is certainly not as well known as Irving's \\"Sketch Book\\" (which includes his famous stories \\"Rip van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\"). When it was originally published in 1824, it was heavily criticized as both derivative and indecent. The criticism was so intense that Irving abandoned the writing of fiction and wrote history, biography, and folklore for the remainder of his career.<br /><br />Yet, two centuries later, the stories have dated well. I'll return to whether the stories can be considered offensive, but modern readers' lack of familiarity with the sources that Irving apparently copied makes the accusation of imitation somewhat moot. In addition to being remarkably readable (and they are certainly never boring), many of the stories seem fresh and even modern.<br /><br />The collection is divided into four parts: the first, \\"Strange Stories by a Nervous Gentleman,\\" is a group of ghost stories (many of them notable for their lack of \\"real\\" ghosts). Irving uses the framing technique of a friend relating an overnight stay in an old mansion with a group of gentlemen trapped by a storm. They tell each other ghost stories, and in some of these the characters themselves tell tales (stories within stories within stories). The second section, \\"Buckthorne and His Friends,\\" includes humorous anecdotes about the backgrounds of a group of eccentric authors attending a dinner. \\"The Italian Banditti\\" features stories of the highway robbers who afflict travelers in Italy; this section reads almost like a romantic Western novel. And, finally, \\"The Money Diggers\\" claims to be the long-lost papers of Diedrich Knickerbocker (Irving's fictional author of \\"A History of New York\\"); these spirited yarns of pirates and buried treasure set in and around the island of Manhattan are pure entertainment.<br /><br />There are a number of surprising nuggets here: too many, in fact, to single them out. Although modern readers will find it difficult to see what's offensive about this collection (some readers were apparently insulted by Irving's portrayal of Englishmen, for example), there's one rather scandalous and delightfully creepy ghost story, \\"The Adventure of the German Student,\\" that deserves special comment. Without giving too much away, let's just say that it can only be read as a story about necrophilia and goes further than anything even Poe ever wrote.<br /><br />It's difficult to find this book in an inexpensive standalone volume, but it is available in a relatively affordable edition (which also includes \\"Bracebridge Hall\\" and \\"The Alhambra\\") published by The Library of America.see what's offensive about this collection (some readers were apparently insulted by Irving's portrayal of Englishmen, for example), there's one rather scandalous and delightfully creepy ghost story, \\"The Adventure of the German Student,\\" that deserves special comment.

US	41905526	R3MEUJIJAJBI6G	0803264038	26098786	The Troll Garden: Short Stories	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Cather's early stories, including four later revised	Cather's first book of fiction gathers seven stories, four of which were initially published in magazines and later revised for inclusion in the 1920 eight-story collection \\"Youth and the Bright Medusa\\" (which is worth reading on its own). Collectively, the stories in \\"The Troll Garden\\" show the young Cather in the throes of an overtly Jamesian phase, with perfunctory nods to her later rural and Nebraskan subjects. While all are united by the theme of artistic genius and influence, none are about the artists themselves. Instead, they relate the dreams and delusions of the relatives, friends, hangers-on, and wannabes who associate with artists and either idolize or scorn them.<br /><br />The two most well-known stories are \\"The Sculptor's Funeral\\" and \\"Paul's Case,\\" both of which were left largely unchanged for their later versions and in Cather's 1937 edition of collected works. The first describes rural neighbors who vent their lack of appreciation for the achievements of an internationally famous sculptor when his corpse is shipped to his hometown for burial; \\"Where the old man made his mistake was in sending the boy East to school\\" is the verdict of one of the town's inhabitants. \\"Paul's Case\\" concerns a school-age boy whose flightiness and irresponsibility is exacerbated by the fanciful extravagances represented on the stage and by the glittering allure of celebrity lifestyle.<br /><br />Both \\"\\"A Death in the Desert\\" and \\"A Wagner Matinee\\" were heavily revised for their later publications. The first of these, filled with literary allusions and oddly detached from its Wyoming setting, benefited from the later changes, which tightened both the prose and the emotional impact. Its heroine is an opera singer dying of tuberculosis who recalls a lost love--a brilliant composer--in the unexpected appearance of his younger brother, whose own career never escapes the shadow of his sibling's renown. The 1905 version of \\"A Wagner Matinee,\\" in contrast, is far superior to its later incarnations, in which Cather had softened beyond recognition her portrait of a Bostonian woman transplanted to Nebraska who returns back East after thirty years of relentless drudgery. Although Cather's family regarded the story as a mocking and insulting caricature of her own aunt, the earlier depiction's bite and its leanness are what make it so powerful.<br /><br />The three stories that appear exclusively in this collection are \\"Flavia and Her Artists,\\" \\"The Marriage of Phaedra,\\" and \\"The Garden Lodge.\\" The first of these is the best; it concerns a society matron playing hostess to a gaggle of artists who take advantage of her hospitality but who can barely tolerate her pretensions. The story turns when a member of the company broadcasts his scorn for Flavia in a withering profile published by a local newspaper.<br /><br />Many of these pieces, in sum, should be read not simply for insights into the early development of a celebrated author; they are near-masterpieces in their own right. In them one can see a uniquely constructed literary bridge between the Eurocentrism of Henry James and the American realism of Sinclair Lewis.o its later incarnations, in which Cather had softened beyond recognition her portrait of a Bostonian woman transplanted to Nebraska who returns back East after thirty years of relentless drudgery.

Originally published in national magazines between 1954 and 1961, these essays are more mature, if less biting, than his first collection--and they are certainly just as witty. With one notable exception, they are timeless and trenchant commentaries on racial and cultural issues.<br /><br />The first group of eight essays focuses on the political and social divides in the United States. The opening article reiterates the discovery he made in \\"Notes of a Native Son\\": that by living in Europe he paradoxically discovered what it means to be an American. Others examine the despicable inhumanity of a Harlem public housing project (\\"cheerless as a prison\\"), the success of the student movement and the rise of Muslim power in black politics (\\"a very small echo of the black discontent now abroad in the world\\"), and the first efforts to integrate Southern public schools (\\"the entire nation has spent a hundred years avoiding the question of the place of the black man in it\\"). The two most memorable essays detail the daily bravery, trauma, and humiliations of a schoolboy who is the first black in an all-white school and respond to Faulkner's despicable remarks on race (which were made when Faulkner was seemingly drunk and which were later repudiated when he was atypically sober).<br /><br />The only disappointing essay is \\"Princes and Power,\\" an account of Le Congres des Ecrivains et Artistes Noirs (Conference of Negro-African Writers and Artists). The internal disputes and lofty goals of this gathering--convened to consider \\"the history of Euro-African relations\\" and the postcolonial \\"cultural inventory\\"--did not lack for interest, and Baldwin ably relates the tensions between and cross-purposes of American blacks and Africans. But, overall, he seems to be just phoning it in, muffling the obvious passions of the conference participants and highlighting instead the abstract academic tone.<br /><br />The second and final group of five essays highlight cultural subjects. He follows a speech detailing the outline for an imaginary novel with biographical appraisals of Andre Gide, Ingmar Bergman, Richard Wright, and Normal Mailer. His eulogy for Wright, initially composed and published in three disparate parts, simultaneously expresses regret for Baldwin's youthful criticism of the older author that resulted in the irreparable destruction of their friendship and recounts Wright's sad social decline: \\"he had managed to estrange himself from almost all of the younger American Negro writers in Paris ... [who] had discovered that Richard did not really know much about the present dimensions and complexity of the Negro problem here, and, profoundly, did not want to know.\\"<br /><br />But the gem of the collection is \\"The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy,\\" Baldwin's tongue-in-cheek account of his friendship with Normal Mailer, written both as not-so-subtle payback for Mailer's criticism of Baldwin in the self-indulgent \\"Advertisements for Myself\\" and as a tribute to Mailer's talent and \\"responsibility\\" as an artist. After sending off a number of barbed (yet good-natured) repartees, Baldwin acknowledges not only Mailer's importance as a \\"very good friend\\" but also his worth as a writer. Baldwin's assessment of that career serves at as fitting coda to Baldwin's own essays: \\"His work, after all, is all that will be left when the newspapers are yellowed, all the gossip columnists silenced, and all the cocktail parties over, and when Norman and you and I are dead.\\"abstract academic tone.

US	41905526	RD48L2CP1I59S	0060541644	59964273	A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide	Books	4	31	33	N	Y	The costs of "doing nothing" in an era of genocide	Power's award-winning, critically acclaimed doorstop of a book is a must-read for anyone concerned about the rise of international authoritarianism, ethnic retribution, and genocidal atrocities and about the world's apparent inability to stop such occurrences. It's not a comprehensive history of twentieth-century genocide; instead, Power includes a series of case studies, focusing on Cambodia, Iraq, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, along with brief capsule summaries of the 1917 Armenian genocide and the Holocaust.<br /><br />She opens the book with a history of the word \\"genocide\\" and its recognition as an international crime. The hero of this part of her story is Raphael Lemkin, who coined the word, formulated its legal definition, and badgered the United Nations to adopt the 1948 Genocide Convention (which, sadly, the United States refused to ratify until 1986--and then only to save face after Reagan's embarrassment at Bitburg).<br /><br />She then moves to her gut-wrenching examples, showing how (except in the case of Kosovo) each followed a nearly predictable trajectory, with a complacent and cowardly world community standing by in denial. Still, she spotlights heroic actions by a few, including William Proxmire, whose 3,211 Senate speeches over 19 years failed to shame his colleagues into passing the Genocide Convention; Peter Galbraith, a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member who struggled to publicize Hussein's gassing of the Kurds; and Robert Dole and Madeleine Albright, whose combined fury forced the Clinton administration to confront the nightmares in Bosnia and Kosovo. Her accounts of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are especially lucid for those of us whose heads spin with confusion whenever we hear mention of the Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian-Herzegovinian-Slovenian-Macedonian conflicts.<br /><br />Because Power's stories are so distressing and her goal is so laudable, the sympathetic reader is all the more frustrated by the book's faults, of which there are several. While emotionalism and outrage can be commendable (and understandable, given the inconceivable number of innocent victims whenever the world fails to respond to genocidal atrocities), her pronunciations sometimes betray her zeal. The resulting indignation can often result in Monday-morning quarterbacking and moral condescension, either of which might simply alienate those readers who aren't convinced that the United States has the wherewithal to be the world's policeman. Granted, Power is right to condemn U.S. officials for doing nearly nothing, especially in the case of Rwanda, but she often assumes that what, in retrospect, we should have done is what, at the time, we could have done. (Surely we must do something, but it doesn't follow that anything will do.)<br /><br />Likewise, she claims that the United States has \\"done nothing, practically or politically, to prepare itself to respond to genocide,\\" and she bases this statement--and several like it--mostly on the assumption that, before Kosovo, this country has never prevented genocide. Such statements are easy to assert (since genocide has certainly occurred) but impossible to rebut (since it's difficult to claim genocide was prevented in those situations when it didn't happen at all).<br /><br />Second, she maintains that, given the world's dysfunctional international and regional organizations, the United States must assume the role of white knight. She bridles at suggestions by opponents of unilateral intervention that our status as a superpower will always make our motives suspect or that American ground troops are not as capable of both imposing regional order and handling multiple crises as she seems to believe. (Perhaps our adventures in Iraq have made her reconsider this pollyannaish militarism.) She is unimpeachably correct that our country must act when signs portending genocide are detected, but certainly we must hesitate before we ever do it alone.<br /><br />A model of successful non-military intervention, for example, is East Timor. Although Power gives a two-sentence mention to the 1975 genocide, she doesn't point out that the United States took the lead in preventing a repeat occurrence in 1999--without committing a single American troop. After an initial hesitation, the U.S. coordinated a multilateral response against Indonesia with members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, support from China, and troops from Australia. (See Michael Hirsch's \\"At War With Ourselves\\" for an excellent summary of this unheralded diplomatic coup.) Such a regionally concocted solution might work as well in other--but certainly not all--situations.<br /><br />Finally, and most seriously, Power is quick to condemn governments and government officials, but (except for an anecdote in the Introduction), she neglects entirely to chastise her colleagues and employers in the media. She repeatedly asserts that political leaders can convince the public to disregard any initial qualms about humanitarian intervention, but she never acknowledges that it is difficult to do so in an environment where journalists and editors entirely ignore (for example) the current horror in Sudan and prefer instead to plaster the Scott Peterson trial across the front page and cover sports-team brawls during every news-hour.<br /><br />If these criticisms sound disproportionately harsh, it is simply because I am holding Power (and her colleagues in the media) to the same high standards she posits for our elected leaders. My caveats should in no way minimize the importance of her work; instead, \\"A Problem from Hell\\" is so successful in large part because it motivates readers to face such unforgivable horrors and to consider how best to prevent them./>A model of successful non-military intervention, for example, is East Timor.

Schlesinger first provides a concise overview of how American policy has changed from nineteenth-century isolationism to Wilson's abortive multilateralism through Roosevelt and Truman's success in preparing Americans for a larger world role. He confirms that the United States has always insisted on its right to \\"preemptive\\" war but insists that the new Bush Doctrine is more accurately called \\"preventive\\" war, which \\"refers to potential, future, therefore speculative threats.\\" Schlesinger then revisits the thesis he introduced in \\"The Imperial Presidency,\\" and finds that the most recent executive actions have taken on a new look; \\"the American Presidency has come to see itself in messianic terms as the appointed savior of a world whose unpredictable dangers call for rapid and incessant deployment of men, arms, and decisions behind a wall of secrecy.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the book's title, its second half is concerned with matters other than war and broader than the American presidency: the instability caused by the electoral college (he proposes a solution), the future of democracy itself (his verdict is optimistic), and the \\"use\\" of history in determining future events. On this last issue, he marshals an array of arguments against the self-defeating prophecies of Marxism and concludes, persuasively, that history is a \\"negative\\" model: \\"It instructs us not, like Marxism, in the things we must do, but in the things we must not do--unless we wish to repeat the mistakes of our ancestors.\\"<br /><br />Schlesinger's reinforces his political observations with historical anecdotes, trenchant quotes, and a solid grounding in American jurisprudence. A certain old-fashioned quality pervades his opinions, and usually this traditionalism is admirable. I take issue only with his predisposition against the \\"electronic town hall\\"; he claims in an aside that the \\"Internet has done little thus far to foster the reasoned exchanges that in Madison's words 'refine and enlarge the public views.'\\" One senses that Schlesinger is judging the Internet secondhand by its excesses (on both right and left) rather than by intimate knowledge of the online political community. If anything--regardless of the outcome of any single election and in spite of the blogs that promote rumor over reality--the Internet has, in a remarkably short time, increased citizen participation in and knowledge of politics. Indeed, it is the traditional news media, with its penchant for entertainment and oversimplification, that has failed us.<br /><br />Yet this quibble is negligible, and this short little book does much to put our current crises in perspective, reminding us that history \\"supplies an antidote to every generation's illusion that its own problems are uniquely oppressive.\\"nce.

Each of its three parts is a crime story unto itself, unveiling the convoluted pasts of a couple who die in the first act and of their oddly dull-witted daughter.<br /><br />The always-unnamed Continental Op arrives on the scene to investigate the disappearance of eight imperfect diamonds from the home of Edgar Leggett, a soon-dead scientist who was trying to develop a method for tinting the jewels. This section is the most traditional of the three--a rather formulaic detective story where many of the whodunits seem to be solved by the end.<br /><br />But it's the unsolved (and incorrectly solved) aspects of the mystery that provide the fuel for the next two parts. After the Op moves on to another case, he is called back to protect the Leggetts' daughter, Gabrielle, who is holed up--and doped up--with a religious cult. The Op stays in the Temple of the Holy Grail and observes both its strangely lethargic inhabitants and the charmingly plastic husband-and-wife team who leads the cult; his odyssey is one of the more atmospheric and bizarre adventures in Hammett's oeuvre. These four chapters alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />From there, the action moves to the beachfront town of Quesada, where Gabrielle and her new husband have secreted themselves to recover from the prior series of traumatic events. The twists and turns--and the climax--are satisfying indeed, but what's lacking throughout the novel becomes apparent at last: Hammett's bizarre ambiance and the plot surprises fail to compensate for cardboard characterizations that aren't quite believable.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"The Dain Curse\\" is a brisk page-turner, and fans of crime novels and of Hammett in particular are sure to enjoy the ride.	2004-11-24

Adopting the aloof tone and narrative style of medieval saga, Le Guin tells the story of young Sparrowhawk (whose \\"secret\\" inner name is Ged) and the adventures he encounters and calamities he unleashes while he studies to become a wizard. In spite of its sparseness, this first entry in the series is rich in theme and characterization, especially in the presentation of Ged's inner struggle.<br /><br />The plot is simple: a precocious lad in the northern area of the archipelago of Earthsea shows promise in the art of magic. Taken under the wing of a local mage, Sparrowhawk soon bridles under his tutor's deliberate, methodical training, and he is sent on the long voyage to an island that hosts a school for wizards. The competitive nature among schoolboys, however, prods Sparrowhawk to unleash a fearful monstrosity (his own dark side, so to speak) and the young wizard spends the remainder of his young adulthood atoning for--and trying to correct--his rash mistake. Although his early mentor Ogion and fellow-student Vetch both have important roles to play in Ged's salvation, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" focuses almost exclusively on Ged's lonely quest, and it is at heart a psychological tale featuring a single heroic character.<br /><br />Initially written for teens (and marketed as such), the Earthsea books have transcended the \\"young adult\\" market--and deservedly so, since the author tackles so many themes in so few pages. One aspect in particular that has received much comment is its ecological message. Throughout their schooling, the young wizards are warned against the \\"butterfly effect\\" of their powers. \\"You must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. The world is in balance, in Equilibrium.\\" Evil in Earthsea is the destruction of the world's equilibrium, and a wizard's duty is, above all, to maintain that environmental balance.<br /><br />Le Guin's tales are sure to receive renewed attention because of the Earthsea miniseries on the Sci-Fi. So it's too bad that Le Guin herself has denounced the film version as \\"a far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned.\\" Perhaps Le Guin will someday meet the filmmaker she deserves.ium.\\" Evil in Earthsea is the destruction of the world's equilibrium, and a wizard's duty is, above all, to maintain that environmental balance.

In spite of its modern themes and transcontinental setting, its graphic descriptions and shocking plot twists, Hosseini's debut novel is remarkably old-fashioned storytelling: a page-turner and a tearjerker all wrapped up in a series of cliffhangers. I tend to shy away from such books, but this tale is never so manipulative as to be treacly, and his protagonists are so winsome that they are impossible not to admire even when they frustrate our expectations.<br /><br />Amir is the son of a privileged Afghani and his best friend, Hassan, is the son of their servant. Living in the peaceful prosperity before the Afghan-Russian war, the relationship between the two boys is lopsided: Hassan worships Amir and would do anything for him \\"a thousand times over,\\" but Amir benefits from Hassan's camaraderie while exploiting his naivety and denigrating his Hazaran ethnic background. The pair compete together in the city's kite-flying competitions, but Amir otherwise shies away from Hassan's presence in public settings. When Hassan is victimized in an appalling act of street violence, Amir fails to come to his rescue, a failure that will haunt him the rest of his life, all the way to California, where he and his father escape the chaos of their country's wars.<br /><br />Amir's other relationship of note is with his father, Baba. Judicious and stern, Baba seems larger than life to Amir, while Amir consistently fails to live up to his father's ideal. (Baba is particularly perturbed by his son's lack of athleticism and his longing to become a writer.) Yet, their escape from Afghanistan and residence in the United State dethrones Baba, and Amir learns to balance his father's expectations and his own aspirations.<br /><br />The book's only false note is Amir's nemesis, Assef. As the person responsible for brutalizing Hassan, Assef grows up (rather predictably) to become a Taliban executioner. But, unfortunately, the author tends to pile on: Yassef not only is a violent hoodlum as a youth and a masochistic leader as an adult, he also idolizes Hitler and the Nazis, and he is an aggressive pedophile whose not-so-private displays of lechery are, if anything, so excessive as to be unbelievable. The result is pure, nearly farcical stereotype. Yet, although the coincidence that throws Amir and Assef together again seems wrenched out of a bad Dickens plot, their final showdown and Yassef's over-the-top portrayal have the unexpected benefit of distracting the reader from the book's two other surprises (and, of course, I won't spoil anything here).<br /><br />Sounds a little sentimental and melodramatic? Well, yes. But the strengths of this book are its individual characterizations, its cross-cultural representations, and (above all) its humanity.

That is the comic premise of \\"Morte D'Urban,\\" which portrays the priests of a fictional order in the Midwest who are challenged by a man of the cloth via Madison Avenue: a priest who pays as much attention to public relations and material wealth as he does to the spiritual good of his Catholic flock.<br /><br />Father Urban is the go-getter with high hopes for his order. A popular preacher--the type of priest with whom you can have a beer (or something stronger)--Urban is on the constant lookout for potential donors and is quite willing to overlook a little vice among his flock in exchange for higher congregational participation and the greater financial good of his organization. The problem, however, is that the Clementine headquarters in Chicago and its Father Provincial share one intractable quality: bureaucratic inertia. Urban's grand plans to secure his order's economic well-being, increase its visibility, and transform its old-fashioned torpor to a flashier modernity are stymied by his fellow priests' contentedness with their lowly standing.<br /><br />For his efforts, Urban is soon sent packing to the Protestant backwaters of Minnesota, to a decrepit retreat house run by a penny-pinching and somewhat incompetent rector. Making the most of a bad situation, Urban applies his charm to the local Catholic population, to a new group of potential donors, and, eventually, to the refurbishment of the retreat itself, including the addition of a nine-hole golf course. As his goals become grander, however, his transgressions and indulgences multiply, and the result is a series of hilarious episodes that teach Urban that being a faithful Catholic and being an American materialist, more often than not, are difficult to reconcile.<br /><br />Powers's humor takes many forms: dry wit, social satire, situation comedy, and even slapstick. The result is a brilliant morality tale describing the daily challenges that a 2000-year-old religious institution faces in a 200-year-old secular nation. \\"Morte D'Urban\\" is a loving portrait of Catholics and Americans and of the unintentional comedy created by those who try, in good faith, to be both.many forms: dry wit, social satire, situation comedy, and even slapstick.

Mahasamatman (\\"Sam\\") is resurrected from the ether by the artificer Yama, whose technical skills at reincarnating the human form is unsurpassed among the inhabitants of this alien planet. Yama, with help from the goddess Ratri and from Tak (who is currently banished to the form of an ape), have recalled Sam from eternal peace to help them confront several gods who struggle for control of the world.<br /><br />From this opening, the books shifts to a series of tales, in flashback form, recounting Sam's past and explaining the history of the battles among the gods. Although these divine rulers share the names and personae of the Hindu pantheon, it soon becomes apparent that the \\"gods\\" are simply the original colonists who came from Earth millennia earlier, who keep the planet's present occupants in a sort of medieval fiefdom, and who have acquired immortality by transmigrating from body to body. But there is an ongoing struggle in \\"heaven\\" between the Accelerationists (led by Sam), who want to share technology with the rest of mankind, and the Deicrats, those gods who want to maintain their lives of luxury and oppression.<br /><br />Many of the earlier chapters are told in the form of disjointed legends, but halfway into the book the pace evolves into a continuous storyline. Those readers who argue that \\"Lord of Light\\" belongs to the fantasy genre more than to science fiction have a point: beyond the futuristic technology practiced by the \\"gods\\" (which is more of a sideshow than a major plot element), the novel's prose style, structure, characters, and action resemble what you'd find in many a medieval saga. (One surprising aspect, however, that distinguishes these tales from many fantasy novels is the often sarcastic and occasionally slapstick humor.) Because of its kings-and-swords plot, Zelazny's work recalls epics like \\"Dune\\" or dystopian/political works like \\"The Dispossessed\\" rather than \\"hard\\" sci-fi.<br /><br />As for the novel's much-hyped Hindu aspects, I think David Brin (a great admirer of this book) says it best: \\"For all of the clearly genuine empathy he finds in other cultures and conveys so well in his works, Roger Zelazny is as western as they come.... He'd be kicked out of the ashram for asking too many questions.\\" This is no primer on Hinduism; in spite of the author's fascination with Eastern mysticism, it's no coincidence that religion is presented both as a means of enlightenment and as a form of oppression. Instead, Hinduism serves as a vehicle for a futuristic parable of all-too-human foibles.recalls epics like \\"Dune\\" or dystopian/political works like \\"The Dispossessed\\" rather than \\"hard\\" sci-fi.

He also includes interpretative summaries of the four main entries.<br /><br />Brook Thomas's \\"The Education of an American Classic: The Survival of Failure\\" uses the Harvard Classics (compiled by Charles W. Eliot, who hired Adams as a professor) as a means to assess the place in the canon of both Adams's work and his \\"rhetoric of failure.\\" Framing this discussion within the academic dispute over content versus method, Thomas argues, \\"The importance of the 'Education' is not merely its capacity to raise questions but its challenge to face questions that we--like Adams before us--have inherited from the past.\\"<br /><br />Martha Banta's essay, \\"Being a 'Begonia' in a Man's World,\\" looks at Adams's life and work from a feminist perspective. She tackles this neglected aspect from two fronts, looking at Adams's often sexist yet primitively empathetic views of women and analyzing his defensiveness of his own manliness (or, more accurately, his lack thereof). As a self-described \\"butterfly\\" and \\"dilettante\\" and as a blueblood member of the leisure class, Adams is excluded from the company of \\"real\\" men--those in the \\"process of gaining money rather than having it. Adams knew what money meant in defining American manhood.\\" Banta sometimes lapses into the literally obvious (\\"Because Adams was genetically a male, with a male's rights in society\\") or the metaphorically ridiculous (\\"By means of 'internalization' and 'appropriation' of the kind that suggest the tribal ritual of cannibalism\\"), but her essay is the most original and provocative (and surprisingly witty) of the bunch.<br /><br />The volume concludes with two essays that I'd wished I had before I read \\"The Education.\\" Rowe's \\"Henry Adams's Education in the Age of Imperialism\\" dissects the complexities of Adams' friendship with Secretary of State John Hay and of the \\"decidedly neoimperialist\\" policies Hay advanced during the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations. He argues that, far from being a simple observer, \\"Adams was an active participant in the crucial diplomatic negotiations . . . from the end of the Spanish-American War and the annexation of the Philippines to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.\\"<br /><br />In what is arguably the collection's best essay (\\"The Education and the Salvation of History\\"), Howard Horwitz examines Adams's work in light of contemporary intellectual debates--from New History to social Darwinism--and describes it as a meditation \\"on the nature of history and the office of the historian.\\" For instance, Adams's autobiography \\"secures the benefits of the great-man theory of history even as it eschews the benefits of the great-man theory of history.\\" Horwitz is especially adept at tackling and resolving the many perplexing contradictions Adams serves up to his readers.<br /><br />Although written by literary critics, these essays wallow comfortably and competently in the historical foundations of \\"The Education of Henry Adams.\\" (Only a thorough examination of Civil War diplomacy is missing.)

In addition to \\"Siege\\" (released posthumously by the Military Book Club and finally available in paperback), he published two collections of short stories and the nonfiction \\"Gotterdammerung 1945: German's Last Stand in the East.\\"<br /><br />\\"Siege\\" is a bracing exception to the formulaic ardor that often plagues the genre of \\"military fiction\\": its captivating story erases the reader's knowledge of the historical outcome; the reluctant yet resolute soldiers are hardly superhuman; the writing manages to be both evocative and lyrical; and the author empathizes with the misery endured by the troops--without ever sympathizing with the German effort itself.<br /><br />Even the prologue hints at the uniqueness of this work. Emaciated and wretched Russian prisoners are released from the Siberian Gulag, corralled into cattle cars, and shipped to the front, where they are chained to the inside walls of bunkers, handed guns, and forced to face the German onslaught. After this brief representation of the despair and terror of Stalin's human fodder, the perspective shifts to the German side for the remainder of the novel. Yet the vileness of the opening scene is so searing that most readers won't forget that, for the men forced to fight on the Eastern front, the brutality and senselessness of both sides are indistinguishable.<br /><br />The majority of \\"Siege\\" is based on real events. In January 1942, Russian forces surrounded, trapped, and outnumbered troops under the command of Generalmajor Theodor Scherer--over 5,000 men--in the town of Cholm, where they held out for 105 days during one of the harshest winters on record. Six months later, Scherer found himself frustrated by another siege, in nearby Velikiye Luki, but this time he was on the outside, separated from the remainder of his forces.<br /><br />While Schneider depicts Scherer as a benign if overburdened leader, the novel's nucleus comprises three fictional characters. The insolent Kordts and the garrulous teenager Freitag are the only men ensnared in both sieges. Freitag is the type of youngster who is liked, and protected, by everyone; the pair's odd friendship provides a shield for Kordts, whose coolness is viewed with suspicion by his superiors and fellow soldiers alike. During the second siege, the two men encounter Sergeant Schrader, who is drawn toward their magnetism, and Schrader's partiality for Freitag increases when his own companion is wounded and when Freitag himself is separated from Kordts. \\"Siege\\" is, above all, a tale about the resilience of friendship amidst great peril.<br /><br />In the minds of all three men, both sieges take place, appropriately, in a geographical, political, and historical vacuum. For the most part, the troops in the trenches rarely knew what was happening in the world at large, and most German and Russian soldiers had little sense of the events that pushed them to slaughter each other. True--Hitler makes a cameo appearance, and the Holocaust is mentioned obliquely when Kordts encounters a group of SS officers sent to the front, but these token scenes seem obligatory rather than intrinsic to the story.<br /><br />Because Schneider didn't live to see his work published, the prose occasionally has an unpolished taint--but it's never enough to overcome the brilliance of the work as a whole. Furthermore, a map and a short glossary would have been thoughtful additions, since the Russo-German front is alien territory even for those with a background in World War II history. Nevertheless, because the setting is so claustrophobic--taking place almost entirely within the confines of two small towns--readers who don't usually peruse military fiction should be able to follow the action without recourse to a reference shelf.<br /><br />With historical accuracy, compassionate characterization, and (above all) a page-turning finale, \\"Siege\\" portrays the unthinkable limits of human endurance amidst the horrors of war.n endurance amidst the horrors of war.	2004-11-05
US	41905526	R34FLCFQZYNW7Z	188296828X	531214602	City	Books	5	120	122	N	N	It's a dog's world	Thousands of years in the future, the canine population of planet Earth, along with their robot helpers, sit around campfires and tell each other controversial fables about how they owe their ascendance to an extinct and perhaps mythical species of benevolent, if misguided, humans. This bleak, melancholy portrayal of humanity's prospects for survival is unusual, then, not only for its dystopian vision but also for its often pastoral storytelling.<br /><br />Originally published during the 1940s as a series in Astounding Science Fiction, these eight stories were gathered into a novel in 1952. For the book, Simak made a few revisions and added a framework of \\"textual commentaries,\\" featuring remarks from canine critics who debate both the meaning of the tales and the likelihood that humankind ever even existed. The stories themselves focus on the role of the (human) Webster family, whose descendants during the course of thousands of years influence the future of humans, dogs, robots, and even ants. The only character common to all the tales is a robot named Jenkins, who serves first human, then canine masters as various threats present themselves over the course of numerous millennia.<br /><br />The first three tales describe a deteriorating human society that retreats from urban blight and escapes to remote family outposts, relying almost entirely on robots for supplying the labor and on the wired world for communication and supplies. (Simak's prescient vision of the Internet is one of the most hauntingly accurate prophecies in this book.) As a result, many of the earth's inhabitants suffer from agoraphobia--a combination of simple lethargy and a fear of leaving their homes--and this isolation is amplified in the form of nearly immortal human mutants that live entirely on their own, \\"disdaining all the artificiality of society.\\"<br /><br />The most memorable (and most original) pair of tales portrays a few humans who venture outside their homes to other worlds and who inadvertently discover a form of nirvana by assuming the genetic makeup of a mysterious, gas-based life-form on Jupiter. Humanity is thus confronted by a choice: either perpetuation of their own species or the allure of paradise under a different guise.<br /><br />Simak's initially relaxed pace soon surrenders to a more riveting style, especially because the later stories are more interrelated (both by common characters and by plot devices) than the first three almost-standalone tales. The book's underlying hopelessness, which often flirts with a subtle misanthropy, is hard to explain, however; there's no real apocalypse. Instead of doom or destruction, the future of humanity according to Simak is a world of isolation and loneliness, and perhaps that's the most depressing vision of all.r a form of nirvana by assuming the genetic makeup of a mysterious, gas-based life-form on Jupiter.

They are among the most compelling, insightful pieces ever written on what it means to be an American and, in particular, what means to be a black American. \\"The story of the Negro in America is the story of America,\\" Baldwin writes, \\"or, more precisely, it is the story of Americans. It is not a pretty story: the story of a people is never very pretty.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everybody's Protest Novel\\" and \\"Many Thousands Gone\\" both discuss the portrayal of blacks in American fiction (beginning with \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\") and contain harsh criticism of Richard Wright's \\"Native Son\\"--comments which permanently ended their tempestuous friendship. Baldwin next directs his ire (and wit) at the ridiculous stereotypes in the all-black film \\"Carmen Jones.\\" These are not mere reviews, however; the strength of these three essays is Baldwin's ability to offer general comments about societal matters based on a few examples. The second essay is particularly noteworthy because Baldwin writes as if he, like most of his readers, were white. This technique allow him to imply that, on the one hand, as a native-born American, he can easily comprehend the view of the \\"dominant\\" culture, yet, on the other hand, the black experience is something white Americans will never understand--that the majority assumption is \\"that the black man, to become truly human and acceptable, must first become like us.\\"<br /><br />The next three essays offer social commentary. \\"The Harlem Ghetto\\" describes life in Baldwin's neighborhood, examines the importance of the Negro press, and (undoubtedly with the readers of Commentary in mind) focuses especially on the ongoing tensions between Jews and blacks. In \\"Journey to Atlanta,\\" Baldwin tells how his brother's church quartet was sent by the Progressive Party to Atlanta, ostensibly to sing at church events, but inevitably as free labor for canvassing activities--with no pay, poor lodging, and substandard food. In the end, the four young men were left to fend for themselves, struggling to earn money for their tickets back to New York. The final essay, \\"Notes of a Native Son,\\" is a poignant eulogy for Baldwin's stepfather, including a hair-raising account of Baldwin's near-suicidal attempt to rebel again Jim Crow rules in New Jersey.<br /><br />Baldwin's life in Europe takes up the last section. The first three essays describe the \\"social limbo\\" that greets Americans--white and black--in Paris and the \\"invisibility\\" of American blacks there; it includes the horrifying account of Baldwin's arrest and imprisonment for a hotel bedsheet stolen by an acquaintance. The final essay ends the collection on a humorous, sometimes touching, and ultimately contemplative note: what it's like to be not simply the only black man living in a Swiss resort but the only black man most of the villagers have ever seen. Baldwin realizes that \\"no road whatever will lead Americans back to the simplicity of this European village where white men still have the luxury of looking at me as a stranger.\\"<br /><br />What's astonishing about these essays is the balance between Baldwin's justified rage and his ability to laugh at the world--and at himself. Many of the essays resemble short stories in their structure and tension and humor, and Baldwin's writing is just as strong when he's angry as when he's lighthearted. Most important, none of these essays have dated in any significant way, and they still offer stirring insights on race and society in America.his brother's church quartet was sent by the Progressive Party to Atlanta, ostensibly to sing at church events, but inevitably as free labor for canvassing activities--with no pay, poor lodging, and substandard food.

Rowland Mahler and his wife, Nina, operate College Sunrise, a post-secondary school which moves from one European location to another, not merely for a change in ambience but mostly to outrun the school's piling debts. While Nina manages the school, Rowland is supposed to be writing his novel, but he's suffering from an intractable case of writer's block.<br /><br />To put it more accurately: \\"Rowland was simply going mad with jealousy about the writing of novels.\\" One of the school's students, the handsome and popular Chris Wiley, is discovered writing his own book--a historical work about Mary, Queen of Scots. Soon enough, Chris's novel has attracted both the attention of several publishers and the murderous envy of Rowland, who whines that Chris is \\"trying to pass himself off as a creative writer, when all he's doing is exploiting his looks and his youth.\\" And Chris, in turn, discovers that he is unable work on his book without the motivating presence of Rowland's jealousy.<br /><br />Added to this plot are a few random descriptions of the other students (and their familial backgrounds) and some generally blithe comments about society (\\"it's hypocrisy that makes the world go round\\"), etiquette (\\"if you are offered a plover's egg as a snack...you want your right hand to be free to shake someone else's hand [so] your left hand should hold the plover's egg\\"), and liberalism in education (Nina obliges when the students want \\"to be reminded of what an exam was like\\").<br /><br />The slightness of Spark's 23nd novel is more than compensated by the sharpness of its observations on creativity and competitiveness.

Each section could be read on its own (and, in fact, the first, \\"Collies,\\" won an award for best novella in 1999), but, taken as a whole, they encompass a multifaceted portrait of Fenno McLeod, his family, and his friends.<br /><br />Told from the third person, \\"Collies\\" serves as a prologue and introduces us to the three sons of Paul McLeod, who travels through the Greek islands and reminisces about the poignant family reunion in Scotland effected by his wife's death. The second part, \\"Upright,\\" takes up most of the book. Fenno is the narrator, skipping back and forth between his father's funeral and his expatriate life in Manhattan, where he befriends the catty and urbane Malachy Burns, manages a bookstore in Greenwich Village, and has a unexpected dalliance with a photographer named Tony. Fenno's reserved relationship with his two brothers mirrors his tense friendship with Mal, who, dying of AIDS, maintains his own dignity and an admirable drollness that challenges both his mother's intrusive (yet occasionally endearing) rectitude and Fenno's \\"constipatedly humorless\\" aloofness.<br /><br />Drastically shifting perspective once again, the final section, \\"Boys,\\"  is a fitting epilogue seen through the eyes of Fern, whose getaway with Tony in the Hamptons is unexpectedly augmented with a visit by Fenno and one of his brothers.<br /><br />The change in perspective, dramatis personae, and even tone between each section is certainly peculiar and seems to puzzle some readers; the character of Fern especially resembles a late arrival crashing a family gathering that's almost over. In an interview for Bookbrowse (an online magazine), Glass described her book as \\"a triptych--that is, a strong central image flanked by two narrower, more modest images,\\" and she compared her novel to a medieval altarpiece in which a \\"central panel--be it a picture of the annunciation, the crucifixion, or a martyrdom--is flanked by panels depicting portraits of the altarpiece donors.... Here was Fenno's large, rich story at the center, told directly to the reader, with Paul and Fern portrayed in intimate detail to left and right but seen from the side.\\"<br /><br />For me, it works. And Glass's tri-fold \\"painting\\" is enhanced both by the enviously discerning empathy for her characters and, above all, by a genius for infusing wit and warmth into the decidedly melancholy core of her tale. Fenno and his brothers, Mal and his mother, and even the latecomer Fern are characters I won't soon forget.xion, or a martyrdom--is flanked by panels depicting portraits of the altarpiece donors....

Although hundreds of delegates arrived from nearly every would-be state in Europe and from as far away as  Australia, Japan, and Vietnam, most of the important decisions at the Paris Conference were made by Woodrow Wilson, England's Lloyd George, and France's Georges Clemenceau, with Vittorio Orlando of Italy playing a secondary role.<br /><br />In spite of (or, perhaps, because of) Wilson's uncompromising idealism, Lloyd George's lack of confidence, and Clemenceau's fears of German reemergence, the Conference assembled a treaty that \\"grappled with huge and difficult questions,\\" and, MacMillan argues, \\"if they could have done better, they certainly could have done much worse.\\" One thing is clear, however: regardless of their rightness or wrongness, expertise or incompetence, the peacemakers made decisions that resonated for the rest of the century and still echo in the 21st century: between Serbia and Croatia; among Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus; throughout the Middle East (especially Iraq and Palestine); across the African continent; and in the Korean peninsula. Because of the importance of the Treaty of Versailles on subsequent events, \\"Paris 1919\\" is essential--and riveting--reading for understanding the world today.<br /><br />At times, the conference proceedings display all the gravity of a game of Risk. The major participants repeatedly exhibit an appalling ignorance of geography, an artlessness in dealing with non-European powers, and (for all their talk of self-determination) a callousness towards territorial viability. During one of the Conference's nadirs, when the future of Asia Minor was thrashed out, Arthur Balfour exclaimed in disgust: \\"I have three all-powerful, all-ignorant men sitting there and partitioning continents with only a child to take notes for them.\\" MacMillan acknowledges that the \\"offhand treatment of the non-European world\\" caused serious problems that we are still paying for today. And, among many other examples, she indicates how actions taken at the Peace Conference led to the horrifying destruction of Smyrna three years later.<br /><br />By the end of such a fascinating narrative, one that almost insistently seems to portray the superpower leaders as unsophisticatedly idealistic and patronizingly egocentric, it is still startling for the reader to come across this argument: \\"The Treaty of Versailles is not to blame\\" for World War II and the subsequent rise of Germany.<br /><br />True, MacMillan makes a strong and convincing case (as have other historians before her) that German reparations were not as injurious as many have claimed. She further argues that the real problem was not the treaty itself but that it \\"was never consistently enforced.\\" But her statements avoid the question: what good is a treaty that, as she repeatedly indicates, never had a chance of enforcement?<br /><br />I think what MacMillan truly means here is simpler: given the mess that was Europe in 1919, it's probable that no treaty would have prevented the rise of Hitler and the Second World War. She never quite says this, but she comes close when she defines what was surely the Conference's most insurmountable problem: \\"The Allied victory had not been decisive enough and Germany remained too strong.\\" To blame the treaty, then, is to ignore both German strength at the end of World War I and \\"the actions of everyone--political leaders, diplomats, soldiers, ordinary voters--for twenty years between 1919 and 1939.\\"<br /><br />But she is mistaken, I think, to insist so absolutely that World War II \\"was a result of twenty years of decisions taken or not taken, not of arrangements made in 1919.\\" Her own evidence (not to mention the arguments and predictions she cites by Keynes, Balfour, Foch, and others who were dissatisfied with the treaty in 1919) proves it must be seen as a mixture of what happened (or didn't happen) before, during, and after the Peace Conference. The Treaty may not have \\"caused\\" World War II, but it's difficult to see how it helped prevent it.<br /><br />Fortunately for the reader, however, it matters little whether or not you agree entirely with the categorical nature of her underlying thesis. \\"Paris 1919\\" is the type of \\"big picture\\" narrative history that is both enlightening and engrossing, and it must be regarded as the now-definitive work about the Treaty of Versailles.s it must be seen as a mixture of what happened (or didn't happen) before, during, and after the Peace Conference.

Stockis, a wealthy and shadowy butterfly collector from Sweden, engages J. to find the yazikus, a nocturnal specimen that is extremely rare and difficult to catch. While in Istanbul, however, J. falls in love with an equally elusive \\"nocturnal butterfly\\" of a different sort: a prostitute named V. Trapped in Turkey by an Armenian thug who lured her there under false pretenses, V. enlists J. to help her escape her bondage and return to Russia, only to vanish when they both arrive.<br /><br />All this is made known to the reader in the first few pages, and the bulk of the novel details seven letters he unexpectedly receives from V. while at a pension in Livadia, recounts the events that led to J.'s abandonment and despair, and describes his attempt to construct an appropriate response, a letter that will make his feelings known to V. and bring her back to him. He assembles their story in bits and pieces, much \\"like the mental process I am using here in Livadia, reconstructing her from the fragmented image in her letters.\\"<br /><br />While planning his own letter, J. enlists the help of epistles by famous literary and historical figures, from Saul of Tarsus and Abelard to Oscar Wilde and the Russian double agent Evno Azef. And, of course, the butterflies, the letters, the narrative technique, the Russian themes, the immigrant experience (both the author and J. are Cubans who immigrated to Russia)--all rather deliberately recall Nabokov, who was a famous lepidopterist himself. Prieto skillfully weaves these literary, historical, and biographical details into his own rich narrative, and the result is a collage of compellingly topical yet hauntingly resonant passages.<br /><br />Breaking the density of these musings, which are best appreciated slowly and piecemeal, are the description of J. and V.'s evolving (if one-sided) love affair in Istanbul and a plot drawn from an international thriller, which reaches an unexpected crescendo in a terrific chase scene.<br /><br />Cuban cubism is the facetious label one could use for the novel's structure. A drawback with cubism as a technique in prose, though, is that no matter how solid and invigorating the individual pieces, stepping back from the work reveals both its thematic richness and a narrative jumble. Such bipolarity can certainly work in a painting, but whether it succeeds in fiction will depend entirely on the assiduousness of the individual reader.d V.'s evolving (if one-sided) love affair in Istanbul and a plot drawn from an international thriller, which reaches an unexpected crescendo in a terrific chase scene. <br /> <br />Cuban cubism is the facetious label one could use for the novel's structure.

With its dreamlike sequences featuring scenes built entirely around monologues, the play is O'Neill's first foray into experimental theater, it was the first Broadway play featuring an African-American in the lead role, and it became a 1933 film featuring Paul Robeson. And when the New York Drama League initially refused to invite Gilpin to its annual awards dinner, O'Neill led a successful protest.<br /><br />The story is simple: a Pullman porter, after a conviction for murder, escapes to a Caribbean island and becomes the ruler of the natives. Once the natives grow restless, the Emperor Jones takes flight through a haunted forest, only to be confronted by the ghosts of his own past (his murder victim, prison guard) and of African American history (slavery). Through each of the six middle scenes, which would be a challenge for any actor, we see Jones deteriorating mentally and physically. It all seems entirely implausible, but this short drama is not an exercise in naturalism; instead it is a dark fable prefiguring a later tradition of magic realism.<br /><br />In spite of its place in African American cultural history, however, both the stage directions and the dialogue (as A. R. Gurney points out in another edition of this book) \\"seems nowadays to be badly stereotyped.\\" This is somewhat of an understatement. In addition to the \\"Heart of Darkness\\"-inspired drumming of the natives and the monologues of the fleeing, scared-witless \\"emperor,\\" O'Neill includes stage directions that make the reader wince, as when he describes the chief of the native soldiers is \\"a heavy-set, ape-faced old savage of the extreme African type, dressed only in a loin cloth.\\"<br /><br />These uncomfortable representations are set off only slightly by the play's only white character, who is a two-faced and greedy manipulator of the situation. Once you get past these considerable faults, typical of the societal attitudes of yesteryear, the play's power and originality are impressive.l of the societal attitudes of yesteryear, the play's power and originality are impressive.	2004-10-02

(Those readers who haven't read \\"Perdido Street Station\\" will want to know that this \\"sequel\\" is a completely standalone book; I haven't read the earlier work yet and, although there are a very few scattered references to characters and events from the first novel, they are in no way crucial to the plot. Not once did I feel like I didn't understand precisely what was going on.)<br /><br />The action here is set on Armada, a floating city of pirates. The concept of a floating city formed by boats lashed together is not a new one in fantasy; most recently David Drake set a large part of \\"Lord of the Isles\\" among the Floating Folk, scavenger tribes who lived entirely on houseboats lashed together traversing the wide oceans and sending out \\"catcher boats\\" for supplies. But the resemblance of Mieville's world to previous efforts is only superficial: never has anyone created a maritime society to such vivid effect.<br /><br />In Armada, usually incompatible creatures and societies exist peacefully (if uneasily), both because they are outcasts from the larger world and simply because they must in order to survive in the hostile ocean environment. There are the Remade (biologically engineered mutants), scabmettler (whose blood coagulates upon slashing), Cactacae (cactus-people), and even vampir. Armada adds to its inhabitants by \\"press-ganging\\" new members--capturing imperial ships, detaining their inhabitants, and indoctrinating them into its societies. The new inhabitants are pretty much free to do whatever they want in their new home--except they can never leave.<br /><br />In addition to its fully realized atmosphere, \\"The Scar\\" boasts an extraordinarily convoluted (yet credible) plot and several of the most memorable characters to be found in science fiction or fantasy. To its inhabitants, Armada is alternately a prison or a paradise. The heroine, the newly press-ganged Bellis Coldwine, is both defiant and well-meaning, but she inadvertently unleashes a chain of events with unexpected consequences for both her old residence of New Crobuzon and her new city of Armada. As the man who controls the goings-on of Armadan society behind the scenes, Uther Doul scorns power for himself but doesn't hesitate to use it when necessary. A castigated exile and slave from New Crobuzon, the grotesquely \\"Remade\\" Tanner Sack realizes that Armada means freedom for him and his kind, and he willingly takes his mutant engineering to the next level. Only the young and kindhearted Shekel never seems to fully realize his potential as a heartwarming counterpoint in this harsh world; it's a minor quibble, but I wish we'd seen more of him in this book.<br /><br />The story takes several unusual (and satisfying) turns and moves along at a lively pace while pausing to embellish the idiosyncrasies of Armada and its inhabitants.

Entirely revamped from an earlier play (\\"Chris Christophersen\\"), this four-act drama depicts a headstrong young woman, Anna, who renounces her life as a prostitute and tracks down the father who abandoned her as a child. Enamored of his new charge and unaware of her past, Christopherson (O'Neill changed the spelling for this version) tries to pamper and protect the daughter he had neglected during her formative years.<br /><br />Yet Chistopherson has issues of his own: now a captain of a coastal coal barge, he, too, has lived a seafaring live of loose morals and social irresponsibility. Believing that the vigorous demands and easy temptations of a sailor's career have ruined his own life, he has abandoned the sea for good. Confronted with a daughter who initially enjoys life on the ocean, he swears to keep her both from its influence and from the men who make their living from it--with predictable results.<br /><br />When Anna falls in love with Mat, a stoker for a steamer, she finds herself torn between her father's expectations and her lover's demands, and she discovers that both men, like the clients from her previous life, are buffoonish cads and patronizing bullies. The third act, which depicts the inevitable three-side confrontation between Anna and her two \\"protectors,\\" is one of the most skillfully scripted clashes in American theater.<br /><br />The final act, alas, succumbs to a conventional melodramatic mawkishness. Yet overall the play is saved by the faithful rendering of sailor's speech, the emotional depth of its characters, and the (for its time) forward-looking presentation of social ills.	2004-09-25

Since \\"Anna Christie\\" is one of O'Neill's better known plays (and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize), this early version has not received much critical or theatrical attention, but fans of Eugene O'Neill will certainly appreciate it.<br /><br />The basic plot of \\"Chris Christophersen\\" is the same as \\"Anna Christie\\": Anna, the daughter of the title character, finds her estranged father in New York City. Formerly a sailor on transcontinental voyages, Christophersen now captains a small barge that hugs the Atlantic coast, always in sight of land. He has sworn off \\"dat ole devil\\" the sea, blaming his career for robbing him of a fulfilling life, killing the male members of his family, and causing him to neglect his own wife and children. When his daughter arrives, the former sailor is determined to keep her from falling in love with either the sea or anyone associated with it.<br /><br />The main difference between this version and \\"Anna Christie\\" is that, in the later play, Anna is a down-and-out prostitute who hides her former life from her father. In this version, the roles are reversed: Anna has been raised by a proper British family, and it is her father who tries to clean up his act. Although some scenes and bits of dialogue are shared between the two versions, the divergence is enough to make this earlier draft feel like an entirely different play.<br /><br />But which one is better? Most would agree that \\"Anna Christie\\" is a vast improvement largely because Anna's character is more fully realized. Yet the earlier version (in spite of its rather rushed, lame ending) does a better job, I think, portraying the relationship between two strangers who happen to be father and daughter. There is much to recommend both versions, but what will probably most fascinate fans of O'Neill is the process through which a great playwright resuscitates a play that has merit but isn't quite polished and turns it only one year later into a theatrical success.both versions, but what will probably most fascinate fans of O'Neill is the process through which a great playwright resuscitates a play that has merit but isn't quite polished and turns it only one year later into a theatrical success.	2004-09-25

The first difference is getting all the attention from the critics: he has written a political potboiler in an entirely different genre, a fable that recalls Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" Octavia Butler's \\"Kindred,\\" and (of course) Sinclair Lewis's \\"It Can't Happen Here.\\"<br /><br />But, second, this latest work is his most accessible and thickly plotted novel to date, and--in spite of the forceful political theme--it is also perhaps his mellowest work of fiction. Although the prose is identifiably Roth's, the narrative is a real page-turner merged with a loving family portrait.<br /><br />Thanks to the media hoopla, the novel's storyline is already well-known: the book posits a United States where, in 1940, Charles Lindbergh becomes president. Roth scores a subtle political and historical point here: the reader soon realizes that President Lindbergh himself never expresses overtly anti-Semitic remarks or actions. Instead, the true threats to American democracy are the men Lindbergh chooses for his bipartisan government, including Democrat Burton Wheeler (as Vice President) and the virulently anti-Semitic Henry Ford (as Secretary of the Interior). Furthermore, remaining true to a policy of \\"American First\\" isolation (a view Lindbergh steadfastly supported in real life), the new administration negotiates a nonaggression pact with the German Nazi government, develops faith-based programs to \\"integrate\\" Jewish residents into American society (with the ostensibly secondary goal of separating them from each other), and maintains an aura of serenity and acquiescence in the face of a rising tide of domestic anti-Semitism. (The volume includes a 30-page appendix with true-life biographical summaries of the historical figures, as well as the complete text of Lindbergh's infamous 1941 speech accusing the British and Jews of conspiring to lead the United States into war.)<br /><br />Yet that's only half the story. Roth's cautionary tale swings between the \\"alternate history\\" of the United States and the domestic drama of his own family. Told from the point of view of a seven-year-old Philip Roth, the novel is a riveting yet loving portrait of an average American family who fight and bicker about the most mundane matters in spite of the gathering storm. The most immediate concerns, from the perspective of the young narrator, are the condition of his beloved stamp collection, the hovering presence of the nerdy kid living in the apartment downstairs, the ghosts in the cellar, the grotesqueness of his good-for-nothing cousin's amputated leg, and (above all) the division among members of his household that result when his older brother, his aunt, and a local rabbi passionately support the goals of Lindbergh administration.<br /><br />Although Roth's trademark wit and humor are always present (and there are some superbly hilarious one-liners and slapstick episodes), many of the elements one usually associates with his novels--graphic sex, profane language, belligerent characters, and odious behavior--are entirely subdued or missing. You won't find a protagonist like Mickey Sabbath in \\"The Plot Against America.\\" Instead, the book's true heroes in the midst of this upheaval are Philip's parents, who struggle to save their extended family from their own despair and from outside danger. And the most poignant and memorable passage in the novel is when young Philip's idea of his mother undergoes a \\"startling change\\": that she is \\"a fellow creature,\\" and he is \\"shocked by the revelation, and too young to comprehend that there was the strongest attachment of all.\\"y half the story.

This purchase was actually my first-ever exposure to the CliffsNotes series--and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Written by Stanley Baldwin, this short handbook offers a chapter-by-chapter overview of the \\"Education,\\" delivers the necessary historical and biographical background, and highlights the work's important themes.

He had 100 copies printed in luxurious editions and, in early 1907, sent them to such dignitaries as Theodore Roosevelt, William and Henry James, Charles Gaskell, and Henry Cabot Lodge. This private account was not released commercially until after Adams's death, in 1918, when it became a best-seller and won the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />Many scholars and critics, as well as Adams himself, view \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" as a sequel to his earlier book, \\"Mont Sant Michel and Chartres\\" (also privately printed). Indeed, the posthumous edition of the later work opens with an Editor's Preface (signed by Lodge, but presumptuously written by Adams himself) in which the author proposes subtitles for each volume: respectively, \\"A Study of Twentieth-Century Multiplicity\\" and \\"A Study of Thirteenth-Century Unity.\\" While the two works are certainly linked thematically, they are not companion works in the traditional sense: \\"Mont Sant Michel\\" is a personal examination of medieval institutional and cultural history, while the \\"Education\\" is Adams's reckoning of his own involvement in international diplomatic affairs and intellectual circles. In other words, one can safely and profitably read one book without reading the other.<br /><br />So what is this difficult-to-categorize book about? Reduced to its simplest level, it recounts how an \\"eighteenth-century American boy\\" grew up during the nineteenth century, only to be intimidated and awed by the chaos of the twentieth. The unity of earlier ages, when everything revolved around God and Church, had been exploded into limitless possibilities by the discoveries of science and the advent of democracy, and Adams realized that \\"the child born in 1900 would then be born into a new world which would be not a unity but a multiple.\\"<br /><br />This somewhat obvious yet essential theme aside, the joy of this book for many readers is Adams's sardonic wit and his penchant for aphorisms; the number of quotable quotes is both delightful and exhausting. A notorious name-dropper, he knows everyone, and offers an insider's account of the most important events of the nineteenth century, volunteering his views on international diplomacy, monetary policy, evolutionary biology, and other matters.<br /><br />Adams portrays the journey of his life as an ongoing attempt at educating himself, yet he disdainfully learned that formal education was useless and that his dabbling had brought him to a dead end. \\"Religion, politics, statistics, travel had thus far led to nothing.... Accidental education could go no further, for one's mind was already littered and stuffed beyond hope with the millions of chance images stored away without order in the memory. One might as well try to educate a gravel-pit.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Adams's self-effacing protests of ignorance are often little more than a pose. His sense of innate blueblood superiority can be grating--a stance exaggerated by his writing about himself in the third person. He repeatedly (and backhandedly) reminds the reader how, as stupid as he might be, he is in good company: \\"Adams knew only that he would have felt himself on a more equal footing with them had he been less ignorant.\\" \\"Lincoln, Seward, Sumner, and the rest, could give no help to the young man seeking education; they knew less than he.\\" \\"Ridiculous as he knew himself about to be in his new role, he was less ridiculous than his betters.\\" One of the most unintentionally satisfying sections of this book, then, is when Adams finds himself among true aristocrats in England--and they dismiss him as a social inferior.<br /><br />As even Adams's biographer Ernest Samuels and Adams specialist John Carlos Rowe both acknowledge, the \\"Education\\" is an extraordinarily challenging work. Writing for his friends, Adams assumed a familiarity with arcane historical details about such affairs as American-Confederate-British diplomatic machinations during the Civil War, the Gold Scandal of 1869, and John Hay's role in developing China's Open Door Policy. Even the annotations provided by standard commercial editions may not be enough for many readers to flesh out what Adams is talking about.<br /><br />If there ever was a book that requires a study aid, this is it. Assuming you can overcome the common predisposition against such guides, you will discover that CliffNotes provides, in a useful narrative form, the necessary historical and biographical background--although it is certainly no substitute for the wit and wisdom of the work itself.

(\\"Bread and Butter,\\"\\"Servitude,\\" \\"The Personal Equation,\\" and \\"Now I Ask You\\" all were completed before 1916, although none of them were performed during O'Neill's lifetime.)<br /><br />A commercial success and winner of a Pulitzer Prize (the first of four for O'Neill), \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" is somewhat jarring to the modern ear in both theatric arrangement and thematic development; it shows a still-green O'Neill struggling to convey his characters' emotional depth and psychological torments in the not-quite-convincing framework of a melodramatic plot.<br /><br />The problems start in the very first act, when Robert Mayo, a youth inclined to poetry and a life of idleness, is preparing to leave for an apprenticeship at sea with his uncle. In the matter of a few pages, Robert confesses his love for his brother Andrew's childhood sweetheart, Ruth;  he casts aside the plans for his voyage and decides to live as a farmer--an occupation he despises; the love-struck couple agree to be married forthwith; and Andrew, in bitterness, assumes Robert's position on the ship and leaves the very next morning for a journey of several years. All in a evening's work. This abbreviated soap opera suffers from a lack of any attempt at dramatic preparation or character development; Ruth, in particular, pretty much walks onto the stage and ecstatically accepts Robert's out-of-the-blue marriage proposal. As O'Neill was to learn later in his career, it takes a much longer play to set up this sort of scenario.<br /><br />Fortunately, the rest of the play is much better; it focuses on the deterioration of Robert and Ruth's hasty marriage, with Ruth regretting her decision and pining for Andrew's infrequent visits. In these two acts, O'Neill avoids impulsive, life-changing choices and more effectively shows slice-of-life scenes: Ruth's fights with her mother and her indolent husband, Andrew's exultant although brief return, the near-bankruptcy of the farm, and Robert's declining health. Although the play closes with a sentimentality bordering on bathos, these two acts herald the first triumph of one of America's great dramatists.fights with her mother and her indolent husband, Andrew's exultant although brief return, the near-bankruptcy of the farm, and Robert's declining health.

Although it has a number of shortcomings, Jacoby's spirited and opinionated overview serves as a corrective for the prevalent view that the history of the United States is that of a strictly \\"Christian nation\\" (whatever that term may mean).<br /><br />The book is at its best when Jacoby discusses particular historical figures, treatises, movements, and events. She focuses on such stalwart and respected authorities as James Madison, Thomas Paine, Abraham Lincoln, Walt Whitman, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Ernestine Rose, Robert Green Ingersoll, Margaret Sanger, and Clarence Darrow. These biographical accounts include generous excerpts from and perceptive analyses of their writings and speeches. The lives and works of freethinkers are examined in the context of various movements and events, including Deism, anticlericalism, abolitionism, the Civil War, feminism, the first Red Scare, the Scopes trial, the growth of Catholic influence in urban politics, and the culture wars of the last two decades.<br /><br />Nearly all this history is told as a series of captivating biographies and trenchant stories, and the result is unusually accessible and pleasurable reading. There are also some truly memorable anecdotes: the bravery required by Angelina and Sarah Grimke to inveigh against slavery in an era when women did not make public speeches; the issuance of the two-cent piece in order to accommodate the request by a small cadre of Christians to add \\"In God We Trust\\" to the currency; the uproar that greeted the publication of \\"The Woman's Bible.\\"<br /><br />Jacoby does occasionally overreach; she has a tendency to assert all-encompassing theses and easy generalizations that teeter on the shaky basis of her random sampling of people and events. Thus, \\"the more conservative clergymen and established churches in the North were slow to condemn slavery outright, and even slower to endorse any economic or political action that might bring about [its} end.\\" Such a polemical statement cannot be proved by the anecdotes Jacoby relates and the footnotes she includes, and the sociological evidence required to support this type of thesis is beyond the scope of her research. In a similar vein, she overuses such loaded and imprecise terms as \\"conservatives,\\" \\"the clergy\\", \\"orthodoxy,\\" and \\"mainstream religions,\\" and her occasional attempts at qualification only underscore their vagueness.<br /><br />In addition (as other reviewers and readers have noted), the book presents only secularism of a liberal bent; politically conservative freethought is ignored altogether. I have no love for Ayn Rand, but her secularist influence on American politics is undeniable (as the ascendancy of Alan Greenspan attests); inclusion of such obvious examples would have actually strengthened Jacoby's survey rather than diluted it.<br /><br />Yet the fault for these deficiencies is not entirely Jacoby's: so little has been written for general readers concerning the history of American secularism that such simplifications and omissions are perhaps unavoidable in any lucid reassessment of the historical record. The guts of the book--its stories, its heroes, and its underlying premise--provide a fundamental understanding of the tradition of American liberty that cannot be undermined by any of its failings.ght, and even slower to endorse any economic or political action that might bring about [its} end.\\" Such a polemical statement cannot be proved by the anecdotes Jacoby relates and the footnotes she includes, and the sociological evidence required to support this type of thesis is beyond the scope of her research.

This Dover edition omits \\"Ile,\\" \\"The Rope,\\" and \\"Where the Cross Is Made,\\" and includes only the four one-act dramas set on the \\"tramp\\" steamer Glencairn. All four plays were performed in New York City between 1916 and 1918, and together they first brought O'Neill to critical attention. Although they do not share a storyline, one could easily imagine them staged together as interrelated sketches.<br /><br />Set in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War I (with \\"In the Zone\\" taking place at the onset of hostilities), all four plays share common themes and characters. The only tragedy of the bunch is \\"Bound East for Cardiff,\\" in which the crew of the Glencairn offer aid and encouragement to a wounded sailor who lies suffering from a horrible fall. We meet Driscoll (who is one of two characters in all four plays) as he tends to his dying friend.<br /><br />While occasionally filled with tension, the remaining three plays show the far lighter side of life at sea. \\"In the Zone\\" depicts the crew's frayed nerves while their boat traverses an enemy sea filled with submarines. Smitty hides a mysterious black box and raises the suspicions of his jumpy crewmates--to unintentionally comic (although simultaneously melancholy) effect. In \\"The Long Voyage Home,\\" four of the crew enjoy a shore leave in a dingy London bar, and Olson falls victim to a gang of local sharks. \\"The Moon of the Caribbees\\" sees Smitty, Driscoll, and company anchored off port in the tropics, where, defying the captain's orders, they sneak several native women (and quite of lot of rum) onto the ship.<br /><br />These short, effective plays all display O'Neill's nascent mastery at depicting both sailors' vernacular and their camaraderie (and rivalry). The lack of intensity famous in O'Neill's later works is due more to the brevity of the one-act form rather than to his apprenticeship as a playwright, and one could argue that the Glencairn cycle comprise O'Neill's first major works.an to his apprenticeship as a playwright, and one could argue that the Glencairn cycle comprise O'Neill's first major works.	2004-09-13

Both amusing and rewarding, Wesselmann's book poses two mysteries to the initially baffled reader: What secrets did Caroline Wharton hide from her family when she committed suicide and tied up her estate in a puzzling will? And, more generally, what is it about New Hampshire that inspires authors to populate their fiction with comically eccentric and emotionally challenged misfits?<br /><br />Fleeing from an abusive relationship, Michelle Trutor visits the small town of Derbysville to seek refuge in the childhood home of her friend Arthur Wharton, whom she fondly calls \\"The Balloonist.\\" Arthur enlists Michelle in cracking both the mystery of Caroline's death and the bizarre limitations of her last will and testament. Michelle soon realizes that the secrets of Caroline's life have been encoded in her art collection, in messages left with friends scattered throughout New England, and in pages of riddles discovered in her bedroom--a place declared off-limits to her intimidated family members by to the perplexing terms of their inheritance. Michelle is joined (or thwarted) on her escapade by Arthur's twin brother Proctor, their suspicious niece and housekeeper Roberta, the timid town historian Sissy (also the victim of an abusive husband), and the skulking, greedy estate executor Willowby.<br /><br />So what is it about small towns in New Hampshire, anyway? The residents and visitors of Derbysville recall in surprising ways the parochial oddballs who inhabit Ernest Hebert's fictional town of Darby. Any resemblance between the two authors, however, ends with the idiosyncrasies of their characters. While Hebert evokes the realism of John Updike and Richard Russo, Wesselmann channels Roald Dahl and especially Lewis Carroll (to whom there are frequent allusions). Yet Wesselmann's novel steadfastly eschews phantasmagoria; just when you think Michelle Trutor is about to go down the rabbit hole, the adventure is reigned in by the solid gound of realism (or at least what passes for realism in New Hampshire).<br /><br />The inscrutability of New Hampshire may never be deciphered, but, fortunately for readers, the unveiling of the secrets shrouding Caroline Wharton's life and death is both exceptionally entertaining and (best of all) immensely satisfying. Comparisons to other authors aside, the suspense and comedy of \\"Trutor and the Balloonist\\" inhabit a twisted universe quite unlike anywhere else found in modern fiction.New Hampshire).

Nevertheless, they are fascinating for scholars and writers who might be interested in watching a young, hesitant ingenue transform into an experienced, bold playwright.<br /><br />A few of the plays stand out. \\"Warnings\\" examines the events that lead to a shipwreck, while \\"Thirst\\" and \\"Fog\\" both depict shipwreck survivors struggling to stay alive in the sea; all three prefigure O'Neill's later series of plays featuring sailors. Although unbearably melodramatic,  \\"The Web\\" shows O\\"Neill attempting to write in street dialect for the first time. \\"Abortion\\" is a rather scandalous (for its time) and unexpectedly moving depiction of the aftermath of an unwanted pregnancy.<br /><br />In the volume's one full-length play, \\"Servitude,\\" O'Neill experiments with dramatic structure, opening with a climactic and shocking scene--what proves to be a preview of the finale. While deeply flawed, the play turns out to be a comedy at heart, exhibiting the satirical dialogue and mature witticisms that were to make him the only American dramatist to win a Nobel Prize.	2004-09-05

The survivors have little in common, yet their shared tragedy, subsequent get-togethers, and a series of events throw them all under the same roof.<br /><br />In the center of this trio is Steven Shaw, whose home provides the oasis of last resort for the men and their friends. Grieving and calloused, depressed and moody, Steven attempts to combat his indifference towards the travel agency he owns, remoteness from an employee who is close to death, and disinterest in the possibility of a new relationship. His journey is aided by Margaret, who runs his business in his absence and cares for the dying Ray, and by Mark, a Hollywood executive with whom he unexpectedly falls in love.<br /><br />Steven's fellow survivors are less centered and more erratic, however. Dell Espinoza allows his anger and grief to degenerate into an obsessive aggression towards an uncaring society and he funnels his hostility towards acts of vandalism, reserving his most vicious attacks for a loathsome, gay-hating evangelist. Not even a loving, empathetic sister Linda can save Dell from his own fury. Stunningly attractive and intellectually shallow, Sonny Cevathas (the third widower) deals with his grief by ignoring it altogether. Discounting his own health problems as minor inconveniences, believing that New Age trickery and \\"positive thinking\\" can halt his own demise, and searching for a rich man to immerse him in undeserved luxury, Sonny is the book's most wicked (although, I'm afraid, scarily accurate) portrayal of one of many men who fooled themselves into initially believing that AIDS could be simply wished away.<br /><br />Depression, anger, and denial--the paths taken by these three incompatible friends--are rarely so clearly demarcated as they are in Monette's characters. (Dell especially represents an extreme that is, thankfully, scarce.) But the author injects his tale of loss and sorrow with enough humor and affection to keep it from the edge of hopelessness.

Yet Atwood isn't content with mere metafiction: instead she takes the concept and cubes it. Here we have a sci-fi parable within a steamy novella within a confessional journal within a novel, all interspersed by newspaper clippings, and the remarkable thing is how everything interweaves so effortlessly and believably.<br /><br />Iris Chase is writing the journal that frames Atwood's novel. She relates the daily, humiliating burdens of old age and reflects on the familial and societal circumstances that led her sister Laura to an apparent suicide half a century earlier. Alongside this journal we read Laura Chase's posthumously published noir-style novella called \\"The Blind Assassin,\\" concerning a well-to-do woman (someone a lot like Laura or Iris) and her torrid, secretive affair with a \\"Red\\" (as in proletarian) rabble-rouser. The book's publication made Laura famous in death, both because of the explicitness for its time and, in later years, because of its subtle feminist message, which made her grave a shrine of sorts. And, finally, within that novella is a pulp fiction science fiction story about the Planet Zycron and its bizarre inhabitants, a morality tale related by the boyfriend to his lover during their trysts.<br /><br />On some level, Atwood's book is a mystery novel--there are several revelations along the way--but (smartly) she doesn't make too much of these secrets. As Iris says when she uncovers the final skeleton (and I won't spoil it here): \\"But you must have known that for some time.\\" And, it's true, most readers will figure out the book's secrets many pages or even chapters before their unveiling. But deciphering the secrets is not even half the fun of this novel. Instead the marvel is watching Atwood fit all the pieces together, create characters that are both fascinating and realistic, and narrate four different (if interconnected) stories in authentically unique styles.ating and realistic, and narrate four different (if interconnected) stories in authentically unique styles.	2004-08-23

He hates his (Catholic) high school, he obsesses about sex and music, and he thinks he might be in love with his overweight childhood friend, Gretchen. In other words, Brian is just your typical adolescent who wants, more than anything else, to belong without seeming to conform.<br /><br />Whether you enjoy Meno's latest novel (published, appropriately enough, by Punk Planet Books) may well depend on (1) if you think \\"Catcher on the Rye\\" really needs to be updated every couple of years and (2) how high your tolerance is for reading 270 pages of 1990s suburban adolescent lingua: \\"OK, so I was going to this punk show, my first ever, I guess, and I had my dad's beautiful black combat boots on, these nice twenty-hole lace-ups, and it was like eight at night, and I started up the stairs and I was taking them by twos because I didn't want my dad to have time to say anything to stop me, and also I didn't want him to see my [expletive] feet.\\"<br /><br />Not much happens to Brian and to his friends--there's no plot to speak of--and the relentless, mindless post-punk lingo is a vogue that I, for one, did not really need to relive. But, still, I couldn't put this book down. Part of Meno's success stems from his ability to make you care: even though Brian is probably the \\"type\\" I would have avoided in my youth, I could still sympathize and empathize with his self-induced angst. The other coup is the consistency of tone; Brian's voice is flawlessly rendered, without a single false note, and his character is instantly recognizable and believable without being formulaic. \\"Hairstyles\\" is, above all, a triumph of style over substance (and I mean that in a positive way); it captures faithfully the experience of being a kid, no matter how mundane and unexceptional that experience seems to us now.	2004-08-21

I greeted the idea of this book with some skepticism, but I'm happy to report that I was wrong: Card's experiment is non-stop, page-turning fun.<br /><br />Like \\"Ender's Game,\\" this novel is a bildungsroman--a coming-of-age story about a boy training to be an intergalactic warrior. Both novels share many of the same characters (including Petra, Dink Meeker, Bonzo, Mazer Rackham, Crazy Tom, and Colonel Graff), entire episodes are recapped from Bean's point of view (although often with an unexpected twist), and even some of the dialogue is repeated verbatim from one book to the next.<br /><br />Yet the disparities are so dramatic that it's truly like reading completely different novels. The opening chapters, set in the slums of Rotterdam, are so unlike anything in \\"Ender's Game\\" that, until Bean finally arrives at Battle School, it's hard to believe you're reading the same series.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Ender's Game\\" or \\"Speaker of the Mind,\\" however, there are no great bombshells or plot twists; the author's usually impressive bag of tricks can't overcome the fact that most of his readers know what will happen at the end, so he doesn't even try to disguise the \\"big secret\\" that made the first book so unforgettable. Fortunately, Card's prose style has matured greatly over the years, so he is able to write instead an extraordinary psychological novel, describing a confusing world from Bean's precocious (but still childlike) perspective and allowing the reader a few minor, but still satisfying, revelations that were \\"omitted\\" from the first installment.<br /><br />It's been many years since I first read \\"Ender's Game\\" (one of my all-time favorite sci-fi books). Although I remember quite well the basic story (who wouldn't?), I forgot enough of the book to make this fifth episode seem fresh and exciting. But I suspect that even readers who just recently read \\"Ender's Game\\" are likely to enjoy Bean's version nearly as much.ember quite well the basic story (who wouldn't?), I forgot enough of the book to make this fifth episode seem fresh and exciting.

Unlike virtual reality games and its many military applications, unlike the news accounts concerning the many victims of Middle East terrorism, Powers's novel favors description and experience over action and emotion. His novel explores the \\"virtual\\" rooms humans create under wildly different circumstances.<br /><br />Both of the book's storylines, which don't converge until the very end, are about the imaginary spaces we create, furnish, and inhabit. In one plot thread, a team of programmers transform an empty closet-sized cubical into a place of desire--a 3-D theater of the fantastical, an interactive carnival that entices and awes its visitors. On the other side of the world, an American hostage trapped in an equally empty Beirut dungeon constructs a place of need, using the stage of his mind to recreate his past, his present, and an endless variety of elaborate fictions.<br /><br />Neither of these fabricated realms is real, but only one of them is essential for survival. Meanwhile, in the \\"real\\" world outside, tanks are mowing down protesters, iron curtains are falling, and an instantly televised war begins.<br /><br />The prose is often a challenge and nearly always fascinating--in small doses. Powers's polymath mind is a warehouse of art and music, literature and history, religion and philosophy, technology and science--and he likes to incorporate his genius into every sentence. Although overwhelming, the deluge of data is remarkably seamless, and I never felt like his brilliance is simply for show. As a programmer from the later 1970s and 1980s, I can appreciate Powers's gift of technogab with a certain post-geek nostalgia, but not every reader will enjoy the wit in passages like: \\"Bergen dreamed that his Tinkertoy docking simulator would one day drive the actual mechanisms it symbolized.

Adie, a disillusioned New York-based artist, is drawn to the possibilities offered by the new media. The thoughts and dreams of Taimur, the hostage in Beirut, are both haunting and believable, and the second-person perspective (\\"Someone brings you food\\") simultaneously conveys the horror of the experience and evokes the imaginative qualities of role-playing games from the 1980s.<br /><br />But--and this is probably the novel's greatest fault, the members of each supporting cast (the Islamic terrorists and the team of Seattle-based computer nerds) are nearly impossible to differentiate. And, finally, the \\"Angels in America\\"-inspired ending, while oddly emotional and initially satisfying, strikes me (on reflection) as a bit contrived. After 400 pages of both brutal and virtual reality, this climactic, unexpected dose of magic realism seems borrowed from a wholly different software package.mousy, invisible man saw the basic switching and feedback networks of natural selection.

The second is Beate Pappenheim/Hildegard Wolf, a fraudulent stigmatic and faith healer who bamboozled her followers before escaping with a fortune.<br /><br /> But, to complicate matters even further, Spark adds a third impostor: a former butler who looks so much like Lucan (\\"They were not indistinquishable, but they might have been brothers.\\") that the two work in league to thwart either's capture. The comedy results when Spark brings together her three characters: a fraud who reenters the \\"real\\" world by assuming a new identity, a murderer who flees to the underworld by assuming a fake identity, and a butler who straddles both worlds by assuming the identity of a killer pretending not to be a killer. Each of the three becomes dependent on the other two for survival, and an uneasy detente results because the exposure of any of them would likely result in the exposure of all three.<br /><br /> Since authorities suspected that Lucan's escape was enabled by his aristocratic peers, the author adds further irony depicting an upper class who protects a murderer because it's the \\"proper\\" thing to do: \\"They seemed to have been faithful in the class-conscious sense.\\" No doubt it's hard for modern (especially young) readers to imagine that, only thirty years ago, upper-class snobbishness extended even to assisting a homicidal maniac. British aristocrats \\"are not the same people as [they] were a quarter of a century ago . . . Since Lucan's day, snobs have been greatly emarginated.\\" Spark is ridiculing both British aristocracy and their hankering for the \\"good old days\\"; it is this theme in particular that recalls the early satires of Evelyn Waugh.<br /><br /> The novel's hasty ending likewise reminds the reader of Waugh's \\"A Handful of Dust\\"; it is somewhat unsatisfying, not the least because the perspective shifts unexpectedly during the final pages. Still, although a slim, brisk read (barely a novella, in fact), \\"Aiding and Abetting\\" hits many of its upper-crust targets while simultaneously mocking the meaning of identity.of Waugh's \\"A Handful of Dust\\"; it is somewhat unsatisfying, not the least because the perspective shifts unexpectedly during the final pages.

A 17-year-old girl, caring for her terminally ill brother, and a much older British veteran, finishing his research for a book on Asia, fall in love amidst the ruins. The (still chaste) couple are then separated by her &quot;evil&quot; parents and they (more or less) wander the earth hoping to be reunited.<br />And I did love the story; it's about as old-fashioned a romance as you can find these days. But the author's prose threatens to swamp an otherwise insightful, magical book. The New York Times reviewer is kind, noting that although &quot;Shirley Hazzard has a blithe disdain for postmodern pieties. . . . her elliptical style will quickly try the patience of all but the most devoted reader.&quot; Another reader comments here that &quot;The dialogue and speech [are] completely inappropriate for the time. She seems to forget that this novel was not set in Victorian England.&quot;<br />Both these criticisms hone in on the problems I have with this book. It's not her prose style that's Victorian: Hazzard's writing is definitely modern (i.e., &quot;elliptical&quot;), but her narrative voice is from a previous century. She borrows Trollope's brain and writes with Joyce's pen. The result is a clinical detachment that can be intrusive and jarring: as omniscient narrator, she tends to spell out the psychological state of her characters rather than allow their actions and behaviors to speak for themselves. At times, it's like reading a New Age psychology text: &quot;Attempts, with Rita Xavier, to deliver something of his soul always miscarried. But he returned to them--because he could not help believing in the sensibility of wounded persons. Or because he could not leave well enough alone.&quot;<br />A second, equally irritating fault is the character of Helen; her depiction is fiction as hagiography. Her romantic perfectionism is tiresome: I found her believable neither as an adolescent girl nor as a youth wise beyond her years. Hazzard seems intent on proving that, without miracles and martyrdom, it's difficult to make saints all that interesting.<br />Nevertheless, those readers who are willing to tackle the challenging prose and forgive the thin characterizations will be gratified by a stirring romance.fectionism is tiresome: I found her believable neither as an adolescent girl nor as a youth wise beyond her years.

This odd, clever, scathingly bitter satire seems a patchwork of various pieces of fiction--and, as its history attests, it is. A little over halfway through the novel, \\"A Handful of Dust\\" veers, rather unexpectedly, from a bitter reflection on an unfaithful wife and her upper-crust coconspirators to a Conradian parody of explorers in the Brazilian wilderness.<br />To explain this incongruity, The Everyman's Library edition of this fascinating work features a must-read introduction by William Boyd, but (as such introductions often do), it contains so many \\"spoilers\\" that readers are warned to wait until afterwards to peruse it. Boyd's essay does, however, summarize two salient aspects of the novel that are prerequisite to understanding (and perhaps enjoying) it.<br />Waugh's first marriage to Evelyn Gardner ended acrimoniously in 1929; four years later (and the year before he wrote \\"A Handful of Dust\\") his heart was broken a second time when Teresa Jungman turned down his proposal of marriage. Knowing this, it's hard not to read the fictional account of Tony and Brenda's marriage, as Boyd does, as \\"Waugh's own exploration of betrayal and sexual humiliation and . . . a form of revenge against the damage inflicted on his psyche by Evelyn Gardner. . . . It is an unyieldingly cruel and vicious portrait of a worthless woman. . . . The novel is full of hate and scorn, not just for Brenda, but also for the society in which she moves.\\" There is no denying that the novel reads like an act of vengeance, and this contempt takes many forms: Brenda, at first charming and innocent, quickly and inexplicably devolves into vapidity and selfishness; Tony's closest friends hide from him their knowledge that Brenda is having an affair; and--at the book's most memorable, pivotal, venomous moment--Brenda shows more concern for her lover than for her only son.<br />Waugh published two entirely different endings, both of which are included in many editions. (Make sure you get a copy that has both versions.) Boyd explains: after writing \\"the first two-thirds of this novel at great speed,\\" Waugh was unsure how to end it, knowing only that he wanted \\"a sad end.\\" For the British edition, he appended, with minor alterations, an earlier short story, \\"The Man Who Liked Dickens,\\" about an aristocrat trapped by a madman in Brazil. Yet he had to write a second ending for the serial publication for Harper's Bazaar in the United States, because he had previously published the \\"Dickens\\" story in a competing magazine. While the British ending is satisfying (and devious) on its own, it nevertheless seems out of place; readers who feel that they have suddenly picked up another story about a different character in the opposite hemisphere will feel some vindication learning that, in a sense, they have done exactly that.<br />I agree with Boyd that the American version, while simpler, is \\"truer to the novel's potent undercurrents than the short story Waugh recycled to finish off his sombre, disturbing tale of adultery.\\" Other readers, obviously, disagree, and find the alternate ending too pat, too cynical, top predictable. (I, personally, enjoyed both endings for different reasons, but found both a little unsatisfying, each belying the book's claim to cohesiveness.)

Lessing has visited the future before, in her five-volume Canopus in Argos series, but this book bears little resemblance to her earlier opus. Sporting less philosophy and more &quot;adventure&quot; (and not as challenging to read as many of Lessing's books), the novel seems aimed at a broader audience; I even suspect she may have written this story with the &quot;young adult&quot; market in mind.<br />Set in Africa thousands of years in the future, after cataclysmic events have destroyed civilization and towards the end of a new Ice Age, the novel certainly boasts plenty of coy references to fossilized and bastardized remnants of our own era. Yet, in spite of its futuristic veneer, &quot;Mara and Dann&quot; has more in common with many fantasy novels than with science fiction. Lessing's plot is modeled after a sword-and-dragon tale: their parents slaughtered, siblings Mara and Dann are spirited away from their homeland during the calamities prompted by an unrelenting famine and drought. As the heat wave advances north, they flee up the continent, searching for a new paradise.<br />Some of the reviews in the press fault the book for being repetitious, and those notices may have, unfortunately, turned off some readers. The New York Times, for example, assigned two inappropriate reviewers: for the daily paper, a critic who has shown a recurring and predictable hostility towards &quot;literary&quot; sci-fi/fantasy novels (and who, if she in fact did read Lessing's Canopus series, certainly doesn't remember as much of it as she pretends) and, in the Sunday Times, a little-known novelist and admirer of Doris Lessing's more &quot;realist&quot; novels who seems never to have read post-apocalyptic fiction at all.<br />On the surface, their chief criticism is correct: like many fantasy novels, this one employs a cyclical rhythm in its presentation of Mara and Dann's escapades--new locale, followed by capture or separation, then dangers and threats, ending with flight or escape. Although the story doesn't start with &quot;Once upon a time,&quot; Lessing admits in her introduction that the characters in this &quot;reworking of a very old tale&quot; end up &quot;happily ever after.&quot; But the critics entirely miss the allegorical (and, yes, political) undercurrent: as the two survivors travel north and each civilization they encounter becomes more &quot;advanced,&quot; individual liberties deteriorate in more elaborate--and more troubling--ways. While journeying through a continent, Mara and Dann progress from the tribal culture of the Stone Age to the mercantile society of the Middle Ages. Their adventures may resemble each other in kind but definitely not in degree, and they &quot;live happily ever after&quot; only when they escape the trappings of &quot;civilization&quot; and accept an arrangement that values individual freedom over collective subjugation.<br />One could argue further that Lessing has created a microcosm of human history, but she's also managed to tell a great story.

Where his debut was ominous and allegorical, &quot;Transmission&quot; is more lighthearted and unembroidered. Even in this new terrain, a hemisphere away and a century later, the author proves himself not only a perceptive critic but also an innovative humorist--and this accessible, whimsical, and frequently scathing novel is really quite funny.<br />Modern and hip, the prose style is such a startling change from his first novel that it's alternately disarming and refreshing. Still, Kunzru resuscitates the basic theme that made his prevoius book so fascinating: Arjun Mehta is an Indian youth who aspires to wealth and acceptance, and he's convinced himself that the only way to fulfill his ambitions is to advance in the dominant culture. A century ago, the center of the wannabe world was Britain; now, it's America.<br />Of course, anyone who's seen &quot;The Guru&quot; or any number of films about starry-eyed immigrants knows where this is going: Arjun's arrival in California, after months of poverty and disappointment and virtual servitude (pun intended), eventually lands him a temp job &quot;on one of those slave visas, being paid a fraction of what it would cost . . . to hire an American engineer.&quot; Naive and lonely, underutilized and unappreciated, and hopelessly preconditioned by Bollywood-inspired myths of the American dream, he is befriended by a bisexual, tattoo-sporting, gutter-talking bohemian--exactly the kind of girl he would never find on the subcontinent. Slightly patronizing yet well-meaning, she flirtatiously introduces him to the full menu of American temptations. Finding himself at the entrance of the gold mine, Arjun loses his moral bearings: when his job falls victim to downsizing, he resorts to thoughtless criminality in a drastic attempt to make himself invaluable.<br />Interspersed with this main story are the tales of two additional characters: the pampered, unhappy Indian film idol Leela Zahir, and Guy Swift, an insufferable British yuppie with lots of bullet-pointed ideas and unlimited capital backing but little in the way of supporting brains or return on investment. (One of the wittiest chapters in the book describes how the coke-inspired Swift condenses to a four-word memo his entire plan to rescue his life, business, finances, and relationship--and then reduces to a single word the note to accompany a &quot;beautiful and tacky and slightly sad&quot; gift meant to win back his alienated girlfriend.) Kunzru deftly weaves these loosely connected, deeply cynical strands to a hilarious--and satisfyingly ambiguous--crescendo.<br />Along the way, the author skewers Silicon Valley, globalization, outsourcing, the marketing industry, Indian movies (including perhaps the funniest capsule summary of a Bollywood film ever written), and more. The pace is madcap, the characters are recognizable, the satire is on-target, and the wordplay is splendid. With this second triumph, Kunzru is fast establishing himself as the foremost commentator on the fear of alienation in an oppressively homogenized world.ughtless criminality in a drastic attempt to make himself invaluable.<br />Interspersed with this main story are the tales of two additional characters: the pampered, unhappy Indian film idol Leela Zahir, and Guy Swift, an insufferable British yuppie with lots of bullet-pointed ideas and unlimited capital backing but little in the way of supporting brains or return on investment.

After 65 years of hedonistic living, he finds himself &#34;wifeless, mistressless, penniless, vocationless, homeless.&#34; Much of his misanthropy was intensified by the premature disappearances of the three most important people in his life--his brother Morty, killed in combat during World War II; his first wife Nikki, who vanished into thin air (prompted, perhaps, by Sabbath's philandering ways); and his insatiable mistress Drenka, who dies of cancer.<br /><br />&#34;Something horrible is happening to Sabbath&#34;: hating the world that remains with him, he contemplates suicide and ceases to follow the random rules of civil society. Whether a reader will find Mickey Sabbath and his escapades humorous (and occasionally poignant) will depend on how funny one finds comedy that originates in obnoxious behavior. There are some brilliantly witty passages, such as when Sabbath wanders the East Village disguised as a bum and, during his panhandling foray, assails a Shakespeare-quoting subway passenger. Yet, much of the time, Sabbath seems too extreme in his hatred to be believable, and his embodiment as a swine whose motto may as well be &#34;Erotic drunkenness, the only passionate life you can have&#34; veers from literary parody to outright fantasy.<br /><br />Let's put aside the implausible gag that so many women find this physically unattractive, hygienically filthy, emotionally unstable lout somehow alluring. (This book does nothing to diminish the oft-voiced critique that Roth understands men at their worst quite well--and women not at all.) Sabbath's much-flaunted Jewishness or his previous career as a puppeteer seem beside the point as well. Instead, this novel comes down to sex.<br /><br />Nearly every reader has noted that, while explicit and often simply crude, the unremitting carnality is too &#34;monotonous&#34; or even &#34;analytical&#34; to be erotic. Roth wants us to imagine Sabbath as a sailor who ponders whether he should include &#34;quotations from Shakespeare, Martin, and Montaigne&#34; in a possible suicide note. Yet both Sabbath as character and Roth as narrator seem to know only two or three words for sexual acts or parts of the human anatomy that could be represented by countless expressions; when it comes to sex, language fails them and they sound like overeager frat-boys. (The dullness plummets to its nadir in an extended, unfunny footnote that replicates  phone sex dialogue.) Phrases and entire sentences are repeated from one libidinal description to the next--and sometimes within the same scene (I could provide a number of examples, but this is a family-accessible site). There's nothing really &#34;salty&#34; about this sailor.<br /><br />If Roth's intention is to numb the reader to Sabbath's gluttonous hedonism, then surely he succeeds: venery has never been so dreadfully boring. (This view will, of course, vary across generations; I suspect male readers of a certain generation might find these passages titillating or perhaps humorous--or, more probably, offensive.) Roth seems to imagine licentious overindulgence as an amateurishly produced pornographic video set to &#34;repeat&#34; mode. What &#34;Kill Bill&#34; is to amputation, &#34;Sabbath's Theater&#34; is to sex--but at least Tarantino has enough sense to vary the camera angle and cinematographic technique from one scene to the next.<br /><br />The tedium of these episodes would be forgivable if they didn't comprise approximately half the novel. And it's too bad, because much of the rest of &#34;Sabbath's Theater&#34; lives up to Roth's reputation as a master satirist of American life--of our predilection for 12-step programs and our fascination with Loreena Bobbitt, etc., etc. As a whole, this novel (along with the equally moribund &#34;Deception&#34; and &#34;Professor of Desire&#34;) showsRoth just spinning his wheels.	2004-06-12

His experiences for the firm provided the background and the name for the Continental Detective Agency that features in most of his stories and in two of his novels (including &quot;Red Harvest&quot;), and Pinkerton operative James Wright served as the model for the &quot;fat, middle-aged, hard-boiled, pig-headed guy&quot; referred to only as the Continental Op.<br />In &quot;Red Harvest,&quot; the Op is summoned to Personville (known locally as Poisonville), where he is engaged by newspaper publisher Donald Willson, who is murdered before the agent has an opportunity to meet him. At first the novel feels like a traditional murder mystery; in its first half there are two homicides (among more than two dozen gangland-style assassinations) whose clues are scattered for the reader--and the Op--to solve.<br />Yet the two whodunits are red herrings meant to distract--and entertain--the reader (and crime novel aficionados will figure both of them out within a few paragraphs). Not just a murder mystery, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; pursues broader themes: how corruption and greed poisons the inhabitants of Poisonville, how the Op is able to thwart the ambitions of various criminals by playing their own unprincipled game, and how his own abandonment of professional code nearly destroys the detective himself.<br />Most of the crooks are stock figures from noir central casting, but the novel's femme fatale, Dinah Brand, is the most memorable. She serves not only as foil to the Op's passionless cynicism but also as a warning to the dangers of the sport: like the Op, she insinuates herself into whichever camp is in control, never dirtying her own hands with the unsavory activities that bring her the money she voraciously accumulates--only to find herself expendable when no faction needs her at all.<br />During a flirtatious rendezvous with Dinah, the Op slips into a laudanum-induced dream, in which he imagines himself &quot;hunting for a man I hated. I had an open knife in my pocket and meant to kill him.&quot; He finds the man and pursues him across a rooftop, where they tussle near the building's edge, only to realize &quot;that I had gone off the edge of the roof with him.&quot; When he awakes, The Op--and the reader--discovers just how near the edge of precipice he has crawled, and the remainder of this perceptive book recounts his journey back from the brink.r />During a flirtatious rendezvous with Dinah, the Op slips into a laudanum-induced dream, in which he imagines himself &quot;hunting for a man I hated.

This conceit allows the author to imagine Max having three distinct chances at winning the love of his life--first as a father figure, then as a husband, and finally as a son--since Alice (his love) doesn't recognize him as being the same person each time. The novel does Sophocles one better, though Max himself wonders \\"is it exactly Oedipal if I married the mother before becoming the son? Is there some other myth with a better correlation?\\"<br /><br />Greer's love of storytelling and enviable cleverness mask the occasional outbreak of sentences you'd more expect to find in a bodice ripper: \\"With fingers spread beneath her scented hair, touching the landscape of her scalp like something beneath the sea.\\" \\"Wide, oh, still lovely face, and yes, of course it was you. My little paper girl, crumpled in a pocket for half a century, unfolded now before me. . .\\"<br /><br />What keeps such purple prose in check is the inescapable gloom of Max's impending demise. For Max, perception is reality, and he spends his life being not who he is, but the person others think he should be. And, unlike what you'll find in a dimestore romance novel, Max is a monster not only physically but also emotionally: his pursuit of happiness is so utterly selfish that he neglects to attend to the few people who love him in return.<br /><br />A final aside: readers who enjoy the phantasmagoric, historical, and literary elements of Greer's novel might also get a kick out of the wit and epic scope of Marc Estrin's \\"Insect Dreams: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa.\\"A final aside: readers who enjoy the phantasmagoric, historical, and literary elements of Greer's novel might also get a kick out of the wit and epic scope of Marc Estrin's \\"Insect Dreams: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa.\\"	2004-06-05
US	41905526	R37F272IQWCMPT	0195124820	504328193	The Better Angel: Walt Whitman in the Civil War	Books	4	10	10	N	Y	Whitman: the poet and the man, in love and in war	Two of America's most famous nineteenth-century authors wrote enduring memorials about the soldiers of the Civil War--yet neither author fought alongside their colleagues. One, Louisa May Alcott, became known to the American public when she published \\"Hospital Sketches,\\" about her experiences as a nurse in the typhoid-ridden hospitals of Washington. The second, Walt Whitman, incorporated his hospital experiences as background for a series of poems he eventually included in \\"Drum Taps.\\" Roy Morris's brief and incisive account of Whitman's unofficial role as a nurse is fascinating not only for the history it contains but for the poetry it elucidates.<br />Although Whitman himself never took up arms, he experienced the brunt of combat both first-hand, through his trips to the frontlines (to seek out his brother), and--more horrifically in many ways--through his kindly visits to wounded and dying soldiers. He patiently spent hours every day, volunteering wherever he was welcome, bringing gifts and sweets and writing letters home for the incapacitated. His vigils often lasted until the boys' deaths, and he would send emotional, plaintive letters to their parents. There can be no doubt that his attentions were appreciated; many veterans wrote to him for the rest of their lives, addressing him as \\"Father\\" or \\"Uncle,\\" and several named their sons after him.<br />Although most of his benevolence was altruistic, there can also be little doubt that a few of the relationships \\"seems to have exceeded mere wartime camaraderie,\\"  as Morris phrases it. Before he fell in love with the Confederate deserter Peter Doyle in 1865, Whitman formed intimate (though not necessarily sexual) associations with many of his patients. At their extremes, the aftermaths of these friendships left him desolate and jealous. In one instance, his pleading missives to the unresponsive Thomas Sawyer, a soldier who returned to the front, occasionally approached the shrillness of a spurned lover: \\"I don't know how you feel about it, but it is the wish of my heart to have your friendship, and also that if you should come safe out of this war, we should come together again in someplace where we could make our living, and be true comrades and never be separated while life lasts.\\" And later, \\"I suppose my letter should sound strange & unusual to you as it is. . .

Just how autobiographical these stories might be is left to the reader's imagination, of course, but they seemed to be based on German eccentrics whom the author knew and whom the reader will be unable to forget.<br />The novel that opens the book, \\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\" (published in 1935 in England as \\"Mr. Norris Changes Trains\\"), is a somewhat comic portrayal of a bumbling, vain double agent who wears an ill-fitting wig and operates in the sleazy underworld contested by Communist idealists and Nazi thugs. The narrator, William Bradshaw, is a British expatriate tutoring English to young Germans in Berlin--someone, in other words, a lot like Isherwood himself. He encounters Norris on a train, and they initiate an often bizarre, always uneasy, on-again, off-again friendship that propels them through drunken nights in sleazy pubs and dangerous rendezvous at Swiss ski resorts.<br />In the second half of the book, \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\" (published in 1939), Isherwood drops the alter-ego and presents himself as the narrator. Character sketches alternate with \\"diary entries\\" and feature an overlapping cast, and some of the minor figures from \\"Mr. Norris\\" make important cameos. The most famous story is \\"Sally Bowles,\\" which later became John Van Druten's play \\"I Am a Camera\\" and inspired the musical \\"Cabaret.\\"<br />Equally notable, however, is the homoerotic \\"On Ruegen Island (Summer 1931),\\" which recounts Isherwood living in a lakeside cabin with the effete, insecure Peter and the athletic, sexually ambivalent Otto, whose Nordic beauty seems transmigrated from an Aryan Youth poster. Otto appears again in a subsequent section called \\"The Nowaks,\\" about Isherwood's schizophrenic life while sharing a crowded attic apartment with Otto's dysfunctional family. The final sketch, \\"The Landauers,\\" concerns Bernhard, the presumed heir of a wealthy Jewish family who operate a Berlin department store. Bernhard's airy cynicism and adopted Eastern spiritualism thwart his business sense and ill-prepare him for the political dangers overtaking the country.<br />Both \\"Mr. Norris\\" and \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\" share a comic esprit eventually overwhelmed by the gravity of the Nazi menace. Together, these stories are an ode to the carefree bohemians, flappers, intellectuals, and misfits who enlivened Berlin before they were swept away by Hitler and his bullying monsters.sumed heir of a wealthy Jewish family who operate a Berlin department store.

Six hundred years after a nuclear holocaust, an abbey of Catholic monks survives during a new Dark Ages and preserves the little that remains of the world's scientific knowledge. The monks also seek evidence concerning the existence of Leibowitz, their alleged founder (who, the reader soon realizes, is a Jewish scientist who appears to have been part of the nuclear industrial complex of the 1960s). The second part fast-forwards another six hundred years, to the onset of a new Renaissance; a final section again skips yet another six hundred years, to the dawn of a second Space Age--complete, once again, with nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The only character who appears in all three sections is the Wandering Jew--borrowed from the anti-Semitic legend of a man who mocked Jesus on the way to the crucifixion and who was condemned to a vagrant life on earth until Judgment Day. Miller resurrects this European slander and sanitizes him as a curmudgeonly hermit, a voice of reason in a desert wilderness, an observer to humankind's repeated stupidities, a friend to the monks and abbots, the biblical Lazarus, the ghost of Leibowitz (perhaps)--and even the voice of Miller himself.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Canticle,\\" Miller's search for religious faith clashes with his respect for scientific rationalism. For Miller, Lucifer is not a fallen angel but technological discovery unencumbered by a moral compass; \\"Lucifer is fallen\\" becomes the code phrase the future Church uses to indicate the imminent threat of a second nuclear holocaust. The ability of humankind to abuse learning for evil purposes, to continually expel itself from the Garden of Eden, perplexes and haunts the author: \\"The closer men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise, the more impatient they seemed to become with it, and with themselves as well.\\"<br /><br />Some readers might be turned off by the book's religious undercurrent, but that would be to mistake fiction for a sermon. The work is certainly infused with the author's Catholicism, but its philosophy is far too ambiguous to be read like a homily. This is no \\"Battlefield Earth.\\" Instead, it is Miller's highly personal act of atonement; he acknowledged later in life that his fictional monastery was first subconsciously, then purposefully modeled on the ancient Benedictine Monastery at Monte Cassino, which, as a World War II pilot, he bombed to smithereens. (An historical aside: most of the major Greco-Roman scientific and mathematical texts were preserved for posterity by Arabic scholars--not by medieval Catholic monks. But this is fiction, and it's not clear whether Miller is trying to replicate Church history as it was or as he felt it should have been.)<br /><br />In many ways, Miller's Catholicism is as conflicted in the book as it was in his own life. He changed religious beliefs several times; in the 1980s, he immersed himself in Buddhist texts. Throughout \\"Canticle,\\" you can see Miller wrestling with his spiritual beliefs and with his own demons, and in the final chapters, Miller includes an extended debate over whether suicide and euthanasia (and, tangentially, abortion) are ever viable options, even to avoid the worst forms of pain and certain death. Although he seems to side with Catholic views on these issues, Miller himself committed suicide in 1996.<br /><br />Rather than distracting the reader with religious and philosophical musings, however, \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\\" is enriched by them. It's not only a compelling, well-written story, it's an allegorical tale that might encourage readers to struggle with their own beliefs and demons.ht be turned off by the book's religious undercurrent, but that would be to mistake fiction for a sermon.

The novel takes a sharp turn, however, once the couple are married and have three children. Part soap opera, part morality tale, Jim and Arvay's story begins as a clash of the Titans and ends like &quot;The Taming of the Shrew.&quot;<br />As Jim becomes wealthy and rises in social status, Arvay's insecurity increases, and she worries that &quot;he had never taken her for his equal. He was that same James Kenneth Meserve of the great plantations, and looked down on her as the backwoods Cracker.&quot; She feels increasingly out of place around their educated, well-off neighbors and even her children. For his part, Jim fears that all his efforts at providing comfort and security to Arvay have come to naught: &quot;He didn't make her out at all. Didn't she want him anymore?&quot; And he feels that Arvay expresses her &quot;love like a coward.&quot; What plagues the couple more than anything else is simply an inability to communicate.<br />Yet it's unclear what message Hurston is trying to convey; at times the &quot;lesson&quot; seems a little creepy. Although Jim never abuses Arvay (in many ways, he's a dashing prince to her Southern Cinderella), the mental and social &quot;tests&quot; to which he subjects her are, at the least, emotionally vexing. Hurston seems to feel that the real problem is Arvay's refusal to mature with her surroundings instead of Jim's expectation that Arvay should appreciate what he's done for her and their family. He clearly loves his wife, but wants her to change. (Sound familiar?) Ultimately, the barometer for success in their relationship is Arvay's ability to redefine herself on Jim's terms, and one wonders if Jim's last name, Meserve, is meant as a wicked pun. (A cynic might argue, hyperbolically, that it's a short skip to the premise of &quot;The Stepford Wives.&quot;)<br />Hurston wrote &quot;Seraph&quot; in 1948, when she had become increasingly conservative, both politically and socially. She was a zealous Republican, she once asserted that &quot;the Jim Crow system works&quot; (although she later claimed she was quoted out of context), and she condemned the Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. the Board of Education. She also joined the Florida Negro Defense Committee largely because she felt the group did not view blacks as &quot;victims&quot;--similar to the way that she seems to lack sympathy for Avray's lack of confidence. One is tempted, then, to read the novel through this prism. Fortunately, however, the book's message is a little more ambiguous than I make it out to be; in the end, &quot;Seraph&quot; describes the emotionally excruciating path necessary to achieve a mutually sympathetic relationship. Whatever the meaning, it's a great story: sometimes funny, often brilliant, and absorbing like a train wreck: you can't take your eyes off Arvay and Jim even when you see they're heading for a collision.re with her surroundings instead of Jim's expectation that Arvay should appreciate what he's done for her and their family.

Paine (and Allen), however, departed from the cautiously nuanced approach to religious issues adopted by his peers and vociferously rejected Judeo-Christian tenets and scriptures. In &quot;The Age of Reason,&quot; Paine outlines his objections to theism and his belief in deism, and he dissects the inconsistencies in both the Old and New Testaments.<br />Paine published the book in two parts: the first he hurriedly finished in January 1794 when he realized he would be arrested during the French Revolution (passages were in fact written from the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, where he was imprisoned). The second part was written the following year, and he responds to the critics of the first part with a no-holds-barred attack on the veracity of the Bible.<br />Paine presents his basic belief that &quot;it is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a word of God can unite,&quot; and later in the book he says that &quot;the creation is the bible of the deist.&quot;  To Paine, the Bible is the word of man, not the Word of God, and he confronts many of the literalist beliefs proffered by the clergy and worshippers in his day. Many of his arguments, once shocking and blasphemous, are now taken for granted. For instance, he analyzes internal evidence in the books allegedly written by Moses, Joshua, and Samuel to show that it's impossible for Moses, Joshua, and Samuel to have written them--a view that most Christians and nearly all biblical scholars acknowledge today. In other ways, he is way ahead of his time, pondering the minuteness of our world in the immensity of the universe, speculating that other planets around other stars may well hold other intelligent species, and mocking the resulting conclusion that &quot;the Son of God . . . would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death.&quot;<br />Paine believes that God made a complex multi-world universe (rather than a single world) so that it would serve as a textbook for humankind: &quot;As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be believed that he organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man.&quot; It is through this &quot;revelation&quot; of nature that believers can know God: &quot;The principles of science lead to this knowledge; for the creator of man is the creator of science, and it is through that medium that man can see God, as it were, face to face.&quot;<br />Even if one disagrees with Paine (and many obviously do),&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is an essential book both historically and philosophically. It should be read whether you hope to provide support for your own beliefs or to discover what non-Christians thought two centuries ago. It's inevitable that every reader will approach this book with an agenda, but even Christians should wrestle with Paine's arguments--since many of them are still heard today.other planets around other stars may well hold other intelligent species, and mocking the resulting conclusion that &quot;the Son of God . . . would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless succession of death.&quot;<br />Paine believes that God made a complex multi-world universe (rather than a single world) so that it would serve as a textbook for humankind: &quot;As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be believed that he organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man.&quot; It is through this &quot;revelation&quot; of nature that believers can know God: &quot;The principles of science lead to this knowledge; for the creator of man is the creator of science, and it is through that medium that man can see God, as it were, face to face.&quot;<br />Even if one disagrees with Paine (and many obviously do),&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; is an essential book both historically and philosophically.

US	41905526	R1GF1SQ3AISDHI	0486408930	29405017	Rights of Man (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	4	27	30	N	N	Paine's prescient screed against authoritarian precedent	\\"Rights of Man\\" (1791-92) is Thomas Paine's famous response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution of France\\" (1790). Although it helps have read Burke's essay, a general background is sufficient to understand and appreciate Paine's basic and groundbreaking arguments.<br />Paine and Burke were originally allies; Burke not only supported self-rule for the American colonies, he also supported the emancipation of the House of Commons from monarchical control and the independence of both Ireland and India. Many of his allies, then, were bewildered by his fervent opposition to the French Revolution; Burke drew the line between territorial autonomy from a distant or aloof government and the total overthrow of existing monarchies and institutions. For Burke, humankind's real enemies were drastic change and \\"unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos,\\" and he proved himself a staunch defender of the status quo, of precedent, and of gradual reform.<br />Jerry Muller, in his recent--and superb--book \\"The Mind and the Market\\" asserts that Burke's denunciation of the French revolution is \\"the single most influential work of conservative thought published from his day to ours.\\" (This, of course, depends on what one means by \\"conservative.\\") Yet Muller and likeminded historians inevitably cherry-pick Burke's more attractive economic and philosophical arguments and foreground Burke's critique, in Muller's words, \\"of the revolutionary mentality that attempts to create entirely new structures on the basis of rational, abstract principles.\\" (Muller doesn't even mention Paine, much less the example of the United States.) Such a focus inevitably sidesteps Burke's brief for the supremacy of European monarchical institutions and of the landed aristocracy. And that's where Paine comes in.<br />With his usual acerbic wit and extravagant rhetoric, Paine, in the first part of his treatise, makes mincemeat out of Burke's sillier statements. For example, he finds especially unspeakable Burke's claim that that \\"the English nation did, at the time of the [1688] Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate [the right of self-rule], for themselves, and for all their posterity for ever.\\" Paine correctly challenges the primacy of a decision made by members of that generation over desires of other generations, questions the right of any generation to surrender the rights of their descendants, and notes that \\"government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it.\\"<br />He also chastises the English for a system of hereditary government that virtually guarantees unfettered rule by children, madmen, idiots, and foreign-born pretenders (and he certainly has plenty of examples from which to choose), many of whom led their realms into chaos and terror without the help of radical revolutionaries. And Paine argues that wars would cease with the promotion of democracy and the cessation of the selfish interests of absolutists. His critics rightly respond that the rise of democratic institutions has hardly stopped wars, although one might pose the counterargument that, relatively speaking, democratic governments go to war with each other much less frequently.<br />In the second part, Paine proposes a radical agenda for an overhaul of the British government. Although his anecdotally based statistics and figures must be viewed with skepticism and a few laughs, the prescience of his proposals is startling: poverty relief, social security, public education, maternity care, homeless shelters, workfare, veteran's benefits, and progressive taxation. His is the agenda of the idealist: \\"When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive . . . when these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and its government.\\"<br />Paine, of course, had the nascent United States to cite in support of his proposals, but he and Burke were debating these matters before the onset of the Jacobin Reign of Terror, which dismayed Paine and seems to have realized Burke's worst fears. Yet, throughout history, for every Robespierre or Lenin, one can find a Mandela or a Walesa; monarchies too were no strangers to upheaval. Paine hardly argued for \\"mob rule\\" or even \\"majority rule\\"; the French Revolution failed in part because it violated the fundamental tenet that the citizens of each nation have a right to choose whatever rule they please, even \\"a bad or defective government, . . . so long as the majority to not impose conditions on the minority, different to what they impose on themselves\\"--a caveat we all should take to heart in today's political climate./>Paine, of course, had the nascent United States to cite in support of his proposals, but he and Burke were debating these matters before the onset of the Jacobin Reign of Terror, which dismayed Paine and seems to have realized Burke's worst fears.

Written in 1987 and published in America in 1990, &quot;My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest&quot; is less an autobiographical novel than a fictionalized autobiography. The young boy at the center of this tale shares Goma's name and much of his past--his father was deported to the Soviet labor camps in the early 1940s, his family fled their home in 1944, and Goma himself was arrested in 1952 and again in the 1956 (and imprisoned until 1962), and eventually was exiled to France. Not mentioned in the book is a famous assassination attempt against Goma in Paris during the 1980s<br />Yet, in spite of this life of terror, Goma has somehow retained a commendable (and sometimes unsettling) sense of humor. Set in the early 1940s, when Goma is six years to eight years of age, the novel is comprised of recollections prompted by an imaginary visit to the &quot;calidor&quot; (verandah) of his childhood home. Goma interrupts (and corrects) his own reminiscences with the memories provided by conversations with his parents, idealistic schoolteachers who moved to the rural village of Mana in Basarabia, a Moldavian province long disputed by Romania and Russia. Amidst the battles of World War II, the arrest (and presumed death) of his father, and the hardships endured by his &quot;widowed&quot; mother, Goma still manages to indulge in the type of behavior many children experience: visiting friendly neighbors, helping the deputy mayor Old Iacobi with his chores, playing games with other children, even risking flirtations with older (and quite randy) girls.<br />Incredibly, Goma's optimism endures throughout, even as the book closes with his family's flight from the village before the Soviet advance. Seen through the eyes of a child with the wisdom of an adult, this story is a tribute to bravery and defiance in the face of peril and hardship.	2004-05-09

Most of the stories share a similar framework--an introductory section followed by an extended flashback (to childhood, to high school, to college, to a previous marriage), concluding in the present with the story's resolution. And most feature a character going through some type of midlife crisis or interpersonal conflict--between generations, between sexes, between classes, between races. Yet, in spite of their similar themes and structures and their calm, melancholy tone, each is remarkably distinctive and--most of all--the characters are instantly familiar. Stolar has a knack for sketching a person or a situation in a few simple sentences, and any reader will admire his ability to write from different points of view (a male college student, a 70-year-old retiree, a young married woman).<br />While all eight stories are memorable in their own way, everyone is sure to have his or her favorites. Mine are: \\"Second Son,\\" about a 70-year-old man whose closeness to his son from a second marriage atones for his remoteness to and impatience with an older son; \\"Fundamentals,\\" portraying a young father who calculatedly raises his son with the forbearance his own father denied him; and \\"Mourning,\\" concerning a college student who, following his mother's death, is rescued from emotional collapse by a benevolent classmate rendered aloof and indecipherable by an upper-class (read: WASP) upbringing. \\"Crossing Over,\\" about a Jewish college student who pledges a black fraternity, seems to have received the most attention; it is a fine story, but reading it is uncomfortable--not so much because of the subject matter but because the many black characters in the story are nearly indistinguishable stage props for the protagonist's self-induced drama.<br />Although Stolar has written a story sharing the book's title (it was published last year in Bomb Magazine), it was omitted from this debut volume. In an interview with a reporter, he said that \\"[My editor and I] kept the title because it just seemed to fit. There's a point in each story where somebody is awake in the middle of the night.\\" Indeed, it's a perfect title for this collection: these stories are about the emotional crises that make insomniacs of all of us.ng the book's title (it was published last year in Bomb Magazine), it was omitted from this debut volume.

And it's one of the funniest books I've read: a protracted comedy of errors and pure boneheadedness.<br />Several years late with his fourth novel, Tripp plays host to his editor, who has arrived for a college symposium on writing and who hopes that Tripp, against all odds, has completed his long-promised magnum opus. With the help of their wayward companions, the undynamic duo collect in Tripp's 1966 emerald green Ford Galaxie 500 convertible: a dead blind dog, a tuba, a rather hefty bag of marijuana, a boa constrictor, a jacket once worn by Marilyn Monroe, 2,611 manuscript pages of an unfinished (and unfinishable) novel, an assortment of pharmaceuticals--all of which are pursued through Pittsburgh by a street tough packing a German nine millimeter.

While the Roosevelt administration touted the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; for which Americans were fighting, those freedoms (freedom of speech and religion and freedom from want and fear) were still not fully extended to citizens, residents, and refugees.<br />In successive chapters, Takaki focuses on the abuses and injustices resulting from the exclusion of minority workers from defense industries, the Jim Crow statutes that segregated African Americans at home and in the army, the unemployment and poverty that greeted returning Native Americans veterans, the hostility towards Mexican Americans for the &quot;zoot suits&quot; worn by their youth, the laws prohibiting longtime Asian laborers from becoming citizens because they were not &quot;white,&quot; the forced internment of Japanese Americans, the callousness that turned away Jewish refugees from our ports. He then examines the controversy surrounding the motivations for using the atomic bomb against civilian population centers.<br />Yet the author also reveals the many advances that the war delivered to ethnic groups. Minority communities contributed tens of thousands of soldiers who fought valiantly on the battlefront and earned the respect and friendship of their white compatriots. The shortage of domestic workers forced reluctant industries to hire non-white workers. A. Philip Randolph and his colleagues launched the civil rights movement by organizing a march on Washington, which was cancelled after Roosevelt signed executive order 8802, abolishing discrimination in government and defense jobs. (The order was largely symbolic, since it was hardly enforced, but in retrospect it was clearly a major first step.) And the sanguine final chapter demonstrates that, although the struggle for civil rights suffered setbacks during the next two decades, there really was no turning back.<br />Focusing one's attention on the domestic issues of the time, of course, does not minimize the contribution of our armed forces abroad; if anything, such a discussion emphasizes that the fight against prejudice was equally important: both because non-white citizens were serving our country and because our enemies used examples of American intolerance as propaganda against the U.S.--and because it was morally necessary. Although written by an academic, this concise book is both fascinating and approachable; it should be read by all Americans who care about freedom. It's a reminder of why we fought what Studs Terkel called &quot;the Good War&quot;: the &quot;double victory&quot; of increasing liberty not only for Europeans and Asians but for every American as well.sanguine final chapter demonstrates that, although the struggle for civil rights suffered setbacks during the next two decades, there really was no turning back. <br />Focusing one's attention on the domestic issues of the time, of course, does not minimize the contribution of our armed forces abroad; if anything, such a discussion emphasizes that the fight against prejudice was equally important: both because non-white citizens were serving our country and because our enemies used examples of American intolerance as propaganda against the U.S.--and because it was morally necessary.

US	41905526	R2TERGSSV5AQLK	0553293354	834333861	Foundation	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A psychohistorical futureworld inspired by Edward Gibbon	In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted, \\"Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all, I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once, but twice.\\"<br />Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in \\"Foundation.\\" A galactic empire, centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome), is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow, the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov, however, goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades): when new and powerful rulers challenge the priestly authority, an upstart mercantile class--the Medicis and Borgias of the galactic future--gain the upper hand.<br />Yet \\"Foundation\\" is hardly a history lesson; Asimov simply channeled his understanding of medieval and Renaissance Europe into a series of intriguing stories, what might instead be described as \\"psychohistorical\\" and sociopolitical thrillers. In the opening chapter, during the dying days of the Empire, Hari Seldon studies \\"psychohistory\\"--a kind of societal (but not individual) determinism based loosely on the idea that broad historical trends are cyclical and predictable. Aware that he cannot prevent the fall of the Empire, Seldon uses his learning to chart a course for the preservation of knowledge and an accelerated re-creation of a Second Empire. (Asimov had no way of knowing, of course, that psychohistory would later become a legitimate field of academic research by such scholars as Peter Gay.)<br />Each of the five episodes in the book reads like a tautly played game of political chess in which the winner is inevitably the visionary who is not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake. The suspense is developed almost exclusively from the \\"cold war\\" tension between rival forces: there's not much action in \\"Foundation,\\" and (as other readers have noted), the lengthy dialogue is spotty and the \\"character development\\" is pretty much nonexistent (although the same could surely be said about such sci-fi classics as \\"2001\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\"). But if you like your science fiction a tad cerebral, you'll find much to admire in Asimov's first major work.s not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake.

She writes about Flaubert (or, more precisely, Cather's friendship with his niece), Mrs. James T. Fields (the widow of the co-owner of the famed publisher Ticknor and Fields), Sarah Orne Jewett, Thomas Mann, and Katherine Mansfield. An additional piece, entitled &quot;The Novel Demeuble&quot; (which might be translated as &quot;The Novel Unplugged&quot;) objects to the excesses in the fiction written by her contemporaries.<br />The title of the collection refers to Cather's lament that most of these writers would no longer be of interest to those then under forty years of age, and there is certainly an &quot;old-fashioned,&quot; even prudish, stance throughout. She dismisses the realists for their &quot;cataloguing of a great number of material objects, in explaining mechanical processes, the methods of operating manufactories and trades, and in minutely and unsparingly describing physical sensations. . . . Have such things any proper place in imaginative art?&quot; Although she mentions only Balzac, she clearly has in mind such American writers as Dreiser, Lewis, and Upton Sinclair.  And she has no brook for Lawrence, whose characters are &quot;dehumanized by a laboratory study of the behavior of the bodily organs under sensory stimuli.&quot; Cather didn't always feel this way; thirty-five years earlier she wrote glowingly of Frank Norris (in an essay not included here), praising the descriptions of workaday environment in &quot;McTeague&quot; as &quot;convincing  proof of power, imagination and literary skill.&quot; Apparently, Cather eventually believed that the scales tipped too far toward realism--or her tastes simply changed.<br />The most interesting, and breeziest, piece concerns Madame Grout, who was Flaubert's niece and lifelong correspondent (the &quot;Caro&quot; in his &quot;Letters to My Niece Caroline&quot;); Cather manages simultaneously to provide a touching account of this aging lady and to instill an increased appreciation of Flaubert's achievement. Probably the key to understanding Cather's work is her ode to Jewett, to whom she was much indebted and whose work she championed to the reading public throughout her life. The weakest essay, it must be noted, is Cather's review of Thomas Mann's &quot;Joseph&quot; novels. She did not live to see the fourth book published, so the essay was premature, and her judgment that these books were Mann's greatest is hard to support. (Dare I say that it would be far more fascinating to know what she thought of &quot;Death in Venice&quot;?) Even here, however, she captures Mann's essence--his &quot;rich deliberateness which is never without intensity and deep vibration.&quot; All the essays, then, will provide Cather fans with a glimpse of the art underlying the fiction she herself published in the late 1920s and the 1930s--from &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; to &quot;Lucy Gayheart.&quot;dent (the &quot;Caro&quot; in his &quot;Letters to My Niece Caroline&quot;); Cather manages simultaneously to provide a touching account of this aging lady and to instill an increased appreciation of Flaubert's achievement.

US	41905526	R2J4JDGJFYJHT	0385497709	548814469	London: The Biography	Books	3	47	53	N	N	Social history as seen by a literary historian	Impressive in its scope, astonishing in its erudition, overwhelming in its detail, &quot;London&quot; contains a smorgasbord of information from an awe-inspiring number of sources. Unlike most histories (much less biographies), most of the material in &quot;London&quot; is organized by theme; only three &quot;events&quot;--the Great Plague of 1665, the Great Fire of 1666, and the Blitz--are examined in depth. Chapters detail architecture, neighborhoods, markets, work, entertainment, food, drink, smells, crime, punishment, madness, sickness, and more. Critics have noted that the reader will find few aristocrats or statesmen among the pages of this book; Ackroyd's focus is on the streets, the habitats, the commoners, and the everyday life of London. Civil war and uprisings, kings and queens, mayors and parliaments are mentioned only in passing.<br />Yet this is certainly no treatise inspired the Annales school. Instead, &quot;London&quot; is a social history written by a novelist and literary historian, one who is more likely to quote Pepys, Boswell, Dickens, or Orwell than to invoke Cromwell, Pitt, Disraeli, or Churchill. The author favors fiction, diaries, essays, and similar remnants of the literati over court documents, tax records, and other types of evidence examined by English social historians such as Lawrence Stone or E. P. Thompson.<br />While Ackroyd excels in compilation, he neglects any attempt at true synthesis. The book's overwhelming erudition, while admirable, is sometimes oppressive, and there seems to be little thought given to the structure of the book. One could toss most of its 79 chapters into the air and read them in the order in which they fall to the ground, with little loss in comprehension. This encyclopedic doorstop is truly a book to dip into, not to read in several sittings. (In spite of how absorbing I found much of its content, it still took me six months to finish it.) The overall effect is a sequence of well-written, thematically ordered index cards flaunting the research assembled by a polymathic mind.<br />The lack of synthesis is further displayed by an annoying tic: Ackroyd often follows a quote or anecdote with a generalized sentiment that begins &quot;So...&quot; or &quot;Here...&quot; A few of the many examples from his otherwise fascinating chapter on children: &quot;Here the idea of innocence, in a corrupt and corrupting city, is powerfully effective.&quot; &quot;So the singing child is alluding to a dreadful destiny within the city.&quot; &quot;So London children were, from the beginning, at a disadvantage.&quot; &quot;So for at least two centuries London children have been associated with, or identified by, gambling.&quot; &quot;So the city hardened its street children in every sense.&quot; The problem with these sentences is not simply their lazy, hypnotic construction; rather, their vacuousness and vagueness add no insight to the quotes they are meant to illuminate. And, more often than not, their fuzzy universalities could apply to Detroit as much as to London.<br />Nevertheless, in spite of its imperfections, one is hard pressed to discount entirely the wealth contained in these pages. I'm sure I'll spend the next few years hauling this tome off the bookshelf to look up a quote or revisit a London neighborhood. But I'm equally sure that I'll never again read through the entire book.dered index cards flaunting the research assembled by a polymathic mind.<br />The lack of synthesis is further displayed by an annoying tic: Ackroyd often follows a quote or anecdote with a generalized sentiment that begins &quot;So...&quot; or &quot;Here...&quot; A few of the many examples from his otherwise fascinating chapter on children: &quot;Here the idea of innocence, in a corrupt and corrupting city, is powerfully effective.&quot; &quot;So the singing child is alluding to a dreadful destiny within the city.&quot; &quot;So London children were, from the beginning, at a disadvantage.&quot; &quot;So for at least two centuries London children have been associated with, or identified by, gambling.&quot; &quot;So the city hardened its street children in every sense.&quot; The problem with these sentences is not simply their lazy, hypnotic construction; rather, their vacuousness and vagueness add no insight to the quotes they are meant to illuminate.

Its protagonist is a shapeshifter, an empty core of a human being who adopts personalities (and names) like coats and discards each skin as the seasons change. First Pran, then Rukhsana/Clive, then Robert, then Jonathan--he is no more real than Candide. (&quot;In between each impression, just at the moment when one person falls away and the next has yet to take possession, the impressionist is completely blank.&quot;) Instead, he represents an implausible idea and a doomed ideal: the conflicted Indian identity in the face of British occupation.<br />Richly plotted, I couldn't put it down, but many readers expecting a lead character to whom they can &quot;relate&quot; are sure to be frustrated. Half Indian, half English, Pran is caught between two worlds. Expelled from his home when his wealthy Indian father discovers his true lineage, Pran embarks on a journey that will take him from the palace of the nawab to the heart of England. Handsome and exotic on the surface, he becomes, alternately, victim and persecutor, all things to all people.<br />While some readers have compared the prose style to that of Bowles, the characters to those of Dickens, and the theme to that of Kipling (all true, to some extent), the true source of inspiration is Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot; Another reader notes that the finale of the novel is &quot;far too indebted to Conrad to be considered original.&quot; (And I promise to avoid spoilers in my attempt to note the parallels and contrasts.) True, Hunzru incorporates deliberate echoes of Marlow's journey up the African river in search of Kurtz: the haunting drumming of the natives, their ferocity in the face of advancing &quot;civilization,&quot; the severed heads on display. But to dismiss this section as mere imitation is missing the point. Much of the book is a negative image of and a response to Conrad's allegory: in &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; the &quot;civilized&quot; Kurtz becomes a &quot;primitive&quot; monster in a quest to lord over a tribe of natives; in &quot;The Impressionist,&quot; Pran/Robert/Jonathan becomes &quot;civilized&quot; and faces in the African hinterlands the vacant reflection of his true self.<br />Jonathan ultimately realizes that &quot;there is nothing there at all&quot;: in his attempt to succeed in one world, he (like Kurtz) belongs to no world at all. &quot;The Impressionist&quot; is as much a commentary on Conrad as it is on British colonialism.a response to Conrad's allegory: in &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; the &quot;civilized&quot; Kurtz becomes a &quot;primitive&quot; monster in a quest to lord over a tribe of natives; in &quot;The Impressionist,&quot; Pran/Robert/Jonathan becomes &quot;civilized&quot; and faces in the African hinterlands the vacant reflection of his true self. <br />Jonathan ultimately realizes that &quot;there is nothing there at all&quot;: in his attempt to succeed in one world, he (like Kurtz) belongs to no world at all. &quot;The Impressionist&quot; is as much a commentary on Conrad as it is on British colonialism.	2004-04-18

Yet, in spite of the hurdles it may present some readers, the book manages also to be fast-paced and hysterically funny.<br /><br />One of the triumphs of Brunner's book is that it can be read on any number of levels, which is probably why it seems to resonate with readers of extraordinarily divergent tastes. Having read it twice (once as a bookwormish Valley brat and now twenty-odd years later as a still-bookwormish publishing professional), I am not surprised that this book might be entirely different beasts to different readers; the enthralling, bewildering thriller I remembered from my adolescence has somehow transformed itself into a darkly sardonic political and social commentary--and I like both versions just fine.<br /><br />The novel is not, at first, an easy read. Its \\"unique\\" jump-cut/collage structure, its pseudo-hip prose style, its fabricated lingo--all are modeled rather precisely on John Dos Passos's classic American classic trilogy, \\"U.S.A.\\" Like Dos Passos, Brunner interlaces chapters in several strands. The bulk of the storyline appears in the \\"Continuity\\" chapters, which detail the misadventures of secret agent Donald Hogan and corporate executive Norman House, and the \\"Tracking with Closeups\\" chapters, which describe two dozen characters who are peripheral to the action. The other two strands--\\"Context\\" and \\"The Happening World\\"--provide background material (film descriptions, encyclopedia entries, song lyrics, document excerpts, advertising jingles, news stories, etc.) that catalog a world drowning in both information overload and an excess of people who would no longer be able to stand \\"on the island of Zanzibar without some of them being over ankles in the sea.\\" Much of the novel revolves around how various nations and individuals deal with the perceived need to limit births both in number and in quality. (A helpful hint to the baffled reader: \\"Read the Directions,\\" the first chapter in \\"The Happening World\\" sequence, serves as both a dramatis personae and a jargon decoder.)<br /><br />After the first 75 pages or so, once you're accustomed to the pace, the book is smooth sailing; it's as much a novel to be admired as enjoyed. And it's one of the most wickedly, playfully funny books ever written--in any genre. The plot is far too complicated to attempt to summarize here; suffice it to say that Donald is trying to thwart a potentially dangerous and politically volatile eugenics program and Norman is struggling to increase his company's profits while simultaneously enriching an underdeveloped yet perplexingly peaceful African nation.<br /><br />The two plots seem disconnected, yet at heart is the juxtaposition of naked greed and dignified idealism, of selfishness and altruism, of capitalism and communalism, of totalitarianism and anarchy. (At times, the overt political and sociological messages recall Le Guin's \\"The Dispossessed.\\") Or, as the character Chad Mulligan puts it in one of his sociological treatises, \\"applying the yardstick of extremism leads one to conclude that the human species is unlikely to last very long.\\" Yet Brunner avoids the trap of losing himself in the hopelessness of his nightmarish world; instead, the resilience of human ingenuity and the vision for a better world still stand a chance, even on Zanzibar.ea.\\" Much of the novel revolves around how various nations and individuals deal with the perceived need to limit births both in number and in quality.

With \\"Headlong,\\" he's done it again: merging satirical farce and historical mystery--the sort of novel P. G. Wodehouse and Umberto Eco might write together.<br /><br />The plot is nothing short of brilliant in conception and nearly perfect in execution. Martin Clay, a professor of philosophy, and his wife Kate, an art historian, have gone on a sabbatical at their country home. \\"We don't want to drive 100 miles out of London only to meet people who have driven 100 miles out of London to avoid meeting people like us.\\" (Frayn is a master of the quotable quip.) Martin has procrastinated writing a book on a topic that sidesteps a bit into his wife's field--both his delays and his turf-crossing are sources of tension between the two--but the couple soon encounter a new and imposing distraction: the neighbors. The initial meeting, a side-splittingly funny dinner between the frumpish academics and two not-so-bright members of the rural gentry (\\"My God, I've never met a philosopher before\\"), is as funny as anything Wodehouse ever penned.<br /><br />There's a catch to the dinner invitation: the neighbors have a few paintings that they'd like the two \\"experts\\" to examine, just to see if they just might be worth anything. The first is by an Italian artist named Giordano. (Here Frayn makes his first mistake: anyone who knows much about the art world will know instantly that this one's not as insignificant as the author wants you to believe.) The second and third seem to be unremarkable 17th-century Dutch canvases. After his wife leaves the room, Martin views the fourth painting and is convinced that it's the missing panel from the six ''Seasons'' paintings by the Flemish master Bruegel--a work that, if it exists, would be priceless and instantly famous.<br /><br />Now, there is absolutely no record of what this Bruegel might even look like, but that doesn't stop Martin from falling \\"headlong\\" into a comedy of errors. He embarks on a scheme to convince his wife (and himself) of the validity of his initial surmise and to \\"relieve\\" the owners of their possession in exchange for a small payment that is still high enough risk everything that Martin and Kate own. At this point, the farcical comedy turns intellectual mystery, as we read summaries of Martin's research on Bruegel's life and work, sixteenth-century Netherlands, the Inquisition, the Counter-Reformation, and more. Admittedly, some readers might find all these \\"facts\\" a drag on the story, but I think Frayn skillfully weaves the elements of the mystery and the historical detail with the themes of his satire and the various plot elements (including his depiction of the Clays' marriage). If you love history and art--even (or perhaps especially) if you don't know a thing about Bruegel--the payoff is especially keen.<br /><br />The only false note is the portrayal of Martin's wife. Although Martin himself is a buffoon--perhaps too much so--it's easy to visualize the type of stubborn, myopic know-it-all Frayn means to lampoon. Kate, however, is little more than a plot device--a compliant marshmallow who accommodates her husband's tomfoolery without offering much in the way of resistance. She's hard to imagine and impossible to believe, and if the author means to aim his barbs at a particular target, it's lost on me.<br /><br />Although the ending is a little more than predictable, it's still both hilarious and satisfying. But \\"Headlong\\" isn't a book you read simply for the unfolding of the plot and the solution to the mystery; instead, its main satisfaction is the cerebral stimulation offered by the author's adroitness at linking all the loose ends and the many disparate themes.

Focusing on the lives of the inhabitants of a humble--but not wholly destitute--neighborhood, Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel could be (unfairly) dismissed as &quot;Melrose Place&quot; in Cairo. Yet this is no Grace Metalious soap opera; Western readers will instead find that &quot;Midaq Alley&quot; calls to mind the style of Christopher Isherwood, the plotting of Armistead Maupin, and the characters of Rohinton Mistry. And Trevor La Gassick's superb translation make this a surprisingly fluent, elegant, and humorous yarn.<br />Although filmed in 1995 as &quot;El Callej&oacute;n de los milagros,&quot; a critically acclaimed Mexican film starring Selma Hayek, this novel has never quite reached the audience it deserves. Like &quot;Tales of the City,&quot; &quot;Midaq Alley&quot; follows the interlinking stories of several characters who share little more than aspirations to affluence, romantic entanglements--and an address. The reader is introduced to more than a dozen characters, but the novel spotlights three: the cafe owner Kirsha, a married man who flirts with young men in front of discomfited patrons, neighbors, and friends (not to mention his incensed wife); the fickle, young, beautiful Hamida, who flits from man to man in search of wealth and comfort; and Abbas, who joins the British armed forces to earn enough money to win over Hamida.<br />Yet other eccentrics from the alley are just as memorable: the horrid Zaita, who serves as tyrant over the local beggars he has &quot;fashioned&quot; by unusual means (and whose demeanor and methods are astonishingly similar to Mr. Beggarmaster from Mistry's &quot;A Fine Balance,&quot; written 50 years later); Mrs. Saniya Afifi, a widow who undergoes cut-rate cosmetic dentistry to win over a new husband--and then is horrified by the hush-hush source of her new dentures; and the suave, slick, duplicitous Ibrahim Faraj, a stranger to the alley who spirits Hamida away from her home into a world of extravagance and debauchery she never imagined possible.<br />In the background is World War II, which ironically presents inhabitants of the alleys with the prospect of advancement in the &quot;outside&quot; world--an opportunity that proves both short-lived and elusive. Scratch below the surface, and you'll find a morality tale about the ultimate displeasure that materialism brings to those who worship it. Yet Mahfouz avoids didacticism when presenting his themes, opting instead for a light-hearted objectivity that brings the residents of Midaq Alley to life.ery she never imagined possible. <br />In the background is World War II, which ironically presents inhabitants of the alleys with the prospect of advancement in the &quot;outside&quot; world--an opportunity that proves both short-lived and elusive.

Owner of a business hosting social events out of her dilapidated if sprawling home, the widow Rebecca Davitch suddenly realizes that, in spite of her veneer of sunny happiness, her own uneventful life seems unfulfilled. She has sacrificed her days--and nights--to her late husband's aged uncle Poppy; her brother-in-law Zeb; her daughter Min Foo and stepdaughters Biddy, Patch, and NoNo (whose real names are Minerva, Bridget, Patricia, and Elinor--and all of whom are indistinguishably overassertive, unhappy, and ungrateful); and to her innumerable grandchildren.<br />Rebecca tries to project her usual front while she ponders where her life took the wrong turn--to her &quot;fake real life, with its tumult of drop-in relatives and party guests and repairmen.&quot; Before she married into the Davitch family, she had been an ambitious undergraduate studying history and dating Will Allenby, a demure young academic. The two of them planned to get married after college and pursue their PhDs. Instead, she met Joe Davitch at a party hosted in his home, and, although he is her senior by thirteen years and the father of three daughters, their ensuing and irreversible relationship becomes the one and only impulsive act she ever commits.<br />While Rebecca imagines her life as it might have been, she continues grudgingly to live the life that is: babysitting her grandchildren, hosting the wedding for one of her daughters, enduring a visit from the snooty mother of her three stepdaughters, planning Poppy's 100-year birthday extravaganza. Like Rebecca herself, the book is often overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters strolling in and out of the house: only the aging Poppy, supportive Zeb, and a surly step-grandson named Peter seem to have discernible personalities, while the rest of the family takes her for granted. Emboldened by a dream, she tries to recapture her lost past and resumes her friendship with Will, only to find that she no longer is the young, serious student of thirty years ago. (Rebecca's candlelight dinner for Will at her home is one of the funniest scenes Tyler has even written.)<br />Some of Tyler's readers fault Rebecca (and, by extension, the author) for not taking charge of life--for being so acquiescent and refusing to alter the inertia causing her dissatisfaction. But that would be a different novel featuring a different character. Throughout, I kept saying to myself &quot;I know this woman!&quot; and the glint of recognition is what resonates with many readers--and, perhaps, annoys others. Rebecca's pivotal journey in life is not the thirty-year adventure that blindly took her where she is, but rather the long-overdue self-exploration of how she got there.akes her for granted.

Unlike nearly all books inspired by movies, however, many readers will find that Clarke's fiction enriches, rather than retreads, familiar ground. In particular, the novel more fully explains the purpose of the monoliths and the movie's ambiguous--and to many, bizarre--ending.<br />Those who complain about the book's datedness win the argument on purely literal grounds. The year 2001 has come and gone, and many of the \\"advances\\" in the book (and the movie) seem quaint, while humanity's adventures in space have, for the most part, stalled.<br />Nevertheless, what is remarkable about Clarke's book is not the technology, which was doomed to obsolescence within a decade, but rather the science. Reading \\"2001\\" reminds us that, while our industrial innovations may have departed from the expectations of the late 1960s, the principles on which our technology is based and the astrophysics that informs our worldview have altered relatively little. Indeed, the novel in many spots reads like a science book, and this impression is underscored by Clarke's journalese, which ranges from informative to didactic. (\\"It was true that the Special Theory of Relativity had proved to be remarkably durable.\\" \\"That pinpoint of incandescence must be a White Dwarf--one of those strange, fierce little stars, no larger than the Earth, yet containing millions of times its mass.\\")<br />Even the attempts at characterization are reportorial: \\"Like all his colleagues, Bowman was unmarried; it was not fair to send family men on a mission of such duration.\\" Heywood Floyd, David Bowman, and even Hal (the mutinous computer) are inarguably one-dimensional. Yet, none of this seems inappropriate, since Clarke--and Kubrick--clearly decided to forego traditional features of storytelling (character, plot, etc.) in favor of pure, extravagant speculation. Instead, Clarke has fully developed his true protagonists: science as a discipline and human progress as a whole.loped his true protagonists: science as a discipline and human progress as a whole.	2004-02-21

Instead, it is a paragon of whatever might be meant by &quot;experimental fiction&quot;: a collection of fabricated book reviews, encyclopedia entries, film proposals, term papers. There are no recurring characters, no plot, and no storyline. This smorgasbord of literary summaries, all without transition or explanation, signifies the debate over the limitless artistic opportunities presented by the potential--and the fragility--of the democratic revolution in Chile in the early 1970s.<br />Dorfman wants to convey the heady diversity that confronted authors under the Allende government: &quot;They are a collective entity, a society of artists that will be able to drain every last drop of what the country is going through, every story, nothing will get away from them.&quot; Although he wrote this book before the Pinochet coup, Dorfman presciently hints at the frailty of the revolution: &quot;a lot of good it'd do us to have a literary renaissance if we ended up without a country.&quot;<br />The result may be, as the author insists in a fictional interview embedded in the book, &quot;a mosaic of Chile, a sample of what had remained outside the book,&quot; but, in fact, the postmodern deliberation eventually drowns out any &quot;attempt&quot; to tell a story. Initially, the reviews and summaries are fairly straightforward; some of the discussions (and the fictional books being discussed) are really quite fascinating, and the diligent reader will be rewarded by rich humor and keen insights. About halfway through, however, the segments and summaries begin interrupting each other and what's being said is entirely subsumed by how it's being said: the form of the debate itself crowds out both the message and the arguments. At a certain point, readers are bound to get &quot;the point,&quot; and then the book begins to try one's patience.<br />A short yet laborious read, and often teetering on the edge of overkill, it all would have probably worked better without so many jump-cuts and with a little less self-indulgence. In the end, though, a sense of sadness pervades &quot;Hard Rain,&quot; since the reader knows (and the author did not) what comes after the deluge.ous read, and often teetering on the edge of overkill, it all would have probably worked better without so many jump-cuts and with a little less self-indulgence.

His futuristic comedy is a satire on the struggle between materialism and environmentalism, each of which he skewers with equally barbed disdain.<br /><br />The narrative skips among three time periods. In the future (2025), global warming and mass extinctions have destabilized the entire globe: hurricane-force rainstorms saturate the California winters, the summers are fiercely hot and dry, and restaurants serve up barely edible dishes (catfish sushi, catfish enchilada, spicy catfish roll, catfish basted in salsa). In the past (late 1980s and early 1990s), Ty Tierwater, his second wife Andrea, and his teenaged daughter Sierra belong to an ecoterrorist group called Earth Forever! And, in the present (turn of the millennium), Sierra spends three years living in an old-growth redwood tree, holding an avaricious logging firm at bay.<br /><br />Underpinning all three sequences is a sometimes moving, often farcical family drama. While Tierwater passes his nights surreptitiously fighting the foes of the global ecology, he spends his days fighting to keep his daughter from the court system, his second wife, and--ultimately--from the very movement to which he belongs.<br /><br />As with any satire, how much you find comic or witty (as opposed to silly or \\"over the top\\") will depend on your own sense of humor. Although the book overall is uneven and its characters often little more than caricatures, some sections read like pages from a thriller--and there are some laugh-out-loud set pieces.<br /><br />Yet those who see this book as a warning against ecological destruction are missing Boyle's point. Although he depicts loggers and government officials as brutal, uncaring, and greedy, the author also treats conservationists quite harshly. (In a telling commentary, Boyle has written that \\"the environmentalists offer us no hope.\\") Tierwater becomes more violent and senseless in planning his vandalism; Andrea sells out to a bureaucracy of ecologists that is more concerned with saving itself than the world; Sierra's \\"martyrdom\\" for the cause is ultimately foolish and pointless. Tierwater himself realizes late in life that, although he may have been \\"right\\" about the coming apocalypse, none of it really matters compared to the destruction wreaked on his family by his beliefs and actions. Furthermore, several of the characters die \\"naturally\\": from a bear, a lion, a bee sting, a meteor. And, finally, the book's most quoted line is certainly its most hostile: \\"To be a friend of the earth, you have to be an enemy of the people.''<br /><br />The problem with this approach, as with many attempts at satire, is that Boyle himself doesn't offer the reader an alternative, or even a sense of direction. Whenever there is a political, social, or global problem, it's all too easy to carp about what we shouldn't do; the hard part is subtly suggesting a better way. I imagine that Boyle--and Tierwater--might respond that the environmentalists (or at least the extremists) need to offer us \\"hope\\" rather than simply threatening us with destruction by their own hands or extinction by natural forces. Still, in spite of its \\"better late than never\\" finale, there's not much hope to be found in this book. Even though it's not meant to be more than a darkly comic satire, the novel conveys too many mixed messages; I think that's why so many readers have misunderstood it as a cautionary tale against global warming. In the end, then, Boyle's beguiling first excursion in dystopian science fiction fails to see the forest for the trees.onmentalists offer us no hope.\\") Tierwater becomes more violent and senseless in planning his vandalism; Andrea sells out to a bureaucracy of ecologists that is more concerned with saving itself than the world; Sierra's \\"martyrdom\\" for the cause is ultimately foolish and pointless.

Monitoring a flood caused by a hurricane, stalking an unwary muskrat, tracking the life cycle of a mantis--little escapes her attention, and she supplements her explorations with fascinating tidbits she has gathered from her readings. Although the book ostensibly cycles through the seasons, from winter through summer and back again, her recollections are randomly presented, if organized very loosely by theme.<br />I'll add my two cents to the Dillard vs. Thoreau debate. While many readers--especially high school students--don't see much of a resemblance (mostly because Dillard is so much easier to read), Dillard herself invites comparison by mentioning Thoreau's work half a dozen times. Her style, like Thoreau's, is informal, and her powers of observation are keen. Yet, in my view, there is one important difference between the two writers: Dillard appears to have no interest with the human issues that preoccupied Thoreau: race relations, political activism, egalitarianism--and even environmentalism. In this book especially, Dillard rarely strays from \\"nature writing,\\" with the exception of a few short passages pondering the role of the \\"creator\\" and the place of humans in the universe and one ill-conceived section in which she mangles quantum physics in metaphorical support of some insights on \\"mysticism.\\"<br />Many readers are enamored by Dillard's prose style, and I will confess to bafflement on this point. All too often, she abandons understated lyricism for Hemingway-inspired simplicity: \\"It is winter proper; the cold weather, such as it is, has come to stay.\\" \\"It is early March.\\" \\"It is spring.\\" \\"Now it is May.\\" \\"It's summer... It's summer now: the heat is on. It's summer now all summer long.\\" \\"In September the birds were quiet.\\" As with Hemingway's work, Dillard's writing can sometimes be elegant in its simplicity, but just as often, I found that she had forsaken the realm of the simple for the simplistic (and even the simple-minded). The paucity of her own prose becomes most apparent when she quotes or paraphrases other authors (such as Edwin Way Teale, whose book on insects provided much of the source material for the mesmerizing episodes in her chapter on \\"Fecundity\\").<br />Dillard confesses that she is \\"not a scientist\\"--and she is certainly not a philosopher. Her abstract musings are unsophisticated; the chapter on \\"The Present,\\" for example, is notable for its fuzziness: \\"What I call innocence is the spirit's unself-conscious state at any moment of pure devotion to any object. It is at once a receptiveness and total concentration.\\" During passages like these, Dillard is no longer serving up pop metaphysics, she's unabashedly belaboring the obvious.<br />More than a few readers and critics have accused Dillard's works of being hollow and pointless, but I'm not sure I would go that far; her books do contain some beautiful and consequential descriptions. Yet, ultimately, it's a matter of taste: I prefer the meatier, methodic, thesis-driven, grounded works of such writers as Rachel Carson, John McPhee, Diane Ackerman, and (yes) Thoreau to Dillard's sauntering diaries.\\"It is early March.\\" \\"It is spring.\\" \\"Now it is May.\\" \\"It's summer...

With his father in prison for insurrectional activity and his diabetic mother gradually losing her grip on sanity, Milan is denied the opportunity of college education and he wanders from job to job--taking work only when the danger of arrest for idleness becomes too great. Under constant police surveillance, he works first as an untrained assistant to neurosurgeons, then as a clerk in a comically undersupplied and overstaffed hardware store, and finally as a nurse's assistant in a maternity ward.<br /><br />Still, amidst the absurdity of totalitarianism, Milan finds splendor and happiness: in Tania, in the woods, in his friends. \\"The fact that we lived in Europe seemed to me beautiful, even though it had to be in a screwed-up country where I felt happy when someone was finally released from prison.\\" In spite of his lack of enthusiasm, Milan tries to find meaning in his employment: \\"Why go to America, when I can find my freedom in Bratislava? Is it not an expression of freedom when you help save someone's life?\\" So he is especially haunted when incompetence, infirmity, or misfortune prevents many of his patients from recovering. The scenes in the operation room, both in the first and last sections of the book, are both enthrallingly lyrical and cringingly graphic. (Full disclosure: I'm the type of wuss who can't even bring himself to watch the surgery scenes during \\"E.R.\\")<br /><br />In this topsy-turvy world, it becomes hard to distinguish between sin and morality, stupidity and reason, innocence and guilt. \\"The more unjust it got, the more innocent and pure I felt, and up to now no one, including myself, has been able to find the tiniest fault with me. Maybe all these people are stupid and the government alone is right. Government employees have always told me that I've gotten what I deserved. . . . Maybe they've seen the future sins of which I'm still unaware.\\" At its heart, \\"The Year of the Frog\\" is a love story against the odds, and, ultimately, Milan refuses to let the futility of his situation overwhelm his feelings for Tania and his desire to live happily. Even after the devastating trauma of the final scene, the love he and Tania have for each other triumphs over the hatred the state has for its citizens.<br /><br />American readers might be perplexed by a few scattered literary allusions and historical references, and occasionally the author seems to sacrifice clarity for overwrought symbolism (and part of the trouble might well be the difficulties inherent in translation--which for the most part is surprisingly fluent). Nevertheless, Simecka's narrative is remarkably accessible, often lighthearted, and earnestly rebellious. The result is a moving tribute to human resilience under inhuman tyranny.e people are stupid and the government alone is right.

Written as a serial for Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1940 and published as a novel in 1946, van Vogt's novel was intended for a mostly teenaged audience. Yet even as pulp fiction for young adults, \\"Slan\\" surpasses other stories from the era for its perceptive racial commentary, reflecting the horrors both of Nazi Germany and of world war.<br />The kernel of the plot revolves around the inexplicable animosity, 1,500 years in the future, between \\"slans\\" (genetic human mutants with two hearts, enhanced physical prowess, and the ability to read minds) and \\"normal\\" humans. The human hatred for slans is clearly a futuristic version of \\"blood libel\\": in the Middle Ages, Jews were falsely accused of reenacting the crucifixion by murdering Christian children; likewise, slans are blamed for harming human children--although the exact nature of the injury and any evidence for its cause remains elusive. The centuries-old mutual fear between slans and humans, then, is fueled more by distrust and difference than by any actual threat.<br />The technology ranges from the prophetic to (of course) the preposterous. The menace of the atomic bomb and the escalating intensity of weaponry haunts the story--and I have to assume that some of these passages were revised for the 1946 novel-length version. (\\"They didn't have his perfect type of atomic energy. Nor was their method a development of the rather superb, so-called atomic bomb of old times, with its heavy water and uranium base, and chain reaction.\\") But much of the science is the stuff of Depression-era comic books: it's hard not to chuckle when, in a pivotal scene, Jommy (the hero) jumps through the opening of a launching spaceship as if it were a passing surfboard.<br />Artistically, the book is a mixed success. Keeping in mind the age group for which it was written, the prose is competent enough. The story itself starts off with a bang--Jommy barely escapes human hunters who mercilessly kill his slan mother--and the first half is a moving bildungsroman of sorts, describing his adventures and emotional growth as he tries to survive in a hostile world. A parallel (and equally involving) story follows Kathleen, a girl slan imprisoned for \\"observation\\" purposes.<br />Yet by the last few chapters, van Vogt seems to abandon his focus on character, psychology, race, and social commentary in favor of the predictable formula his pulp-magazine audience expected from him. (And, as others have noted, the \\"surprise\\" finale is downright silly.) So, it's a mixed treat of a novel: most readers will applaud the daring departures from formula but mourn that, in the end, \\"Slan\\" succumbs to comic-book banality.r />Artistically, the book is a mixed success.

US	41905526	R3MCLG83MCYRZF	0394589149	500118251	Plays Well with Others	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Compelling, witty, poignant--but a little too cute	\\"Plays Well with Others\\" portrays a group of young artists transplanted to New York City, desperately seeking fame and fortune, only to have their careers and lives interrupted by the onset of AIDS. The lead character, Hartley Mims, arrives in 1980; an aspiring writer from North Carolina, he reminds the reader of--well, of Allan Gurganus. Fifteen years later, Hartley writes \\"The Voyage As I Saw It,\\" about his years in New York and the many friends he lost to \\"the plague,\\" and the resulting \\"memoir\\" makes up the entirety of \\"Plays Well with Others.\\"<br /><br />Two other friends--the pretty-boy, wannabe composer Robert Gustafson, and the tomboyish, wannabe artist Angie (Alabama) Byrnes--round out a trio of bohemians in the West Village. Just how much of the biographical detail is truly autobiographical is left to the reader's imagination, but there are many obvious events from Gurganus's life that make their way into the novel and one suspects that this is as much a heartfelt tribute as it is a work of fiction.<br /><br />Composed as a series of vignettes (told more or less linearly), the prose is impressionistic, filled with sentence fragments, puns, catty asides, inverted clauses. When Gurganus is good, he's astonishing: one of the most brilliant chapters recounts the visit of Hartley's parents to his friends' hangout, where his embittered father shatters the joviality with one well-timed sentence. Likewise, the reader experiences the satisfaction of being published for the first time, the torment of waiting for HIV results, the moment when Hartley notices a telltale spot on Robert's arm.<br /><br />Yet, every so often, what is paraded as oh-so-clever authentic vernacular strikes the reader as just-too-cute authorial affectation: \\"Each of us tried on personae like cheap and brilliant store-bought ascots, sometimes a few a day.\\" \\"So, being unrequited love, it was never solitude, more socialism.\\" \\"Do I idealize our early idealism?\\" Similarly, Gurganus's metaphors for AIDS (the sinking of the Titanic, the state of his address book) are initially shrewd and appropriate but eventually exasperating and overwrought. The author just doesn't know where to stop.<br /><br />Even his portrayals are more than a little unreal.

Stephenson has undoubtedly created one of the most intricately designed futureworlds imagined during the last decade, and the plot and characters of \\"The Diamond Age\\" are equally complex. The first forty pages work as a preface of sorts: even though the main character, a petty criminal named Bud, quickly bites the dust, his story sets the scene, introduces elaborate technological advances (nanotech viruses, surgically implanted weapons, and fully--and I mean fully--interactive media), and posits a nightmarish tribal society divided into such \\"claves\\" as the Vickys (or neo-Victorians), Parsis, and Hindustanis.<br />After Bud's trial and gruesome execution, the focus shifts to his daughter Nell. Lord Finkle-McGraw hires John Percival Hackworth, a pseudo-intelligence (A.I.) engineer, to create an interactive primer that will not only teach Finkle-McGraw's granddaugher useful lessons but keep her removed from the \\"degeneracy\\" of society by making her life \\"interesting\\" and \\"subversive.\\" Finkle-McGraw has chosen his engineer all too well, however, and Hackworth performs his own act of subversion: making a duplicate of this book for his own daughter, Fiona. His crime fails when he is mugged and the book falls into Nell's unwary hands by way of her brother Harv, a street tough.<br />The rest of the story intertwines these female-male, daughter-patron strands from three different levels of society: impoverished Nell and Harv (and, later, Constable Moore, a Dickensian father-figure), middle-class Fiona and Hackworth, privileged Elizabeth and Finkle-McGraw, along with an ingenious assortment of supporting characters. There's Judge Fang, a strict by-the-book disciplinarian whose Confucianism allows him a soft spot for the care of children (including Nell); Miranda, the mothering \\"ractor\\" who provides the human voice behind Nell's interactive primer; and Dr. X, an underworld baron whose real allegiances are rarely clear even to his allies (or to the reader). The political and social intrigues greatly enliven Stephenson's philosophical ruminations, and there's too much going on to summarize in any meaningful way.<br />Still, in spite of everything it has going for it, \\"The Diamond Age\\" has its flaws. I enjoyed the first half of the book immensely--it reads almost like a political thriller--but \\"Part the Second\\" falters. Things take a bizarre turn when Hackworth is ensnared by the \\"Drummers,\\" a communalistic underwater tribe that exchanges digital information by collective sexual osmosis. At this point, for my tastes, things get a little too New Age \\"touchy-feely\\" (excuse the double entendre), and the book never entirely recovers.<br />Other readers have noted that the finale is confusing, open-ended, and rushed. (And here I will be careful not to give anything away.) My initial confusion dissipated after I reread the last fifty pages, and the intended ambiguity didn't bother me since I don't mind certain things left to my imagination. Yet it's true that everything is too hastily wrapped up. There are several problems: first, Stephenson is unable to describe adequately a climactic confrontation involving armies consisting of hundreds of thousands of individuals; the mere dozen or so pages he devotes to this war resemble the confusion of a street brawl rather than the chaos of all-out battle. Second, even as he's trying to describe the battle, he's introducing new characters (such as Colonel Spence) right up to the penultimate chapter.<br />Third, and most seriously, although one of the strengths of the first half of the book is its character development, Stephenson pretty much abandons his protagonists and nearly all the supporting roles. Actors enter and leave the stage without rhyme or reason (Judge Fang, so fully developed early in the book, doesn't even appear in the second part). In the end, even Nell, Hackworth, and Miranda become little more than political symbols or plot devices. Adding to this impression: the last pivotal twenty pages are related from the point of view of a heretofore minor character, a strategy that only diminishes the book's emotional impact.<br />Those who expect their books to have satisfying endings, then, might well come away disappointed. I suspect, however, that if you read \\"The Diamond Age\\" knowing that the finale isn't entirely fulfilling, then you'll be able to sit back and enjoy the ingenious ride that makes up most of the book.ages are related from the point of view of a heretofore minor character, a strategy that only diminishes the book's emotional impact.<br />Those who expect their books to have satisfying endings, then, might well come away disappointed.

(The author was also raised on her family's ranch in Chiapas, her brother died young, and she lived a relatively isolated existence under the aloof custody of her father and his overprotective wife.) These chapters introduce the family and the inhabitants of the town of Comitan, as seen through the eyes of the girl, and describe peripherally the ongoing tensions between Mexicans of Spanish descent and those of Indian blood, between the wealthy landowners and the reform government, and between men and women.<br />While the first and third sections carry the emotional weight of the novel, the middle, longest section contains the \\"meat\\" of the plot, told mostly in the third person--although some events are seen from the vantage point of individual characters. The family members travel to their ranch, Chactajal, where the hostilities between opposing social forces finally burst into the open. Goaded by legal reforms introduced by the national government, the Indian workers, almost inevitably, rebel against labor conditions that can be described as close to slavery. Caught in the middle is Felipe, the landowner's illegitimate nephew, whose blood guarantees him certain rights but whose birth prevents him from acquiring any status.<br />Anyone who knows much about the author's political career will understand that her sympathies lie with the Indians (and with the women), yet she masterfully avoids painting either side as entirely virtuous or villainous. On the one hand, some of the Indians stoop to desperate, even criminal, measures to escape their drudgery; on the other hand, even the mule-headed, racist landowner (who, of course, represents the author's father) seems defeated by forces far out of his control. By the end of this sensitive, heartfelt, and melancholy novel, everyone is a victim of the systemic oppression endured by Mexicans of all races and both sexes.ry; on the other hand, even the mule-headed, racist landowner (who, of course, represents the author's father) seems defeated by forces far out of his control.

Reading this book, which relates just one example of the many wrongs endured by the majority of inhabitants of that country, is guaranteed get your blood boiling all over again.<br />Originally published in Australia as &quot;Upington: A Story of Trials and Reconciliation,&quot; Andrea Durbach's book recounts her role as a lawyer in the murder trial of 25 residents of Pabellelo, a black township in Upington, South Africa. After a peaceful meeting in November 1985, during which residents complained about such township conditions as &quot;issues of house rents and the use of alcohol by schoolchildren,&quot; a group of youths made their way to a soccer field, disrupting a game. A confrontation with police ensued, and, for the next three days, local law enforcement clamped down on local unrest, at one point shooting and killing a pregnant woman. Responding to unfounded rumors of an officially sanctioned town-wide gathering, 3,000 inhabitants assembled and were then violently dispersed by police. In the subsequent melee, police fired tear-gas canisters into the crowd. A black police officer, with a past reputation of cruelty and corruption, was flushed from his nearby home and assaulted by a mob, ultimately killing him.<br />Twenty-six residents were arrested. Evidence tied only three or four of them directly to the scene of the crime; five of the accused were actually arrested when they &quot;volunteered&quot; for the lineup and were then selected by alleged eyewitnesses. To avoid the problem of the complete lack of evidence--not to mention the inconvenience of numerous alibis--the Upington 25 (minus one of the accused who pled separately) were tried under the doctrine of &quot;common purpose.&quot; Most frequently used against, say, a group of bank robbers when one of them commits a murder during the course of the crime, the South African justice system extended the doctrine to allow that participation (or even mere attendance) in a crowd is evidence enough for &quot;criminal liability&quot; or &quot;commitment to action&quot; for any illegal acts that might result.<br />Ultimately, all 25 were convicted of murder, 14 of them (including a 60-year-old grandmother) received the death penalty--and the case instantly became an international cause celebre. During the late 1980s through 1991, during the dying days of apartheid, Durbach and her colleagues persisted in battling the outcome of this farcical &quot;show trial.&quot; They, along with the accused, are true heroes against an oppressive system. Still, writing from her new home of Sydney, Australia, Durbach is able to reflect on past events with an admirable mix of sensitivity and detachment.<br />Yet the true villain of the book is Jan Basson, the justice of the Upington Supreme Court who presided over the trial. Although Durbach is remarkably even-handed in her treatment of this rogue, the facts speak for themselves, and the reader closes the book with the belief that there must be a special place in Hell for such callous, mindless tyrants.<br />Even though the trial's outcome and South Africa's destiny is known from the start, &quot;A Common Purpose&quot; is still a page-turner that recommends itself to any reader who cares about racial justice and social democracy.e, the South African justice system extended the doctrine to allow that participation (or even mere attendance) in a crowd is evidence enough for &quot;criminal liability&quot; or &quot;commitment to action&quot; for any illegal acts that might result. <br />Ultimately, all 25 were convicted of murder, 14 of them (including a 60-year-old grandmother) received the death penalty--and the case instantly became an international cause celebre.

Childhood friends, Heed married Christine's grandfather, Bill Cosey, and ever since they've been fighting, first for his love and attention, then for his legacy after he died without a will. They live together, in Cosey's old home, under a fragile and venomous detente: even so, Christine hires a lawyer to regain her inheritance, and Heed employs Junior, a young woman fresh out of a correctional facility, to promote her own nefarious designs.<br />All the characters in the novel orbit around Cosey, the long-dead proprietor of \\"the best and best-known vacation spot for colored folk on the East Coast.\\" The women's neighbor, Sandler, used to be fishing buddies with Cosey, while his wife Vida worked as the hotel receptionist. Their 14-year-old son, Romen, helps Heed and Christine with household errands and is soon seduced by Junior. Informing the narrative with a dispassionate eye is L (Estelle), who worked as the cook at Cosey's resort and who has a few secrets of her own. And a mysterious woman named Celestial haunts the beach and everyone's memories. All their stories--Heed and Christine's, Sandler and Vida's, Junior and Romen's, L and Celestial's--eventually weave together, yet what's fascinating is not simply the resolution of the loose ends and the many mysteries but also how these otherwise intelligent and strong-willed people allow their lives and loves to be dominated and wrecked by one man's weaknesses.<br />Throughout, nothing is quite what it seems. Even the title is ironic--the novel is as much about hate as about love--or, to be more precise, the kind of hatred only love can cause. Heed's and Christine's unbreakable bond is \\"a child's first chosen love. If such children find each other before they know their own sex, or which one of them is starving, which well fed; before they know color from no color, kin from stranger, then they have found a mix of surrender and mutiny they can never live without.\\" And, when that love is shattered, the resulting mix of jealousy and spite is equally invincible: \\"it can kill a life way before it tries to live.\\"<br />Morrison's ability to condense such complex and intricate plots and themes into a 200-page novel should be the envy of most writers--and the joy of any reader.

Likewise, those who read Andy Behrman's best-selling \\"Electroboy\\" might see his clinical diagnoses in a whole new light after reading \\"Addiction by Prescription.\\"<br />All too often, patients place far too much trust in their overworked doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists; take tranquilizers, benzodiazepines, and other mind-altering substances for temporary emotional problems; and ultimately find themselves trapped in a cycle of habit and despair. To make matters worse, many doctors then diagnose their newly addicted patients with clinical psychiatric ailments and minimize or neglect the source of the trouble--the drugs themselves. And, since the 1950s, this problem has disproportionately plagued women, stereotypically regarded as prone to \\"hysteria\\" by their male doctors.<br />Joan Gadsby's book is both a memoir and a book of advocacy. On the latter score, it is a triumph: Gadsby has gathered a mountain of evidence regarding the careless dispensation of drugs, the shady marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies, the undeniable seriousness of the symptoms caused by prolonged use, and the dangers that confront patients who try to discontinue their prescriptions. In the past few years, Gadsby's goal--to publicize the dangers of these drugs--has been made much easier by an avalanche of media attention, but her book is still valuable as a one-stop resource for the layperson looking for information on the topic.<br />As autobiography, however, the book stumbles. There's no arguing with Gadsby's courage or with the misfortune she has endured, and her accounts of drug withdrawal and subsequent legal battles are riveting. Her writing is technically precise, but she's no memoirist. Far too often, her recollections read like excerpts from a resume: \\"I was responsible for managing multi-million dollar budgets and leases, and recommended, directed, and coordinated major capital repair and upgrading projects for many Crown-owned properties.\\" \\"She later moved to the operational side of WCB as director of client services and was responsible for ten area offices throughout British Columbia, traveling extensively.\\" And there's a certain cringe factor when one reads the treacly Rod McKuen-influenced poetry that adorned her refrigerator in times of need--and which she reprints in whole, with lines like \\"When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever\\" and \\"Love yourself first and most.\\" (A few people in situations similar to Gadsby's might find such inspirational material worthwhile, but bad poetry is bad poetry, and there's little benefit for the rest of us.)<br />Fortunately, though, Gadsby sticks mostly to her main themes, and presents a compelling and irrefutable case for the dire situation created by these prescription drugs. Hers is a voice of sanity that should--and must--be heard in order to thwart this legally perpetuated epidemic.ns read like excerpts from a resume: \\"I was responsible for managing multi-million dollar budgets and leases, and recommended, directed, and coordinated major capital repair and upgrading projects for many Crown-owned properties.\\" \\"She later moved to the operational side of WCB as director of client services and was responsible for ten area offices throughout British Columbia, traveling extensively.\\" And there's a certain cringe factor when one reads the treacly Rod McKuen-influenced poetry that adorned her refrigerator in times of need--and which she reprints in whole, with lines like \\"When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever\\" and \\"Love yourself first and most.\\" (A few people in situations similar to Gadsby's might find such inspirational material worthwhile, but bad poetry is bad poetry, and there's little benefit for the rest of us.)<br />Fortunately, though, Gadsby sticks mostly to her main themes, and presents a compelling and irrefutable case for the dire situation created by these prescription drugs.

So this posthumously published survey of Mediterranean history is something of a surprise. While its pages contain expected, brilliant analyses of the geographic factors, commercial considerations, and technological advances that eventually created a politically cohesive if culturally splintered Mediterranean civilization, its final chapters allot noticeable space to the importance of statesmen, philosophers, and artists.<br />Braudel's broad coverage is understandable, given the original design and purpose of the book. Written in the late 1960s, the manuscript was meant as a general survey, the first volume in a cancelled series of illustrated books on the history of the Mediterranean. What's remarkable is how well the book has stood up over time. (A small number of notes correct suppositions since proved inaccurate or incomplete.) What's missing, however, is an appropriate selection of illustrations--and the text was clearly meant to accompany them. Although this edition includes 32 (quite striking) full-color pages of photographs, they are not keyed to the text and many have only tangential connections.<br />\\"Memory and the Mediterranean\\" begins with the archaeological discoveries that inform what we know about the Paleolithic era and the Neolithic civilizations (such as Catal Hoyuk) in the Fertile Cresent. Subsequent chapters discuss Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Crete, before turning to the relatively \\"dark ages\\" of the twelfth through eighth centuries B.C. By incorporating North African and Asian influences, Braudel deliberately moves the center of Mediterranean culture from Europe to where it belongs: in the center of the Mediterranean.<br />Before tackling the Greek \\"miracle\\" and the Roman empire, Braudel examines the Phoenicians, the Etruscans, and Greek colonization in what is unquestionably the best argued, most informative chapter of the book. He ably shows how historical trends--geography, natural disasters, migrations, commerce, maritime advances, science and technology, writing--led to the dominance enjoyed by the Romans in the coastal lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.<br />Yet this dominance was neither inevitable or preordained. While \\"the destiny of Rome is devastatingly simple. . . , people, events and details complicated the story.\\" Braudel balances his own brand of geographic determinism with an acknowledgment of the muscle of Roman imperialism: \\"the very fact that the Mediterranean, while in thrall to Rome, was still a living entity with a healthy pulse of its own, meant that all its cultural goods continued to circulate, mingling ideas and beliefs, and bring about a uniformity in material civilization that has left traces still visible today.\\" The result is a new way of thinking about a Mediterranean culture whose echoes are still seen everywhere.Europe to where it belongs: in the center of the Mediterranean.  <br />Before tackling the Greek \\"miracle\\" and the Roman empire, Braudel examines the Phoenicians, the Etruscans, and Greek colonization in what is unquestionably the best argued, most informative chapter of the book.

Most of the narrative is presented from the perspectives of two women: Stella, a poet married to a Princeton physicist, and Alice, a younger physicist who has an affair first with Stella's husband and then with Stella herself.<br />Presented nonlinearly, it's one of Winterson's more challenging novels, a scrapbook weaving scientific metaphors and cabalistic mysticism with the tangled associations of three generations of three different families. \\"I know I am a fool, trying to make connections out of scraps. . . .  Am I vain enough to assume you will understand me? No. So I go on puzzling over new joints for words, hoping that this time, one piece will slide smooth against the next.\\" Still, a thematically satisfying, often surprising plot emerges from the accumulated snippets of poetry, witticism, and musing. Even though the book's focus is certainly not its plot, all the bits and pieces eventually tie together in satisfying and unexpected ways.<br />If the novel has a shortcoming, it would be the sacrifice of characterization for thematic unity and postmodern cleverness. It's difficult at times to distinguish the two women (surprising in a novel by Winterson) and their family histories, and one is often forced to seek textual clues in order to determine whether the present narrator is the Jewish poet or the British scientist. Occasionally, however, emotions (and especially humor) surface above the ponderous rumination--for example, the &quot;gut&quot;-wrenching chapter in which Stella finds out about her husband's affair and conducts a physics experiment as conceived by an enraged poet: \\"If I drop a CD player and a lap top out of the same window at the same time which one will hit the ground first?\\"<br />\\"Gut Symmetries\\" rewards the persistent reader with memorable passages on love and physics, guilt and energy, poetry and mysticism.

US	41905526	R32WY4LAQ45NIH	0060919949	221336305	Moses, Man of the Mountain	Books	4	13	15	N	N	A witty, accessible retelling of "what Africa sees in Moses"	In the introduction to this 1939 novel, Hurston says that Africans (and, by extension African Americans) revere Moses \\"not because of his beard nor because he brought the laws down from Sinai\\" but \\"because he had the power to go up the mountain and bring them down. . . . [W]ho can talk with God face to face? Who has the power to command God to go to a peak of mountain  and there demand of Him laws with which to govern a nation? . . . That calls for power, and that is what Africa sees in Moses.\\"<br /><br />Hurston incorporates the African tradition into her retelling of the Exodus story, along with that tradition's humor, colloquialisms, wit, irreverence, and apocryphal embellishments. The result is probably her most accessible work, an undemanding read that still reflects a mirror on such issues as politics, slavery, and feminism. The novel is remarkably faithful to the original, but Hurston's Old Testaments heroes and their adversaries are fleshed out as lethargic, selfish, dithering, conniving, as well as joyous, loving, and (above all) human. Moses's brother Aaron and sister Miriam, for example, are depicted as much a hindrance to the movement as a help.<br /><br />Moses himself is presented warts and all. As expected, he's the savior who leads a slave nation from captivity to the freedom of a Promised Land, the wise prophet who brings law and government to an unruly and divided people. Still, Hurston's Moses observes that \\"the first law of Nature is that everybody likes to receive things, but nobody likes to feel grateful. And the very next law is that people talk about tenderness and mercy, but they love force. If you feed a thousand people you are a nice man with suspicious motives. If you kill a thousand you a hero.\\" And Moses does kill--not only Egyptian soldiers hot in pursuit, but 3,000 of his own people: defenseless, drunken revelers paying homage to a golden calf (Exodus 32:28), an unforgiving and ruthless act that never fails to jar modern sensibilities.<br /><br />It's often a marvel when an author can take a well-known story and make it seem fresh. Cecil B. DeMille 1956 movie has heightened modern-day familiarity to the point of farce (although Hurston's original audience was certainly aware of DeMille's first film version, released in 1923). Nevertheless, Hurston manages to make this timeworn story new again for modern readers..<br /><br />It's often a marvel when an author can take a well-known story and make it seem fresh. Cecil B.

A reporter for a tabloid-style news channel, Patrick Wallingford gains international notoriety when he loses his hand to a lion in a videocast that his employer shamelessly milks for ratings. Wallingford then falls in love with the Wisconsin-based widow of the donor whose hand is surgically attached as a replacement, but tension results between his comopolitan world \\"in which sexual anarchy ruled\\" and her relatively chaste, laid-back Green Bay upbringing. And, finally, Irving uses the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr., and the crash of EgyptAir 990 as backdrops for a scathing and contemptuous denunciation of the crisis-driven television news industry.<br />There's also a pleasing and comical subplot about the hand surgeon and his strained relationships with his ex-wife (who loathes him), his son, and his maid. Irving devotes a whole chapter to introducing them, but all the characters involved are entirely forgotten in the last half of the book. They are probably meant to foreshadow Wallingford's own story, but the parallels seem lopsided.<br />Most of the characters display Irving's trademark eccentricities, but none of them fills the role spot on. Simultaneously amiable and thoughtless, Wallingford transforms himself from an empty-headed playboy to a paternal and solicitous gentleman caller, but the metamorphosis seems strained. The reader never quite understands what motivates Doris (often referred to as Mrs. Clausen), the somewhat unemotional and all-too-practical widow. Patrick's conniving, near-hysterical colleague, who wants to have his job and his baby, borders on all-too-familiar sexist stereotype. More than a few additional characters make repeated appearances in the early chapters, only to exit the stage inexplicably well before the final act.<br />In addition, a noticeable number of paragraphs follow a bizarre and cloying pattern: two or three sentences--sometimes non sequiturs--preceding a cute or explanatory parenthetical aside that serves only to describe something that, all too often, should have been mentioned elsewhere.<br />At times it feels that Irving wanted to write a type of fiction different from the farcically Dickensian, three-ring-circus novels to which his readers are accustomed. One can never fault a writer for wanting to branch out--but, in this case, different is not necessarily better. Irving's longer novels can support and sustain his meandering, almost chatty prose style, but this effort's brevity and the plot's sparseness serve to emphasize certain faults. Overall, \\"The Fourth Hand\\" reads a bit like an early draft of a potentially brilliant satirical novel.n sequiturs--preceding a cute or explanatory parenthetical aside that serves only to describe something that, all too often, should have been mentioned elsewhere. <br />At times it feels that Irving wanted to write a type of fiction different from the farcically Dickensian, three-ring-circus novels to which his readers are accustomed.

US	41905526	R1GTBEHFM2ZGMQ	0312850581	216137473	Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Provocative, challenging, fun--but admittedly unrealistic	Card is famous for weaving fascinating metaphysical and philosophical questions into page-turning narratives. He strikes again with &quot;Pastwatch,&quot; a time-travel novel that imagines how the world might be different if we could make small changes to significant historical events. We've all considered how much better our lives might be if, when we were younger, we knew what we know now. Card applies this idea on a macrocosmic scale, imagining what the world would be like if we could introduce twentieth-century sensibilities into the minds of sixteenth-century people.<br />In a not-too-distant future, the survivors of a near-apocalypse develop a technology that allows them to observe the past and to record historical events for posterity. Tagiri, her daughter Diko, and several friends and coworkers become obsessed with Columbus's voyage to America. While acknowledging his genius as an individual, they deplore the unintended (and intended) consequences: genocide, slavery, ecological destruction. After realizing that it is possible to convey information to the past, they attempt to stymie Columbus's success.<br />If you're expecting a work of historical fiction, &quot;Pastwatch&quot; isn't a book for you. While Card's fictional characters consider and discard a number of obvious objections to each historical speculation, readers can still find fault with certain specifics of Card's historical, scientific, and anthropological assumptions. The Atlantis myth, for example, is supported by evidence that has been thoroughly discounted by Rhys Carpenter and other historians.<br />It's equally implausible that a resurgent Tlaxcalan empire could have invaded and conquered Europe if Columbus hadn't traveled to America first. While considering this idea, the novel's heroes compare the epidemics that wiped out Native Americans to the occasional plagues that visited Europe. Noting that &quot;not one nation in Europe fell because of these plagues,&quot; they determine that an American empire would have been able to survive as well. But the two situations are not remotely comparable: Europe had the luxury of dealing with one disease at a time, while several major epidemics struck America simultaneously and obliterated as much as 80% of the population (and entire communities). Furthermore, an invading army hit by such devastation would hardly be in any shape to conquer overseas territories.<br />Yet Card doesn't really get bogged down with all the &quot;what ifs.&quot; He's much more interested in &quot;if only...&quot; I don't think he's expecting his readers to believe as much as he's challenging us to think. His novel compares civilization's evil elements (e.g., New World human sacrifice versus Old World slavery) and imagines what the world would be like if, for instance, Christians had behaved as their theology suggests. While neither preachy nor &quot;politically correct,&quot; this is in fact a deeply religious novel. Like the best works of science fiction, &quot;Pastwatch&quot; considers some difficult human questions and wraps them in an electrifying story.American empire would have been able to survive as well.

A history of zero and nothingness from the Greeks to the nineteenth century precedes a chapter on mathematical concepts, three chapters on physics (fields, quantum theory, spacetime, black holes, string theory), and two chapters on cosmology (big bang, inflation, the cosmological constant, repulsive force). The penultimate chapter, on how visual perception and psychological factors influence the concepts of nothingness, seems noticeably out of place.<br />Yet this outline of the book is deceptive, since the vaguely structured chapters seldom confine themselves to the topics at hand. A lack of transitions, a fondness for rhetorical questions, and an excess of tangents further confuse Cole's rambling banter. A symptom of the book's lack of organization is the unjustifiable frequency with which the author interjects that there will be &quot;more on this topic later.&quot;<br />And then there are the puns. In spite of the author's preemptive reassurance to the contrary, there are so many quips along the lines of the one I've used to title this review that it's occasionally difficult to know how seriously a statement or observation is meant. Cole is quite capable of hitting her targets: there are a number of mind-expanding images, genuine bursts of witticism, and sharply described concepts, but, just as often, the discussion falters in linguistic limbo. Granted, Cole has an unenviable task, since even scientists haven't yet developed the language to discuss many of the concepts she describes, but her prose isn't aided by the preference for clever wordplay and winking asides over straightforward exposition and unambiguous definitions.<br />The book is not entirely without merit; one's reaction will surely depend on one's interests and background. Some readers, especially those who enjoy works of popular metaphysics, might regard the ideas presented here as mind-expanding, even satisfying, but fans of science writing are likely to be disappointed. Those readers should investigate instead the significant number of books listed in Cole's bibliography, most of which discuss these topics far more clearly.sharply described concepts, but, just as often, the discussion falters in linguistic limbo.

North Carolina in the early 1980s is re-invented as a place where gay surfers and jocks comfortably refer to themselves as \\"queers,\\" where HIV test results are available overnight, where the attractive straight men are assertively bisexual, and where the gravest threats to a gay man are a lack of trust in oneself and a head injury from a storm-tossed surfboard. Within these surroundings, the author follows the exploits of Matt as he comes to terms with his sexuality and insinuates himself into an informal gay family (complete with children). At times, the atmosphere seems more appropriate for an exercise in wishful thinking than a realistic portrayal of gay life in a small Southern beach resort twenty years ago.<br />Like many novels in this genre, \\"Metes and Bounds\\" contains a number of explicit (yet rather pedestrian) sexual escapades strung together by occasionally successful depictions of the novel's characters. Matt himself, however, is disappointingly nondescript, in spite of his angst-ridden introspection; Quinn is not polished enough to give his protagonist a voice worthy of his own narrative. Rather than replicate an authentic vernacular, the first-person perspective seems designed to disguise shoddy writing.<br />Quinn is especially prone to the annoying and repetitive use of certain words and expressions, sometimes within the same paragraph or even sentence. For example, he has an odd affinity for the word \\"grin\\": \\"I started grinning,\\" \\"I couldn't stop grinning,\\" \\"Tiger said, grinning back,\\" \\"he looked at me grinning\\"--and that's just on pages 121-122.<br />Except for a few surfing metaphors, there's really nothing to distinguish this novel from the hundreds of other gay coming-of-age novels. Regardless of its rather ham-fisted use of flashbacks (designed, I suppose, to shroud secrets that are never that surprising), the book settles within a foreseeable range of emotions and events. Quinn maintains a wishful (and wistful) romanticism throughout--until the very last page, when a \\"grinning\\" jock reaches for Matt.otions and events.

A perfidious coquette, Ramona keeps lovers only as long as they are able to give her exactly what she desires--which is seldom longer than a day. Her misdeeds result in exile to Naples, where she schemes to become a world-class opera diva--in spite of her ear-shattering vocal limitations. Eventually, her scent (like beauty) vanishes, and she loses her primacy to the daughter she despises.<br />In spite of its numerous sexual references and innuendoes, \\"Nectar\\" is more impish than pornographic. The story goes down easily and, depending on how much one appreciates sheer silliness, it is often quite funny--although, admittedly, it rarely transcends the genre of \\"guilty pleasure.\\" In fact, it's not an easy book to categorize: unlike a fable or fairy tale, it has no moral; if it is meant as a satire, the object of ridicule (beauty? fashion? narcissism?) is lost on me. Instead, the book seems a blend of camp and ribaldry--Chaucer Extra Lite, if you will.	2003-10-26

He packs an adventure tale, a drawing room comedy, and a social satire in a book no longer than a novella.<br />Everyone knows the basic plot, in which the unnamed Time Traveller races to the year 802,701 and discovers that the human species has split into two: the simple-minded and dependent Eloi, who live on the surface of the planet, and the sinister Morlocks, who keep the planet running from caves while caring for the Eloi exactly as a farmer tends to a herd of cows, supplying them with their basic needs before harvesting them.<br />What may be less familiar to today's readers is Wells's sociological commentary, a morbid version of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs.\\" The aboveground (upstairs) Eloi represent the pampered gentry, while the underground (downstairs) Morlocks are the descendants of the servile classes. Readers may think that Wells is portraying the Morlocks as evil incarnate and the Eloi as \\"innocent\\" victims, but he is actually condemning the human propensity to create such divisions at all. Both sides share the ultimate responsibility for the way things turn out, and the author's contemporaries, both master and servant, surely found the possibility of being either eaten or eater equally loathsome.<br />\\"The Time Machine\\" has proved a major influence on subsequent works of literature. Yet , in addition to being a seminal work of science fiction, it still can be read as a warning against the evils of class warfare.	2003-10-20
US	41905526	RNREJA3ZNBJHV	0380973650	337033298	American Gods	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	Fantasy noir, mystery thriller, social satire, and more	\\"American Gods\\" is an interesting hybrid: fantasy by way of mythology, mystery thriller in the noir tradition, cultural and religious satire, and more. The risk any author takes in writing such a book is that devotees of each genre will protest the bastardization. Witness the scores of disappointed readers drawn to the book by the Hugo Award, who may have expected swordfights, elves, and aliens. Similarly, fans of Thomas Pynchon, who even gets an honorable nod in the book, may find Gaiman's noir style too lowbrow for their tastes, while readers of detective fiction may be repulsed by the book's supernatural elements.<br />I think, however, that the book will fascinate and intrigue readers who dabble across the various genres to which Gaiman pays homage. The premise is inspired: the old gods brought to America by generations of arriving populations (from Native Americans to recent immigrants) have been rendered nearly moot and powerless by modern infatuation with the new gods--telephony, the Internet, transportation, television, etc. The two camps prepare for a final battle, and Shadow, still traumatized by his wife's betrayal and death, finds himself bafflingly caught up in the war plans.<br />In an allegory, characterization is probably beside the point, but Gaiman still manages to infuse the imported gods with enough traits to make them distinctive and, more important, identifiable to anyone with a passing knowledge of mythology. He resurrects a few gods or legends who are so esoteric and forgotten that they survive as faint echoes of their former selves or, like the poor Queen of Sheba (remember her?), they meet an early demise. The new gods, just as appropriately, are as faceless, fleeting, and frivolous as the technologies they represent. Not a few readers have objected that Christianity gets barely a mention, but they've missed the book's most cleverly \\"hidden Indian\\": Shadow himself is the messiah-figure. The most obvious parallels are placed early on--he's in his early 30s, he's spent three years in the desert (prison) before embarking on his reluctant mission--and the parallels only multiply as the book progresses in ways I can't fairly divulge. (Watch for the role the goddess Easter plays in the book's climax.)<br />Gaiman has a droll, dark sense of humor that livens up his prose. Along the way, he also effortlessly plants so many loose ends and subtle intimations that he surprises the reader with unexpected twists and forehead-slapping resolutions even after the main action of the book seems to have wound down. Like Shadow performing his coin tricks, Gaiman repeatedly distracts the reader with \\"obvious\\" revelations, only to unveil a secret hidden in the other hand.<br />The story moves along so briskly, so imaginatively, and so wittily, that I raced through several sections, but the more I think about \\"American Gods,\\" the more I realize I missed. I'll be pulling this one down from the shelf for a second stab in a couple of years.in his early 30s, he's spent three years in the desert (prison) before embarking on his reluctant mission--and the parallels only multiply as the book progresses in ways I can't fairly divulge.

He's at his best when he's discussing historical subjects, such as Thomas Edison's flirtations with the occult, Isaac Newton's passion for alchemy, H. G. Well's predictions for the twentieth century, or the scriptural and literary foundations for the legend of the Wandering Jew. Also interesting are his essays on more obscure topics, especially when he provides detailed technical background and biographical information: Farrakhan's bizarre fascination with the number \\"19,\\" Harold Puthoff's sham research on zero-point energy, and the hilarious egg-balancing hoax peddled by Donna Henes and other charlatans to a gullible media.<br />Gardner has little new to say in his essays on newsworthy topics from recent years--creationism, Freudian theory, the Alan Sokal hoax, Heaven's Gate, and Jean Houston (the channeler briefly consulted by Hillary Clinton)--although Gardner does say it with his trademark scorn and humor. Two exceptions are the essay on the late Senator Claiborne Pell's support for paranormal research (New Age pork I bet most of his constituents didn't know about) and the eye-opening chapter about Temple University's \\"Center for Frontier Sciences,\\" an \\"academic\\" department that should embarrass students, faculty, and alumni alike.<br />Not a few readers have complained that, in some cases, Gardner doesn't provide enough science to disprove the topic at hand, or that he's too busy ridiculing rather than rebutting. There is some truth to this accusation: these articles were originally written for readers of \\"The Skeptical Inquirer,\\" and Gardner doesn't revise them for a more general audience. Some subjects, however, are so far out there that it's futile even to attempt a \\"scientific\\" refutation: where does one even begin, for example, to attempt to discredit the farcical \\"anthropology\\" taught by the disciples of Carlos Castaneda? The type of person to believe this type of hokum certainly won't be persuaded by a more systematic debunking--and probably couldn't be convinced to read this book in the first place. Gardner settles for reporting on these movements rather than engaging with them, to the delight of skeptics everywhere.e that it's futile even to attempt a \\"scientific\\" refutation: where does one even begin, for example, to attempt to discredit the farcical \\"anthropology\\" taught by the disciples of Carlos Castaneda?

Cather herself agreed with the assessment offered by one of her contemporary reviewers: &quot;there is the steady rhythm of the fundamental hatred of the sexes one of the other and their irresistible attraction one of the other.&quot;<br />The young and idealistic Nelly Birdseye describes the marriage of Myra Driscoll, her aunt's friend, to Oswald Henshawe. Their elopement incites Myra's uncle to disown her from a considerable inheritance, and the couple alternates between mutual bliss and impoverished misery. The fragility of their relationship is further imperiled by Myra's materialism and jealousy and Oswald's indolence and philandering.<br />&quot;My Mortal Enemy&quot; is, perhaps, one of Cather's most misunderstood novels, and the author seems to have intended that the title's meaning remain ambiguous. Most readers will assume, quite reasonably, that the &quot;mortal enemy&quot; who inflames Myra's inevitable disillusionment is Myra herself, and the text certainly supports such a reading. Yet in correspondence to friends and other writers, Cather admitted that she &quot;had a premonition . . . most people wouldn't [understand]&quot; that Myra's &quot;mortal enemy&quot; was Oswald, since he could never satisfy the excessiveness of her devotion, both to him and to others.<br />Although framed by the sparsest detail to be found in Cather's fiction, the story's forlorn perspective and memorable characterizations make this one of her most powerful works.	2003-10-12

(I hadn't read any other novels by Byatt, and I dove right into this one.) This entry has been described as a novel of the Sixties, but such a characterization is misleading. Byatt never really leaves the ivory tower: the turbulence of the streets, the counterculture, the mod scene, the social upheavals all remain on the periphery throughout. The novel depicts more calm than storm, exploring instead the far narrower (but still interesting) milieu of the literati.<br /><br />Byatt presents two parallel plots. After the death of her sister, Frederica (the subject of all four novels) is trapped in a marriage that quickly seems unsuitable, eventually becomes oppressive, and finally turns violent. Since it's 1964, a divorce is not simply for the asking; after escaping with her son, she finds her suitability as a mother on trial (both literally and figuratively). The scenes describing the spousal abuse are among the most harrowing I've read, even though, compared with similar episodes in other works, the horror is more psychologically distressing than physically violent. Byatt explicitly links Frederica's subsequent emotional and legal ordeal with Lady Chatterley's trial (both of the book and of the character); Frederica represents a late-twentieth-century woman judged by lingering puritanical nineteenth-century standards.<br /><br />The second story concerns a thematically similar trial: the ban of &#34;Babbeltower,&#34; a book recommended to a publisher by Frederica that is subsequently deemed pornographic by the British government. Tame by today's standards (and even when compared to &#34;Last Exit to Brooklyn,&#34; which served as Byatt's model), this fable portrays a sexually uninhibited utopia that evolves into a masochistic and totalitarian dystopia. The recently concluded obscenity trial of &#34;Lady Chatterley's Lover&#34; lingers in the background, although the prosecution asserts that &#34;it was Lady Chatterley herself who was on trial, for the fact of her sexuality. In the case of 'Babbeltower' it is the prisoner in the dock who is on trial, his imagination, the world he created, the tendency of the messages he offers.&#34;<br /><br />While &#34;Babel Tower&#34; is often riveting and stimulating, if Byatt herself were on trial, she might be found guilty of excess. Byatt's most obvious mentor is Iris Murdoch, whose influence she confirms in both the text and the acknowledgments. Murdoch, however, doesn't always spell out her many cultural, philosophical, and literary references; she leaves it for the reader to discover or disregard. Byatt, in contrast, seems to believe that her audience is not well-read; she assumes the role of literary critic for her own work. Her characters quote a dizzying parade of passages to each other, to themselves, or to the reader. Sometimes this approach works, but the technique reaches its nadir when she reprints Frederica's scrapbook, a collage of excerpts and scrambled texts (which Frederica herself correctly disparages as unsatisfying and incoherent). There's also a bizarre and not entirely satisfying subplot which evokes Cronenberg's &#34;Dead Ringers&#34; but can't match its creepiness; it involves identical twins, one of whom courts Frederica, while the other is a jealous psychopath.<br /><br />Despite these excesses, Byatt still succeeds with her portrait of the young woman artist whose confusion is aggravated by clashes between desires and expectations, nonconformity and morality, literature and society.ugh the prosecution asserts that &#34;it was Lady Chatterley herself who was on trial, for the fact of her sexuality.

It's the intellectual's ultimate &quot;what I did on my summer vacation&quot; essay, written for friends as a gift to accompany their excursions through France. The first half is a highly personal travel book and an idiosyncratic guide to art and architecture of medieval French cathedrals (particularly of Chartres); the last six chapters offer a succinct excursion through the spiritual mindset of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />If you've never been to Mont Saint Michel or to Chartres, the first ten chapters can be hard going; it's like reading a 250-page description of a painting you've never seen. Even if you have been to both locations, it's unlikely you'll remember the details Adams expected his readers to have in front of them. Fortunately, his prose is not dry (and is at times characteristically witty). Adams is able to render vividly the fleches, the portals, the arches, the statues, and the stained glass panels, and he provides the tourist with a thorough understanding of the achievement represented by medieval religious art. He also supplies as background a wealth of related literary and historical references .<br />The tenth chapter (and the last of Adams's official &quot;tour&quot;) focuses less on the cathedral of Chartres itself and more on the cult of the Virgin that it represents. It serves as a segue to the second half of the book, which will be far more accessible to general readers. He compares contemporary portrayals of three queens--Eleanor of Guienne (Aquitaine), Blanche of Castile, and Mary of Champagne (who wasn't really a queen, but never mind)--to the representations of the Virgin Mary in the art, in poetry, and in hagiography. &quot;The Virgin was a real person, whose tastes, wishes, instincts, passions, were intimately known,&quot; Adams argues. &quot;Like other Queens, she had many of the failings and prejudices of her humanity.&quot; The final three chapters turn to the intellectual life: the ongoing tensions between universalism and nominalism, Bernard and Abelard, mysticism and rationalism--all culminating in the balancing act of Thomas Aquinas.<br /><br />Over 75 years ago the &quot;Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot; judged Adams's book as &quot;probably the best expression of the spirit of the Middle Ages.&quot; Well, not quite; such a view could be proffered by a literary critic perhaps, but certainly not by a historian, and I think Adams himself would have been appalled by such a statement.

US	41905526	R2WQUZ9VTS66TE	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	3	581	682	N	N	Exciting (if gruesome) story in shallow theological waters	This work of fiction has two distinct aspects, either of which has the potential to be relished for its own sake. On the one hand, it's a grim adventure story about an adolescent shipwreck survivor. On the other, it's a fable with overt religious overtones and a Message.<br /><br />And what a premise for a story!  A young boy trapped on a lifeboat with the oddest assort of castaways in literary history: a zebra, hyena, orangutan, and a Bengal tiger. The result is an enjoyable, brisk, nearly believable, often gruesome romp, in straightforward (but never pedestrian) writing style equal to the best \\"young adult\\" fiction available today. The first section introduces Pi living in India with his zoo-keeping family. Part horror story, part fable, the major portion of the book recounts his (mis)adventures at sea. It's the final pages that throw readers for a loop, as the story steers from magic realism to a post-modern finale in which Martel tries to wrap up his point.<br /><br />While the plot will remind readers of \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" and even \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" the thematic underpinnings of the book, unfortunately, flirts with the \\"feel good,\\" New-Age banality of \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull.\\" Some readers might find the ideas worth contemplating, but I suspect an equal number will realize that Martel's message disintegrates after serious reflection. These faults deserve discussion, but I will avoid disclosing any of the plot's surprises.<br /><br />Some of the book's metaphysical elements rise to the challenge, especially when Martel approaches the subject with a sense of humor. But the basic argument is rather trite, and the author stumbles when he offers an alternative explanation for Pi's experiences--a story that is cynical and stark and a lot more realistic--and then challenges the reader to choose: the \\"better story, the story with animals\\" or \\"the story that will confirm what you already know.\\" Martel's Big Message: Faith in God is belief in \\"the better story\\"; atheism is picking the story you already know, and agnosticism is refusing to choose.<br /><br />The most obvious flaw in this line of reasoning is that Martel has set up a false dichotomy: believers can choose from hundreds of \\"possible\\" stories for any narrative--not just two. The second problem is sheer chutzpah: The \\"god\\" of this story is the Author, not God, and its world is entirely the Author's Creation. There's no way around the fact that Martel, in effect, compares belief in fiction to belief in God. Furthermore, if we believed in every story because it was better or prettier, many of us would still \\"believe\\" in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, or Zeus and Hera, or Alice and the Mad Hatter. A third, related issue: since the author invents the story, he is able to manipulate the reader. Another author/god writing this book could easily turn the tables, ending the book with Pi committed to an asylum, unable to care for himself, and uselessly babbling his story to his caretakers. Which is the \\"better story\\" then?<br /><br />And that leads to the novel's biggest failing:  Martel never convinces the reader why it's important to choose at all. The book is less a brief for belief in God than a denunciation of agnosticism. In press interviews, for example, Martel exposes his own prejudices, referring to agnostics as \\"doubters\\" or \\"fence-sitters,\\" and that he has greater respect for atheists. Pi argues similarly in the novel, \\"To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\" Yet this metaphor makes no sense: one doesn't always have to be on the move or even commit to a single mode of transportation. If life presents hundreds of possible stories, why must we choose one (or even a few) to the exclusion of all others? Or, as an agnostic might ask, why not remain open-minded rather than close-minded?<br /><br />Nevertheless, the reader who finds Martel's philosophical ramblings unappealing or incoherent or unsatisfying or shallow (or all of the above) can still sit back and take pleasure in the story. For all its theological misfires, \\"Life of Pi\\" might yet join a tradition of works (like, say, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" or \\"The Fountainhead\\") that stand on their own for many readers, regardless of what they might think of their underlying themes.amblings unappealing or incoherent or unsatisfying or shallow (or all of the above) can still sit back and take pleasure in the story.

US	41905526	R2WCO84QX7NTQO	0312276699	374132639	War Without End: Israelis, Palestinians, and the Struggle for a Promised Land	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Opinionated yet valuable history of 20th-century Palestine	A combination of history and journalism, La Guardia's useful and readable book covers the formation of Israel, its recently immigrated Jewish populations, and the exiled or (to risk a loaded word) subjugated, mostly Islamic, Arab natives. While the book sketches the historical events of the last two millennia that led the world to the current impasse and describes the rise of Zionism and its role in the creation of the state, the bulk of its pages focuses on events since 1948.<br />Discussion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become so heated that it is surely impossible to write a book that would satisfy even a plurality of readers, much less most of them. La Guardia is not impartial: on the whole, his sympathies tend to lie with the plight of the Palestinians (and part of this bias may well be unavoidable, considering the disadvantaged David vs. well-armed Goliath nature of the conflict). Yet he also understands the motives, emotions, and events that supported both Zionism and the formation of a Jewish state early in the first half of the twentieth century.<br />His blunt criticisms are equally harsh, directed at the international blindness that seemingly pretended that Palestine was an empty territory before and especially after World War 2, the incendiary Israeli policy of permitting settlements amidst Palestinian territory, the anti-Semitism tainting the Palestinian cause, the intractable religious fanaticism that infects both sides. Furthermore, he is scathing in his criticism of both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. For example, he excoriates Arafat's cynical manipulations, his administration of &quot;a fiefdom in his own image,&quot; and his &quot;laissez-faire attitude&quot; to Palestinian violence. Similarly, he disparages Sharon for his role in the Phalangist massacre of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Although extremists of either stripe will undoubtedly disagree, La Guardia's biases inform rather than contaminate his reporting.<br />The journalistic aspects of the book yield its one major shortcoming. Instead of presenting the history of Palestine/Israel in some linear fashion, his chapters divide his materials, very loosely, into a potpourri of overlapping topics: religious background, the early immigrations and kibbutzim, a history of twentieth century events, the shadow of the Holocaust and the creation of the Palestinian diaspora (provocatively titled &quot;Victims of Victims&quot;), the assorted native and immigrant Jewish communities, and recent political events. La Guardia mixes interviews, historical narration, and flashbacks; since he occasionally refers to people and events before he's introduced them, the result may well be confusing to those who don't already have a general historical background.<br />Written by a foreign observer with an impressive understanding of the Middle East, &quot;War without End&quot; is, for the most part, factually reliable--and the opinionated presentation of those facts will enlighten rather than prejudice. The reader closes the book, however, with a sinking pessimism reinforced by the book's title: that this morass really has no solution that we can expect to see in our lifetimes.nalistic aspects of the book yield its one major shortcoming.

One problem is the book's organization. Teresi divides his discussion into distinctions that were unknown a few centuries ago--mathematics, astronomy, cosmology, physics, geology, chemistry, and technology--and then divides each of these chapters by localities. As a result, the book has little narrative flow and makes for some awfully dry reading--the type of disconnected paragraphs one usually finds in textbooks or reference works. I found it difficult to read this book for more than a few pages at a stretch.<br />Furthermore, since modern scientific specialties were, of course, unknown to ancient investigators, his categorization results in some odd choices. For example, beliefs concerning the shape of the earth (round, flat, or square) are discussed in geology as well as cosmology. Similarly, he arbitrarily divides up the work of alchemists among several chapters. Since ancient and medieval studies span many disciplines, there is a lot of annoying (and often verbatim) repetition: we read about the yin-yang duality and ch'i in the sections on astronomy, physics, geology, and chemistry; about Jainism with regards to cosmology, physics, and chemistry; and how Avicenna influenced physics, geology, and chemistry.<br />Teresi was cofounder of Omni Magazine, which had a reputation (some might call it notoriety) for including articles on topics that strayed well beyond science and into paranormal exploration and New Age quackery. Although &quot;Lost Discoveries&quot; is usually on firmer scientific ground, the author occasionally recalls his earlier career with an eager enthusiasm to find direct or symbolic connections between ancient learning and modern scientific investigation. This is particularly true in his chapter on cosmology. (Teresi's obvious distaste for Big Bang theory doesn't help here.) The Mangaian creation myth, describing an infant universe emerging from a coconut root, may offer interesting literary and cultural insights, but it in no way &quot;anticipates&quot; modern cosmological theories of an inflationary universe. Elsewhere, it's simply preposterous to find intimations of quantum theory in the ancient Indian &quot;yadrccha&quot; (chance) or of the Higgs field in the Buddhist &quot;maya&quot; (the weight of the universe). One may as well argue that William Bennett is a quantum physicist every time he walks into a casino.<br />It's too bad that Teresi didn't organize his research by civilization and time period, compare these societies on their own terms (rather than ours), chart their influences on each other and on subsequent cultures, and avoid misguided attempts to find inklings of 21st-century theories and knowledge in every ancient myth. Readers looking for a stronger investigation of the wonders of non-Western science, technology, and civilization should check out Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; or Felipe Fernandez-Armesto's &quot;Civilizations.&quot;sics, geology, and chemistry; about Jainism with regards to cosmology, physics, and chemistry; and how Avicenna influenced physics, geology, and chemistry.<br />Teresi was cofounder of Omni Magazine, which had a reputation (some might call it notoriety) for including articles on topics that strayed well beyond science and into paranormal exploration and New Age quackery.

Like all heated arguments, this pamphlet is meant to get the blood boiling, and its anger and righteousness (and humor) make it far more readable than most of the writings by the nation's others founders.<br />Paine starts with a theory of government and an examination of the moral and political deficiencies of the constitutional monarchy practiced in England. He then proceeds to eviscerate the very idea of monarchy, detailing biblical prescriptions against it (as a response to the concept of the &quot;divine right&quot; of kings) and exposing the very silliness of hereditary kingship as a form of government. While perhaps &quot;the present race of kings in the world have had an honorable origin,&quot; in all probability &quot;the first of them [was] nothing better than the principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage manners or pre-eminence in subtility obtained him the title of chief among plunderers.&quot;<br />He follows this theoretical background with a summary of the ongoing struggle between the colonies and Britain, followed by an outline of proposals for what form an American government might take. Paine then asserts that &quot;a separation between the countries [will] take place at one time or another&quot; and details the advantages--military, economic, and political--that independence will bring. In an appendix, he argues against the futility of any attempt at reconciliation with the British monarchy.<br />At the end is attached a strongly worded response to a pamphlet written by John Pemberton on behalf of the Quaker community and opposed to military rebellion. Paine argues that thinly guised neutrality in the name of &quot;peace&quot; is little more than implicit support for military activities by royalist forces, a theme he returns to in the second issue of &quot;The American Crisis.&quot;  There, he points out that Quaker leaders &quot;are continually harping on the great sin of our bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay waste the world in blood and famine, and they, poor fallen souls, have nothing to say.&quot; Yet, aware perhaps that he may be accused of bigotry, he carefully qualifies this argument in a footnote: &quot;I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies of men. . . . We are certain we have many friends among [the Quakers], and wish to know them.&quot;<br />Paine's parting statement to the Quakers should be required reading for every citizen: &quot;Sincerely wishing, that as men and christians, ye may always fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right; and be, in your turn, the means of securing it to others; but that the example which ye have unwisely set, of mingling religion with politics, may be disavowed and reprobated by every inhabitant of America.&quot;;The American Crisis.&quot;  There, he points out that Quaker leaders &quot;are continually harping on the great sin of our bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay waste the world in blood and famine, and they, poor fallen souls, have nothing to say.&quot; Yet, aware perhaps that he may be accused of bigotry, he carefully qualifies this argument in a footnote: &quot;I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies of men. . . .

US	41905526	RTDGUEQ3NWNW4	0393317552	733405472	Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies	Books	5	11	13	N	Y	Brilliant, eclectic panorama of the past 13,000 years	This intriguing and expansive book gathers knowledge from a number of fields (archaeology, anthropology, ecology, evolutionary biology, horticulture, and more). Its novelty is not in the details, any of which can be found in other books, but in the synthesis of 13,000 years' worth of human history. Diamond argues that many (but not all) of \\"the striking differences between the long-term histories of peoples of the different continents have been due not to innate differences in the people themselves but to differences in their environments.\\"<br />Diamond covers so much material that any attempt at summary would be imprecise. The sections I found most compelling dealt with agriculture and animal husbandry--two topics that would have probably induced sleep if covered by another author. For example, he presents the fascinating background that the dominant five \\"large\\" domesticated mammals--sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and horses--originated in central Eurasia (and that no easily domesticated, large mammals were available, for example, to North Americans or Australians); that these animals include the world's only widespread \\"beasts of burden,\\" giving their human handlers additional advantages in mobility and farming; and that most of the world's lethal diseases resulted from proximity to the barnyard, gradually providing Eurasians with immunity to illnesses that later wiped out entire societies upon first exposure. The minor mammals (camels, llamas, reindeer) were too limited by geography and climate to affect the course of history outside their confines. As for zebras, bears, giraffes, tigers, hippos--to this day, nobody has been able to domesticate them. While this seems intuitively obvious, no writer has so clearly and irrefutably connected the dots, showing how access to these animals gave early chiefdoms an insurmountable advantage over those human societies without them and allowed them to develop surpluses and commerce that supported the world's most enduring civilizations.<br />Comments made by the author's critics, while few in number, nearly prevented me from reading this book and need to be addressed so other readers won't be similarly discouraged. A few readers seem offended by Diamond's self-mocking and somewhat tongue-in-cheek assertion (in the Introduction) that the natives of New Guinea have certain advantages that make them arguably more \\"intelligent.\\" Yet these commentators are willfully ignoring the context: Diamond admits that \\"New Guineans tend to perform poorly at tasks that Westerners have been trained to perform since childhood,\\" yet he is quite aware of how \\"stupid I look to New Guineans when I'm with them in the jungle.\\" That is, if one defines \\"intelligence\\" not as the knowledge needed to use a computer or write a book review but, rather, as the ability to survive in the wild (\\"following a jungle trail\\" or identifying poisonous mushrooms, to cite two of the author's examples), then the New Guineans win hands down. To make a similarly lighthearted argument: when the house of cards we call \\"civilization\\" is threatened by the least misfortune (economic recession, power blackout, bad weather, the death of a British princess), a frightening number of otherwise \\"intelligent\\" people, instead of relying on their wits and survival skills, rush straight for their therapists.<br />Likewise, anyone who accuses Diamond of \\"geographic determinism\\" cannot have read the epilogue, in which he clearly rejects such an extreme position. He admits that individuals and cultures--and, for that matter, pure chance--can also influence history, but \\"that some environments provide more starting materials, and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions, then do other environments.\\" The author's argument is unambiguous: while culture, as well as individual inventors and rulers, certainly influence history on a microcosmic level (during spans of centuries or millennia), there are larger factors, such as geography and ecology,at play when human history is considered as a whole over the last 13,000 years. Diamond is looking at the forest rather than the trees; thus, to fault the author for ignoring such factors as religion and politics is off the mark, since such belief systems didn't exist in anything remotely resembling their present form for most of the period under discussion. Furthermore, to identify human advances in terms of culture still fails to explain how differing cultures arose in the first place.<br />Finally, and more easily dismissed, are those hecklers who howl \\"political correctness.\\" Such critics seldom identify flaws in the author's arguments or even tell us what they insinuate by this increasingly meaningless term.<br />Since the book's span is so sweeping and since many of Diamond's hypotheses are offered tentatively (as suggestions for a new \\"science\\" of history), there are bound to be statements or implications that may eventually prove inaccurate or too simplistic. I strongly suspect, however, that his overarching thesis will withstand the test of time; at the very least, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" will inspire open-minded thinkers to consider human history--in its broadest sense--in a whole new light.at play when human history is considered as a whole over the last 13,000 years.

US	41905526	R1GELBRQ7EGXV5	015100692X	990216712	The Crimson Petal and the White	Books	5	81	88	N	N	Tennyson's epic poem about feminism retold	Seemingly overlong and decidedly graphic (in both the vulgar and literal senses), Faber's magnum opus, it's true, crams a 200-page plot into an 830-page book. Yet, while certainly engrossing and often difficult to set aside, &quot;The Crimson Petal&quot; is primarily a character novel, heavy on atmosphere, light on action, postmodern in its knowingness, and unapologetic in its grimy, lurid detail. (Think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; meets &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman.&quot;)<br />Readers baffled by the title may appreciate knowing its source, which also provides clues to the novel's characters and themes. The phrase is lifted from Tennyson's epic poem &quot;The Princess&quot; (the source for Gilbert and Sullivan's &quot;Princess Ida&quot;), in which Ida becomes an advocate of women's rights, breaks her engagement to a prince of a neighboring kingdom, and establishes a university. The prince and two buffoonish friends sneak into the school dressed as women, and various and sundry events ensue, culminating in a pitched battle between the prince's peers and the princess's army, during which the three men are seriously injured. Placed under the women's care, the prince eventually wins over Ida, but only after converting to feminism and admitting that he should &quot;be more of a woman, she of man.&quot; While the bed-ridden prince pleads his case, Ida reads the following song, which begins and ends as follows:<br />Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;<br />Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;<br />Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font;<br />The fire-fly wakens: waken thou with me....<br />Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,<br />And slips into the bosom of the lake:<br />So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip<br />Into my bosom and be lost in me.<br />In Faber's novel, &quot;the crimson petal, now the white&quot; is Sugar, a teenage prostitute who learns her trade from her own mother but who manages both to obtain a respectable, if unconventional, education and to retain a precocious level of dignity. Her ability to transcend the limits of her &quot;station,&quot; as well as her willingness to &quot;do anything you ask of me,&quot; leads Sugar to her prince, William Rackham, an heir to a perfumery who is stymied by his own artistic pretensions. Sugar becomes far more to William than an illicit relationship: she succeeds first as his mistress, then as his unacknowledged business partner, and then as... but to tell you more would be unfair.<br />The novel features four other characters, each uniquely displaying the nature of the fraught relationships between men and women: Agnes Rackham, William's near-mad wife, whose Victorian naivety is so complete that she is unable to comprehend how she came to be &quot;with child&quot;; Sophie, his six-year-old daughter, who is squirreled away out of view of everyone but the servants; Henry, his brother, who is called by religious devotion but who considers himself too impure to enter the clergy; and Emmeline Fox, a widow and Henry's close friend, whose eccentric opinions, along with her activities to save prostitutes from mortal and physical danger, scandalize other members of &quot;Society&quot;--and present Henry with more temptations than he can bear.<br />Various elements of Tennyson's poem work their way into the novel, such as the characters of Bodley and Ashwell, who mirror the prince's partners-in-crime, Cyrial and Florian. The poem also supplies clues to the ending, which some readers find &quot;sudden&quot; and &quot;ambiguous.&quot; In Tennyson's fairy-tale version, the prince understands that honest empathy and social reform, not stealth and belligerence, are how to gain admission into the company of women. He says to Ida:<br />&quot;Blame not thyself too much,&quot; I said, &quot;nor blame<br />Too much the sons of men and barbarous laws;<br />These were the rough ways of the world till now.<br />Henceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know<br />The woman's cause is man's....&quot;<br />In the more realistic Victorian London described by Michel Faber, however, William never achieves this understanding; he capitulates fully to &quot;the rough ways of the world&quot; and its &quot;barbarous laws,&quot; and rejects the college of women &quot;governed&quot; by Sugar. Given what's happened in the final chapters, what could be more clear than that each character is destined to go his or her own way?e is man's....&quot;<br />In the more realistic Victorian London described by Michel Faber, however, William never achieves this understanding; he capitulates fully to &quot;the rough ways of the world&quot; and its &quot;barbarous laws,&quot; and rejects the college of women &quot;governed&quot; by Sugar.

US	41905526	R14D0DLHYULI79	0451524217	645845418	McTeague	Books	4	25	27	N	N	A powerful portrayal of greed (in spite of its stereotypes)	Along with Stephen Crane, Frank Norris was one of the earliest writers in American naturalism--a tradition that eventually gave us Sinclair Lewis, Theodore Dreiser, and John Steinbeck. Influenced by social Darwinism and the French realists (especially Zola), their style tends to bluntness and away from romanticism and their view of civilization is marked by grimness. \\"McTeague\\" is considered Norris's classic work, and for good reason: its effect on later writers is obvious, and the book represents a shocking, bleak expose of greed and of the bestial nature of human beings.<br />McTeague is an unschooled, middle-class dentist who marries Trina, a daughter of German immigrants who is also the sweetheart of her distant cousin Marcus. Their lives are irrevocably changed when Trina wins $5,000 from a lottery, and their story is an examination of the resulting greed, miserliness, jealousies, intrigues, abuse, and homicide. Norris's worldview is not entirely gloomy, however: he introduces two endearing and unforgettable characters, Old Grannis and Miss Baker, an elderly couple whose only pleasure in the world is the knowledge of each other's existence on the other side of the shared wall of their two apartments. They are the antithesis of greed, and the simplicity of their desires provide much-needed comic (and, yes, romantic) relief.<br />The 21st-century reader, however, should be warned that Norris's ethnic stereotypes are not pretty. Zerkow, a Polish Jew, is a parsimonious junk peddler who has \\"bloodless lips\\" and \\"claw-like, prehensile fingers--the fingers of a man who accumulates, but never disburses.\\" He dreams incessantly of gold, and is entranced by the long-lost (and undoubtedly imaginary) gold dinnerware described by a Mexican maid, Maria, whom he eventually marries in order to monopolize her memories of the treasure. Maria herself is a dim-witted and unrepentant petty thief, yet her portrayal is more sympathetic in its evocation of naivety and innocence and suffering.

Like so many others, though, I am of split mind about the finale (and how appropriate, given the schizophrenic existence of its lead characters Ender-Peter and Val-Jane). While \\"Children of the Mind\\" does contain Card's trademark wit and while the last 100 pages kick into high gear, the final installment, on its own, is as unsatisfying as it is pleasing.<br />One of the major problems is Card's ill-considered decision to publish \\"Xenocide\\" and \\"Children of the Mind\\" as two books rather than one cohesive unit; the fourth entry seems more an epilogue to the series--a 350-page denouement--than the climax it should have been. Card admits he originally planned the two books as one work, and this admission resonates like an apology. Well over a third of \\"Children of the Mind\\" summarizes what happened in previous volumes, and another third is riddled with endless conversations on political and metaphysical topics, many of which the characters already debated at length in \\"Xenocide.\\" Only in the last 100 pages does Card finally abandon the themes that were presented more thoroughly (and competently) in the earlier books and turn his attention to resolving the many loose ends. In sum, Card would have been much wiser to have written a unified 600-page book rather than 900 needlessly repetitive pages.<br />The second problem is that Card's philosophical ruminations often steer awfully close to quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo. The entire section set on Pacifica, a planet governed by Samoans, feels particularly incongruous. (Peter and Wang-mu wonder aloud--twice--what they are doing on this particular world, a question that is never really fully addressed.) True--some of the philosophical questions are fascinating, but there's very little that wasn't already said better and more succinctly in \\"Xenocide,\\" and the dialogue is often excruciatingly shallow. Take this conversation between Valentine and Novinha, which reads in part:<br />\\"You didn't really need him anymore.\\" \\"He never needed me.\\" \\"He needed you desperately,\\" said Valentine. \\"He needed you so much he gave up Jane for you.\\" \\"No,\\" said Novinha, \\"He needed my need for him. He needed to feel like he was providing for me, protecting me.\\" \\"But you don't need his providence or his protection anymore.\\"<br />I wish I could tell you this bit of dizzying dialogue is an exception, but there are similar angst-ridden conversations between Miro and Val, Peter and Wang-mu--in short, between any two characters who feel the need to explain to each other their raison d'etre. In the earlier books, Card allowed metaphysical questions to arise as much from the actions of the characters and the development of the plot as from the dialogue; in \\"Children of the Mind,\\" everyone seems to be in post-Freudian interplanetary counseling.<br />Yet the book is not a wholesale disaster; and I particularly enjoyed the page-turning final resolution, even though it relies on a melodramatic sleight of hand. If the last third of \\"Children of the Mind\\" were merged with a pared-down version of \\"Xenocide,\\" the whole would probably have been equal to the excellence of the first two books in the Ender series.ation between Valentine and Novinha, which reads in part:<br />\\"You didn't really need him anymore.\\" \\"He never needed me.\\" \\"He needed you desperately,\\" said Valentine. \\"He needed you so much he gave up Jane for you.\\" \\"No,\\" said Novinha, \\"He needed my need for him.

US	41905526	R1OG3HLVUFQFX5	0786888156	113525174	Erasure	Books	4	11	12	N	Y	Much more than a novel on race	Written primarily as a satire, \\"Erasure\\" works on so many levels that to pigeonhole it as a novel about race is inadequate. The book also succeeds as an oddly affecting family drama, as a spoof on the \\"ghetto novel,\\" as a parody of academic pretension, and as a commentary on the publishing industry's infatuation with fleeting trends.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Erasure\\" has received prominence largely because of its discussion of what it means to be \\"black.\\" The protagonist, Theolonius \\"Monk\\" Ellison, is a professor at a major California university who writes postmodern, academic fiction but finds himself unread and ignored largely because he refuses to publish the type of work \\"expected\\" of African Americans. To an obviously significant extent, this portrayal is autobiographical: in an interview published in The Guardian (a British newspaper), Everett commented, \\"When I see my books in the Black Fiction or Black Studies section, I feel baffled. I really don't know what those terms mean.\\" Similarly, in the novel, Monk has a fit when he finds his own novels shelved in the African American studies section at a major bookstore chain. After reading this book, I went to a local branch of that same chain to look for Everett's other novels and found them all, ironically, in the last place I thought to look: under African American literature.<br /><br />But back to \\"Erasure\\": When another writer, after spending a few days in Harlem, writes a \\"ghetto novel\\" that becomes a national best-seller, Monk, in anger, writes a dead-on satire that is published and, to the author's surprise, taken seriously as \\"the best novel by an African American in years . . . a true, raw, gritty work.\\" The novel-within-the-novel, \\"My Pafology\\" (which is \\"reprinted\\" here in its entirety) is so over the top that it's impossible to believe that reviewers wouldn't recognize it as a farce. (An example of its humor: the main character, Van Go Jenkins, has fathered, by four different mothers, \\"fo' babies\\": Aspireene, Tylenola, Dexatrina, and Rexall.) But realism is not the point: Everett intends to reduce to absurdity the idea of the \\"ghetto novel\\" and its widespread acceptance as the embodiment of black experience.<br /><br />In the previously mentioned interview, Everett carefully qualified this view of literature, saying, \\"I have nothing against ghetto novels or rural Southern novels, except that they are the only representations out there.\\" This partly explains why, in spite of himself, Everett can't write a truly horrible \\"bad novel\\"; \\"My Pafology\\" is bracing even when it is ridiculous; it is undeniably authentic in its very inauthenticity. Everett acknowledged, \\"I can't even bear to read from that section because, despite all my efforts to the contrary, it works in some weird way.\\" It's clear from the many ambiguities throughout \\"Erasure\\" that Everett does not mean to denounce such works as much as he means to condemn their pervasiveness. After all, Everett himself makes quite clear his own admiration for Hurston's \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\"--the archetype of \\"rural Southern novels.\\"<br /><br />The aspect of \\"Erasure\\" that charmed me the most, however, was the interaction between Monk and members of his family: his aging mother, whose mental acuity is rapidly deteriorating; his sister Lisa, who works in a women's health clinic and is threatened by anti-abortion activists; and his brother Bill, who undergoes a hostile divorce when he reveals to his wife and children that he is gay. After you're done chuckling at Theolonius Ellison's antics as an author, you'll find yourself tearfully reflecting on the heartaches of his experiences as a son and brother. This storyline may seem detached from the major theme of the book--and that is, no doubt, exactly Everett's point: we all have families and experiences and backgrounds that transcend any notion of what it means to be \\"black\\"--or a member of any other blurrily defined group.Aspireene, Tylenola, Dexatrina, and Rexall.)

The semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical Mario is a young student and would-be writer whose careers and aspirations are disrupted when he falls in love with his aunt-in-law, much to the horror of their many friends and relatives living in Lima. Pedro Camacho, an eccentric (to say the least) Bolivian scriptwriter, has been hired at the radio station where Mario works, and the youth envies the prodigious output of Pedro's intricate soap operas and hopes to learn from his new mentor the secrets of being an artist. The chapters alternate between descriptions of Mario's amusing and increasingly complicated life and Pedro's formulaic and decreasingly coherent scripts, as each character is gradually overwhelmed by the burdens and expectations they've created for themselves.<br />On a deeper level, &quot;Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter&quot; is about artistic failure: Mario's writing suffers because he is too busy living life to the fullest, while Pedro's well-being deteriorates because he barely experiences life at all. While Mario's life is the stuff of literature, his various attempts at short fiction are too concerned with artistic affectation: heavy symbolism and laborious overwriting doom his every effort. In contrast, the scriptwriter is so overwhelmed maintaining the pace of the scripts for ten different serials that he can't keep track of his own sense of reality, much less his fictional characters and elaborate plots. The final chapter, which some readers have found disappointing, actually completes this theme: the writer who balances a passion for life and devotion to art is the one who ultimately succeeds.<br />I was about a third of the way through this book when I realized that I'd already read it, about twenty years ago. I think the reason that this novel didn't make much of an impression on me when I younger is that, in spite of the book's literary themes and the author's competent prose, the book remains true to its soap opera motif. Also, other than the three main protagonists, Mario's many relatives and coworkers are as indistinguishable as the heroes and victims in Pedro's soap operas. Still, given the popular and critical success of this novel, I'm actually surprised it seems to be out of print, and the reader looking for a light, humorous romp through Lima will be well rewarded by hunting down a used copy of this book.nd the author's competent prose, the book remains true to its soap opera motif.

US	41905526	RTU0DDQPLHHTV	0786808772	163865641	Summerland	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	Inspired fantasy, but the characters are somewhat blurry	Michael Chabon's first attempt at a novel for children (actually, for adolescents above age 12 or so) is a qualified success. \\"Summerland\\" has several things going for it: an imaginative plot, a magical setting, clever plays on words, Native American mythology, and lots of baseball metaphors. Yet--and this is a surprise for the author of \\"Kavalier and Clay\\"--the characters never really emerge from the dugout.<br />First, the highlights. Chabon's marvelous fantasy world is a multiverse: four different universes (the \\"human\\" world, Summerland, Winterland, and an inaccessible branch), connected by several hidden pathways that can be crossed with the help of \\"Shadowtails\\"--creatures who can instantly \\"scamper\\" within a world or can \\"leap\\" between universes. The inhabitants of these worlds include Sasquatches (don't call them \\"Bigfoot\\"!), wererats, goblins, giants, ferishers, pixies, and innumerable other species, all of whom share a passion for playing baseball, especially to settle their many otherworldly bets, arguments, and conflicts. The four worlds are intertwined branches of the Lodgepole (alias \\"The Tree\\"), which the evil Coyote and his followers (the \\"Rade\\") plan to poison and thus end the world as we know it (or thought we knew it, until a werefox shows up in a corner of Washington State). The hero, Ethan, and his friends from Clam Island are chosen (naturally) to save the universe.<br />The author does an admirable job of depicting both his mystical creation and Ethan's adventures, and he does so with a good deal of wit and humor. Ultimately, however, the novel's main characters are drawn with indistinct strokes, and the supporting cast is barely drawn at all. The book's premise demands a team of nine (in order to play ball, of course), plus a variety of fiends and lingering oddballs, but Chabon doesn't really flesh out the almost twenty characters who have major screen time. The protagonists are one-note characters: Ethan (insecure and unathletic), Jennifer T (tomboyish), Thor (an outsider, but for a reason), and Mr. Feld (bumbling). The rest of the crew, unfortunately, is somewhat indistinguishable. Even after 500 pages, I couldn't tell you who was Cutbelly, who was Cinquefoil, and who was Pettipaw, and whether they were werefoxes, wererats, werewolves, or what have you. And, desperately in need of a ninth player 360 pages into the story, our heroes abduct an aging major-league Anaheim Angel, who then pretty much serves as a needless benchwarmer for the remainder of the plot.<br />Kids might be enthralled enough by the fantasy elements to enjoy \\"Summerland,\\" but, as an adult who reads both fantasies and children's literature, I found the lack of characterization a serious disappointment. All the same, I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy the likes of Philip Pullman, C. S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, and Tolkien, and who are counting the hours until the sixth Harry Potter book comes out.(tomboyish), Thor (an outsider, but for a reason), and Mr. Feld (bumbling).

US	41905526	R3CVEZE8BLJWC5	0380521830	79559742	The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court	Books	4	116	120	N	N	Behind-the-scenes look at the Burger Court	Although &quot;The Brethren&quot; was written a quarter of a century ago and it covers the Supreme Court sessions from 1969 to 1975, there are two reasons to hunt down a used copy of this book and read it today. The first is its examination of the important Court decisions of Warren Burger's early years, all of which still reverberate with their controversy and implications. The second is to learn how, in spite of its famously left-of-center decisions, the Court began taking a sharp turn to the ideological right, spurred by the appointment of Burger and by the ascent of the young William Rehnquist.<br />&quot;The Brethren&quot; gave the Burger Court a reputation from which it never quite recovered. Although the Supreme Court has historically had its share of in-fighting, incompetence, and inanity, its internal meltdowns in the 1970s were occasionally beyond the pale. Woodward and Armstrong portray Burger as a well-meaning but ultimately misguided man obsessed by the legacy of Earl Warren, concerned far more with image than with principle, unskilled in management techniques that would have helped bring the Court to a consensus, and unashamed of his repeated attempts to assign the Court's decisions in a fashion insured to thwart the will of the majority. Even today, most historians, regardless of ideological bent, view the Burger years as a mediocre and often inconsistent transition between the liberal Warren Court and the conservative Rehnquist Court.<br />It's not a perfect book, by any means. Woodward and Armstrong are at their page-turning best when they examine in detail some of the more famous decisions and controversies faced by the Court (busing, obscenity, abortion, the death penalty, and--especially--Watergate). And the account is surprisingly balanced: anyone expecting a &quot;liberal&quot; flogging of an increasingly conservative court will be surprised, on the one hand, by the authors' depictions of the increasingly unfit and ornery Douglas and the unsophisticated yet affable Marshall and, on the other hand, by their open admiration of Rehnquist, who comes across as (by far) the most likeable and amiable of the justices. Nevertheless, their account is a bit too heavy on office gossip. True--this journalistic style brings the fourteen justices who served during these years to life, but what's lacking is the necessary detailed legal background that would make sense of the Court's day-to-day work rather than its scandalous backbiting and personality conflicts. Overall, though, it's an admirable piece of journalism that makes the Court seem as human as it really is.isticated yet affable Marshall and, on the other hand, by their open admiration of Rehnquist, who comes across as (by far) the most likeable and amiable of the justices.

The story follows the plight of the world's few remaining survivors after three (possibly) coincidental cataclysmic events of uncertain origins: the genetic development of mobile, carnivorous plants; the blinding of the earth's inhabitants by what may or may not have been a meteor shower; and the sudden onset of a mysterious and fatal disease. Most of the world's inhabitants are sightless and unable to defend themselves against the marauding plants, and even those with vision succumb to the plague.<br />End-of-the-world scenarios have of course been done to death, especially in B-movies, but &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot; has withstood the test of time--not because of its plot, but because it anticipated many other works and because the writing and themes are a cut above your typical pulp fiction. Nearly every episode in the book has been replicated in dozens of science fiction and horror movies and novels. Filmgoers who have seen &quot;Resident Evil&quot; or &quot;28 Days Later&quot; will recognize the opening scene, in which Wiliam Masen wakes up in a hospital room, unaware that the world as he knows it has come to a devastating end. Other scenes recall the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; series and similar films, and the descriptions of the survivors' efforts to rebuild society clearly influenced many later works of dystopian fiction.<br />Wyndham adopts a minimalist &quot;noir&quot; style for the first sections, using a surreal first-person perspective to convey the confusion, fear, and isolation afflicting William Masen while he tries to figure out what has happened. When the focus of the book changes from the lone individual to bands of the living, the author shifts to a more expansive and analytic prose that fleshes out the book's social and political commentary.<br />It is the exploration of these themes that makes the book so fascinating. As various groups of survivors unite together, they adopt different modes of government: a communalism that tries to rescue as many people as possible, a fundamentalism entrenched in its devotion to outdated moral codes, a militarism that quickly degenerates to totalitarianism, and a rationalism relying on the survival of the fittest to guarantee as many new offspring as possible. Each of these myopic systems suffers from a slavishness to one goal at the expense of any other: preventing as many deaths as possible, preserving morality, maintaining law and order, and insuring the survival of the species. Following the traditions of the best dystopian fiction, Wyndham uses his story to examine the faults with our present world and its communist, theocratic, authoritarian, and Darwinian societies.<br />The ending of the book is just open-ended and ambiguous enough to have allowed for a sequel, by Wyndham wasn't the type to write or authorize one (although Simon Clark published &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; two years ago). This closing ambiguity seems appropriate: in the real world, there are never as many solutions as there are problems.that makes the book so fascinating.

In addition to her volumes on folklore and ethnology, she wrote four novels and several stories and coauthored a play with Langston Hughes, all of which drew heavily on the material she collected for her studies and on events from her own life. Of her works of fiction, &#34;Their Eyes Were Watching God&#34; is undoubtedly her best and, after reading it a second time, I have even more admiration for her accomplishment.<br /><br />One of the reasons the book resonates today with so many readers is the story's major theme: the difficulty of reconciling the struggle between social approval and well-being, on the one hand, and passion and self-respect, on the other. The heroine, Janie, must often do what is expected of her (by her grandmother, her husbands, or the community) at the expense of her own pleasure.<br /><br />Yet Hurston intends to do more than tell a simple story of a Southern black woman looking for Mr. Right. The author introduces characters and sketches that have less to do with the advancement of the plot and more to do with creating an environment: what life was like for black communities in Florida during the early twentieth century--the humor and the resentment, the misery and the fortitude, the camaraderie and the backstabbing. Characteristic of this leisurely documentary method is the manner in which the town's older inhabitants razz one another or the tale of Matt and his yellow mule, which manages to be at once funny, appalling, touching, and inspiring. All in all, the use of dialect and the meandering style make this novel not an &#34;easy read&#34; but a rewarding one.<br /><br />It saddens me that so many high school students are required to read this book. (I can relate: an exposure to &#34;Julius Caesar&#34; in the ninth grade instilled in me a loathing of Shakespeare that took me a decade to overcome.) This is a book to be savored like fine wine, not administered like cough syrup. An exceptional teacher with a classroom of widely-read students (as in AP English) might well succeed in stimulating enthusiasm for the story of Janie and Tea Cake, but it's certainly not a book meant to be crammed in a night's panic in order to answer a series of exam questions.<br /><br />For those readers young and old who do enjoy &#34;Their Eyes Were Watching God,&#34; I also recommend Hurston's first novel, &#34;Jonah's Gourd Vine,&#34; which portrays the same period and communities while recounting episodes based very closely on the author's own childhood.ine, not administered like cough syrup.

US	41905526	R3SBR1D6RE6EI6	1585672785	137792401	The Clicking of Cuthbert	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Formulaic, but pure Wodehouse (and a great gift for golfers)	The \\"Oldest Member\\" of a country club narrates ten comic tales to dispirited and frustrated younger golfers in order to boost their spirits, enhance their morals, and keep them from snapping their clubs in half. In typical Wodehouse style, most of the stories involve chasing skirts as well as replacing divots (although definitely not in that order of priority).<br />There are two principal scenarios: a player's love of golf either impresses or repels the girl of his dreams, or two players fall in love with the same woman and their performance on the course settles the dispute. Since these formulae have, of course, a very limited number of possible outcomes, it's best to savor the chapters singly, more to enjoy the humor and less to anticipate the endings, which are usually foreseeable. (My favorite story strays from the basic blueprint--sort of. A golfer with a mean temper relies on some randomly selected sayings of Marcus Aurelius in order to maintain his cool, impress his boss, earn a promotion--and keep his fiancee.)<br />How much one appreciates this volume will, not surprisingly, depend on whether one plays golf. Golf lovers are sure to enjoy these sketches, which are greatly enhanced by Wodehouse's trademark drollery and smart-aleck asides. Recuperating 18-hole addicts (I myself have been club-free for 23 years, 6 months, 10 days) will find themselves heading for a tavern to avoid relapse.

And non-golfers--even readers who enjoy Wodehouse's other works--are certain to be baffled by passages such as this one: \\"The twelfth is a long, dog-leg hole, bogey five. Alexander plugged steadily round the bend, holing out in six, and Mitchell, whose second shot had landed him in some long grass, was obliged to use his niblick. He contrived, however, to halve the hole with a nicely-judged mashie-shot to the edge of the green.\\"<br />If haven't read Wodehouse before, this volume isn't where you should start--especially if you don't play golf (I recommend \\"Joy in the Morning\\").

US	41905526	R38VBK73RRVU	0375400052	187052723	The Married Man	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Exquisitely written, yet too parochial and detached	With a keen eye for detail and his acknowledged skill at crafting exquisite prose, Edmund White offers a perceptive portrait of three jet-setting gay men and the havoc wreaked on their lives by AIDS in the early 1990s.<br /><br />The first 200 pages focus on the travails and travels of the main characters: Austin, who is nearly 50 as the novel opens and who pursues relationships with a series of men nearly half his age; his lover Julien, a young French man who is married (although a month away from being divorced) when he meets Austin; and Austin's ex-lover Peter, only slightly older than Julien and in declining health from AIDS-related illnesses. Julien and Peter end up hating each other, even though they are quite alike, except in their attitudes toward being gay: \\"Peter respected gay life as it was--mindless, sexual if not sexy, procrustean--whereas Julien was too much of a lawgiver to accept the rules handed down by the tribe.\\"<br /><br />White portrays three men who, along with nearly all their friends, belong to an extraordinarily narrow swath of gay (white) humanity--and who are not particularly endearing to boot. Austin is descended from Southern gentry, Julien has aristocratic pretensions, and Peter is a preppie WASP from Connecticut; all three are unemployed (or underemployed), and all three have far too much time on their hands. Perhaps the greatest fiction of the book is that the three men get along with each other at all. Although none of them is especially intelligent, they share a patrician worldview, enjoy seemingly unlimited financial reserves, and travel to Rome, to Disney World, to Key West, to New England, to Canada, to Mexico, to Morocco.<br /><br />Since this is a character novel with little in the way of plot or story, whether you enjoy it may depend on whether you find the wine-and-cheese set all that interesting. In the Edwardian novels of Henry James or E. M. Forster, such characters are fascinating because of their eccentricities and wit, their foibles and shrewdness. In a turn-of-the-millennium American novel about AIDS, however, White's aimless protagonists come across as insufferable, pampered, and shallow. Few readers will share Austin's astonishment that a letter from Julien's father \\"had two spelling mistakes and two mistakes in grammar.\\" (The horror!) Perhaps the characters' tendency to pass off such pretentiousness for refinement is meant to be humorous, but there's a supercilious undercurrent that works to weaken any intended irony.<br /><br />The last third of the novel deals with the illness of one of the characters. No one would ever accuse White of being manipulative or maudlin, but here he tends to the other extreme, adopting an aloof, almost journalistic stance as he describes the deteriorating health of a person suffering from AIDS and the stress placed on the caregiver. For those of us who have lost friends to AIDS, this nearly clinical portrayal seems a pale imitation of the actual ordeal. Where is the anger? the tenderness? the misery? the fear? Only during the final days do such emotions enter the narrative; it's as if White saved all his passion for the final march to death and for the self-incrimination and guilt that haunts the survivors. Yet even these last two terrifying chapters contain sentences that could have been lifted from a tourist guide (\\"Zagora, an ugly modern town, was squeezed into the crook of the elbow of the Draa . . . the soaring date palms protecting the almond and lemon trees from the sun and, they, in turn, shading the plots of wheat and barley\\").<br /><br />In spite of its brilliantly evocative prose, then, \\"The Married Man\\" is often too earnest and parochial to transcend the narrow confines of the milieu it describes, too detached and dispassionate to convey the horrors of living with (and dying of) AIDS.ewdness.

US	41905526	R3Q2JBKK29RCMA	1585672734	675082326	A Few Bloody Noses: The Realities and Mythologies of the American Revolution	Books	3	43	54	N	N	Arguing with the ghosts of historians past	History is written by the winners, and this is British journalist Robert Harvey's attempt to rewrite it from the losers' perspective. Highly readable (often compellingly so), Harvey's account of the American Revolution has much to recommend it, and his narrative offers a nice refresher course in military history. The volume also includes extensive excerpts (with modernized spelling) from contemporary chronicles, lending the book a \\"you are there\\" touch.<br />Throughout, Harvey inveighs against Americans' \\"heroic view of the Revolution\\" and \\"the remarkably enduring nature of the myths.\\" But many of his versions of episodes in American history seem to have been culled from textbooks written fifty years ago. (Of the more than 160 works listed in the bibliography, only 14 were written after 1980.) Not once does Harvey identify the writers with whom he is arguing: his summary of the \\"prevailing myths\\" are always prefaced by \\"It is asserted,\\" \\"It is claimed,\\" \\"It is widely believed.\\" For example, he claims that \\"one of the darkest and least researched corners of the American Revolution was the treatment of the loyalists,\\" but he seems entirely oblivious of the scholarly studies by Christopher New or William Nelson or even of the standard popular account by Christopher Moore. Although Harvey seems to regard his revisionism as startlingly original, there is little that is new here. Instead, he seems to be debating the ghosts of such long-dead historians as Carl Becker and George Trevelyan.<br />At times, too, he is so intent on offering a contrary view that he traps himself in a corner. For example, he argues that historians \\"have traditionally ascribed\\"  Burgoynes's disastrous expedition to Albany and surrender at Saratoga \\"to massive incompetence on the part of the British.\\" Instead, Harvey contends, the British loss \\"can be more readily explained by the professional jealousy of two rival commanders.\\" Let's set aside the hair-splitting question of whether military leaders who favor spite over victory can still be considered \\"competent.\\" I defy anyone to read the subsequent fifty pages and still conclude that Burgoyne, Clinton, and Howe were anything other than stupendously inept. Even Harvey seems to abandon his initial claim, finally admitting that defeat was \\"due to Burgoyne's suicidal impulse to advance and attack.\\"<br />The bulk of Harvey's book focuses on military strategy and the specifics of various battles. He gives relatively short shrift to the ideological, social, economic, or political underpinnings of the conflict. When he does offer such analysis, though, his reliance on work published in the United States undercuts his thesis that Americans have an uncritical view of their own origins. His section on the frontier war is little more than an abstract of Colin Calloway's \\"The American Revolution in Indian Country,\\" and the chapter on the hypocrisy of slave-owners fighting for liberty summarizes Benjamin Quarles's 1961 study, \\"The Negro in the American Revolution.\\" (The author seems unaware of the dozens of studies published since Quayle's that recount in far more critical terms the treatment of blacks by American rebels.)<br />Harvey characterizes American complaints against British rule as whining hypocrisy, and he (correctly) points out that British colonial rule was so minimal as to be hardly \\"oppressive\\"--in large part because London was unable to rule the colonies effectively from across the Atlantic Ocean. He also claims that the rebels barely won the war and, if it weren't for the French, probably would have lost it. Yet, even if the British had prevailed in the 1780s, it is certain America would have won independence in some future decade--as did Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, India, Iraq, and every major colonial possession ever governed by the United Kingdom. Harvey never pauses to step back and look at the bigger picture: that while British rule may not have been so bad, it was untenable, unwanted,unnecessary, and ultimately doomed to failure.<br />Overall, then, Harvey's stirring prose and strident arguments can't overcome the fact that his book is both fifty years behind the time and ill-considered in its implicit defense of colonialism.unnecessary, and ultimately doomed to failure.<br />Overall, then, Harvey's stirring prose and strident arguments can't overcome the fact that his book is both fifty years behind the time and ill-considered in its implicit defense of colonialism.	2003-06-22

Set mostly in Bombay (although the city is never named), the protagonists endure the effects of the 1975 \\"state of emergency\\" declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (likewise never named) after the nation's high court convicted her of manipulating the previous election and ordered her to vacate her position. During this period, Gandhi's son, Sanjay, coordinated and fine-tuned India's notorious corruption, razed slum dwellings with disregard for their inhabitants, and initiated an infamous program of forced sterilization. These political and social cataclysms provide the backdrop for the characters' hopes and miseries. (Readers might find it useful to know that Mistry was born, raised, and educated in Bombay and, at the age of 23, emigrated to Toronto a month after the state of emergency was declared.)<br />The widow Dina hires Om and his uncle Ishvar to work in her home sewing piecework for export and accepts a student, Maneck, as a boarder. She learns quickly that she must balance her own well-earned privacy with her loneliness and the necessity for discipline with the need for money to pay the rent. One of Mistry's most remarkable and subtle accomplishments is the gradual conversion of the claustrophobic apartment from an uninviting place of employment and residence to a hospitable refuge from the miserable outside world.<br />Although Mistry has an almost journalistic (yet occasionally florid) narrative style all his own, the ghosts of Dickens and Tolstoy pervade the construction of the novel. While the novel's grim realism and certain plot elements recall \\"Anna Karenina,\\" Dickens's influence is perceptible in the use of melodrama and happenstance, in the details of urban bustle and squalor, and--most of all--in the supporting cast, a motley bunch of ragamuffins and brutes who transcend their own caricatures at surprising and pivotal moments. Of special note is the Beggarmaster, who manages to be simultaneously nefarious and endearing. You won't be able to decide whether you love him or hate him.<br />Mistry has been faulted for his use of \\"unbelievable\\" coincidences as a plot device. Although the individual experiences endured by his characters are realistic enough, the argument goes, the fact that every character endures every possible travesty and seems to be always in the wrong place at the wrong time stretches plausibility. Likewise, people are constantly running into each other in a city of millions. (To a New Yorker like myself, this doesn't seem all that far-fetched.) Yet, in the guise of Mr. Valmik, Mistry himself fully confronts this charge and flaunts it as a theme for his novel. A lawyer, proofreader, and sloganeer who randomly intrudes as a calm authorial voice, Valmik comments that \\"our lives are but a sequence of accidents--a clanking chain of chance events.\\" Mistry's novel intentionally violates the strict requirements of American realism; indeed, his fiction is a hybrid that seems appropriate to India: Victorian melodrama meets twentieth-century naturalism.<br />I am surprised by the number of readers who found the book too depressing to bear. Given the poverty and strife endured by India's lower classes, what others found hopelessly gloomy seemed to me utterly honest. Certainly (by American standards especially) the fates of many of the characters are horrifying, but Mistry balances the misery with just enough humor and warmth; even at the end (with one notable exception) the human spirit perseveres.

US	41905526	R14SQP7PFPR4MF	0375507973	671227604	The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses	Books	3	156	173	N	N	Absorbing (but uncritical) account of a new theory of smell	In this absorbing book, Burr describes the fragrance industry and how scents are created and marketed, weaves a \\"scientific morality tale\\" of professional \\"corruption in the most mundane and systemic and virulent and sadly human sense of jealousy and calcified minds and vested interests,\\" and attempts to explain and defend Luca Turin's novel theory of smell.<br />He succeeds with the first two goals. Readers will learn about the seven \\"Big Boys\\" (the companies that create virtually all new scents) and how their chemists and perfumers produce fragrance. Whether you enjoy this aspect of the book depends, perhaps, on your interest in fragrance itself; the workings of these businesses fascinated me, but the descriptions of various scents (as well as Turin's remarkably nondescript reviews from his \\"perfume guide\\") struck me as tedious. Burr also portrays scientists as plagued by self-interest and laziness and resistance to new ideas. This suggestion always surprises lay audiences, but it is hardly news to readers of Thomas Kuhn or of science writing in general. Galileo, Mendel, the early proponents of the Big Bang Theory, and many others encountered the same hostility or indifference faced by Turin.<br />The success of the third goal--detailing and defending Turin's olfactory research--is limited, however. On the one hand, Burr ably elucidates the prevailing theory--that we sense molecules by their shape--and raises the standard objections to this view. He then clearly presents Turin's theory: that smell results from molecular vibration (more specifically, from electron tunneling). Turin may ultimately be proven right, but Burr admits, \\"Though Turin has provided fascinating convincing preliminary evidence, there of course has to be independent confirmation by other labs before Vibration is accepted.\\"<br />On the other hand, Burr's commentary on Turin's research suffers from several weaknesses. First, Turin (and Burr) tend to see everything in black and white. Turin is especially prone to hyperbole, noting several times that \\"Everyone can smell as well as everyone else.\\" This is nonsense. Everyone has different base perceptions, and some people have deficiencies that affect their olfactory ability. Turin himself argues that smoking may actually enhance smell and admits that some people mistake the stench of urine with the aroma of honey--two scents many of us have never confused. In the same vein, Turin's opponents are portrayed as unwavering absolutists. Burr depicts the reception toward Turin's talk at a conference as hostile, yet none of the audience's questions, although challenging and skeptical, strike me as unreasonable or outrageous. (Instead, it is Turin who seems unnecessarily defensive and condescending.)<br />Second, Burr's book is entirely one-sided. He says, in a special author's note, that Turin's opponents refused to cooperate, but this argument is specious. Journalism is more than interviews. For example, even though \\"John Amoore had for years waged active war (via journal, Internet, and international conferences) against Vibration,\\" Burr reprints not one word of this apparently awe-inspiring paper trail. Throughout, Burr transcribes page after page of Turin's gossip-filled, meandering conversations and e-mails exchanges, but he usually refers to the extensive scientific literature only when Turin supplies the reference.<br />Most seriously, Burr tends to report many of Turin's statements uncritically. For example, Turin claims he discovered that proteins conduct electrons and that he thereby created a diode out of protein. Has this discovery been confirmed? Are there papers on this topic? Have other scientists used this finding? If so, how? (The only evidence Burr offers: Turin got the diode patented. There are, of course, thousands of patents for unworkable devices.) Likewise, on at least four occasions, Turin denounces any link between smell and sex. Ever since the discovery of pheromones in silkworms fifty yearsago, hundreds of scientists have explored the relationships between neurology and scent and sex. Turin dismisses them all, even though he appears to have done no research on the matter himself--and Burr never questions this unsubstantiated assertion.<br />Let's be clear: I'm not saying that Turin is wrong; rather, Burr comes across as Turin's publicist rather than a journalist who has confirmed Turin's statements, read the relevant articles, and tracked down the evidence. As a result, he probably won't convince researchers about the plausibility of Turin`s fascinating new theory. \\"The Emperor of Scent\\" raises a stink but never really clears the air.s ago, hundreds of scientists have explored the relationships between neurology and scent and sex.

The first half is an affecting look at Nathaniel's desire to fit into the college community after being passed over by its eating clubs (Princeton's version of fraternities); his efforts are both supported and frustrated by his two friends, by a charming (if sometime dotty) professor of literature, and by his own reticence. His love-hate relationship with Princeton supplies the emotional tension and witty melodrama that haunt his college career as well as his adult life.<br />The second half of the book relates a series of random events during Clay`s adult life: his son's recollection of Nathaniel's extramarital affair, his 10-year and 20-year reunions, the decision by both of his children to attend his alma mater. Wolff relates these episodes through a variety of devices and perspectives, such as a short story written as a grade-school assignment and essays written to accompany college applications. The resulting disjointedness does little to provide depth to the supporting characters or the emotional weight necessary for the climax, which should come as little surprise to anyone who has read \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" All in all, the final chapters don't live up to the promise of the first half of the book.	2003-06-08

He focuses on the Clinton and second Bush administrations as examples of the problems with either worldview: while Clinton, he argues, \\"staked his foreign policy on negotiation and norms,\\" Bush favored \\"the assertion of hard power and little else.\\" The unfortunate results, in Clinton's case, were the Bosnian conflict and the massacres in Rwanda and, in Bush's case, the deteriorating debacle in Afghanistan (and possibly in Iraq, although the verdict is still out).<br />Hirsch proposes a middle way: diplomacy and cooperation with international organizations and agencies, backed by the might of US and regional military force. The world's major powers will \\"feel both unthreatened and protected by the United States . . . only if Washington itself embraces the international community\\" while simultanesly projecting its power. The \\"international community,\\" he convincingly asserts, not only exists but is largely our creation, and it provides the best means for America to affirm its hegemony without seeming arrogant and to encourage democracy and well-being without seeming hypocritical.<br />He offers as a model the resolution of the 1999 crisis in East Timor, when Indonesian forces began slaughtering thousands of East Timorese residents, who were increasingly clamoring to reestablish the independence they lost in 1975. After an initial (and lethal) hesitation, the US coordinated an able, multilateral response: America suspended much-needed assistance to Indonesia, the IMF withheld money, the UN passed a resolution authorizing a peace-keeping force, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (of which Indonesia was a member) made a stink, China backed military invention, and the Australians supplied the troops. The combination of diplomacy, economic sanctions, regional pressure, and military force proved immediately and extraordinarily successful. Hirsch's discussion of why our intervention in Afghanistan seems to be failing, on the other hand, shows how military force alone--without regional cooperation and financial leverage--is a recipe for disaster (and the events of recent weeks lend this section of the book considerable weight).<br />Hirsch's conclusions often resemble the analysis offered by Clyde Prestowitz's \\"Rogue Nation,\\" even though the two authors approach their topic from widely divergent points of view. Hirsch's book is surprisingly deficient, however, in scrutinizing America's role in the Arab world (and the Islamic world in general). He skirts entirely the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the repercussions of American energy policy--two issues troubling American strategy not only in the Mideast but throughout the world.<br />Like any book on foreign policy, \\"At War with Ourselves\\" won't satisfy everyone, and it will surely anger those at either end of the political spectrum (e.g., neoconservatives and anti-globalists). Nevertheless, whether or not you agree with the selection of evidence or the overall thesis, this treatise offers much food for thought and challenges the way one thinks of the world., and military force proved immediately and extraordinarily successful.

Like \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" which was also set in the future, \\"Oryx and Crake\\" describes a dystopic tomorrow-land--but there the similarity ends. Featuring an uncharacteristically sparse prose and an abundance of scientific content, Atwood's bitingly satirical and hauntingly apocalyptic novel seems heavily influenced by science fiction novels of the last three decades, even while it recalls such classics as \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"Brave New World\\" and especially \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oryx and Crake\\" is technically a single-character novel; \\"Snowman\\" (or Jimmy) is the surviving human after a cataclysmic global disaster. He serves as a mentor of sorts to the strange yet harmless \\"Crakers,\\" who have been so genetically altered that they resemble humans only in their basic appearance. Their blandness is so thorough that neither Snowman nor the reader can tell them apart. Through a series of flashbacks, Snowman describes his closest friends Crake and Oryx and their role in bringing the world to its present state; and he mockingly details his attempts at elevating them to the status of gods for the new species. Atwood doesn't really develop these two characters; instead she (through Snowman's eyes) presents only the basic, painful \\"truth\\" behind a new Genesis mythology.<br /><br />The novel, one could argue, depicts a second character: the scientific community. Through extrapolation (one might say exaggeration--but I'm not so optimistic about industrial self-control), Atwood projects into the future the topics of today's headlines: anthrax, genetically modified foods, cloning, gene splicing, weapons of mass destruction, the overuse and abuse of psychiatric drugs, Internet porn, SARS, ecoterrorism, globalization. On a lighter level, she also skewers the moronic corporate brand names flooding the market these days: anyone who thinks her inventions are far-fetched should consider such mind-numbingly lame (and inexplicably popular) trademarks as Verizon, ImClone, MyoZap, Swole, Biocidin, and Rejuven-8.<br /><br />\\"Oryx and Crake\\" may well fall short of some readers' expectations for \\"a Margaret Atwood novel.\\"  But judged as an entry in the genre of science fiction, it's a powerful and visionary masterpiece.orporate brand names flooding the market these days: anyone who thinks her inventions are far-fetched should consider such mind-numbingly lame (and inexplicably popular) trademarks as Verizon, ImClone, MyoZap, Swole, Biocidin, and Rejuven-8.    \\"Oryx and Crake\\" may well fall short of some readers' expectations for \\"a Margaret Atwood novel.\\"  But judged as an entry in the genre of science fiction, it's a powerful and visionary masterpiece.	2003-06-04

This unashamedly political novel portrays one character torn between two worlds with disparate political and economic systems, and it focuses on the highlights and the inadequacies of both those worlds.<br /><br />Shevek, an unappreciated scientist from Anarres, travels to Urras, whose inhabitants seem to value better his discoveries in physics. Annares, the home of the \\"Dispossessed,\\" is a 175-year-old rebel outpost of anarchists who have established \\"an experiment in nonauthoritarian communism\\" that emphasizes community and cooperation and who must make the most of the limited resources on their desert planet to avert the constant threat of starvation. Anarres's mother planet, Urras, boasts a triumvirate of strong and repressive governments, the most important of which is the capitalist government of A-Io with its impressive wealth, cultural accomplishments, and scientific achievements.<br /><br />But all is not what it seems on either world. Le Guin alternates chapters detailing Shevek's early years of disenchantment on his lawless but peaceful native planet with chapters describing his growing realization that Urras has a significant \\"dispossessed\\" population as well. The novel is, of course, deeply informed by the Cold War--it was published in 1974--and each world features its own \\"ambiguous utopia\\" (the book's subtitle). The anarchists of Anarres have diluted their revolutionary vision with mindless and dogmatic conformism, discouragement of artistic pursuits and dissenting ideas, and an entrenched and uncaring bureaucracy that acts like a government in all but name. The capitalists of Urras, meanwhile, have traded libertarianism and meritocracy for a repressive oligarchy and the armed reinforcement of widespread economic disparities. As the novel progresses, Shevek appreciates that there is much to be learned from both (or rather, all) worlds.<br /><br />Some readers and critics have suggested that Le Guin is \\"promoting\\" anarchism/communism; this is too simplistic, since the book is far too subtle and tentative to work as propaganda.

The book is valuable regardless of whether or not the reader agrees with Prestowitz's politics (he's a longtime conservative and a former Reagan administration official) or his opinions on environmental, economic, and foreign policy concerns. Indeed, it's often hard to pinpoint the author's place on the ideological spectrum. For example, many conservatives will disagree with his support of several international agreements discarded by the Bush administration. Both conservatives and liberals will be dissatisfied about his ambivalence on the need for the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Many liberals will be turned off by his statement that, as of March 2003, \\"there is little choice for the United States and whatever partners it can gather to overthrow Saddam and occupy Iraq.\\"<br />What troubles Prestowitz, however, is not America's international policies per se but the manner in which we pursue those policies--a manner that may not always meant to be arrogant but certainly seems to be to the rest of the world. What especially distresses him are certain unilateralist principles proposed and implemented by \\"neoconservatives\\" like Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz.<br />In a way, it's too bad that Prestowitz chose such a deliberately provocative title, since the book itself, while undeniably opinionated, makes considerable effort to present both sides of every issue. Yet he correctly acknowledges that much of the international community regards the United States as a \\"rogue nation\\"--whether we are in fact or not. Likewise, the author contends that, although we are not technically an empire, we often behave like one--or, just as important, appear to others to have imperial pretensions. In a world where perception is reality, Prestowitz argues, it is foolish not to be concerned about international opinion, since we depend on other nations as much as they depend on us for both economic well-being and domestic security.<br />Above all, Prestowitz proposes that America's people and its leaders become better listeners--and Prestowitz himself is an astute listener. He has interviewed an impressive number of foreign diplomats, ambassadors, and government officials, and he faithfully presents their views even when he seems not to concur. What matters less to the author is how accurate international opinion is about American intentions or plans. Instead, he strives to understand how they arrive at contrary judgments: he provides historical context for various controversies and describes events, blunders, and misunderstandings that tend to support such mistrust.<br />He also contends that Americans often seem to treat other nations as inherently inferior or, even more insultingly, that we seem to feel that other cultures would be better off if they became just like us. As Prestowitz notes, \\"Nations are very much like individuals. More than desire for material gain or fear or love, they are driven by a craving for dignity and respect, by the need to be recognized as valid and just a valuable as the next person or country.\\" Rather than forcibly imposing our lifestyle on reluctant populations, we would be far more productive in providing a model worthy of admiration, \\"a city on a hill\\"--especially since most of the world's peoples greatly admire Americans themselves while they regard our government's policies with increasing suspicion.<br />Prestowitz's treatise is enhanced by a riveting journalistic style, an impressive array of evidence, and a lucid synthesis of a variety of foreign policy issues. I don't always agree with his views or his conclusions. For example, while I support his argument that we should greatly lessen our military presence in the Persian Gulf, Idon't buy his assertion that shrinking our dependence on Arab oil would cut off funding for terrorism. (Although a reduction in oil imports would offer many other benefits, the implication that boycott or impoverishment would reduce terrorism seems questionable.) Yet, even when one disagrees, the book is still informative and challenging, and I found his overarching thesis to be irrefutable: America cannot survive this century on its own, and we cannot continue to act as if we can.don't buy his assertion that shrinking our dependence on Arab oil would cut off funding for terrorism.

US	41905526	R14H6GOKUYAJMO	0553288105	229605670	The Gods Themselves	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Three thematically distinct tales linked by a clever premise	'The Gods Themselves' can most accurately be described as three distinct novellas that are linked by a ingenious premise (the transfer of matter and energy between parallel universes) and several events. Taking place on different worlds, each section of the book features unique characters, divergent tones, and different themes; the structure of the book reflects the tenuous connections and detached existences of the parallel universes themselves. This trifocal approach almost necessarily results in loose ends, but the result is surprisingly effective.<br />The first section is nearly unadulterated satire. A persistent but not very intelligent scientist, Hallam, accidentally discovers an impossible isotope (plutonium-186), which appears on our planet when aliens in another universe place it here, and its instability proves to be a 'free' source of energy. When another physicist, Lamont, discovers a potential flaw that might endanger our universe, his actions are motivated as much as by revenge against Hallam (and by the desire to be proven right) as by any thought of saving humankind from destruction. Although the explanation of the relate scientific concepts is both witty and brilliant, their basis in reality is absolutely ludicrous--but Asimov knows it. Instead, he uses this premise to skewer the foibles and egoism of scientists he spent most of his life observing.<br />The second story enters the other universe and presents the bildungsroman of Dua, who is so different from her counterparts that she is an alien in her own world. While the first segment's spotlights scientists and science, the second section focuses on an exotic culture and society, and along the way Asimov comments on racism, conformism, and sexuality. Dua then accidentally discovers the link to our universe--but to say anything more would be to say too much.<br />The concluding section is a more conventional science fiction tale, involving an older (male) traveler from Earth who moves to a lunar colony and falls in love with one of the younger (female) natives. Again, Asimov creates two very appealing characters, who become involved in the multiversal intrigues and who, in this episode, carry them to a crescendo. Yet the ending seems a bit contrived, and this third storyline doesn't have the impact or the cleverness of the first two parts. But 'The Gods Themselves' isn't really written for its plot(s) or its ending(s). Instead, the book's strengths are the inventiveness of its structure, the relevance of its themes, and the charm of its characters--and by those standards it's an otherworldly success.r colony and falls in love with one of the younger (female) natives.

I'm not referring here to the fact that its three lead characters are gay, since \\"At Swim, Two Boys\\" is so much more than \\"a gay novel\\" and since, while often sensuous, it is hardly erotic. Instead, the efforts of many readers may be thwarted by O'Neill's challenging and lyrical prose, the Irish brogue and street slang, the invented Latin derivations and oh-so-clever puns. After 50 to 75 pages, though, the reader's patience is well rewarded. Once you accustom yourself to the pattern of the prose, the context provides clues to even the most unfamiliar words, and I found the book difficult to set aside. (A little advice: after you pick up the cadence of the dialect, you may well want to go back and read those beginning pages again. The second time around revealed some wonderful passages and pivotal characterizations that flew right over my head initially.)<br />Set during the year prior to the Easter Rising in 1916, the novel focuses on two 16-year-old boys, Doyler and Jim, and their families. The main characters are finely portrayed, and (as others have noted) they successfully arouse the reader's sympathies. But O'Neill adds a memorable supporting cast: Jim's aunt, a doddering, whiskered crone who always seems far more aware of what's going on than one is led to believe; Eva MacMurrough, a rich patron of Irish rebel causes who is flustered by her nephew's Wildean tendencies; and, for comic relief, Jim's father, a pretentious wannabe who always manages to be in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />The most nuanced portrayal is that of the Anthony MacMurrough. Once may quibble over whether he is a pedophile: textual clues place his age in his early- to mid-20s; Doyler, his \\"rent boy,\\" is 16. (If he were straight, such a relationship would be lawful and accepted in many states and most countries.) Legality aside, though, one cannot deny he is a sexual predator, and it's difficult not to detest his narcissism and self-rationalizing hedonism. But, as the novel progresses (and here I am necessarily vague in order not to give anything away), he gradually and subtly realizes that such encounters are not the road to happiness. He ultimately redeems himself, learning to find fulfillment by sharing his love rather than taking his way. But to claim that MacMurrough is a \\"mentor\\" to Doyler and Jim misses the point: he learns far more from the boys than they learn from him.<br />A lesser author would be foolish to tackle so much: Irish nationalism, sexual orientation, Catholic guilt, alcoholism, class identity, unwed pregnancy, unionism and socialism, the burden of tradition, Joyce and Wilde and Flann O'Brien. O'Neill's success is his enviable ability to weave together all these topics so seamlessly while fashioning a unique and lyrical voice and spinning a page-turning, heartbreaking yarn.not to detest his narcissism and self-rationalizing hedonism.

He never even defines the difference between civilians and the military. (What about police forces? Defense industry personnel? Non-combat support crews? Elected leaders? Cabinet members?) He fails to draw the line between terrorism and \\"collateral damage,\\" which he mentions only a few times in passing. (Would the difference be in the perpetrator's motives? in the ability to prevent harm to civilians? in perceptions of the victims? in the severity of casualties?) Likewise, he excludes \\"domestic terrorism\\" from his discussion, without saying how it is distinguishable from international terrorism. (In which category would one put Aryan Nation, the IRA, the KKK, the contras in Nicaragua, FARC in Colombia? Are Islamic terrorists from Uzbekistan \\"domestic\\" before the dissolution of the USSR and \\"international\\" afterwards? If so, why does this difference matter?)<br />Carr argues further that warfare against civilians always backfires, that it \\"has never succeeded\\"--and this is probably the most controversial and ridiculed argument in the book. In support of this assertion, he must posit some dubious causalities, often taking this form: nations commit terrorism, then they experience violence or war or collapse, therefore terrorism always leads to decline and fall. For example, Carr argues that the Roman sack of Carthage led, hundreds of years later, to \\"their own eventual downfall,\\" or Sherman's March to the Sea inevitably created the resentment that resulted in home-grown terrorist groups like the KKK. Perhaps a full study could support such dubious theories, but Carr's brief analysis fails to connect the dots. He ignores or dismisses historical episodes that easily undermine his thesis: one might argue that the contras successfully ousted the Sandinista government and suffered little in the way of \\"backlash.\\" Likewise, he defines the bombing of Hiroshima as a terrorist act yet doesn't in any way show how this atrocity hurt the United States--in either the short term or the long term.<br />More incredibly, Carr canonizes Oliver Cromwell as an early practitioner of \\"progressive warfare\\" (limited military action that avoids civilian casualties), but to do so he must avoid mentioning the New Model Army's several sieges that ended in massacres of civilian populations--a practice culminating at Basing House. One could certainly argue that, relatively speaking, Cromwell was quite humane for his time, but by altogether ignoring commonly known evidence, Carr needlessly supplies his opponents with plenty of ammunition.<br />Another basic problem is that \\"The Lessons of Terror\\" covers more than two millennia in an essay hardly longer than a novella. Carr abandons detailed substantiation, careful qualification, and causal reasoning in favor of glib overstatement, facile generalization, selective evidence, and--above all--an aura of incontestable authority. Rarely has a historical essay been so peppered with the words \\"always\\" and \\"never,\\" often in italics. Carr seldom bothers to supply supporting evidence or citations for his arguments; instead he tends to rely on his own authority as a \\"military historian,\\" equally conversant in all periods of human history. On the whole, then, the problem with \\"The Lessons of Terror\\" is not its thesis or its suppositions or conclusions, a few of which I agree with (his comments on the CIA are especially on the mark), but that this short book isso sloppily and condescendingly argued.so sloppily and condescendingly argued.	2003-05-03

Although the novel opens (and, in a sense, closes) with Aakash, the family patriarch, the story focuses on the women--their occasional happiness, their common misery, and their fate. Aakash's wife, Jyoti Ma, begins a tradition that repeats itself with each generation: through selfishness and pride and naivete, she drives the members of her family away. This theme continues with her daughter, Tulsi Devi, granddaughter, Rohini, and great-granddaughter, Saakshi. With each generation, too, the men are basically absent: they either leave the family in search of mystical awakening or become aloof or tyrannical husbands who alienate their children.<br />The first part of the novel, set in a Himalayan Eden, reads like an allegory, in prose reminiscent of magic realism. As the story progresses, however, and the setting changes to Delhi and then to London, the tone gradually becomes less magical and more realist. The effectiveness of this technique is decidedly mixed, especially because the novel is fairly short for a multi-generational epic. The first section works in spite of its brevity; the \\"fairy tale\\" of Aakash and Jyoti Ma and their children is enchanting without being sentimental. But, once the family moves to the squalor and the bustle of India and England urban centers, the story feels rushed, the details seem random, and the author allows increasingly less time for the reader to \\"get to know\\" the members of each succeeding generation. Furthermore, the melodramatic (and somewhat expected) climax, which briefly recalls the fairy-tale imagery of the first part of the novel, is too forced to be remotely believable.<br />Through it all, each generation seeks comfort in different beliefs, from Hindu mysticism to 1960's hippie culture to Anglo-American spiritualism to yoga meditation. The philosophical motif that links each generation's seeking (the oft-repeated phrase \\"everything happens for a reason\\") is a bit corny--particularly because it`s never clear what the reason is--but since the characters (and the author) skeptically disparage each other`s beliefs (there's even a mocking reference to the \\"Arthur Conan Doyle Room\\" for seances), the story avoids being preachy.<br />The \\"Seduction of Silence,\\" then, is far too simple and (even at 400 pages) brief for the many complex themes it tackles. Still, Le Hunte has written a captivating and pleasant debut effort that ultimately succeeds because of its involving story and all-too-human characters.ion's seeking (the oft-repeated phrase \\"everything happens for a reason\\") is a bit corny--particularly because it`s never clear what the reason is--but since the characters (and the author) skeptically disparage each other`s beliefs (there's even a mocking reference to the \\"Arthur Conan Doyle Room\\" for seances), the story avoids being preachy.<br />The \\"Seduction of Silence,\\" then, is far too simple and (even at 400 pages) brief for the many complex themes it tackles.

Haunted by inner demons to the point of schizophrenia, Jacob Cullen is unable to control his rage, his murderous desires, and especially his jealousy, and he suddenly finds himself fleeing the comforts of his wife, his family, and the manor where he was a servant. He desperately attempts to corral his brutish manners but often fails when it matters most. Readers will probably alternate between horror at his actions and empathy (even sympathy) for his plight. More often than not, I found myself dreading to turn the page--but unable to stop reading.<br />To summarize the story is to give too much away. The plot twists began surprising me within eighty pages, and I wouldn't want to ruin the experience for others. Suffice it to say that events lead Jacob to join Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army and participate in one of its most gruesome sieges. McCann's stomach-churning descriptions of the battle scenes are equally compelling and unbearable--and the assault continues when Jacob and his newly found friend, Christopher Ferris, flee to the stench-ridden metropolis of London and, later, when they establish a homestead of squatters. Ferris, like the reader, is torn throughout these exploits by his own emotions toward the volatile Cullen: alarmed by Jacob's violence but disarmed by his underlying potential and attracted to his occasional tenderness.<br />One of the more astonishing aspects of the novel is the writing itself. Even established authors would have difficulty maintaining such a consistent tone for nearly 600 pages. McCann's wording recalls, but never slavishly imitates, the cadence of seventeenth-century prose, yet at no time is the narrative difficult to follow or read. The plot, the action, the characters, the writing--all the elements add up to a tour de force of historical fiction.	2003-04-21

The bulk of the book alternates between seven countries--the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Japan, and the Soviet Union, with important excursions to Spain and China. The first half highlights the repercussions of the Depression, and the last half details the events that led to World War II, with a pivotal intermission describing the Spanish Civil War as a preview of sorts to forthcoming afflictions. (The portrayal of Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia makes particularly gripping reading.)<br />Instead of offering an overarching thesis or new claims (which, given the complexity of the decade, would nearly guarantee quick rebuttal from any of a variety of historiographic camps), Brendon summarizes the major figures and events of the decade, and his study benefits greatly from material that has surfaced since the fall of the Soviet Union. He occasionally presents two views of a major event or political figure and often presents the middle ground as the most probable. More descriptive than explanatory, this comprehensive history is unabashedly old-fashioned and traditional--in the very best senses of both terms.<br />In spite of its length (700 pages, not including notes, bibliography, and index) and its density, Brendon's prose moves the pace masterfully, and he infuses the decade with an astonishing mix of humor, warmth, pity, and horror. Every passage is spiced with several witticisms or barbs uncovered by his impressive research. Less confidently, he offers detailed presentations of such occasions as Britain's Silver Jubilee of 1935, the Berlin Olympic Games of 1936, and the Paris International Exposition of 1937 (but not, strangely enough, the 1939 World's Fair)--yet he still analyzes adeptly the international importance of each of these events. Brendon traps himself in a cul-de-sac, however, when he discusses Hollywood, exposing less about the pervasive influence of popular entertainment than about his own high-brow tastes (e.g., his easy dismissal of escapist fair from Disney to Oz as \\"nostalgic evocations of small-town virtues\\" and \\"treacly affirmations of New Deal values\\").<br />Oh, but who really cares! Rarely has a single book synthesized for me so much information--both well-known and unfamiliar. Brendon has written what may well be regarded as the standard history of the decade. Not only should this book receive a permanent place in anyone's library, it will undoubtedly encourage readers to explore some of the many other volumes mentioned in the exhaustive bibliographic apparatus.rangely enough, the 1939 World's Fair)--yet he still analyzes adeptly the international importance of each of these events.

We all know that groups of young, hormone-enraged men--away from home for the first time, humiliated with abuse, trained to kill--sometimes behave no better than college fraternity brothers on a drunken rampage. Swofford's book of his experiences in the Marine Corps dispenses with the usual niceties of post-war military reporting and recounts his memories, warts and all, from recruitment through boot camp to the First Gulf War and \\"other battles\\" beyond. It's is not always pleasant reading, but it's vividly and trenchantly written. Particularly haunting are the description of the sickening wasteland created by aerial bombing, the portrayal of a fellow soldier who releases his frustration on enemy corpses, and the account of Swofford and his friends' atrocious behavior at a fellow veteran's funeral a few years after the war.<br />But what's been equally as fascinating (to me, at least) has been reading the reactions to and reviews of this book, both in the press and on the Internet. In one corner, we have the veterans of earlier wars, who disparage the Gulf War as the military equivalent of a ballet, since nearly all the Desert Storm participants never saw \\"real combat.\\" (Swofford himself acknowledges the \\"lack of satisfaction\\" such comparisons brought his peers: \\"the boredom, the fatigue, the rounds fired at fake, static targets, the nights of firewatch, and finally the letdown--all of these are frustrating and nearly unendurable facets of our war, our conflict. Did we fight? Was that combat?\\") Yet the wistful reminiscing of some of the older veterans, who somehow see the heroism of Gulf War veterans as a threat to their own war experiences, is troubling. It's true that Swofford himself didn't face hand-to-hand jungle combat, but he did see some action in this short war (including a friendly-fire incident that caused two deaths). And we all should be happy rather than bitter or jealous that the war ended so effortlessly for American troops. I, for one, don't think you require more exposure to violence to prove your \\"manhood.\\"<br />In the other corner are the readers who were correspondents or who served in the Gulf War. With the exception of one self-serving commentary (written, maybe not ironically, by a combatant from Task Force Ripper, the unit responsible for the friendly-fire incident), these readers seem to agree that this book has nailed it down: this is the military and the war they knew and fought and witnessed, unadorned and uncensored. They value the tales of camaraderie and discipline and Swofford's strong affection for his fellow grunts, despite (or perhaps because of) his conflicted feelings about serving.<br />Then there are those outside the ring: the dismayed parents and friends and lovers of soldiers--all of whom seem shocked and appalled by the bathroom humor, the machismo posturing, the juvenile attitudes, the cavorting with prostitutes. Expecting perhaps a Reader's Digest guide to the Middle East conflict or the moral equivalent of the Boy Scout Handbook, these poor folks, understandably, just don't want to hear what Swofford has to tell them.<br />All three audiences have valid objections, but it shouldn't diminish the value of the book for the remaining readers who (like me) will appreciate the candor and, yes, the bawdiness in this memoir. Some will find the book a celebration of violence; others will see it as \\"anti-war\\" or even disloyal, but this gulf of opinion merely reflects Swofford's own ambivalence, which becomes apparent near the close of the book: \\"Some wars are unavoidable and need well be fought, but this doesn't erase warfare's waste.\\" Putting aside the author's unpolished political views (which comprise only a tiny portion of the book anyway), my only objection is that many of Swofford's fellow marines are as indistinguishable as their haircuts; I would have liked to have had a better sense of the men behind the uniforms. Overall, though, \\"Jarheads\\" stands as a moving and sincere tribute to our troops, as well as a eulogy on the universal ugliness, frequent futility, and occasional necessity of war.ve had a better sense of the men behind the uniforms.

Like its predecessors, it is a gloomy, pessimistic novel (lacking Vance's trademark wit); unlike other novels in this genre, however, this one is enriched by a coming-of-age story focusing on the relationship between a father and a son.<br /><br />The first (and far better) half of the book focuses on the bond between Amiante and Ghyl. Amiante is a skilled artisan whose work is highly valued, but his lackadaisical and somewhat rebellious attitude keeps him from participating fully as a \\"proper\\" member of a strictly regimented society--a world in which any form of automation or duplication (cameras, molding, assembly-line manufacturing, etc.) is strictly forbidden in order to maintain the quality and uniqueness of handmade goods. Amiante imparts his aloofness to his son Ghyl, who shares his father's taste for individualism and subversion. Goaded by seditious friends and angered by his father's ultimate punishment, Ghyl hatches a scheme to leave his native planet; the plan goes awry but allows Ghyl to explore the universe and discover its history and secrets.<br /><br />Vance aims his barbs at a wide range of targets: the welfare state, capitalism, totalitarianism, religion, socialism, class warfare, unions, and more. And that's the problem with the last 100 pages: the novel is far too short for such a scattershot approach, and the \\"message\\" often gets lost in a series of quick resolutions and easy aphorisms. Planets are briefly visited, characters come and go, and secrets are revealed. While on Earth, for example, Ghyl spends a month (fewer than four pages) with Flora, \\"a slim blond Norwegian girl,\\"  but the reason for her sudden introduction and equally sudden disappearance is mystifying. Through contrived coincidences (e.g., running into a previous acquaintance on faraway planet) and relatively effortless disclosures, Ghyl learns \\"surprising\\" truths about the structure of his native society. The resolution of the plot and the revelation of the book's secrets are actually quite clever, so it's doubly sad that Vance seems to be rushing through the story, tying up loose ends without either making them all that believable or giving the reader much of a chance to consider what they mean.<br /><br />\\"Emphyrio\\" is, of course, meant to be an allegory, and I suspect that Vance deliberately modeled his \\"myth\\" as fable (like, say, \\"Animal Farm\\") rather than full-blown epic (like \\"Dune\\").

In this magnificently researched monograph, MacMullen digs far deeper and finds paganism lurking in the dimmest corners of Christianity. His book focuses on the first millennium, but even today's Christians (especially Catholics) will recognize many of the rituals and beliefs he discusses.<br />The book is not without controversy. The traditional view has been that, during the century after Constantine's conversion, most of the Roman Empire (and lands beyond) converted to Christianity with wholehearted gusto, and pagan beliefs survived only in remote pockets. Not so, according to the author's overwhelming evidence: paganism had an extremely long half-life. MacMullen also dispenses with the long-held traditional argument that women and slaves converted to Christianity because paganism did not offer them much. (If anything, as he clearly and succinctly shows, the reverse is true.) Furthermore, MacMullen discusses how, beginning in the fourth century, upon subsuming power, Christians dealt with pagans in the traditional (non-Christian) way: they persecuted them with intimidation, torture, forced conversions, and death. Persecutions continued for many centuries, indicating that the underlying pagan culture was indeed very hearty.<br />The problem with the early Church's aggressive approach is obvious: many converts were not true believers, or they didn't quite understand what they were accepting. In addition, the relatively new Christianity, \\"a religion of the book\\" that was strong on doctrine, lacked a distinctive culture or the ability to satisfy everyday needs and desires (whether worldly or supernatural). Still, the Christian elites--the educated or the anointed--placed far more faith in the supernatural (God) than did their pagan predecessors, who viewed the reliance on superstition (gods) as a crutch for the lower, especially rural, classes. This difference ironically gave Christianity an advantage: believers at both ends of the social spectrum, from bishops to peasants, looked to the supernatural for explanations of everyday occurrences, from the weather to illness to death. Thus, many pagan rituals provided the basis for Christian traditions: offerings to the gods became cults of the saints, pagan feasts became Christian festivals, etc. As Jerome acknowledged, in MacMullen's paraphrase: \\"better, worship of the saints in the pagan manner than none at all.\\"<br />MacMullen marshals an impressive parade of evidence, both in the text (only 160 pages) and in the notes and bibliography (which occupy only slightly less space). Unlike most scholars, he entirely avoids unfamiliar terminology and spices his treatise with glib comments and wry witticisms--it's been a long time since I've chuckled while reading a scholarly monograph.  Unfortunately (alas, like most scholars), MacMullen is just not a very good writer. Perfectly lucid passages alternate with sentences that resemble very rough lecture notes. He has an aversion to direct statement and a fondness for pronouns that will send the most alert reader hunting for an antecedent. A not atypical sentence: \\"Within tradition, what lacked any supporting scripture or even any conscious reason they might think foolish; but they accepted it as harmless.\\" \\"They,\\" whose antecedent appears three sentences previous, refers to pagan civic leaders. Even armed with this discovery, most readers will find this sentence difficult, I wager. Other sentences are backwards for no good reason: \\"But in the ideas and rites just described a large area of new loyalties opened up.\\" And, finally, there are run-on sentences of such length that a lethal dose of caffeine is required to follow the sense from beginning to end. Such idiosyncratic sentence structures might be amusing affectations when used sparingly, but their overuse in this volume is frustrating and unnecessary.<br />It's too bad that MacMullen isn't kinder to his readers. Although the book is certainly meant for a scholarly audience, it contains little material that wouldn't be within reach of interested readers outside the academy. (Even professional historians must tire of such sloppiness.) Nevertheless, if you're willing to slog through tortuous prose, you'll find treasures on every page.<br />It's too bad that MacMullen isn't kinder to his readers.

He discusses how the brain evolved over millions of years, then he narrows his focus to examine how, during the last 40,000 years, language and self-awareness enhanced the brain's capabilities (through a process he calls \\"cultural evolution\\"). With its lack of jargon, \\"The Ape That Spoke\\" could be read by non-scientists interested in pursuing the far more exhaustive (and perhaps intimidating) studies by the likes of Steven Pinker or Antonio R. Damasio.<br />The reader should be aware, however, that McCrone's survey is occasionally reductive or misleading. Its most noticeable shortcoming, as the author himself admits on his own Web site, is that the book is \\"pretty sketchy on the neurological underpinnings of consciousness.\\" (His later books attempt to address this disparity.) Second, readers must be very attentive to the endnotes in order to differentiate between scientific findings and McCrone's frequent speculation. Third, the book often presents tentative scientific conclusions as established fact and skirts the heated debates among scientists regarding language, consciousness, and intelligence. (His neglect of neurological studies only exacerbates this weakness.)<br />Finally, and perhaps most important, McCrone repeatedly uses the concept of \\"evolution\\" when he means \\"progress,\\" \\"change,\\" or \\"development.\\" (Two examples selected from dozens: \\"Language gave early man just such a way to evolve and pass on complex ideas.\\" \\"But now technology is starting to open the door to rapid mental evolution.\\") Even McCrone acknowledges that such oversimplification is not always useful when talking about something as complex as evolution, \\"where an effect can be its own cause and . . . where stable patterns emerge as what works outlasts what does not.\\" Yet he nevertheless persists in using \\"evolution\\" in its metaphorical sense. Such vagueness may be appropriate for some topics, but it is certainly confusing in a book on evolution and language. In particular, as Stephen Jay Gould notes in \\"Full House,\\" the term \\"cultural evolution\\" should be abandoned altogether, since societal transformation, unlike evolutionary change, can occur--and regress--both rapidly and deterministically (e.g., humans can easily and radically influence the direction of their culture and still remain human, but they cannot alter the genetic makeup they collectively inherited from evolutionary processes!).<br />Keeping in mind these caveats and shortcomings, diligent readers might still find McCrone's survey a useful introduction to more accurate and complex works on the topic.oes not.\\" Yet he nevertheless persists in using \\"evolution\\" in its metaphorical sense.

Instead, his diaries both gave him the therapeutic outlet he needed while growing up and supplied this book with the rich detail that makes it, at times, so unbelievable.<br /><br />Burrough's mother was a struggling poet who wanted to be like Anne Sexton, and, lacking any talent, she instead suffered Sexton's psychotic episodes. The father, unable to deal with his wife's instability, drank himself out of the relationship. Eventually, Burroughs is abandoned by his family and adopted by his mother's psychiatrist, a certifiable lunatic who dispenses drugs and sex far more diligently than sound advice and who believes discipline is an evil to be avoided at all costs. To complicate an already disastrous situation, other members of this adopted family include several deeply disturbed individuals, including a pedophile who finds a ready victim in the 14-year-old Burroughs.<br /><br />I read this book two months ago, and, while I found it simultaneously appalling and enjoyable, I didn't know what to make of it. Since then, I've read several press reports that address some of the rumors generated by this book's publication. No, none of the people described in this book have sued (or threatened to sue) the author for libel. True, no child with the name &#34;Augusten Burroughs&#34; ever lived anywhere near Northampton--because Burroughs legally changed his name when he was 18. In sum, I've read nothing to indicate that Burroughs is making it all up.<br /><br />Yet there are two criticisms of the book I don't understand. Unfortunately for Burroughs, the back cover includes a single blurb comparing him to David Sedaris, and many readers, unable to think for themselves, contrast the two authors and find Burroughs lacking. Other than being gay and funny (and it's insulting that that is all it takes for people to link the two authors), Burroughs and Sedaris have nothing in common--each has his own writing style and a unique sense of humor. It would be just as pertinent to compare him to Ru Paul.<br /><br />The second criticism is that Burroughs reproduces conversations verbatim from thirty years ago. Putting aside the fact that he was able to consult diaries to refresh his memory, this technique is not uncommon. J. R. Ackerley, Annie Dillard, and Philip Roth--to name just three I've read recently--all use the same conceit in their classic memoirs. Burroughs is not as good as these three writers--his prose is a bit austere, and the book teeters on the edge of John Waters-inspired camp. Nevertheless, criticism of &#34;recreated&#34; dialogue seems gratuitous: any detail in any autobiography can be censured on the same grounds. Burroughs quite successfully recreates for the reader certain episodes of his life--episodes no human being would have been able to forget--and the exact wording of recalled dialogue matters as much as the exact color of the polyester shirt he was wearing at the time.<br /><br />Regardless of its faults (both real and alleged), the book is vivid proof that Burroughs emerged from his past with a profound sense of dignity. In a recent interview, he said of the older man who sexually abused him: &#34;Mostly I still feel an incredible rage that he would do that to a young person, but just as much as I feel that rage I feel sorry for him, because he was someone who was mentally ill and had the most atrocious therapist possible.&#34; This quote alone displays his uncanny ability to step back and reflect detachedly on his experiences and to be both empathetic and sympathetic even towards those who deserve his venom. Some readers will be disturbed by Burroughs's ability to laugh (and make us laugh) at what happened to him. Yet thebook probably would have unbearable otherwise--and, if it weren't for his sense of humor, it's unlikely the author would be around to tell us his story at all.d, if it weren't for his sense of humor, it's unlikely the author would be around to tell us his story at all.	2003-03-17

Motion, an acclaimed poet and biographer, alternates the fictional narrative (in the form of a \\"confession\\" by the subject himself) with \\"notes\\" detailing what the historical record actually seems to say. The notes are not merely documentary evidence; instead, they are fragments that, together, form a sort of rough draft for a traditional biography.<br />The experiment is a qualified success. Since there exists far more invention about Wainewright than fact, the format does allow Motion the opportunity both to imagine a life through the subject's own eyes and to present far more speculation than he could in a traditional biography. Still, this is the first time I've found a book's notes more captivating than the text. Furthermore, the patience of many a reader will be tried by the constant flipping back and forth between the fictional narrative and the supporting material, which is fairly necessary to understand what's going on.<br />The appeal of this volume, ultimately, will depend on the reader's interest in the character of Wainewright himself, and especially in the man's apparently infinite self-regard. In an 1867 biographical account, Walter Thornbury called Wainewright an \\"insufferable fop,\\" and Oscar Wilde characterized Wainewright as \\"a young dandy [who] sought to be somebody rather than do something.\\" Motion's account supports both of these assessments quite solidly.<br />Part of the allure of Wainewright's story has always been the prominence of the company he kept; he was friends or acquaintances with several of the Romantic poets (particular Blake), as well as artists Henry Fuseli and Theodore von Holst and \\"London Magazine\\" regulars Charles Lamb, Thomas de Quincey, and William Hazlitt. Although Motion offers a passable account of the history of the magazine and the writing that appeared in its pages, including Wainewright's own meager contributions, he provides only one or two fictional paragraphs--and a complementary note--portraying each of the major figures in this milieu. Since I was led to believe (or perhaps I presumed) that the book would offer a broader survey of the Romantic crowd, I found these cursory portraits rather disappointing.<br />Ultimately, though, Wainewright himself is a third-rate Romantic writer and a deservedly neglected painter. Motion's experiment attempts to raise questions about the nature of biography, and he examines in an afterword how the facts, suppositions, and grotesque inventions surrounding Wainewright's life and crimes captured the Victorian imagination. The fascination with his notoriety continues to this day: it's not for nothing that Motion calls his book \\"Wainewright the Poisoner\\" rather than \\"Wainewright the Romantic.\\" Yet, if Bulwer Lytton, Dickens, Wilde, and other writers (including Motion) had not demonized Wainewright or embellished his misdeeds, then surely the man would have been little more than a footnote in surveys of the Romantic period--if that. Motion never seems to concede that Wainewright's ignominy has in fact given both his art and his writing a longevity it doesn't deserve, and this book adds to the legend as much as it clarifies it.n Holst and \\"London Magazine\\" regulars Charles Lamb, Thomas de Quincey, and William Hazlitt.

This territory has been mined so often (and continues to dominate the debut efforts of many up-and-coming novelists) that established writers dare to trespass in this realm only if they could deliver something unique. Unfortunately, \\"Boulevard\\" is anything but.<br />Grimsley is a confident writer whose prose is unadorned and meticulous, but his writing can't save the hackneyed plot. The novel's central character, Newell, leaves small-town Alabama, and the novel's first page (correction: the first sentence!) describes him getting off the bus in New Orleans in 1976. This B-novel cliche is followed by 120 pages of formula--first time going to a gay bar, first sniff of amyl nitrate, first joint, first visit to a pornographic bookstore (where Newell ultimately lands a job), first sexual encounter, etc.<br />In addition, there are flaccid descriptions of famous French Quarter landmarks that could have been lifted from Fodor's. The prose here is so detached, so cynical, so clinical that it conveys no emotional impact: at one point, Newell reflects on his first night of drinking and dancing as a \\"nice evening\\" of \\"pleasant places\\"--an impression that the previous twenty pages absolutely does not convey. It's hard to say if Grimsley means to suggest that Newell is a vapid reporter of his so-called life or if he means to condemn the excesses of gay life in New Orleans.<br />After this first chapter, \\"Boulevard\\" takes a sharp turn and hints at what this novel could have been. Grimsley shifts the story's style and point of view: first to Miss Sophia, an older, schizophrenic transsexual who works with Newell in the bookstore, then to Mark, Newell's drug-addled boyfriend, and a final chapter (as well as a coda of sorts) that, with whiplash rapidity, switches perspectives among the several characters introduced throughout the book. Interspersed is a journal written by a nineteenth-century neighbor of a notorious woman who imprisoned and tortured her slaves.<br />As others have noted, the chapter about Miss Sophia seems entirely out of place in this novel, but I thought it daring and believable; on its own, it would have made a great short story or the kernel of another novel altogether. As a whole, however, these last three chapters don't attempt to make the characters more believable (they certainly don't illuminate the reasons for Newell's sudden downfall and his equally sudden epiphany at the end of the book), and they tantalize the reader with the silhouette of an entirely different--and possibly better--novel.e, then to Mark, Newell's drug-addled boyfriend, and a final chapter (as well as a coda of sorts) that, with whiplash rapidity, switches perspectives among the several characters introduced throughout the book.

I admit I couldn't put it down, and I certainly laughed out loud on several occasions. Yet, like a television comedy you just can't stop watching in spite of yourself, Dunn's sophomore effort will undoubtedly fade quickly from memory.<br />The novel follows the adventures of a large number of Higby's residents over Labor Day weekend in 1993, and there are some truly crazy and truly troubled and truly loveable people in this town. The kind but insecure Euless Ludlam and the homely and lonely Carmen Valentine are certainly favorites, while the put-upon and illiterate (but fully reformed) ex-convict Bowmar Stambler can be my neighbor anytime.<br />Another reviewer's rant disparaging the \\"stock characters\\" isn't in the least fair: In what Southern town would these people be cliches? To cite just one example, I didn`t fully realize until halfway through the book that the Leigh sisters, neither of whom match any type I've ever imagined, were \\"people of color\\" (to use the author's expression). Yes, the plot may be predictable--a bit too predictable, in fact--but the characters, their beliefs, and their behaviors certainly are not. Still, I agree that the novel occasionally go so far over the top that it turns from sitcom to farce: a vegan fundamentalist Christian cult that kidnaps wayward drunks and imprisons them until they become complacent believers? What's the point?<br />If you`re looking for an undemanding, eccentric romp, you may well enjoy the hijinks of the inhabitants of Higby. It's a nice place to visit...	2003-02-27

Vernant starts with the creation stories; skims through the \\"clash of the titans,\\" Prometheus and Pandora, the Trojan War, Odysseus, Dionysus, Oedipus; and ends quite abruptly with Perseus and Medusa--all in 180 sparse pages. Along the way, the author strips these stories of all their depth, drama, and momentum. Entire battle scenes and plot twists are reduced to single sentences. His effort to make Greek mythology simple is unforgivably simplistic; all the excitement is thoroughly excised. Vernant has managed to achieve something I would have thought impossible: he has made Greek mythology dreadfully boring.<br /><br />It's never really quite clear for whom this book was written. Much of the writing (or at least its translation) reads like excerpts from an elementary school primer. Instead of proper transitional devices, sentences repeatedly begin with \\"So.\\" \\"So now the war of the gods is over.\\" \\"And so they sail on, the fleet much reduced.\\" \\"So then: Athena and Hermes help the boy with the feat he must accomplish.\\" One-dimensional answers follow condescending questions: \\"How does Prometheus do it? The way it is routinely done in Greek sacrifice.\\" \\"Who is Helen? She is herself the fruit of the gods' intrusions into the human world.\\" \\"What does the ingenious captain do? He has got himself some beeswax.\\" Why does Vernant write like this? I haven't a clue.<br /><br />Although Vernant came up with the idea for this book when he told Greek myths as bedtime stories to his grandson, this book can't possibly be intended for children or even adolescents: these skeletal stories would enchant no one, and there isn't enough background for those unfamiliar with Greek myths to make any sense of what remains. Furthermore, I can't imagine that children would understand his reference to \\"a 1968-style rebellion on Olympus\\" or that they would care how Professor Louis Gernet sees Dionysus as \\"the figure of the other\\" or how Marcel Detienne views him as \\"an epidemic god.\\" At the same time, older readers looking for new insights into Greek mythology will surely be disappointed; Vernant's analysis never dips below the surface. On Pandora: \\"Woman combines the vileness of human life together with its divine aspect.\\"  On Achilles: \\"In the full flesh of combat, of youth, the manly strengths of bravura and energy and youthful grace intact will thus never know the decrepitude of old age.\\" On Oedipus: \\"In any city where there are women and men, there is a necessary opposition and a necessary entanglement of combat and marriage.\\" (As opposed to those many cities where there are only women or only men?)<br /><br />The final insult to the reader is the book's 20-page appendix, which lists a motley assortment of Greek gods and heroes. The entries nearly always omit the importance of each character to the mythical tradition and focus overwhelmingly on family relations (which would more clearly and succintly served by a genealogical chart). Thus, Echion is \\"one of the five Spartoi; husband of Agave, father of Pentheus.\\" Agave is \\"daughter of Cadmus and mother of Pentheus.\\" Pentheus is \\"grandson of Cadmus on his mother's, Agave's side, and son of Echion.\\" Are you dizzy yet?<br /><br />In sum, readers interested in an introduction to Greek mythology would profit far more from Thomas Bulfinch's \\"The Age of Fable,\\" Edith Hamilton's \\"Mythology,\\" or Robert Graves's \\"The Greek Myths.\\" (For younger readers, I would recommend Bernard Evslin's \\"Heroes, Gods, and Monsters of the Greek Myths\\" or the still-classic pair, \\"A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls\\" and \\"Tanglewood Tales,\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne.)how Marcel Detienne views him as \\"an epidemic god.\\" At the same time, older readers looking for new insights into Greek mythology will surely be disappointed; Vernant's analysis never dips below the surface.

Like most war stories, the plotting is at times necessarily predictable (yet still thrilling), but Monsarrat's epic is a cut above in both its human element (even in its occasional depiction of Germans) and in its presentation of the morally gray aspects of war. This is no ode to blind patriotism. Instead, the novel is an elegy on the selfless bravery and selfish survival instincts of a group of sailors whose reasons for being in the war are as varied as the men themselves: the stern but fair-minded Lieutenant-Commander Ericson, the indolent and tyrannical (and somewhat comical) First Lieutenant Bennett, the nervous and self-doubting Sub-Lieutenant Ferraby, the level-headed and thoughtful Sub-Lieutenant Lockhart (who, I would guess, is Monsarrat's alter ego), and a supporting cast of dozens. There are some spine-chilling and devastating battle scenes, but the book never once loses its focus: the men (and women) who fought and endured the war.<br />Another surprising aspect of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is its intense lyricism. There are many sentences and descriptions that linger in the mind long after one has finished the novel. The death a crew member: \\"He did not exactly surrender to the sea, but he stopped caring much whether he lived or died; and on this night, an ambiguous will was not enough.\\" An officer finding out his girlfriend is pregnant: \\"The child would be the occasion of their marriage, not the cause for it.\\" Equally impressive is the novel's unusual wit--humor far beyond the stereotypical bawdiness of sailors: the friendly banter between crew members, the scrapes between men on leave and family members or other civilians, the hilarious clash of cultures when the frigate is docked for repairs in New York City.<br />Generally, I am averse to \\"war novels\\" (with the exceptions of the usual famous classics); I'd rather read the real thing--journalism or history--and forego the shallow characterizations and poor writing so common to the genre of military fiction.

Heavily indebted to the Gilded Age novelists, \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" reads like a typical first novel from a writer who shows a lot of promise.<br />Later in life, Cather wrote an essay entitled \\"My First Novels (There Were Two),\\" as close to an apology for a first novel as most writers ever make. She admitted that most of the \\"younger writers\\" in her peer group followed the manner of Henry James and Edith Wharton, \\"without having their qualifications\\"; she \\"thought a book should be made out of 'interesting material.'\\" Only while writing her next novel, \\"O Pioneers!,\\" did she realize that \\"taking a ride through a familiar country\\"--the rural Nebraska of her youth--was \\"a much more absorbing process.\\" Nevertheless, \\"Alexander's Bridge\\" hints at the virtuoso novelist she was later to become, and it's certainly better than many writers achieve in an entire lifetime.	2003-02-13

Gardner is brilliant, and his writing is compelling, extremely witty, and easy to understand. In many ways, it should be required reading for anyone interested in \\"fringe\\" movements, but readers should understand that, as a whole, the book has some shortcomings inherent in these sorts of collections.<br />Some of the articles in \\"The New Age\\" provide convincing refutations of the topic under discussion, while other essays preach to the converted. Occasionally, he hits a bull's-eye: his essay on certain televangelists, written after the revelations about the Bakkers and before Swaggart's fall from grace, provides much information that is incriminating enough to push fence-sitting readers onto the greener side of skepticism. Other articles are valuable purely for historical reasons, such as his survey of perpetual motion machines. All too often, though, it feels like Gardner is shooting ducks in a very small barrel: easy targets, but bordering on the pathetic. One might argue that these articles are necessary because so many people believe in such garbage, but I can't imagine, for example, that his mocking summaries on the preposterous metaphysics expounded by Shirley MacLaine would convince anyone gullible enough to believe her in the first place. His chapters on the actress rarely offer direct refutation of her outlandish claims or point out their many contradictions.<br />The second deficiency is far more serious. Like many writers who collect their essays, Gardner has opted for reprinting the essays as they were written rather than rewriting them into a coherent and fluid whole. (His concession to the reader is to publish an afterword to each essay that reprints responses and updates information.) The problem with this unenterprising approach is twofold: since many of the essays were written on related or similar topics for disparate audiences, there is a lot of repetition, and the book bounces back and forth among subjects with no sense of direction. As a result, we read no less than four times, in nearly the same prose, about physicist John Taylor's testing of Uri Geller's \\"spoon-bending\\" trick, twice about Robert Browning's skepticism towards D. D. Home's seances, and so on. Likewise, instead of one chapter on Shirley MacLaine, we get two (three if you count the chapter on channeling), repeating much of the same information and placed in different parts of the book.<br />The final problem with the book is no fault of Gardner's: many of the essays are simply outdated--particularly those on borderline physics (such as superstring theory and the unsupported claims of Thomas Gold and Halton C. Arp, whose fifteen minutes are pretty much up). In fact, in 1996 Gardner published a sequel, \\"Weird Water and Fuzzy Logic,\\" which I'm now eager to read.<br />Even though I've highlighted the negative aspects of this work, Gardner's analysis is trenchant and authoritative. Reading these essays made me realize that we need a \\"debunker's almanac\\"--an annual collection keeping up with the latest scams. In the meantime, I've ordered a subscription to \\"The Skeptical Inquirer.\\"tes information.)

Inspired by this and other ideas, Fernandez-Armesto here defines and organizes civilizations by \\"their systematic refashioning of nature.\\"<br />Spanning over ten millennia, proceeding from tundra societies to maritime empires, and incorporating histories both obscure and familiar, \\"Civilizations\\" is a cornucopia of minutiae and generalizations, and the breadth of Fernandez-Armesto's reading and knowledge is staggering. Since he covers hundreds of societies, many get only a page or two while others get more detailed treatment, and the encyclopedic aspect of this work can be both exhilarating and overwhelming. (Readers lacking a historical atlas will probably find the lack of maps quite frustrating.) The book works best when the author is making a point or telling a story, as when he takes the reader on a tour of the wonders of the classical (Greek) world, when he discusses both the inflated significance and the true accomplishments of Vasco da Gama, or when he focuses, in the book's final chapters, on the importance of maritime history (his specialization) during the last thousand years. \\"Civilizations\\" falters a bit, however, when Fernandez-Armesto sketches cultures with which he seems to have a passing knowledge (Songhay, New Guineau, the Mound Builders). In some of these sections, the prose reads like a series of observations transcribed or paraphrased from a sequence of those index cards favored by researchers. Still, some of those index cards are pretty darn interesting.<br />Fernandez-Armesto admits that this comparative study is \\"an experimental work,\\" \\"rough-hewn,\\" written \\"in something like a frenzy.\\" Although I didn't think that its slapdash character was particularly wearisome, the book does contain some sloppy, imprecise statements that a second draft would have thrashed into submission.  During his discussion of the Atlantic slave trade during the early modern period, for example, the author writes what he simply cannot mean: \\"It is not even clear what abolitionists found morally repugnant about slavery: they let other forms of exploitation, including coolie abuse, sweatshops, and convict labor succeed it.\\" Putting aside the glib anachronisms in this sentence, the ambiguous \\"let\\" in this sentence demands clarification: abolitionists of the late 1700s and early 1800s were no more responsible for \\"coolie labor\\" or sweatshops than Einstein could have been for \\"letting\\" Hiroshima and Chernobyl happen.<br />There are a number of carelessly worded and unsupported gaffes like this one, made in the \\"frenzy\\" of getting it all down, and the author doesn't always package his assortment of assertions and abundance of data into a cohesive whole. Fortunately these shortcomings don't overwhelm the merits of this sweeping, information-packed historical survey.study is \\"an experimental work,\\" \\"rough-hewn,\\" written \\"in something like a frenzy.\\" Although I didn't think that its slapdash character was particularly wearisome, the book does contain some sloppy, imprecise statements that a second draft would have thrashed into submission.

In this new world, technological advances maintain recently departed citizens in \\"half life,\\" a temporary state of suspended animation, and commercial moratoriums provide access to loved ones until they eventually pass on to their next full life.<br />Glen Runciter is co-owner, with his half-dead (or half-alive) wife, of the leading anti-psi firm. He and his assistant, Joe Chip, find themselves challenged by new, even more sinister forces they don't quite understand. Some of the members of their firm seem to have died in an act of sabotage, but which ones? Who's responsible? What is Ubik, the aerosol spray that claims to do everything (when used as directed)? And why is time regressing to 1939? Every clue seems to be a red herring, and the \\"truth\\" isn't revealed until the very end--or is it?<br />As others have noted, Dick's writing is characteristically featureless (a minimalist, almost pulp-fiction style), but the intricacies of the page-turning plot more than compensate for the pedestrianism. Published in 1969, \\"Ubik\\" still entertains while it scrutinizes (and lampoons) both crass commercialism and metaphysics. On the one hand, the omnipresence of advertising and pay-per-use dispensers is dead-on satire in a century where we've become seemingly immune to paying a couple of bucks for a bottle of water with a fancy label on it. (Perpetually in debt, Joe Chip has to pay every time he opens his refrigerator, uses the shower, and enters--or leaves--his apartment, which leads to some pretty hilarious dilemmas.) On the other hand, how seriously you take the \\"philosophy\\" presented in this book might depend on your beliefs in the afterlife and/or reincarnation (not for nothing does Dick refer twice to the \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\"). But even if such metaphysical concepts aren't your thing, you can still sit back and enjoy the ride.ibetan Book of the Dead\\").

The result is a free-for-all clash of intellects, a confrontation between faith and reason, and the inevitable battle of the sexes.<br />The marvels of Adams's novel are his remarkably nuanced and fully realized characters. Esther, the free-thinker, wants to share her lover's faith and \\"is trying to get it by reason\\"--but doesn't initially understand that a person \\"can never reason yourself into it.\\" Mr. Hazard, the minister, is confident that he will \\"succeed in drawing her into the fold, because his lifelong faith, that all human energies belonged to the church, was on trial, and, if it broke down in a test so supreme as that of marriage, the blow would go far to prostrate him forever.\\" Esther's principles of independence and self-education collide with Hazard's desire to steer her into submission as his wife and fellow believer.<br />But my favorite character is relegated to a supporting role: Catherine, a recent transplant from the frontiers of Colorado, befriends Esther and dazzles New York society with her innocence, naivete, and sincerity. It's never really quite clear, however, whether her simplicity is the genuine article or just a show mocking the pretensions of her admirers. As one of the intellectuals who lightheartedly teases her wonders, there was \\"a little doubt whether she was making fun of him or he of her, and she never left him in perfect security on this point.\\"<br />The novel sparkles with banter and quarrels, jokes and ripostes, but any attempt to reproduce the humor in a short review would fall flat: Adams's witticisms are dependent upon context and character. Still, I caught myself laughing out loud often at the book's cleverness and hilarity.	2003-01-31
US	41905526	R3TLTJU9WU1K08	0425181642	894540459	E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation	Books	4	4	6	N	Y	Relativity made relatively simple	Bodanis has written a fun-to-read and concise guide outlining the history and impact of the world's most famous equation. He opens with an inspired conceit: Cameron Diaz once said, quite seriously, that she wish she knew what the equation meant, and he wrote this book for the curious, intelligent reader who, like Diaz, has little or no background (or even interest) in science and wants to understand Einstein's discovery.<br />Any book about physics and math that has such an audience in mind risks--indeed, requires--oversimplification. The prose is often so folksy that those of us used to reading more scholarly material will find it a bit annoying, yet even these passages show that the author is truly enjoying his material and wants to convey that enjoyment to his readers. Similarly, nitpickers are sure to have a field day finding inaccuracies and omissions. For example, Bodanis states that an object swells, or gains mass, as its speed approaches the speed of light; in a very lengthy note he admits that this description is only metaphor (and a misleading one at that). Yet, if he had avoided this metaphor and included the more accurate description contained in the note, he certainly would have lost his audience. In this case, I think, Bodanis has made the right decision: a vague or incomplete understanding is certainly better than no understanding at all.<br />In spite of its intentional simplicity, the book relates a number of interesting biographical tidbits that were unfamiliar to me, particularly about Voltaire's lover, Emile du Chatelet, and the unjustly neglected Lise Meitner, who, by fleeing Nazi Germany, was ultimately robbed of a Nobel Prize. Bodanis makes science, with its back-stabbing egos and generous celebrities, come alive. In addition, unlike many other histories of science, Bodanis does not overlook the importance of religious beliefs in stimulating (and occasionally blinding) scientists, especially Faraday and Einstein.<br />This book also contains a much-needed and concise answer to Heisenberg's apologists. Make no mistake: Heisenberg was a brilliant scientist and he clearly realized later in life that he was on the wrong side, but it seems incontrovertible that he collaborated with the Nazis. The book to read, as Bodanis notes, is \\"Hitler's Uranium Club\\"; its transcripts of secret recordings of Heisenberg's own words belie his later claim that he was trying to thwart the Nazi attempt to create the bomb. Bodanis's appendix includes a sample of the overwhelming and irrefutable evidence against Heisenberg. (Heisenberg's sympathizers often praise \\"Copenhagen.\\" This play, by Michael Frayn, describes a meeting between Heisenberg and Neil Bohrs that both men recalled years later in conflicting accounts, and it consists entirely of imagined dialogue. Although an indisputably brilliant dramatic work, \\"Copenhagen\\" is in essence a work of fiction, since nobody knows for sure what was said or even why the two men really met--as Frayn himself notes in his postscript to the published play. In addition, \\"Copenhagen\\" is based on Thomas Powers's biography of Heisenberg, which appeared before the publication of \\"Hitler's Uranium Club.\\")<br />These stories, details, and debates are just a small part of the wealth of information David Bodanis has managed to pack into a slim volume. The appendix, notes, and suggestions for further reading, which amounts to a full third of the book, are not to be missed: not only do they clarify many points covered cursorily in the text, but they are often quite amusing and will surely spur readers to investigate further a number of topics.much-needed and concise answer to Heisenberg's apologists.

To earn extra income, he tutors students on the side, but he constantly and unsuccessfully struggles to make ends meet, and he falls in love with one of his students.<br />While this is certainly familiar literary terrain, Samrat Upadahyay's debut novel is distinctive for its Kathmandu setting, social milieu, and religious elements. Featuring prose that is emotionally reserved and stylistically brusque, the book excels at portraying a middle-class protagonist, including his guilt whenever he spends money on frivolous luxuries, his remorse when he cheats on his wife, and the drudgery of his workaday world.<br />The same can't be said for the rest of the characters, who sometimes border on cardboard cutouts. There are the nasty in-laws, who regard Ramchandra as an inferior match for their daughter. There is his mistress, Maliti, whose motives are shallow and whose passions seem capricious. And there is Ramchandra's wife, Goma, a compassionate, suffering saint who overcomes her initial anger over the affair and resorts to a surprising solution to accommodate her husband's mistress.<br />Although Goma is certainly likeable (what saint isn't?), the author presents absolutely nothing in Goma's character or background that would make this aspect of the story even remotely believable. Much of this subplot struck me as fanciful, because its representation resembled a midlife fantasy instead of a midlife crisis. True--married men everywhere have affairs and their wives accept them back, but how many wives are so bizarrely tolerant of their husband's transgressions?<br />The novel is also strewn with passages relating the social and political upheaval in Nepal. The purpose of these passages, while informative, is never really clear. Upadhyay might be contrasting everyday personal travails with political and social disorder (\\"My personal problems are my country's problems,\\" Ramchandra says at one point), but the comparison seems superficial and the disconnectedness of these episodes is often jarring.<br />Nevertheless, the book is never boring, and the depictions of the Dashain festival and religious rituals are captivating. Much, much more happens in the novel, and in many ways it redeems itself in the final chapters.blems,\\" Ramchandra says at one point), but the comparison seems superficial and the disconnectedness of these episodes is often jarring.<br />Nevertheless, the book is never boring, and the depictions of the Dashain festival and religious rituals are captivating.

I am now scolding myself for my narrow-mindedness: sometimes you can't judge a book even by its subject.<br />Although as quickly paced as a thriller, \\"Seabiscuit\\" should not be appraised (or read) as a literary work or a historical treatise. Laura Hillenbrand's style and background is journalistic, and this book is one of the best works of sports journalism ever published. (This has to rank also as one of the most humorous works of non-fiction I've ever read.) She gives just enough historical background and just enough racing fundamentals for general readers, but her focus is on the rags-to-riches story of the horse and its very human owner, trainer, and jockeys. What gives the narrative particular resonance is her ability to provide the unique background and importance of each significant race, and the story is greatly helped by the fact that Seabiscuit was far from invincible: you are never quite sure which races will be won and which will be lost.<br />Judging from the notes, the book seems extremely well researched, using an astonishing variety of interviews, books, magazine articles, and long-lost newspaper clippings. (The book is also well documented, with citations to back up every quotation and arcane fact.) And, finally, the paperback edition concludes with an interview with the author, which provides a valuable backdrop for the creation of the book itself.	2003-01-27

The book was so shocking for its time (1953) that its publisher censored portions of the writing and peppered it with parenthetical disclaimers. The book starkly tells the story, based largely on Burroughs's own experiences, of the life of a junky--or, more accurately, how a junky's life revolves around nothing but junk.<br />While the book is disquieting and dispassionate--and it's certainly more accessible than Burroughs's other works--it is interesting more as a historical document rather than a literary treasure. Much of the book (and not simply, as others have pointed out, the language) is dated. We, as readers, have become somewhat immune to such portrayals, and the shock value and aesthetic appeal of Burroughs's debut has been diminished over time by not only the works of other authors but also his own later works.<br />The book's narrative is too disjointed to feel like a \\"novel,\\" in part because Burroughs is so didactic. He correctly assumes that readers in the 1950s will know little if anything about drug culture, and his narrative is interrupted by lecture-like sections. While he pulls no punches in his bleak depiction of addiction, he boasts some acutely ill-informed opinions (for example, his claim that cocaine is not addictive: \\"once the C [cocaine] is out of your system, you forget all about it. There is no habit to C.\\")<br />And \\"Junky\\" should not be read as entirely accurate autobiography. Although Burroughs never glamorizes addiction or its effects, his narrative does embark on an extraordinary episode of wishful thinking. During a particularly nasty binge in Mexico City, his wife intervened, throwing his spoon and drugs on the floor; in retaliation, he \\"slapped her twice across the face.\\" In the book, a few days later they separated, and she was living happily in Acapulco. In real life, however, during a similar dispute, Burroughs shot and killed Joan Vollmer--an event that damaged his reputation and haunted his reasoning for the rest of his years.<br />Yet, in spite of its obsolete style and its disjointed narrative, its didacticism and its half-truths, \\"Junky\\" is still a powerful reminder of the monomania of addiction.\\"slapped her twice across the face.\\" In the book, a few days later they separated, and she was living happily in Acapulco.

While depicting Pennyfeather's downward trajectory, Waugh skewers the pretensions and mocks the hypocrisy of every class of British society. Although I trust Waugh did not mean for the reader to sympathize with Pennyfeather, who is truly an apathetic oaf, I (ironically) found him surprisingly likable.<br />Blameless throughout, Pennyweather resignedly and almost eagerly accepts punishment for crimes committed by others. (In prison, he positively enjoys solitary confinement for its regimen and its lack of stress.) Some of Waugh's commentary is a bit pedestrian, especially to modern readers, but he occasionally and fearlessly tackles weighty and \\"scandalous\\" themes: the apostasy of the clergy (\\"modern churchmen who drew their pay without the necessity of the commitment to any religious belief\\"), the excesses of the prison reform movement (\\"So far as possible, I like the prisoners to carry on with their avocations in civilized life. What's this man's profession, officer?\\" \\"White Slave traffic, sir.\\"), and societal attitudes towards an aristocratic lady who takes a black American lover (and her own patronizing posture). This last subplot, it must be said, makes uncomfortable reading, because the black character barely rises above stereotype, because Waugh unflinchingly uses racial epithet, and because ultimately the reader is not quite sure where Waugh is coming from.<br />Much of Waugh's satire is dated, but (like Candide) Paul Pennyweather is a virtuous nobody whose misadventures transcend time. The edition from Everyman Library also includes an astute introduction from the critic Frank Kermode, who provides useful background for the book instead of assuming you've already read it.	2003-01-19

As Wright notes in his introduction, however, since his investigation is also a survey of mass adolescent culture, he properly focuses on \\"popular\\" commercial magazines--especially on superhero-themed comics--to the exclusion of newspaper funnies (like Dick Tracy and Li'l Abner), underground comics and graphic novels (such as works by R. Crumb and Daniel Clowes), and cartoon series for children (Archie and the Disney characters).<br />Painstakingly researched, \\"Comic Book Nation\\" is really three books in one. Wright provides both plot outlines and summaries of trends in subject matter, from the launch of Superman to the sinister underworld of the Watchmen. He also places those themes and developments in the larger cultural context, from Depression-era longings and liberalism, through the patriotism induced by World War II and the Cold War, to the anti-crime vigilantism of the Reagan era. Finally, he charts the multiple peaks and valleys experienced by the business itself: its unpredictable sales patterns, the unhappiness of its work force, the rise and fall of the largest publishers, and the takeover of the industry by corporate and licensing interests. Along the way, he examines the 1940s and 1950s backlash against the violent and sexual nature of comic books (which resulted in the Comics Code Authority, an agency of censorship unparalleled in its broad sweep and its power); the heyday of EC Comics, purveyor of classics ranging from \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" to \\"Mad Magazine\\"; and the brilliant, original creation of \\"Spider-Man\\" and the succeeding generation of reluctant, misunderstood heroes.<br />Wright wisely avoids making aesthetic judgments, and it's a tribute to his objectivity that readers would have a difficult time figuring out which series rank among the author's own favorites. Likewise, although Wright's left-of-center political judgments are on display throughout (and I confess I often found myself in agreement with him), he is consistently even-handed and empathetic when discussing the advocates of censorship (like Fredric Wertham) and the creators of more \\"patriotic\\" and even propagandistic comic books (such as Charlton Publications).<br />Not having read a superhero-themed comic book in years, I admit I was drawn to buy and read this book by Michael Chabon's \\"Kavalier and Clay,\\" and I can confirm that this is a great book for readers of that novel who want to learn more. Although I imagine that some comic book fans (especially young readers) might find Wright's study long on analysis and short on comics, \\"Comic Book Nation\\" is truly a seminal contribution to the field of culture studies.re on display throughout (and I confess I often found myself in agreement with him), he is consistently even-handed and empathetic when discussing the advocates of censorship (like Fredric Wertham) and the creators of more \\"patriotic\\" and even propagandistic comic books (such as Charlton Publications).<br />Not having read a superhero-themed comic book in years, I admit I was drawn to buy and read this book by Michael Chabon's \\"Kavalier and Clay,\\" and I can confirm that this is a great book for readers of that novel who want to learn more.

Mei-Li's childhood and early adulthood is spent as a renowned (if fraudulent) spiritualist wunderkind, a period which begins with the San Francisco earthquake and continues through the First World War and influenza epidemic to the advent of radio. During the 1920s, Mei-Li leaves her first profession and establishes a utopian (and ultimately dystopian!) community south of the Bay area. These first two sections are truly novel.<br />In the last two parts, Bryant retreads familiar literary ground. Mei-Li's Depression-era experiences are very much like Steinbeck's novels (both \\"In Dubious Battle\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"), yet, like many other works of Depression-era proletarian fiction (such as Alexander Saxton's \\"The Great Midland\\"), it is more representative of the non-white ethnic mix of American labor. Eventually, Mei-Li ends her life in an asylum for the mentally ill, in a section that exposes the injustices of these institutions while simultaneously displaying the humanity that can flourish within their walls. Mei-Li's various episodes and adventures, while seemingly unconnected, conspire to trigger the novel's one big plot twist--and I can't say anything else without ruining the surprise<br />As J. J. Wilson notes in her afterword, the novel is \\"admirably well-researched,\\" and the result is a fascinating historical panorama. The narrative is always absorbing and occasionally suspenseful, yet the story is rarely emotional or sentimental; Mei-Li relates the death of a lover with the same matter-of-fact tone she uses to describe one of her fraudulent seances. Often this works in the book's favor, but at times the meticulous research and academic tone nearly overwhelm the drama. Even Wilson admits that Bryant \\"chose a difficult path in putting her Psyche in charge of her own narrative. . . . Mei-Li reports events with little comment.\\"<br />In spite of this weakness, Mei-Li's story is faithfully and believably depicted, and there is much wisdom and beauty in Bryant's epic novel.e comment.\\"<br />In spite of this weakness, Mei-Li's story is faithfully and believably depicted, and there is much wisdom and beauty in Bryant's epic novel.	2003-01-13

In the first part, while China is suffering from the final attacks of the Japanese invaders at the end of World War II, Mulberry is a teenage runaway stranded with other refugees on a boat caught in the rapids of the Yangtse River. A few years later, she is trapped in Peking with her fiance and his dying mother as the Communists surround the city. In the late 1950s, Mulberry is imprisoned in an attic in Taiwan, hiding from the authorities who are seeking her husband on embezzlement charges. And, in the final section, she has emigrated to the United States, where she is being pursued by the INS and haunted by her other identity, Peach.<br /><br />Mulberry's plight is, at best, bleak, but Nieh manages to balance an astonishing sense of humor with the description of the calamities and isolation faced by her protagonist. Hauntingly written and beautifully translated, the novel can be read on many levels: historical and cultural allegory, political satire, a treatise on the immigrant's schizophrenic experience, a commentary on Eastern and Western sexual mores and gender identity. As a bonus, Sau-ling Cynthia Wong's discerning afterword amplifies these and other themes and provides useful background for understanding the novel, but (fortunately) &#34;Mulberry and Peach&#34; will be immediately accessible to any reader.	2003-01-09

Pears has written a thoroughly convincing historical mystery that kept me guessing until the very satisfying climax; the equally perplexing mystery is why so many readers feel they must spoil the fun. (And, in spite of the small minority who thought otherwise, I found the book thrilling to read--I could hardly put it down.)<br />Pears recreates England after the death of Oliver Cromwell, during the reign of Charles II: he faithfully reproduces its political intrigues, philosophical disputes, and social milieu. Most of the characters were actual celebrities at the time (John Locke, Robert Boyle, Christopher Wren), the few fictional creations are based on historical figures, and many of the events important both to the plot and to the atmosphere actually occurred. Most impressively, Pears manages to fit his mystery (or mysteries, since there are several unsolved-to-the-very-end threads) within the actual achievements or fiascos, the rise or decline of each of the historical figures he portrays.<br />Like the four gospels they (purposefully) mirror, the novel is told in four parts, and Pears's style serves him well. Each section is narrated in turn by an Italian dilettante, a disenfranchised young man, a boorish xenophobe, and a reclusive bookworm--in other words, a representative cross-section of the inhabitants of Oxford--and the unique characters shine through the prose. True to the formula for this type of mystery, each character's story has important omissions and evasions about his own role but tells what he believes is the complete truth about everyone else. There are few false notes in this novel's rich, complicated plot, and even those can be explained by the narrow agendas of the four leading characters. Pears rewards attentive readers not only with a spellbinding yarn but also with a witty lesson in history and philosophy.	2003-01-07

Regardless of the title, Wodehouse's 1947 novel is a superb comedy of language and manners (or lack thereof), in which both screwball and slapstick enhance the absurd situations Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves create for themselves.<br />The supporting characters are marvelously drawn. There's Florence Craye, \\"one of those intellectual girls, steeped to the gills in serious purpose, who are unable to see a male soul without wanting to get behind it and shove,\\" and her jealous fiance Stilton Cheesewright, \\"one of those touchy lovers who go about the place in a suspicious and red-eyed spirit, eager to hammer the stuffing out of such of the citizenry as they suppose to be or to have been in any sense matey with the adored object.\\" The disheveled writer Boko Fittleworth looks like \\"a cross between a comedy juggler and a parrot that has been dragged through a hedge backwards.\\" Florence's brother Edwin is a Boy Scout with a \\"kink in his psychology which made him such a menace to society\\"; her father is \\"one of those men you meet sometimes who only listen to about two words of any observation addressed to them.\\"<br />Even the characters who never once make an appearance add to the delirium. A victim of various intrigues executed by main characters, the American industrialist J. Chichester Clam remains entirely off-stage, \\"probably convinced that all this must be that Collapse of Civilization of which he had no doubt so often spoke at the Union League Club.\\" And the fear of the wrath of the matriarch Aunt Agatha, away visiting her sick son, keeps all the characters in check.<br />This mix of oddballs insures that engagements are broken, property is destroyed, business deals are ruined, and animosities are renewed--and, as always, it falls to Jeeves to set everything right with a mix of luck, connivance, outright deceitfulness, and wisdom culled from Shakespeare (who, according to Bertie, \\"sounds well, but doesn't mean anything\\").

On many levels, their collaborative attempt succeeds admirably: Lichtenstein skillfully (with some elements of a suspenseful detective story) presents her search for David Rodinsky, whose room was rediscovered, virtually untouched, two decades after it had been abandoned, and Sinclair places the story in its many cultural contexts. Yet, in other ways, their narrative falls short: more questions are raised than answered by their book, and Sinclair's contributions occasionally suffer from a parochialism that makes his discussion difficult for the general reader. As Sinclair himself admits, \\"The more the mystery of Rodinsky was discussed and debated, the dimmer the outline of the human presence.\\"<br />The book alternates between chapters by the two authors, and Lichtenstein's contributions are far more straightforward. She weaves her investigation into Rodinsky's identity with her own quest for her Jewish identity and ancestry, and I found her chapters to be far more compelling. Unfortunately, Lichtenstein seems a bit out of her depth when discussing Rodinsky's writings. She confesses she doesn't have the background necessary to understand or translate most of the scraps of papers and journals found in Rodinsky's rooms, yet both she (and Sinclair) repeatedly refer to Rodinsky as a talented linguist and scholar (or a cabbalist). This claim would have been greatly supported by reprinting or summarizing some of the texts left in the room, but we are given only four examples of Rodinsky's apparently prodigious output: two grammatically inept notes to his aunt (including one notable for its venom), the translation of a page of Chinese characters that turns out merely to say \\"I am David Rodinsky\\" over and over, and a journal entry on the study of the Assyrian language that could have been written (stylistic errors and all) by a college freshman. Was Rodinsky truly a scholar and a linguist, or was he just a reclusive dabbler? The evidence presented in the book is hardly convincing either way.<br />Sinclair's nonlinear meditations are also absorbing; he finds parallels to the mystery of Rodinksy in a broad range of literary themes and cultural myths, and he aptly illustrates the East End neighborhood where Rodinsky spent nearly all his life. Although he is a wonderful stylist, Sinclair seems to be writing for his fellow members of the East End literati (and for the critics) rather than for the general reader. Time and again, he mentions London-based semi-celebrities without any introduction whatsoever; I can't imagine many American--or even British--readers knowing most of the people and friends Sinclair mentions. If, before you begin this book, you can't identify Steven Berkoff, David Gascoyne, James Fox, George Melly, John Harle, and dozens of other similarly obscure artists and writers, you will know even less about them after you finish reading Sinclair's chapters. Even better-known writers like Kathy Acker and Arthur Morrison deserve some sort of identification.<br />Furthermore, Sinclair's chapter placing Rodinsky's story within the context of the mythology of the golem seems far-fetched; the parallels just aren't there. Indeed, most of those who knew Rodinsky clearly find this comparison odious (\\"There must be no talk of golems, cabbalists, interdimensional voyages, invisibility,\\" says one. \\"Rodinsky was a man to be pitied, an inadequate [who] unfortunately attained nothing . . . due to his low IQ.\\") But such objections hardly keep Sinclair from attempting to substantiate this analogy for nearly 30 pages.<br />Nevertheless, in spite of my rather significant reservations, I found this book overall to be an affecting celebration of the life of a man who otherwise would be one of the many reclusive loners and social outcasts who disappear in the world on a daily basis.nsky truly a scholar and a linguist, or was he just a reclusive dabbler?

Written in 1895, when Norris was 25, but not published until 1914, after Norris's death, it is an important if uneven precursor to the naturalist tradition in American literature.<br />Young Vandover, a Harvard-educated man-about-town whose chief traits are a lack of ambition and a sense of entitlement, is a San Francisco native who wastes every advantage his privileged life presents to him. Yielding to his inner \\"brute,\\" Vandover gradually descends the rungs of civilized life, losing first his status in \\"proper\\" society and then all his wealth and what remains of his integrity. He suffers from the devastation of self-inflicted scandals, the trauma of a shipwreck during exile, and the ravages of syphilis. Yet Norris doesn't direct his barbs solely at indolent, amoral youth like Vandover; just as reprehensible is the ambitious, double-crossing Charles Geary, one of Vandover's friends, who aims \\"to make his pile in this town and make his way, too.\\" (An interesting aside: unlike most realist fiction, the novel's last sentence ends with a glimmer of hope and a piece of bread--very much like McInerney's \\"Bright Lights, Big City.\\")<br />Although this novel is no longer available on its own in any edition, interested readers will find it included in The Library of America's omnibus collection of Frank Norris's works.	2002-12-08

Many of the elements of the previous novel are here--Lauren's genetic ability to feel the actual pain of others' experiences, the collapse of the U. S. government and its economy--but there is much new. Alaska has seceded from the nation, the U.S. is a war with Canada, and religious fundamentalists threaten what remains of the American way of life.<br />The sequel is told from three points of view. While much of the conflict is between Lauren and the brother she frees from slavery, Lauren's daughter provides a retrospective and balanced look at the eventual and inevitable hostility between the two siblings. The first half of the book portrays Acorn and its attempts to bloom in a hostile world. When the community comes under attack from the newly elected fundamentalist government that promises to restore law and order, the novel recalls--in a good way--Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" especially in the portrayal of the hypocrisy of those in power and their attitude toward women. Part social commentary, part adventure story, the second half of the novel concerns Lauren's often desperate search for her daughter and her persistent desire to reestablish Earthseed, the religious system she has created which believes that humankind's ultimate destiny is to establish itself on other planets.<br />As usual, Butler is best when depicting intra- and interpersonal conflicts and when detailing the unusual specifics of her imagined world. But, because the novel is such a smorgasbord of themes and because she describes the rise, demise, and resurrection of a community of several dozen people, only the lead characters are meticulously sketched. Unlike her other books, the novel falters occasionally in its attempt to render the many characters, who are often difficult to distinguish.<br />Ultimately, Butler is kind to her readers: she doesn't leave the novel with an wide-open ending designed to generate sequels. But there's good news for those of us who enjoyed the first two books: in an interview at the end of the book she admits that she \\"intends to write about communities of Earthseed who, in fulfillment of the Destiny, go out to extrasolar worlds.\\"cters, who are often difficult to distinguish. <br />Ultimately, Butler is kind to her readers: she doesn't leave the novel with an wide-open ending designed to generate sequels.

Kasson's thesis is twofold: that their popularity was emblematic of the insecurity that white males felt in an increasingly bureaucratic world that threatened racial, sexual, and cultural hegemony and that their semi-mythical qualities were instrumental in changing the collective sense of the ideal man.<br />These stories are undeniably fascinating and informative, and Kasson's thesis is fairly straightfoward. Because Kasson's argument seems easily supported, he is able to focus more on biographical rather than thematic details and includes much information that is not necessary to his argument. As a result, I found myself wishing several times that I were reading instead the three major biographies on which much of his narrative is based: David Chapman's \\"Sandow the Magnificent,\\" Kenneth Silverman's \\"Houdini!!!,\\" and Irwin Porges's \\"Edgar Rice Burroughs.\\"<br />A terrific storyteller, Kasson is likewise unable to avoid including several vignettes that have no direct bearing on his thesis. This is not necessarily a bad thing: his account of female impersonator Julian Eltinge is certainly intriguing, but this section seems peripheral to his discussion. Likewise, he discusses Houdini's obsession with debunking spiritualists, especially Mina (\\"Margery\\") Crandon, but it's never really quite clear what this has to do with societal perceptions of the white male body. Kasson attempts, unconvincingly, to present this as a battle of the sexes, but admits that Houdini directed his ire toward all psychic charlatans, regardless of their sex. Margery just happened to be among the most \\"talented\\" of the spiritualists. When he does finally return to his thesis, the prose turns to semi-parodic academic-speak: \\"In exposing Margery's fraud, Houdini also exposed her as a woman who, despite all her guides and talents, could only sham the phallus.\\"<br />Fortunately, these occasional faults seldom mar the overall presentation. Not only did I enjoy these tales, but Kasson has piqued my interest enough to make me want to read more about these three paragons of \\"masculinity.\\"ry's fraud, Houdini also exposed her as a woman who, despite all her guides and talents, could only sham the phallus.\\"<br />Fortunately, these occasional faults seldom mar the overall presentation.

Some of the more lighthearted tales resemble the best Monty Python skits (and are just as hysterical). In the Seventh Voyage, for example, Tichy gets caught in time loops which causes multiple versions of himself to encounter one another. &quot;That Friday me by now was the Saturday me and perhaps was suddenly knocking about somewhere in the vicinity of Sunday, while this Friday me inside the spacesuit had only recently been the Thursday me, into which same Thursday me I myself had been transformed at midnight.&quot; By the end of the chapter, the spaceship is so crowded with Ijon Tichys that they can barely move around.<br /><br /> Other stories tend more towards historical parody or philosophical commentary. The allusions run so fast and thick that these (particularly the Twentieth and Twenty-First Voyages) pay rereading, and even then I found myself puzzling over some of the references. The themes and plots of these tales most resemble Borges's cabalistic fables (it would be interesting to know if Borges was an influence) and, although they are absorbing in their own right, I don't think Lem's stories are as rewarding as Borges's fiction--but then again, Borges doesn?t demand as much of his reader.<br /><br /> Science fiction aficionados looking for another &quot;Solaris&quot; (or even another &quot;Futurological Congress&quot;) might be disappointed by this volume--but ultimately it will depend on your taste in cerebral humor. Instead of straightforward narrative or easily imagined characters, Lem has fashioned farcical sketches and intellectual brainteasers that are both challenging and humorous.cical sketches and intellectual brainteasers that are both challenging and humorous.	2002-11-17

Anyone who reads this book will come away with enough knowledge about mitochondrial DNA and prehistoric humans to understand today's headlines. Sykes explains how DNA testing identified the bodies of the Romanovs (laying to rest fanciful stories about how they survived the Russian Revolution), he rebuts Thor Heyerdahl's theories of migration, and he presents a convincing case that all humans of European ancestry are descended from seven women. (He also discusses the possible ancestries of non-Europeans, for which--so far--there is far less evidence.)<br />Given how compelling and fun the majority of the book is, nothing prepares the reader for what comes next: seven chapters containing fanciful and completely fictional reconstructions of each of the \\"daughters of Eve.\\" Sykes admits he cannot even be sure of where or when each of these women may have lived, but he reconstructs little soap operas out of the nonexistent facts of their lives; these New Age-inspired outtakes from \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" do not succeed even as good fiction. \\"Xenia was born in the wind and snow of late spring.\\" \\"This year Helena's father was going to try a spear-thrower and detachable point for the first time.\\" \\"Velda had a strong artistic streak.\\" \\"Tara had always been a fast runner and her father, fit though he was, was gaining on her slowly.\\" (Tara even \\"invents\\" a boat.) He fabricates entire families and children, births and deaths, relationships and tragedies for each of these women, even though he knows for certain only that they each had two daughters. For the most part, I found these chapters embarrassing and unreadable.<br />If Sykes wanted to speculate for the reader where, when, and how each of these women lived, he certainly could have done so in a scientific framework and made it interesting. For example, he could have presented what we know from the archaeological record about their approximate eras and possible environs. (I would in particular like to know what evidence, if any, scientists have uncovered to imagine that prehistoric societies featured mostly monogamous relationships, which figure prominently in Sykes`s stories.)<br />Fortunately, Sykes turns his attention back to the science in the last two chapters. Overall, except for the fictional chapters, this is a first-rate survey.

The British director Charles Arrowby has retired to a drafty old house by the sea to write his memoirs. He begins in diary form, relating his daily regime, detailing his fastidiously prepared meals, recalling with fondness (and condescension) people in his life, dismissing others who have crossed him, and reminiscing about the one \\"true love\\" of his life, who inexplicably left him when he was a youth. With the exception of one or two mysterious incidents (at one point, he thinks he sees a dragon in the sea), so little happens in the first 87 pages that anyone will wonder, why am I reading this?<br />It's a set-up. After this lengthy prologue, people from Arrowby's past begin arriving at his doorstep or in the nearby village, shattering the tranquil atmosphere of his retirement and belying the gist of his memories. As the one character who Arrowby had earlier described as \\"very attached to me\\" says in anger: \\"You're an exploded myth.... You never did anything for mankind, you never did a damn thing for anybody but yourself.\\" The reader quickly realizes that Arrowby is an egotistical boor who, under the guise of \\"love,\\" wielded power and fear over the people in his life. Then, as the horde of Londoners from his past continue to invade his new home and complicate his life, he unexpectedly runs into his adolescent flame--and he convinces himself that, trapped in a marriage he regards as repulsive, she still has feelings for him.<br />What follows is both hilarious and heart-rending--and often excruciating to read. Charles Arrowby is not a likeable character; he is, in fact, detestable. And the life he remembers is not how his \\"friends\\" recall it. As his cousin asks him, \\"What is the truth anyway...? As we know ourselves we are fake objects, fakes, bundles of illusions.\\" In the scene previous to this conversation, Arrowby is in a museum, examining Titian's \\"Perseus and Andromeda,\\"  which depicts Perseus rescuing Andromeda from a dragon. Murdoch's novel asks (and here I oversimplify): who's really the monster? who's the rescuer? who indeed needs to be rescued? and at what expense?<br />Be warned: For this Penguin edition Mary Kinzie has provided one of those annoying introductions that would make an excellent afterword.

The stories are valuable and fascinating because they rescue an important legacy from the oblivion of the ill-named \\"Dark Ages.\\" Unfortunately, this rescue mission is hindered by an ill-conceived and even more poorly executed thesis.<br />One of the major problems with Menocal's work is that she never tells us what she means by \\"a culture of tolerance.\\" It is an odd and ambiguous phrase containing two very loaded words. Does \\"culture\\" refer to artistic and intellectual life, or to the religious, political, and social climate, or to the entire civilization and its customs and mores? Does \\"tolerance\\" merely mean mutual influence (in literature and art) or, more broadly, social acceptance (in everyday life)? On the one hand, the phrase \\"culture of tolerance\\" could signify the artistic and intellectual life created by the mixture of three religious heritages. On the other hand, it could mean a climate of economic acceptance and social open-mindedness. Or it could mean something in between: that the fusion of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish traditions resulted from (or perhaps resulted in) a more \\"tolerant\\" society.<br />That the Iberian peninsula experienced an unprecedented tri-cultural fusion during the medieval period is nearly incontrovertible. Al-Andalus (as well as parts of Christian Spain) enjoyed a unique flowering of philosophical, architectural, and literary pursuits underscored by multilingual translation activities. Whether that indicates \\"tolerance\\" is another matter. Menocal is a professor of literature and language; as a result, her book focuses on literary and artistic achievements, but she ignores social, urban, economic, religious, and comparative history to the peril of her thesis. In the epilogue, Menocal herself acknowledges that \\"even when political and ideological circumstances are characterized by strife, artistic and intellectual life prospers\\" (Germany in the 1920s comes to mind). The simple fact that the Christian kings spoke Arabic and read Muslim translations and adapted Moorish architectural motifs does not mean they were \\"tolerant.\\" When confronted with evidence that certain poets and intellectuals were in fact not tolerated (i.e., they were exiled or executed), she still tries to shoehorn their achievements into her nebulous thesis of \\"tolerance.\\"<br />A case could be made that, relatively speaking, medieval Spain did boast a culture or even climate of tolerance, but Menocal's survey is not broad enough to prove this thesis. She acknowledges in her post -September 11 postscript that \\"the forces of intolerance were always present and ultimately triumphed\\" in medieval Spain. Nevertheless, her book highlights the cultural achievements of a few literate, upper-class aesthetes and glosses over pogroms, exiles, persecutions, daily harassment, poll taxes, and slavery--not to mention the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim ghettoes. The result is a worthwhile glimpse of a nearly forgotten intellectual tradition but a lopsided view of medieval Spanish \\"culture.\\"<br />Finally, Menocal's presentation is hardly improved by her prose style. She persistently and unnecessarily uses the passive voice, she strings together barely related modifiers and clauses to create unreadable run-on sentences, she has a tic of using the word \\"But\\" to begin hundreds (no exaggeration) of her sentences, and she is fond of using repeatedly the same cliches and anachronisms (\\"the center did not hold,\\" \\"bestseller,\\" \\"realpolitik\\") and creating new ones (\\"memory palaces\\").

A companion to a PBS series (which I did not see), this \\"oral history\\" of the Internet begins with the Pentagon-funded origins of networking, describes the advent of PCs, and ends with the giddy stock market created by venture capitalists and IPOs.<br />Like the seminal \\"Where Wizards Stay Up Late,\\" this books debunks the myth that the Internet was created by the Pentagon in order to create a communications network that could survive a nuclear war. (Like most legends, this one has a basis in fact: Paul Baran at the Rand Corporation in the early 1960s proposed the theoretical underpinnings for a creation of such a network, but nothing much came of it.) Since this fiction remains so prevalent, it's worth recapping what really happened. In 1968-69, a division of the Pentagon offered grants to a loose consortium of University-based computer centers to develop network protocols--primarily as a method of saving money, since the government was spending a fortune buying mainframe computers for reseach projects at each university. The first nodes of ARPAnet, which became a linchpin for the development of the Internet, were the mainframes at UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah--hardly the center of the military's defense network. Moreover, the protocols, hardware, and software developed for the network were the common property of the academic community and were never \\"top secret.\\"<br />The books also succeeds when recording the voices of the major players in the development of computers, networking, and the Internet: Marc Andreessen, Steve Ballmer, Tim Berners-Lee, Stewart Brand (the ur-tech-hippie), Vint Cerf, Doug Engelbart, and dozens more--they're all here. Regular readers of \\"Dr. Dobbs Journal\\" or even CNet won't find much technical information here they don't already know, but that`s not the point, Instead, Segaller captures the excitement and passion experienced by those in the middle of it all. Nevertheless, readers who are not tech-savvy will gain a basic understanding of how it all came about--and how it all works.<br />Written in 1998, when the capitalization of Web-related businesses was at its most irrational, the book is surprisingly level-headed in its analysis of contemporary trends. Segaller has the foresight to admit that it's too early to tell if many of the newly formed dot.coms would even survive the next five years. (The focus of an entire chapter, Excite--later merged into Excite@Home--is one of the more spectacular flameouts.) The book has some unintentionally comic moments quoting programmers and venture capitalists who were so confident they had recreated the world economy that they seemed to believe they were immune from its cyclical pressures. Yet, regardless of the short-term economic prognosis, there's no doubt that the nerds interviewed for this book are responsible for the dawn of a uniquely transformed era in human communications.'t find much technical information here they don't already know, but that`s not the point, Instead, Segaller captures the excitement and passion experienced by those in the middle of it all.

That would be shame, since the book is far more nuanced than the usual agitprop from the era. While several of the main characters are indeed Communist \\"agitators\\", the book is a multigenerational saga about American labor, racial strife, and ethnic communities. And it's an atypically realistic love story.<br />The plot of \\"The Great Midland\\" frequently recalls Steinbeck's early labor novels; Saxton slyly quotes both the \\"in dubious battle\\" passage from \\"Paradise Lost\\" and \\"grapes of wrath\\" stanza from the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" In Saxton's book, activists (some Communist, some not) struggle to organize Chicago railroad labor against both the callousness of the corporate structure, the hostility of law enforcement, and the unresponsiveness of the union. Unlike most novels at either end of the political spectrum (such as the pro-capitalist manifestos of Ayn Rand or the pro-labor sermonizing of \\"In Dubious Battle\\"), \\"The Great Midland\\" does not offer easy answers, and it does not portray its many heroes, Communist or not, as faultless. Saxton's characters have very human failings, they often bring their own bad luck on themselves, and the path to the utopia they envision is fraught with danger, dashed hopes, and the potential for abuse. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the bosses or the police, whose menace approaches caricature and whose motives or personal lives are never explored.<br />At the center of the tale are Dave Spaas and Stephanie Koviak--married, separated, and reunited as they attempt to balance their individual desires and societal concerns, to resolve the battle between the personal and the political. They have entirely different, often clashing worldviews: while Dave fights to allow people \\"to live better and longer,\\" often to his own neglect, Stephanie believes people should \\"cram into each individual enough living to last for eternity.\\" One of the more memorable characters in the novel, their friend Pledger McAdams, most successfully achieves a balance between these two opposing aims--in spite of the fact that, as a black, he faces daily discrimination. Unfortunately, the wheels of commerce, bigotry, and corruption conspire to rob Pledger of his well-earned status and happiness.<br />In sum, \\"The Great Midland\\" deserves to be read as much for its historical interest and for its realistic portrayal of the human condition as for its political message.ve better and longer,\\" often to his own neglect, Stephanie believes people should \\"cram into each individual enough living to last for eternity.\\" One of the more memorable characters in the novel, their friend Pledger McAdams, most successfully achieves a balance between these two opposing aims--in spite of the fact that, as a black, he faces daily discrimination.

It takes quite a bit of chutzpah for Eugenides's narrator to boast that s/he will become the world's most famous hermaphrodite upon the publication of the book. Astonishingly enough, I think this claim may turn out to be no exaggeration.<br />Eugenides has quite deliberately rewritten the Greek tragedy as a comedy. (Throughout the novel are references, both subtle and overt, to the classics.) In \\"Middlesex,\\" as in Greek drama, fate largely determines one's possibilities and limitations; in this case, genetics brings on Calliope's crisis. But (without giving anything away), Calliope tosses her \\"Greek\\" fate overboard and realizes that \\"a strange new possibility is arising. . . . free will is making a comeback.\\" To say this book is about gender politics, though, would be an unfair oversimplification. In exactly the same way that Calliope undergoes a crisis caused by the ambiguousness of her sex, other characters deal with identity confusion and social strife caused by race, ethnicity, religion, nationalism, and political affiliation. Both humorous and heartbreaking, \\"Middlesex\\" weaves together these sociological themes with both sensitivity and irreverence.<br />The book is nearly flawless in both structure and tone. (One of the books biggest weaknesses is its greatest strength: even after 544 pages, I just didn't want it to end.) Some readers may find the postmodern knowingness or the occasional didacticism a bit much, but I think both are entirely appropriate for the sensitive eccentricity of the narrator and the epic qualities of the story. The book's minor defects are immensely overshadowed by the sheer fun that Eugenides has in telling his story; \\"Middlesex\\" is packed with literary puns, clever one-liners, authorial winks, oddball characters, and hilarious episodes. Rarely does one encounter a work of erudition that is so good-natured and high-spirited.are immensely overshadowed by the sheer fun that Eugenides has in telling his story; \\"Middlesex\\" is packed with literary puns, clever one-liners, authorial winks, oddball characters, and hilarious episodes.

Although it lacks the epic sweep of Russo's novel, \\"Whisper My Names\\" shares a similar setting (small town New England), eccentric and often comical characters, and a narrative informed  by American realist traditions.<br />Hebert perfectly conveys the small-town rivalries, petty grievances, and endearing foibles that afflict the fictional town of Darby, New Hampshire, where two of his previous novels were set. The source of the town's current problems is a proposed shopping mall that (to some) promises new jobs and revenue and (to others) threatens the area's rustic way of life. The novel's characters are motivated by greed, principles, politics, and pretensions--and some of them just don't care. All in all, Darby is a microcosm of American life.<br />At the center of it all is Chance, a journalist covering the story while seeking the identity of his real father and pursuing Soapy, a young girl whose parentage is equally unclear. But the most memorable character is perhaps Ike Jordan, a churlish fraud and petty criminal from the wrong side of the tracks who has pretensions of becoming one of the town's leaders.<br />It's a shame this book is out of print. I can only hope that the University Press of New England, which has reprinted Hebert's first two Darby novels, will see its way to adding this book to its list.	2002-10-06

Both a foreigner and a \\"poofter,\\" James (Iago) Zamora assumes--both actively and passively--the role of outsider and, during the course of his education, has sexual and emotional relationships with two pedophilic teachers. The novel begins (and ends) years later, with an explicit (but entirely unerotic) romp through London's gay underworld and two trysts with a male escort.<br />Rarely in English literature does one encounter a more unlikable protagonist. Even during his school years, it's difficult to sympathize with James, in part because much of the alienation he experiences (particularly in the early years) is self-imposed. He is, in his own words, an \\"insufferable brat,\\" an upper-class, spoiled-rotten snob who detests the philistine behavior of the English schoolboys whose very presence he must endure for eight years. His parents, although wealthy beyond what most of us can imagine, are negligent and self-absorbed, but compared with most of the world's youth (gay or otherwise), the young Zamora enjoys a life of luxury and coddling.<br />What saves the book from unendurable pretentiousness is Golding's language. His prose style recalls most frequently Proust (who gets an honorable mention towards the end), occasionally Woolf, and sometimes even Nicholson Baker--for example, during a particularly dense passage describing the miscellaneous and extensive contents of his childhood nursery or six excruciating pages detailing, from toe to head, how James grooms his (I kid you not) body hair. The narrative is confident and beautiful notwithstanding its hundred-word sentences and florid overstatement.<br />Yet, in spite of his masterful and encyclopedic use of language and (moreover) in spite of all that his hero tolerates as an adolescent, Golding's novel is remarkably dispassionate. The hustler hired by Zamora, after enduring his semi-vitriolic abuse, says that James \\"thinks too much.\\" True enough, but--more accurately--James doesn't seem to feel much of anything. His emotional detachment works for and against the book: Zamora comes across as a cold-hearted, emotionally stilted adult, but his childhood traumas are minimized by his aloofness.<br />An article in the British press by Peter Conrad dismissed \\"The Abomination\\" as little more than self-love, a literary act of onanism. But I think this criticism is unfair: Golding isn't in love with his self as much as he is in love (rightly) with the sound of his own voice. How a reader will respond to this book depends entirely on whether you think the author's eloquence is enough to make up for the novel's shortcomings. Judging purely on style and linguistic ability, I think Golding's debut is an extraordinary (upper-cased) Achievement.

Like his realist predecessors, Russo masterfully renders several disparate perspectives, he flawlessly records cafe conversation and barroom banter, and he expertly creates characters who are both familiar and convincing. In addition, he so successfully distracts the reader with red-herring \\"secrets\\" (for example, Charlie Mayne, whose identity you are meant to figure out right away) that you won't expect the approaching, inevitable crescendo that provides the book's climax.<br />But the greatest strength of \\"Empire Falls\\" is not its plot--mesmerizing as it is--but its characters. The disillusioned and unmotivated Miles Roby serves as the center of the local goings-on and, to some extent, the town's limited social life. His adolescent daughter Tick provides Miles with his only source of hope; it's been a long time since I've read a novel that so effortlessly captures the high school experience. And I will never forget some of Empire Falls's more colorful residents: Max Roby (Miles's father), a slovenly \\"public nuisance\\" and scam artist; the town's matriarch Francine Whiting, whose intelligence and humor defy her caricature as the local witch; Walt Comeau, an annoying, aging bodybuilder who runs the area's gym; Father Tom, a senile priest who calls his longtime parishioners \\"peckerheads.\\"  They all are recognizable types, but Russo infuses each of them with lives of their own.<br />Satirical without being condescending, warm without being sentimental, authentic without being predictable \\"Empire Falls\\" captures perfectly small-town life in the modern world.ng sentimental, authentic without being predictable \\"Empire Falls\\" captures perfectly small-town life in the modern world.	2002-09-21

What gives her debut special resonance is that it is a wholly undisguised portrait of her family--not even the names of her siblings have been changed--and she incorporates much of the black folklore, Caribbean mysticism, and African spirituality she encountered in her scholarly research.<br />Hurston enviably manages to present her father and her long-suffering mother with all their strengths and weaknesses; her account is unsparingly brutal, yearningly affectionate, and remarkably nonjudgmental. (Her portrayal of her wicked, hoodoo-leaning stepmother is less even-handed; here Hurston takes the opportunity for revenge.) A sign of her achievement is that it is hard to tell where fact ends and fiction begins (for example, Hurston's father died in 1917, but John Pearson's story continues through the 1920s).<br />Even though the story never lags, I found the representation of black Southern dialect hard-going for the first few chapters. After a while, though, you get used to the cadences and colloquialisms, and the reader's diligence is repaid tenfold. &quot;Jonah's Gourd Vine&quot; is one of those surprising discoveries you wished more people had read.	2002-09-15

Hornby has posited an interesting premise: what if you got what you wished for--in this case, what if your angry, curmudgeonly spouse met a dubious messiah and suddenly and miraculously became (morally) \\"good\\"? How would your life be affected? How would you react? Would it really be what you wished for; would it really be all that \\"good\\"?<br />In spite of its subject matter, however, \\"How to Be Good\\" is not a work of psychological fiction. Short of a severe trauma (or a trip to Damascus), humans don't undergo complete character transformations overnight. Asking what the world would be like if we could alter our personalities without provocation is like asking what would happen if, tomorrow, we could suddenly be invisible. In effect, like H. G. Wells, Hornby has written a social commentary disguised as a fantasy novel, a fable of modern suburbia.<br />But Hornby commits the cardinal sin of satirical writing: the rest of the novel--after the first 25 pages or so--is only occasionally humorous, and most of the humor derives from situational absurdity rather than wit or substance. Presented from the wife's point of view, the narrative lacks cleverness or even drollness, and it quickly degenerates into whining protest (the statement \\"I`m a good person, I'm a doctor . . .\\" is repeated in various forms at least fifty times) and monotonous self-analysis (\\"It could well be that I am going mad; or, on the other hand, that I am simply confused and unhappy; or, on the third hand, that I know exactly what I want but cannot bring myself to do it because of all the pain it would cause . . .\\"). Hornby seems to have a rather uncharitable view of how women think; his caricature borders on misogyny--although, admittedly, the men in this book do not fare much better.<br />Hornby seems to want very badly to write a novel with a Message. \\"How to Be Good,\\" unfortunately, is as profound as Richard Bach's \\"Illusions\\" and its reluctant messiah--and just about as subtle in its Hallmark piousness. He scatters ill-conceived sermons at various random targets--liberalism, popular culture, intellectualism--and even though the sanctimonious tone is frequently unbearable, it's rarely quite clear what he is trying to say.

The best elements of his preceding work are here--Native American mysticism, elegant prose, bawdy humor--along with a seething anger reminiscent of David B. Feinberg and the neurotic cosmopolitanism of Spalding Gray.<br />The basic story combines two narratives that have been told many times before: rural boy comes to New York and confronts the fact that he is gay; a group of friends live through the early years of the AIDS epidemic. There are some wonderful moments when the Idaho-bred naivety of the lead character, William Parker, meets New York's in-your-face honesty. In particular, the chapter describing his first day on the job in a restaurant is relentlessly hilarious. (A personal note: I moved to New York from the Northwest the same month and year as Parker did. Manhattan was certainly a different place then, and Spanbauer captures perfectly the city's grittiness.)<br />Living in New York during the 1980s was at times certainly like living in a war zone, especially for those of us who lost (and are still losing) so many friends to AIDS. While Spanbauer's portrait of New York City is brutally on-target, his plot and characters never seem quite right. Like David Feinberg, Spanbauer can't contain his anger; his book boils in its hostility toward the Reagans, the Church, gentrification, and other all-too-easy targets, and he overstates his tirades to the point of absurdity. (A vengeful crime directed at \\"Cardinal O'Henry\\" on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral is exceptionally silly.) And, like Spalding Gray, Spanbauer seems more interested in breaking taboos than in exploring their impact on his characters or tying them into his plot. For example, an uncomfortably explicit account of incest does not in any way contribute to the development of the novel's character or story; it reads like an appended scene hoping to equal the shock value of his previous novel. He is often so busy brewing these episodes that he ultimately fails to make his characters and their actions coherent or convincing; without exception, everybody in the novel either goes crazy or dies. Five hundred pages later, the number of loose ends and pointless incidents defy counting.<br />Spanbauer is undoubtedly one of the best stylists writing \\"gay fiction\\" today.

A unique blend of oceanography, philosophy, and social commentary, the book often succeeds and sometimes falters.<br />Much of the \\"log\\" alternates between lists of the specimens gathered by the seafarers and reflections stimulated by the species (including the humans) encountered on the trip. The descriptions of sea life are occasionally fascinating, such as Steinbeck's delightful portrayal of the wily Sally Lightfoot crabs: \\"They seem to be able to run in any one of four directions; but more than this, perhaps because of their rapid reaction time, they appear to read the mind of their hunter.... [Man`s] tendency eventually is to scream curses, to hurl himself at them, and to come up foaming with rage and bruised all over his chest.\\" But for every passage like this one, there are a dozen sentences that have all the interest of a catalog entry (\\"Rock oysters there were, and oysters; limpets and sponges; corals of two types; peanut worms; sea-cucumbers; and many crabs....).<br />Steinbeck's philosophical and political meditations are far more compelling, especially when he offers his views on social Darwinism, contemporary affairs, or local history. He enters murky waters, however, when he delves into abstract philosophical matters (for example, his often impenetrable deliberations on the differences between teleological and non-teleological thinking).<br />Curiously enough, the most fully illustrated \\"characters\\" in this book are the offshore collecting pools, onshore natives, and--most memorably--the \\"Sea Cow,\\" an insolent outboard motor with which the crew struggles throughout the voyage.

US	41905526	R2HS33LO3WJ577	0395709857	386538954	The Missing Moment: How the Unconscious Shapes Modern Science	Books	3	9	12	N	N	On-target entreaty tainted by Freudian psychobabble	Pollack's fascinatingly presented--and infuriatingly argued--book makes two contentions: that medical science spends most of its efforts on defying the inevitability of death (rather than preventing disease and alleviating suffering), and that the reason for this lopsided strategy is a collective unconscious fear of death by most health professionals. \\"The Missing Moment\\" of the title refers both metaphorically to the gap between knowledge and wisdom and literally to the half second during which unconscious machinations affect and transform the thoughts and actions of everyone--including scientists.<br />Pollack's first argument is expertly and cogently presented in, strangely enough, the second half of the book. The author discusses infectious diseases, cancer, and aging; he convincingly (and rightly) shows that the medical establishment has come to rely too heavily on antibiotics to cure infection (rather than vaccines to achieve deterrence), risky and painful procedures to treat cancer (rather than behavioral and environmental changes to prevent it), and attempts to delay death (rather than efforts to improve the quality of one's remaining life).  The informative notes are not to be skipped, and a must-read appendix outlines Pollack's views for a more humane medical agenda.<br />In the first half of the book, however, Pollack dilutes the force of his appeal by waving a Freudian wand and suggesting that health professionals are blinded by a collective unconscious desire: their own fear of death. Although Pollack discusses some fascinating aspects of how the mind works and how it affects human behavior, he is not a psychotherapist and--more to the point--he did not examine the scientists he is analyzing in anything resembling a clinical setting (other than, I gather, to read their publications and mingle with them at conferences).<br />Completing lacking from his analysis is either proof that the research conducted by most scientists is motivated primarily by an unconscious fear of death (rather than any of a dozen other intentions) or--more important--a causal connection between that fear and their research. There are dozens of possible, obvious reasons the medical establishment pursues its death-defying agenda--and Pollack simply ignores all of them. For example, a cynic would cite the profit motive: after all, the amount of money made on preventing or curing smallpox last year was exactly $0.00, while trillions were made by corporations on medicines that treat or cure (rather than prevent or eradicate) most other diseases. Or, alternatively, an idealist might point out that devoting the resources of the last two decades to finding an AIDS vaccine would barbarically have required doctors to abandon the hundreds of thousands of people whose immune systems were already compromised. As Pollack himself points out in his appendix, \\"the purpose of medicine [is] to alleviate or cure the suffering of a person already here among us\\"--by concentrating first on the development of protease inhibitors and other treatments, isn`t that exactly what scientists did (however myopic it might seem to us now)?<br />What's baffling about Pollack's attempt at collective psychotherapy is that it is not essential to his basic agenda--changing the priorities of the world's health systems. The net effect is that his intriguing and humane entreaty is undermined by the alienation most of his colleagues must experience when reading his blanket condemnation of their motives.unconscious fear of death (rather than any of a dozen other intentions) or--more important--a causal connection between that fear and their research.

The tensions in the building escalate when a young Hindu woman elopes with a neighboring Muslim son. To describe the plot of the novel any further is to risk making it sound like the Indian version of \\"Melrose Place\\"; the plot is much more carefully nuanced and the protagonists are too fully realized for this novel to resemble a mere soap opera.<br />Suri weaves together several strands of Indian society: religious themes, Bollywood influences (although the characters don`t break out in song), social pretensions, Hindu-Muslim hostilities. Although he often mocks his characters' aspirations and delusions, his portrayals are more loving than derisive. And don't let the Hindu allusions that abound in the book scare you away from the joy of reading it; most readers should find the religious elements both accessible and entertaining.<br />Although the novel is beautifully written, I often found his choice of when to use non-English terms perplexing. I can understand why the author would use words that are not readily translatable: \\"dharma\\" (sacred duty), \\"sadhu\\" (Hindu holy man), ghungroo (a bell-adorned anklet). But why \\"bandar\\" (monkey), or pista (\\"pistachio\\"), \\"masjid\\" (mosque), or \\"tamasha\\" (spectacle)? Or, more to the point, why make non-Indian readers flip back to the glossary for words such as these but not similar words that are rendered simply in English (dog, walnut, temple, mob)? This is a minor complaint, however; after a while, the reader is able to figure out the meaning of many words from their context, and I ended up ignoring the glossary for most of the last half of this enchanting book.f this enchanting book.	2002-08-04

That is the book's strength: Drake has quite an imagination, and he kept me guessing throughout.<br />Although I found the main characters likable, the heroes are, sadly, from the same mold you find in too many fantasy adventures these days--well-honed bodies, invincible powers, preordained destinies--and they are notable for a lack of introspection (except in their ability to compare the outside world constantly to the way things were back in their rural village). Even worse is the sprite Mellie, Drake's attempt at creating a cute little Disney-style sidekick a la Thumper or Flounder; instead he conjures an annoying creature that is as appealing as Jar Jar. (A very typical line: \\" 'You're so strong, Cashel!' Mellie cooed as she cuddled his ear.\\") Drake is much better when developing the characters of misguided protagonists (like the jealous Ilna) and irredeemable wrongdoers--particularly the magician Meder, whose heinousness completely stunned even a jaded fantasy reader like me.<br />Drake's writing style throughout the book never rises above utilitarian. He excels at describing the adventures of his characters in a journalistic tone that is always clear and usually concise, carrying the reader along in page-turning anticipation from one episode to the next. What his prose boasts in clarity, however, it lacks in lyricism and wit. There is nary a well-turned phrase, and the lack of comic moments is remarkable for a writer with such an incredible imagination. If Drake were able to inject more humor into his prose and add depth to his heroes, he could produce a fantasy masterpiece.	2002-07-25

The remainder of the book--a series of case studies--is somewhat ill-assorted, in large part because the chapters are, for the most part, revised versions of previously published articles and little attempt was made to weave everything into a coherent unit.<br />Readers looking for detail on any particular subject should look elsewhere. There are, of course, far better books debunking Holocaust denial, creationism, IQ measurement, UFOs, etc. (One odd error by Shermer: his chapter on \\"medieval witch crazes\\" actually discusses the epidemics that swept Shakespearean England and colonial America--long after anyone's definition of the medieval period.) Nevertheless, as an overview, however, this volume succeeds nicely.<br />The weakest chapter, it must be said, is the one attacking Frank Tipler and his eschatological philosophy-physics. Much of Tipler's over-the-top nonsense is certainly deserving of refutation, but Shermer spends several pages inexplicably discussing the fact that Tipler was an oldest child and presenting the assertion that the eldest sibling is more likely to hold conservative views. This presentation certainly doesn't refute Tipler's theories, and it fails even as a scientifically-based psychological underpinning. The study cited by Shermer compared variables that were randomly selected (for example: age, sex, and nationality--but not ethnicity, eye color, height, weight, diet, and wellness) and, in many cases, subjectively measured (socioeconomic status, religious and political attitudes, conflict with parents..., travel, education). The study concluded that birth order was the strongest factor in \\"receptivity\\" to \\"innovation in science\\" (which itself must be subjectively defined). Furthermore, to fit Tipler into this preordained mold, Shermer simply waves a wand and asserts that Tipler's beliefs are ultra-conservative. As Shermer points out elsewhere in this book, subjective measurements and subjective definitions do not lead to objective conclusions, and what may be true of a nebulously defined group will not necessarily be true of an individual, so it's a bit perplexing that he himself falls into these traps.<br />Finally, the reader should be warned that the paperback edition is one of the most atrociously typeset books I've ever purchased. (I have the first printing, so later printings might be in better shape.) The prologue ends mid-sentence, entries (e.g., between Polkinghorne and Rand) are omitted from the bibliography, and parts of paragraphs are missing from the text, leaving the reader guessing what was supposed to be there.us, religious and political attitudes, conflict with parents..., travel, education).

Ackerley's colleague E. M. Forster hailed the book; Edith Sitwell declared it \\"filth.\\" The most balanced and reasonable reading may have been from the novelist Julia Strachey, who noted in a private letter, \\"though entirely about dogs, [it] is a veritable little marvel of brilliance and shockingness. I don't know when I read anything so indecent, disgusting, touching, beautiful, and stylish.\\" In spite of the critical attention, however, the book sold abysmally: two years later, half the first printing was still in storage, and no American publisher would touch it for nearly a decade. (Most of these details are culled from Peter Parker's excellent biography of Ackerley.)<br /><br />Although many people consider it a classic (and I too found it moving and extraordinarily witty), \\"Tulip\\" has only recently found an audience. The reticence and revulsion that even today greets this little book is usually in three forms. First, Ackerley wrote neither a cute book for dog lovers nor a user's manual; most of the book describes the sex life (real and frustrated) and excretory functions of his dog (whose real name was Queenie). Like Ackerley's other books, this one is intended to shock and occasionally disgust, and Ackerley seems positively obsessed with Tulip`s libidinous needs and toiletry habits--so much so that his British publisher submitted it for legal review before printing it. Second, many of today's animal lovers are upset by a scene in which Ackerley considers killing some of Tulip's offspring. Never mind that he ultimately doesn't have the heart to do it: this practice was all too common fifty years ago, when neutering was not widely available. And, third--and perhaps most seriously--Ackerley certainly comes across as a curmudgeon (if not a downright creep), and his scorn of the \\"working classes\\" is harsh on egalitarian ears.<br /><br />But this book ultimately won me over. From the descriptions of Tulip's inopportune venues for defecation to Ackerley's hysterical attempts to find the proper mate for his beloved Alsatian, the humor, warmth, and playfulness of \\"My Dog Tulip\\" should appeal to most readers and especially to dog owners..

Think &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; meets Iris Murdoch's &quot;The Bell&quot; (another psychological drama set in the British countryside and told from three contrasting points of view), with a twist of John Fowles's &quot;French Lieutenant's Woman&quot; at the end.<br />Because the first half of the book (about how a young girl's misperceptions and wrong-headedness ruins the lives of those she loves) is so different from the second half (about the war experiences of two of the novel's characters), some readers may feel that they are reading two radically different novels. I didn't find the dichotomy bothersome, however. Wars don't exist in a vacuum, and neither do family dramas. Instead, the tensions between the two sections graphically contrast the harsh realities of the war with the ambling, if disturbing, portrayal of familial strife. Everything ties together in the end, and the novel succeeds, I think, both as two disparate stories and as the sum of its parts.<br />McEwan is a masterful writer, but he does have an occasionally vexing tendency to get carried away with his metaphors. His account of a migraine, to cite just one example, reads, in part: &quot;Once this lazy creature moved from the peripheries to the center, then the knifing pains would obliterate all thought.... It bore her no malice, this animal, it was indifferent to her misery. It would move as a caged panther might: because it was awake, out of boredom, for the sake of movement itself, or for no reason at all, and with no awareness.&quot; I half-expected him to describe the wildcat's quivering whiskers.<br />Much attention has been paid to the \\"surprising\\" plot twists, but as the epigraph from Austen implies, McEwan is writing a character novel (as well as a book about the art of writing); he is not a mystery writer. The &quot;whodunit&quot; aspect (which I won't give away) is effectively exposed midway through the first part, and many--if not most--attentive readers will expect the revelations in the novel's epilogue by the time they finish chapter 3, in which the young girl speculates how she can use an incident she witnessed as the basis for a novel told from the perspective of three characters.<br />No novel can live up to the kind of hype this book has generated, and certainly no work of fiction will satisfy the tastes of all readers. I do think, however, that &quot;Atonement&quot; will be immensely satisfying to many readers of literary novels (and the emphasis here is on the word &quot;literary&quot;) if they ignore most of the accolades and approach the book &quot;con tabula rasa.&quot;of writing); he is not a mystery writer.

The first third of the book, when Chiyo (who eventually becomes the geisha Sayuri) and her sister are sold into childhood slavery, was especially disturbing and powerful, and the historical and cultural details throughout are fascinating, although I found my interest flagging occasionally as the novel proceeded toward its somewhat predictable conclusion. Sure, the book is another Dickensian Cinderella story (it's also like Claire Booth Luce`s \\"The Women\\" at times!), but its creative chutzpah, competent prose, and epic qualities ultimately won me over.<br />The book's naysayers (few as they are) often level two accusations. The first charge is that the story misrepresents geisha. The detractors often cite as evidence the lawsuit against the author by Mineko Iwasaki, a \\"retired\\" geisha whom Golden interviewed while researching his book. Of particular embarrassment to Mineko, for example, is the sale of Sayuri's adolescent virginity to the highest bidder--a practice that has all but disappeared in Japan over the years. In Golden's defense, however, the novel is set in the 1930s and '40s--well before Mineko was even born. Although he may have incorporated some of Mineko's experiences, Sayuri is clearly Golden's own creation. Ironically, Mineko's lawyer herself acknowledged at a press conference that the book succeeds, at least partially, in its attempt to represent a geisha's point of view. (''All the buzz about 'How could a man get so inside a woman's head?' Well, the answer is, it's her [Mineko's] story.'')<br />A number of readers also denounce the book because a white man has dared to write from the point of view of a Japanese woman, or that the book is \\"Westernized\\" and therefore illegitimate. I do think this is a valid criticism: it irritates me, for example, that Golden gives Sayuri blue-gray eyes, as if this all-too-Western feature is needed to make her truly beautiful. (Why not cinnamon eyes, for heaven's sake?) In addition, the book's dialogue is peppered with Americanisms (\\"Hey,\\" \\"Really,\\" \\"Heavens, no!\\"); according to an Salon article, the translator of the book into Japanese had to rewrite much of the prose to make it seem more authentic.<br />Yet Golden himself seems to realize he must view this culture through a Western prism, so, with a wink to his reader, he \\"Westernizes\\" his character and adds an American intermediary. At the time she tells her story, Sayuri has lived over thirty years in New York (almost twice as long as she spent in the Gion district of Kyoto), so that she and her memories are assimilated to some degree, and she dictates her story to an American translator, who then transcribes her memoirs for an American audience.<br />Overall, then, the fact that Golden has written a novel (as another reader put it) \\"from the vantage of a person who is completely removed from himself in time, space, culture, and gender\\" is not enough on its own to condemn it; numerous authors--from both East and West, from Shakespeare to Nabokov--have succeeded doing exactly that.

Gregor Samsa is the mistaken-for-dead human-turned-insect who made his debut in Franz Kakfa's \\"Metamorphosis.\\" In this \\"sequel,\\" Samsa is rescued by a freak show in Austria, where he teaches philosophy and physics to the masses and eventually meets Musil and Wittgenstein. He emigrates to America and becomes an exhibit at the Scopes Trial and a key player in the Roosevelt administration. Any plot summary (including mine) will necessarily make the book sound positively silly, but Estrin somehow pulls it off--again and again. As a New York Times reviewer noted in an enthusiastic essay, it's \\"Ragtime for roaches,\\" but accurate as this phrase is, it disguises the fact that \\"Insect Dreams\\" is one of the most intelligent, witty, and fascinating novels ever written, with passages that should both delight and haunt any reader.<br /><br />The most enviable aspect of Estrin's debut--and it's hard to believe that this is his first novel--is that it manages to frame an extraordinarily satisfying intellectual feast with a page-turning plot that is both hilarious and moving. Encapsulating what was arguably the worst thirty years in human history, yet featuring some of the most brilliant minds ever produced by civilization, this literary masterpiece will appeal to both brainiacs and beach-readers.	2002-06-23

The first third of the book reads almost like an adventure story: Ijon Tichy is attending a convention of futurologists in Central America, when he and his colleagues are caught up in a bizarre coup d`etat. When Tichy's cryogenically frozen corpse is reanimated decades later, the entire overpopulated world is hooked on drugs.<br />Unlike most pieces of dystopian fiction, Lem's novel is funny and brainy rather than depressing and catastrophic, but it is still scarily prophetic. At times, though, the prose threatens to collapse into a pun-laden Physician's Desk Reference for the Year 2039: \\"they give the children throttlepops, then develop their character with opinionates, uncompromil, rebellium, allaying their passions with sordidan and practicol; no police, and who needs them when you have constabuline. . . ?\\" (These passages must have been a nightmare to translate and, remarkably, they never lose their fluency.) But Lem keeps the reader's interest by alternating his pharmocological laundry lists with clever plot twists and bizarre visions, and the novel's pace continuously accelerates until its frenzied, over-the-top climax.	2002-06-23

H. Morgan, and especially William Bateson) who, two decades after his death, quarreled over the applicability of his now-famous findings. Readers looking for an introduction to the science itself will be disappointed, however, since the book offers only a cursory introduction.<br />The biography is lean, because very little is known about Mendel himself. The author resorts to imagining probable scenes from his life: \\"In a corner of the monastery garden, Mendel huddled myopically over rows of greening plants.\\" \\"His curly brown hair thinning around his widening face, Mendel sat at the oak writing table in the orangery, where the air was warm and lushly fragrant.\\" You either enjoy this sort of thing, or you don't--but I can report that at least Henig does not invent dialogue.<br />By far the more interesting part of the book is the second half, which conveys the quarrels and intrigues by which Mendel and his publications were rediscovered and illuminated by a gaggle of ego-driven scientists bent on proving each other wrong. It's fun reading, if a little disheartening, but it's nice to know that the dead man wins. Overall, \\"The Monk in the Garden\\" is a decent historical introduction to the founding of genetics, but not much more.	2002-06-16

I was particularly impressed by how several of the chapters elucidated and expanded upon concepts presented in earlier chapters. It would have been helpful, however, if Gribbin had indicated when each of these chapters was originally written (a few originated in the late 1970s), since some of the ideas presented seem to have been eclipsed or supplemented by more recent advances.<br />Some readers with a more thorough scientific background may find the information here a little too general, but I wish I had read this book before I had tackled more complex volumes--they wouldn't have been such hard going!	2002-06-15

Like Joe Klein, Adams published his book anonymously and skewered a number of contemporary politicians (including President Rutherford B. Hayes). But Adams goes two steps further: his novel is a scathing commentary more on the American political system in general than on one administration in particular, and his characters are iconic and recognizable in any era.<br />In \\"Democracy,\\" the nation's capital \\"swarms with simple-minded exhibitions of human nature; men and women curiously out of place, whom it would be cruel to ridicule and ridiculous to weep over.\\" But Adams is not hesitant about being cruel in his portrayal of Washington's residents, and he saves his weeping for the true victims in his novel: the American people. The typical American senator combines \\"the utmost pragmatical self-assurance  and overbearing temper with the narrowest education and meanest personal experience that ever existed in any considerable government.\\" (Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose!)<br />The story concerns Madeleine Lee, an intelligent and well-meaning (if somewhat naive) New York widow, who, bored with her cosmopolitan lifestyle, travels to Washington to learn what makes the nation tick. She and her sister are quickly surrounded by a diverse group of politicians, lobbyists, and foreign diplomats, and she finds herself courted by Silas Ratcliffe, a senator with presidential aspirations whose talent \\"consisted in the skill with which he evaded questions of principle.\\" During one heated (and humorous) argument about George Washington's merits, Ratcliffe sums up his view of politics: \\"If virtue won't answer our purpose, then we must use vice, or our opponents will put us out of office.\\"<br />Adams's prose is almost Jamesian in its measured pacing (and this may simply bore some readers); the initial chapters are unhurried as he weaves the web of the plot and sketches his all-too-believable characters.

Upon his arrival in the United States, the boy discovers the films of Montgomery Clift, whose movie persona provides much-needed emotional support that gradually becomes a psychological crutch.<br />Briskly told, the novel reads more like a play in parts. Many of the characters (especially Bob's foster parents and their daughter Amada) are aptly drawn, the descriptions of torture under the Marcos regime are harrowing, and the device of using Bob/Bong`s letters to Montgomery Clift as chapter openings is artfully executed. Alumit is also adept at depicting the interplay between the various members of the foster family and the breakdown of their relations when Bob discovers a secret about Amada`s parents.<br />I agree with others who've said that this is a promising first novel, but that statement alone sometimes damns a book with faint praise. The prose isn't just minimal; it's often skeletal, told with abbreviated sentences and fragments. In a mature hand, this barebones style might be effective for a purely psychological novel, but this novel aspires to be more than that. For example, Alumit fails to convey the culture shock that would have greeted a boy arriving in California from the Philippines or a young man returning to his homeland almost twenty years later. The scenes abroad could have taken place in just about any country; only the references to the Marcos regime are specific to the Philippines. Likewise, the only passages unique to life in Los Angeles is a scene at Grauman's Chinese Theater and an unnecessarily detailed paragraph describing a couple of rides at Disneyland.<br />The biggest disappointment, however, is the last section, which relies on a series of improbable coincidences that rapidly give way to melodrama and sentimentality. I won't give anything away except to say that this novel, in spite of its title, deserved more than a Hollywood ending.entimentality.

Ramsey's lifelong guilt about surviving the trip is amplified by the fact that he slept with Belle Leeming, the wife of the leader of the expedition; his memories are haunted by the details of Stephen Leeming's death; and his equilibrium is unsettled by the news that Leeming's body has been discovered in the glacial ice. Although Ramsey acts like a man with a dark secret, it's unclear how much of his recollection is a result of post-traumatic stress and how much really happened.<br />Nearing the end of his life, Ramsey is haunted by his past and afraid of having his memories challenged; he fears \\"a change in the essence of his life, a change as absolute as death.\\" He has lived with his nightmares for so long that he doesn't want them minimized or publicized by the grotesque charade that will inevitably result when the body is exhumed. Nevertheless, by the end of the book, as Leeming's experience is subjected to increased scrutiny, the reader (as one of the minor characters puts it) is not quite sure \\"what it was all about.\\"<br />But Leeming's plight is only half the story; the other half is an extremely witty parade of academic caricatures (auguring the works of David Lodge) that lightens the seriousness of Ramsey's burden. Combined with Ramsey's self-mocking reflections, the tone of the book is both poignant and cynical without ever being depressing.<br />Given the success of Keneally's \\"Schindler's Ark\\" (the basis for \\"Schindler's List\\"), as well as his numerous literary awards, it's baffling and sad that this thought-provoking and pleasing book is out of print.	2002-05-26
US	41905526	RSNE9E2GZA2OI	0684870045	872816049	Quest for the Quantum Computer	Books	2	19	20	N	N	Important topic marred by dull presentation	I read \\"Minds, Machines, and the Multiverse\\" (reprinted in paperback as \\"The Quest for the Quantum Computer\\") alongside David Deutsch's \\"The Fabric of Reality,\\" thinking that Julian Brown's journalism would help elucidate Deutsch's text, which I assumed would be more difficult. Ironically, not only did I find \\"The Fabric of Reality\\" far more exciting and readable, but, even on its own terms, Brown's book was often monotonous and unimaginative.<br />While the first and last chapters are quite fascinating, the meat of the book reads like an endless serious of abstracts of articles excerpted from mathematical, physics, and computing journals, separated by droll subheads (\\"Beam Me Up, Atom by Atom\\"). The major problem is that Brown doesn't seem to have any particular audience in mind. On the one hand, it's hard to imagine most lay readers sitting through his detailed expositions on various mathematics and physics concepts; on the other, math-savvy readers don't need to be told (to cite just one example) what ASCII is.<br />It's not just that Brown's book is knee-deep in mathematics, however. In fact, the math presented is really not that difficult--it's just boringly presented. The endless series of Alice, Bob, Carol, and Eve stories has all the verve of the litany of questions on the SAT. (Several times I found myself asking, \\"Which Bob is this?\\"). Likewise, the descriptions of logic gates are about as exciting as my college textbooks on linear algebra and number theory. Brown's presentation is hampered further by the lack of a glossary; he repeatedly expects the reader to remember terms he discussed over 100 pages earlier.<br />In sum, computer programmers and armchair mathematicians looking for a primer on the theoretical underpinnings of quantum computation might find this book a helpful introduction. The general reader, however, will have to wait for a well-written overview of the subject. In the meantime, I recommend \\"The Fabric of Reality\\" as a starting point.	2002-05-26
US	41905526	R1A2K7FTSHBADW	006019779X	678654869	You Know Better: A Novel	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Family drama that's both perceptive and preachy	This is the first novel by Tina McElroy Ansa that I've read and, I suspect--judging from the reviews in the press--that it's not by any means her best. It's hard to compare \\"You Know Better\\" to anything else I've read: its technique and style are original (and occasionally brilliant), but the substance of the novel is a bit shallow and, in the end, excessively preachy. The book was good enough, however, to make me want to read another of Ansa's novels.<br />\\"You Know Better\\" relates a day in the life of Lily Paine Pines, her daughter Sandra, and her granddaughter LaShawndra--three women in the Georgia town of Mulberry whose lives are thrown into disarray after LaShawndra commits an unspecified crime. (Ansa tries to lend an aura of mystery and suspense as to the nature of the crime, but the secret, when it is revealed, is a bit of a let-down.) Each woman is visited by a different \\"ghost of Mulberry past\\"--three recently departed denizens who resemble the women who are still living and who want to help this troubled family experience the successes and avoid the mistakes they made during their own lives. None of the Pines women realize, however, that their traveling companions are dead.<br />I nearly gave up on this book after the first 80 pages (although I'm glad I didn't). The author divides the novel into three nearly equal parts, with each woman narrating one section. Although Ansa is extraordinarily adept at distinguishing between the three voices (from the patient schoolmarmish tone of the elder Pines woman to the hip-hop banter of the granddaughter), the grandmother tends to speak in annoying cliches (\\"third time's the charm,\\" \\"bless her little heart,\\" \\"pretty as a picture,\\" \\"not a pretty picture\\") and groan-worthy truisms that never deserved to see the light of print ... Yes, it's the way my Texan grandmother speaks as well, but reading 100 pages of it is a bit painful.<br />The novel gets much better, though. One of the book's accomplishments is the author's ability to keep things interesting even though everything takes place in cars, as the three women are driving around Georgia talking to their ghost companions and reflecting on their family problems. Naturally, the three still-living women make much of the differences between them, but Ansa delights in making obvious how similar they are. And it's that similarity that, in the end, brings them to their salvation.ability to keep things interesting even though everything takes place in cars, as the three women are driving around Georgia talking to their ghost companions and reflecting on their family problems.

US	41905526	R2X2E8VTLG77C7	0140186409	999720718	The Grapes of Wrath (20th Century Classics)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A harrowing chronicle of poverty and helplessness	Between 1936 and 1938, Steinbeck wrote a series of newspaper articles for the San Francisco News and the Monterey Trader about the horrendous plight of the migrant workers in California, many of whom arrived from Oklahoma, Texas, and beyond, seeking work during the \\"Dust Bowl migration\\" of the 1930s. (Earlier, he had written and published a novel \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" about labor unrest among those same migrant workers.) The fruit of Steinbeck`s years mingling with these workers and investigating their conditions, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful and sympathetic fictional portrayal of one family's horrific odyssey across America in search of work after losing ownership of their farm.<br />There is certainly more than one way to read this novel: as an incendiary historical document that galvanized the country (Eleanor Roosevelt and various politicians took up the cause of the migrant workers, while conservative-leaning groups and towns banned--or burned--the book); as an epic about human perseverance, survival, and dignity (reflected symbolically in the much-maligned \\"turtle chapter\\"); as a political manifesto unflinching in its condemnation of the insensitivities of corporate capitalism (for which Steinbeck was accused of Communist sympathies). Readers who find the novel unrelentingly depressing or unrealistic in its portrayal of the Joad family's fate should understand that the Joads were actually quite lucky. (Very few migrant families, for example, were fortunate enough to live in government camps.)<br />The first hundred pages or so proceed rather slowly, in part because Steinbeck alternates the chapters about the Joad family with prosaic interludes describing the difficulties facing the migrant workers in general. But the pace of the novel accelerates (and the interludes become shorter), as various members of the Joad family experience frustration, sickness, brief periods of success, and death--never letting go of their dream of settling down somewhere and living in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable. (The two children are, well, just like children). The ending, which must have been scandalously shocking in the 1930s, is still electrifying; it forcefully shows the desperate lengths the poor were willing to go to help each other when most of America didn't care about their plight.<br />This is my second time reading the novel, and--although I again found it gripping and moving--I was not as impressed as the first time I read it two decades ago. (I was much more idealistic then, I suppose.) One of the novel's greatest weaknesses is that Steinbeck overstates the evil machinations of the \\"bad guys\\" and the good-natured intentions of the \\"good guys.\\" All the police and the bankers and the landowners are thoroughly malevolent; all the displaced migrant workers and the sharecroppers are faultless (or their shortcomings are unsophisticated, understandable, or well-meaning). As a result, the novel reads in a few places like agitprop rather than fiction.<br />Of course, that was Steinbeck's intent: he wanted to wake up the country. Yet, as a work of art, this style doesn't date well. Nevertheless, only a cynic or a monopolist could be unmoved by the story of the Joad family. It is truly a classic proletarian novel.ving in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable.

It is also infuriating, perplexing, reductive, and--at times--vague. (Please note: I am not convinced that the multiverse as Deutsch describes it exists, nor am I threatened by the possibility that it might. As a result, I do not mean to quarrel with--or support--the idea itself. Instead, I am reviewing Deutsch's book from the point of view of a lay reader.)<br />I do recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a summary of the pursuit of a \\"theory of everything\\" and a defense of the science of parallel universes. Deutsch's theory of everything depends on four theories: quantum (as espoused by Everett), epistemology (Popper), evolution (Dawkins), and computation (Turing). Even if one does not ultimately agree with Deutsch's ideas, his book offers some interesting thought experiments (the chapter on \\"time travel\\" is especially fun) and a concise overview of several scientific trends. In addition, his book provides a decent defense of why the theory of the multiverse should be considered a reasonable explanation for the interference results obtained the infamous two-slit experiment.<br />That said, I do think Deutsch's book contains many shortcomings. First, although the multiverse may be a valid explanation for interference phenomenon, Deutsch fails to convince that it is THE explanation. In one short paragraph, he dismisses David Bohm's theory of wave-particle duality. \\"Working out what Bohm's invisible wave will do requires the same computations as working out what trillions of shadow photons will do.\\" One could easily reverse this sentence as a criticism of Everett and Deutsch: that the trillions of unseen photons requires the same computations as working out what Bohm's single invisible wave will do. Deutsch does not explain (in this book, anyway) why trillions of photons are simpler than one wave, and he does his readers a disservice by pretending that Bohm's work does not deserve a full refutation.<br />Second, and similarly, Deutsch dismisses with an even shorter paragraph the charge that his \\"theory of everything\\" is anthropocentric. (He pretty much admits it is, but tries--unconvincingly, to this reader--to turn it into an argument in his favor.) Third, his discussion of evolution (one of the four \\"equal\\" strands of his theory of everything) is a mere 25 pages and, unlike the rest of the book, is at times incomprehensible and seems completely indebted to Dawkins. (Not that there is anything wrong with Dawkins's work; rather, Deutsch just seems in over his head during this part of the book.) Fourth, he rejects Kuhn's belief in the rigidity of scientific paradigms (for example, the inability of thinkers in Galileo's time to accept the full implications of the Copernican system because they were so used to thinking of the world in Ptolemaic and Judeo-Christian terms), but then he describes a modern scientific establishment that refuses to accept the multiverse implications of quantum theory because they are rooted to the concept of a single universe. (Just because modern scientific discourse is more civil does not mean that Kuhn's argument is incorrect. Deutsch's opponents are still mocking him behind his back, in book reviews, and anonymously on this Web site. Or, even more effectively, they are ignoring him altogether.) And, finally, his discussion of Tipler's omega-point theory is hurried and unfortunately nebulous: at one point, Deutsch seems to be saying that knowledge in the universe will become omniscient and omnipresent--which is practically the same as saying that the universe will become itself.<br />Nevertheless, regardless of what you think of its implications, Deutsch's views deserve serious consideration and, as necessary, rebuttal--not mockery and scorn. In the same way that we read Lucretius even though we know him to be wrong (or, for that matter, Einstein because we believe he is mostly right), we should read Deutsch's work because he challenges the way we look at our world.), we should read Deutsch's work because he challenges the way we look at our world.	2002-05-12

Like her previous works, this last of Welty's novels deals primarily with emotions rather than actions, with character rather than plot. Unlike any of her previous novels, however, this short work has both feet planted firmly in the last half of the twentieth century.<br />Laurel, a widow not entirely recovered from the loss of her husband many years earlier, returns home and finds herself completely without family. Her father dies, leaving in his wake the appropriately named Fay, a vulgar second wife who represents everything Laurel isn't and her mother wasn't. The rest of the novel describes the various attempts by Fay and by the friends of her father to reshape their recollections of his life to their own needs; a particular humorous scene describes four elderly neighborhood women criticizing both Fay and the deceased--more to affirm their own sense of superiority than to comfort Laurel, who endures every word of their conversation. After Fay leaves town for a few days with her trailer-trash relatives (who cause quite a stir when they show up for the funeral), Laurel is left alone to wander through her childhood home and wonder about her family's past. By the end of the novel, Laurel realizes that neither Fay nor her father's neighbors can take away the only things left in her life: her memories of her parents and her future.<br />Because of its leisurely pacing, this book isn't for everyone. To say that nothing happens is not entirely accurate: although it's a short book, it's difficult to summarize in even a few paragraphs. It is beautifully written, it's easy to read, and the novel has richly drawn characters--but some readers may feel the novel itself lacks character. Once I finished the book, I was not sure whether or not I liked it, and I don't feel it's her best. At times the book almost collapses under the weight of its own heavy-handed symbols: the birds, the mountains, the thunderstorm, the breadboard. The novel repays a few hours of reflection and rereading, however: passages that are seemingly unrelated to the main narrative eventually make sense. What saves \\"The Optimist's Daughter,\\" in the end, is both its ability to haunt the reader and Welty's sure-handed understanding of humanity.acks character.

L. Doctorow, and (to a lesser extent) Mark Helprin. Chabon brilliantly interweaves the story of two fictional comic-book artists and their creations, showing how their lives influence their stories and how their art in turn insinuates itself into their lives (to their success as much as to their ruin). Exciting and epic, humorous and heartwarming, the novel grabbed me with its intriguing first sentence and didn't let go until--less than 48 hours later--I mournfully reached the last page.<br />The prose is masterful. A \\"flatulent poison-green river\\" separates Brooklyn and Manhattan; a woman boasts an \\"extravagant flying buttress of a nose\\"; a man has \\"skin the color of boiled newspaper.\\" Framing these vibrant phrases are such throwaway quips as \\"In the immemorial style of young men under pressure, they decided to lie down for a while and waste time.\\" Even the most seasoned writer must envy Chabon's ability to fill the novel with such vivid description and snappy witticisms, all the while keeping the action flowing at a vigorous pace.<br />Any book this popular will have its detractors. The two most-often repeated complaints are the novel's length and florid style and its meandering second half and unresolved ending. I suppose in the age of MTV and factoids, the first objection is inevitable. (One amazon reader who apparently thinks literature began with Hemingway and ended with Carver gripes that Chabon's prose contains--heaven forbid--adjectives.) The second objection is a bit more understandable, but I'm glad that the author chose not to make his novel as tightly plotted as an Indiana Jones movie. Instead, \\"Kavalier and Clay\\" is as sprawling and unpredictable and fluid as life itself.	2002-05-04

This profound and haunting novel features Murdoch's unique blend of religious preoccupations, sexual politics, and philosophy (or, as she more accurately referred to it elsewhere, \\"moral psychology\\")--but, in spite of its many-layered symbolism, it still manages to be surprisingly suspenseful. If you've never read a book by Iris Murdoch and are interested in finding a good place to start, read \\"The Bell.\\"<br />A sort of psychological detective novel, the story is told through the eyes a leader of a lay religious community who is haunted by secrets from his past and also from the perspective of two visitors: a carefree woman returning to her boorish husband who is studying at a nearby convent and an innocent youth hoping to be inspired by the community's spiritual atmosphere before he goes to Oxford. The plot revolves around a bell missing for centuries and the community's plans to replace it with a new one, but I will say nothing else that might give it away.<br />The first half of the book is a very British comedy of manners (and it is at times very funny), but then things get out of hand when the two visitors, both knowingly and unwittingly, set into motion a series of tragic events that shatter the faith and foundations of the group. Although I was constantly surprised by the book's twists and turns, when I finished the novel I felt that all the events were very nearly pre-ordained by the actions and ethics of its characters.<br />Murdoch's genius is her ability to pose many complicated questions and provide just enough for readers to decide for themselves. Are the visitors responsible for destroying the community's equanimity or were they simply the catalyst that exposed the hypocrisies and self-centeredness of the commune's members? Must a person transcend selfishness in order to influence others for the better? Does it take tragedy to bring out the best in people? Is it ever really possible to wall oneself away from the rest of the world?<br />It seems almost incidental in this day and age to acknowledge that the novel portrays two gay men in a sympathetic manner astonishing for a book published in 1958--yet another aspect that displays the power and forwardness of Murdoch's thinking.st incidental in this day and age to acknowledge that the novel portrays two gay men in a sympathetic manner astonishing for a book published in 1958--yet another aspect that displays the power and forwardness of Murdoch's thinking.	2002-04-29

Instead, she takes our current afflictions (global warming, drug epidemics, lawless gangs, worsening schools, inner-city poverty) and projects them unabated thirty years into the future, creating a civilization that is just a single Great Depression away from our own--or, for that matter, one that already exists in many underdeveloped, war-torn countries.(And I am writing this review minutes after reading a front-page newspaper article about how water prices will skyrocket this summer because of the decade-old drought.)<br /><br />In this world, the United States has been overrun by drug-crazed gangs, water and food shortages, vigilante groups, and corporate towns. Lauren Olamina must cope not only with this dystopian nightmare but also her own debilitating and psychosomatically-induced empathy to feel the actual pain anyone experiences when hurt or killed in her sight. After the total destruction of her guarded and secluded neighborhood, she heads north, attracting along the way a ragtag band of homeless followers who eventually regard her as their leader.<br /><br />Much has been made of the \\"religious\\" aspect of the novel: some readers find that it resonates with the own beliefs, while others feel that the verses Lauren writes are trivial and her ideas simplistic. An interesting blend of Buddhism and early Christianity written in Taoist aphorisms, \\"Earthseed\\" is really nothing more than a realistic and understandable attempt by a teenager to cope with the daily horrors of the world in which she lives. Butler is certainly not trying to create a new religion; rather, she is showing how such philosophies are created and how desperate people sometimes (successfully) develop new principles to deal with harsh changes in their world. As Butler herself points out in an interview appended to the book, she created this religion for her fictional characters: \\"She didn't have to be always right, but she had to be reasonable.\\" (Both the interview and reader's guide at the end of this trade paperback edition are unusually insightful.)<br /><br />Octavia Butler is the only science fiction writer ever to be awarded a MacArthur Foundation \\"genius\\" grant.

It is a slender book--both in length and in substance--but the lyrical quality of Carr's prose enhances a simple and charming \\"old-fashioned\\" story.<br />Tom Birkin returns from the First World War with a shattered body and to a shattered marriage. He spends a summer in a small church in a Yorkshire village and rescues a mural that had been covered by hundreds of years of paint and grime and had only recently been detected by the locals. As he restores the painting, he finds himself equally renewed, especially as several of the villagers adopt him as one of their own. There are a couple of small surprises concerning one of the friends he makes and the painting itself, but for the most part the story is like a leisurely vacation in the English countryside.<br />It`s fair to compare this story to a Merchant-Ivory production (but without the lush landscapes). A period piece written in 1980, it feels like (as one reader points out) it could have been written in the 1920s. That is both the book's accomplishment and its weakness: although Carr impressively reproduces the tone of the era and its people, I couldn't help but compare his book to novels by, say, E. M. Forster (whose writing his occasionally resembles) or D. H. Lawrence and reflect that Carr just can't quite fill their shoes. (In his excellent introduction, Michael Holroyd reminds us that Carr initially wanted to invoke the work of Thomas Hardy, but, like Holroyd, I couldn't detect much of a likeness beyond the superficial.) Nevertheless, \\"A Month in the Country\\" is a worthwhile read, especially if you approach the book with reduced expectations.	2002-04-20

The cause for the celebration is Granny Vaughn's 90th birthday, but the relations also gather for her grandson Jack's return from prison and to learn that the schoolteacher who had taught (and tortured) three generations of Banner's inhabitants has passed away that very morning.<br />Told almost entirely in dialogue, this novel reads like one of the lengthiest plays ever written. Welty moves from one conversation to the next, recording every word spoken by every character, rarely describing what they are thinking or how they are feeling, and supplying the \\"action\\" only when necessary. I can imagine that some might find this technique tiresome, but I couldn't stop turning the pages. Yes, it's a long read, but it's an easy one.<br />The novel displays Welty's usual small-town humor: townfolk so closely bound that they are unable to hold a grudge (Jack even comes to the aid of the judge who sentenced him), rapid-fire and droll sarcasm among family members (\\"What's a morning yell for?\\" \\"Mainly to show you're still alive after the night.\\"), and rural parochialism and ignorance that are more endearing than disquieting. The one surprise (for Welty) is the pure slapstick of the situation created when the judge's car teeters on the edge of an incline--which it does for most of the length of the novel--and the family's various attempts to bring it safely down; the last chapter is more Keystone Cops than her usual high-brow Faulkner-style wit.<br />Like the book's many outsiders (Jack's wife, the schoolteacher, an aunt newly married into the family, the judge and his wife), the reader ultimately succumbs to the charm and magnetism of the Banner community. Any attempt to resist is just a losing battle.	2002-04-16

The title, cover art, and (to some extent) the blurbs led me to believe that it was about tattoo artists or skinheads or the East Village or whatever. (For the record, I do not have any tattoos and have no interest in getting one.)<br />I now regret not having read this memoir sooner.<br />This is not a book about tattoos. Rather, Trachtenberg uses his seven tattoos as a simple yet effective framework for not only his autobiographical narrative, but also his literary studies, theological musings, and cultural explorations. His story is familiar: self-destruction exacerbated by drug abuse, a love-hate bond with his parents, an inability to commit to relationships. What distinguishes this memoir from the many (tiresome) confessional accounts flooding the market are a self-mocking wit, the willingness to assume responsibility for his mistakes, and--most of all--the grace and hilarity of his prose. (I challenge anyone not to laugh aloud while reading his discourse on Christ's stigmata or his tale of attempting Zen meditation under the influence of speed.)<br />The breadth of his recall of literature is impressive--from James Boswell to Philip K. Dick. In one chapter, he brilliantly weaves a reading of \\"Lord Jim\\" into both an account of his travels in Borneo and a reminiscence of his affair with a Native American woman. In another, he entwines a fictional noir script (a la James M. Cain) with his tale of a writer whose stories increasingly resemble the details of their own friendship.<br />Equally impressive is his knowledge of religious customs; he is able to lampoon just about every faith with equal verve. (\\"Hell isn't even mentioned in the Torah. The closest thing you find is Sheol, a dusty gray underworld that's as inclusive as the Hard Rock Cafe and, I'm sure, as dreary: Anyone can get in; everyone will.\\") Some might find his mockery of religion blasphemous, but his skewering seems far more fond than venomous.<br />Both \\"Kirkus Reviews\\" and a customer's post on this Web site mock this book as an \\"exercise in self-indulgence.\\" But isn't that the very definition of any memoir? Other readers might wonder: who is this guy; why is his life so interesting that I should bother reading about it? But we don't enjoy reading about Clarissa Dalloway or Stephen Dedalus because they have fascinating or unusual lives. Instead, like good fiction, Trachtenberg's memoir succeeds because he takes the oft-old tale of decline and recovery and turns it into a clever, coherent, captivating narrative.fond than venomous.<br />Both \\"Kirkus Reviews\\" and a customer's post on this Web site mock this book as an \\"exercise in self-indulgence.\\" But isn't that the very definition of any memoir?

US	41905526	R3UX8FSBM70MWR	0375503587	960148459	Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania	Books	2	45	56	N	N	A manic memoir, but not "a memoir of mania"	Ostensibly a book about one man's bout with manic depression, this memoir chronicles Behrman's dizzying journey from part-time male hustler / full-time white-collar professional to convicted felon for art forgery. This period of his life is filled with sexual confusion, financial worries, unrealizable ambitions, stunning successes, equally spectacular failures, compulsive shopping, substance abuse, frenzied traveling, selfish stunts, generous acts, and ridiculously long work hours.<br />And that's the problem with this book. Although Behrman describes the events leading up to his conviction and therapy, you never get a sense of how his behavior or his actions stem from his illness. I do not mean do imply that the author is not manic-depressive; rather he fails to convey how his experience is any different from your average Wall Street broker, celebrity, advertising director, crystal meth addict, bartender, alcoholic, or Enron executive--or, for that matter, just about any young male living in New York City. After finishing this book, I still have absolutely no idea what it's like to be manic-depressive.<br />Indeed, the book at time seems more an autobiography of addiction than \\"a memoir of mania.\\" Although one psychologist suggests substance abuse is a common symptom of manic depression, it`s a marvel that no psychologist or psychiatrist, at least according to the author, speculates at any time that addiction may be the root of Behrman's problems. By his own account, he is continuously and excessively drinking, snorting cocaine, freebasing, and abusing the many prescriptions his doctors supply to him. The author even compares the sensations caused by electroshock therapy to the enjoyment of \\"everything I liked to abuse--alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, sex,\\" and his full recovery occurs only when he finally stops drinking and using drugs.<br />Reading his confessions, any sensible reader is going to waver among the four reactions that appear in other reviews on this Web site and elsewhere: (1) Behrman may well be manic-depressive; (2) the diagnosis of manic depression could be as wrong as the previous diagnoses supplied to him by a number of respected psychologists and psychiatrists; (3) the author may have accepted this particular diagnosis because it provided him with an excuse for his irresponsible and embarrassing behavior; or (4) he misses the limelight so much that he has pulled off yet another stunt by publishing this book. Behrman's account doesn't really persuade the reader which of the possibilities should be believed.<br />And then there's his writing style. The fragmented, journalistic staccato may have been meant to be \\"manic,\\" but instead it's just tedious. While many of the situations Behrman gets himself into are actually quite funny or tense, the prose overall is astonishingly flat and without any sense of wit or suspense. The exception is the retelling of his first electroshock treatments, when the memoir becomes, at long last, surprisingly humorous and affecting. But, for the reader, it's an awfully long haul to the payoff of those few pages.b site and elsewhere: (1) Behrman may well be manic-depressive; (2) the diagnosis of manic depression could be as wrong as the previous diagnoses supplied to him by a number of respected psychologists and psychiatrists; (3) the author may have accepted this particular diagnosis because it provided him with an excuse for his irresponsible and embarrassing behavior; or (4) he misses the limelight so much that he has pulled off yet another stunt by publishing this book.

You can almost imagine Edna Earle sitting in her rocking chair on the front porch, dryly commenting on the goings-on in Clay County and the foibles of its Dickensian population.<br />Edna Earle looks out for her overly generous Uncle (who \\"may not have a lot of brains\\" but is \\"blessed with a fond and loving heart\\"), looks up to her ornery Grandpa (whose fear of electricity motivated him to cover the roof \\"with lightning rods the way Grandma would sprinkle coconut on a cake\\"), and looks down at the white-trash Peacock family (the type of folk who would \\"wave at trains till the day they die\\"). When Uncle Daniel up and marries one of the Peacock daughters, the next thing you know she's dead and he's on trial for murder.<br />A quick read--and well worth it--\\"The Ponder Heart\\" never loses its colloquial appeal or its comic pacing. I only wish it were longer.	2002-03-10

Some readers mistakenly identify these four tales as a novella, but the stories, while interrelated, are self-contained. (Only the first part is about a red pony; it is also the best of the lot. The fourth part, \\"The Leader of the People,\\" was added to \\"The Red Pony\\" years later, when the four stories were collected into a separate edition.) While often taught in schools, these stories were never meant for very young children--in spite of the title and the subject matter. Concerning a young boy and his relationship with his parents and a wise ranch hand, they are about aging and dying, growing up and growing old, and learning that one's elders are not invincible.<br />But there are other treasures in \\"The Long Valley\\" as well; what is unique about a few of the stories is that, for once, Steinbeck creates distinctive female characters. My favorites are \\"The Chrysanthemums,\\" about a young woman's dashed dreams; \\"The White Quail,\\" about a husband's betrayal of his wife's trust; \\"Flight,\\" about a hunted fugitive; and \\"The Vigilante,\\" about a lynching--told from the point of view of one of the perpetrators. Far less impressive are \\"The Snake,\\"  which aspires to Poe but is mostly unpleasant, and \\"The Raid,\\" one of Steinbeck's many (and least inspiring) narratives concerning labor conflict.<br />The odd story in this collection is \\"Saint Katy the Virgin,\\" a satirical fable set in the Middle Ages about a demonic pig that converts to Catholicism. It's a hoot.	2002-03-09
US	41905526	R2M781M1FFVGXU	0441007317	101055477	The Left Hand of Darkness (Ace Science Fiction)	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	A descriptive (rather than predictive) SF classic	The premise is startlingly original: Le Guin creates a world populated by hermaphroditic humans and then describes what might happen when individuals on this planet first encounter a lone representative from \\"normal\\" (dual sexual) human civilizations.<br /><br />Like the best science fiction novels, this one borrows heavily from other genres. The first two hundred pages read like a political/espionage thriller and then, surprisingly, the story turns into a tale of adventure and survival (clearly influenced by Jack London), as two fugitives cross the uninhabitable tundra of the planet of Gethen (or Winter). It is the last part of this book, I suspect, that some diehard SF readers find boring or disappointing; it could have easily taken place in our own Arctic zone. Rather than focus on how the people of Gethen as a whole might react to the arrival of alien beings (a la \\"Independence Day\\"), Le Guin concentrates on the plight of two individuals, and, quite believably I think, explores how they come to accept each other, even though they are from different worlds and of different sexualities.<br /><br />As Le Guin herself notes in the introduction, this book is not \\"extrapolative\\"; her fiction is not in the business of predicting the future. Instead, she invents a civilization that resembles our own, since, in many ways, we all are confusedly androgynous. As a result, she succeeds in creating a profoundly humane and deeply moving book.	2002-03-08

As one of the characters remarks, the family takes \\"you in circles, whirling delightedly about [but} nothing really so very much happened.\\" Anyone expecting a page-turner about plantation life or a thickly plotted potboiler will surely be disappointed. Instead, you must be willing to believe that \\"old stories, family stories, Mississippi stories [are] the same as very holy or very passionate.\\"<br />The plot, such as it is, is simple: the extended Fairchild family reunites for a wedding, and everyone brings their dreams, memories, grudges, and intrigues. As with any \\"typical\\" family reunion, there is a pervasive threat of scandal that never quite pans out, and several petty incidents get blown out of proportion by the affected characters. The sheer number of kinfolk can be overwhelming at times, but they are clearly delineated (although it must be said that the black servants rarely transcend stereotype, which is undoubtedly an accurate portrayal of how a rich Southern family would have viewed the help). Welty's drawling humor gives the narrative much warmth and vitality; her ability to switch perspective seamlessly from one character to the next is truly without equal.<br />All in all, Welty writes beautifully of familial relations and social manners; she can truly be considered the Jane Austen of the South.	2002-03-02

The result is a wickedly funny (if slight) adult fantasy, complete with the usual cast: a beautiful young girl, a stepmother, and a good number of Disneyesque dimwits. There are no hidden meanings or surprise plot twists--this is just a fanciful yarn cleverly told with great wit and style.	2002-02-23

Both themes crop up throughout Dangor's novel: the fable of the man who turns into a tree, a Muslim of Indian descent who reinvents himself as a \\"white\\" Jew, and the nation of South Africa itself, before and after apartheid.<br />Nearly all of its characters, both white and \\"colored,\\" live miserable, violent lives--symptomatic of the brutal apartheid realm. Yet Dangor convincingly adopts an astonishing range of voices: the conservative Muslim ashamed of his brother's \\"passing,\\" his perceptive wife who unexpectedly leaves him, his rebellious and cynical teenage daughter, the married psychotherapist with whom he has an affair (and who may or may not be a psychopathic killer). And the novel's violent conclusion actually offers hope: that South Africa may be able to purge itself of its complicated history, just as some of the novel's women are able to leave behind the pasts that torment them.<br />Readers who enjoy straightforward plots, explicit symbolism, and unambiguous endings will surely be perplexed by this novel; even the family trees and the glossary won't help much in untangling the book's many possible meanings. The story is often as blurry as the racial lines created during apartheid. Yet I cannot get this novel and its lyricism out of my mind; the more I think about it, the more it seems to make sense of the nonsensical, schizophrenic society in which these people somehow managed to live.	2002-02-13

During the past century, the novel's reception has evolved much like its lead character: while early critics and readers praised the book as a literary parody bordering on farce, later generations have regarded the novel more as a commentary both on sexual roles and on the oppression of women. Some readers will see Orlando as representing, in human form, the evolution of literature (it`s telling that the only other character who lives as long as Orlando is a critic); some will focus on the novel's presentation of gender and sex. Both interpretations (and others) seem to be equally valid--which is why this book is so powerful even today.<br />One of the most charming (and surprising) qualities of the novel is Woolf's refusal to take herself or her book seriously. At times, the novel is laugh-out-loud funny. She mocks her own style (she interrupts one of her infamous run-on paragraphs with \\"nature ... has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence\\"), and she even makes fun of the book's very concept (when Orlando is not doing much of anything, Woolf exclaims: \\"If only subjects ... had more consideration for their biographers!\\"). \\"Orlando\\" infuses everyday life with both wit and elegance; or, as Woolf puts it, \\"when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly.\\"	2002-01-27

So \\"The Pastures of Heaven,\\" undeservedly one of Steinbeck's least-known works, is a pleasant and affecting surprise--a volume of interlinking stories (simply called \\"chapters\\") whose mature style and semi-mystical themes remind me, oddly enough, of Garcia Marquez. This collection is not your typical Steinbeck, but it's memorable and astonishingly elegant nonetheless.<br />Although every story in the book has something to recommend it (I can't imagine any reader not liking at least several of them), I especially enjoyed one, labeled Chapter VI. (The story must have had particular resonance for Steinbeck as well, since he later published it separately in a private edition entitled \\"Nothing So Monstrous\\" and added an epilogue.) About a widower who faces the community's disapproval of the unorthodox way he raises his son, this edisode will haunt me for some time. The price of the book is worth this \\"chapter\\" alone.	2002-01-20

Indeed, Albarelli notes that, a couple of weeks into his teaching stint, all the students \\"still looked the same\\" to him. My only disappointment with the book (which barely qualifies as a complaint) is that, in the end, the students are similarly indistinguishable to the reader.<br />Still, anyone will laugh out loud at Albarelli's comic and moving (mis)adventures and will want to know more about the Hasidic community for which he worked as an English teacher.	2002-01-13

After 100 pages, I found myself turning the pages almost faster than I could read them.<br />What mars Britain's first novel, however, is her rather pedestrian writing style. (Writing a back-cover blurb comparing the author with Tolkien, Marion Zimmer Bradley simply embarrasses herself.) The number of sentences beginning with inert phrases (It was... It had... There would... This was...) is nearly deadening, especially in the opening descriptive passages. Nevertheless, as the action intensifies, Britain's writing style seems to mature (or perhaps I was too caught up in the story to be annoyed any longer).<br />Readers of fantasy novels will undoubtedly enjoy this novel, in spite of its occasionally static prose. And I, for one, can't wait for the sequel.	2002-01-08

The reviews posted so far to this site are clearly and evenly divided into two camps: those who found it enlightening and moving and those who regard it as anti-Catholic diatribe. While the book has some minor flaws, I direct most of my comments to statements made by the latter group.<br />First of all, Mr. Carroll, is still a devout Catholic: he was not \\"defrocked\\" (he left the priesthood on his own accord), and he was never \\"excommunicated\\" (this statement, repeated by many customers, is malicious--and sinful--slander). Second, many of the reviewers refer to \\"fabricated quotes\\" without ever citing any examples. In fact, the Church Fathers--John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose of Milan, and others--and later Catholic leaders all said the horribly anti-Semitic things Carroll attributed to them and, furthermore, most of the Church Fathers did advocate the forcible conversion and/or slaughter of the Jews. (All of Carroll's quotes--most of them from primary sources--can be found in the standard Catholic reference works that he cites in the bibliography.) Third, like most historians, Carroll relies on a mixture of primary and secondary sources that shows a strong command not only of the history but also of the historiography of his subject. The statements by several commentators that Carroll does not use primary sources simply shows those readers did not bother to look at the notes. (His notes often present beliefs and arguments that run counter to his own.) And, fourth, while Carroll is often critical of the Church, its history, and its teachings, his criticism can hardly be called \\"anti-Catholic\\"--unless, of course, you believe, the Church is above any criticism whatsoever.<br />Finally, this book was clearly written by a man who loves his religion and his Church, but continues to believe that both can evolve into something better. Yes, it is true that Carroll emphasizes the horrible things that Christianity and its followers have historically done to Jews; it is also true that he tends to ignore the good. But his goal is an attempt to understand how the long and sordid history of Crusades and pogroms and the horror of the Holocaust could have happened in a Christian world. Carroll correctly focuses on the bad because, when all is said and done, all the good teaching disseminated by Catholic leaders did little or nothing to save the Jews from two millennia of persecution by Christians.is true that Carroll emphasizes the horrible things that Christianity and its followers have historically done to Jews; it is also true that he tends to ignore the good.
