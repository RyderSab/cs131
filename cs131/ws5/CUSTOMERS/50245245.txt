He has done it not just in a coherent manner, but also with a touch of humourous & philosophical elements, which makes the book a surprisingly enjoyable read. Despite the fact that each valuation methods has different, or even diverse, characteristics, Dr. Razgaitis managed to clearly present how each method can be practically applied in various situations, and how these methods can be jointly applied to solve business problems. He has skillfully provided knowledge & guidelines for readers to come up with their own judgement regarding what methods to be applied in various real-world situations, rather than promoting a particular method as the 'silver bullet', like some other authors may attempt to do; this is refreshing & pragmatic as technology valuation is both art & science. The references of the book are also highly valuable, as they provides good pointers to resources that would enable readers to practice the methods.	2005-09-20

'The coming convergence of information, biology, & business' sounds like another 'management fad'; but as I enjoy 'Blur' very much, I gave the book a try & realized that my initial impression was wrong. Davis & Meyer managed to vividly elaborate their theme, with real-world examples & coherent arguments. I find their work to be highly pragmatic in guiding visionary leaders to shape their organization into an adaptable one.	2005-09-01

It is concisely written in layman's terms, with short & sweet case studies through out the book. What I find weak about the book is its limited coverage on the important topic of biotech valuation (readers who are interested in that topic can check out Peter Boer's 'Technology Valuation Solutions', or Richard Razgaitis's 'Valuation and Pricing of Technology-based Intellectual Property').	2005-08-22

There are many knowledge management frameworks out there that assist business executive to manage their intangible assets (such as Sveiby's intangible asset monitor), the practical usage of these frameworks would be greatly enhanced by incorporating the valuation aspect of intangible assets. Reilly has provided a comprehensive illustration of both the 'scientific' & 'artistic' aspects of valuating intangible assets.

Lev has provided a very concise analysis of intangible management with an economics perspective. His analysis is very systematic, robust, with support of empirical studies; his treatment of the subject is coherent & enjoyable to read.

Denning has utilized a 'story-telling' writing style to illustrate how such style has enabled him to successfully launched & sustain KM initiatives at the World Bank.

Courtney has repeatedly mentioned the non-dynamic nature of Michael Porter's competitive strategy framework, thus the need of utilizing various 'new' tools (such as Real-Option, & Simulation). I find that Porter's work on competitive advantage, value chain, clusters, do incorporate the 'dynamic nature' of the business world nowadays. What Courtney nicely provides is a systematic way to select the relevant 'tool' in the business decision process. A solid understanding & analysis based on 'classic' strategy framework (such as Porter's) is critical in order to utilize Courtney's 'new' tools to achieve business success.	2002-01-11
