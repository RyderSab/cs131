I found the basic premise of the book (i.e. Bly's introduction of the concept of the human shadow and the long bag we drag behind us) to be very solid and prescient. However, I felt that overall the book tended to be rather rambling and sometimes even incoherent, as if Bly was trying to identify a close relationship between subjects and concepts that had little or nothing to do with each other. I especially felt that the poetry discussed in the book failed to contribute anything to the subject matter. Now it could very well be that I simply missed the point; I do not proclaim to be an expert on poetry or the concept of the human shadow. But overall I did not feel like I gained a great deal from reading this book. I think Bly would have written a better and more helpful book had he concentrated more on the issue of the shadow and the \\"long bag,\\" subjects that intrigued me greatly when I read about them here for the first time. It's a short book and doesn't take long to read, so even if you don't get as much out of it as other people might, it's still worth reading simply because, if nothing else, you won't need to devote a lot of time to it.<br /><br />As for the reviewer who dismissed it as a \\"self-help\\" book, I'm not sure what to make of that comment. Some of the subjects discussed in this book entail deep, thoughtful reflection on one's own personality and being. Serious introspection and self-analysis is necessary to do the kind of work Bly talks about. I suppose anything we do to make ourselves better people can be described as \\"self-help,\\" but I don't know why in the world that would be considered a bad thing. This book certainly doesn't read like some of the superficial popular self-help books I've taken a look at over the years. Bly suggests no quick fixes or easy 1-2-3 solutions. This work is for people who are dead serious about committing themselves to an honest and almost certainly painful examination of themselves.elves to an honest and almost certainly painful examination of themselves.	2005-08-29

And unlike several other memoirs from this theatre of war, In Deadly Combat has the added benefit of being very well written (significantly better than Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier, for instance). This book gives the reader a good insight into the lives (and deaths) of \\"landsers\\" serving on the East Front, both in terms of the fighting itself and the general condition faced by the men. I have very few complaints at all about this book, but I shorted it one star for two reasons: First of all, there are no maps, and it was sometimes difficult to visualize exactly where the author was during certain points in the story even when I got out a world atlas to assist me. Second, the last chapter, which addresses his captivity, gives only a cursory overview of that experience. While this is better than not addressing it at all, the author spent nearly as much time in captivity as he did fighting, and it would have been very interesting to read more about that experience as well. In short, anyone with an interest in Germany's war against the Soviet Union will almost certainly enjoy this book and learn something from it even if you already have a good understanding of this subject.	2005-04-26

And while I'll definitely concede that it's a riveting story that does a good job of conveying the horror and suffering of that experience, I found the writing style to be rather cumbersome and even a bit annoying at times. My main complaint is the overuse of adjectives and adverbs, making it seem as if the author (or, to be fair, probably the translator) relied too heavily on a thesaurus rather than just letting the story convey the image. I also thought the author got carried away with his use of simile, often using rather odd comparisons that seemed unnatural. For these reasons alone I give the book four stars instead of five. However, the story itself is solid and after reading it I definitely felt like I had a better understanding of what life was like for the average soldier on the Eastern Front. Readers should also be aware that there are other WW II memoirs every bit as good as this one, and in some cases better in my opinion. Good ones I have read recently are \\"Being Present: Growing Up in Hitler's Germany\\" (though the author was too young to serve on the front lines), \\"A Mind in Prison: The Memoir of a Son and Soldier of the 3rd Reich\\", \\"Blood Red Snow: The Memoirs of a German Soldier on the Eastern Front\\", and \\"Soldat : Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936-1949.\\"	2005-04-22

This is one such book, and does a very good job of describing how the war affected ordinary Germans. Since the author was too young to participate in the fighting, this is not a helpful book if you want to learn about life as a front-line infantryman, but this book does add one more interesting piece to the puzzle. For readers who want to obtain a broad understanding of Germany during WW II, this is definitely a book worth reading.	2005-04-19

The reason was that the information up to that point was often so elementary that it was almost not worth reading, i.e. advice about getting a word processor (duh) and some of the tips about writing basics. However, things really picked up from there and I found the second half of the book, which dealt with the subject of getting a book published, to be very helpful and enlightening, if rather discouraging. But as a previous commenter noted, the author doesn't hold any punches and makes no attempt to sugar coat the harsh world of publishing. Personally I'm thankful for his candid observations even if they do paint a bleak picture. If the entire book were as enlightening as the second half I would easily give it five stars, but because of the shortcomings of the first half I'm only willing to give it four. It's definitely worth your time to read this book though, so don't let this criticism deter you from taking a look for yourself.	2005-03-29

Some are really great while others, like this Budapest guide, seem like little work was put into them. The sections titled Facts About Budapest, Places to Stay, Places to Eat, and Entertainment are pretty good (though still not as detailed as they might be), but I was disappointed with what I consider the most important section, Things to See and Do. For a city as big as Budapest it seemed like scant few pages were devoted to this subject. I also wish more photos were included, because it's hard to know whether something is worth going to see if you have no idea what it looks like beforehand.	2005-03-27

This can be handy for aspiring writers, but the danger is that you'll end up with very shallow characters and stories unless you explore this subject much more extensively. And although the summaries of particular themes are helpful, you would probably be better off going straight to the source and reading Campbell yourself. Otherwise you run the risk of spitting out a cookie cutter story that has all the technical ingredients of myth-based fiction but nevertheless fails to capture the reader because the story itself isn't compelling. If, as I did, you can find this book at your local library, it is probably worth your time to read it. However, I certainly wouldn't pay much money for it.	2005-03-25

The candor of this book is both startling and refreshing because it gives the reader tremendous insight into the corrosive power of Nazi propaganda and ideology. For the author to admit thinking and acting like he did must have been a painful experience, but it gives this account a sharp edge of credibility that might otherwise be lacking. In fact, it is that candor that makes this story so heartrendering. The world would be a much better place if more people would break their silence about the tragedy of Nazi Germany and share their experiences and feelings as openly and sincerely as Dr. Manz has.	2005-03-25

He moved quickly up the ranks, received minor wounds that took him out of action just when things were looking grim, and then when he was finally captured by the Soviets he spent most of his captivity in a camp near Moscow where he was not required to perform any physical labor. So while his account of his experiences is quite interesting, it almost reads like Forrest Gump because he was so lucky so many times (Relatively speaking, of course. No one would argue that being in Soviet captivity for five years is any fun, but things could have been much, much worse for him). I gave this book four stars rather five simply because it doesn't give the reader as vivid a picture of life and death on the Eastern Front as other books do. This is no fault of the author's. After all, it does not appear that he ever shirked his duties. But he spent quite a lot of time visiting home and training other troops in Germany during the war and really never endured the worst of the fighting against the Soviets. And because of his rank he never had to endure the kind of suffering and misery that the grunts sitting in fox holes and trenches on the front lines went through. All this makes the book of somewhat limited value for purposes of learning what the average German soldier experienced while fighting the Soviets. However, I did enjoy reading it and it was very interesting to learn about the war from the perspective of an officer who enjoyed the privileges that Knappe did.	2005-03-19

The he survived intact through the remainder of the war through some of the worst conditions imaginable borders on miraculous, and that his written story survived all these years after being first recorded against regulations on various scraps of paper is truly amazing. And what a story it is. Koschorrek endured some of the most gut-wrenching parts of Germany's war on the eastern front and does a very good job in this book of describing what that experience was like. My only complaint is that the writing left something to be desired, as others here have also noted. Koschorrek can hardly be blamed for that though, since he is obviously not an English speaker by birth. In that case the publisher really should have used the services of a good editor to spruce up the writing and make it more vivid and emotional. For that reason only, I give this book four stars instead of five.	2005-03-14

Nearly all the elements of a timeless and spellbinding story are present, while the author's flowing writing style ties together the events with vivid prose. Enough people here have discussed the central theme of the story, so I will not repeat it here except to say that it is a heart-wrenching and evocative one that will keep your attention through the course of the entire book. So why just four stars rather than five? This book had all the makings of a full five-star rating until the conclusion. It seemed like the author struggled through the last 100 pages or so and that he finally settled on an ending that was satisfactory but not great. I thought some of the events and revelations toward the end of the book came off as a bit contrived and implausible, as if the author tried a bit too hard to tie together themes from earlier in the story and then couldn't quite figure out how to put it all together in a climactic ending. However, the overall effectiveness of the story is enough to overshadow these shortcomings, which I chalk up to the fact that this is the author's first novel. I don't give 5-star ratings here unless I can't find anything significant to criticize in the book. In this case I wish Amazon had a 10-star scale so I could give this 9 out of 10 rather than 4 out of 5. In the end I would still highly recommend this book without reservation to anyone. It came very close to being a perfect story.	2005-03-09

I'll just add my four-star rating by saying that this is a surprisingly interesting and easy to read book, given the fact that the main topic is not something one might expect to be particularly captivating. But Turner's excellent writing style, combined with an amazing amount of research spanning several topics from history to religion, makes this a thoroughly enjoyable book from front to back. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars was that, if anything, it's a bit too long and spends too much time going into excrutiating detail on minor points. I think the author could have shortened this book by nearly a hundred pages and still achieved the full effect he intended. However, he certainly does present an exhaustive discussion of this topic and I am amazed at how much I learned. One final note: Perusing through the bibliography after I finished, I was utterly astonished at the volume of research the author did for this book. I cannot imagine how much time he spent putting together this delightful book, though I'm certainly thankful for his efforts.	2005-02-23

If you're the kind of person who needs the reassurance of a staunchly pro-American ideological screed to sooth your delicate sentimentalities and shore up your patriotism without questioning your beliefs, this is definitely not the book for you. But if you go into this book with an open mind, willing to have your preconceptions about your country challenged, you will learn a lot from it, albeit painfully.<br /><br />This book seems to have two main purposes: First, to dispense with the notion that terrorism carried out by Muslims is somehow an intrinsic element of either Islam or Muslim culture; and second, to identify the root causes of that terrorism. The second point is actually a bit more complex though, because what the author really sets out to do is blame the US for causing terrorism. And although he makes some excellent and well-supported points, this is one of the weaknesses of the book, as I'll discuss below.<br /><br />It was only natural for me to squirm a bit when I read many of the accusations in this book, and because I'm not the kind of person who immediately believes everything he reads in a book that is very obviously tilted heavily toward a single viewpoint I did not simply swallow everything the author says. However, I have to concede that, on most of the major points, I cannot offer a rebuttal. One would think that a book of this nature would spawn a mountain of heated and defensive responses, but I have been very surprised to find that the overwhelming response has been no response at all. In fact, I have been unable to find a single rebuttal to anything in this book. It has either somehow managed to remain under the radar of its likely critics or those critics simply have nothing to say in response.<br /><br />In the end I shorted this book one star because there were several glaring problems in both the central thesis and some of the factual details, some of which I'll mention here. Before beginning it is important to point out that the author goes to great pains to essentially blame the US for the very existence of Muslim terrorism today. But focusing on such a narrow mission I believe he goes astray from time to time and loses some credibility in what is otherwise a very well-reasoned book. First is his claim that the US was \\"the source\\" of chemical weapons to Iraq. This is simply not true, and while the US certainly did help Iraq develop its chemical and biological weapons programs, it is well-documented that Iraq's program was the product of a fairly fragmented system involving quite a lot of other countries.<br /><br />The author makes the point several times that terrorism is a political response to certain repressive conditions rather than simply a religious response. And while I agree with this 100%, he overplays his hand by next claiming that the US is primarily to blame for the political conditions to which terrorists are responding. In doing so the author almost completely ignores decades of often brutal oppression by Muslim governments. Perhaps it is convenient for disenfranchised elements of the populations in those countries to blame the US for their plight in life (and to be sure, the governments often promote that view as a safety valve to shield themselves), but that doesn't mean they are correct in blaming the US. The author should have explored the subject of Muslim oppression of other Muslims much more thoroughly. Somewhat related to this issue is the fact that the governments and people of many Muslim countries (such as Saudi Arabia) have contributed a tremendous amount of support to terrorist organizations. The author acknowledges this in passing but fails to explore it further, focusing instead on how actions of the US have contributed to terrorism.<br /><br />Where the author really went overboard was his claim that the US committed widespread war crimes and used weapons of mass destruction during the first Gulf War, in Afghanistan, and in Kosovo. Specifically, he says the use of depleted uranium weapons, cluster bombs, and Mark-77 firebombs violated humanitarian law because they are \\"incapable of distinguishing between civil and military targets.\\" He also says the US conducted bombing with no regard to the civilian population. These claims are really quite silly. Had the US really wanted to kill the civilian populations in those engagements it could very easily have conducted the sort of saturation bombing so prevalent during WW II. Instead, it is quite clear that great pains were taken to minimize civilian casualties in all these engagements. The fact that these efforts were not always successful does not mean the US simply disregarded those concerns. With regard to the specific weapons used, there really is no such thing as a weapon that can distinguish between civil and military targets. The best one can do is try to hit the intended target, but obviously that doesn't always work as planned. I feel that I need to specifically address depleted uranium weapons. The author makes it sound like some kind of nuclear weapon was used, when in fact it is simply a very dense metal (albeit one with low grade radioactivity) used in armor-piercing munitions and even in the armor of some vehicles. Even after it impacts with a target it does not add significantly to the normal background radiation we encounter in the natural environment every day. And while the potential danger of these materials is not disputed, there is a lot of misinformation out there about them, and their long-term health risk is very debatable. Referring to them as a \\"weapon of mass destruction\\" and calling their use a \\"war crime\\" is way over the top and exposes the author's predisposition.<br /><br />There are other instances where the author overreached, but this book review is already long enough and I don't want to nitpick every single little point I disagreed with. In the end the problems I have identified do not negate the central theme of the book. However, they do damage the credibility of the author a bit and help illustrate how the book goes a bit off course by focusing almost solely on the US rather than discussing many other factors that have contributed to terrorism. I still believe this book is very much worth reading, with the understanding that the reader will encounter some claims that need not be accepted as completely accurate or evenhanded.mitted widespread war crimes and used weapons of mass destruction during the first Gulf War, in Afghanistan, and in Kosovo.

This is due in part to the unique nature of the Greek Islands, which are a very diverse and complex collection of locations, cultures, landscapes, and even climates. There are significant logistical concerns because getting to some of these islands can be tricky. And there's also the fact that, while some places cater to package tourists and are overrun with people during certain times of the year, others are far more remote and peaceful. Sadly, this book fails to capture any of these important themes, much less convey them in the kind of detail necessary to make a useful travel Guide.

However, I was disappointed that it lacks the kind of detail and good street maps that many other Lonely Planet guides offer. There must be something about the Lonely Planet guides for Greece because the one for Crete is really substandard. And since this book contains the same kind of information about Crete but in a condensed format, it means you really get short-changed on that island. Like I said, this is definitely one of the better guides about the Greek Islands, but I have to say I think the Eyewitness Travel Guide for the Greek Islands edges it out slightly. I should point out that I do not typically use travel books to find hotels and restaurants because those subjects always leave out tons of other options and are often outdated. I find the web more useful instead. This book does include a lot of that information, which I essentially ignored. If you like that kind of information in a book then you might prefer this one over the Eyewitness Travel Guide.	2005-02-15

Although the major islands are covered in some detail, this book almost entirely ignores a lot of other islands, even some that are quite large. This is a real disappointment because the true wonder of the Greek Island experience is that you can travel to all kinds of places, some very small but no less significant. A good travel guide for the Greek Islands therefore needs to include just as much detail about these less-visited islands as it does about the more well-traveled ones. This book also lacks a lot of the photograps that other books include, which I think is important because the Greek Islands are so diverse. It really does help to see pictures of the islands to help you decide which ones to visit. If you're planning a trip to the Greek Islands you can do much better than this book for a travel guide.	2005-02-15

Personally I think this is a great book to use while making preliminary travel plans because it's very difficult to decide where to go if you can't see pictures of it first. Then once you narrow down your choices you'll want a more comprehensive travel guide, such as the Lonely Planet guides, which contain better maps, travel information, hotels, etc, but which have very few photos. I'm holding off on giving this book 5 stars because it lacks that kind of detail.

It is less of an instructional book and more of a public venting of frustration by Ms. Truss, who somehow managed to write a book about punctuation that is all at once funny, witty, and entertaining, yet still very much instructional as well. If confusion of \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" is the kind of transgression that drives you to the brink of violence, you are almost certainly a \\"stickler\\" of the magnitude discussed in the book; the kind of person who believes that people who commit such egregious offenses, \\"deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.\\" In fact, I may very well have committed a similar but less serious offense by using a semicolon in that last sentence as I did, but I'm sticking with it, and that's that.<br /><br />My point is simply that anyone who appreciates proper use of punctuation, who has a wry sense of humor, and who sometimes feels like they are the last person on Earth who still cares about this subject will almost certainly enjoy reading this book. And when you really get down to it, that's what matters the most.	2005-01-19

Life: What Lawyers Are Afraid to Say About the Legal Profession	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Should be required reading for all aspiring lawyers	A seasoned attorney gave me this book when I was in my third year of law school. Eight years later I remain very grateful that I received this gift, because it is the most poignant, blunt, and accurate synopsis of the legal profession I have ever come across. The point of this book is not to deter people from being lawyers or scare the daylights out of them. Rather, it aims to prepare aspiring lawyers for what lies ahead of them in the real world of the law. If you're in law school or thinking about going to law school this book will open your eyes to the practice of law, but even if you're already a practicing attorney there is plenty in here that you'll recognize and appreciate.	2005-01-18

Although I wish it had more photos give a clue as to what you'll be seeing, the excellent maps, detailed descriptions, and sheer volume of information provided more than makes up for it. I had only a few days in Arizona and didn't have time to waste, so it was important that I find the best places to see while I was there. This book proved to be absolutely vital for my trip. Without it I would never have found many of the interesting sights that I visited. In short, don't go to Arizona without this book.	2005-01-18

You'd think that, by now, there would be scads of them, but the reality is that this book is truly a diamond in the rough. It is nothing short of amazing how Tuchman guides the reader through such an immense amount of detailed information about the war, and in such a relatively short volume. If it is true that we are doomed to repeat the past if we fail to understand it, then this is one book that everyone should read.	2005-01-18

That's a real shame considering the hardships and horrors endured by the men who served in that theatre. With the Old Breed was recommended to me by a college student who read it as part of a history class assignment. I don't know how this book managed to hide under my radar for so long, because it is absolutely outstanding. Too often, books written about a person's combat experiences are poorly written, but this plain-spoken book neither tries to be something it isn't nor falls short of good writing standards.<br /><br />I think what makes this one of the most unique personal accounts of war that I've ever read is Sledge's approach to telling his story. Nothing fancy, no poetic prose, and he doesn't engage in self-aggrandizement or philosophizing. It's just one veteran's very candid account of his experience during training and then later as a grunt in the Pacific theatre. Sledge tells it like he saw it, with no sugar-coating. His only real motive for telling his story in the first place seems to be that he had a story to tell and he felt like it was important enough to pass on to later generations. The reader will detect no attempt on Sledge's part to seek praise or admiration, despite the fact that he himself obviously suffered significantly and witnessed countless others who suffered far worse still. What the reader will get is an absolutely unimpeachable, through, and detailed account of what happened on Peleliu and Okinawa. No matter how much you know about World War II, this book will still take you on a breathtaking journey. Anyone who reads this book will have a new appreciation for what soldiers went through while fighting the Japanese during WW II. It is an essential part of any WW II buff's book collection.	2005-01-17

It is both entertaining and thought-provoking, but I want to be careful not to give it more credit that is due. In the annals of war stories this will go down as a good one, but not a great one. While it had the potential to be very thought-provoking and profound, it falls more on the side of action novel instaed. That's not to say that it's a mindless blood-and-guts story, but don't expect to come away from this feeling that you just read a work of literature. Anyone who likes WW II stories should enjoy this book as long as they don't expect too much from it.	2005-01-17

If, however, you go into it knowing that this is entirely a work of fiction very loosely imposed on the backdrop of actual history, then you may very well be delighted with it.<br /><br />I shorted it by one star for three reasons: First, I was at first put off by the first-person account given by Alexander to one of his pages. It struck me as a rather forced and unnatural way of creating an excuse for writing it in first-person. However, I did get used to it and the flowing and poetic nature of the writing more than made up for it. Second, there is the reality that nearly everything in this book is a complete fabrication, with only a very loose connection to the truth. As a work of historical fiction one has to expect that an author would take certain liberties with the facts, but this one makes almost no effort whatsoever to recite ANYTHING as it truly occurred. Pressfield could get away with this in Tides of War and Gates of Fire because his main characters were minor players in history. However, Alexander the Great is an enormous figure on the historical stage, making him less useful as a character in a work of fiction. Finally, it struck me that, in this book, Pressfield was trying too hard to emulate Eagle in the Snow, a book that obviously had a profound influcence on his writing career.<br /><br />All that being said, I still give this book four stars because I found the style of writing to be poetic and captivating. The prose carried me away and made me feel like I was right there where the action was occurring. And although Pressfield barely scratches the surface of Alexander's long campaign, one has to recognize that it would be impossible to include every important event that occurred during that journey. I thought Pressfield did a good job of choosing those events that are most important to the overall story of the book, thereby making it flow well. Finally, I got to the point where I could not put this book down, which is always a good indication that it's a good one. That more than anything else prompted me to give this book four stars rather than perhaps just three.tory of the book, thereby making it flow well. Finally, I got to the point where I could not put this book down, which is always a good indication that it's a good one.

Tim Page's Nam is one of my most cherished books about military history because the spectacular photographs succeed in conveying not just a visual depiction of the war but also the emotions of its participants (in the case of that book , focusing primarily on U.S. forces). I was therefore very excited to see this new volume compiled by Page and his team, which is full of photographs of the war from the perspective of the North Vietnamese. However, I gave this book four stars rather than five because of one disappointment I have with it: Nearly all the photos depicting battles or battlefields or in any way involve \\"the enemy\\" focus on ARVN forces. There were hardly any photos that had anything to do with U.S. forces or any of the other foreign armies defending the South. This struck me as quite odd. I realize the book's authors are limited by the photographs available to them (i.e. ones taken by photographers travelling with Viet Cong and NVA forces), but surely it can't be that these photographers never took pictures of subjects that involve forces other than the ARVN. In this sense I felt like the book fell short of telling the entire story of the other side. However, this book is still very much worth owning, so don't let my one complaint scare you away.	2005-01-07

However, it was difficult to ever sympathize with the mother because she came across as so selfish throughout the book. That could be forgiven, but the ending (which I will not give away) was so ridiculously implausible that it ruined the entire book. By that point the story had pretty much run out of steam anyway, so it would have been difficult for any ending to wrap things up satisfactorily. This book would have gone nowhere had it not been pimped by Oprah.	2005-01-02

Unfortunately its Crete guide is not one of them. This book is pitifully short on detail. It is full of generalizations with very little truly insightful information. In fact, it appears to be mainly a guide to hotels and restaurants, with comparatively scant information about the places where those hotels and restaurants are located. I found this book to be a huge disappointment and practically useless as a travel guide. An infinitely better alternative is the Rough Guide book on Crete, which is absolutely outstanding and leaves Lonely Planet in its dust.	2004-11-11

All too often guide books that cover an entire country lack the kind of detail a traveler needs, but this book did not suffer that problem at all. The section on Warsaw was actually better organized and contained more detailed factual information than the DK book dedicated solely to that city. This was the only book I needed to help me get around Krakow and Auschwitz as well. I can't speak for the hotel and restaurant recommendations in the book because I never used any of them, but as far as information about historical sites and points of interest this is an outstanding book.<br /><br />Update: In planning for my second trip to Poland, I recently purchased the Rough Guide to Poland, and I have to say it is even better than the Lonely Planet book because it includes quite a lot more detail. If you only buy one book, get the Rough Guide. But if you buy two, the Lonely Planet book is also very good.	2004-11-11

The organization of the book is very convenient and there are page references throughout the book to the topics being discussed. This makes it extremely easy to either read the book from front to back or to pick out a narrow topic and read about it. My only complaints are that I wish it had more color photos and a better map, but the information is more important than photos anyway. This book will definitely make planning your trip to Crete a lot easier. And it's much, much better than the Lonely Planet Crete guide. Lonely Planet publishes some great books, but its Crete guide is not one of them.	2004-11-11

It contains about a thousand years of detailed history written in a way that captivates the reader and makes the book hard to put down. I did notice a bit of a tendency to exagerrate Poland's importance in the scheme of European politics and history, but it was not overbearing and did not negate the many excellent qualities of the book. Obviously it's impossible to sqeeze a lot of detail into one volume covering a period of a thousand years, but this book does very good job of balancing its broad overview with the need for sufficient detail about the people, places, and events it covers. I found it to be a fascinating and enlightening introduction to Polish history and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this subject.	2004-11-11

It's really about the political events leading up to the Ottoman invasion of Austria. The siege itself and the ensuing battle are given scant attention, which was a huge disappointment for me. The political environment is an interesting subject, but the military events themselves are almost completely ignored. That's too bad, because that means only half the story is told in this book. Making matters worse is the fact that the book is a slow, dry read that failed to captivate me in any way. I'm unaware of any other books on this subject though, so I'm afraid this may be the only gig in town.	2004-11-11

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it needs a bigger map (or at least more maps showing outlying areas). The maps included in the book are great, but it would be nice to get a bigger picture of the city because not everything is centrally located. I took this book with me everywhere I went in Warsaw and it was an immense help when it came to finding important sites and identifying ones I came across while walking around. And as always, the photos in this DK publication are outstanding. This is the only travel guide you need if you're going to be visiting Warsaw, though it would be a good idea to find a full-sized map once you get there.	2004-10-26

I gave it three stars at that time because, other than the first section dealing with resistence in a practical sense, I found the rest of the book to be too esoteric. Since then I have done a tremendous amount of soul-searching regarding my inner drive to become a writer. That search took me back to this book recently, and after reading it for a second time I have to say I don't know what I was thinking when I gave it only three stars. Today I truly believe it is worthy of five stars because it struck deep into my conscience and helped me understand my situation and the situation of others like me. Anyone who is trying to tap into the inspiration they sense burning somewhere inside them that tells them to go out and write - or to create any other kind of art - will benefit tremendously if they open their minds and prepare themselves for rigorous introspection. This is not a simple self-help or how-to book. It is a truly profound examination of the human mind and the quest for fulfillment that we all feel.	2004-07-15

However, I have to agree with others here who said they found it to be unreadable. Buchan does a poor job of clearly describing much of anything. The prose is disjointed and confusing and the story jumps around in time and location without adequately explaining any one of those times or locations. It is almost unheard of for me to quit reading a book before finishing it, but I gave up on this one very early on because it utterly failed to grab me on any level. There are some truly great works of fiction out there that will capture you and hold you from cover to cover. Unfortunately this is not even close to being one of them.	2004-07-15

After the mid-point mark it began dragging, a problem I attribute mainly to two shortcomings: First, the character of Tanya was an unnecessary and unconvincing distraction. The life and death struggles faced by Zaitsev and other soldiers in Stalingrad is compelling enough without trying to cram in an unnatural love story, especially one involving someone as unsympathetic and unlikely as Tanya. Second, Robbins does a poor job of developing the character of Thorvald. Here he is, the best sniper in the entire Third Reich, yet he is depicted as lazy and inattentive. He'd have been killed during his first day in Stalingrad if he were truly as inept as he is made out to be. Another complaint I have, but one which affects the entire book as opposed to just the second half, was that the book fails to adequately depict the true human suffering that occurred in Stalingrad. The physical desolation of the city itself is depicted well, but in terms of the sheer inhumanity and awfulness of the place I thought it fell short.<br />Despite all this, I still think War of the Rats is worth reading. Just realize going into it that there are certain shortcomings that make this a good book rather than a great book and you should enjoy it.	2004-07-14

This is the first and only account I have seen about the conflict between Kansas and Missouri during the Civil War that's presented in a level-headed and objective manner. Some of the language (i.e. gratuitous use of the words &quot;Negro&quot; and &quot;Indian&quot;) serves as a frequent reminder that this book was penned during the late 1950s, but aside from that it remains quite prescient. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what Kansas was really like during the Civil War. In the end you're likely to be a bit disappointed - Not with the book, but with the realization that there were no heroes in Kansas during that time and that Kansans didn't generally stand firmly in support of the kinds of values we attribute to them today.	2004-07-10

The book is not short on details though. In 494 pages Kagan does an outstanding job of covering the entire Peloponnesian War from start to finish, giving the reading a thorough understanding of the entire affair.

The conclusions in this book are so far-fetched, so alarmist, and so downright ridiculous that they are far to numerous to address here. The book can be summed up like this: If you are an extremely conservative (socially, religiously, and politically) white Christian who thinks the world is falling apart and that the End of Days is near, you'll undoubtedly agree with everything Buchanan has to say. Everyone else will recognize this book for the utter nonsense that it is and therefore need not bother themselves with reading it.	2002-01-02
