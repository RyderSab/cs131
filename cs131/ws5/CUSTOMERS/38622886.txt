The Lincoln in the title is a car, not a President. Mickey Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer, so named because he operates out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car.<br /><br />Mickey Haller, a longtime defense lawyer, whose clientele has been restricted, of late, to small time criminals, pushers, abusers, prostitutes, etc. When he gets a referral from a bail bondsman friend of his named Fernando Valenzuela, things seem to be looking up. \\"This guy is a franchise\\" he tells Mickey, meaning a big hit - a wealthy client - from whom Mickey can earn a large fee.<br /><br />His name is Louis Rolet (pronounced Roolay), a real estate broker from Beverly Hills and he strongly professes to be something that Mickey has yet to see, a wrongly accused innocent man, who was set up by a prostitute. However, all is not as it seems. Louis is not as innocent as he claims and as Mickey's relationship with his client deteriorates, bad things start to happen to him. Suddenly Mickey realizes that he has seen an innocent man, a man he represented two years prior, who is now serving life in San Quentin but Rolet realizes it also.<br /><br />Not even the mention of Harry Bosch in The Lincoln Lawyer and yet The Lincoln Lawyer is still a compelling novel that ingratiates itself into your psyche. The Lincoln Lawyer is the sixteenth novel by Michael Connolly, a prolific and novel, mystery novelist. I have read every novel by Connelly and have enjoyed every one to varying degrees, with the possible exception of Void Moon. I think The Lincoln Lawyer is among his best.	2005-10-11

He works almost eighty hours a week as a surgeon and an ER doctor at his hospital. He does this to make ends meet, having to pay child support for his twins (a boy and a girl), whom he adores and alimony to their mother and his ex-wife, Maxine. Despite this drain on his time and finances, Will manages to support his pet projects, a mission style soup kitchen for the poor and homeless called the Open Hearth Kitchen and The Hippocrates Society, a collection of various medical practitioners who have banded together the counter the creeping influence of the dreaded heath management organizations.<br /><br />All in all, Will, who is widely respected in his field and admired for his sensitivity for his patient's welfare, has a pretty normal and uneventful life. That is until he is cajoled into representing the Society, as a last minute replacement, in a scheduled debate with Boyd Halliday, the CEO of a large and growing HMO, Excelsis Health Care. From then on his life seems to unravel. First he meets an attractive plain clothes police officer, Patty Moriarity, who is investigating a series of homicides of CEOs of three HMOs believed to be the work of a disgruntled patient or relative. At first Moriarity is attracted to Will but after she checks up on him she thinks he may possibly be involved in the murders. Then the killer calls him on his private number, congratulating Will on his skill in the debate. Then the ceiling caves in when he passes out, literally head first, into the patient's newly opened incision during surgery.<br /><br />Will wakes up in intensive care and everybody is very cool to him. When his Doctor, an old friend, comes in, he tells Will that he tested positive for a massive dose of Fantanyl, an extremely dangerous and addictive drug. Will of course, is incredulous but he and nobody else can think of how it could have been administered to him. He knows he didn't do it but it seems all his co-workers and most of his friends have made up their mind, in fact his medical license is suspended and he's banned from the hospital.<br /><br />As the story continues Will becomes the murder suspect for the serial killings, though he's never charged. He has become entangled in the web of intrigue surrounding the murders and he and Moriarity wind up fighting for their very lives.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I have read four or five novels by Michael Palmer and have enjoyed each one. The Society was not the best one but it was a very good medical thriller that had me flipping them pages. Palmer's writing style is very smooth, with just a touch of humor. He does a good job of writing his novels without going into Doctor speak but occasionally he does go into his physician mode, whereas I have a little trouble understanding but this is minimal and I simply nod my head and go on.<br /><br />The story was well written and flowed well. There was always something happening in this fast moving, fast reading novel, which made it impossible for the story to become boring. Palmer developed the characters well and you really empathized with the protagonist, Will Grant. There were several antagonists of varying degrees to dilike as well. One was Detective Brasco, an obvious chauvinist, who was in charge of the investigation, who was full of himself but couldn't seem to get out of his way. At one point approaching the end of the book Moriarity saves his life and almost gets killed herself. That was the last we heard of Brasco and I would liked to have seen some sort of resolution between he and Moriarity but it was not to be.<br /><br />If you like medical thrillers then this is right up your alley. Nobody, except maybe Robin Cook, does them better. Final rating 4.3 starsis incredulous but he and nobody else can think of how it could have been administered to him.

Balance of Power, Richard North Patterson's twelfth novel, tells a story about politics and the background posturing and backstabbing that is endemic therein. It is not a particularly pleasant book but it is interesting and well written. The core of the narrative is a battle between President Kerry Kilcannon and the SSA (Sons of the Second Amendment) obviously a pseudonym for the NRA (National Rifle Association).<br /><br />In a previous book, Kerry's brother James, had been assassinated while running for president. Kerry, who later became a U.S. Senator also was shot by a would be assassin during an election campaign. He recovers and goes on to become President. Obviously gun control is close to his heart and this book describes Kilcannon's efforts to institutionalize a modicum of safety measures in the face of the intractable SSA.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />After unraveling the president's plan to get gun manufacturer's to voluntarily provide locks for their handguns and require background checks on sales at gun shows, SSA president, Charles Dane goes on the offensive against the hated Kilcannon. As the Republican Parties main contributor, many members of the Senate and Congress are beholden to the SSA, so Dane meets with the Senate Majority leader, Frank Fasano, to go over strategy to neutralize his perceived enemy.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Shortly after taking office, President Kilcannon, a divorcee, marries his lady friend, the beautiful, former Lara Costello, previously a news correspondent. However, prior to the wedding, Lara, while in San Francisco, confronts her sister Joan, a victim of spousal abuse and forces her to talk to Kerry, who was a former prosecutor, specializing in spousal battery. After getting Joan to file a complaint against her husband, John Bowden, Police secure the gun from him that he had held to Joan's head a few days previous and he is arrested and subsequently released on bail, with the stipulation that he stay away from his wife and six year old daughter, Marie. But John is a troubled man.<br /><br />John Bowen, obtains passage to Las Vegas, where he attends a gun show purchasing a gun that has been banned in California, along with especially deadly bullets, from a private seller, at the gun show. Then he returns to California where he awaits the return of the Costello family from Washington DC, where the five Costello women had attended Kerry and Lara's wedding. At this point the stage it set for tragedy, leading, subsequently, to a round of Machiavellian intrigue, which would make Robespierre proud.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Balance of Power is a long complicated book of 605 pages. It is both heart wrenching and inspiring. During the inspiring parts, I'm not ashamed to admit my eyes would water. If you pick up this book you are in for an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />This book would not appeal to gun advocates, since it depicts the gun lobby as unalterably set against even the most modest safety measures, even those volunteered by gun manufacturers. The author, Richard North Patterson, conceded to a gun control bias in the Acknowledgment section at the rear of the book, although that was obvious to me, from the tenor of the novel. In truth the book mirrors the intransigence that often emanates from the real life NRA, regarding seemingly innocuous legislation, in total disregard of the victims and survivors of gun violence.<br /><br />In summary, Balance of Power is an excellent tale of the exercise and misuse of power in lobbying and government which can make one seethe. The character development is superb, with distinct conniving antagonists you love to hate, contrasting with good and admirable protagonists. The situations that unfold are extremely interesting, such as a conundrum which existed between a lawsuit needed to thwart pending legislation, whose passage would terminate the lawsuit.<br /><br />The book is well written and the writing is fluid. There is, in myopinion, some superfluous verbiage though not overly so. Patterson's writing style, although sometimes technical, is still easily understood. He is one of the better authors I have read. I did have a problem with one element of the story, where they were submitting legislation that would kill all product liability against all manufacturers, passage of which, would wipe out pending and future lawsuits by employees of a company that had received fatal doses of asbestos in a mine. That didn't seem like product liability to me. Still Balance of Power is a fascinating read, that gives the reader a glimpse of the inner workings of congress and special interest groups.

Marshall Cartwright sells a pint of his 'type O negative' blood (sounds like a band name or something, doesn't it?) to a blood bank for a fifty dollar bounty. Later, his blood is given to a dying eighty year old billionaire, Leroy Weaver, who not only miraculously makes a full recovery but loses years in a matter of hours until he appears to be in his twenties. Much to everybody's chagrin the change is temporary and Weaver is back to his original state in forty days (enough time for the donated blood to wash out of the body). Weaver's doctor, Dr. Russell Pearce, figures out what happened and traced the blood back to the transient Cartwright, whom he figures out to be immortal.<br /><br />Thus begins the greatest manhunt in the history of the world. A foundation is set up by the world's wealthiest and most influential elders, lasting almost a century, whose main task is to track down Cartwright and or his descendants, with a secondary purpose of funding research for the synthesis of Cartwright's blood globulin.<br /><br />The Immortals was written in the fifties and has been updated with the twenty-first century technology. The story covers a period in excess of a hundred years in five parts. It sometimes seems disjointed and that may be because the book is an assemblage of related short stories that the author, James, over fifty years ago.<br /><br />Overall I found the book a little hard to follow, especially Part IV \\"The Medic\\" which was fairly confusing at first. The novel purports a future in which the medical establishment effectively takes over the economy of the world, sometimes in direct conflict with established and renegade governments. With each succeeding part, the world degenerates more into a Mad Max style anarchy, with roving gangs and marauders, street wise poor, fortified estates for the elite and local governments, (sometimes the same thing) and lastly the Citadel like Hospitals, sometimes covering several square miles in area, usually within the most dangerous urban areas.<br /><br />There are some even more gruesome parts like when someone defaults on a prohibitively expensive Health Contract, they are taken into custody and put on life support and kept alive in a harvesting warehouse, where their bodies are harvested for body parts. Also, their seems to be two types of roving gangs - head hunters which kill and take heads for a bounty or body snatchers, (my term) where they capture humans alive to use for body parts for an even larger bounty.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This book certainly paints a dreary picture for the future. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the inspiration for doomsday movies like the aforementioned Mad Max/Road Warrior, A boy and his Dog, The Postman and Waterworld.<br /><br />We never get to meet the Immortal Marshall Cartwright but we do get to meet three of his female descendants. The protagonist of the story seems to be Dr. Russell Pearce, who keeps popping up throughout the book. I like the fact that the book was updated and had things like DNA and computers that weren't really around in 1955.<br /><br />The book consists of 301 pages of fairly large type of which I estimate less than eighty thousand words, so it is a pretty quick read. I picked up this book because it was written by James Gunn who had also authored one of my favorite sci-fi books \\"The Joy Makers\\". I don't think \\"The Immortals\\" compares that well with \\"The Joy Makers\\" but it does have some very interesting aspects and is well worth a quick read, despite some confusing parts.<br /><br />Final rating 3.6 starsand lastly the Citadel like Hospitals, sometimes covering several square miles in area, usually within the most dangerous urban areas. <br /> <br />There are some even more gruesome parts like when someone defaults on a prohibitively expensive Health Contract, they are taken into custody and put on life support and kept alive in a harvesting warehouse, where their bodies are harvested for body parts.

Of course being on the plus side of middle age may be part of the reason.<br /><br />Yes Belinda is beautiful and young and exciting and young and charming and young and shapely and did I mention young. Jeremy Walker is a famous, middle age author of children's books and a painter, who illustrates his own books. But after he runs into Belinda he can't write anything. All he can do is work on paintings of Belinda. He is in fact obsessed with painting her without clothes.<br /><br />The book starts with Jeremy observing Belinda at a book signing in a San Francisco book store and he is smitten. He has to meet her so he asks her to a publisher's party afterward. She not only accompanies him but she seduces him at the party. No doubt about it, he is a fish on the hook, trashing around on the deck. On the other hand Belinda is both secretive, uninhibited and affectionate. Eventually Belinda agrees to move in with Jeremy.<br /><br />Understandably, Jeremy is very curious about Belinda's past and her family but Belinda will not discuss it. In fact, she issues an ultimatum that she will leave for good if he keeps questioning her. Jeremy keeps painting her in various nude poses and tells Belinda not to worry, no one will ever see them. Like Belinda is worried. She thinks he ought to have an exhibition.<br /><br />Jeremy is not about to stop inquiring about Belinda. He's just going to be more discreet about it, so he tells his good friend and Attorney Dan the story and asks him to surreptitiously make inquiries. Dan is incredulous and tells Jeremy what he already knows. That if his affair became public, he would at least be finished as a writer of children's or any other kind of books and maybe even serve time for statuary rape, where he would get to experience forcible rape firsthand. He also queries another good friend, Alex, a famous movie star.<br /><br />Little by little a picture emerges about Belinda and people are indeed looking for Belinda and the more he finds out about them, the more they find out about him, whereas this involved story gets even more involved.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Is Belinda pornographic? No, it really is a love story. Really! Ok, so it has some erotic sequences and I suppose it resembles an old man's fantasy where a rich older man takes up with a beautiful young girl but it's also real life where rich older men divorce their long time wives for young blood trophy wives. It's not exactly uncommon.<br /><br />Jeremy seems to have a childish innocence about him, while Belinda is worldly beyond her years. Jeremy is a bachelor, who happens to be a nice man and Belinda sincerely likes him for it. She has had plenty of duplicity and uncaring in her childhood and she is ready for stability.<br /><br />Belinda is four hundred fifty-two pages long and was well written as any of you familiar with Anne Rice/Rampling might expect. While some of her writing tends to be morbid or even bloody, there was none of that in Belinda. The sexuality that appears was in keeping with the theme of the story and tastefully done. This novel was told in three longer parts and the final shorter part. While the writing was flowing, the story was not too wordy. Descriptions were kept to a minimum and used only to enhance the story.

The Machine Crusade is the middle installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert. For those of you that don't know, The Machine Crusade takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herbert's immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son) and Kevin Anderson. It is the fourth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I found this trilogy to be exceptional. I believe they may be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscripts. I finally got to experience the distant past, which was vaguely alluded to in Herbert's original Dune series. We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak.<br /><br />As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are every bit as advanced to us, as we are to Cro Magnon Man.<br /><br />I found this book, consisting of 695 pages, to be an riveting read.

Yes I'm sure, there must be plenty exceptions to the brutality and inhumanity that is outlined in these books and the stories that are depicted are most likely, the worst cases the authors came across but what comes through with disturbing clarity, is a systemic, religious, abusive, misogynistic undercurrent against all women of Islam, which varies in intensity from country to country (infidel women don't even count).<br /><br />Nine Parts of Desire is written by prizewinning Wall Street Journal correspondent, Geraldine Brooks and is based upon her experiences during the seven years she was stationed in the Middle East. She gets the title for her book from an old Muslim proverb \\"God created sexual desire in ten parts; then he gave nine parts to women and one to men.\\"<br /><br />Brooks does try to provide a more balanced view of Islam than previous authors have presented, however the bottom line remains the same - that Muslim women, in most Muslim countries, live at the whim and total dependence of their husbands or their male relatives. Brooks tries to explain and I do believe her, that this untenable situation is not sanctioned by the Muslim Holy book, the Quran. In fact she maintains that the Quran and Hadiths (sayings of the Prophet) of Islam's original message actually gave women sweeping rights that were unheard of in the Seventh Century. These rights included the right of inheritance and the right of divorce.<br /><br />Brooks claims that the rights of women started to erode early on as Islamic armies spread the word of the one true God in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries, by borrowing and adopting those anti-woman customs to which they were exposed. Islam adopted the royal Persian custom of veils, accepted gender mutilation from Egypt and when it found societies in which women had little or no voice in public affairs, its own traditions of lively women's participation withered. Women in the time of Muhammad rode camels and horses, ran businesses and even fought with the armies, yet woman of today are generally timid, fearful and backward, especially in the less progressive countries or the more primitive areas of large progressive countries.<br /><br />Nine Parts of Desire tends to concentrate on those countries where the author spent the most time and had Muslim women friends, namely Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Lebanon and even Palestine.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Nine Parts of Desire is a laconic, well written book of 289 pages. Though it is a relatively short book, Brooks manages to disseminate a torrent of information. There is also a useful glossary of Arabic terms in the back as well.<br /><br />Though Brooks does not make excuses for the troubling situation Muslim women find themselves, she does point out that those who condemn these practices in the West, tend to overlook parallel though less overt treatment of women around the world, including in the West. I agree that there are wife beatings, even killings in America but at least it is against the law. A woman could be stoned to death in Saudi Arabia if she has been found to have had sex out of wedlock. This requires testimony of four male witnesses, who in one case, I read about in another book, were the girl's accusers but were in realitly her rapists. Brooks on one hand show how Muslim women are discriminated against but also points out that many women claim to like their present status and point out the advantages of being anonymously cloaked. These tend to be older women who are afraid of change.<br /><br />A by product of Brook's writing, though most likely inadvertently was the appearance that Islamic society appears to be grossly inefficient. Prohibitions against the full integration of women in most of these countries make some of the simplest tasks virtual impossibilities. As an example she tells of a surveyorsinability to conduct a poll in Saudi Arabia for laundry detergent. Saudi women are forbidden from talking to males outside of the family and females if allowed to work at all are restricted to jobs such as medicine or teaching.<br /><br />I think Nine Parts of Desire would be a good place to start for any reader that is interested in getting a balanced view of how women of Islam fair in various countries and the outlook for more liberal women's rights.<br /><br />Final Rating 3.9 Starss of a surveyors inability to conduct a poll in Saudi Arabia for laundry detergent.

US	38622886	RSFC5U3063RS0	0743287150	247431684	The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat	Books	3	3	5	N	N	The Rest of the Story	Bob Woodward is finally filling in the gaps in the Deep Throat Mystery, which frankly ain't much. The revelations put forth in his new book, The Secret Man are surprisingly meager. To say that The Secret Man is laconic is like saying Phoenix is somewhat warm. For one of the biggest secrets of our times, Woodward had surprisingly little to say. The book is short! Short on information. Short on revelations. Short on words (about 40,00 I`d guess). Short on interest. Short, Short, Short. That`s not to say the book is totally without merit. Woodward continues to write in his `aw shucks`, `down home' style of writing and he does manage to give Deep Throat a face. A face of a kindly old befuddled gentleman now and the proud, confident, mildly ruthless, extremely secretive informer of the seventies.<br /><br />Much to the authors chagrin he was unable to ascertain Felt`s true motive`s behind his secretive revelations before his dementia and we are subjected to his rehashing of all that has been said by his contemporaries in the past. However, we do get to see a side of Woodard that I had never suspected. That of a pushy, prodding, sometimes demanding but not ungrateful recipient of Felt's largess. As Woodward recites the events, it seems that Felt, whatever his motives, be it personal, or resentment of the Nixon team for compromising his beloved FBI, was recalcitrant and events would not have moved forward, without Woodward's persistence. This ultimately led to a split of these unlikely friends where Felt wouldn`t take Woodward`s calls and they did not talk for a period of some twenty years.<br /><br />My feeling is that although Woodward had his book ready to go in draft form, he was taken by surprise by the sudden surprise announcement from Felt's family and was rushed to come up with the finished manuscript. As short as the book is, it seems it was stretched by repeating things in the last third of the book. I found this repetition annoying. In summary I found the book mildly amusing and I`m glad I read it, if for nothing else, to get a feeling for the man they called Deep Throat. Was he a hero or a traitor? My sense is that Nixon and his gang were out of control and Ship of State was dangerously listing and Felt with some help from Woodward and Bernstein were to only ones bailing the water at first. Yeah he was a hero. Wish we had some of his ilk today. He wasn't obsequious. Nor was he a sycophant. He would have never said `Mr. President, it's a slam dunk'.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the book. I feel like the book was rushed for obvious reasons. The story, what there is of if is compelling but seems incomplete. I give it a rating of 3.2 Stars.book mildly amusing and I`m glad I read it, if for nothing else, to get a feeling for the man they called Deep Throat. Was he a hero or a traitor?

US	38622886	RFCQG2ZHYMF2O	0312335776	531903213	Fade	Books	5	19	22	N	Y	Kyle Mills is on a Roll !	After a brilliant debut novel, Kyle Mlls wrote three or four good but not great books. Not so for his last two. These are page turners deluxe. Three weeks ago I read and reviewed his tongue and cheek novel about big tobacco, called Smoke Screen and was extremely impressed. Now I've just finished his latest book, \\"Fade\\" and I am again impressed.<br /><br />The title \\"Fade\\" is the name of the protagonist - Salem al Fayad, Fade for short - an ex CIA killing machine. Fade is a born and raised in the US, Christian Arab, who after being operational in the Middle East in the late nineties, found himself seriously wounded - a bullet near the spine - which threatened to paralyze him. There was an experimental operation which could remove the bullet and the danger but his friend and handler Matt Egan was unable to get anyone to pay for it.<br /><br />Fast forward to present day; Matt is now working for Homeland Security and he and his boss, Hillel Strand have been tasked with setting up an overseas ongoing Middle Eastern operation and while reviewing the files of possible candidates, Matt's boss, to Matt's chagrin zeros in on Salem al Fayad, deciding he would be the perfect recruit. Matt tries to dissuade Strand but he is unyielding and insists on a visit to meet his new would be recruit.<br /><br />Fade (Salem al Fayad) is bitter about his previous shoddy treatment by his country. When the government wouldn't pay for his operation, he went to work for a Columbian drug lord, in Columbia, helping him eliminate some of his competition, in order to raise enough money for the operation but alas, when he finally amassed the needed amount, it was too late as scar tissue, congregating around the bullet made the operation impossible. So when his old friend Matt and the imperious Hillel Strand showed up trying to enlist his services, they were sent packing in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />Hillel Strand was not used to not getting his way, so he arranged for Fade to be arrested on some phony murder charge, wherein he would clear Fade, thereby making him indebted but as if in response to Murphy's Law, the worst case scenario ensues, putting Fade on the run and Strand hiding out from Fade, who now has promised to kill him. (This is the one weakness I found in the story - The sheriff sending out a SWAT team in the middle of the night to arrest a man on an anonymous phone tip)<br /><br />Even though \\"Fade\\" is only 311 pages long, Kyle Mills manages to give the reader a good feel for his characters. Both Egan and Fade are likable as is Karen Manning, who enters the story as the head of a SWAT team sent to arrest Fade. The villain, of course, is the self important Hillel Strand, with runner-up honors to Manning's boss, Sheriff Pickering. Egan is put in the middle of the battle between Fade and Strand and you don't know which way he will jump.<br /><br />As with Mill's previous six books the narrative is strong, smooth and fluid, without being wordy. As mentioned the book is only 311 pages and that is because he doesn't drag the reader into loquacious dialogue or go off in unnecessary directions. Instead he seems to reel the reader in by increasing the suspense on a chapter by chapter basis, in which the reader finds it difficult to take a break.<br /><br />I'm further impressed that Mills seems to have an unending array of divergent plots. This is his seventh book and while some best selling writers seem to rehash different versions of the same plot, like Harlan Coben, Mills has not repeated any characters, nor has any of his wildly diverse plots have any similarities. So far, when you pick up a book by Mills, you are reading a fresh, new and well written story. Expect Kyle Mills to make the NY Times bestseller list in the future and eventually become a mainstay.ested on some phony murder charge, wherein he would clear Fade, thereby making him indebted but as if in response to Murphy's Law, the worst case scenario ensues, putting Fade on the run and Strand hiding out from Fade, who now has promised to kill him.

US	38622886	RYO81LJ15X4ES	0316734942	60378634	The Closers	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Yet another engrossing Michael Connelly Read	When It come to mysteries, murder of otherwise, I don't know of anyone I can count on for a great read more than Michael Connelly and his new novel The Closers is no exception. How does his new novel compare with his previous gems? I don't know, it's hard to say, they're all good but I will say this, I never read one of his books faster. I put The Closers down once in a twenty-four hour period.<br /><br />The Closers is Connelly's eleventh Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch novel and his fifteenth overall. Cold cases seem to be popular now, so Connelly gets into the Cold Case act with Bosch who after a three year absence, retirement actually, returns to the LA police force and is assigned to their O.U. (Open-Unsolved) Task Force, where he's teamed up with his old partner Kiz Rider.<br /><br />Their first case is the abduction, right out of her bedroom and subsequent cold blooded murder of a sixteen year old girl, seventeen years ago. Finally after seventeen years, a sample of DNA (which wasn`t available at the time of the crime) was processed from the murder weapon and there was a match. Unfortunately the DNA was tied only to the weapon and not the girl, plus it appeared that more than one person may have participated, which led Bosch and Rider to try to set a trap but in the meantime exhaustive perusal of the murder book and interviews of witnesses etc. indicated that there may have been malfeasance committed by some of the police that were involved and the murder may have even been a hate crime, since the victim was half black.<br /><br />Old department enemies seem to be keeping an eye on this case and giving Bosch trouble as he goes but he will not be deterred and leaves no stone unturned as he is driven to solve this long-term cold case, that has ruined more than one life.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />If you've never read a book by Michael Connelly, I strongly recommend him. I have read all of his books and he is excellent. My favorite happens to be Angel Flight but any book by him will do.<br /><br />Connelly writes in a manner that always make sense and is easy to read. He never comes up with stories that you would find unbelievable and yet they are immensely interesting. He must do a lot of research, for it shows in his writing. I realize he used to be a crime reporter but still his knowledge of police procedures and jingo is impressive. Some may think of his character development as weak but in this book at least, there is no reason to get to know any but the main characters. Even so, beside rooting solidly for Bosch and Rider, the reader will find himself empathizing with the mother and father for the great loss they have sustained, both of whom have not, even after seventeen years, been able to pick up the pieces of their lives. You are also able to experience the tension between Bosch and Irvin Irving, his old nemesis and former Chief. In short the character development is directed where it enhances the story and no more. Connelly's writing tends to be laconic and to the point. no flowery descriptions, no filler. Even so this book is still four hundred pages.ngel Flight but any book by him will do.  <br /> <br />Connelly writes in a manner that always make sense and is easy to read.

Today we will be reviewing a book by Kyle Mills called Smoke Screen. which is Mill's sixth book and whereas his previous books were all mystery thrillers, this one shoots off in a new direction.\\"<br /><br />\\"With us this fine Saturday morning our usual panel members ET and Pamela Anderson. Et of course is our resident Science Fiction expert and Pamela doesn't know that much about books but she sure is nice to look at, right ET. Gimme three! That a boy! The gentleman in the middle is ET's long time interpreter Hailey Comet and last but not least is our two guest panel members, Film Maker, Michael Moore and Comedian Jerry Seinfield and Mike, please don't worry about that chair, I of course am your host, William Jefferson Clinton. I used to work for the government but now I've got a real job and I'm loving it.\\"<br /><br />\\"As usual I'll read the fly leaf of the book, giving everybody a feeling for the book Then we'll have our usual comment from our Mr. D and then we'll open up for discussion by our panel. Sorry ET, this one isn't Sci-Fi but it is a good book, right? You haven`t read it yet? You`ll read it on the commercial break.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gee, I wish I could read that fast. It took me a week solid to read this one\\"<br /><br />\\"Well baby you know you don`t have to contribute. You just have to sit there like you do, doing your thing.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know Billy boy but I want to contribute for a change.\\"<br /><br />\\"Okay, let's move on. Here's what the fly leaf has to say.\\"<br /><br />\\"Through an inexplicable series of unwanted promotions, Trevor Barnett has become the lead spokesman for the tobacco industry just as it's on the verge of extinction. Plaintiffs' attorneys have finally found the weakness they've been searching for and filed a $200 billion lawsuit that the industry will be unable to appeal.\\"<br /><br />\\"America's tobacco companies react by doing the unthinkable - they close their plants and recall their products from retailers' shelves. Trevor is charged with the task of going on national television and making the announcement: Not another cigarette will be manufactured of sold until the industry is given ironclad protection from the courts.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's more but I think the audience gets the idea. We now have Mr. D on the phone to get his analysis. Good morning Mr. D. May get right to the point, what did you think of Smoke Screen?\\"<br /><br />\\"Well Bill, I really loved it. Up until this book, Kyle Mills has been a serious novelist but on his latest novel, Smoke Screen he has borrowed from the masters of tongue in cheek humor to put out a subtlety droll and amusingly clever book. He succinctly tells an excellent, witty story, doesn`t get too detail oriented doesn`t try to foist his superior vocabulary on the reader, so you don`t need a dictionary next to you\\"<br /><br />\\"What I like about Kyle Mill`s books, which I like at varying degrees, is that he comes up with some seriously different and interesting plots. He`s not the only one that can do that, of course but it seems like some major authors rehash the same plots only on a more massive scale.\\"<br /><br />\\"I read a bio on this guy and he don't even have a background in writing, he just tried it, managed with difficulty to get his first book published and now he's off and running. I'm impressed and I`m impressed with his writing as well. He doesn`t waste words. His writing is direct, he doesn`t meander off in other directions and he`s smooth. This book is less than 350 pages, when 500 plus is the apparent norm.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks again Mr D for your insights. so what do you rate rate this book?\\"<br /><br />\\"Sorry Bill, I thought that was obvious - Five big ones!\\"<br /><br />\\"Super. We`ll take a break now and when we come back we`ll hear what our panel has to say\\"<br /><br />_______________<br /><br />\\"Ok Panel, let's talk about Smoke Screen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes Pamela.\\"<br /><br />\\"I loved it, it was humorous and droll and clever and ah..............oh yeah succinct and I give it five stars.\\"<br /><br />\\"Hmmmm, ok ET, how did you see it\\"<br /><br />\\"Mr ET thought it was very good but he would like to have seen some sex scenes and for it to take place in space but he still gave it five stars\\"<br /><br />\\"I see, sex scenes huh, I thought you guys were unisex, oh well Mike what did you think?

US	38622886	RE6MQWD38UXEC	0316710598	224255669	London Bridges (Alex Cross Novel)	Books	2	2	2	N	Y	A Comic Book Novel Without Pictures	How can somebody write such a good book one time and such mediocre trumpery the next? C'mon James Patterson, You can do better, you wrote Kiss the Girls and Jack and Jill both great novels. Then again, you've wrote some bombs too. I won't say London Bridges is your biggest bomb but I will say it's your biggest Alex Cross stinker.<br /><br />London Bridges incongruously starts out with a Russian master criminal, known as the Wolf, hiring a psychotic serial killer, thought to be dead, called the Weasel after first capturing and torturing him.<br /><br />A few days later a small central Nevada mining town is obliterated. At this time FBI analyst Dr. Alex Cross is brought into the investigation. Some how a video surfaces which catches the Weasel filming the prelude to the disaster, showing dozens of apparent Army troops herding the three hundred residents into buses and evacuating them before a huge bomb is dropped destroying the town.<br /><br />Alex Cross is stupefied on discovering the Weasel is still alive. A few days later a small town in Scotland is annihilated but this time the residents are not vacated. Investigators are again clueless as to who is doing these things and the purpose for this destruction.<br /><br />The Wolf's plan is to extort a couple billion dollars and freedom for specified political prisoners and he makes his demands by phone to the assembled top law enforcement officials in the government. Seventy-two hours to meet his demands or he would, destroy New York, Washington, London and Frankfort if his demands are not met. Once the Wolf makes his demands known, Cross realizes that the Weasel is working for The Wolf and he finds the idea of these two psychopathic criminals teaming up, chilling.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I'm sure many James Patterson fans found this book enthralling but as a part time fan I thought the story was silly and the way it was written unusual. There isn't anything glaring that I can point to but I had the feeling this story could easily be a comic book story. Ultra bad bigger than life heavies, playing around with Cross and always three steps ahead of the authorities. Written in a jerky style consisting of 124 chapters in 326 pages, the story kept you turning the pages but left you wondering \\"where`s the beef?\\" The longest chapter was probably four pages and this also contributed to the comic book effect.<br /><br />The story itself was so outlandish as to become incongruous. The Wolf was ostensibly a cold war Russian defector whom our government, incredulously had no record of or pictures of. Patterson tried unsuccessfully to explain how this could happen, which is something he managed to do throughout the book, like how the elusive Weasel after having Cross running around in circles confronts him, so Cross can kill him. Another thing that bothered me was the Wolf kept giving everybody extensions. I didn`t think really BAD guys gave extensions. True he blew up a couple bridges (hence the title).killing dozens of innocents to make his point but really, The Wolf at that point lost his evil persona.<br /><br />Patterson finally managed to surprise me with the ending but no, that's not the end. He had to screw it up by confusing the issue, reminding me of one of those corny movie scenes where the good guy kills the bad guy only to have him come back again and maybe again.<br /><br />Hard core James Patterson fans may enjoy this one but for the rest of you I wouldn't think so.had the feeling this story could easily be a comic book story.

US	38622886	R2B1S61L7OUN9U	0143035649	175716734	AN Agent in Place	Books	3	9	10	N	N	A Cold War Love/Spy Thriller	Set in the Former Soviet Union in the late 1980s, this novel by spy master Robert Littell is about an unauthorized operation hatched by a leftover surreptitious rogue agency (Intelligence Support Activity)in Washington, aimed at destabilizing \\"glasnost and perestroika\\" and the associated reforms, then taking place in the Soviet Union.<br /><br />When Ben Bassett, ostensibly a low level bureaucrat arrives at the US Embassy in Moscow, the KGB takes little notice, at least at first. However, when their eavesdroppers figure out that he has met with the CIA station chief and is working out of the CIA section, they inform their superior, Viktor Prosenko, who takes a renewed interest in the inscrutable Bassett.<br /><br />Aida Zavaskaya is a poet, a mother and a women's rights activist. She eeks out an existence by getting her sometimes erotic poetry published here and there. Only one of her books has made it past the censors to publication. She is proud, attractive, even with her badly set broken nose, courtesy of the KGB, and she is a celebrity of sorts to Russian women. She augments her meager earnings by occasionally reading her poetry for gatherings of women.<br /><br />They meet by chance and though Aida is hesitant, Bassett persists. Bassett is charming, Aida is charming and soon they are involved and so to is the KGB. Aida's thirteen year old son has a rare type of leukemia that can be held in permanent remission by a certain American drug. The KGB cuts off Aida's supply of this drug to force Bassett's co-operation and little by little Bassett starts giving in to them and supplying what they want.<br /><br />An Agent in Place, is both a love story and a spy thriller. Bassett falls for Aida and she for him. He wants to take her and the boy to America but Aida insists she loves her country and could never fit in elsewhere. Eventually when Bassett supplies Viktor with everything he wants and needs, he tries to kill Bassett and then He and Aida and the boy and with the aid of Manny Custer, the Embassy Director of Security, are on the run.<br /><br />Robert Littell is a former Journalist for Newsweek, so he knows how to write. The grimness and hopelessness of Moscow is palatable. He takes the time to develop the main characters and their backgrounds. He makes you feel the cruelness and inhumanity of the KGB personnel. He also develops interesting side characters as well. In a twist of fate, Aida's \\"future ex husband\\", Vadim, a wealthy Jewish entrepreneur is sleeping with The KGB Colonel Viktor's wife. Viktor is many years older than his wife and had agreed to an open marriage and so he can't or won't do anything about it. As I read on I grew to appreciate Vadim's dependability and sense of humor.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />An Agent in Place is a interesting book. I would not give it a particularly high rating but I enjoyed it and I'm glad I read it. Littell's writing style is succinct and descriptive and I found his subject matter, here at least, interesting. I'm afraid I must say that I did think the story was a little predictable. I also refuse to believe the KGB would try to kill a turned agent established inside the American Embassy. I'm sure they could come up with some other way to insure his silence and keep getting information from him.<br /><br />At the time Littell wrote this book he had nine other books under his belt. I consider him a good writer and would not hesitate to read further books by him. Rating 3.5 starsand with the aid of Manny Custer, the Embassy Director of Security, are on the run.  <br /> <br />Robert Littell is a former Journalist for Newsweek, so he knows how to write. The grimness and hopelessness of Moscow is palatable. He takes the time to develop the main characters and their backgrounds. He makes you feel the cruelness and inhumanity of the KGB personnel. He also develops interesting side characters as well. In a twist of fate, Aida's \\"future ex husband\\", Vadim, a wealthy Jewish entrepreneur is sleeping with The KGB Colonel Viktor's wife. Viktor is many years older than his wife and had agreed to an open marriage and so he can't or won't do anything about it. As I read on I grew to appreciate Vadim's dependability and sense of humor.  <br /> <br />CONCLUSION  <br /> <br />An Agent in Place is a interesting book. I would not give it a particularly high rating but I enjoyed it and I'm glad I read it. Littell's writing style is succinct and descriptive and I found his subject matter, here at least, interesting.

Your mind is jumbled up and you don't know what you want to do so you start traveling around the country. You hitchhike or ride the bus when you can and walk otherwise. You camp out in the woods and live off the land as you are trained to do.<br /><br />You are a law abiding citizen. You love your country, you fought for your country, and you've KILLED for your country. You are a trained killing machine, a weapon of mass destruction, sprung tight and ready to go off with provocation and provoke you they do. In town after town you have been rousted, not because of anything you've done but because of your scruffy appearance.<br /><br />John Rambo is passing through Madison, Kentucky and decides to get a hamburger but as usual it's not that simple. Chief of Police, Wilfred Teasle has other ideas. He doesn't want any riffraff in his town so he picks the kid up and drives him to the edge of town, He wasn't particularly nasty about it, in fact he tried to be pleasant, determined but pleasant, but he wasn't so pleasant later when he found the kid in the local diner. He told the waitress to put the kid's order in a bag and hustled him back out of town. By now Teasle was very annoyed, so he went and parked on a side street and kept watch to make sure the kid did not walk back into town.<br /><br />For his part the kid (Rambo) had reached his limit. If someone was going to push him, he was going to push back. He was determined to go back and confront the Chief and make him back down but of course Teasle had other ideas. He arrested the kid, took him to jail, hosed him down and started to give him a haircut and a shave.<br /><br />Now, Rambo was an escaped POW. He was a prisoner of the North Vietnamese and was tortured relentlessly before escaping, so when the deputies tried to shave him with a straight razor, he flipped out and grabbed the razor and slashed a deputy that reached for his gun.<br /><br />Thus began an odyssey of death and mayhem in the nearby mountains and eventually destroyed a good part of Madison.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Most of you are probably aware that a movie was made from this book. Because of this I need to make comparisons to the movie.<br /><br />The Book<br /><br />This was David Morrell's first book and for a first book it showed phenomenal presence. The book was a pleasure to read. Morrell used easy to understand language and the novel moved right along smoothly. It contains cover to cover action and there's never a dull moment, literally the story seemed to jump out at you.<br /><br />The macho macho plot seems to revolve around saving some perceived face. Teasle thinks if he backs down he would be setting a precedent and his little town would soon be inundated with drugs and undesirables, a ridiculous notion. On the other hand Rambo probably could have avoided confrontation if he'd have been forthcoming about his service, status and his medal. Instead he was close lipped and brought the confrontation to a head. At first you seem to pull for Rambo as being unjustly persecuted but ultimately he proves to be an out of control trained killer who is in a preservation mode - exactly as he was trained.<br /><br />The Movie<br /><br />In short the book was excellent but it was much more violent than the movie, which I'd seen first, so I felt it was much more violent than it needed to be. For example in the movie only one deputy gets killed almost accidentally and the viewer felt he deserved it.<br /><br />In the book, Rambo was determined to kill everyone who came after him including the bloodhounds and he was good at his job. In the movie Rambo was not quite as psychotic and because of this you empathized with him as the underdog. I guess I feel that the book was great but honestly, I enjoyed the movie more.the razor and slashed a deputy that reached for his gun.  <br /> <br />Thus began an odyssey of death and mayhem in the nearby mountains and eventually destroyed a good part of Madison.  <br /> <br />CONCLUSION  <br /> <br />Most of you are probably aware that a movie was made from this book.

US	38622886	R245QW4YXOSX9U	0553804146	245113934	Life Expectancy: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Another captivating read from Dean Koontz	Dean Koontz is a very prolific writer. By that I mean he grinds out a lot of books but as he grinds out new titles his writing has been changing (evolving?). I'm not saying it's bad, far from it. It's just that when Koontz started out, he used to write very good books, strictly in the Horror genre and for the last few years has been writing in what I would call bizarre, humorous, suspense.<br /><br />Take Life Expectancy. Along with about the last four Koontz novels I have read, he works overtime to develop an endearing character or two and a lots of playfully jocular remarks, in a background of a dangerously weird situations. In Odd Thomas it was of course the enigmatic Odd Thomas. In The Face (a mega rich movie star), it was the Face's son Fric and to a lesser extent Ethan Truman. In One Door Away from Heaven it was the irrepressibly, spunky, handicapped Leilani Klonk. In Life Expectancy it's the equally spunky and beautiful Lorrie Lynn Hicks and to a lesser extent our protagonist Jimmy Tock.<br /><br />Life Expectancy<br /><br />I don't know if Koontz planned it that way but the spirited, incisive and spontaneous lass that he created, Lorrie Lynn Hicks, stole the show from the main character, Jimmy Tock but I'm getting ahead of myself<br /><br />Jimmy Tock was born to some most unusual circumstances and an even stranger legacy. On the night he was born, Jimmy's grandfather, who was in a stroke induced coma, suddenly awoke and predicted, among other things, five \\"terrible days\\" for his grandson, between his twentieth and thirtieth birthdays and then dies as Jimmy is born. In the meantime, as Jimmy is only minutes old, tragedy befalls the hospital as a man whose wife dies in childbirth goes berserk, kills the doctor and a nurse, grabs his newly born son and rushes into the night. As it turns out the events of that night and the legacy of terrible days are intertwined and do come back to haunt him five times.<br /><br />Jimmy belongs to a family of pastry chefs. The Tock's have been Pastry Chefs for generations and Jimmy is being groomed to follow in his father's footsteps. He has started out as a baker, where his father Rudy works. His family is close and tight knit and all are concerned as his first \\"terrible day\\" approaches. And so when the date of the first \\"terrible day\\" arrives Jimmy decides that not knowing what is coming and realizing that he must survive this day in order to have four more terrible days, goes out into the world as if it was a normal day to meet his destiny and the love of his life, the inimitable, Lorrie Lynn Hicks.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I have read some Koontz books that grab you from the first chapter, while others take their time to wrap their tentacles around your mind. Life Expectancy is one of the former. With the extraordinary drama that takes place in the first chapter and the knowledge, generally about how the story will proceed, it would take a major act of will power to set the book aside after the first twenty-five or so pages.<br /><br />I must admit, once I got into this book, I found it to be an intriguing read as good as some of Koontz's best. Koontz did not meander too much on details as he did in previous novels and the writing was smooth and clever. Koontz still seems to be perfecting a humorous side, as the banter between Jimmy and Lorrie Lynn Hicks, had me chucking on occasion.<br /><br />The character development in this book was marvelous. You really got to know and love Lorrie and Jimmy and felt attached to his family including Jimmy's Granny, who was definitely off the wall. The bad guys were clowns. No, not figuratively, really, they were clowns. Bad clowns at that. How's that for a twist? There were a couple other unexpected twists as well which I dare not go into. It should also be noted that Koontz wrote most of this book in the first person, which made it easier to follow. The book, at four hundred pages, is concise and easily digested and for a change Koontz did not try to show off his impressive vocabulary and managed to hold his typical verbosity in check. I give Mr. Koontz kudos for this one. final rating 4.25 stars.d and for a change Koontz did not try to show off his impressive vocabulary and managed to hold his typical verbosity in check.

US	38622886	RJC0G12BF8D0U	B00005XFB7	849363389	The haunted stars	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	A Memorable SF Classic!	Many years ago when I was a teenager I strictly read science fiction novels, many by the well reputed giants of the craft, names like Heinlein, Asimov, Clark, Van Vogt and Simak. One very consistent SF writer that I always thought was as good but never got the recognition some of the others got was Edmond Hamilton.<br /><br />His book, The Haunted Stars has stayed with me through the years and so I picked up and read a used copy of it last month. First published in 1962, writing styles have morphed over the years and with the advent of the word processor, novels became longer but this 159 page novel still stands on it's own. This book was written during the cold war and it reflects a competition between those conflicting ideologies.<br /><br />America and the Soviet Union have both reached the moon, albeit in separate missions landing in different locations. Both are setting up bases for lunar exploration but American explorers stumble across a lunar space station which is intact but has been damaged by a space battle. There are no corpses, no weapons, no spaceships. The only thing they know is that the station is its age - thirty thousand years old! Older that the recorded history of mankind.<br /><br />The Americans see this discovery as a way to get a leg up on the Soviets. They create, as quickly as possible, an interstellar ship, by combining technology they find at the station with what they already know. Then they send a small crew on a mission to a portion of space that has been ascertained as the home solar system of those who built the Lunar Space Station.<br /><br />They know not, what they'll find when they get there, if they get there, but what they do find is certainly not what they expected.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The Haunted Stars is one of the few books that I have gone back and read, which was as good as I remember. In 1962, when Haunted Stars was written, The Lord of the Rings had recently been published and the Fantasy genre, which later seemed to decimate the sci-fi genre had yet to become established. Then science fiction meant science fiction and most sci-fi novels took place in space, or in the future.<br /><br />These were heady formative times for science fiction and some of the great science fiction of all time were penned in the fifties and sixties: Frank Herbert's masterpiece - Dune, Issac Asimov's classics - Foundation and Robot series, Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and many more. Of course everyone has read Arthur Clarke's 2001 Space Odyssey or seen the movie but he wrote a dozen good books before that 1968 publication including the classic - Childhoods End.<br /><br />I enjoy a good fantasy novel but it seems everybody is writing Fantasy now and hardly anyone is writing good science fiction anymore.<br /><br />Haunted Stars is a short concise novel of only 159 pages. It is a quick read but the characters, mostly out of necessity, are not well developed. This is something that have noticed in older books, which tended to be shorter. Either the story was shorter of there was much less detail. Of course now days we are spoiled since with the advent of word processors and computer a four hundred page book is now the norm instead of the rare exception. I have read three books by Edmund Hamilton and though the plots and stories are great, his writing is succinct and to the point, without much humor. This particular book which actually attempts to explore a possibility for the beginnings of the human race is a very well done captivating read which I heartily recommend.o become established.

Straying somewhat from his Wall Street roots, Stephen Frey ventures in the murder mystery genre and almost pulls it off.<br /><br />Augustus McKnight (don't call him Gus) is a tall personable attractive man in his late twenties or early thirties. He appears to be stuck in a dead end job as a salesman for a paper company but he has plans. He has been boning up on the stock market for the last six months and controls a small on line account.<br /><br />Augustus is married to his high school sweetheart, Melanie who is a knockout and can manipulate him through sex. She works in a law office in order to stay ahead of the bills and has even been working late into the night, recently, to make more money. She has been growing impatient with Augustus and feels he does not do enough to be successful.<br /><br />In a quirk of luck, Augustus runs into a $90,000 IPO (Initial Public Offering) windfall. He is so pumped after work that he goes on a binge and gets home after Melanie. He can't wait to tell Melanie the good news but before he can do that she admits to an affair with her boss and asks for a divorce.<br /><br />The next day he quits after his boss tries to shake him down for half stock market the profits. Later that night the police come to his home and tell him his wife has been brutally murdered.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />At two hundred and ninety pages, things move fast. Augustus is also in line for a million dollar life insurance policy so he decides to go into Day Trading with his new found wealth. An old buddy of his, Vincent Carlucci, takes a renewed interest in Augustus and sets him up with some investors and things are really starting to look rosy but there's a storm on the horizon.<br /><br />Everything in Augustus' life going back to high school and beyond has been a sham. Almost nothing is as it had seemed. Many of those closest to him including his father had participated in deceit or held secret lives. Augustus and some co-workers are almost killed by an insane day-trader and eventually the police begin to look at him for Melanie's murder.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This is the third book I've read by Stephen Frey. The previous books I had read were what could be termed Financial Thrillers but I was surprised to see that this book contained only a smidgen of financial background. Frey has a nice writing style, is easy to follow and doesn't go off on tangents . He tends to be succinct and has an economy with words that I appreciate, which helps hold his stories down to manageable levels. His character development is excellent for the main character but not as thorough on subordinate characters.<br /><br />The story itself was fairly well written considering this was his first venture into violent crime. There were enough surprises and twists to make things interesting but I thought the novel fell down with the timelines. I don't want to give too much of the story away so I really can't get into it but if you read the book, you'll probably see what I mean. I also felt that the investigation wasn't proceeding in a normal manner. This is part of the timeline I was talking about. When a woman is murdered, the husband is usually the number one suspect and yet weeks went by before they looked at Augustus and this despite a large insurance policy, her cheating and asking for a divorce and not really having an alibi. It is these problems and a couple others that induce me to give Day Trader a high three star ratingare almost killed by an insane day-trader and eventually the police begin to look at him for Melanie's murder.  <br /> <br />Conclusion  <br /> <br />This is the third book I've read by Stephen Frey.

First, the President's helicopter is shot down by two missiles on the way back from Camp David, killing four including the Secretary of State and putting President George H.W. Bush into a coma. Next eight or ten heavily armed terrorists break into the Capitol Building killing or wounding everything in sight in one bold suicide attempt, until they are finally suppressed. Then, acting President Dan Quayle, after viewing the damage at the Capitol Building, while giving a short press conference on the Capitol steps is apparently shot at. He isn't hit but the Attorney General is. But this was just a prelude. Things get so bad that the National Guard and Army is called in and then the riots start.<br /><br />It seemed to start when, in an effort to show that we were winning the War on Drugs, the United States extradited Columbian drug kingpin, Chano Aldana, for trial. Aldana, probably insane but a truly scary and evil individual man gave an interview to two Washington Post reporters saying in essence that he was Satan incarnate and that the streets of Washington were going to be awash in blood if he wasn't released.<br /><br />So begins a story of violence and terror in the streets of Washington that was written fifteen years ago but seems right at home in this age of terrorism and terrorist threats.<br /><br />I never read a book by Stephen Coonts where Navy Captain (in this book) Jake Grafton wasn't in and this is no exception. He, along with his sidekick Toad Tarkington is currently attached to a terrorism unit of the Pentagon, working directly for the Joint Chief of Staff. He and FBI agent Tom Hooper wind up trying to track down Henry Charon, a rancher/hunter/poacher/hunting guide/hit man from New Mexico. The main plot is interesting enough but Coonts adds some subplots involving Post reporter Jack Yocke, Aldana's lawyer Thanis Liarakos, attorney/fixer/lobbyist T. Jefferson Body, smarmy senator Cherry and last but not least, my favorite, undercover agent Harrison Ronald Ford, who was trying to get the goods on Washington's number one drug dealer Freeman McNally.<br /><br />If the main story was engrossing, Coonts' method of weaving these sub-plots made a good book great. Each sub-plot was separate but they all had a thread that tied them together. The story involving Ford was most compelling and almost took away from the main story.<br /><br />The Author<br /><br />I don't read many of Coonts' books even though he's an excellent writer because his subject matter is usually militarily oriented a genre I do not gravitate to but this book was the exception. Although the military is involved, it deals more with law enforcement and government..<br /><br />Coonts is really a talented writer. His writing is fluid and compelling. It's easy to follow and in the case of this book kept me turning them pages. His character development is just right, making you feel things with the characters but not going overboard. Of course repeat character Jake Grafton is Mr goody two shoes, almost too perfect with no vices and the perfect family but that's the way Coonts chooses to portray him. You could compare him to Clancy's Jack Ryan.<br /><br />Other characters in this book however are another matter. We have unethical to sociopath to truly evil behavior. Our assassin looks at his work as a game - the only thing worth living for. The drug dealers as you might expect are brutal. And of course there are frailties such as the irony of Aldana's attorney, Liarakos' position comes out, defending the number one drug dealer in the world while his wife is a crack addict.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When I first read this book, some ten years before September 11th I found it to be a well written, very interesting story containing three or four interesting subplots but there was no way I thought something this horrible could be perpetrated on the American people. Well things have changed and as I read this for the second time, I kept feeling similaritiesto the atrocities that were being committed in the book and what's going on in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. It's eerie.<br /><br />It seems to me that if we ever capture the likes of Osama bin Laden or Abu Musab al Zarqawi we certainly don't want to bring them to the United States. Better a bullet hole to their head and an unmarked grave.ond time, I kept feeling similarities to the atrocities that were being committed in the book and what's going on in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.

I don't know how many she has written but it must be a ton, for the last six months she has read dozens but there is one she hasn't read, Divine Evil. Oh, certainly she stared to devour Divine Evil but stopped about two chapters into the book and put it, unfinished on my nightstand, saying \\"it's more your kind of book\\". Yes that's right, she likes happy vanilla type books and I like a little more meat in my reading.<br /><br />Divine Evil is about an up and coming artist, sculptress actually, from the small country, probably fictitious, town of Emmitsboro, Maryland. The intermittent nightmares Claire Kimball has been having since she was eight have returned and it's interfering with her creativity. She begins to feel uncomfortable in New York, so she decides to go back to her childhood home and see if she can make a fresh start there in the old family home that her twin brother had previously been renting out.<br /><br />Even before she gets there strange things start happening. Sheriff Cameron (Cam) Rafferty is called to the local graveyard because someone has dug up and removed the hundred year old corpse of a child. Cam himself had recently returned from a stint as a Washington D.C. detective to take over the sheriff's duties after the twenty year veteran had quit and left town in a hurry.<br /><br />Cam and Claire knew each other from high school. They each had a tragedy in their childhood, both lost fathers to untimely accidents and they were attracted to each other. Claire resisted at first but eventually joined Cam in a romantic liaison. Things were progressing quite well romantically but peculiar things kept interfering in their courtship. A fifteen year old runaway disappears after last being seen near Emmitsboro and Cam's hateful step father is beaten to death so bad that almost every bone in his body is broken. In addition evidence of Satanism starts to appear such as a decapitated cat on Claire's rear porch and of course Claire's nightmare seems to depict a Satanic ritual. After that things that start to spin out of control and eventually put their lives in danger.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The problem I had with Devine Evil had nothing to do with Nora Roberts writing style. Having written about a million and a half books, she obviously knows how to write. Her writing is creative, slightly humorous and a little endearing. Her character development was good as you really got a feel for the main characters, especially Claire Kimball and Cameron Rafferty, although Claire seemed a little obtuse when it came to grasping events. No, the problem I had was with the subject matter.<br /><br />I haven't read anything else by Nora Roberts, though I did read one of her alter ego, J D Robb novels, and I don't think she has written any other Horror/Terror/Thrillers and it shows. If she did my wife wouldn't have read it. For me the plot was a little silly and the ending was easily anticipated. It wasn't so much how it would end but how would we get there.<br /><br />Divine Evil never really gets scary. In some respects it almost seems like the Keystone Cops practicing Devil worship. It's sort of like Happy Days meets I know What You Did Last Summer<br /><br />I would suggest to Ms. Roberts, that before she tackles any more books in this genre she should read a few by the masters, Stephen King, F. Paul Wilson and Dean Koontz among others. There is no comparison.ar porch and of course Claire's nightmare seems to depict a Satanic ritual.

The characters seemed weak and uninteresting and the obvious plot seemed tired. I was debating putting the book aside after a hundred pages but reconsidered because the author, Greg Iles, is one of my favorite dozen or so authors. In addition to several other fine books, he is the author of \\"The Quiet Game\\", one of my favorite books. So I decided to give Greg about fifty more pages.<br /><br />Well Greg didn't need fifty more pages, he only needed about five for what seemed to be a slow moving serial murder story was suddenly turned on it's head (figuratively) and transformed into a very serious story about child abuse and the wrecked lives in the wake of these tragedies.<br /><br />Blood Memory<br /><br />Our unlikely heroine is Catherine Ferry a self described alcoholic who has been on the wagon for two days because she has discovered that she is pregnant by her married boyfriend Detective Sean Regan of the New Orleans Police Dept.<br /><br />Though her private life is a disaster, Cat, as she likes to be called, is a well reputed forensic Odontologist - an expert on teeth and bitemarks. She got involved with Regan during a case the two were working on and have been carrying on an affair for eighteen months.<br /><br />In addition to the obvious percs of having a mistress, Detective Regan has worked closely with Cat on several investigations and her insights have allowed Regan to close several high profile cases, thus Regan,s star is in ascent. However it is about to change direction.<br /><br />A serial killer is killing middle aged to elderly men, five so far and Regan is on the task force. The victims, in addition to being shot in the spine and the head have also been bitten and so Cat has been to each crime scene. Since there have been multiple murders, the FBI is also involved and they are headed by one of their successful profilers named John Kaiser.<br /><br />Something is happening to Cat. At the forth crime scene, she got agitated then dizzy and started regurgitating. At this crime scene she fainted and Regan's boss Captain Carmen Piazza sends her home and tells Detective Regan to be in her office in the morning intimating knowlege about the affair.<br /><br />\\"What is wrong\\" Cat wonders, \\"could it be because she's pregnant?\\" (She hasn`t told Regan yet) She wants a drink bad but she resists. She has traded alcohol for Valium, takes one and decides to head home, up the river to Natchez, Mississippi.<br /><br />Cat is from an extremely wealthy influential family in Natchez and she grew up in a huge mansion called Malmaison, that is a replication of Napoleon's summer home in France. When she arrives it is night and she goes to her old bedroom and goes straight to sleep. The next morning she is awakened by a little Negro girl, Natriece, who is the great grand daughter of Pearlie, the woman who raised her. Natriece has gotten into Cats things including some of her forensic chemicals and spilled some, revealing bloody footprints from twenty three years previous.<br /><br />Cat was eight when her father Luke was murdered by a prowler. He was shot outside by a large Dogwood tree but why was there blood in her bedroom? Things that she was told when she was eight are not adding up and this leads Cat to start her own parallel investigation at Malmaison much to the chagrin of her maternal grandfather, Dr William Kirkland.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Cat is a mess because she was abused as a child and Iles expertly weaves a sordid tale around that fact. But it seems that Cat is the tip of the iceberg. Others have been abused as well and murders are happening as a result. Are Cat's parallel investigations connected? It certainly seems so at times and that keeps you turning them pages. In fact Cat barely avoids being murdered herself, not once but twice.<br /><br />Child abuse is a hot button for me. That is why I took my title from Pat Benetar's passionate song about child abuse. I cannot understand how any descent being could take advantage of a helpless child but I guess pedophiles are not descent, are they? In addition to being a very interesting read, the book also provided some interesting statistics and insights regarding Sexual Child Abuse so if you have any interest in this subject at all, it's worth your time to read \\"Blood Memory\\"<br /><br />Blood Memory is a story of 494 pages with numerous twists and turns. Greg Iles is an exceptional writer, especially on his home turf of Natchez. That was the setting for the previously mentioned \\"The Quiet Game\\" a wonderful story about an aged murder and this story is similar in that respect. Iles' writing is fluid and fun to read. The style is easy to follow and compelling. I can't recommend his writing enough.g them pages.

US	38622886	R2DWBF8HNQ2JF	0446576638	294324369	Night Fall	Books	3	7	10	N	Y	A Tragedy, Shrouded in Mystery, Wrapped in an Enigma	The Plot<br /><br />A married man and woman engage in a sexual escapade on a Long Island beach on a fateful summer night. They have just finished fornicating and are lying naked on the beach when they notice a streak of light ascending in the twilight sky followed by a small then large explosion and ultimately a large aircraft eventually tumbling into the sea. What makes this couple different from hundreds of other witnesses is that they were videotaping their lovemaking and the video camera caught everything they witnessed. The only problem was they would never come forward because this married couple were not married to each other. Instead they grabbed the video camera and a few of their belongings and evanesced into the night in such a hurry that they left some evidence of their tryst behind.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />Night Fall is the latest novel by Nelson Demille, a prolific author of good repute. For his latest effort, Demille has taken the July 17, 1996, TWA flight 800 tragedy as his subject.<br /><br />For Night Fall, Demille brings back the intractable, wise cracking homicide detective (aren`t they all) John Corey. Corey you may remember was the hero in Demille's penultimate book before Nightfall - The Lion's Game. He was also in one of my favorites, Plum Island. So what's a homicide detective doing in a story about an airliner crash? It seems John is on temporary assignment as a contract agent with the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force in New York and works on the same floor as his newlywed wife, FBI agent KateMayfield.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />It is now July 17, 2001 and Kate drags her husband to the fifth anniversary memorial services for the crash victims. Kate was one of the witness interviewers after the crash five years previous, an experience that has left her with a bad feeling after the official explanation was released after an allegedly extensive investigation and She has attended each of the annual memorial services and this was no exception. What was an exception was her motive for attending this year and bringing John along.<br /><br />Kate had been told in no uncertain terms and at the risk of her career to cease any more inquiries about the tragedy. Being a career FBI agent and not wishing to be sent to International Falls Minnesota, she gave the appearance of caving in but she had an ace whose name was John Corey.<br /><br />After the Memorial, Kate took John to three nearby locations where he met with two extremely credible witnesses with two totally divergent views of what had happened. John, a curious individual by nature was hooked. Kate thought that John might be able to investigate under the radar and no one would be any the wiser but that was not to be. They were found out and sent on separate overseas assignments for three months as punishment, but that did not deter John. Something was fishy and he was going to find out what it was if it was the last thing he would do, which it almost was.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Night Fall is a novel about a real subject. As such it purports to uncover an investigational cover-up, through an illegal investigation by John Corey, which ends up going nowhere. I am left with the question after finishing the book - what was that all about?<br /><br />As usual Demille does his homework. He exudes a great deal of knowledge about incident, laying out a case that debunks the accepted cause which is an electric malfunction. He describes how eight hundred witnesses were interviewed, two hundred of which reported seeing a steak of light, ostensibly a missile, heading toward the airplane seconds before the explosions, were seemingly ignored.<br /><br />Part of my problem with the book was that I couldn't figure out where the facts ended and fiction began. Were there really two hundred ignored witnesses and was a large portion of the central part of the superstructure never recovered? Was Demille, through John Corey, on to something, or was everything a fabrication? I guess that's why the story goes nowhere and leaves the reader with many questions.<br /><br />How well the book is written is another matter. Demille's writing is smooth and compelling. he generates a lot of interest quickly, making the book hard to put down. The actual writing was clever, perhaps a bit too clever in that Demille tries to equip Corey with a dry sense of humor equivalent to a stand up comedian. This routine of satirical one liners from Corey is so pervasive that, while enjoyable at first, it wears a little thin and after a while it gets somewhat corny. For instance while driving up a street in an exclusive guarded subdivision, Quail Hollow Lane, Corey wondered to himself how you could tell if a Quail was hollow - cute.<br /><br />While I gave the book only three stars it was not because of the writing. In a nutshell we have a three star story presented in a five star manner. Hmmm..., perhaps I should give it a four star rating by average? No not when we have Hollow Quails and a few other pseudo jocular utterances.orey, on to something, or was everything a fabrication?

(Yes they actually taught history then, geography too!) His was a story of which legends are born. Several years later I read a book on Hannibal by Harold Lamb simply titled Hannibal.<br /><br />Harold Lamb - now deceased - was a historical writer. He wrote numerous books about intriguing subjects like The Crusades, Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, Tamerlane, Alexander, Charlemagne, Fredrick the Great, Cyrus the Great and on and on, most of which I read. While I did receive a rudimentary background on all these characters and events in school, it was Harold Lamb that really brought these historical icons to life and of all of these larger than life legends, nobody did more with less than Hannibal Barca.<br /><br />I'm sure many of you readers are probably familiar with the popular football parlance \\"The Best Defense Is a Good Offense\\". Well Hannibal was no football player but he sure utilized that theory. Hell, he invented it when, as a defensive maneuver, the great Carthaginian General crossed the Alps with a diverse army of forty thousand men and forty Elephants in the winter of 218 BC to confront Carthage's bitter enemy, fast rising power Rome. Most of his Elephants and many of his men perished on this trip.<br /><br />Rome was a bully, an implacable foe and saw Carthage the only power on the horizon as a threat. Carthage was a prosperous city state of peaceful sea faring traders located directly south of Sicily, across the Mediterranean Sea, on the African coast (near present day Tunis). Carthage had fought two wars with Rome, fought mostly to a stalemate but in its most recent humiliating treaty with Rome they were restricted from applying their trade in the Mediterranean except in Spain and not above the Ebro River.<br /><br />This virtually ceded the Mediterranean to Rome and forced Carthage to venture beyond the Pillars of Hercules to the Atlantic shores of Spain (actually today's Portugal). Hamilcar, Hannibal's father, a successful warrior general in his own right, colonized this area and built, among others, the village of New Carthage with thrived and grew into a powerful city. Hamilcar's brother, Hasdrubal, who took over after his brother's death, began consolidating power on the Iberian Peninsula including building villages on the Mediterranean coast. Hannibal, now a grown man and head of the army laid siege, albeit unsuccessfully to Saguntum. Eventually, Saguntum, a Greek city and Roman ally on the Spanish coast, complained to Rome about the Carthaginians.<br /><br />This matter was put before the Senate where it was decided to issue an ultimatum, turn over Hannibal to Rome or face war. To the Roman emissaries' surprise, Carthage would not back down. War was mutually decided, hence Hannibal was notified and Hannibal and forty thousand men and forty elephants began their odyssey into history.<br /><br />Hannibal's Coming<br /><br />I'm sure you've heard someone tell their children \\"the Boogey Man is going to get you\\". Maybe you said it yourself, I know I have. The Roman \\"Boogey Man\\" was Hannibal. \\"Hannibal's coming. He's going to get you\\". Well Hannibal did more than scare little children. He scared the bejesus out of the whole country. Hannibal was a master tactician and General. He defeated one Roman army after another and spent twelve long years terrorizing the public in the Roman countryside. Hannibal was the man behind Rome's greatest defeat the famous Battle of Cannae in which not one but two great Roman armies faced the inscrutable, Carthaginian nemesis Hannibal. The Roman annihilation was crushing. Not only were fifty thousand warriors including ninety percent of their Tribunes killed but eighty members of the Senate who came to watch the slaughter were in turn slaughtered.<br /><br />Rome was in a panic. No army stood between Hannibal and the capital and they prepared for a siege. Some of Hannibal's trusted officers urged him to advance on Rome but Hannibal blinked and in the end, many years later, it was his and Carthage's downfall.<br /><br />Hannibal was a great tactician but he had little experience and no previous success (ref: Saguntum) in laying siege to a fortified position so he was unable to consolidate his victories. In the twelve years he received little in the way of supplies or re-enforcement from Carthage, mostly living off the land and gaining recruits from subjugated people within. One time when his younger brother attempted to replicate Hannibal's trek across the Alps a messenger was intercepted leading to the destruction of the force and his brother's decapitated head being thrown into Hannibal's camp.<br /><br />Eventually, as the fortunes started to change Hannibal's army started to melt away through deserters and attrition. In the end the great General met his end defending Carthage from overwhelming superiority.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Harold Lamb was a master at telling historical yarns. Where there were voids in the accepted historical record, Lamb sometimes interpolated events to fill in the gaps. His books are fun to read and I think he makes the subject, so many find boring, eminently compelling. His writing, though written by a scholar is not highbrow and is very easy to follow. It is written for the masses not for the few.<br /><br />The book I read was only two hundred and eighty pages but the writing is small and probably equates to a present day book about a hundred pages longer.ed for a siege.

Nora Sinclair is gorgeous, sexy, desirable, clever, personable, witty, vivacious and talented, oh yeah and DEADLY! She is what's known as a Black Widow, a woman who seduces and eventually sacrifices her partner to the God of Greed and Avarice.<br /><br />Nora's fianc&eacute;, Conner Brown is a catch himself. Only forty years old and extremely rich as well as good looking, Conner met the lovely Nora when, on the recommendation of a friend, he had her redecorate his entire twenty-three room estate. Nora, blessed with taste, refinement and panache, could have made a great living doing what she represented herself to be - a decorator. Nora who didn't advertise and only took referrals found no challenge in decorating at least not like her sideline, poisoning her lovers and getting away with it, plus it was less profitable.<br /><br />Conner was not Nora's first victim, nor was he her last and it did look like she got away with murder again but she was under investigation. Craig Reynolds showed up at her door (actually Conner's) shortly after the funeral, announcing a one point nine million dollar policy naming her as beneficiary. Cool, she thought but Conner was rich, why would he bother she asked. The affable Reynolds said he didn't know but explained his company sometimes gave the CEOs such a policy free with a large group policy.<br /><br />Reynolds was smooth as was Nora so they gravitated to each other. Reynolds was actually a government agent named John O hara, who though his job was to investigate Nora, wound up, to his disgrace, spending some quality time under the sheets with his assignment. The question was who would out smooth the other?<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />Honeymoon certainly held my interest so I read it rapidly. The plot was nothing new but Patterson's spin was. There was a secondary plot which was supposed to tie into the story by providing a rationale for investigating Nora in the first place and tying both plots near the ending but I found this sub plot to be both ambiguous and clumsy and I thought it detracted from the main plot, which was good.<br /><br />Overall the character development was good but not great. The author's hinted at a poor, possibly abusive childhood for Nora but didn't really go into it. Nora's mother was arrested for shooting Nora's father in front of her when she was six and she went to a series of foster homes. After going to prison, Nora's mother ended up at a rest home, ostensibly demented, and Nora visited her there. Likewise with Reynolds/O hara, though you got a good feeling for both main characters, you didn't feel you really knew them.<br /><br />Considering the book was relatively short at 390 pages with a whopping 112 chapters, (I'm estimating about 85,000 words) I felt more background wouldn't have hurt.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />James Patterson seems to be an enigma. He writes a lot of books, twenty-seven at last count. None are bad, well maybe one or two and none are great, well maybe three or four but most seem to range from average to not quite great. Honeymoon is one of the latter variety. It could have been great but didn't quite make the cut. Also the way the story was presented did not leave much of a mystery. Those who like surprise endings might be disappointed.<br /><br />After writing twenty-seven books Patterson has developed a descent writing style. (if he and not Roughman who is co-author actually wrote it) His writing is style is fluid and not overly detailed, though I wish he would have gone into more detail regarding background on Nora Sinclair.<br /><br />No twists and turns but a good read anyway. Final Rating: 3.7 starsnale for investigating Nora in the first place and tying both plots near the ending but I found this sub plot to be both ambiguous and clumsy and I thought it detracted from the main plot, which was good.  <br /> <br />Overall the character development was good but not great.

US	38622886	R3U92NNNPA1H2M	0765306913	579683698	Crisscross: A Repairman Jack Novel	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Clever, Clever, Clever	To those who know him, Repairman Jack is without a doubt the most beloved of the contemporary fictional figures, bar none. He has a fan club, Stephen King is a charter member, after his first book and a couple short stories, he disappeared for ten years and was bought back by popular demand.<br /><br />Jack could be described as a fixer - you got problem and for a fee he can fix it, or a champion of the oppressed - you can't afford a fee, we'll work something out. To the government he doesn't exist. He has never collected a paycheck and has never paid income tax. He has no credit, no credit cards, no FICO score, has never voted, has no social security card, has never been arrested, has no driver's license or passport (at least in his real name). In short he works outside the system totally under the radar.<br /><br />In Crisscross, Jack has two new clients. One is a strange elderly lady with a dog, named Herta (in the last few books there have been strange ladies with dogs, the last one of which told Jack there would be no more coincidences in his life). It seems her son had joined the fast growing Dormentalist Church and recently she has lost touch with him. The second is a moderately attractive young lady, Maggie, (whom Jack finds out later is a nun) who is being blackmailed for some compromising photos.<br /><br />To get the lowdown on the Dormentalists, Jack meets with reporter Jamie Grant, who recently ran the first installment of an expos&eacute; on the Dormentalist Church. He plans on infiltrating the church by joining, to which Jamie informs him it's not that easy, proceeding to tell him why. Jack, with help from acquaintances, lays groundwork to attract the top gun of Dormentalism, one Luther Bradley by claiming to be one guy while carrying identification which purports that Jack is one Jason Amari, the wealthy son of an even wealthier businessman. Naturally the security chief discovers this and Jack finds himself in with the head honcho, Bradley because of the families apparent wealth.<br /><br />On the Blackmail end, Jack finds out who the blackmailer is, a crumb named Richie Cordova, who plays at being a private investigator but in reality is a private shake down artist. Jack figures Maggies pictures and others are probably on his computer and he probably has a back up, so he makes arrangement, again with the help of an acquaintance, to introduce a virus into Cordova's computer and follow him to locate the backup.<br /><br />Things are moving along swimmingly on both fronts when little by little things start to unravel. The Church security chief, a behemoth of a man named Jensen thinks there is something fishy about Amari and continues to check him out, eventually locating a photo of the reclusive Amari and after having all his blackmail files destroyed by Jack, Cordova discovers that it was done purposely by someone and Maggie was the one that hired him.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This story is a little slow getting started but about halfway through it really gets going big time. Wilson does a superb job of merging the two separate undertakings into one remarkably clever ending. As advertised the Domentalist Church is a vessel of the Otherness and Jack must find a way to stop Bradley and save humanity and life as we know it.<br /><br />As usual, Wilson's writing style is very reader friendly. Wilson, a physician by trade, (or maybe it's a sideline by now) is not interested in talking down to his readers but merely telling his story. His writing is fluid and smooth without too much detail and Wilson has always been a great storyteller with some of the most ingenuous and intriguing plots I have read.<br /><br />I should probably warn you, there is some brutality, though it is a fact and not described and is mild compared to some previous books by Wilson. I have been reading Wilson since he came out with the book \\"The Keep\\" twenty five years ago, which was the first of the previously mentioned Adversary Cycle and was followed closely by \\"The Tomb\\", the first Repairman Jack novel.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little different, maybe a little bizarre, this certainly fills the bill. The downside though may be that once you've read this novel you may be compelled to go back and see what you missed in previous stories.ned Adversary Cycle and was followed closely by \\"The Tomb\\", the first Repairman Jack novel.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for something a little different, maybe a little bizarre, this certainly fills the bill.

US	38622886	R2VMXAZM9QFRIE	006055438X	57180289	State of Fear	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Misinformation and Environmental Terrorism	The world is a scary place! We have religious zealots declaring war on us and indiscriminately killing perceived enemies of God. We have drugged out addicts robbing and burglarizing to scrape up enough money for their next score. We have people shooting at each other on the freeways in a fit of rage. Then there's the gangs and the drive by shootings, car jackings and let's not forget the school yard and work place shootings. Then, if that isn't bad enough we have all these problems with the environment. Let's see, there's the \\"Acid Rain\\" problem, polluted lakes and streams, endangered species, depleted Ozone Layer and potentially the most crippling of all, 'Global Warming'.<br /><br />\\"Global Warming\\" sounds really scary doesn't it? Especially for our children and grandchildren but if Michael Crighton's controversial latest novel State of Fear is to be believed there is no \\"Global Warming\\" and some of the other so called environmental crises are blown out of proportion as well.<br /><br />Michael Crighton weaves an ingenious yarn around the fictitious National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF), an environmental charity, whose main purpose seems to be self preservation. The head of NERF is Nick Drake a tall slender man with an agenda. His main contributor is wealthy philanthropist George Morton. Other characters of importance are Morton's lovely secretary, Sarah Jones and his somewhat wimpy lawyer, Peter Evans. Also Government agent, Professor John Kenner and Jennifer Hayes play significant roles in the story.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />The overall plot is to demonstrate that environmental charities can be just as self serving as industry itself and that studies funded by grants or provided by in house scientists, regarding pollution and other environmental issues, tend to be skewed and exaggerated in favor of their benefactor, whomever it might be, on both sides of the issue.<br /><br />The subplot is that environmental terrorists are planning four cataclysmic events leading up to a global environmental conference to set the stage for world wide PR campaign and discussion on the imminent danger from 'Global Warming' and other such issues.<br /><br />Agent John Kenner, who has knowledge of the eco-terrorists plans enlists the aid of Evans, Jones and Hayes in a world wide escapade to try and thwart the terrorists destructive schemes.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />State of Fear is a fast paced story that after the first five chapters seems to be told in the first person by Peter Evans. The first five chapters take place in Paris, Panang (Malaysia), England, Tokyo and Vancouver and chronicles the eco terrorists preparations for their planned catastrophic events. These events, which were supposed to dramatize the repercussions from 'Global Warming' include creating an underwater rock slide, which is suppose to include a massive tsunami, eerily mimicking the recent actual tragic events in the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />Even good books by excellent writers sometimes have inconsistencies. While the other planned events could be attributed to 'Global Warming', this reader fails to see how a seismic event and subsequent tsunami could be connected to 'Global Warming'.<br /><br />There may have been one or two more inconsistencies noted but they were minor and it did not detract from the overall quality and edification of the book.<br /><br />I also had a problem with a scene near the end of the book where a man was literally eaten alive by cannibals. the book is not overtly violent and I felt this episode could have been avoided or at least modified.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Clearly, State of Fear should be considered Visionary Fiction - that which enlightens while it entertains. In fact I don't know if I have ever read a novel where I learned more. Michael Crighton's ulterior motive for writing this book seems to be the dissemination of information to counter the exaggerated and in some cases, unscientific environmental predictions of doom that have been floating around. I know, personally, I'll be more cynical about what dangers are being presented to me as fact in the future by the media which acts as lightning rod for misinformation.<br /><br />That is what's good about the book but it's also what's bad. Although the fallacy of normally accepted environmental concerns were sometimes pointed out by environmentalists themselves (you have to read the book), parts of the book remind me of a college debate. One couldn't help but feel that, rightly or wrongly, they were being preached to by the author, who used this book masterfully as his sales tool.<br /><br />In fact the author even provides a large Bibliography, similar to an informational Non-Fiction book and an Appendix in which he presents a dissertation entitled, Why Politicized Science Is Dangerous and His own personal message, entitled Author's Message. It is obvious that Michael Crighton feels very strongly about this subject yet he professes neutrality in the final statement of his message - Everybody has an agenda.

We have religious zealots declaring war on us and indiscriminately killing perceived enemies of God. We have drugged out addicts robbing and burglarizing to scrape up enough money for their next score. We have people shooting at each other on the freeways in a fit of rage. Then there's the gangs and the drive by shootings, car jackings and let's not forget the school yard and work place shootings. Then, if that isn't bad enough we have all these problems with the environment. Let's see, there's the \\"Acid Rain\\" problem, polluted lakes and streams, endangered species, depleted Ozone Layer and potentially the most crippling of all, 'Global Warming'.<br /><br />\\"Global Warming\\" sounds really scary doesn't it? Especially for our children and grandchildren but if Michael Crighton's controversial latest novel State of Fear is to be believed there is no \\"Global Warming\\" and some of the other so called environmental crises are blown out of proportion as well.<br /><br />Michael Crighton weaves an ingenious yarn around the fictitious National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF), an environmental charity, whose main purpose seems to be self preservation. The head of NERF is Nick Drake a tall slender man with an agenda. His main contributor is wealthy philanthropist George Morton. Other characters of importance are Morton's lovely secretary, Sarah Jones and his somewhat wimpy lawyer, Peter Evans. Also Government agent, Professor John Kenner and Jennifer Hayes play significant roles in the story.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />The overall plot is to demonstrate that environmental charities can be just as self serving as industry itself and that studies funded by grants or provided by in house scientists, regarding pollution and other environmental issues, tend to be skewed and exaggerated in favor of their benefactor, whomever it might be, on both sides of the issue.<br /><br />The subplot is that environmental terrorists are planning four cataclysmic events leading up to a global environmental conference to set the stage for world wide PR campaign and discussion on the imminent danger from 'Global Warming' and other such issues.<br /><br />Agent John Kenner, who has knowledge of the eco-terrorists plans enlists the aid of Evans, Jones and Hayes in a world wide escapade to try and thwart the terrorists destructive schemes.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />State of Fear is a fast paced story that after the first five chapters seems to be told in the first person by Peter Evans. The first five chapters take place in Paris, Panang (Malaysia), England, Tokyo and Vancouver and chronicles the eco terrorists preparations for their planned catastrophic events. These events, which were supposed to dramatize the repercussions from 'Global Warming' include creating an underwater rock slide, which is suppose to include a massive tsunami, eerily mimicking the recent actual tragic events in the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />Even good books by excellent writers sometimes have inconsistencies. While the other planned events could be attributed to 'Global Warming', this reader fails to see how a seismic event and subsequent tsunami could be connected to 'Global Warming'.<br /><br />There may have been one or two more inconsistencies noted but they were minor and it did not detract from the overall quality and edification of the book.<br /><br />I also had a problem with a scene near the end of the book where a man was literally eaten alive by cannibals. the book is not overtly violent and I felt this episode could have been avoided or at least modified.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Clearly, State of Fear should be considered Visionary Fiction - that which enlightens while it entertains. In fact I don't know if I have ever read a novel where I learned more. Michael Crighton's ulterior motive for writing this book seems to be the dissemination of information to counter the exaggerated and in some cases, unscientific environmental predictions of doom that have been floating around. I know, personally, I'll be more cynical about what dangers are being presented to me as fact in the future by the media which acts as lightning rod for misinformation.<br /><br />That is what's good about the book but it's also what's bad.

US	38622886	R1JJ3DFZ95QPY9	0385510454	797048445	The Broker: A Novel	Books	3	3	6	N	N	What happened to John Grisham?	Until about fifteen years ago, I used to be stuck on Science Fiction and Fantasy books, until that is, I read John Grisham's, then latest novel, The Firm. Like the present day Da Vinci Code phenomenon, Grisham splashed into the scene with The Firm, which was somewhat of a phenomenon in 1990-91, except The Firm was twice as good. In fact The Firm was twice as good as anything out there at the time, including Grisham's other popular books like The Pelican Brief and A Time To Kill and those books are twice as good as The Broker.<br /><br />What happened to John Grisham? The Broker is not a bad book. At least not for an average writer but Grisham is not an average writer or at least he didn't used to be. He has written some of the most memorable books around. Let's see, they have made something like seven of his books into movies and they're probably working on another as I write this.<br /><br />It seems that Mr Grisham has started off on such a high note that he can't even come close to his earlier successes. Five of his last six books have been also rans. (The Last Juror was pretty good in my estimation) Evidently Grisham is having a problem coming up with storylines and developing descent plots, and that is the biggest problem with The Broker - a weak plot.<br /><br />The Broker<br /><br />Joel Backman, a self promoting power hungry Washington power broker/lobbyist had gone too far and ended up in federal prison for twenty years. All of a sudden he's granted an eleventh hour Presidential pardon and whisked off to Italy, Where he's never been and he doesn't even speak the language. What Happened?<br /><br />This whole mess started when three young Pakistani hackers discovered some unknown orbiting, state of the art, satellites and managed to compromise, disable and gain control of them. They then proceeded to hire Backman to find a buyer for the controlling devices. This proves to be disastrous as Backman is indicted for treason and his confederate, Jacy Hubbard is murdered, enticing Backman to plead guilty to a lesser charge for self preservation.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />Teddy Maynard the wheelchair bound Director of Intelligence sees an opportunity to clean up the Backman mess. Vanilla President Morgen is about to leave office after his crushing repudiation. Maynard thinks Morgen is a dunce but he wants this one last favor, to grant a pardon to Backman and to this end he gets Morgen's chief of Staff, Critz to intercede in favor.<br /><br />Backman has been a thorn in Maynard's side for six years and had been stony silent about the events leading to his incarceration and he was not likely to get any information from him in the future. He had been Director for eighteen years and felt the incoming President would probably eventually replace him, so he figured this might be his last best chance to tie up the Backman loose end and get one last tidbit of information. Who would be the ones who would kill Backman? Would it be the Israelis, The Saudis, The Russians or the Chinese?<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Apparently Grisham is trying to change his luck by changing what he writes about. Being a Mississippi attorney, he honed his writing skills writing about Lawyers and Law, a profession he seems to disdain based on the stories he's written. After this foray into action -thrillers, he should probably stay within the legal field.<br /><br />Grisham's writing style, which is fluid, descriptive and easy going is still evident in this book which I would describe as a thrillerless thriller but the protagonist, who's life was supposed to be in danger, never even seems close to getting killed and the whole premise for the story seems very weak, especially from such an esteemed author.<br /><br />The setting, primarily in Bologna Italy seems strange as well. The head spook ostensibly wants to set Backman up for a hit yet he sets him up in Italy with a couple handlers and gives him a crash course in Italian. Why bother! Why not just dump him somewhere, leak his whereabouts and watch the fireworks. Of course we have the bunch that gave us phantom WMD in Iraq and failed to prevent the 9/11 catastrophe, trying to set up our man for a hit. Naturally the Keystone Spooks botch that as well.<br /><br />Anyway Grisham makes up for the weak plot by some nice writing. We don't know what to think of Backman who seems to change before our eyes. He seems to grow as a person, becomes enchanted with the simple life Italy has to offer and finds a love interest in one of his two language tutors who is also a tour guide. Grisham goes into great detail in his substantial descriptions of Treviso, Bologna and Milan, all located in a country he says he is fascinated with and most likely the reason for the setting.<br /><br />Recommended only for die hard Grisham readers and those interested in Italy.e in Italian.

There are three main characters in this novel, Fric, the precocious son of Hollywood's biggest star, Channing Manheim, known in the business as the 'Face'. Being rich beyond imagination, Manheim owns a sprawling estate in Bel Air, with a staff in the dozens including a twenty-four/seven security staff headed by former policeman Ethan Truman. That takes care of the good, now for the bad we have a character, Corky Laputa an avowed anarchist who in his spare time from being a college professor, spreads the seeds of chaos and dissension any way he can.<br /><br />Another character that needs to be mentioned is Ethan's wayward and somewhat estranged childhood friend, Dunny Whistler, who after fighting for his life for three months in the hospital after four thugs held his head in a toilet bowl for several minutes finally succumbed. Or did he?<br /><br />When Ethan went to the hospital to identify the deceased Dunny was AWOL and Dunny appears occasionally throughout the story as a person/ghost of importance.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />As chief of security Ethan starts receiving small wrapped boxes containing strange divergent items, a warning of sorts, which Ethan assumes portends some sort of pending attempt on `The Face's' life, but the sender made a mistake on this last package. Previous packages were delivered anonymously by delivery services, like UPS but this time the perp (Love those cop terms) was caught on a security camera, well at least his car and license plate was.<br /><br />So, after tracking down the license plate, Ethan is off to confront the perp whereupon he is killed, yes shot dead by the perp who suckered Ethan and had a gun hidden is a potato chip bag shooting him several times.<br /><br />At least that's what Ethan is sure happened when he is back in his car in front of the perp's house. Was it a premonition? Should he go in? A bemused Ethan finally drives off continuing a twilight zone of sorts of bizarre events leading up to the nefarious Corky Laputa's forewarned assault at the Manning Estate.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The Face was certainly a fast fun read, despite its lengthily 557 pages but I would not count The Face among Koontz's best novels. Yes, it's an interesting story but not a compelling story. Koontz's writing as usual flows well and is user friendly, though he does go off on tangents and sometimes puts emphasis on minutia. If I have a fault with this book it is that to me the story seemed forced like he decided out of the blue to write about a movie Idol. Though The Face was well written it was not, at least for me, a page turner.<br /><br />It took me a couple weeks to finish this book and though I was not disappointed, neither was I ebullient. I suppose the character of Corky Laputa and his lack of motive was a problem for me and even though he was a mean, nasty individual, he never seemed to pose the overwhelmingly ominous threat Koontz tried to impute and which have permeated many of his other books. Still Koontz sets up an interesting overall scenario and carries it off quite well, shortfalls and all.<br /><br />So I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though I don't consider this to be an exceptional book it still is a worthwhile read, especially for die hard Koontz fans.f continuing a twilight zone of sorts of bizarre events leading up to the nefarious Corky Laputa's forewarned assault at the Manning Estate.  <br /> <br />Conclusion  <br /> <br />The Face was certainly a fast fun read, despite its lengthily 557 pages but I would not count The Face among Koontz's best novels.

During a ninety-six hour period nine people have succumbed to not one, not two but three extremely rare diseases, especially for New York City. Jack Stapleton is the New York city Medical Examiner who discovered these occurrences in the course of performing autopsies upon the victims and while no one has questioned the natural occurrence of these deadly, highly infectious diseases, Jack eventually comes to the conclusion that these events are too much of a coincidence to be accidental.<br /><br />Contagion was written by a prolific writer named Robin Cook. If you are not familiar with Cook you should be. He is the unquestioned king of the medical mystery/suspense genre, having written well over twenty such books, dating back to the seventies. If you happen to remember the scary movie Coma, that was Robin Cook.<br /><br />With not one but three different extremely rare pathogens killing patients at the New York hospital, Stapleton suspects it's more than just coincidence. But Jack can't seem to get anybody's attention, especially at the Hospital itself where the management even resents and has barred his presence. This leads Jack to suspect there may be a connection between the mysterious microbes responsible for the deaths and the HMO that owns the hospital, Americare, the same HMO that once destroyed his flourishing medical practice. However Jack is unable to convince his friends and co-workers Chet and Laurie or his bosses that these occurrences are being orchestrated, even after a deadly form of Influenza makes an appearance killing many more patients and hospital staff.<br /><br />Could Americare deliberately killing off its sickest patients - those who cost the most money to treat? If not, is there an even more dastardly motive behind the mysterious happenings at Manhattan General, and what about the sudden attempts on Jack's life by members of a black gang who surprisingly rescued by members of another black gang?<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Contagion is a fun read, one that, as commonly happens with an intriguing book, I kept finding reasons to to read when I should be doing other things. Though Cook is known to throw in a generous dose of medical terms I forgive him, it is after all a MEDICAL THRILLER! Other than that his writing is fluid and user friendly, though sometimes a little weak when it comes to character development, and his fulminations about the dangers of managed care tend to compete with the plot. Still, to his credit, Cook doesn't try to overwhelm you with his obvious intellect. He writes to be understood and appreciated by the masses.<br /><br />Speaking of the plot, Cook manages to instill a little bi-racial tolerance by having his protagonist (Jack)living in a flat in Harlem and becoming a basketball buddy with Warren, the imposing leader of a black gang. Coincidently another black gang is hired first to scare then to kill Jack and the interplay between good and bad black guys was a nice touch. In fact there were many nice touches which overcame some weaknesses which, to me, became evident toward the end of the book. But even though I questioned the improbable rational for the murders, I was totally surprised by the identity of of the perps.<br /><br />Beware, Contagion may make you think twice about going to the hospital short of anything life threatening.rescued by members of another black gang?  <br /> <br />CONCLUSION  <br /> <br />Contagion is a fun read, one that, as commonly happens with an intriguing book, I kept finding reasons to to read when I should be doing other things.

It seems after apparently bending down to pick up their stateroom key, Joey's husband Chaz, grabbed her ankles and flipped her over the rail.<br /><br />So begins the newest Carl Hiaasen novel, Skinny Dip, one of the absolute funniest books I've ever read. After recently grinding through The 9/11 Commission Report and other dry publications, I was ready for something light and whimsical and from my experience nobody's writing is more droll than my man Hiaasen.<br /><br />Skinny Dip is Hiassen's tenth solo novel and as with the others is set in his home state of Florida. At 354 pages it's a fast, thoroughly enjoyable read. While Hiaasen's wit is undeniable, there is an underlying agenda in his books. It is obvious that Mr. Hiassen is an environmentalist and is not happy with the wanton rapid, seemingly unregulated development taking place in Florida, but true to his nature, he makes light of his concerns, showing his displeasure through his unsavory if not hilarious heavies.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for a light entertaining read I highly recommend Hiaasen, especially Skinny Dip.	2004-11-04

Clarke has stripped away their cover and exposed them all for us to see. There could be nothing more damning for President Bush than the White House Counter-terrorism co-ordinator, in the aftermath of the most destructive terrorist event in the history of the world, saying in his new book that among other things, Bush and his National Security Advisor did not seem to have a handle on or as least underestimated how dangerous an adversary Al Queda and Bin Laden was and in the immediate aftermath of 9-11, Bush and his staff perseverated upon Iraq as co-conspirator, even to the point of trying to get subordinates to find (or invent) evidence of Saddam's complicity. It seems the smarmy Rumsfield was fascinated by the concept of attacking the target rich Iraqis.<br /><br />Ultimately Bush did the right thing and went to Afghanistan but he obviously never forgot Iraq. Clarke also thinks the invasion of Iraq was a mistake as well, taking valuable resources from Afghanistan, squandering the post 9-11 good will of the world and creating a whole new generation of terrorists by generally enraging most of the Muslims. As Clark puts it, If Osama bin Laden were to have a wish list, this invasion would probably top the list. It has separated us from our allies and world opinion, has given bin Laden an anti America forum and gave him and all terrorists a place to confront the Great Satan head on.<br /><br />Clarke's focus was not entirely on Bush. He also was not totally happy with the policies or responses to terrorist related events in his previous eight years with the Clinton administration, though just as previous events paled in comparison to the shock of 9-11, the damage to the sitting president is certainly greater, especially in the heat of his re-election campaign. I find what Mr Clarke has to say both convincing and compelling. What he says about his former employers apparent ineptitude, though not criminally negligent, makes the Bush team look very bad.<br /><br />In all honesty it seems to me that Clarke had an axe to grind. He was retained by the incoming administration, though his position was downgraded to staff instead of a Cabinet level position. I may be wrong but there also seems to be an underlying acrimony between Dr. Rice (his boss) and himself and finally I believe Clarke was unhappy at not being considered for the new Homeland Security Czar.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />All this does not diminish from Clarke's insightful revelations in Against All Enemies, especially when backed up by former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's recent revealing book \\"The Price of Loyalty\\" and it seems to answer some of the nagging unresolved questions I had about this administration. It is certainly true that there are enormous synergies between Against All Enemies and The Price of Loyalty. They describe the same bemused, indecisive, out of their league, White House and many of the things that Clarke worried about are clearly comming to pass.eight years with the Clinton administration, though just as previous events paled in comparison to the shock of 9-11, the damage to the sitting president is certainly greater, especially in the heat of his re-election campaign.

This book will certainly make you wonder.<br /><br />No Bush family member is left unscathed, however the author saves the big guns for G.W. Bush. The author's depiction of George W. Bush is not complimentary. He seems to have risen to his level of incompetency. He has achieved the highest office in the world, gone off on another misadventure and there is no one to bail him out.<br /><br />Georgie born and raised in privilege has never really ever had to fend for himself. If he got in trouble, support was always a phone call away. This coupled with his sense of divine calling has imbued Georgie with a false sense of infallibility, a born leader(remember how often he uses the term leadership). He also seems to have an inability to confront and admit bad news. We see this daily in the coverage of the Bush War in Iraq. This was evident quite early when young Georgie was working on his father's friend, Red Blount's Senatorial campaign in Alabama in 1972. George, who when he showed up, came in around noon, had the job of monitoring the polls \\"but he kept the bad news to himself. On Election Day, his roommate, Devere Mclennan was preparing for a victory-night party. 'That's when he explained to me we weren't going to win' he said\\"<br /><br />This of course begs the question, who in this administration, if not the President, is going to level with us about bad news?<br /><br />Well if you think about it we have had some clues. I believe Colin Powell has at times and former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and former White House Terrorist Czar Richard Clark among others have given some insights.<br /><br />But overall, reading the president is like the Russian's used to say about reading Pravda. You get your news, not by what's said but by what's not said.<br /><br />The book also goes into some detail about other family members, especially G.W,s younger brothers Jeb the current Governor of Florida without who's help Georgie would not have made President and Neil who was embroiled in the Savings and Loan scandals.<br /><br />Overall the Bushes don't come of as bad people. Every family has blemishes and warts. Yes they are a hotbed of cronyism, greed and power but that seems to be a relatively common thread among the very rich. What bothers me most about the Bushes is the overestimation of their self worth and their constant struggle to project an image of intellectual morality that is just not true.<br /><br />As Vice President and running for President, George Sr. once told, what he thought was a funny story to his associates. If I may paraphrase it - One day on the way to school it was snowing so bad that my chauffeur, Alec couldn't see and he ran off the road into a snow drift. His associates were dumbfounded and after looking at each other, one of them told George \\"Don't tell that story to anyone else.

Perhaps it's because it takes him a while to get into his stories and maybe it's because his protagonists are not particularly lovable nor are the antagonists especially dastardly. Nevertheless, in hindsight, I have never read a Turrow novel that, ultimately I did not enjoy. Reversible Errors is such a book. The kind that at fifty or sixty pages you are wondering if it's worth finishing and at a hundred and fifty pages you are hooked.<br /><br />Reversible Errors has five main characters; Arthur Raven, Rommy Gandolf, Larry Starczek, Muriel Wynn and Gillian Sullivan. The story takes place in an unnamed fictional midwest city.<br /><br />Rommy \\"Squirrel\\" Gandolf has been on death row for ten years, convicted of a heinous triple homicide. His last appeal has been denied and the state Court of Appeals has enlisted corporate attorney, Arthur Raven to review the case and make sure that nothing has been missed before setting an execution date.<br /><br />Arthur, described in the book as a steady plowhorse rather than a flashy racehorse, is a dull but standup guy who has a mentally disturbed older sister and is a bachelor in his late thirties or early forties.<br /><br />Arthur has better things to do but he begrudgingly reviews the case along with his pretty young assistant.<br /><br />There seems to be a paucity of inconsistencies to follow up on but there is one thing. Judge Sullivan who passed sentence on Rommy was subsequently sentenced to prison herself for taking bribes and was acknowledged to be an alcoholic.<br /><br />Recently released from prison, at their lunch appointment, Arthur realizes Gillian Sullivan is still an attractive woman, one he still has a crush on after several years but he must ask some unpleasant questions for the sake of his client.<br /><br />After getting nowhere with Gillian at lunch, she surprisingly asks to see him at his office where she gives him a letter she received from an inmate, Erno Erdai, who says he has important information regarding Rommy.<br /><br />After going to the Maximum Security Prison, Arthur hears an amazing story, that if true, completely exonerates his client but can he convince the courts. Can he convince the prosecution. Can he convince the public.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Reversible Errors shuffles back and forth from the time of the crime in 1991 and present time. Detective Larry Starczek is the arresting detective and Muriel Wynn is the prosecuting attorney.<br /><br />Reversible Errors is not a suspenseful novel. I will give nothing away by telling you that Rommy Gandolf, a mixed race, low IQ, thief is not guilty. That comes out on page ninety-six. Rather the story revolves around the battle between Starczek and Wynn to keep the defendant guilty and on track for execution and Raven's efforts with Sullivan's help to get a new trial or win Rommy's outright release.<br /><br />In addition there are romantic angles, with a broken romance between Starczek and Wynn in 1991 and a awkward budding romance between Raven and Sullivan.<br /><br />A couple problems I had with the story were related to the evidence, both initially and later. The convicting evidence was circumstantial and the case hinged mostly on Rommy's confession, this despite no history of violence and an IQ of 73. Later despite mounting evidence in favor of Rommy's innocence Wynn and especially Starczek refused to believe it. Also I had trouble following some of the colloquialisms used in some of the dialogue. This was not extensive and could fall on me as easily as the author.<br /><br />After a slow start, a Turrow trademark, the story moves along nicely. At four hundred thirty-three pages it's medium length and easy reading style makes for fast pleasant read, worthy of four stars.m a letter she received from an inmate, Erno Erdai, who says he has important information regarding Rommy.  <br /> <br />After going to the Maximum Security Prison, Arthur hears an amazing story, that if true, completely exonerates his client but can he convince the courts.

US	38622886	R28QHA1JR3Q2EO	0312958455	628100476	The Last Coyote (Harry Bosch #4)	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Early Bosch but still GREAT	Michael Connelly is fast becoming the pre-eminent Mystery/Crime novelist and rightly so. Having read all his books I can't think of anyone who I've enjoyed more consistently. Whether his main character is the endearing Detective Hieronymous (Harry)Bosch, Retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb, FBI agent Rachael Walling or none of the above, I've enjoyed every story, all fourteen of them.<br /><br />Of course my favorite main character has to be the intractable Detective Bosch, offspring of a call girl whose murder in 1961 left young Harry orphaned at the age of twelve. The Last Coyote, Connelly's fourth novel, sees Bosch, placed on indefinite leave for putting his Lieutenant's head through a plate glass window and taking advantage of his new found free time to reopen the aged cold case of his mother's murder.<br /><br />Everybody or Nobody<br /><br />As far as Harry is concerned, everybody, no matter what their station in life, gets equal treatment under the law. That's why his personal motto is \\"Everybody or Nobody\\" and he lives by that creed. Is that a coincidence, I think not. It probably goes back to his childhood and his mother's unsolved murder.<br /><br />Harry's Mother's name was Marjorie Lowe. After receiving a card five years previously from Marjorie's best friend, Merideth Roman, Harry pulled the murder file to try to reopen the case but he wasn't yet ready emotionally. So now he decided to try again. He had plenty of time between the three weekly visits to Carmen Hinojos, the departments anger management consultant (shrink), so he decided to give it another go. This time Harry got far enough into the murder book to decide that as he suspected, the investigation was whitewashed and some V.I.P.s were involved. Harry discovers Marjorie was seeing Arlo Conklin a former DA. Also possibly involved was Gordan Mittel, Conklin's former aid and now political kingmaker.<br /><br />Harry has plenty of time but he has no authority and no gun, so when he starts nosing around it disturbs some people. He is still angry at Harvey Pounds, his lieutenant and he needs a badge so he steals Pound's, on the sly. He also throws Pounds name around and this turns out to be a mistake, as it ends badly.<br /><br />Harry's an endearing character but he's certainly not delicate. Sometimes his investigating style is like a bull in a china shop. He gets results but some dishes get broken. In this case Harry's investigation leads to a couple more murders and almost Harry's demise. But let me tell you, I found the ending to be most surprising, even the second time around. If you can guess the ending before he gives it to you in the last fifteen or so pages, you're a better sleuth than me and I'm pretty good.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Bosch is a complex character who doesn't even seem to know himself. On one hand he is a resolutely honorable human being while being both difficult and uncompromising. This dichotomy is not appreciated among his superiors but because he is a extremely competent at his job, they cut him some slack. I think he is so popular a character because many of his readers identify with him in his travails against both bad guys, unfairness and bureaucracies.<br /><br />Author Michael Connelly is/was a crime reporter for the LA Times for years, which seems to give him a special insight into the world of crime and crime fighters, which is evident in his books. Having been a writer before an author also gives him a concise, economical, smooth writing style that is user friendly, which this reader appreciates. I just finished reading this book for the second time - actually the first time was an audio book - and I'm still amazed how Connelly can jerk the reader around, in a good sense, continuously making the reader guess the wrong bad guy and the wrong outcome.

Only his idea wasn't really artificial. He proposed to the President his concept, where he would develop a super powerful MRI machine and use it to map the human brain and insert it as the controling device in a new ultra powerful computer. It was sold to the President as a new super weapon which would make our forces invincible and that other countries were working on AI and we had better be the first. (I never could figure out how this would fit in as a weapon) The President authorized the project but seeing a potential conflict with the creation of Artificial Life insisted on placing an Ethicist (Tennant)on the project.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />The Chief Physicist Andrew Fielding died in minutes of a massive stroke. Dr Tennant, also an Internist, witnessed his friend Fielding's death and knew it was murder and if it was, he was next. Together they had made the powers that be unhappy.<br /><br />He was in his office making a video recording to give to his attorney, to be released in case of his death, when Rachael Weiss came to his office. He had missed several appointments, so she came to his office to find out why.<br /><br />Fearing for both of them, he implored her to leave with him so he could explain but they have to be very careful, the walls and virtually everything else has ears.<br /><br />Geli Bauer is disgusted that Godin and Skow did not let her kill Tennant as well as Fielding. As she saw it there were two distinct threats to the Project and gettng rid of one leaves one and now he's left with his shrink. She would have to increase surveillance on him and as soon as she gets the word she would send her favorite pit bull, a German named Ritter, who was also her lover after them.<br /><br />It should be explained that Dr Weiss was treating Dr Tennant for Narcolepsy, a condition he inherited after being scanned by the new super MRI. Accompanying these bouts are dreams, sometimes prescient and sometimes memories from a distant past. Tennant and the four other major researchers have been scanned and all have received some form of side effects, though each has a different side effect.<br /><br />After Dr. Tennant wakes up after one of his episodes and finds Ritter about to shoot Dr. Weiss, he shoots and kills Ritter. Dr. Weiss who thought Tennant's story was insane now must give credulity to their predicament.<br /><br />Hence we enter a period or hide and chase across the East coast, even going to Israel and ending in White Sands, New Mexico.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />If you have never heard of Greg Iles or read one of his books, I find him to be one of the best novelists around. His writing style is fluid and direct with an economy of words which is good, as Ile's plots tend to be involved and lengthly. Even so his books tend to run between five and seven hundred pages. This book at 578 pages is one of his average length novels.<br /><br />With that said, I did not find this book to be up to his high standards. As usual the structure and delivery of the story were fine. Also I had no problem with character development, though it could have been done better.<br /><br />The problem I had was with the premise of the book. I thought it was a little contrived and simple, not well thought out. I thought the idea of being able to recreate ones brain with the use or even a super Magnetic Resonating Machine a bit absurd. MRI's take pictures. Even in layers as the indicated way it was done, I don't see how it could transfer the essence of thought. To me it would be like trying to clone a person from a photo.<br /><br />I also thought the ending was weak if not silly, plus some really weird scientific concepts of the Universe and God are put forth in the story.<br /><br />That being said if you are willing to go along with the things that were a problem for me, you may find the book enjoyable. Heck, I found the book enjoyable for it does keep you guessing and the action is fast and furious.

US	38622886	R19A4B8ULLQ6J4	0553802496	471304969	Odd Thomas	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Odd but Oh So Clever!	I just finished Odd Thomas and I got to tell you the book was well named. In fact not just the protagonist 'Odd Thomas' (his name) was odd, the whole story was odd, in a Stephen King sort of way. That's not to detract from Mr.Koontz who is a fine writer but I couldn't help but feel a King influence in this story albeit with the benefit of Koontz's more consistent writing. Whatever, influence King had on Koontz, to me, is a moot point for Odd Thomas was a wonderful, infectious read, better in it's way than most of King's books<br /><br /> The Plot<br /><br /> Typical Good versus Evil and in this case, Malevolent parties are preparing to strike a major blow in the fictional small city/large town of Pico Mundo located in the Central Valley, Mojave Desert area of California. However Pico Mundo has a wild card and his name is Odd Thomas.<br /><br /> Odd Thomas is a twenty year old fry cook extraordinaire at the local cafe called the Grill. In addition he has a gift or curse, depending on how you look at it. Odd can see ghosts/spirits or whatever you want to call them. He can also sense danger and in some cases he is prescient through his dreams. I addition to his ability to see spirits, Odd can also see Bodachs, black apparitions of no substance that seem to congregate at places of human pain, suffering and agony. These are ominous creatures that Odd has no idea where they come from or what they are but when he sees them, he knows that something bad has happened or is about to happen.<br /><br /> The Story<br /><br /> Odd is a humble, likable, not particularly ambitious fellow but he's also an oddity with his special gifts and only a few of his closest friends know about his paranormal abilities. This cadre consist of his girlfriend Stormy, the Grill owner, Terri, Police Chief Porter and the eccentric, reclusive, obese, book writer, Little Ozzie who at 5'8&quot; and over four hundred pounds is far from little. Odd, whose useless parents are living, is like a surrogate son to Chief Porter and Odd has helped the Chief clear up some crimes a time or two. In fact this very morning, with the help of a victim's Ghost and no one else, Odd apprehends the girls murderer.<br /><br /> This same day, as he is doing his fry cook thing, he also notices a creepy looking guy, whom Odd dubs Fungus Man. While Fungus Man, who later turns out to be Bob Robertson, is seated at the counter, several Bodachs come up to and hang around, eventually leaving with him.<br /><br /> This is portentous, for Bodachs, who seem to be visible to no one else except Odd, are attracted to tragedies, the more cataclysmic, the more Bodach observers. Later as Odd is waiting for Stormy, the love of his life to get off work from her job at an ice cream store, He notices Fungus Man, again followed by Bodachs, exiting the store with a couple pints of ice cream, so Odd decides to follow him.<br /><br /> Fungus Man heads for his house where he stays for only a few moments, giving Odd the opportunity to search the house. What he encounters there is so strange, it almost defies description. He also discovers that Fungus Man's idols are serial and mass murderers and that he is a mass murderer wannabe and furthermore tomorrow is the scheduled day of infamy.<br /><br /> Conclusion<br /><br /> I must admit, once I got into this book, I found it to be an intriguing read as good as some of Koontz's best. Koontz did not meander too much on details as he did in previous novels and the writing was crisp and fresh (sounds like a salad, doesn't it?). Well it was, plus Koontz seems to be perfecting a humorous side as he had me chucking out loud on more than one occasion, like when Little Ozzie called up Odd and said his cow exploded. I won't say anything more about the humor because I don't want to spoil it for you.<br /><br /> The character development was excellent, the good guys were very good and you loved them and of course the bad guys, as Daffy Duck would say, were despicable. It should also be noted that Koontz wrote this book entirely in the first person, which means it didn't bounce around like a tennis match. The book, at just under four hundred pages, is concise and easily digested, especially for Koontz. I give Mr Koontz kudos for this one. final rating 4.5 stars.fy Duck would say, were despicable.

I haven't read a Dean Koontz authored book in a couple of years but I don't remember him being this detail oriented. My paperback copy was six hundred and eighty-one pages. Enough already, this story could have easily been told in half that many pages. In bold type too!<br />That's not to say it wasn't an interesting story. It was. I guess you might say I enjoyed it despite itself. There is no doubt Koontz is one of the better story tellers around and this was a good yarn. Trouble is I read through five hundred pages of tedium to get to one hundred and eighty pages of knock down drag out excitement and that's the part I can't tell you about. So let's talk about what I can tell you about.<br />Dean Koontz's M.O. is that he writes very good horror and science fiction horror stories not unlike the other guy whose name also starts with K, only Koontz is less erratic.<br />With the other K, you get a good one, then an bad one, then an average one then a great one and so forth. Koontz doesn't quite get to the great threshold very often but he also stays to the left of average as well.<br />Main Characters:<br />Da good guys<br />Curtis Hammond - a ten year old boy (or is he?)<br />Leilani Klonk - a precocious, handicapped nine year old girl<br />Mickey Bellsong - A pretty twenty something ex-con (she was framed)<br />Aunt Geneva - Mickey's aunt<br />\\"Old Yeller\\" - dog who tags along with Curtis<br />Noah Farrel - semi retired private eye<br />Polly and Cass - beautiful, buxom former show girls.<br />Da crumbs<br />\\"Ole Sinsemilla\\" - Leilani's good for nothing drugged out mother<br />Preston Maddoc - Leilani's evil stepdad, whom she calls \\"Dr Doom\\".<br />Da yarn<br />Mickey and Geneva's new but temporary neighbor, nine year old Leilani is smart as a whip (who ever thought up that expression?), Cute as a button (another one, never saw a cute button yet) and sharp as a tack (ok, that one fits) but she is also handicapped, with a deformed left hand and leg (she wears a leg brace) and she obviously fabricates stories, saying her mother is an insane druggie and her step father has murdered eleven people that she knows about, including her severely handicapped year older brother. It seems that Dr Doom is a sort of Dr Korvorkian but worse, an advocate of mercy killings and more. Like killing his version of the misfits and Leilani falls in his version.<br />Yes, tall tales indeed, until Mickey get a taste of the utterly bizarre behavior of Leilani's mother \\"ole Sinsemilla\\" dancing in the moonlight and then jumping down Mickey's throat for calling her Sinsemilla. At this point Leilani's tall tale seems a lot shorter and after that and a couple other episodes, Mickey and Geneva are quite worried not only for Leilani's welfare but indeed for her life.<br />Curtis Hammond is running for his life. There is something evil after him, worse than evil, malevolent and it's closing in. In Utah, after visiting a sleeping families house to find clothes and food, the family dog trails after Curtis as he makes a hasty get away after the evil almost catches him. It seems, what is after Curtis has already killed his mother and now they're killing this Utah family, so not only is Curtis in danger but so is anyone he contacts.<br />And so on goes the story where our divergent characters, good and bad alike, are inexorably drawn to a confluence in a small town in the Idaho panhandle.<br />Conclusion<br />Dean Koontz seems to come up with unusual and original plots and he tells the story well with an open easy to follow writing style. Likewise One Door Away From Heaven is a well presented clever story in Koontz's classic Good versus Evil motif. His depiction of the characters, especially Leilani was excellent. He made you want to adopt her and similarly with Curtis, however this book is not without some faults.<br />The effort that Koontz put forth was overly loquacious and there was much too much attention paid to detail. An example that comes to mind is whereCurtis goes into a truck stop bathroom. This bathroom, which has no real bearing on the story is described in such detail that some 140 words are used. I felt this excess of description turned a rather simple straight forward novel into a wordy complex story that, as I mentioned, bordered on tedium, not to mention the additional two or three hundred pages took me an extra five or six hours to read.<br />I have read many Koontz books, Coldfire, Hideaway, Tick Tock, Strange Highways, Lightning and others and I don't remember Koontz's writing being so distracting. It almost seems like Koontz supplied a plot and someone else wrote the book.<br />Regardless, the plot and story were interesting enough despite the overdone presentation to salvage the book.Curtis goes into a truck stop bathroom.

Paul Wilson, in the early eighties, it was the quasi Vampire novel, The Keep. Although the antagonist of that book wasn't truly a Vampire, The Keep read like a vampire novel.(and a very good one at that)<br />Well Wilson decided he would write another Vampire novel and Midnight Mass is the result of that endeavor. Now Wilson thinks there aren't any redeeming qualities in Vampires, citing the fact that some authors romanticize even glorify the bloodsuckers in their recitals. With that in mind Wilson has written a book about Vampires as the merciless, venal, malevolent creatures they are supposed to be.<br />MIDNIGHT MASS<br />Plot<br />They came out of the East, starting shortly after the fall of the Iron Curtain. They were unstoppable overrunning country after country killing millions, no billions or converting people into nocturnal monsters. Now they were entrenched in the East coast of America. They had a method, convert the religious and secular leadership, convert them and make resistance seem hopeless, they had a plan, transform all humans at first to a point of saturation, then using them only as food or breeding, harvesting at will. The Vampires also had allies, they left some of the lowlives and dreck alive to watch over them and seek out new victims during daylight, this unholy vanguard are called the &quot;cowboys but, the Vampires the have a vulnerability.<br />The Story<br />The Vampires certainly seem invincible but in a small New Jersey town an unlikely cadre of citizens are fighting back, a pinprick at first but gradually a ripple. Meet Father Joe - a disgraced priest, Sister Carole - a one woman vigilante, Rabbi Zev - a rabbi with a cross, and Lacey - the feisty niece of Father Joe. Together and with the help of the congregation, they take back Father Joe's church, St Anthony, which the vampires, and cowboys, had taken over and made into a grisly, macabre, killing Temple.<br />In addition cowboys are being killed and displayed upside down from trees or telephone poles and even a couple Vampires including one of the strongest has been dispatched<br />In the overall plan of the Vampires, this little rebellion seems insignificant but they thrive on fear and no dissension can be tolerated, so help is sent from New York Vampire headquarters to stem the unrest.<br />Conclusion<br />I'll admit I'm a little ambivalent about Midnight Mass. F. Paul Wilson is one of probably my three or four favorite authors. I have read every book he has written including the inscrutable end of the Adversary series, Nightworld - which is mysteriously not in publication - so I tend to be favorably inclined toward the good doctor but I do have some issues with this book.<br />Good<br />The Wilson writing style is still there, so the story is very accessible and understandable. His writing is also fluid and a pleasure to read. There are no unnecessary use of large words which the average Joe would have to look up. The story as a whole flows well and is fast paced. The book itself, at three hundred and thirty-two pages is short in this day and age of word processing and there are no dead or boring chapters.<br />Bad<br />Where I thought the book fell short was the premise of the book itself. I found it a little incredulous why or how legions of malevolent creatures would descend on the West from the East, as Gengis Khan or Tamerlane did centuries prior, merely because of the collapse of the Soviet Empire.<br />There was no explanation of how this event precipitated such an invasion nor of what was keeping them from doing so sooner. It was like they were hibernating or metamophosing. Any reasonable explanation would have been welcome.<br />Another thing I didn't like was, the Vampires were ruthless, yet their servants, the cowboys, from whom they depended on for daytime protection, seemed less than efficient, in some cases screw ups.<br />Overall<br />First, this is a good book and if you can discount my aversionto origin of the plot, I think you might like Midnight Mass. No it's not a classic but it is enjoyable, nonetheless, for fans of tongue in cheek horror plus a sequel may be forthcoming. I found the book to be innovative and the Vampires vulnerability well thought out. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, therefore it is deserving of a Final Rating of low four stars / high three stars rounded to four stars because of the author.scount my aversion to origin of the plot, I think you might like Midnight Mass.

You see with Crichton's scary novels you can't keep reminding yourself that there isn't any such thing as Werewolves or Demon's or Ghosts or Zombies and especially Vampires. No, unfortunately his scary novels are based in Science and it's hard to say in this day and age of scientific miracles that there is no such thing as Science. Prey is such a novel.<br />PREY<br />Prey starts innocently enough with our main character Jack Forman being an unemployed Mr Mom to twelve year old Nicole, eight year old Eric and eight month old Amanda. It seems Jack, who was a Program Dept. Supervisor at MediaTronics INC. was also put in charge of security after his dept. discovered a pirated version of one of their softwares was being sold overseas.<br />This led, in the course of his investigations, to discovering his boss was involved in the theft and other things. Refusing to ignore these transgressions he informed a stockholder, who was involved with his boss and so six months previously Jack was unceremoniously dumped and blackballed.<br />Luckily, Jacks wife of fourteen years, Julia, is on the fast track at Xymos, another computer company and heavily involved in the development of a new groundbreaking molecular technology. In fact she's so busy that she's hardly ever around and when she is, she acts odd and disagreeable. After thinking about it and noticing that she's lost weight and dressing less businesslike and more seductive, Jack decides Julia's having an affair.<br />What is making Julia act so strange, so tense, so driven, and what made the baby red all over and so sick that she had to be rushed to the Emergency Room at the Hospital? And why did the baby's symptoms suddenly disappear when she underwent an MRI test and what was that crazy dream where Julia got in bed one night and turned all black like a cloak had been pulled over her, or was it a dream? Also what caused Julia to get in a car accident shortly after leaving the house after dinner and why when Jack was riding in the ambulance to the hospital did Julia make him promise to stay away from the Xymos project? Is she really having an affair? Jack's got to see what's going on!<br />Too bad that it's not the case. An affair would be mild compared to the mess Jack discovers at Xymos's secret Tonopah, Nevada plant shortly after he is hired as a consultant. Something is out of control, it's deadly, a threat to all mankind and it's up to Jack to stop it.<br />Conclusion<br />Michael Crichton has some of the most varied a unusual plots of any of my preferred writers. From the space borne disease in Andromeda Strain, to the tenth century, homicidal creatures of Eaters of the Dead, to the resurrected Dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and more, his stories are all over the place. Crichton's writing style and his ability to spin a yarn are impeccable, until Prey that is.<br />No, he still spins a good fast paced yarn, truly based on Science and that is where Crichton falters a little. In an effort to scientifically back up his story he goes into way too much detail on the scientific background of the elements of the story. True we are dealing with scientists and technicians but most of the readers are lay people. It wasn't overdone but the story would have flowed better if Crichton would have treated the book more as the novel it is.at crazy dream where Julia got in bed one night and turned all black like a cloak had been pulled over her, or was it a dream?

In fact in this book we deal with the heart of the Catholic Church in the Vatican itself. As with The Da Vinci Code the premise of the book has to do with a long time alleged enemy of the Catholic Church. This time it is the &quot;Illuminati&quot;.<br />Illuminati<br />An esoteric society of scientists and artisans of which Gallileo was a founding member. Formed in the sixteen hundreds, its members were ostensibly persecuted, hunted and even murdered by the Catholic Church, as at the time the church believed science was incompatible with church dogma. Illuminati were rumored to have eventually mainstreamed and infiltrated, banking establishments, industry, governments and the Masons. They were thought to be defunct for a generation.<br />A scientist at the world's foremost scientific research facility CERN, has been murdered. In addition he has been branded with an ambigram (meaning reading the same upside down) spelling out the word ILLUMINATI. Later discovered is that the product of the project the murdered scientist, Leonardo Vetra, was working on (anti-matter)is missing, stolen from a secure location. Gram for gram it is the most powerful substance on Earth and it is in the hands of an underground with a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church.<br />Robert Langdon is awakened at five in the morning by a strange man who says he needs to come to his lab ASAP.<br />Thinking the guy is a crackpot Langdon hangs up and tries to go back to bed but then his fax machine starts to receive a message. Curious he retrieves the facsimile and is shocked by what it contains. Still stunned, he finally realized the sender was still on the line wanting to talk so he picked up the line.<br />A short time later Langdon is on a mach fifteen plane to Geneva, Switzerland and a date with destiny.<br />Wheelbound Director of CERN, Maximillian Kohler, called Langdon because he was listed on the internet as an expert on Illuminati, having written a book, &quot;The Art of the Illuminati&quot;. It seems the Illuminati a longtime blood enemy of Chritianity in general and especially Catholicism has stolen something which, if removed from the protective environs of CERN for twenty-four hours, will explode with a force greater than a nuclear bomb.<br />After meeting the lovely but distraught daughter of the murder victim, Vittoria, also a scientist then discovering the missing anti-matter, Kohlers secretary finally locates him and says the Vatican has been desperately trying to get ahold of him. They want to know what a canister with CERN's logo and apparently counting down is doing in some unknown location in the Vatican, what it is and how it got there.<br />I'll bet you want to know too. I know I did.<br />Angels and Demons has so much action and suspense that it had me mesmerized after sixty or seventy pages. It is certainly not a simple story. The story is involved, complex and convoluted and it is told with finesse in a writing style that is quite easy to follow. Unlike The Da Vinci Code, this story comes together wonderfully, doesn't drag and is fully believable. The character development was great as was some tricky misdirection. It seems like it ends several times and to Brown's credit each probable ending is better than the last.<br />In a nutshell, if you liked The Da Vinci Code, I don't see how you could not like Angels and Demons.<br />Final rating: 4.75 starshe was listed on the internet as an expert on Illuminati, having written a book, &quot;The Art of the Illuminati&quot;.

US	38622886	R4AAKV22AGV0B	0452283779	663337946	Price of Honor: Muslim Women Lift the Veil of Silence on the Islamic World	Books	5	41	51	N	Y	Muslim Women - The Truly Downtrodden of the World	While women can be mistreated by individuals in any society, Islam, at least extreme Islam, sanctifies the systemic abuse of all women.<br />\\"A man loves first his son, then his camel, and then his wife\\"<br />Arab Proverb<br />This book, written in 1995 by Jan Goodwin, describes the sometimes gruesome position many women find themselves in just by living in many predominantly Muslim countries. It lays out a theory wherein the rising popularity of militant, extreme, Fundamentalist Islam is the main reason for the deterioration of the rights of Muslim women, as these Islamists increase they're power base at the expense of women's rights. Goodwin goes on to say that there is little or no basis in the Koran (the Islamic Holy Book) for the deteriorating position of women in many Muslim countries. The scope of women's disenfranchisement varies from mild to severe from country to country as Goodwin addresses conditions in the ten countries she visited. It also varies according to the beliefs of branch of Islam to which the woman's family belongs, Fundamentalist being the most oppressive. She also describes how this creeping tide of militant fundamentalist Islam in a danger to mainstream Islam and moderate Muslims. Though life in moderate or mainstream Muslim societies is very hard on most women it borders on slavery under extreme societies.<br />\\"There is no fun in Islam\\"<br />Ayatollah Khomeini<br />In the Peoples Islamic Republic of Iran, Khomeini lowered the marriage age for females from eighteen to thirteen (ya hear that Jerry Lee), but permitted girls as young as nine, even seven in some cases to be married if a physician signs a certificate agreeing to their sexual maturity. (pedophilia heaven). However, to the Ayatollah's credit, he drew the line at seven, stating that it is forbidden to have sex with girls under seven!<br />\\"If a man and woman are alone in one place, the third person present is the devil\\"<br />Prophet Mohammad<br />\\"Under the law as it stands in Pakistan, women who have been raped can be charged with adultery or fornication. The proof required for zina (sex outside of wedlock including rape) is that there be four Muslim adult males of \\"good repute\\" present who can attest to the act of sexual penetration. No male witnesses of good repute, of course, are likely to stand and watch a rape in progress without trying to stop it. And because of this requirement it becomes impossible to punish the rapists. Instead the victim is prosecuted. Her legal complaint of rape is considered a confession of illicit sexual intercourse.\\"<br />\\"The majority of Muslim women find their lives controlled by their closest male relative. They are the daughters whose future marriage partners continue to be determined by their fathers. They are the brides who must be virgins on their wedding nights in a culture where, if they are not, honor killings are common and often carried out by the girls own brothers\\"<br />Muslim Irony<br />Fundamentalists restrict women from working, leaving the house unescorted and unveiled, being clergy, driving, reading the Koran, marrying an infidel, going to school after the sixth grade if at all and more.<br />The Irony of this treatment is in this Quote: \\"Such restrictions on women are necessary. They are to protect women's honor and they are also a symbol of our enormous respect for women\\"<br />CONCLUSION<br />This book and several others like it document the ugly, onerous, abhorrent living conditions perpetrated on many Muslim women by Muslim men in the name of Islam. In fairness, The Author has on numerous occasion stated there is no basis for this treatment in the tenets of Islam. In Islam, especially the fundamentalist version religion is power. The Clergy gain power by elevating their male adherents, as do the adherents, over the females. They also gain power by espousing enmity toward a common enemy as Khomeni did toward the U.S. This is the politics of Theocrats. (The last three sentences are my observations)<br />As for the book, I highly recommend it. It's 358 pages is well written, easy to read, compelling and chuck full of insights. The author, Jan Goodwin, did a tremendous amount of research, visiting and living in some ten countries, interviewing hundreds of, sometimes shy and reluctant, women to publish this very comprehensive book. Many of these women gave interviews, even though it endangered them. A couple observations I came away with is that the exception of Saudi Arabia, the holy seat of Islam, the quality of women's living conditions increased with the wealth of the country or in large countries the area. Also it seemed to me that for the average Muslim male, appearances took precedence over the welfare of his womenfolk.<br />There are so many other things I would like to bring out, like how many Muslim women are malnourished by getting only leftovers, while doing three times the work of her counterpart but you really need to read the book.my observations) <br />As for the book, I highly recommend it.

An impressive name but a somewhat pretentious book. The author is a world renown authority on the Ottoman Empire in particular and Islam and the near east in general.<br /><br />For a non fiction book written by a scholar the, writing is easily understandable and interesting, a combination I find is sometimes lacking in scholarly publications, however, at 164 pages, The Crisis of Islam is a short book and it pretty much rehashes material from previous books<br /><br />After reviewing a short history of Islam, Lewis proceeds to tell us what he thinks are the problems facing the Islamic religion and how these problems affect mainstream and fundamentalist Muslims and skews their view of the west, especially America, which according to Lewis, is viewed as an extension of The Byzantine and The Holy Roman Empires. A bit of a stretch to me.<br /><br />While Moslems feel their religion is superior to other religions, most notably, Christianity and Judaism, they also believe they are morally superior as well and with some justification, however, in a free society such as ours you will have everything from rabid Christian Fundamentalists to criminals with most people in the middle. Having never experienced a free society, the rank and file Muslim cannot possibly understand the concept.<br /><br />It seems endless, the list of human rights and other humanity issues that Islamists justify in the name of religion. Oh we did that, it was Gods will. Oh, that was because Allah willed it. When Islamic hordes raced across Africa and Asia it was not to conquer but to spread the word of the Islamic God and in their minds, it probably was. All the lands they conquered around the Mediterranean Sea were Christian lands but when Christians took back or came back as protectorates, they were imperialists and colonialists.<br /><br />Among other things, they call America to task for having allowed slavery in our country, while conveniently forgetting the substantial Arab contribution to the slave trade, not counting having slaves into the sixties.<br /><br />What this seems to boil down to is that Moslems are not responsible for anything. If something good happens it's Allah's will, if something happens that they don't like, it's the Wests and specifically America's and of course Israel's fault. Accountability seems to be missing from the Arabic and Farsi dictionaries. Apparently they have no control over their own lives.<br /><br />Lewis brings up the point that while democracy will work with Islam, Islam, will not work with with democracy. What he means, is that Islamists, especially fundamentalists, view democracy as a vehicle to power that once achieved can be dispensed with. The rationalization is that once fundamentalists are elected and establish a religious government, they are implementing Gods law and that trumps any law of man. We have seen this in Iran where a Theocracy was elected, whereupon it enacted laws to perpetuate their power base and diminish that of reformers.<br /><br />Another excellent point alluded to by Lewis is that, in many cases, these peoples religion has been around a lot longer than their their countries and therefore boundaries and nationhood, don't mean that much to the average Muslim, while their religion is all important. Westerners feel pride and kinship with their countrymen. Muslims feel pride and kinship with other Muslims of all nationalities. That is why they are so personally involved in the Palestinian issue.<br /><br />I don't think it's any secret that many Muslims, especially Fundamentalist Muslims have been brainwashed. They go to private Islamic Schools, called Madrasas, where they study nothing but the Koran and where in many schools they hear unending diatribes about the evils of the West and America especially.<br /><br />While Muslims think their religion is far superior, they recognize that their society has become backward. It makes them feel outgunned and angry. As we discussed previously, the Muslims are not very good at introspection. To them what is obviously a flawed society, somehow, has been caused by the unbridled success of the west.<br /><br />After 9-11, we got to see and hear numerous high ranking Moslems on T.V. tell us how terrorism, at least upon non-combatants is strictly against Islam.<br /><br />Dr Lewis seems to confirm this in this book, stating categorically, that nothing is contained within the pages of the Koran that would either specify, nor condone such behavior. He further states that the suicide bomber phenomenon is directly contrary to the Koran and that suicide is such a sin that it will keep you out of heaven, no matter how righteous you've been.<br /><br />Nevertheless, extremists, such as bin Laden, have managed to find plenty adherents for their convoluted view of Islam and somehow contravened the prohibition against suicide.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />As much as I would like to ignore the Muslims and their myriad of self made problems, I'm afraid for us to ignore the extremist Muslim threat would, for us, be a form of our own suicide. The extremist nuts have indeed found a cause to keep them occupied, and it is US! Should we once again stick our heads in the sand, I'm afraid our posteriors would get burned.<br /><br />What can we do? I'm not sure but whatever we do is going to take a long, long time. It took us seventy years to defeat communism, so we better be prepared for the long haul.<br /><br />Iraq might be a good start if we can pull it off, getting an appreciative citizenry there. However, many Iraqi's have already forgot how much they dreaded and hated Saddam and are now directing their wrath at us. A classic case of what have you done for me lately.<br /><br />Starting a gradual push for women's rights seems like a good idea, and putting pressure on various friendly governments to shut down or at least change the curriculum of the Madrasas, would seem prudent, since most terrorists started there.<br /><br />What we really need to do, is see if we can make life for the average poor Muslim more tolerable. If their government isn't beating them down, their religion is suffocating them. The suicide bombers are most likely brainwashed and probably drugged but I wouldn't be surprised if some of them didn't find the idea of controlling something, maybe for the first time in their life, a little intoxicating, Even if it is only their own death.lawed society, somehow, has been caused by the unbridled success of the west.

What we really need to do, is see if we can make life for the average poor Muslim more tolerable. If their government isn't beating them down, their religion is suffocating them. The suicide bombers are most likely brainwashed and probably drugged but I wouldn't be surprised if some of them didn't find the idea of controlling something, maybe for the first time in their life, a little intoxicating, Even if it is only their own death.	2004-05-30

Nick and Trevor are pubescent twelve year olds, inseparable, fast friends for years from the town of Elk River Montana. They horse around, play tricks on each other, disparage each other in fun and are two thoroughly enjoyable characters.<br />One weekend in May, shortly before summer, the boys take a ride on their bikes to the Elk River. It seems the winter runoff that spring was severe, causing widespread flooding and tremendous damage and now that the flood waters have finally receded, our boys are off to explore the damage.<br />The flood caused extreme erosion of the river bank and our explorers discovered a partially exposed crate in the side of the bank. Unfortunately it was lodged rather high but our tenacious duo finally managed, after concerted efforts to pull a portion of the crate loose as they fell. What they discovered in the portion that came out with their fall both intrigued and revolted Nick and Trevor. There were some old hippie style clothes, some jewelry and bones and a SKULL. Human bones and skull. What have they found?<br />In addition to skeleton and clothes, they found a bracelet, which Trevor wanted to give to Wendy Buckwalter, a girl in his class that Trevor has a crush on and an old hippie headband. Since Trevor wants the bracelet, he insists that Nick keep the headband and places it upon Nick's head and when he does Nick suddenly feels very strange, &quot;like he is being propelled through a vacuum of air at the speed of light&quot;, all of a sudden Nick finds himself in an automobile in the presence of a dark haired girl who trying to beat him off(no not that way). She finally breaks free and make a run for it and Nick chases after her, catches her and strikes her with his flashlight. At this point, Nick, wakes up to a bemused, scared Trevor. It seems Nick was in a trance and his nose even started to bleed. This went on until the headband, while Trevor was shaking him, was flung free.<br />Thus, begins an odyssey in which the boys, after reporting the body, first to their parents and then to the authorities, with the help of the miraculous headband, start a parallel investigation and eventually bring the lovely Wendy Buckwalter in the fold to help out. It seems there was a series of pretty young women disappearing, five in all, around 1975 none of which were ever found but there are those who notice the boys inquisitions. Those who would rather let sleeping dogs lie.<br />What follows is a period of harassment that began as a warning then brutality at the hands of the insufferable Sheriff's Deputy, Dwight. This pattern continues and escalates to a point where the boys and Wendy's very lives are in danger.<br />At this point the trio decide to carry on their investigation in a surreptitious manner but events start to move so fast and out of control that our heroes ultimately find themselves in what appears to be untenable situation.<br />Conclusion<br />The whole time I was reading Divine Witness I felt a familiarity with the writing style. Upon further examination I decided that our book has a similar writing style with J.K. Rowling. My wife, who is a Harry Potter fanatic agreed. There's nothing pretentious in the writing style, like say Dean Koontz, who's always trying to show you how smart he is and constantly going off on tangents and loosing the reader(though I like Koontz, I'm agonizing through one of his books right now).<br />Why I feel a similarity with Rowling's writing I'm not sure. Perhaps it's because the book moved right along, resisting the urge to get lost in details or maybe because it's written for the average person and with a paucity of four and five syllable words but most likely it's because the book seems to be directed toward a young audience.<br />No, Ryan Seek's book is for people, not readers. He brings Nick and Trevor, along with Wendy, to life and gives them substance. Nick's Donna Reed style homemaker mother and Trevors' tough no nonsense father also are likeable characters. Likewise it's hard not to despise the somewhat inept, dimwitted but thoroughly nasty antagonist, Deputy Dwight. I can picture a thirteen year old, with one caveat, (There is some playful bantering and other profanities) or a seventy year old or anyone in between reading and enjoying this book.tough no nonsense father also are likeable characters.

US	38622886	R3HMO96WU180IE	0765340771	936885917	Dune: The Butlerian Jihad: Book One of the Legends of Dune Trilogy	Books	5	3	6	N	Y	Dune minus Ten Thousand Years	The Butlerian Jihad is the first installment of a trilogy, a prequel of sorts ostensibly based on the notes and writings of Frank Herbert.<br />For those of you that don't know, The Butlerian Jihad takes place ten thousand years before the time of originator Frank Herberts immensely popular book, Dune. It is a collaboration between Brian Herbert (Frank's son)and Kevin Anderson. It is the forth book co-written by these authors that I know of, having just finished another trilogy/prequel, The House series (House Atriedes, Harkonnen and Corrin).<br />Unlike some other reviewers, I found The Butlerian Jihad to be an exceptional book. I believe it to be Herbert/Anderson's most accomplished manuscript. I finally got to experience the past which was vaguely alluded to in Dune.<br />We get to meet the beautiful, compassionate Serena Butler, who's son, the murder of which, set off the rebellion, which eventually brought down the heartless thinking machines. We also meet distant relatives of Baron Harkonnen - Xavier (who is a good and honorable person) and Paul Atriedes - Vorian (the son of the wicked Titan, Agamemnon {a thousand year old human brain in a robot body})and Tio Holtzman (the revered inventor of the Holtzman Effect and other inventions). We experience the last stronghold of free humanity, with The League of Nobles, the fledgling exportation of the spice Melange from Arrakis and the precursor of the Bene Gesserit, in the Sorceress's of Rossak.<br />As with the original Dune, the authors create numerous civilizations in a Universe dwelling on millions of planets and then embellish it with devious evil characters and their requisite counterpoints. It may be ten thousand years in the past from Dune but they are everybit as advanced to us, as we are to Neanderthals.<br />I found this book, consisting of 695 pages, to be an enthralling read. True, the chapters are numerous and short but the story is huge so it couldn't be overly detailed, or the book would have been unwieldy. We are, after all, talking about a Universal Epic in which the authors followed about fifteen main characters on six different planets and in space. As with Dune we are treated to an excellent page turning science fiction novel with religious undertones.en unwieldy.

The third book in as many months has just been released and although it's based on 3 1/2 hours of interviews with Bush himself, along with 3 hours with Rumsfield and interviews with seventy-five other administration members, most of whom remain anonymous, it fails to expiate the Bush Administration.<br />\\"Plan of Attack\\" is, as it's title infers, a book that outlines the basis for planning and carrying out the attack and occupation of Iraq, which started a mere 72 days after Sept. 11th and was funded by money earmarked for Afganistan. If the book is to be believed, and I'm a believer, the war on Iraq is a misadventure of the highest magnitude. According to the book, The war strategy started out as a two pronged initiative, diplomacy with the threat of war, a war which came about due to inertia.<br />Woodward claims that Vice President Dick Cheny was the driving force behind the march to war, a \\"powerful, steamrolling force\\" who pulled the Presidents strings toward a war mentality. The fact that Bush was a foreign policy novitiate allowed the hard liners such as Cheny, along with other allies who had the \\"Fever\\" such as Deputies \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Wolfowitz and Feith to mold the President to their way of thinking. Other than Secretary of State Colin Powell, who eventually caved in, the other members of the Cabinet seemed to go along for the ride.<br />Cheney, now alegedly, barely on speaking terms with Powell, is quoted as saying \\"(Powell) always had major reservations about what we were trying to do\\". WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO DICK?<br />Woodward says that Powell counseled the President against war, stating \\"you're going to own the place\\" and invoking the \\"Pottery Barn rule\\" on Iraq, \\"you break it you own it\\" but in the end, when Powell saw the President's mind was made up, he acquiesed. This was unfortunate because the support of Powell gave the President's position an aire of legitimacy, which the President himself was dubious about.<br />\\"Nice try\\" Bush said when CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin finish his presentation for their case and what would later be the administration's case for Iraqi WMD. Bush went on \\"I don't think this quite - it's not something that Joe Public would understand or would gain a lot of confidence from\\". Bush then turned to CIA Director, George Tenet and asked \\"I've been told all this intelligence about having WMD, and this is the best we've got?\\" Tenet assured Bush that weapons of mass destruction were indeed in Iraq and even said \\"It's a slam dunk\\".<br />Nevertheless GWB took us to the precipice of war and jumped. Is he dismayed that we did not find WMD? Bush claims not, you see, he now has a new mandate. \\"I believe we have a duty to free people\\"hich the President himself was dubious about.<br />\\"Nice try\\" Bush said when CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin finish his presentation for their case and what would later be the administration's case for Iraqi WMD.

It is entertaining in it's own homely way but It's certainly not the John Grisham I remember from the eighties, the Grisham that wrote the edge of your seat thrillers like The Firm and The Pelican Brief.<br />\\"A jury sentenced Danny Padgitt to life in prison. He sentenced them to death!\\"<br />Setting<br />Welcome to Clanton, Ford County, Mississippi. Grisham returns the the setting for the first book he ever wrote, Time to Kill, for his latest release, The Last Juror.<br />Meet Joyner William Traynor aka Willie Traynor. Willie, who is the narrator for this story, is a reporter for The Ford County Times, when the newspaper goes bankrupt. Having freshly graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in Journalism, Willie is in a position, with the help of his wealthy Grandmother, BeeBee, to buy the newspaper and does.<br />Plot<br />Willie is barely settling in as the Owner/Publisher/Editor etc. of his weekly publication, when the circulation is given a boost because of a particularly gruesome and violent murder of a widow named Rhoda Kassellaw. Danny Padgitt, one of the sons of a notorious, semi-legitimate clan of moonshiners and timber millers, who inhabit a nearby island, is arrested for the crime, after crashing his truck, making a getaway.<br />Sandwiched between the arrest and trial of Danny Padgitt, Willie decides to write a human interest story on a prominent local black family - the Ruffins. This remarkable family has eight children, seven of which have earned, not only college degrees but PHDs and are currently professors at various leading universities.<br />Upon their initial meeting, Miss Callie, the Ruffin family matriarch, serves Willie a scrumptious luncheon and Willie and Callie hit it off wonderfully and become fast friends. Later Callie is the Last Juror chosen for the Padgitt murder trial and thereupon sets history as the first Negro juror in Mississippi history.<br />The Trial<br />All the evidence points to Danny's guilt and even though he threatened to get the twelve jurors, if they find him guilty, (including Willie's newfound friend Callie Ruffin), the jury still finds him guilty.<br />Though the Juror's found Padgitt guilty of rape and murder, they cannot come to a consensus on the death penalty, so Padgitt is automatically sentenced to the alternative, Life in Prison, which at that time in Mississippi equated to ten years, less with good behavior, a fact that is withheld from juries. This angers the townfolk as they were sure that Padgitt would get the Gas Chamber. Everybody was mad but they didn't know who to be angry with, because the the jurors swore an oath to keep the vote a secret.<br />From this point forward we digress into a fairly dull albeit interesting dissertation, with a couple exceptions, about Willie's interaction in the community and how he turns a marginally profitable newspaper into a successful one.<br />The exceptions are where they try to sneak a parole hearing through for Padgitt and where Padgitt is observed in a work release program with little or no security. Our protagonist, Willie, shows up and rains on their (the Padgitt's) parade in both cases but the writing is on the wall. They are determined to get Danny Padgitt out and eventually they do.<br />Conclusion<br />I won't kid you about this book. I have very mixed feelings about what I read. On the one hand, it a warm friendly story about a fairly sleepy fictitious town and county in Mississippi, pretty much describing rural life in the South in the Seventies. And of course, Grisham has one of the best writing styles around. For this book he even added some southern homilies to make it feel more warm and fuzzy.<br />Except for the Padgitts and their sleazy lawyer, Lucien Wilbanks, the characters are likable if not lovable. The warm, lovable Callie Ruffin kept reminding me of Oprah Winfrey, though I don't know why. Other interesting individuals were Baggy, thestaff reporter, who is drunk after twelve noon, Harry Rex, a lawyer and carryover from A Time to Kill, and Wiley, the part time staff photographer.<br />Once Danny Padgitt was sent off to prison, after a third of the book, with rare exceptions it was like reading Driving Miss Daisy. Grisham described how Willie had lunch every Thursday with Callie, and the techniques Willie used to build up the Paper and how he visited each of Ford Counties eighty some Churches for service, one per week and then finally, for about the last forty pages things got suspenseful again and does not end the way you are lead to believe.<br />Again, I say this still held my interest, there was never a danger of my not finishing the book, it's just that I buy Grisham for excitement, for thrills. This was vintage Grisham, sans the thrills and intrigue. Unfortunately he's been doing that a lot lately.were Baggy, the staff reporter, who is drunk after twelve noon, Harry Rex, a lawyer and carryover from A Time to Kill, and Wiley, the part time staff photographer. <br />Once Danny Padgitt was sent off to prison, after a third of the book, with rare exceptions it was like reading Driving Miss Daisy.

Likewise with his dozen or so improbable novels.<br />This review is about my personal favorite novel from the amusingly wacky mind of Hiaasen, so if you like your mysteries with an off the wall, absurd slant, (more loony than mystery) read on.<br />The central villain of Native Tongue is Francis X. Kingsbury, he, the boorish owner of a shabby second-rate nature theme park, Amazing Kingdom of Thrills Theme Park, who, with jealous eyes, aspires to be a competitor for Disney World, and consequently, has plans to further rape the environment with an ostentatious condo development and adjoining golf-course.<br />Our protagonist, who may be a vicarious creation of our author, is Joe Winder a former journalist, who initially goes to work as a PR/Damage Control man for the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills Park. His boss Kingsbury happens to be in a government witness protection program for ratting on John Gotti.<br />Our Story starts out when a pair of Blue Tongued Mango Voles, an extremely rare endangered species, are stolen from a pavilion at the theme park. The Voles one of the park's premier exhibits strongly resemble rats with a blue tongue. Shortly thereafter a series of murder and mayhem begin and our hero is inextricably drawn in to investigate.<br />Along the way we get to see a plethora of nutty characters, starting with every Hiaasen fan's favorite, Skink, a former Governor of Florida turned eco-terrorist/hermit. Other wacky characters include, Grandma, a 70-year-old pistol packing member of the Wildlife Rescue Corps, A girlfriend who &quot;talks dirty&quot; for a living, a heavy handed gun loving Sheriff's Deputy and a young woman in a raccoon costume, not to mention Dickie the Dolphin has a helluva romp in his tank with a beautiful TV reporter and Orky the Wale, who kills the Voles doctor, which is subsequently set up like a suicide.<br />Sound like fun? It is, so I won't spoil it for you. Read the book!<br />Native Tongue was Hiassen's fourth solo novel and as with the others is set in his home state of Florida. While Hiaasen's wit is undeniable, there is an underlying agenda in his books. It is obvious that Mr. Hiassen is a conservationist and is not happy with the wanton rapid, seemingly unregulated development taking place in Florida.<br />Hiassen's writing is amazingly simple and straight forward.<br />Being an editorialist this is a man that knows how to write. His preposterous stories are so interesting that the pages just wiz by. His characters are also unbelievably interesting if not outright Wacky. For Instance the six foot five, ex-Governor Skink who Hiaasen seems to reprise in most of his novels is a beloved character, sort of like F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack. For those of you who are not familiar with Skink, it's a funny story. When he was governor his liberal conservationist programs were thwarted by the legislature at every turn. Rumor had it that he just flipped out. He did get so disgusted that he walked out of the Governorship and from time to time is spotted in the Everglades sporting a shower cap.<br />If you are in the mood for a light entertaining read I highly recommend Hiaasen, especially Native Tongues, so I won't spoil it for you.

I once read a series of six books by Wilson, called the Adversary Series. It started out with The Keep and ended with an out of print, rare book called Nightworld. Nightworld was an extraordinary book wherein the evil, reborn Rasalom, after a titanic seemingly unwinable battle and against all odds, was vanquished for once and for all, or was he?<br />With Gateways, it seems our illustrious author is leading us back to another cataclysmic clash with this maleficent character, a reprise of sorts or maybe even a reissue of Nightworld, in which Repairman Jack played a significant part. That would explain why Jack seems to have no recollection of major events that happened in a novel written ten years ago. I suppose we will have to wait and see what Wilson has in mind, so let's get to the story at hand.<br />Background on Repairman Jack<br />This is the seventh book involving, the very popular fictional character, Repairman Jack, a character that has become one of the most beloved literary creations since James Bond.<br />Repairman Jack is an unobtrusive looking guy who has slipped in under the government radar. He doesn't exist as far as the government knows. He has no social security number, no credit cards, pays no taxes, pays cash for everything always keeps a low profile.<br />Jack \\"The Equalizer\\". If you remember the TV show of that name from several years ago, that is what Jack does. No he's not \\"The Equalizer\\" but if you've been wronged and you've got the money, Jacks available and Jack can be deadly. He can be your worst nightmare but as nightmares go everything is relative and Jack takes second fiddle in this book as he fights for his and his father's life<br />Plot<br />Jack's seventy year old father, was involved in a hit and run accident and is comatose in the hospital. Jack flies down to be with him and as well as to nose around to see if he can find out what happened.<br />Well the more he finds out, the stranger things get, as Jack seems to have gotten himself involved in yet another supernatural incident involving a young woman who can control animals and older woman with somewhat magical powers.<br />When Jack finally gets to his fathers hospital room he runs into his father's neighbor, the enigmatic Anya, a mysterious seventy-something lady of surprises. She insists that Jack stay in his dad's house so they in effect are neighbors as well. While there Jack discovers that Anya is indeed more than meets the eye.<br />As Jack tries to investigate, his fathers accident many things don't add up, such as the anonymous call about the accident preceding the accident by twenty minutes. He also discovers there have been three unnatural deaths among Gateways residents about three months apart and Jacks dad may fit that pattern.<br />Eventually Jack runs into a white haired girl named Semelee, the defacto leader of a strange group of misshapen young adults called the Clan, that live in the Everglades. Semelee seems to have some advanced knowledge of Jack and also seems to be smitten with Jack, much to the chagrin of Luke, Semelee's wannabe boyfriend.<br />The next day Jack runs into a gardener named Carl who has a lazy eye and apparently no left arm. He later discovers that Carl used to be a member of the deformed group and gets him to lead Jack to the clan's secret lagoon.<br />After a couple days in Florida, with the ostensible help of Anya, Jack's father comes out of the coma and that's when things get really interesting.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a fun read. A fast moving story of about 370 pages, it may be the most interesting of the Repairman Jack novels since he debuted with the Tomb. The writing is fluid and compelling and we finally get to meet Tom, Repairman Jack's father who is quite a guy himself. You remember him, he's the guy in previous novels that thought Jack repaired appliances.<br />And don't go away folks. The way the book ends is definitely setting up at least one sequel and when it comes to RepairmanJack, that's good news!<br />Final rating 4.6 starses to Repairman Jack, that's good news! <br />Final rating 4.6 stars	2004-02-25

He has a pleasant easy going writing style and manages to come up with some of the darndest most interesting plots in writers-ville.<br />Plot<br />Longtime dedicated Internist, Will Cecil Burleigh, MD. has just sold his lifelong practice. It seems that Will has just learned that he has a, nearly always, fatal form of Cancer, one whose prescribed treatment is so radical and so horrifyingly disfiguring that he has elected to forgo conventional treatment.<br />The Story<br />Our story opens with our protagonist in his car sitting in front of a storefront in a local retail strip center. The storefront is unmarked, except for the word HEALER in rather small writing.<br />Will is trying to talk himself out of going in, being the questioning cynical kind of person he is but he has promised an old patient, Savanna Walters, who was herself diagnosed with a troubling case of Big C but now seemed to be cured, that he would see this, what? Alternative Doctor? New Age Practitioner? Shamen? Con Artist? Healer? After all Savanna claimed she saved her life.<br />Upon entering, the good doctor meets Maya Quennell and is smitten with her beauty. She is ostensibly in her late thirties with dark hair and skin and jade colored eyes. The offspring of a Mayan maiden and a French journalist born in Algeria and raised in France and America.<br />After examining Will on two separate occasions, Maya informs him that she cannot cure him that only Mother Earth can and that his only chance of survival is to stop being a skeptic (it interferes with her kind of healing) and unload all his earthly possessions, give half to charity, put half in a trust for his daughter and go with her to Mexico for treatment.<br />Well, this is too much for a logical person to accept so Will says sorry, to which Maya says you must, &quot;Gaea&quot; (Mother Earth) wills it and and she smiles on you and will give you a sign.<br />After an abbreviated trip to wine country in France, Will receives what he takes as a sign.<br />Back in the USA, Though still skeptical, Will agrees to go with Maya but being the practical person he is, hires a private investigator to check Maya out. What he finds out manages to confuse rather than clarify and the investigator says he will keep investigating after Will leaves and update him via email.<br />So off Will and Maya go, to what Maya calls Mesoamerica an area between the Yucatan Peninsula and the Pacific Ocean, the original home of the Mayan people on a jungle adventure and a date with &quot;Gaea&quot; during the full Moon, to try and save Will's life.<br />Conclusion<br />First of all the book is a little short, being only 213 pages long. That itself isn't so bad but the story suffered for it by not getting developed as good as I know Wilson is capable of doing. It almost seems like he was in a hurry to finish.<br />Personally, and I'm not going to let this influence my rating, I thought the story was a little hoaky, though it flowed well and was an entertaining and fast read. Ultimately it smacked of science fiction. Now I have no problem with science fiction, I just like it to be more definitive and not be merged with an adventure/medical thriller.<br />If I've led you to believe I didn't like the book that much, I'm sorry. I did like the book. It is a quick, fun, easy read but it's not up to Wilson's usual standards. Don't be surprised to see a sequel or two following.After an abbreviated trip to wine country in France, Will receives what he takes as a sign. <br />Back in the USA, Though still skeptical, Will agrees to go with Maya but being the practical person he is, hires a private investigator to check Maya out.

Not personally scary but scary for the world as we know it. Nightworld completes the Nightworld series, which consists of six books, starting with The Keep. I've read all books and until the publication of Nightworld, it was called The Adversary Series, taken from the fact that the underlying element of this series is the ongoing confrontation through eternity and through the universe of two powerful forces.<br />These forces are not defined by good and evil for they are not. But one force, which is called the Other in the books, is brutal and caring nothing for humanity, tends to use evil means to achieve it's goal, while his adversary though not necessarily Good utilizes humanity to thwart His Adversary, The Other.<br />The Anti-Other, throughout history, has utilized a human champion to battle the Other. This champion is empowered with Godlike powers and made immortal for this purpose.<br />In the initial book, The Keep, which I've mentioned, the earthly agent of The Other, Rasalom, was weakened and imprisoned in a specially constructed prison by a champion of a long gone age, maybe a champion named Glaeken, whose subsequent job in The Keep was to keep tabs on The Other and make sure it didn't escape.<br />The Keep is a marvelous story wherein, Rasalom, because of some Nazi soldiers, almost escapes his incarceration. I won't go into the story but at the end, Rasalom is vanquished and ostensibly terminated but this is not to be and through the course of two more books, Reborn and Reprisal, Rasalom is rejuvenated, recuperated re-empowered and is set to take revenge upon troublesome humanity. The stage is set for Nightworld.<br />Nightworld<br />\\"If thou gaze into the abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee\\"<br />What in the world is going on! Sunrise was five plus minutes late! we're in early summer, surise should be later not earlier, and then another shocker, sunset was ten minutes early! This continues on the second day etc and then a bottomless hole 200 feet across and perfectly round opens up in New York's, Central Park.<br />The world's scientific community, though at a loss for these occurrences, downplay these episodes and insist there is a rational explanation for these phenomenons. However, there is one who knows what's going on and he has a birds eye view of the Central Park event from his apartment.<br />It is the ancient warrior Glaeken, who is now in his 80s (his immortality ended after his 1941 battle with Rasalom), living under a pseudonym, Mr. Veileur. Glaeken knows exactly what's going on and he immediately sets out to gather a group of individuals to try to effect some sort of resistance, admittedly an enormous longshot but the only shot humanity has.<br />Main Charactersin order of appearance<br />Rasalom [Evil agent of the Other]<br />Dr. Nicholas Guinn [Physicist and friend of Bill Ryan]<br />Glaeken/veileur [Aged champion of the Anti-Other]<br />(ex father) Bill Ryan [Friend and confidant of Glaeken]<br />Carol Teece [mother of the reborn Rasalom]<br />Repairman Jack [hero of \\"The Tomb\\", a resourceful replacement for the aged Glaeken]<br />Kolabati [an ancient Indian Priestess who has two artifacts Glaeken needs]<br />Ba Nyguen [a special forces trained Vietnamese body guard for the following]<br />Sylvia Nash [mother of the adopted boy Jeffery]<br />Dr Alan Bulmer [Sylvia's husabnd and Jeffery's father]<br />Jeffery [a boy who has a healing power called Dat-tay-vao which Glaekin needs in his battle]<br />Glaeken meets with his would be recruits and of course his story is met with some skepticism, however, as Glaeken predicts, on the second night, hoards of large flying killer insect like creatures(later named by Glaeken as Belly Flies and Chew Wasps descend on an unsuspecting population and kill hundreds of people, horses, dogs etc. Also thousands of these creatures make a beeline to the home of Jeffery and his parents, in an obvious effort to kill Jeffery.<br />These creatures and the even more deadly creatures that follow can't stand sunlight but of course, day by day, the sunlight is slowly disappearing.

I hope you enjoy this review of 'The Tomb', one of my all time favorite horror books.<br />This is the first book involving, the very popular fictional character, Repairman Jack, a character that has become one of the most beloved literary creations since James Bond.<br />Repairman Jack is an unobtrusive looking guy who has slipped in under the government radar. He doesn't exist as far as the government knows. He has no social security number, no credit cards, pays no taxes, pays cash for everything always keeps a low profile.<br />Jack &quot;The Equalizer&quot;. If you remember the TV show of that name from several years ago, that is what Jack does. No he's not &quot;The Equalizer&quot; but if you've been wronged and you've got the money, Jacks available and Jack can be deadly. He can be your worst nightmare but as nightmares go everything is relative and Jack takes second fiddle in this book!<br />Jack has a girlfriend named Gia (they are currently estranged) who has a daughter named Vickey. Jack loves Gia deeply and adores Vickey and would lay down his life for either and in this story he almost does. Now Vickey's father's surname is Wesphalen. None believe it but the Wesphalen family is living under a curse, precipitated by the murderous acts committed by a greedy ancestor over a hundred years ago in India.<br />Kusum Bhakti, an East Indian priest of a tiny sect that worships the bloodthirsty deity Kali and his sister Kolobati are descendants of the victims of the atrocities perpetrated by this elder Wesphalen. They have come to New York City to carry out their vendetta and wipe out the rest of the Westphalen line. Kusum has brought with him the Rakoshi, vicious, flesh eating monsters, to accomplish this horrible undertaking.<br />Rakoshi are huge (over eight feet tall) hideous, malodorous, perversions of the humanity created eons ago by the Otherness. The &quot;Otherness&quot; or &quot;The Other&quot; as it is named in other books is discussed at length in my recently completed review on &quot;Nightworld&quot;<br />Coincidently, Kusum hires Jack to locate the thief that mugged his aged grandmother and stole a necklace which is a family heirloom. Jacks thinks lightning just might strike twice so he dresses up like an old lady and sure enough our perp. attacks him. Jack quickly turns the tables and after a couple broken bones convinces the perp. to relinquish his ill gotten gains. Funny thing, the perp. claims the victim was young.<br />In fact, the aged grandmother is Kolobati, Kusum's younger sister and both of them are almost 150 years old. They maintain their young appearance because of the necklaces they wear (the family heirlooms) and of course when the mugger took the necklace, Kolobati began to age immediately.<br />When Jack returns with the necklace, Kusum is ecstatic and Jack walks away a few thousand richer and now has to visit Gia and Vickey. Gia called while Jack was on the Mugger case and needed to see him.<br />Gia Westphalen had broken off her relationship with Jack but called when one of Vickey's two aunts disappeared. She's decided Jacks line of work, which she abhors and is the reason she broke with Jack, might be helpful to locate the Aunt. Unfortunately the aunt is long gone and the other aunt is next and Jack and Gia get dragged into a battle with Kusum and supernatural creatures, the Rakoshi to save the last remaining Wesphalen - Vickey<br />Conclusion<br />Not for the faint of heart this story gets quite scary as our hero Jack must confront a nest of monsters but an excellent fast paced read that I personally have read four times. For horror fans this is essential reading!!!!<br />This novel has ultimately been listed as one of six books that form the Adversary Cycle. I don't think it started out that way but it ended up that way. It and &quot;The Touch&quot; are self contained reads that can be taken that way with no further reading, however they must be read sometime before reading the final bookof the series &quot;Nightworld&quot;.he final book of the series &quot;Nightworld&quot;.	2003-10-31

His writing style is easy to follow and you always find yourself very involved with, and pulling for the lead character or characters. His writing style and subject matter are not unlike the the medical thriller master, Robin Cook. Palmer is pretty much in the same league, maybe just one tier, below Cook but his best books are probably as good as Cooks.<br />Like most practitioners of Medical mysteries, Palmer is a M.D., a emergency room physician to be exact.<br />Location<br />Fatal primarily takes place in a small country coal mining town in West Virginia named Belinda.<br />Main Characters<br />There are three main characters and the story bounces back and forth between the three until they all come together toward the ending. They are:<br />Dr. Matthew Rutledge - GP and emergency room doctor<br />Ellen Kroft - consumer member of a Presidential task force.<br />Dr. Nikki Solari - Pathologist for city of Boston<br />Other secondary characters but of primary importance to the story are:<br />The Slocumb brothers - back woods moonshiners and hermits.<br />Rudy Peterson - a friend of Krofts<br />Dr. Hal Sawyer - Dr. Rutledges uncle and godfather.<br />Sheriff Grimes - Belinda's law officer<br />The Plot<br />Some people are getting sick even deformed and dying in Belinda and our protagonist, Dr. Matt Rutledge knows it's the fault of the Belinda Coal and Coke Company, commonly known as B.C.& C. the main employer in Belinda.<br />Meanwhile you don't see the connection but in Boston, Nikki Solari's roommate has been acting paranoid and she finally disappears, while in Washington Ellen Kroft is fighting a losing battle on the Omnivax multiple disease / single inoculation program the the first lady is pushing.<br />The Story<br />Rutlege's father had died in a mining accident when he was young and then his young wife had succumbed to a rare form of cancer and now two miners have died by another unusual disease, one which deforms the victim and eats at his brain.<br />Rutledge knows that something is going on at the mine that is making people sick and he wants to prove it.<br />In the meantime, in Boston, Dr. Nikki Solari's Blue Grass musician roommate, Kathy Wilson, has disappeared and seems to have flipped out as she periodically calls Nikki and leaves weird terrified messages.<br />In Washington, Ellen Kroft is fighting a losing battle as the lone consumer advocate on a rigged committee to evaluate a new proposed inoculation system that would include serums for thirty diseases in a single inoculation.<br />Except for Ellen the committee is stocked with M.D.s and P.H.D.s hand picked by the First Ladies staff to be acquiescent toward her pet project called Omnivax.<br />Finally, Kathy Wilson is killed by a truck as she runs out of a bar screaming that they're after her.<br />Nikki now notices that Kathy's face is deformed (same as the miners in Belinda) and asks her boss and mentor to check her brain for anything unusual.<br />Matt finds out there is a toxic dump in a cave near the mine and has Lewis Slocumb guide him. unfortunately they get discovered and lewis gets wounded.<br />Something sounds fishy to Ellen, especially the serum for the deadly African Hemorrhagic disease 'Lassa Fever' and her number crunching friend Rudy discovers some odd irregularities.<br />Nikki heads to Kathy's home town, Belinda, for Kathy's funeral, where events lead our three main characters together for an exciting and thrilling finale with more than a few surprises.<br />SUMMATION<br />This is the sixth book I've read by Michael Palmer and I've always finished his books. This is really a compliment because my home has dozens of partially read books that, while not necessarily bad, just never really caught my interest.<br />Of the six books of his that I read, this falls in the upper third. Fatal moves along nicely, is an easy read and some of the plot twists that seemed a little hokey, make sense as you read on. Like many good writers and magicians Palmer uses misdirection and the plot twist in this book was a surprise to me. What was not a surprise to me and is probably the reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is that I felt the main bad guy was too obvious. If I say any more I might give something away to you potential readers.<br />Fatal is a good, worth while read, that I can heartily recommend and I give a high Four star rating.<br />If you haven't yet read Michael Palmer I recommend him highly as well. Remember I have finished all of his books and thats something I can't say about Stephen Kinglot twists that seemed a little hokey, make sense as you read on.

This book will absorb you and you will eventually end up reading all seven Death Gate Cycle series volumes.<br />And definitely do not read this book if you are satisfied with the fantasy novels you have been reading. What you're currently reading may not measure up.<br />The Authors<br />The Death Gate Series was written by renown Fantasy and Science Fiction authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. This is the first installment of the most impressive fantasy series I have ever read. In fact the seven volume Death Gate Cycle has set a standard so high, it has spoiled fantasy for me. Hence my title. They created such a unique and creative concept and their writing was so clear and easy to follow (Readers of Tolkien take note)that after ten chapters I was hooked.<br />Death Gate Cycle<br />The Setting<br />The Death Gate Cycle is a seven book series about four mythical Realms, actually five, that were created untold ages ago when a powerful magical race, known as the Sartans, sundered the single world into four realms named after the four elements, Sky, Stone, Fire and Water and a fifth realm, the Nexus, which is a Penal colony for the Sartans vanquished rivals, the almost equally powerful Patryns.<br />The Main Characters in order of appearance.<br />Haplo - A Paytryn, explorer/spy<br />Hugh the Hand - A Human, mercenary/hired sword<br />Bane - A Human prince<br />Limbeck - A revolutionary Geg<br />Jarre - His revolutionary wife<br />Alfred - Bane's man servant<br />Haplo's Dog<br />Background<br />Good vs Evil<br />The story revolves around the Sartan and the Patryns. Both races are powerful magicians, the Satan a beneficent people who respect all beings and the nefarious Patryns who want to conquer and subjugate all the races of the world. Eons ago these great and powerful races fought and the Sartan were victorious. Based on some lost plan the Sartan sundered the world creating five realms revolving around the Death Gate. On one of these realms, Nexus, was created a penal colony called the Labyrinth to which the Patryns were exiled. The Labyrinth, which apparently has a life of its own, is a cruel hostile place in which most of the patryns have been exterminated. But finally one great wizard, The Lord of Nexus, escapes into the city(prebuilt by the Sartan) Nexus and starts to help others. And so our story begins;<br />The Plot<br />The Patryns are gradually escaping their tortuous prison, The Labyrinth and are now plotting their revenge against their implacable enemies, the all powerful Sartan. Haplo, the great Lords trusted emissary, is being sent out to cause destabilization in the realms, surreptitiously search for the Sartan and to report back all findings to the Lord.<br />But Haplo is unable to find any Sartan. Where have they gone?<br />Volume I, Dragon Wing<br />Arianus, Mid Realm<br />Hugh the Hand was framed but it doesn't matter. He's about to be beheaded by Three-Chop Nick, an executioner renown for his bungling beheading, when an envoy from King Steven arrives, by Dragon, to save his life.<br />It seems King Steven has a job for Hugh, a reputed assassin.<br />Who is the target of this assignment? Why, it's King Steven's own son, Bane. Meanwhile:<br />Arianus, Low Realm<br />Limbeck the Geg is also in a predicament. What got him in hot water was that he repeated what he saw.<br />The Gegs are a race of small people, similar to the Hobbits from another more obscure novel. They are the sole inhabitants of the lower realm of Arianus and their only purpose in life seems to be to mine coralite by use of an enormous, extraordinary machine, the Gegs call Kicksey Winsey, thats just always been there. The real purpose of the machine is unknown but it manages to allow the Gegs to mine coralite and to sell it to the Godlike Elves from the upper realms.<br />Lembeck, who sees injustice in toiling away for the Elves, saw one of the Elves get killed in an accident taking delivery of a shipment of coralite and informed everyone that the Elves are not Gods, they die just like Gegs, therefore they no longer need to take orders from the Elves. This of course is heresy and leads his banishment to the Steps (the very small islands just below Drevlin, the main island, that are mined for coralite. This is tantamount to a sentence of death as no one ever returns. Meanwhile;<br />Arianus, Mid Realm<br />Back with Hugh, who is ambivilent about his new contract, especially after meeting the seeminly endearing youngster 912 year old), takes Prince Bane on a dragon to another location from which they can hike a couple days to Hugh's Elfen dragon ship, \\"Dragon Wing\\", however Hugh notices that someone is following. So Hugh waylays his follower and captures Alfred, Price Bane's loyal but timid, clumsy and bumbling chamberlain. But is Alfred what he seems? Hugh begins to wonder when an accident occurs involving a deadly Crystal Tree in which neither Prince Bane or Alfred get even so much as a cut and later when they are airborne on the Dragon Wing, Bane poisons Hugh (he knows Hugh's Mission)with a deadly poison only to be awakened(from death?) by Alfred, primarily,so he can stabilize the falling ship. Meanwhile;<br />Arianus, Lower Realm, The Steps<br />Lembeck is Marooned on one of the small unnamed step islands but manages to get his Initials on one of the dig claws to let Jarre, his loyal, loving wife, know where he is. In the meantime the whole island is shaken by something and Lembeck goes to investigate and finds some unknown type of airship has crashed and the occupants, some kind of manlike person, who is severely injured, and a dog, are in imminent danger of getting crushed by a dig claw. Once Lembeck effects their rescue he examines the manlike person(Haplo)and discovers he has tattoos(actually runes) over his entire body and decides, despite the fact the he is near death, that Haplo is a true God. Luckily Jarre is able to send a \\"help hand\\" down to Lembeck to rescue him and he brings back Haplo and the dog with him. Meanwhile;<br />Arianus, Deepsky Descending<br />Bane's poisoning of Hugh has caused a crisis.

It was Sinistrad who instructed Bane to poison Hugh and now the ship is hurtling toward the perpetual storm known as the Malestrom.<br />The Rest of the Story<br />Eventually our main characters will all meet up at Drevlin in the Lower Realm and procede to the Upper Realms, where the action and intrigue continue unabated to the climax, which isn't really the climax since there are six subsequent novels, each one, I think is more exciting than the previous.<br />Authors Note<br />As you can tell, this is a purposely involved and complex story.

US	38622886	R2ANBXMVRG69DI	1586214888	239093791	Lost Light	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Bosch's Back!!!	If you like great mystery writers but haven't read Michael Connelly, you're missing a great one. Michael Connelly after thirteen stellar books is starting to get the recognition that, I knew, he deserved, after reading his award winning fifth book The Poet. Connelly is a superb story teller with some of the best plots I have read. This is not his best read (The Poet, Angels Flight and Blood Work claim that honor) but it's still a very worth while book. In fact Connelly's average books are as good as many other writers better books.<br />Michael Connelly's main character in this and eight of the twelve other books is Hieronymous 'Harry' Bosch, (named after the famous painter)a LAPD homicide detective of impeccable integrity and almost a psychic innate ability for crime solving. Although Bosch had an exemplary arrest and conviction record, he was on the outs with his superiors, more often than not. Bosch was viewed as a cowboy, not a team player, so he never rose in the ranks. In his last Bosch bookCity of Bones, Michael Connelly retired Bosch and many fans thought that was it for their beloved 'Harry'.<br />But never fear, Harry has resurfaced and just as wily and ornery as ever but now he's working outside the law. Such Boschless titles as Chasing the Dime have their merits, but most fans will undoubtedly be elated that Harry is back for another round.<br />Lost Light<br />Our man, Harry Bosch, after a call from Danny Cross decides to look into the four year old murder of a young movie set factotum named Angella Benton. Harry was the original investigator on the case but was subsequently removed after two million dollar heist took place at the movie set, wherein another person was killed and a third injured.<br />At that point both investigations were assigned to robbery detectives, Danny Cross and Lawton Dorsey<br />In the present time when Danny Cross called Harry he is a quadriplegic and the sole survivor of a shootout that happened weeks after the robbery in a bar. Danny Cross's partner was killed and he was left paralyzed and that pretty much stopped the investigation.<br />Harry never forgot Angella Benton and so he began to dig into the case. He started by interviewing the film's producer<br />The next morning, an old partner of Harry's, Kiz Rider, who had been promoted to some elevated rank, showed up at his house and told him to stay away from the case. Now if you want Harry to stay away from a case, you don't tell him to stay away, so Harry asked why, who would care, it was a cold case not being worked. Kiz told him it was being worked at the highest levels and he could get in some serious trouble.<br />Trouble never stopped Harry so he next visited the Quadriplegic, Danny Cross, to ask what else he remembers. The only additional information he can give Harry is that some FBI agent, a woman, called a couple weeks after the heist and told his partner, the late Lawson Dorsey that one of the serial numbers they were given didn't add up.<br />Harry jumped on this lead and discovered that The FBI agent was a Martha Gessler and that she disappeared shortly after her phone call. He also discovered that he was being tailed by an FBI goon.<br />Harry keeps getting in deeper and deeper into the case and eventually gets rousted by a crack anti-terrorism unit of the FBI. Who has in custody numerous terror suspects including one who was arrested at the Mexican border with a hundred dollar bill with a serial number matching one on the stolen money list, the so-called reason to lay off the case.<br />All the terrorism suspects are being held without counsel etc., so Harry thinks he may never get out and might just disappear but they finally let him out with a very stern warning. In the meantime Harry shows up the goon and makes an enemy.<br />Harry gets a little help from a regular FBI agent, who had worked with him in the past and happens to have been Martha Gesslers boyfriend. Meanwhile the plot keeps getting more and more convoluted.<br />When Harry finally figures out who the killers are Harry does a dumb thing and confronts them. They subsequently visit him at his home which leads to some very tense minutes and Harry is almost killed again but finally he prevails.<br />End of story right? Wrong! In typical unpredictable Connelly style, he still has a several important twists left, which you'll find out when you read the book.<br />This book was a real page turner, not unusual for Connelly. The story, though not his best, was still well done and most definitely held my interest. The central character, Harry Bosch works alone, in this book, therefore the supporting cast is limited.<br />Michael Connelly, Magician<br />Like a great magician, Michael Connelly Has the ability to misdirect and mislead his audience(the reader), with his twisting scenarios. In his previous book Chasing the Dime I not only was surprised by the ending, I was very impressed at how well Connelly was able to deflect any suspicion of the ending. This book is similar so be prepared to be surprised.<br />Connelly, having been a journalist, has a nice flowing easy to read style. I seem to be able to read his books faster because his writing is unpretentious and straightforward so I get everything at first glancemore convoluted. <br />When Harry finally figures out who the killers are Harry does a dumb thing and confronts them.

In his previous book Chasing the Dime I not only was surprised by the ending, I was very impressed at how well Connelly was able to deflect any suspicion of the ending. This book is similar so be prepared to be surprised. <br />Connelly, having been a journalist, has a nice flowing easy to read style. I seem to be able to read his books faster because his writing is unpretentious and straightforward so I get everything at first glance	2003-07-01

In The Jester, James Patterson is taking a totally new direction from his best selling previous novels, which were mostly intriguing suspense novels. My favorite novel by James Patterson is Kiss the Girls a gripping page turner about a pair of psychopathic serial murderers, one on the east coast and one on the west coast who were friends and compared notes. Kiss the Girls was also made into a movie and with the benefit of having my favorite actor(Morgan Freeman) and my favorite actress(Ashley Judd), playing leading roles, was my favorite movie of that year.<br />Well in real life there's only so many serial killers around(one or two a year I guess) and since the market had been saturated by Patterson along with Thomas Harris, John Sanford and numerous other serial killer writers, it was time to look in a new direction. Patterson and Gross not only changed they're direction they went back in time to the late eleventh century and the age of the 1st Crusade.<br />I am, somewhat, a student of history and having read a couple books on the vague but terribly interesting history of the Crusades, I believe the setting for this story seems well researched and very accurate.<br />Now, in addition to being accurate about the setting I'm afraid it is also accurate about brutality and inhumanity of the age as well. If your looking for Damsels in distress and Knights in shinning armor willing to give their life for their beneficent liege lord, go buy King Arthur instead. In this book you're more likely to be killed at the hands of your maleficent liege lord.<br />In fact, as Kiss the Girls had two predators. The Jester also has two main bad guys(two Dukes) and a cast of hundreds of other cruel murderous supporters. These local bad boys used to randomly rape, murder and burn villages in the name of the Duke. And of course that makes you feel good as our hero manages to infiltrate and turn the tables on these evil characters.<br />But it's not that easy, and our hero goes through hell on earth, first venturing off to the Crusades for two years, where he barely escapes death numerous times, while seeing friends get massacred. Then going home only to find out his Inn (Hugh was an Innkeeper)had been burned down and his infant son, which he didn't know he had, had been thrown in the flames and his wife Sophie taken away by the marauders, to who knows where. The consensus among the villagers was that she was dead, however Hugh felt she wasn't and so he starts out on an odyssey of rescue and revenge.<br />Along the way, Hugh manages to get gored by a boar, saved from slow death by the beautiful noble lady in waiting, Emilee, subsequently tutored in the ways of Jestering by her friend, Norbert, so he could infiltrate his perceived enemies court and thats where I need to stop and you need to read the book.<br />I will say this though. There is something Hugh has that he picked up in the Crusades that others want. That is behind all his troubles when he returns. You could ultimately draw parallels between this story and Spartacus but the ending is happier.<br />How does this book compare with Patterson's other books?, Well, I think kiss the Girls was better and Along Came a Spider but I liked it better than the other five or six I read, one or two of which were downright silly. One problem I had with the book was, that while certain events were suspenseful the ultimate end was transparent to me. Because of that this book is slightly below *****, rounded back up.ugh hell on earth, first venturing off to the Crusades for two years, where he barely escapes death numerous times, while seeing friends get massacred.

Question: What is six Lawyers bound and gagged at the bottom of a lake?<br />Answer: A good start.<br />I'm not a proponent of hanging all lawyers from the nearest tree, there are some decent hard working ones, but I personally would like to see a few in hell.<br />When it comes to the law, I can't seem to get over the hump. I'm like the guy walking around with his personal rain cloud 12 inches above his head.<br />It doesn't matter which side of an issue I'm on, or how strong my case is, I seem to be on the wrong side. No matter how bullet proof my case seems to be the law twists it around and makes it weak. And of course my attorney, whom I thought to be a brilliant, eloquent tactician turns out to be Elmer Fudd in disguise. Beware of people that get injured while setting a fire to your house, they will get a lawyer or two and sue.<br />Now John Grisham on the otherhand, is a winner when it comes to the law. He writes about about unsavory unethical members of the legal profession and makes millions doing it. Good for him. He's strayed a couple times but his best work is legal thrillers, and don't you get the feeling that it's a labor of love. That he despises the profession as much as we do and gets his jollies exposing unscrupulous characters. Oh sure it's fiction but can you doubt the truth is far away.<br />The King of Torts like many of Grisham's novels is a story with a moral, no make that two morals. Moral one is that easy money leads to greed which leads to unscrupulous behavior, which then leads to a win at all costs mentality. Moral two I'm saving for later. Our protagonist, J Clay Carter, scoffed at the silliness of the wanton spending and bravado of the mass tort lawyers at a mass tort convention one week and two weeks later was coveting their possessions and several months later buying one expensive toy after another.<br />This novel starts out slowly with our quasi-hero J Clay Carter, who is a Washington DC public defender, getting corraled into taking murder case of a young black male, Tequila Watson who inexplicably shot another y.b.m for no apparent reason.<br />J. Clay Carter has been a P.D. for five years and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. This annoys the lovely Rebbecca, Clay's girlfriend of four years and her gruesome parents to no end.<br />At one time Clay's star shone very bright as his father was a prominent DC litigator and the plan was for Clay to join him. That plan fell through when the father was about to be indicted for some offense and made a deal with an assistant Attorney General to give up the practice and leave the country. This obviously narrowed Clay's options so he become a low paid P.D.<br />Back to Tequila Watson. As Clay looked into Tequila's case, it didn't make much sense because Tequila only had a passing acquaintance with the victim, didn't have a history of violence and he himself didn't know why he shot the victim.<br />Tequila was on a two hour pass from an inner city drug rehab lockdown joint when the incident happened so he went their for the records and gets stonewalled. In the meantime Clay's romance hits the rocks and they break up.<br />The next day at 5:30 in the morning Clay gets a call from a Max Pace, with an offer of a lucrative job but when he gets there Max has a different agenda. It seems he is a fireman, as in damage control, for a large drug conglomeration. It seems that this drug company was surreptitiously testing a new drug called Tarvan, which killed any addiction. Unfortunately it made killers out of five percent of the addicts.<br />Max Pace proposed that Clay quit the Public Defenders office, take a couple of their more talented employees with him and open up his own office whereupon he was to enlist the families of these senseless random murders as clients and pay them each five million dollars for their releases.<br />Clay was to receive the gross figure of fifteen million.<br />When this is complete, the mysterious Max sets Clay up for another windfall, a mammoth class action suit against another drug company. Clay jumps in and is soon joined by every major ambulance chaser in the country in a mega suit. Don't you just love it, the egomaniac sleazy lawyers in a battle to the death against the equally distasteful legal drug monopolies.<br />As time progresses Clay's company needs to grows to accommodate the massive lawsuit, which means that they need more suits to cover the spiraling expenses. Of course Clay's accountant is worried but Clay constantly reminds him that \\"if you want to make it, you got to spend it\\".<br />If you don't want to know the ending, stop right here<br />Well Clay goes on to be recognized as a rising superstar lawyer while Rebecca gets married and Clay brings a gorgeous model, Ridley, to the wedding reception and then takes up with her. but things are just not right. Clay misses Rebecca terribly and the lawfirm has grown to fast and pretty soon the house of cards is falling apart.<br />At Max's urging Clay takes on giant manufacturer Goffman(sounds like Johnson and Johnson), which turns out to be Clay's first big mistake. They're a tough nut to crack and the beginning of the end for Clay's law firm<br />In the end Clay gets his girl back and like the protagonists in his other novels, gives up law and rides off into the sunset, which is kind of what the author John Grisham has done.<br />Oh, and moral number two is, \\"Money isn't everything\\", although the author is fabulously rich.ther windfall, a mammoth class action suit against another drug company.

The time is Spring 1941, in the middle of World War II.<br /><br />A weary, ragtag column of German soldiers work their way up the pass road to a odd twelfth century castle, known as the Keep. Through a sleepy village and the morning fog, Captain Woermann gets his first glimpse of the bizarre structure. As he crosses the bridge over the moat, he puzzles how the castle has been built backwards compared to normal castles, with the large stones on the inside, instead of the outside. Almost like it was built to keep something inside, rather than outside. The strangeness of the Keep continues inside, where hundreds of peculiar nickel crosses have been mortised into the stone walls at regular intervals.<br /><br />Captain Woermann, has orders to occupy and hold the structure. As he and his men are settling in, a couple of his soldiers bring an elderly and a younger man. They are father and son caretakers. Their progenitors have been maintaining the Keep for hundreds of years. Who pays them, they know not. Their family merely receives periodic stipends in payment for their work.<br /><br />The caretakers are surprised when Woermann tells them, he is claiming the Keep in the name of Third Reich and they will be occupying the premises, the caretaker tells them no one stays overnight in the Keep. Those that sleep there, never stay more than once. All have had nightmares and some have gone mad.<br /><br />Woermann feels there is evil within the Keep but he has orders. The next morning one of the soldiers is found dead and another is missing. The dead soldier's head had been ripped off. Woermann continues to loose troops nightly and requests help. Careless soldiers in search of treasure have freed a supernatural monster and provided sustenance for it's weakened state as well.<br /><br />The help that finally arrives in the form of a SS Sturmbannfuhrer Kaempffer and his men, only makes matters worse. Confident that the killings are the result of partisan fighters, Kaempffer has ten villagers executed, but the killings continue, each more gruesome than the last and strange things start to be noticed about the corpses as well.<br /><br />The story gets a little complex hereon. Eventually a sickly Jewish Scholar of ancient languages and his daughter are brought in to decipher messages, that have been left in ancient Cyrillic script. An ageless warrior named Glaeken leaves Portugal for Dinu Pass, once again called to duty after receiving a vision of the imminent freedom, of his ancient maleficent adversary. circumstances creep inexorably toward a reprise of the titanic battle fought eight centuries ago between good and evil.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Seldom do I read a book more than once. The Keep is one of the exceptions. The Keep was written almost twenty-five years ago by a New England doctor by the name of F. Paul Wilson. This was the first book I read by him but not the last. I have been so impressed with his brilliant stories, fluid, easy going writing style and the sheer novelty of his plots, that I never fail to pick up his latest book.<br /><br />After the Keep, I picked up and read The Tomb a book that is every bit the classic, The Keep is. The Tomb featured, for the first time, the irrepressible Repairman Jack, one of contemporary literature's most popular an beloved characters.<br /><br />In The Keep, the primary characters kept changing or maybe I should say the author kept adding characters so, you didn't get a good feel for any one character. We start out with Captain Boermann and Kaempffer is added. They obviously have a past and in addition to the normal tension between regular army and SS troops, didn't like each other. Rosalom (the Vampire like evil entity) was hard to pinpoint. At one poin the was killing Nazis and I found myself hoping he was a good creature but in reality he was worse than even the Nazis. The ailing professor was good and pure and Rasalom needed him, so he temporarily cured the professor's ailments. He had even the Jewish Professor fooled into helping him by convincing him he would help the Jews by killing Hitler. Then of course we ultimately have our hero Glaeken, who has battled Rasalom before and has traveled across Europe to confront him again. None of these characters are in the forefront long enough to get a feel for, but if this is a weakness in the story I didn't notice.<br /><br />The story comes at you, fast and furious. It is thrilling and terrifying all in one. The creature is the personification of evil and gains strength each day. I don't think it started out that way but The Keep, became the first book in a series, known as the Adversary Series. The Keep is one of my favorite books. 5 stars.ood and pure and Rasalom needed him, so he temporarily cured the professor's ailments.
