A small book is also included.<br />I was really surprised.  Although only made of thin card, it is actually proving to be more durable than I thought ... my girls (4 and almost 3) are so careful with it as they make the characters and animals \\"walk\\" around, visiting each other, doing farm chores.  And they spend half an hour or more at a time completely engrossed this thier role play.<br />It helps that Maisy is one of their favourite characters in books and videos and this gives them a chance to tell the Maisy adventure they want to dream up!<br />Great way to get them to tell you a story.<BR>Highly recommended.	2004-01-23

They love Barney so the book was an instant hit.<br />They love the fact that they can lift the flaps as I read them the story - makes for a really fun and exciting reading session (no matter how many times I've read it to them).  They also enjoy looking through it themselves and love lifting all the flaps.<br />I can't tell you how many times this book has been read in the last 6 months but it's been ALOT.  The flaps have held up well with the constant use and none look anywhere near ripping - this book is good quality.<br />As they are learning their ABC's and 123's this book has continued to hold their interest.<br />Recommended if you love Barney, love \\"flap books, or just want an interesting and fun way to learn your ABC's and 123's.	2003-02-14

I think this will be the last one I buy - I was so disappointed in the story.  Having said that, I re-read her older novels over and over which always provide me with great enjoyment despite being read before.  Books of Danielle Steel's that I would recommend include 'Remembrance', ' Palomino', 'Changes', 'Thurston House'and 'Wanderlust'.<br />If you are a die-hard fan ... you will probably enjoy this book.  If you are new to Danielle Steel - pick an earlier book for a really enjoyable read.	2002-08-13

All I want is an enjoyable book to read at night before I go to bed to wind down after a busy day - and this book fits the bill perfectly.<br />The characters are wonderful, and interesting and you can't help but get involved in their story from the very start.  It's also a really &quot;meaty&quot; novel.  By this I mean, the story is well developed, goes where you want it to go, you find out how each issue is resolved and you aren't disppointed when the book ends ... their are no loose ends that leave you thinking &quot;where's the rest of the book&quot;?<br />Highly recommended if you are looking for an enjoyable easy to read novel.	2002-08-13

The characters were just ordinary people heading off to a evening class of learning italian and their lives were all touched in a wonderful way by their teacher Signora.<br />A thorougly enjoyable book, easy to read and if you enjoy reading before going to sleep at night - this is a good one.	2002-04-27

I was desperate for something to read and her name is always mentioned so I thought I would give it a try (I'm a big fan of early Danielle Steel and Cathy Kelly).<br />I found this book really difficult to get into ... so many characters and it continually jumped around and I was getting confused as to who was related to who and what their role in the story was.  But I perserved (as I'm the sort of person that always has to read something to get to sleep at night and it's the only book I had at the time) and I finally finished it.  It all sort of came together in the end and I found myself quite involved in the story by the last couple of chapters.<br />I'm going to try another of her books (Evening Class ... I hope I've picked a good one) and see how it goes .. I hope this one is an &quot;easier&quot; read as when I go to bed - I just want an enjoyable book and not have to worry about which character is which and who is related to who.	2002-04-15

This one made me laugh, cry and wish that all would go well for Audrey.<BR>If you are a Danielle Steel fan you will love this one.

The ageing actor who is so broke he has to rent out areas in his home but still spends like there is no tomorrow.  The energetic sexual relationship between 25 plus years old and a 70 year old man (I don't think so - and I think it's pretty gross!).  The neonatal nurse who saves premmie babies everyday but things aborotion is ok.  The ending I guessed about halfway through - it was so obvious.  It just wasn't an entertaining read.<BR>Danielle Steel books used to be so good!  A really good romantic story but now it seems she gets started on a book, gets about halfway through and then rushes to the end.  Very disappointing.  <BR>If you are new to Danielle Steel - I wouldn't recommend this one.  Try one of her earlier great books \\"Thurston House\\", \\"Wanderlust\\" or \\"Palomino\\".	2002-03-29

Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she has written.  <BR>The characters in this story annoyed me a bit - like get it together and decide if you want to be together.  No one can be that indecisive about love - their &quot;off and on and off and on&quot; relationship annoyed me.  An ok Danielle Steel but if I had a choice I'd choose another one like &quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;Thurston House&quot; or &quot;Mixed Blessings&quot; which I enjoyed more than this one.	2002-03-27

Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she This book was ok - the struggle of Marie making it on her own with only the support of her one true childhood friend makes it a great story but why does Danielle Steel keep doing this in her later novels:  The story is going great and then all of a sudden it seems like she got to the required number of pages and finishes it up quickly and suddenly.  It's frustrating when you get so involved in the lives of the characters and then it suddenly ends.  Disappointing.	2002-03-27

This book is very simple for her to understand and she can see the pictures of the girls with their potty on their head or feet - something she has done with hers - and the story tells us that this isn't what pottys are for.  There are lots of different types of pottys in the photographs of this book so you might be able to spot the one you are using at home ... we did and we found that very helpful.  The fact that they use photographs and not illustrations is also helpful so my daughter can actually see a nappy (diaper) and then the girl move on to \\"big girls pants\\".  After reading this book to my daughter every night for the past month I'm finding that it is helping us move closer to a positive result with potty training.

The lift-the-flaps get my children involved in the story while I read it to them.  No matter how many times we read it, it's always a surprise to find out what is under the flap.  A lovely book to share with your growing children and one that isn't too babyish when they start to read themselves.	2002-02-02

My girls love them.  As I read to them they use the little figurine to act out what is happening in the story.  On each page there is a box telling you what the figurine should be doing now as the story unfolds.  Or you can do your own actions.  A fun book to read and a must-have for Little People fans!	2002-02-02

They love the simple stories that they can relate to (hiding, baking a cake, playing with others etc) and the lift-the-flaps always bring screams of delight even though we've read them many many times.  As they grow I'm sure they'll be one of the books they learn to read with.  The words are simple and the font easy to read.  Lovely books to cuddle up with your children on your lap.  They are also big enough to hold up and read to them as they sit in back seat on car trips.	2002-02-02

I actually bought this book when I was first pregnant. Two miscarriages later and pregnant for the 3rd time this book was on hand at all times. I was constantly worried and fearful that I was going to miscarry for a third time. This book helped me ease my fears when I looked up something and found my symptom or worry was perfectly normal.<br />The book covers everything from conception, symptoms of pregnancy, month by month of your pregnancy, labour, birth and then a section for \\"when something goes wrong\\" (only read if something does go wrong - you don't want to cause yourself unneccesary worry), and a section for new dads.  Each month, rather than just a heading for a topic they have people's questions and they were answered with plenty of general information.  I found that finding certain topics was really easy - the book was laid out well.<br />My ob/gyn was of course my first point of contant for any fear or worry - but those times in the middle of the night when I just needed to get to sleep, this book was my warm milk!	2002-01-09
