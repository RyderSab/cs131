I read it in less than two days and just loved it. Feldman, author of the excellent historial fiction novel \\"Lucy,\\" out does herself with \\"The Boy Who Loved Anne Frank.\\" The author begins with the idea: suppose Peter van Pels (van Daan in Anne's diary) had also survived the concentration camps? (And indeed, the real Peter's fate was the last to be discovered for certain after the war ended.) Where would his life have taken him? Feldman takes Anne's impressions of Peter and uses them to build him into a fictional character that captures you from the first page. He is real without being overly sentimental, a perfect blend of how Anne saw him, and how Feldman imagines him.<br /><br />Peter has traveled to America, determined to erase all vestiges of his past (as quoted by Anne in her diary, the real Peter planned to deny he was a Jew after the war) and has done quite well for himself, constructing a tidy life in suburbia (but still using his real name, a \\"good American name\\"). Things are going well until Anne's diary is first published in America in 1952. Then, slowly but inexorably, Peter's carefully contructed facade, not as solid as he'd imagined it was, begins to unravel, as his family and the world at large becomes fascinated with the diary, the play, and the movie. Everything he thought he remembered, and thought he could hide forever, becomes tangled up in the Hollywood portrayals of the people in the Annex and other events surrounding the diary's publication. Finally Peter reaches a point where hiding from who he is, and was, is no longer possible for him.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending, but wind up by saying that anyone who has read Anne's diary, and even those who haven't, will enjoy this wonderful novel. My only (slight) criticism (for lack of a better word) was that I would have liked to see more memories of Peter's life in hiding (especially his feelings about Anne both before and after her death).gs about Anne both before and after her death).	2005-03-24

He sets the tone when, in the introduction to this book, he comes right out and says that previous books on Henry's six wives (by Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser) aren't nearly as good as his. The quote: &quot;Inevitably, the 20th century versions of the Six Wives have stood in Strickland's [a 19th century biographer] shadow. Both...Weir and Fraser...have reverted to Strickland's tried-and-tested formula.&quot; Strickland caused scholars to &quot;see things&quot; and by balancing their books among the Six Wives (instead of doing as Starkey does, devoting the lion's share of his book to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn), the other authors are &quot;distorting the record.&quot;<br /><br /> And that's just the beginning. Through out the book, Starkey will interrupt his own historical narrative with the &quot;I&quot; point of view, citing facts or anecdotes that *he* has found that other historians have &quot;overlooked&quot; or &quot;ignored&quot; or &quot;misinterpreted.&quot; Examples: p. 447, &quot;In fact, though much has been made of St. German by some modern historians, his ideas fell at the first fence.&quot; From p. 435, &quot;Here it is important to be clear about Henry's developing strategy. From the moment of the failure of the Blackfriar's trial, it had been taken for granted that an English verdict on the Divorce would somehow have to be sanctioned by Parliament. There is no mystery about this, as some modern historians like to claim.&quot; These are only two of many, many instances where Starkey pats himself on the back about how brilliant he is, and how everyone else has gotten it so, so wrong. He claims to be the only one to have properly identified Catherine Howard's and one of Catherine Parr's portraits. He also claims to be revealing much information &quot;for the first time ever.&quot; Apparently no one else does their research but him.<br /><br /> Another complaint I had was with the structure of the book; as previously mentioned, Starkey devotes about 75% of the book to the first two wives, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. He goes on for far too long about Henry's divorce from Catherine, to the point where the detail becomes mind-numbing, and it's difficult to keep track of who's doing what. In addition, the sections on Catherine and Anne are kept completely separate, despite the fact that their histories with Henry overlap by a number of years. As a result, Starkey ends up repeating much of his story twice over, once in the &quot;Divorcing Catherine&quot; section (where Anne's name is never mentioned) and once again in the &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; section (from which Catherine is completely absent for about the first half). This makes the flow of the story very choppy.<br /><br /> Henry's last four wives get short changed to a great extent; apparently since none were married to Henry nearly as long as either Catherine of Aragon or Anne Boleyn, they don't count for as much. And the book ends abruptly when Henry dies, finishing up the tale of Catherine Parr in only one paragraph. If Starkey was set on the idea of ending the book right after Henry's death (which, by the way, is related in one off-hand sentence!), I think at least an epilogue detailing Catherine Parr's eventual fate would have been more appropriate; as written, the ending to her story is far too hastily done and neglects important events in her life as well as the advancement of the Protestant faith in England.<br /><br /> On a related note, Starkey's favorite is obviously Anne Boleyn, with the other wives suffering a bit by his comparisons; if you believe Starkey, Catherine of Aragon was a hysteric who lied about consummating her first marriage to Henry's brother Arthur, Jane Seymour was an &quot;accessory after the fact&quot; to Anne Boleyn's murder, and Anne of Cleves spent most of her life after her divorce either scheming to get Henry back, or whining about the raw deal she got. Starkey doeshave some sympathy for Catherine Howard, but it seems misguided at times; he claims she couldn't possibly have actually slept with Thomas Culpepper, they were just platonic friends from way back, an assertion that seems based on nothing more than Starkey's own personal beliefs on the subject.<br /><br /> Having now read all three of the major, modern biographies of Henry's Six Wives, I would recommend Antonia Fraser's book over this one. One review printed on the back of this book says that with &quot;Starkey's wit and style, it doesn't seem a page too long.&quot; Oh, I quite definitely disagree.erine Howard, but it seems misguided at times; he claims she couldn't possibly have actually slept with Thomas Culpepper, they were just platonic friends from way back, an assertion that seems based on nothing more than Starkey's own personal beliefs on the subject.

Once I got over the initial excitement of so much gossip all at once, I took a closer look, and found that in many, many instances, Higham gets the most basic information completely wrong. Information that is laughably easy to verify. For example:<br />1. Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg's daughter is named Katherine, not Barbara. She was born in 1935, not 1936.<br />2. Ted Healy died from injuries suffered in a bar brawl, kidney failure, and alcoholism, not from a heart attack brought on by Mayer. He was 41, not 45, when he died.<br />3. Jean Harlow never had an affair with her stepfather, Marino Bello; in fact, she hated him. And she didn't encourage her friends and colleagues to invest in his &quot;gold mines,&quot; either.<br />4. John Gilbert didn't die of a heart attack. He was given a sedative by his nurse, had an adverse reaction, and choked to death while unattended.<br />And so on...<br />In addition, Higham is very partial to some stars and absolutely hates others; these attitudes come across in Mayer's biography so strongly that they are often distracting from the story itself. Garbo is a monster of selfishness. Crawford is a bed-hopping tramp. Shearer is a terrible snob. Some of which may be true, but I'm sure these people had their good sides, too, but you won't find such balance here.<br />At first glance, there is quite a bit of fascinating, never-before-known &quot;information&quot; in this book. After realizing how little the author checks his facts, though, I have to wonder if any of these incredible tales are true, or even close to true.	2004-05-11

Being a fan of Dunne's writing, I bought it and read it, not knowing any of the backstory. The story brings together various topics I always enjoy in a story: high society, scandalous crimes, and dramatic love stories. It's another juicy, gossipy novel of the kind most readers expect from Dunne.<br />Then I learned that the story was based on a real-life incident, the shooting of Billy Woodward by his wife, Ann, in 1955. Well, I thought, Dunne has a well-documented &quot;in&quot; with society people, so he must have heard the whole true story over the years, and cleverly, but thinly, disguised it as fiction, in the same way that Truman Capote (&quot;Basil Plant&quot;) did. Dunne is also known for his advocacy of crime victims and condemnation of the rich who escape justice, so I assumed that his novel was intended as the punishment Ann Grenville/Woodward never received in life.<br />Alas, next came some disillusionment. So absorbing is this book, I'd allowed myself to forget that it is indeed fiction, and accepted Dunne's version of events as completely true. Further reading (namely &quot;This Crazy Thing Called Love&quot; by Susan Braudy) brought to my attention many facets of this story ignored by the fiction writers: Billy Woodward wasn't nearly as saintly as Billy Grenville; he beat his wife and cheated on her often. There really was a prowler in the Woodward's neighborhood the night of the shooting. I could go on, but I won't. Suffice it to say that there are really two sides to this story.<br />Well, you may say, this is a fictional account of the incident, and as such artistic license allows for any and all fabrications. A more balanced portrait of the two principal characters would not have made nearly as juicy and interesting a story. Both good points; as fiction, the novel is quite enjoyable. Just don't make the same mistake I did, and assume that &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot; tells the whole story of the Woodward shooting.y of the Woodward shooting.	2004-01-28

Beatrice Lacey, the (anti)heroine of &quot;Wideacre,&quot; is a thousand times worse...but she makes delightful reading.<br />It's a shame the editorial review spoiled the important plot points, because I think they're even more deliciously awful when you come upon them by surprise. Every time you think you've finally got a handle on just how low Beatrice will stoop, she turns around and does something else even worse, brimming over with schemes that wouldn't ever occur to &quot;normal&quot; people.<br />I had trouble putting the book down, and raced through the last few chapters, completely captivated and dying to find out what would happen next. A truly satisfying read.<br />On a final note, I agree with previous reviewers who stated that this book shouldn't be filed in the romance category. While it does occasionally stray slightly into &quot;bodice ripper&quot; territory, you're not going to find hearts and flowers in this book.	2003-08-02

J.K. Rowling warned us in interviews that this Harry Potter book would be darker than the rest, and she wasn't kidding. Still, the storytelling grabs you from the first page and keeps you spellbound (pun intended) until the very end of the book.<br />There is a definite sense that the characters, wizard and Muggle alike, are maturing into adults. There's a lot more angst this time around, not only about Voldemort and what he might be up to, but also things that ordinary teenagers worry about. I think it really gives a new depth to characters that readers may have thought they already knew so well.<br />Rowling also mentioned in interviews that one of main characters would be killed off, and while I didn't want to know ahead of time who it was (so I'm not going to tell you here), just knowing that someone would die gave an extra edge to the story. There are a few \\"teaser\\" incidents in the book that make you gasp, \\"Oh, no, don't kill [fill in the blank]!\\" which added even more to the suspense.<br />We also get more of the back story involving Harry's parents, and his connection to Voldemort, which takes a surprising turn and makes the plot much more dark and complicated. People who have dismissed Harry Potter as children's literature will be in for quite a surprise.<br />Bravo to J.K. Rowling for another outstanding Harry Potter story!	2003-06-23

Amazon recommended this book to me based on other purchases, and I'm so glad they did! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I read this book immediately after finishing \\"I, Elizabeth,\\" and thought that going from that point of view into a new one would be jarring, but I fell smoothly into Mary's story and loved every minute of it.<br />The book could easily have romanticized the story of Mary Boleyn and her affair with the king, but instead shows a very realistic picture---there is love there, but there is also deceit, manipulation, and betrayal. Anne Boleyn is not just a {prostitue} who displaced a queen, but a real person who in the end falls prey to her own overpowering ambitions. Even Henry has his gentle side, and isn't portrayed solely as a tyrant who likes shedding wives. There are tender moments, and then there are scenes that will make you shudder and be very glad you're not a woman living during the reign of Henry VIII.<br />I did find the ending to be a little abrupt; Mary is at court with her husband and children, trying in her own way to help Anne. She witnesses Anne's execution (thinking all the while that Henry will pardon her at the last, dramatic moment), leaves with her husband and children to go home, and there the book ends. After getting to know Mary so intimately through out the rest of the book, I would have liked more of a reaction to Anne's death and the aftermath. Since most people are familiar with Anne rather than Mary, though, I suppose it made sense to end the book there. I was so immersed in the story, though, that I could have happily read about Mary's adventures for the rest of her life, even if she never went near royalty again.	2003-05-01

Perhaps I'm too used to a more conventional style of biography, but I found \\"Rosebud\\" hard to get through. As fascinating a person as Orson Welles was, parts of this book were still slow going. The author constantly interrupts the narrative with \\"dialogues\\" between himself and...himself? The publisher? An imaginary reader? It's hard to say, and seems to be used mostly to insert his own presence into the biography, and to do an end run around any potential libel.<br /><br />Other unnecessary bits include a whole chapter of this dialogue between the author and his imaginary friend as they watch the first few minutes of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" and another entire chapter about how the author became a fan of Welles. This is supposed to be a biography of Orson Welles, not a book about how David Thomson feels about Orson Welles, and how Thomson has taught \\"Citizen Kane\\" in his class for years, blah blah blah. Every time Welles' own story gets interesting, Thomson pops up to remind you he's there. Ideally, a reader shouldn't be bombarded with the presence of the author in a biography.<br />There is some interesting information, but the book as a whole is not put together very well.	2003-02-26

The main problem with this book can be summed up by quoting its own dust jacket:<br />&quot;Schoell and Quirk [the authors] move beyond the myths and misconceptions about Crawford by looking extensively at her film work, which in many respects---as Crawford herself admitted---was her life.&quot;<br />And that's it right there: as admirable an actress as Crawford may have been (and I am a fan of many her performances), her roles in films cannot provide much of a basis for a biography about her actual life. The line between fantasy and reality is, in this case, not only blurred, but erased almost completely.<br />I understand that Quirk was a fan and professed confidant of Crawford's (that fact is hard to miss, it's mentioned so many times) and his intentions seem to be to try his best to defend her honor and reveal his version of the truth about her. In doing so, however, Quirk makes several missteps, the most notable among them being his complete and utter of savaging of Christina Crawford because of her allegations of abuse against her mother. He says terrible things; for example, he expresses his opinion that Christina's near fatal stroke in 1981 was &quot;Joan getting revenge beyond the grave.&quot; For someone who thinks Christina was wrong to say bad things about her mother, Quirk in turn says even worse things about Christina. In trying to dispute the charges she made in &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; he protests way, way too much, and stoops even lower than the level he accuses her of sinking to.<br />Even other friends of Crawford's are criticized for not living up to his exacting standards. For example, in 1984 about 125 friends and family of Crawford took out a tribute ad in the &quot;Daily Variety&quot; to show their support in the wake of the &quot;Mommie&quot; book and movie. I thought it was a nice gesture, myself, but Quirk says that it was &quot;put together for the wrong reasons by the wrong people.&quot; What really seems to be wrong is the fact that he wasn't included, and now he's pouting.<br />When I got to the &quot;Notes&quot; section at the end of the book, I thought, &quot;okay, now we'll see where he got all this information.&quot; I was disappointed to discover that the majority of his sources are &quot;Joan Crawford to Lawrence Quirk.&quot; Interviewing the subject of a biography is of course helpful when it's possible to do, but any writer worth his salt knows that it can't be your only, or even your primary, source.

Unfortunately, in the case of \\"Hannibal,\\" the plot leaves a lot to be desired. The whole thing was so bizarre that I had to finish it just to see how it turned out, but did I like what I was reading? Not so much. I'm referring specifically to the ending, which I thought was absolutely ridiculous. I can't accept that the Clarice Starling readers have come to know, admire, and even love, would ever run off with Lecter.<br />As far as the other characters are concerned, the new ones are so far over the top as to be completely unrealistic (Mason and Margot), and most of those we remember from \\"Silence\\" behave in ways that are just too outrageous to be credible. I finished this book and just sat with my mouth open, unable to believe what I had just read. \\"Sex is a splendid structure they add to every day,\\" is not a sentence I ever wanted to read about Starling and Lecter. It's just...wrong. Granted, these are Harris' characters and he can do with them what he likes, but I think he dropped the ball on this one.<br />My last complaint: Harris' clumsy attempts to explain the origin of Hannibal's evil. He should have left well enough alone. To me, it is much scarier *not* to know why Hannibal Lecter is the way he is; it leaves open the possibility that it anyone could become such a monster. I imagine people had their own theories, and when something like that is left to the reader's imagination, it can assume many shapes. When Harris gives us Lecter's backstory, as unusual as it may be, he forever closes the door on our possibilities, and thereby reduces Lecter as a villain, although he does perhaps become somewhat more sympathetic a character. I don't think we needed to know *why* Lecter is evil; it is enough to simply know that he is.	2003-01-14

And I'm sorry I waited so long to find that out.<br />The interweaving of the narratives, sometimes skipping back a day or two to have one character's perspective &quot;catch up&quot; to another's was masterfully done. No sooner is one moment of suspense reached than we switch to someone else's current adventure, and the tension starts building all over again.<br />Some people think that the book wanders away from the action too much, but I didn't find that to be a problem. The characters and atmosphere are so well written that any &quot;background&quot; information blends well into the plot itself.<br />The only thing I found that slowed me down a bit was Van Helsing's broken English. However, once I got used to his style of speaking, it wasn't much of a hinderance to the pace.<br />One aspect of the book that I especially appreciated is the fact that Mina Murray Harker is such a strong character. In the (1931) movie, she mostly looks winsome and cries. In this novel, she's a much bigger part of the action, actively participating in the mission to destroy Count Dracula even as she falls under his spell herself.<br />I'm glad I finally read this book and had the opportunity to experience &quot;Dracula&quot; as its author intended the story to be told.	2003-01-14

There are also many intriguing stories about peripheral figures such as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Kennedy (find out just how he won the election), and Sam Giancana, to name just a few.<br />While Levy does not hesitate to point out the mistakes and faults of each man, this biography is neither sensational nor muck raking. One gets a sense that while the author is somewhat sympathetic towards his subjects (especially Peter Lawford, who was exiled by Frank Sinatra in a sad case of \\"shoot the messenger\\") he is also quite able to portray them objectively. Between the wild lives of its subjects and Levy's solid writing, this is a very enjoyable read.	2002-12-31

Looked at from that perspective, it's not bad at all. The O'Hara's are, for the most part, lively characters and well written. Aunts Pauline and Eulalie and horrid old Grandfather are the people you like to hate, and Eleanor Butler is a kindly woman with whom we have an enjoyable visit.<br />The problem comes, of course, when you look at the fact that this *is* a sequel to GWTW, a book that Margaret Mitchell herself never wanted written (she was adamant that the story ended with Rhett leaving Scarlett, and that was that). Ripley wisely does not spend too much time with the characters Mitchell created, instead whisking Scarlett off for adventures with Rhett's family, her own Irish cousins, and her mother's family in Charleston.<br />As I said, I found the characters well-drawn and the story absorbing in and of itself. The settings seem well researched and written with a good amount of detail. It's an enjoyable read.<br />As a big fan of GWTW, I must admit some satisfaction at the continuation of Scarletrt's story, and her eventual reunion with Rhett; however, this is always tempered with the small, niggling feeling that this story, entertaining as it may be, is not anything Margaret Mitchell would have written, or wanted written by anyone else.	2002-12-31

I was immediately drawn into the story and stayed completely absorbed until the last page. As others have mentioned, the book is much darker than the movie, and more complex as well. I went back and read the last chapter over a few times just to savor the ending again. The first time it was so startling that I couldn't quite believe what I had read.

Well, Natalie lead a dramatic life, so maybe some flowery prose isn't entirely out of place.<br />I read on a Natalie Wood website that her oldest daughter, Natasha Gregson Wagner, has dismissed the book as \\"trash,\\" saying the information was just \\"gathered from a lot of gossip columns,\\" although in the same breath she admits she hasn't actually read the book. Actually, Finstad interviewed a large number of people who were close to Natalie both personally and professionally, from the time she was a small child, and the text is very well documented with her source notes. Such complete documentation is rarely found in Hollywood biographies these days, and is very impressive, in my opinion.<br />All in all, I agree with Natalie's sister Lana that this book is \\"comprehensive, moving, shocking and riveting,\\" and recommend it to both long time and new Natalie Wood fans.	2002-08-28

Ann is assigned to write a story about several missing girls from Washington state...and the reader gets a front row view of not only the investigations, but Ann's growing horror and revulsion as she realized that the person responsible for these terrible murders is her good friend, Ted.<br />Ted escapes, and Ann is guarded by FBI agents in case he tries to come to her for help in escaping. Ted calls Ann collect from Florida after being arrested and suspected of the Chi Omega murders, and hints that he would confess all to her. These and many other chilling stories provide a unique, highly personal view into Bundy's destructive life and drawn-out death.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-08-13
US	52599407	R33LM4VC21S66U	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Extraordinary	It's hard to find the right words to describe this book...reading it is an experience no one should miss. I would have liked more resolution for the ending but it also reminded me that stories like this, whether fictional or real, rarely have all the loose threads tied up. Still, it was a wonderful read and an amazing first novel.	2002-07-18

I've always been fascinated by Truman Capote, and Clarke has done a wonderful job of bringing him to life in a very balanced, human way.	2002-05-25

Incoming!<br />If you bought this book to learn more about Judy Garland, as I did, save your money; or better yet, buy Gerald Clarke's excellent biography \\"Get Happy.\\"<br />The first half of the book, up until Judy's death, is nothing we haven't heard before, except painted with a whole lot of whitewash. Vincente Minelli's relationships with men? Didn't happen. Sid Luft lost money gambling? Totally false. Judy resented Louis B. Mayer and her mother? Of course not. Most of the other stories we've heard over the years? Not true. Her proof for any of this? None; the stories are, it seems, not true mostly because she doesn't want them to be.<br />One thing I found quite offensive is Luft's characterization of her mother's gay fans as \\"Garland Freaks.\\" She goes on to mention later that there's nothing wrong with homosexuality, but by then the damage was done, in my opinion. According to Luft, pretty much everyone who was around her mother at the end was a sleazy hanger-on. Well, at least they were there; by her own admission, Luft did not see Judy at all for the last 10 months of her life, having decamped to California to live with her father.<br />After writing of her mother's death, Luft launches into the story of the rest of her life, which sadly isn't all that interesting. She did a lot of drugs. She hung out at Studio 54. She performed. Oh, and she knew famous people. A *lot* of famous people. Whose names are mentioned. Often. Every one of them is, of course, a \\"dear friend.\\" She'll show you pictures to prove it. Yada yada whatever.<br />Luft is honest about her drug problems, but much more honest, in much more detail, about her sister Liza's drug problems. Luft \\"treats\\" us to every sordid detail about Liza's problems and attempts at rehab. Luft's own rehab? To hear her tell it, not much to write home about. It's a pretty blatant attempt to whitewash her own problems while making her sister look as bad as possible.<br />Save your time. Luft's intentions may have been good (and I have my doubts about that; ride the coat tails much?), but she falls short of the mark here..<br />Save your time. Luft's intentions may have been good (and I have my doubts about that; ride the coat tails much?), but she falls short of the mark here.	2002-05-15
US	52599407	R2X0SKMOCWGKKG	0385489102	424706370	The Rasputin File	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Fascinating book, but oh, the grammar!	I'd give this book five stars if only it was better written. The new information the author has found on Rasputin is extremely interesting and dispels many long-held myths. However, one thing that constantly got on my nerves and interrupted the smoothness of the reading is the awful grammar. Every other sentence starts with &quot;and&quot; or &quot;but&quot; or &quot;so&quot; and is an incomplete sentence. An example from pages 76-77:<br />&quot;And it presumably then that they took him [Rasputin] to the child [Alexei]. Because it was afterwards that the tsar wrote his rapturous letter to Stolypin asking him to allow the peasant to 'bless your injured daughter with the icon.' For in their eyes, evidently, a miracle had taken place. The kind Vyrubova would later recount. And that would take place many times.<br />&quot;In the half-light of Alexei's room illuminated by the lamps in front of the icons, their 'Little One,' their 'Sunbeam,' had not been able to fall asleep, tormented as he was by his latest attack. And the strange peasant went to his crib. And his huge crooked shadow bent over the boy in prayer. And before their eyes the boy grew calmer and quietly fell asleep. To wake up healthy the next morning. (A miracle! A miracle!)&quot;<br />I thought at first the author chose this style to place emphasis on certain thoughts by separating them into smaller sentence fragments, but this awkward style continues through out the entire book! It irritated me to the point where I'd have to put the book aside for awhile. I always went back to it, however, because the story itself is, as mentioned, very interesting.<br />I recommend this book, if the writing style wouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the story itself.	2002-03-22

I got this book for Christmas, and less than a month later I've already made 3 of the recipes and enjoyed them all very much. It didn't occur to me until I read this book that you could make desserts in the steamer as well as entrees, and those have turned out great as well. If you can find a copy of this book, by all means, buy it. The receipes are simple, easy and delicious.	2002-01-17
US	52599407	R15JUI2PNXYXHY	0385415338	808014509	The Great One: The Life and Legend of Jackie Gleason	Books	3	22	22	N	N	Seems well researched but bitter	As far as I know, this is the only biography written by someone who was not a friend of Gleason's, and it shows. While the book is well-researched, the author takes an inordinate amount of pleasure in pointing out as many of Gleason's faults as he can. I was left with the impression that the author was jealous that Gleason enjoyed such enormous success despite not always being a pleasant person.<br />Audrey Meadows commented at the end of her book &quot;Love, Alice&quot; that the author skewered Gleason for not living up to his (the author's) standards, and that sounds about right. To pay Meadows back for this, the author tries to discredit her story about how she won the role of Alice on &quot;The Honeymooners,&quot; but only ends up looking vindictive again, as Meadows has published the photos taken of herself auditioning for Alice that prove her story true. This is only one of several instances where Henry tries to attack people who try to disagree with his negative view of Gleason.<br />There are many instances in the book of phrases like &quot;Gleason said...&quot; or &quot;Gleason often commented...&quot; but very few of these quotes are backed up with any kind of source in the text itself, and there are no endnotes in the book. In addition, many other people quoted in the book are identified only as &quot;colleagues,&quot; with no one specific being cited as the source(s) of many of the stories about how horrible Gleason really was.<br />I noted the comments from various celebrities on the back of the dust jacket, and was surprised to hear praise from people who call themselves Gleason's friends. It makes you wonder just what kinds of friends they were.	2002-01-08
US	52599407	R17N8H94PXC5Z0	0679735771	92932803	American Psycho	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Gaaaaaaaaaaah!	I think the reviewer who said &quot;liked the book, but now I have brain damage&quot; said it best.<br />The book is hard to put down, whether you find yourself transfixed by Ellis's prolific &quot;product placements,&quot; (which I admit I did---so many brand names!) or the incredibly gory violence (which also transfixed me, especially when trying to fall asleep at night).<br />That being said, I'm still not sure whether I'd call it a good book or not. A good *read*, yes, but that doesn't necessarily make the book itself good. If you want something to hold your attention, this book will do it.	2001-12-27
US	52599407	R2947RBVAI5SDZ	0393038335	971519218	Laughter's Gentle Soul: The Life of Robert Benchley	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Sweet and fluffy, which is not nescessarily a bad thing	After reading Marion Meade's &quot;Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This?&quot;, I bought this book to learn more about Robert Benchley, which I did.<br />Meade, who spared little if anything when writing about Parker (which made for an excellent read) pulled no punches with Benchley, either. Described in detail are his good and bad (i.e., womanizing) qualities.<br />Altman definitely takes a gentler view of Benchley, which from what I've read here and elsewhere, is what the world in general seemed to do; Benchley's messy personal life never seemed to detract from his image, with the public as well as with friends, of a genial, kind, sweet and funny family man.<br />Other reviewers have criticized Altman for not going more into depth about what kind of person Benchley was and what made him that way, but in this age of trashy, spare-no-detail celebrity biographies, I didn't think that was always a negative attribute.<br />All in all, I enjoyed this book, in large part for the good quantity of Benchley's work featured therein. You may not get all the dirty details, but in the case of Robert Benchley, I didn't really want them.	2001-12-21

I couldn't get more than a third of the way through this book, though, because of the author's rambling style. His run-on sentences can make you dizzy, and he'll go off on tangents in footnotes about the most irrelevant things. For example, there was a foot note that took up *half a page* about one detective marginally involved in the investigation: who his father was, how he'd joined the force, and a story about some big time gangster he'd busted---none of which had anything to do with the story of Starr Faithfull. I hope one day to be able to plow through the whole book, but for now I just set it aside.	2001-07-12

And Keppel does not disappoint: he got confessions out of Bundy that probably no one else could, things Bundy himself admitted he never intended to tell anyone. I skipped over the Green River Killer parts, and I think Keppel might have been better off writing separate books about his Green River experiences and his experiences with Bundy (which would make a fascinating book in their own right).	2001-07-12

For one thing, he tells it like it is: whether it's refusing to shake hands with a senator who opposed the Missing Children Act, or telling the story of the &quot;scumbag&quot; that made him decide to host America's Most Wanted. He pulls no punches, and I love that.<br />I had no idea what a large role Walsh has played in creating and promoting legislation for missing and exploited children until I read this book. I always knew he was an amazing man, I just didn't realize just how large a debt we, as society, owe him for the work he has done.<br />Read this book. It will change the way you think about the police, the FBI, politicians, and many other things. It will make you want to get out there and help people, make a difference...I know it did for me.	2001-03-22

I got some idea what a surprise suspect Bundy was (clean cut, law student, no record, etc.) from Ann Rule's &quot;The Stranger Beside Me,&quot; but Kendall was even more involved in the investigations...and more often ignored. There were so many instances when it seemed that if the police had only taken her more seriously, Bundy would have been stopped much sooner. It's frightening how often and how strongly Kendall and Bundy were drawn back to each other. I admire her for pulling her life together in the midst of such chaos.	2001-03-01

Being passionate about your opposition to the death penalty is one thing; speaking of a monster like Bundy as &quot;my Ted&quot; and buying him a Mickey Mouse watch when you go to Disneyland is something else. However, this does give a detailed look at Bundy's case from the judicial perspective, which hasn't been covered much before. Most people seem to want to read about the details of Bundy's gruesome crimes; if you've read all those books and want a new perspective, this is a worthwhile read.	2001-02-23
