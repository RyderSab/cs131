Now he recollects memorable moments and reveals his behind-the-scenes experiences in this thoughtfully written autobiography.<br /><br />Less of a \\"tell all\\" and more of a \\"tell ABOUT,\\" Tab recounts encounters with an amazing array of friends, lovers and co-stars.  Film buffs will especially enjoy reading anecdotes about Tallulah Bankhead, Natalie Wood, Sophia Loren, Debbie Reynolds, Gwen Verdon and Anthony Perkins--with whom Tab had a secret, intimate relationship.<br /><br />Tab never sells out.  Though now open about his sexuality, he remains a staunch Catholic with some pretty conservatives views about marriage, sexuality, politics and fame.  It makes for exceptionally compelling reading in this day and age of celebrity-driven headlines.<br /><br />Great collection of photos, too, that show Tab was (and is) more than mere beefcake!	2005-10-05

Much more affordable---)<br /><br />There is no doubt that author Maccullogh is a first class scholar when it comes to religion in the Tudor Age; however, I faced the same woeful problem with this book that I encountered on his masterful and massive work on my own ancestor, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer--and that is that the attention to infintesimal detail is constructed in such density that it makes for unfortunately slow reading.  It's almost like reading a text book...and spending an entire semester on a course in Edwardian Reformation.  A historian he is.  A storyteller, no.<br /><br />However, those who would dismiss Edward as merely a \\"boy king\\" with a short reign would be well advised to take some time with this work and discover how much of a serious and lasting impact he did manage to have on politics and religion.	2005-09-01

This is truly less of a political work than it is a glittering expression of a smart, savvy, sartorial professional New York gal who obviously speaks her mind first, last and always.  And her editors have had the good sense to ensure that her \\"voice\\" is translated into some of the wittiest writing I've ever read.<br /><br />Regardless of your political POV, you don't need a bush to enjoy this wonderful can't-put-down book.  I literally devoured it in a single sitting, only putting it down long enough to laugh out loud.  It is THAT funny.  And it would be even funnier if it weren't so tragically accurate about the state of our society.<br /><br />Please God, don't let author Aschenbrand become a victim of her own intuition and certain success...we need her voice to remain unadulterated!<br /><br />If you're an uptight neurotic, you will hate it but be compelled to continue turning every page.  If you read it with even only a somewhat open mind, you will treasure it and want to pass it on.<br /><br />Run to the bookstore or click on something fast and buy this little gem!	2005-08-16

Veteran soap & thriller writer Racina combines the best of both his worlds wth this juicy read, perfect for vacation or a long plane trip.  He imagines the City of Angels undergoing a \\"deep freeze\\" and all the disasterous consequences that would follow---of course, complicated by various sublots with an assortment of colorful characters.<br /><br />He knows L.A. and he knows showbiz, so he is particularly good with his characterizations and dialogue.  It also helps that he penned the famous \\"Ice Princess\\" storyline in GENERAL HOSPITAL's heyday, so he's more than familiar with what happens when a metropolis undergoes a meteorological snafu!<br /><br />Lots of fun to add to your beach bag or summer cottage library collection!	2005-08-14

On the surface, this looks like a campy book on the tragi-comedy of beauty in our pop-culture obssessed universe, but it is far more...brilliantly, so!<br /><br />Snappy chapters with wonderful accompanying photographic artwork bounce from destination to destination, the wry and witty author taking the reader on a \\"beauty trip\\" through the mid 1990s sensibility.  It remains a timeless take on our perceptions and hangups about youth and good looks, but it also serves as a marvelous time capsule of life in 1995.<br /><br />Definitely try to find a copy of this bemusing read.  It is way more than a coffee table accoutrement.  It might just make you take a look in the mirror...and see more than just the reflection staring back at you!	2005-08-11

It was pretty dry to get through and I suppose it was a combination of the writing and the material (I was more of a DC guy, growing up).<br /><br />It did little to pique my interest in the FF beyond the rudimentary knowledge I already had from the 60's/70's cartoon series and the recent hype surrounding the movie.

I am an older fan of the nostalgic Golden and Silver Age versions (which are respectfully included and acknowledged here), so it was more of a detached learning experience than a loving trip down memory lane for me.  However, the art work and accompanying prose will delight all of Wonder Woman's readers/admirers.<br /><br />Too bad there was nary a mention of Lynda Carter's indelible image of the TV version, who somehow managed to permanently influence the way artists and fans perceive the essence of both Diana Prince AND Wonder Woman.  There is one sentence that mentions the lyrics from the TV theme song, but that is it.	2005-07-23

There's really nothing new in here whatsoever...it's essentially all a rehash of other Crawford biographies, interspersed with lots of the star's prodigous correspondence.  The letters in this work are only to a handful of different recipients, so it's hard to piece together much insight and they soon become monotonous.<br /><br />The author is obviously a great admirer of the late, great Joan Crawford...as evidenced by her repeated jabs at the poison-pen of Christina \\"Mommie Dearest\\" Crawford.  Unfortunately, it does little to redeem the maligned Oscar winner's tarnished reputation as an abusive parent.  Even the Foreword by Crawford's own grandchild is too short and undeveloped to be of interest.<br /><br />Very obviously self published, this book is thus way overpriced considering it offers no new or particularly dazzling information.  I could only recommend it to someone just starting out in his/her discovery of the Crawford mystique.  There are plenty of other, better biographies available...which Vogel quotes liberally.	2005-07-15

I ordered this book with great anticipation and excitement, as an avid (Okay, \\"obsessed\\") recreational runner.  I checked the mailbox every day until it arrived...  I dove right into it the first night.<br /><br />The fact that it took so many repeated sit-downs to get through it is the biggest indication of this book's unfortunate lack of appeal for me.  There is a bit of a dated (1978) soap opera feel to it and it's often way overwritten, which makes me suspect a chronic use of Roget's Thesaurus.  The author obviously knows first-hand the trials, tribulations, joys and anguishes of competitive running---but so much of that gets lost in the fiction of the plot.<br /><br />I KNOW this is a cult classic for runners, but it was sadly lost on THIS runner.  I wanted more about the experience and emotion of being a runner, rather than the made-up drama and shenanigans of an imagined one.<br /><br />The best passages were those descriptive ones specifically dealing with the act of running. Those pure and identifiable moments are worth highlighting and saving to reread the next time you have a PR to beat or rival to best!	2005-06-29

This fast paced account of the 8 man team of Nazis sent to sabotage  the US railyway system during WWII is so colorfully told, it's like a movie.

However, often the writing comes off as over inflated and grande--exactly the opposite of her image as the fun loving girl you'd like to hang out with in your spare time.  That pretension unfortunately makes her many good deeds and loving heart seem like they are theidle amusments of someone rich, privileged and bored.  That's not Goldie!<br /><br />I believe the book could have benefitted from more Editorial guidance and, hopefully, this beloved brainy, bubbly blonde will write more books in the future...with a more down to earth and inclusive narrative.	2005-06-19

The fact that it is officially sanctioned by the Dean family estate cannot go unnoticed---it is almost embarrassing in the heaps of praise it bestows on every member of the clan and is sure to point out \\"important\\" points like the facts that they were not beneficiaries of Dean's life insurance policy (I'm sure they're making out fine) and that any liability for his fatal car crash could not possibly have been his.  It admits to one homosexual affair on Dean's behalf and the friendly likelihood that he may have dabbled in others, but  it strongly defends the notion that James Dean was a heterosexual in the first degree.  Right or wrong, there are lots of assumptions and speculations which ultimately boil down to mere commentary.<br /><br />While the text tends to read like a bio written by the President of the James Dean Fan Club, the real star of the show is the artwork.  A great photographic collection although there is a large picture of Dean horsing around on the set of GIANT with a young woman.  The caption identifies this woman as his good pal Elizabeth Taylor and it is amazing that ANY editor, proofreader or person involved in the process of creating this book didn't notice that it is most definitely NOT Elizabeth Taylor.  It is probably her stand-in.  It makes the accuracy of other \\"facts\\" somewhat dubious.<br /><br />It's getting a big promotional push, but I think it's overhyped and you're best off purchasing it as a bargain pre-owned price from an Amazon Marketplace merchant, rather than shelling out full price for new.	2005-06-17

It's all the more stunning to recognize how many of his accomplishments have since been done in.<br /><br />It's unfortunate he did not have a more trusted advisor to judiciously edit this work...it could have been a more compelling read, instead of akin to going through his Daily Planner.  Even so, it remains important historical, political reading and is clearly told in Bill Clinton's ever optimistic voice.	2004-12-27

I liked Tatum O'Neal, the actress AND the celebrity, much better before reading this stagey confessional which seems not-too-expertly ghost written and heavy on the name-dropping and \\"Daddy Dearest\\" appeal of showbiz tomes.<br /><br />Not that it isn't interesting...great airplane or beach fare.  However, I'm sure it's meant to be more of an eye-opening look at familial addiction amidst the jungles of Tinseltown.  It just comes off as phony and uninspiring, though many of my fellow amazon reviewers appear to disagree.  This pretty, talented lady would be much better off walking the walk, it seems to me, than talking the talk and slamming other people in the process.  But that doesn't always sell books.	2004-12-08

The \\"Greatest Generation\\" is put to a test in this imagined conspiracy theory to put an Anti-Semite into the White House as a pawn for Hitler.<br /><br />Loaded with fascinating detail based on actual historical figures and events, this clever and engaging novel is also heartbreakingly poignant at times and especially relevant in the time of war and suspicion in which the world is currently living today.	2004-11-25

Bob Greene's breezy, nostalgic journey to chat with 5 of our former Chief Executives is a great book to give as a gift, or to pleasantly pass the time in a single sitting.  His enthusiasm and humor shine through in his chatty chapters with Nixon, Carter and Ford...all three statesmen come off as interesting, intelligent men (even Nixon with his always astounding idiosyncracies).  With the elder Bush, however, Greene seems to have less to work with, so fills out the chapter with his own reflections on the man and his legacy.  The final chapter, on Ronald Reagan, is certainly poignant as no interview was possible due to the onset of Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />Greene is a great writer and I'd suggest a follow up on either the former First Ladies or the women of the Senate, entitled SORORITY.	2004-11-09

Thought provoking and often laugh-out-loud hysterical, this smart and savvy little book will compel you to finish it in a single sitting!  Author Crimmins manages to cover a vast array of anthropological topics and how they have been developed and/or influenced by the homosexual community.<br /><br />While not all the examples of how gays \\"saved civilization\\" will surprise every reader, the book is a delightful look at how present gay culture is (and always has been) in the world.  Her writing is bright, frank and instantly engaging.  The fact that she is a heterosexual mom with a great affection for her subject matter makes her oh-so charming, where a lesser writer's words might only manage to shock and incite.<br /><br />This is a book that gay and gay-friendly readers will enjoy.  More importantly, it is a book that the unenlightened SHOULD be reading.	2004-10-10

Instead, this is a hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time without even a satirical or titillating plotline to make you want to turn the page.  It actually IS a book you can put down.  It doesn't manage to fall into the category of beach reading, although you might want to throw it in the ocean.<br /><br />Pam deserves better....Her co-writer could have come up with something more Jackie Collins-esque.  Was the BAYWATCH babe playing it too safe, trying to straddle the fence between sexpot and respectable author?  I think probably so.  Too bad for her readers and/or fans.  If the subject matter weren't so distasteful, it would suit the pre-teen girl demographic but instead it is just a story adrift.	2004-08-16

Well, I grabbed THE FACE thinking I'd amuse myself with a fun, fast paced suspense thriller.  Having never read any of Koontz's prior works, I wasn't prepared for this strange mixture of genres: detective meets supernatural.<br /><br />I won't give away any of the plot points in case this is your kind of book...it wasn't mine.  I will say, however, that good story structure and interesting characterizations wre overshadowed by corny dialogue, incessant pop culture references and some of the most repugnant, sadistic scenarios I've ever read in a work of fiction.  If this were a movie, it would be rated NC-17.<br /><br />If you like angels and demons with your cops and killers, you will enjoy this.

I was so overwhelmingly disappointed with her &quot;Isle of Dogs,&quot; as a departure that I decided to give her Jack the Ripper foray a read. I found it rather dull and, more strikingly, short on fact and rife with conjecture. That's no way for a criminalist to report!<br /><br /> Most of the 350+ pages are spent with &quot;what if's&quot; and extranneous fodder on modern CSI. She does not make a solid case against artists Sickert.<br /><br /> The Ripper slayings remain fascinating and, as many believe unlike Cornwall, unsolved.	2004-07-23

Major events in her life are stunningly dramatic, but the politics of Elizabethean England and the courts of Europe are painted so as to slow down the momentum of the personal tale of the tragic monarch.<br /><br /> Worth having for your collection and impressively researched and compiled, but not necessarily a pleasure-read for the casual Anglophile.	2004-07-23

The translation and editing are excellent and the reader almost can feel the claustrophobia of life in the bunker, and the clock ticking down to their ultimate defeat.<br />Most fascinating and enfuriating is the very human side of the Fuhrer detailed by the author.  He is often depicted as pedenatic...a frail, old gentleman, polite and artistic, rather than the mad annihilator we know him to truly have been.  This contributes, of course, to the always impossible to understand appeal of his message to the masses.<br />Historians and buffs alike will be compelled to read this very interesting, detailed account of one woman's experiences of life inside the Third Reich.	2004-06-04

Veteran newscaster Brokaw made me weep with THE GREATEST GENERATION, so I had high hopes for this one.  Undoubtedly, his essays are thoughtfully, honestly written and he is both a gentleman and a scholar.  However, this work is often too self indulgent (as autobiographical works can be!) to evoke much emotion from the average reader.  For example: It's hard to get too choked up over his financial struggles in the post-Depression midwest when, in the same sentence, he mentions negotiating a multi-million dollar contract or his sprawling Manhattan condo.<br />I look forward to adding more of Brokaw's works to my library, and hope he will devote a good portion of his upcoming retirement from the Nightly News to writing!	2003-12-17

I suspect that author Highsmith was feeling more comfortable with expressing her own sexuality by the time she wrote this entertaining little mystery, as the homoeroticism is downright blatant!  However, I think I preferred it more subtle for the charismatic Tom Ripley.  I mean, having him revel in going in drag to a gay bar seemed extremely out of character, if not downright ridiculous.

Unfortunately, much of it seems only that: his opinion and theory.  As interesting as the work of the prolific Highsmith continues to be, the writer herself comes off pretty thoroughly unlovable and not altogether fascinating.  The good news, however, is that the biography succeeds in stimulating one's desire to explore Highsmith's works beyond the RIPLEY stories and STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.

It wasn't bogged down with a lot of technical alien/interplanetary mumbo jumbo.  It actually had a story and some interesting character development.  The pay off wasn't quite what I was hoping for, however, so it tended to come off in the end as a long episode of a sci fi show a la STAR TREK.

The miraculous Helen Keller and her equally astounding teacher, Annie Sullivan, go into great detail of their struggles to overcome Helen's grave disabilities.  It is so astounding, in fact, that it's almost incomprehensible.  Helen's amazing mental ability, Annie's guidance and their mutual tenacity are surely to be credited.<br />It is a wonderful story to read, especially so because it is told BY them and not as interpreted by a third-party biographer.<br />Unfortunately, Helen's eloquence and the prose of the day can border on the flowery side (to be it mildly) which made me unable to push through as quickly as I might have otherwise.<br />But then again, that's the beauty of her success story: it WASN'T too good to be true!	2003-08-03

This diary-like book is authored by the surviving brother of a World War II casualty from the wreck of the HMT Rhona.  The Rhona's story is one of the war's best kept and tragic secrets and Bennett's book, while it could have benefitted from more extensive editing, is a moving tribute to his brother and the other 1,000+ men who perished when she was attacked.  Interesting, bittersweet reading.	2003-07-26

The fact that the huge loss of life and the subsequent cover-up of the details surrounding it make for fascinating and disturbing reading.<br />Limited publications exist on the subject, so this is a valuable resource for interested historians, although the book itself is rather impersonal and seems to suffer from misguided editing...especially the final chapter which becomes strangely sentimental.	2003-07-22

Readers will see what an arduous task it was to adapt as a screenplay...and what a commendable job they (and the director &amp; stars) did, as well.  Since virutally no one nowadays will read the book first, it serves as an interesting character study into the psychology of the Jane and Blanche characters.

Her &quot;memories&quot; of the Black Dahlia murder, however, are highly dubious...if her case were as strong as she claims, she wouldn't be relegated to this kind of pulp work that is so over-the-top disgusting that it is impossible to read.  I found myself having to skip portions of graphic torture too heinous to digest.

The book gets bogged down in the last hundred pages with a plethora of distracting, but pertinent detail.  Most amazing is the fact that the abused son of a brutal killer could turn out to be such an articulate, thoughtful writer and law enforcer.

It could have benefitted greatly from more thorough editing...and one of my pet peeves that ended up distracting me throughout was the incessant use of the word \\"friend(s).\\"  Check it out: barely a paragraph goes by without describing someone that way (Newt & Monica not withstanding).

As much as you'd like it to be, it's not a celebrity bio---nor is it some blithe beach read.  It's a surprisingly interesting spiritual diary of the popular TV actor.  While the journal-esuqe aspect of this quick read is decidedly &quot;New Age-y,&quot; it deserves attention and respect for, not only the personal enlightenment &amp; self discovery of the well known author, but the important messages about love and tolerances it tries valiantly to convey.	2003-06-23

Line by line, or a paragraph at a time, the writing is Hemingway at his best.  Yet, inexplicably, I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next, the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest.  There is much, however, that is worth the time...themes of monogamous love, war/conscience, life/death.  The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he-man's mastery to convey softer, &quot;feminine&quot; sensitivity.  Definitely not the one to kick off a reader's Hemingway exposure.	2003-05-06

Since the reputation of Lucrezia Borgia is certainly more notorious than the woman, herself, it was fascinating to get a glimpse (however much fictional license was admittedly taken) of a more human/inhuman person.  The time period, chain of global events and relgious history are all of great interest to buffs such as myself and author Faunce vividly colors his characters, their crimes and the world in which they exist.  I was happily surprised by all the twists and turns...both fictitious and actual.<br />This work is reminiscent of Maragaret George's fantastic THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF HENRY VIII and I recommend it to anyone interested in an absorbing read about the infamous Borgia family.	2003-04-10

The incredible, gripping autobiography of author Lehmann, the \\"last courier\\" to Adolf Hitler in his infamous bunker, tells his story with sensitivity and brave candor.  This large volume is constantly fascinating for WW2 enthusiasts, especially because of his unique perspective as a German \\"insider.\\"  Lehmann's wit and wisdom are apparent throughout and one particular paragraph stood out for me as a summation of his message:  \\"How difficult it must be for all those who live in a democracy, used to a free press and to open exchange of opinions, used to a multiple-party system or, at least, to a two-party system, to understand the one track mind of youth in a dictatorship.\\"  Eye opening and candid, this is work of passion and immense detail...not to be missed.

A compelling account, it frequently lacks the emotional, human element found in works such as A NIGHT TO REMEMBER or DAY OF INFAMY by Walter Lord.  It is not until the Epilogue that Preston's own personal slant enters the text and, for me, it was that point of view that was missing from the bulk of the book.  Still, it is a fascinating and meticulously researched work of historical importance.	2002-11-05

This wonderful old read reminded me of the religious twin of Maugham's OF HUMAN BONDAGE: a historical soap opera which keeps you hooked chapter after chapter.  Not only does the reader stay engaged by the Peyton Place roster of characters and situations, one also gets an insight into world Catholicism in the first half of the 20th Century.  As interesting as it is entertaining!  Makes me want to go back and take a look at the campy Otto Preminger movie version starring Tom Tryon and Carol Lynley!	2002-10-25

I came across this book while developing my &quot;Brains and Brawn Workout&quot; program.  Next time you're working out, pause to consider ways to exercise your brain, as well.  Like other parts of the body, the brain definitely falls into the \\"use it or lose it\\" category as scientific evidence continues to prove.  In fact, it is celebrated as \\"the most sophisticated learning machine the world has ever known.\\"<br />This book by Gamon &amp; Bragdon, published by BrainWaves Books, offers recent discoveries, practical applications, performance tests and skill-building exercises to make sure your mental capacity stays in the same tip-top shape as your physique.  Easily applicable facts and a touch of humor combine to enlighten and explain ways to heighten your own genetic mental capacity.  Whether it's learning tricks for remembering names and other career/social building data, or discovering how caffeine, cramming, nicotine and sleep affect one's academic skills, this fun to read book will give you something to think about (even if it's while you're on the StairMaster!).<br />Three sections divide the book:  The Developing Brain (the third trimester through high school), The Maturing Years (from college to retirement) and The Experienced Mind (maintaining treasured qualities of life).  The authors declare it as \\"a sourcebook of current scientific information with practical advice on how to speed and consolidate learning and recall, to build competence, confidence and mental productivity for oneself and for others.\\"  Everyone can garner benefits from their expertise without ever feeling the drag of a medical textbook.	2002-10-25

While some of the recollections should be taken with a grain of salt, this autobiography is a compelling and impressive read from the woman who is arguably the greatest living photographic artist.  And what a witness to history!  Love her or hate her, her talents are irrefutable...as great as the controversy that continues to swirl around her!  Don't miss out on this read!	2002-05-13

Never dull, it is remarkably wholesome in spite of &quot;sordid&quot; subject matter.  If it's a G-rated romance/soap opera novel you're after, this is a good choice.  Not racy enough to be a LIFETIME movie, it will at least be good company on that cross-country airline ride!	2002-03-29

Not only does it make me appreciate how fantastic the original GODFATHER film was/is, but I was blown away by how fantastic the book is...even/especially now!  Absolutely compelling from start to finish, exquisitely researched and written.  What a story!  What characters!  And even though I experienced the film and book in reverse chronology, they are perfect companions...  I'm compelled to read more Puzo, yet worried I may be let down...this was so much fun!

This expertly written adventure tale is still as amusing and &quot;page-turning&quot; for the adult reader as it was when it was first made required reading in junior high school.

Unfortunately, this valiant effort is Wayyyy over-shadowed by the TITANIC hype thrust upon popular culture by James Cameron's film.  This is a sweet and well told story from a young person's POV, with real-life characters and events blended with fiction.  However, after all the info on the subject with which we've been inundated, this little book ends up seeming trivial at best.  The author makes, ironically, the same mistake as Cameron...the best TITANIC stories are the ones who focus on the REAL LIFE characters and not their made-up counterparts.	2001-09-30

From funny little Truman Capote came this classic and extraordinary novel detailing a horrific true-crime case.  Consistently gripping and a chilling anthorpological study.

You won't be able to stop from turning page after page of this terrifying tale.  Be warned that some of the content is so ghastly, so sick and so graphic that it WILL offend you (it should, anyway).

Steamy, shocking, a page turner! Ok, there's a lot of unintentional humor now that times have changed, but there's never a dull moment. As is always the case, far superior to the movie adaptation.	2001-08-24

Amazingly talented filmmaker Riefenstahl has written a remarkable and interesting autobiography...although a clear message of &quot;Who, me?&quot; seems to run throughout. Nonetheless, it is a compelling work by and about one of the 20th Century's most enigmatic and notorious historical figures. Rumors still exist that Jodie Foster's interested in a movie version...	2001-08-24

Nine very different women with remarkable similarities that cross partisan  lines.

Not a skeptic of Reincarnation, I was looking forward to adding this book to my TITANIC collection.  Unfortunately, the poor quality of both the printing and the photographs took away from my enjoyment (not to mention  typos!).  In the author's defense, she has an interesting, meritous story  to tell and certainly seems to relish sharing it in her comfortable,  conversational style.	1999-08-25

I read this in one sitting because I love the dishy Hollywood element.  Lots of backstage stories about famous stars and written with candor.  I wish there'd been more photos, but the ones that ARE in the book are fun  and rare!  Great summer reading.	1999-05-22
