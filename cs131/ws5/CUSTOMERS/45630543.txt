It's pretty clear that this book was written to entertain at least as much as to enlighten and it is all the more enjoyable for it.  Presenting all sides to a story of conflict is the job of historical reference not historical fiction.  McCulloughs presentation of the man and his adversaries do a fantastic job of illustrating why Caesar is such an enduring legend.  He was a one-man revolution against weak willed politicians.  Even the figures cast as less than heroic are presented in a very human light.  <br /> <br />The factual aspects of her book, espcially the uprising of unified Gaul are things that we should all be familiar with.  They represent the same geopolitical themes that dominate the news today.   <br /> <br />Not only are her maps and diagrams enlightening, but the fact that they are hand drawn and annotated support the feeling this is history as taught by one wonderful teacher. <br /> <br />If I have a gripe, it's only that the book IS a part of a series and it seems to be selling the sequels and prequels by perhaps leaving the reader hanging a bit.  Its 600+ pages does not finish off the story of Caesar but lands a couple years short.	2005-10-01

Shadow Divers is not just a vivid reminder about how exposed our homeland was to our enemies just a short 60 years ago, but also about how everyday people with everyday flaws and problems can rise to a challenge or just crumble. How adversity can turn bitterness to friendship and shallowness to depth. <br /> <br />The only pause from page turning adventure and problem solving is spent developing our familiarity with the key players in the story.  Kurson shows the humanity behind the men and loved ones of the men who bravely executed their leaders futile instructions. <br /> <br />First and foremost it is a thrilling mystery-adventure-history, but the character development Kurson crafted will make you care enough to feel an emotional effect. <br /> <br />Though not dwelt upon at length, the story of the Rouse's is especially poignant and (at least in my mind) does something very unusual; it introduced a heroic figure who's name was never even mentioned.

I found it to be incredibly well written and thought it had excellent character development (with the exception of the protagonist Roark, who was too unusual to connect with in real time.) It is engaging and easy to read.    More important is how often I find myself thinking \\"what would Howard do?\\" in stressful work and other life situations.  If one judges a persons ego on their unwillingness to compromise a principal for the main purpose of staisfying others, Roark had the worlds largest ego.  If one judges ego on their need to be admired and praised, he had no ego whatsoever.    Compromising your principals will win you praise from others.  Praise feeds the ego.  Ego raises our expectations of what the world owes us.  Raised expectations lead to self entitlement.  Self entitlement leads to dissappointment.  Then, when the world   fails to deliver what your ego thinks it's owed, you have compromised your principals as well so there goes the ego!      Roark had absolutely no interest in being praised.  He wanted to create structures as he envisioned them and he wanted Dominique.  He got what he wanted and everyone else went home dissappointed.    This is almost a cartoonish way to live your life.  One would never find long term happiness in treating their family and friends this way but I frequently come across situations where the thought of Roark makes me consider whether I'm doing something to win praise and feed my own ego or doing it because it's the right thing to do.	2005-08-13

I'll be back for more of Saylor immediately.   <br /> <br />Short stories generally lack character development but the constant presence of Gordianus, Eco and Cicero obviate this problem.  While not heroic, this \\"gumsandle\\" is an engaging character and a very bright choice of protagonist by Saylor. <br /> <br />Placing a detective in a mysterious era lets us benefit from his inquisitive nature.  It's a natural way to uncover the details of Roman life.  A humble gentleman, Gordianus seems to live paycheck to paycheck and never lets the drama of his assignment interfere with collecting his pay.   <br /> <br />I read the stories out of sequence and was dissapointed when I realized there were none left for me to read.  In each story Saylor illustrates a main point that is easily retained.  The Consuls wife is a fun way of learning about the daily chronicles and how similar gossip columnists were to what we read today.  A Gladiator Dies Only Once may think about how we get our regular dose of blood, guts and horror from Hollywood.  Best of all to me was how Archimedes Tomb presented Greeks as the mathmeticians and Romans as the - well - romantics.  Archimedes Tomb also may be a great story to have a math challeneged child read as it teaches the reason the discovery of mathematic proofs matter to begin with, which is to solve problems like passing off silver based jewelry as solid gold and figuring out which cows belong to whom.	2005-08-04

I bought it as a rank beginner and couldnt make heads or tails of it because it assumes a certain level of knowledge.  If you're like me, you've eased into a core staple of patterns and progressions - this booklet helps me break out of that limited universe and expand. <br /> <br />There are some pure errors that are a big problem for an instructional book.  They can be found very early in the book and diminish it's value, since when I play a progression in the book that doesn't sound right I wonder if it's me or the book that's doing something wrong.  Example, the chord chart on the top of page 8 labels an F7 chord as F major. <br /> <br />For the $5.95 price however it's a good deal.

It has value for all levels and so it's something I love returning to as I gain experience.  There is nothing like a good intro or ending.  They are classified by style which makes them especially valuable.  Take example the old classic western \\"El Paso\\".  By applying Turners intro's and endings in D you can have your very own, personalized styling that will sound unique and appropriate to lovers of the song. <br /> <br />My favorites however are the turnarounds.

In other ways the story couldn't be more different.  From the safety of my living room I was able to feel the extreme discomfort experienced by Riley and his crew.  In some senses it makes Shackletons experience seem like a prolonged picnic in a winter wonderland.  Ace navigator, Captain Riley was not.  The crew of the \\"Commerce\\" blundered into a misfortune easily avoidable and  difficult to imagine.  Where as the Endurance crew had penguins aplenty and were awash in water, Rileys gang was forced to resort of the consumption of the foulest of substances in order to survive.  Worst of all was their lack of control in determining their own destiny, haven been bought and sold more often than the Brooklyn Bridge.  King did a great job presenting the story from beginning to end, with an epilogue that cleans up all of the missing bits of each participant in this epic drama. <br /> <br />You may want to keep in mind that the glossary of Arabic expressions appears toward the back of the book and it's a great help.  If you have a world atlas, you may want to dust it off and keep it nearby as you read along.	2005-05-09

It is number 14 on the modern library's editors choice for 20th century fiction, and I would rank it higher. <br /> <br />It was an amazing gift Graves had in occupying the first person as Claudius.  The life span of Claudius ranged from Cleopatra, Marc Anthony, Octavian, Augustus, Livia, Tiberius, Nero and the \\"colorful\\" Caligula (who engineered the death of his father Germanicus at the tender age of 5.) <br /> <br />Graves gives us deep, rich accounts of the back-stabbing senators and the development of the 'games' held at the coliseum as well as the circus maximus. <br /> <br />The characters come alive throughout the book and although surely liberties were taken in developing them, they are all real and presented as they were understood by Graves. <br /> <br />Graves consisdered himself a poet first and historian second.  I Claudius shows his third world class expertise which was story-telling.	2005-03-29

He was caught NOT in Maine, where Corson tells us they painstakingly spare large male lobsters, since they are oh so attractive to the opposite sex.  Furthermore, Corson points out that such large lobsters have very few natural predators.   The people who caught and sold him have destroyed what was probably one of the ace \\"stud-sters\\" in their own waters. <br /> <br />The fact that Bubba was taken at all is a timely reminder and perfect example of the sense of responsibility that Maine Lobsterfolk abide by.   <br /> <br />While I'm told that the whole New England region is now moving towards sparing large males, let's hope Bubba's sacrifice will catalyze the process. <br /> <br />There are some interesting explainations in the book, like the description of the growth and molting process, as well as the inverse relationship between cod and lobster populations. <br /> <br />His evidence of the pain lobsters endure while being boiled alive - and a couple of ways to mitigate it was also very interesting.	2005-03-12

The back cover has a strong endorsement by Dan Rather.  It wasn't until Crile lionized \\"Gunga Dan\\" early in the book that I realized the quid-pro-quo (Crile is a long time 60 minutes producer.) I say this in all due respect to Dan Rather.  I'm guessing that Crile's next book will be about the wacky adventures of DeLay and Abramoff (his only sources will be ... DeLay and Abramoff.)      The book is painful to read and Crile overuses too many phrases and expressions like \\"Gust loved nothing more than killing Russians\\".  It is very poorly written, painfully long moronic romanticism that mocks intelligence; of the reader and of the intelligence agents who are actually intelligent.  Crile's effort would have been entertaining if it were a 1000 word feature in Maxim magazine (with all due respect for Maxim.)     Writing style:  At first Mr. Crile only drops F-bombs when quoting Mr. Avrakotos.    After awhile Crile seems to become Avrakotos.  He has the articulatory skills of Rain Man.      Criles enthusiasm for, and romanticisation of both of the main characters and their resourcefulness in hijacking policy seems poorly placed in the context of the US-loathing terrorists they created.  It's not that much of a stretch to conclude that the only thing of substance ever created by Mr. Crile's heroes was the Taliban.    If you've read this far, I thank you for your indulgence and apologize for my psycho rantings.  I swear, I'm not usually like this.      The underlying story is interesting.

I never thought about yellow being such an obnoxious color before.  It's interesting to experience the world as seen by a child who's mind is wired differently from most.  The combination of the pragmatism of the hero and his unwitting solution to his family's problems make this story unusually simple on the outside and complex on the inside.  It was a pleasurable reading experience, not unlike \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\".   Perhaps unfairly I compare The Curious Incident to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

The vision of it's unique landscape and society, pre Soviet and pre Taliban opens a soft spot in the heart for Afghanistan.  Unlike many, Hosseini has enough respect for the reader that (with some exceptions) he leaves us to piece together the big picture for ourselves.  It is realistic in a very important sense - the sense that although redemption is always possible, sometimes it cannot be complete.  It is thought provoking and is bound to stay with you for some time after you're finished.  I'm told that this book was sold word of mouth which is inspiring in itself.	2005-01-16

Who knew the Chicago Worlds Fair was such a turning point in so many aspects of American life?  Who knew a cold-blooded serial killer could be so calculating?  Larson is a tremendous story teller who certainly does his research.  By organizing that research impeccably he ended up with a story that flows effortlessly from beginning to end.  It's as much a page turner as the best suspense novels and makes look forward to his next effort.	2005-01-15

Character development is excellent - The Behrani's are sympathetic characters who's lives are torn apart by two of the most birdbrained, pathetic creatures ever to show up on a printed page. <br /> <br />This is the flaw in the book.  I cannot believe that Lester and Kathy could possibly be so dim-witted.  If an underlying objective of this engaging novel is to mock California, Mr. Dubus was fairly effective.  So as not to give the story away, I will only say that the convergence of ineptness between a county, lawyer and protagonist with a deputy who's despicability is rivalled only by his lack of judgement is hard to believe.   <br /> <br />At the end of the book, the implausibility of the Californian characters stupidity kept screaming not just \\"fiction\\", but \\"parody\\".	2005-01-15

It's the type of classic americana the Pulitzer board loves. <br /> <br />Narrative and dialog are both cleverly written.

Who would think that a memoir of an unknown person would become so widely read?  The two first impressions one gets when considering this book are her quirky baby picture and the story of her first words.  Within five pages, she had developed her character so well that I truly cared about how this terrific young lady got along growing up.   <br /> <br />I also see an important lesson in it for anyone who feels different than the rest and is uncorfortable because of it - embrace those differences and don't try to change.   <br /> <br />My only complaint is that at times towards the end she has progressed so far as a person that she comes off a little bit snobby in her judgement of poetry and perhaps herself. <br /> <br />Don't let that dissuade you from reading this gem.  Ms. Kimmel has a soft sensitive sense of humor that resounds throughout.  I'm not sure whether or not she has had a baby of her own yet, but someday I hope she does so that she can entertain us all with another story from the heart.	2004-10-16

He is able to articulate complex thoughts and observations that we all unknowingly have into pithy, memorable statements.<br /><br />There is a beautiful softness to this story but you must divert your attention from Anna and Vronsky and rather look towards Kitty and Levin to see it.  These two characters are as heroic as Anna and Vronsky are miserable.  I didn't consider the ending to be the denouement to Anna's eventual fate.  I took it away as the point of the whole book.<br /><br />Levin is Tolstoy.	2004-10-11
