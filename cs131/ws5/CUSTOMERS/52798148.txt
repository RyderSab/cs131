Growing up in the 1970s, I couldn't get enough of \\"Peanuts.\\" I clearly identified with Charlie Brown, and I dreamed of having a dog like Snoopy.  Now, \\"The Complete Peanuts\\" puts the entire comic strip in perspective, treating it as a single narrative, almost like a graphic novel.<br /><br />Presented this way, \\"Peanuts\\" reveals the rapid evolution of its characters.  It's telling that the very first strip pictures two kids talking about Charlie Brown behind his back -- \\"How I hate him!\\"  From there on the mood is set.<br /><br />Those neolithic strips depict the Peanuts \\"gang\\" as far more childlike than we see them today -- they grew mentally and emotionally, if not physically.  It's also startling to see Snoopy behave as a normal dog... Woodstock, Joe Cool and the Sopwith Camel were years in the future.  Even Charlie Brown isn't the perennial loser yet -- he \\"gets his laughs\\" as he occasionally one-ups the others.<br /><br />By 1952, the core cast was largely complete:  Charlie Brown and Snoopy were among the originals, and Lucy, Linus and Schroeder are introduced as babies, one at a time.  The overall tone of the strip is established as well, an edgy sense of sarcasm, cynicism and irony that only increased in relevance as the feel-good 50s gave way to the political and social turmoil of later decades.<br /><br />Among the treats of \\"The Complete Peanuts\\" is a biography of Charles Schulz.  What surprised me the most about this is how little I knew about the man, who helped so much in putting my childhood in perspective.  \\"Peanuts\\" made him colossally rich, yet Schulz lived a life far more modest than celebrities who have a fraction of his wealth.  He was also painfully neurotic, a fact I found sad yet understandable.  Like his fans who read his strip religiously, Schulz saw \\"Peanuts\\" as a way of recapturing his childhood -- or at least making sense of the world around him.<br /><br />\\"Peanuts\\" is to the comics like the Beatles were to pop music.  It reshaped the genre so fundamentally that everything that came after owes a debt to it, and it's nearly impossible to remember what life was like before it.shaped the genre so fundamentally that everything that came after owes a debt to it, and it's nearly impossible to remember what life was like before it.	2004-09-08

This is important, as trends converge and combine in unexpected ways -- which is the central challenge of futurism.  &quot;Trendspotting&quot; also strikes a balance between optimism and a wariness of unanticipated consequences, which sets it apart from the Internet-will-change-everything enthusiasm of future guides of just a couple of years ago.<br />One thing &quot;Trendspotting&quot; is not is in-depth... which is not necessarily a bad thing.  The generalist approach makes it a great introductory text for beginning futurists.<br />The book, however, has two funamental weaknesses.  One is Laermer's very clear liberal bias.  In of itself, that isn't a problem, but a more politically balanced viewpoint would allow the book to be even more enlightening.  The second, more serious problem is not so much the fault of the book or author, but of time.  My edition is dated 2002, and it makes absolutely no reference to the most profound events of our time: 9/11 and the subsequent war on terror.  Books like this ought to be updated every year or so, as even the most subtle of current events can change the outlook of the future.	2004-07-09

Unlike Weird NJ, you won't find much about ghost stories, UFO sightings and urban myths in &quot;New Jersey Curiosities&quot;; instead, the focus is on real, specific locations that have down-to-earth yet interesting histories.  <br />One of the nice features of this book is that the curiosities are organized by region, so you can easily look up the oddities in your area.  Genovese also includes specific directions to aid in sightseeing.  One area of improvement would be to include more pictures, but other than that, it's a superb travel guide.	2003-12-29

Every state, I suppose, has its weirdness quotient, but NJ seems to revel in it like no other.  And &quot;Weird NJ&quot; is an excellent primer for learning about what this most misunderstood of states has to offer in terms of the offbeat.  A lot of this book's focus is on modern folklore and urban myth, ranging from the famed &quot;Jersey Devil&quot; to UFO and ghost sightings.  The book also focuses on strange places... many of them less &quot;weird&quot; than simply interesting (and often poignant).  <br />Much of the content comes from personal accounts written by fans of the magazine... which means that much of what you read in the book is in the realm of conjecture and tall tales.  But it's all entertaining nonetheless, and it provides insight to what confuses, amuses and frightens us.  <br />Hopefully, every state in the country has or will have a team as dedicated as the Weird NJ crew to document its oddities and legends.	2003-12-29

Some of the planes -- especially the pre-Wright Brothers attemps -- look absurd through 21st century eyes.  But in many instances, these aircraft actually solved important aeronautical problems, and helped the Wrights and other successful flyers.  And many of the post-Wright planes were \\"failures\\" for economic or political reasons rather than technical ones.  Cases in point were some of the cutting-edge WWII planes that saw limited production only because they were developed too late in the war.  Or, the thinking behind the planes was sound, but the builders were too far ahead of their time to have access to the technology to make their designs a reality.<br />If nothing else, \\"The Wrong Stuff\\" will give the reader a smile.  With lots of pictures, it's an easy book to read.  At most, the reader will come away with a renewed respect for successful pioneers such as the Wrights, and all those who take risks in designing and flying new aircraft.	2003-12-23

Hegel's thesis is that web services have the power to transform the fundamental ways in which business is conducted, removing many of the barriers and problems in information management, and allowing business relationships to form and dissolve more rapidly than ever before.  As a result, wholly new business models can emerge that allow businesses to respond to changes in customer preferences, compensate for new economic or political realities, and make continuous improvements in quality and value.<br />A highly readable work, just about the book's only weakness is that it is indeed based largely on conjecture, and the premise that today's web service protocols will form the foundation of long-term IT development.  Anyone even remotely familiar with IT knows that change can be sudden and dramatic.  However, Hagel presents a lot of sound and creative thinking that is especially helpful for an emerging technology such as web services.<br />&quot;Out Of The Box&quot; should be essential reading for any manager or executive whose job involves implementation of web services at any level.  By contrast, techies will find this book sorely lacking in specifics.  But that's okay, as there are a host of other books by O'Reilly and other technical publishers that do an excellent job of &quot;drilling down&quot; into the details of the technology.	2003-09-16

In reading David Weinberger's &quot;Small Pieces Loosely Joined&quot;, his thesis of how the Web works and impacts our lives, I couldn't help but recall Louis Armstrong's legendary response to the question &quot;What is jazz&quot;.  &quot;Man, if ya gotta ask,&quot; he supposedly replied, &quot;you'll never know.&quot;<br />&quot;Small Pieces&quot; tries to ask just that question:  What is the Web?  Not to say that Weinberger doesn't know (he does), but in trying to formulate an answer with &quot;Small Pieces&quot;, he offers few new insights.  There's nothing in this book that will hit the reader like a ton of bricks, especially if he or she has any degree of Web experience.  <br />Indeed, while well-written and informative, the bulk of the content is a rehash of earlier Internet thinkers like Clifford Stoll, Nicholas Negroponte, Eric Raymond, Howard Rhiengold and even Jeremy Rifkin.  Old-school netizens will be particularly disappointed, especially since the tone of the book comes disturbingly close to the technlogy-will-change-everything breathelessness of the dotcom days.<br />&quot;Small Pieces&quot;, however, has its merits -- particularly in Weinberger's writing style.  In that vein, &quot;Small Pieces&quot; makes a good beach book... and it's also good for those new to the Web (or at least those who are critically thinking about it for the first time).  But if you really want to learn what the Web's all about, get surfing and build your own website.

To the student of business history, the case studies presented in &quot;Why Smart Executives Fail&quot; reveal why hindsight is truly 20/20.  The mistakes of the CEOs cited in the book -- ranging from merely misreading the competition to outright villany -- appear almost frighteningly obvious.  In fact, the reader may well wonder where the &quot;smart executives&quot; were when these transgressions were committed.  <br />Indeed, anyone who has read more than a few business books will instantly recognize the lessons presented as both common sense and standard leadership thinking.  The writing style is entertaining enough, the reasoning is clear, and the case studies themselves have their own riveting pathos... the business world's answer to VH1's &quot;Behind the Music.&quot;  But otherwise, this book breaks little new ground.<br />The book's main thesis is that even smart executives make career-ending mistakes.  However, after reading the case studies, one must wonder at what point did these executives quit bringing their brains to the office...	2003-08-13

Immensely readable, the book chronicles the history of shopping and consumer behavior, examining *why* humans have liked to shop over the centuries.  Taking us as far back as the ancient Egyptians, Hine illustrates how politics, technology, transportation, geography and even religion have shaped our relationship with consumables and our methods of acquiring them.  Even those of us who like to shop regard it as a rather mundane experience most of the time, but Hine shows how complex and significant the act of shopping truly is.	2003-08-13

This book covers almost every aspect of life in the 1970's and '80's, from the most profound to the most trivial.  What makes this book a joy is its ability to remind you of the little things you've forgotten -- toys, fads, fashions, one-hit-wonder bands, TV shows, commercials -- and bring back a flood of memories.  <br />Though much of the writing is strongly tongue-in-cheek, it's not all cynical... which is quite refreshing.  Not everything about the '70's and '80's was horrible; indeed, in an age of terrorism and war, roller disco doesn't seem so bad.<br />This book was originally published in 1997.  If a newer edition is planned, adding some context would be especially helpful, now that the entire decade of the '90's has passed.

Much of \\"Execution\\" is plain old common sense; to move a business forward, everyone from the CEO downward needs to work to make things happen. <br />A refreshing departure from the fuzzy style of most leadership books, \\"Execution\\" is invaluable for up-and-coming business leaders of all stripes, though its focus is primarily senior management in very large organizations. Some readers will find that Bossidy and Charan spend a lot of time re-stating the obvious. For every \\"ah-ha!\\" moment this book presents, there are at least two \\"well, duh!\\" moments. But in light of many of the problems facing businesses today, the obvious bears repeating.<br />Others will find that \\"Execution\\" barely scratces the surface of a highly complex series of topics, and will want a greater diversity of business cases. Much time is spent fawning over Jack Welch at the expense of other, equally deserving business leaders. To that end, a sequel or a companion workbook would be helpful. But for getting managers thinking about their jobs in a new and beneficial light, \\"Execution\\" accomplishies its goal admirably. Much like broccoli!	2003-01-02

At best, it's been trivialized as a Dilbert-ism; at worst, it's a code word for layoffs.  But as &quot;The Re-engineering Handbook&quot; shows, re-engineering is a very real -- and very sensible -- tool for evaluating and enhancing workplace productivity and competitiveness.<br />The book provides a concise overview of business process re-engineering.  The exact process that the book uses (Rapid Re) is straightforward and manageable, especially when compared with other approaches such as Six Sigma.  And no, the book doesn't simply recommend layoffs (in fact, it emphasizes job reassignment and re-training over wholesale terminations).  The book is informative enough so that a workgroup with minimal re-engineering experience could at least get a healthy start into the process without first turning to a pricey consultant, though more background into specific techniques such as project management and process mapping are needed.<br />Written in the pre-Internet era, parts of the book seem dated.  But the core techniques remain sound.  &quot;The Re-engineering Handbook&quot; should be at the top of the reading list of anyone who expects to get involved with a re-engineering effort.	2002-10-23

Ron Popeil's infomercials are the stuff of pop culture legend; if you never got a chance to see them during the '60s, '70s or '80s, you surely have seen their parodies.  But what's the deal behind Popeil and his &quot;as seen on TV&quot; success?<br />The first part of this book is Popeil's inspiring autobiography.  Surviving a childhood filled with abuse and neglect, he discovered his gift as a salesman as a young man and went on to make a fortune.  At the dawn of the television age, he saw TV's potential as an unparalleled marketing tool and grew his marketing empire even further.  Ron Popeil's great contribution to retail, therefore, wasn't the myriad of gadgets he sold, but his style of selling on TV -- namely the infomercial.<br />The second part of the book is essentially a how-to guide for starting a business similar to Popeil's.  Even if you have no intention of starting a retail business, the details of how such a business works are fascinating.  Topics as arcane as patent protection, TV time buying, negotiating with retail stores for shelf space and financing (which forced Popeil into bankruptcy at one point) are all covered.	2002-10-10

Abridged and Updated	\\"Work 2.0\\" deserves attention simply because it's one of the first business books to reflect the post-dotcom, post-9/11 business environment. Beyond that, however, it reads largely like recycled Tom Peters... which isn't necessarily a bad thing. In today's business climate, themes like personal accountability and risk taking are more relevant than ever -- certainly more so than when Peters and his contemporaries first advocated them in the '80s. Jensen is right: the younger generation expects to be challenged in new and different ways, and successful managers will adapt their management styles accordingly. <br />Jensen even adopt's Peters' self-conscious, jaunty style of writing and heavy use of bullets and callouts. But if \\"Work 2.0\\" is a business book for the new millenium, one must wonder whether the new breed of workers is truly as fearless as Jensen argues. \\"My work, my way\\" in an \\"extreme\\" workplace is all very cool, but after the pink slip and several months of unemployment, it doesn't mean very much. And (harsh as it may sound) Work 2.0 also isn't very applicable to workers with lower levels of skill or education.<br />One gets the sense that \\"Work 2.0\\" was initially conceived and written at the height of the dotcom boom, then hastily retooled as the economy went south. Nevertheless, the book has some important things to say, especially to managers who might be supervising young knowledge workers for the first time. Plus, it's short and can be read in a couple of sittings.	2002-09-30

Rather than a how-to handbook for business success in the post-dotcom era, \\"Dot.bomb\\" analyzes the fall of the most notorious dotcoms, and postulates how they might have succeeded.  As the book illustrates, there's no single reason why the dotcom market imploded in early 2000; the market was born out of a flukish combination of events (affordable Internet access, the arrival of Windows 95, an exuberant stock market, etc.) and likewise crumbled through a similar combination of circumstances.  Bad business models, bad management, untested technology and a lack of investor confidence all played roles in the failure of one dotcom after another.<br />\\"Dot.bomb,\\" however, also examines the dotcom enterprises that succeeded, such as eBay, Priceline and our dear old Amazon.  What made these ventures an exception is a major thrust of the book -- and perhaps the most informative.  It also provides a light at the end of the proverbial tunnel for the reader weary of failure stories.<br />Since the latest examples in the edition I read were from early 2001, one hopes that a newer edition would bring the dotcom story up to date.  How the Internet industry has responded to the recession, corporate scandals and 9/11 are tales that an updated version of \\"Dot.bomb\\" ought to cover.	2002-09-04

Each lesson is easy to understand and relevant.  The pace of the entire book, moreover, takes you through the &quot;big picture&quot; aspect of UML right down to the fine details.<br />UML is typically thought of as a programming technology, but as this book illustrates, UML is a methodology that can be used throughout the enterprise.  In any instance where someone needs to communicate a process, UML is a powerful tool.  Much of it is based on self-evident analogies that most anyone familair with flowcharting can understand.  &quot;Teach Yourself UML...&quot; helps put the rest into context.<br />One fact to keep in mind with this book is that it is an *introductory* text.  Although it takes the reader quite far into the methodology, advanced practitioners shopping for UML books will likely want to keep looking.<br />The fact that UML is also so intiutive adds to this book's utility.  Many readers may find that this book -- along with possibly one or two more advanced books -- are all they need to understand and work with UML, saving themselves the time and expense of a classroom course.	2002-08-09

On the one hand, its message that failure is not an endgame is sorely needed in our current business climate.  The mentality over the past few years of winning at any cost has led us to the corporate debacles involving Enron, WorldCom, etc.  We also have a generation of young people who are experiencing a business downturn for the first time, and need all the help they can get in dealing with lost jobs, failed business ventures and other consequences.  <br />The book's message is simple and direct:  failure is not only an option, it is a part of life.  It's how we learn, a tool for making ourselves better at what we do.  The book itself spares us the typical executive what-made-me-a-success chest thumping and exhortations to &quot;think outside the box&quot; (which is rarely outside the box anyhow).  Instead, it sticks to common sense, and is brief enough to be read in one or two sittings.<br />But as I read this book, I wondered how relevant it really is to many people out there.  Are failures and mistakes all *that* tolerated?  In businesses that are looking for excuses to fire people, mistakes are seen not as learning experience but as opportunities to reduce payroll.  In that sense, placing the message of this book into the reality of today's workplace can be quite difficult.  Learning that Thomas Edison failed more than he succeeded is interesting, but cold comfort to someone struggling to pay the mortgage.<br />For managers who aren't afraid to act on its message, this book can be an excellent morale-builder for staff.  But for risk-adverse organizations, it might seem hypocritical to the point of absurdity.  It may also wake the reader up to his or her position in life... either confirming that they're on the right track or promoting a life-altering change.	2002-08-08

For instance, the township of Cherry Hill (across the river from Philadelphia) is named for the Cherry Hill Mall! Before the mall was built, the township was known as Delaware Township, but changed its name to capitalize on the success of the shopping center.  Also, in the 1960s, the South Jersey town of Pine Hill sported a ski resort (anyone familiar with South Jersey will know how absurd that is).<br />My only caveat has nothing to do with the book itself, but with the publication date. Having been published in 1998, it obviously doesn't refelct the most recent (2000) census data. Hopefully an updated edition will be forthcoming.<br />One would hope that a book like this exists for every state in the Union.	2002-08-08

Dunlap (or his ghostwriter) may state some good, no-nonsense business ideas here.  But given Dunlap's disastrous stint at the helm of Sunbeam, and more recently being the focus of shareholder lawsuits and SEC investigations, it's impossible for any informed, intelligent person to take this book seriously.  According to &quot;Chainsaw,&quot; John Byrne's expose of Dunlap and the Sunbeam fiasco, Dunlap violated virtually every tenet of &quot;Mean Business.&quot;  It's one thing to be a tough leader, but Dunlap crossed the line into sheer sadism and cruelty... all driven by personal greed.<br />There are plenty of better corporate role models out there, and plenty of better business books.  In fact, I can't imagine why &quot;Mean Business&quot; is still in print other than as an historical curiosity...	2002-08-08
US	52798148	RESYB36W2B3SN	0066619807	788204594	Chainsaw: The Notorious Career of Al Dunlap in the Era of Profit-at-Any-Price	Books	5	17	17	N	N	A difference between tough and cruel	If John Byrne's \\"Chainsaw\\" were a work of fiction, it would likely be considered unpublishable because its main character is so absurdely evil.  Unfortunately -- especially for those who had to endure his wrath -- the story of Al Dunlap is all too true.  Byrne's portrayal of Dunlap, who was hailed by Wall Street as a turaround genius before his leadership of Sunbeam ended in debacle, is that not of an admirable business leader, but of an hysterical, violent sociopath who, if his life had turned slightly differently, might well have ended up in prison, a mental hospital, or an early grave.  \\"Chainsaw\\" paints a portrait of a man who was abusive -- mentally, emotionally and even physically -- to nearly everybody in his life, from his business associates to his family to the few whom he considered friends.<br />\\"Chainsaw\\" chronicles the rise and fall of \\"Chainsaw Al\\" Dunlap so compellingly that even those who wouldn't think to read a business book will be hooked.  However, the book is in many ways fascinating the way that a car wreck is fascinating.  The reader will marvel at the amount and intensity of abuse Dunlap hurls at even his closest friends and allies, the coldness with which he treats his family (he abandoned his son at age 2 and couldn't be bothered to attend the funerals of either of his parents), and the near-perverted bounds of his ego.  In fact, as Sunbeam lurches toward collapse, his only apparent interest was in signing copies of his autobiography.<br />Defenders of Dunlap will say that he did the dirty work of downsizing and layoffs to save dying companies, sacrificing the needs of the few for the good of the many.  And true, the modern business world is filled with harsh realities and tough decision-making.  But Dunlap's approach to downsizing in \\"Chainsaw\\" teeters between indifference to those downsized and pure sadism.  At points in the book, he actually seems to enjoy cutting jobs and closing factories (though he usually had others do the dirty deeds).  As the author says, there is a business world between being tough and being cruel -- and Byrne leaves little doubt about where he places Dunlap.  Worse, Dunlap's moves at Sunbeam didn't seem to have been done with any level of intelligence, other than to get Dunlap a quick win so he could cash out fast.  The result was the near-total destruction of Sunbeam rather than long-term gains from short-term pain.<br />In \\"Chainsaw,\\" Byrne stresses that either through fear, greed or naivetee, others enabled Dunlap.  The way that each of these characters is drawn creates a fascinating if morbid portrait of a dysfunctional, cannibalistic organization revolving totally around Chainsaw Al.<br />Byrne is a terrific writer, and \\"Chainsaw\\" is a great read.  My only quibble is that, since Byrne and Dunlap apparently have had great animosity toward each other, Byrne often sacrifices any attempt at objectivity.  But perhaps objectivity isn't possible when chronicling such an extreme personality.<br />It's good to see \\"Chainsaw\\" returning to print in paperback.  Now, in the era of Enron and WorldCom, Sept. 11 and the War on Terror reminding us what real toughness is all about, and with the Wall Street euphoria of the '90s in the rear-view mirror, its perspective is needed now more than ever...	2002-08-05

With web services appearing to be the &quot;next big thing&quot; in web development, this book is a must-read for any developer looking to introduce him/herself to the technology, as well as for the technically-minded manager who may soon be responsible for implementing web services.  Clear writing and relevant examples make this an enjoyable as well as an informative read.	2002-04-19

But for the rest of us, Malcolm Gladwell's book is an entertaining and insightful read.  Gladwell and his book deserve credit for offering some outside-the-box thought about social phenomena ranging from drug abuse to early childhood education to the spread of fashion trends to school shootings.  An easy book, \\"The Tipping Point\\" is more appropriate for the reader curious about social trends than anyone looking to do in-depth research.  However, it's also useful to the businessperson looking for a different way to understand sales and marketing trends.	2002-03-25

In an increasingly complex world, a simple yet effective method of organization is crucial to one's success and sanity.  It doesn't matter what kind of job you have -- or whether you have a job at all -- for Davenport's methods can apply to anyone.<br />One weakness of the book is the rather minimal amount of time spent on e-mail, PDAs and other digital data.  At a time when many are cutting back on the use of paper, these media are becoming increasingly important, yet Davenport largely ignores them.  She is especially dismissive of PDAs -- something that's become an organizational lifesaver to me and many others -- and those looking for strategies for more effective use of digital media won't find much here.  Especially as this is such a recent book, such oversights are surprising; hopefully they will be addressed more thoroughly in future editions.	2002-01-16

Creative yet practical ways to motivate and retain staff are needed now more than ever before.  Between the sour economy that makes raises and bonuses tougher, the specter of layoffs that's making everyone nervous, the ability of top staff to bail on you at a moment's notice, and the trend toward making managers accountable for employee retention, managers can never let down their guard in this area.  Many of the ideas here are common sense, but can never be restated enough.  Others are low-cost and can be implemented with the leanest of budgets.  My one quibble with the book:  the suggestion to have executives spend a day with the staff is, IMHO, insulting to the rank and file and may even be counterproductive, as it comes off as more of a feel-good stunt benefitting the executives than a real motivator.	2001-07-13

I've bought copies of this book for all my systems staff.  A caveat, however:  &quot;Hacking Exposed&quot; is a highly technical book that's not for the novice or the technology-challenged.  If you want to give your boss something to read to bring him/her up to speed on information security, you're better off with something like &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; by Bruce Schneier.  But buy this book for yourself and your techie co-workers.	2001-06-29

Pat Croce gained national attention when his 76ers competed in the 2001 NBA Finals.  But to those living in the Philadelphia region, he's been an entertaining and inspirational fixture for years.  &quot;I Feel Great&quot; is a fun read precisely because it's not your average self-help or how-to-succeed-in-business book.  It's simply the tale of an extraordinary man whose experiences and insights you can apply to your own life.  And you don't have to be a basketball junkie or even a sports fan to enjoy the book.  Even if you don't agree with everything Pat has to say, &quot;I Feel Great&quot; will leave you thinking, smiling... and feeling great!	2001-06-29

Plus, it's an enjoyable read!  It has something to offer most everyone in the enterprise, from the CEO to the techies.<br />What this book is *not* is a technical manual; it will not teach you specific hacker exploits or how to configure a firewall.  In fact, there's little here that a seasoned security pro wouldn't already know.  But that's not the purpose of the book.  Its purpose is to educate the professional who is not a security expert yet who is impacted by attacks and vulnerabilities -- in other words, the rest of us.	2001-04-23

But Kawasaki distills some of the best such thinking into one little volume that's a great read... and far less annoying than the dime-a-dozen brag books of ego-tripping CEOs.  &quot;Rules&quot; is a tremendous motivator and inspiration (note to managers:  if you're looking for holiday gifts for your people, quit looking).  Especially fun is the list of &quot;bozoisity&quot; in the conclusion.  My only real quibble with the book is its title:  true revolutionaries, after all, don't follow rules...	2000-11-02

In addition, the book introduces good programming principles that can be applied to other languages.  Even the most novice web programmer can follow along, but it's also a good guide for experienced developers who might just be getting up to speed with PHP.	2000-11-02

With state-of-the-art changing so rapidly, it's hard for even a veteran IT  profesional to recall what were considered optimal solutions ten, five, or  even a couple of years ago. Many network engineers working today are too  young to remember what networks were like as recently as 1993. Also, the  case studies show how theory can be applied successfully in real-world  situations. Often, it's hard to visualize how a technical solution will  work in a particular environment; by including a variety of case studies,  solutions can be made apparent to readers from diverse backgrounds.	1999-11-05
