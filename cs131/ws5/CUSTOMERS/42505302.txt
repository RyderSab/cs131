Laura Principal and her old college friend Helen Cochrane love Wildfell cottage, their weekend retreat on the Norfolk coast.  But lately the upkeep has been a burden.  A friend recommends an art teacher, Monica Harcourt, to share the expenses- yet when they meet, Laura is uncomfortable with Monica, whose sunny personality is overshadowed by unexplained bouts of fearfulness.  Laura discovers too late why Monica was so afraid.  Someone was stalking her- someone who left her slashed and bludgeoned body in her Cambridge flat.  Flooded with shock, grief, and guilt, Laura feels compelled to investigate, despite protests from her business and personal partner Sonny Mendlowitz.  But as she narrows down her list of suspects, the killer is invading Wildfell, intent on turning Helen and Laura's sanctuary into a deathtrap. <br /> <br />The book has a lot of interesting characters and fun secondary plots.  The book seemed very \\"English\\" to me, with all of the characters being educated and well spoken, even the people in jail.  I do recommend this book because it was an intriguing read.  The only problem I found was that it was a tad slow and a bit descriptive of the settings for me.  But that could be because it is the first book of the series.	2005-08-11

We read this book on a recommendation from a friend and all came to the same conclusion- NEVER TAKE THE ADVICE OF THIS FRIEND AGAIN!<br /><br />The book was basically a long train of thought.  It takes us through the ideas and ramblings of a man living in Paris.  There is no actual plot and the characters are in and out of his ramblings with no logic.<br /><br />I have to say that there were certain themes to the book we picked up on.  There was a lot of sex, food and going to the bathroom.  The author/narrator was selfish and spent a lot of the book talking about how he got out of work, but still managed to eat and sleep with women.<br /><br />I did not enjoy this book at all and I'm surprised that it has such high reviews on Amazon, as I usually agree with most of the stars a book is given.  I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a read that will provide a well thought-out plot with in-depth characters and a strong message.	2005-06-24

Haunted by the memories of an August night nine years ago when a car crash robbed her of her family, artist Erica Stewart has focused her life on her thriving Houston boutique.  No one is more surprised than Erica when a new man walks into her life. <br /> <br />Texas born and bred, Hunter McCabe is a successful architect who is smitten the moment he meets Erica.  He's determined to pursue her- despite her efforts to keep him at a distance. <br /> <br />But someone is watching the dance of attraction between Hunter and Erica with growing alarm.  Someone who understands the dangerous connection between Hunter's powerful, politically connected family and the accident that shattered Erica's life.  Someone who understands that soon secrets will be revealed and lies will be exposed...  And that murder is the only guarantee of silence. <br /> <br />This book was a fun summer read.  I always love the mystery/romance genre.  The main characters were well developed and strong so I could root for them and both had enough history and complications to make their coming together interesting and difficult at the same time.  There were quite a few sub-plots going on at the same time and most of those were fun to follow as well, but there were a few I skimmed over.  It all fell convieniently into place at the end- and all was as it should be.  The book certainly wasn't thought provoking but there were a few unexpected twists in there that made it fun.  I would definitely recommend this for a \\"beach read.\\"	2005-06-12

Her mom left her and her father when she was a baby, then her father disappears, she sends the love of her life away after a misunderstanding, and then her good friend disappears.  She is coping the best she can, taking over the family business as hostess on a private island, leading dives, and giving vacationers a few weeks in paradise.  So, when the love of her life, Adam, shows up again just in time to rescue her from a kidnapping attempt, she wants answers! <br /> <br />I liked the book, it was a fun read.  The romance was good (if a little volatile) and the book was definitely filled with mystery.  The onlt problem I had was that there were just too many sub-plots going on at the same time.  I had a hard time focusing on the main characters because I was so busy trying to figure out what everyone else had to do with the book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in mystery/romance books and to anyone interested in diving.	2005-01-23

The first book was good- though the premise was a bit thin.  The characters had been through such hard times and found each other when they most needed to be healed finally.  It was a romantic story about the power of love to heal and to comfort.  The second story was my favorite because the characters complimented one another so nicely.  It really felt like they were completing the other.  It was lovely- full of misunderstanding but it doesn't drag it out for too long.  I recommend this book to all the romantics at heart.	2004-10-02

They had all gone through so much and really seem to complete each other.  It was a fun read but also an educational one.   <br /> <br />Francesca saw her life crumbling and went to find her runaway sister in Las Vegas.  She can hide her pain from everyone but in the process of looking for her sister finds a man she learns to trust with her heart. <br /> <br />Luke has problems of his own with an overly-emotional mother whose mental condition has no cure.

So, she finds herself involved with a group of powerful people who won't just let her leave. <br /> <br />When the 3 meet in Vegas it is a fateful encounter with romance and adventure and enough twists to keep you guessing.  I would definitely recommend this book!	2004-09-15

The heroines are smart and funny and know their own hearts, and the heroes are sexy, kind, and flawed.  I liked all of them but my favorite was the second, where in an accidental shooting, the heroine is left temporarily paralyzed.  It is left up to the cop who shot her to take care of her, and the story that unfolds is very sweet.  I am definitely going to keep reading this author!	2004-08-05

A crazed killer was threatening her.  He'd been in her house, he'd taken her daughter.  He wanted her to falsify important DNA evidence- or else.  Stephanie could comply with his demands...or she could do what she'd vowed never to do again.  She could trust a man.  She knew Detective Reid Peters was hell-bent on keeping her and her child safe.  But the stolen kisses between them were a dangerous distraction.  And dare she hope that the jaded cop could offer her and her lonely little girl what they needed the most?   <br /> <br />I very much enjoyed this book.  It was sweet and funny without going over the top.  The characters were smart and they all had their problems but deep down inside they want to change.  They want to love and be loved.  It really is a cute story.  Readers have to suspend belief but the book was delightful if not thought provoking.	2004-07-31

So when his wealthy grandfather asked him to accompany her on her road trip &quot;for protection&quot;, he couldn't resist.  But Henry also couldn't resist Jess's honesty, her beauty and her ability to smile in the face of disaster- and her two cranky but adorable fatherless children- no matter where they parked the station wagon!<br />This book was sweet and I read it all in one day.  The ending especially was fun, and the cute dialogue made me smile.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it was hard to tell why exactly they switched from being annoyed with each other to falling in love.  But I guess that's just how it is sometimes.	2004-07-12

I liked how the main characters were middle aged and still vibrant.  There was a tragic part of the whole story that they had let so much time go by before finding each other again, but there was also a sweetness to the story that would not have been there without the heartbreak.  The nieces and nephews were delightful and I am hoping that there will be more books about them in the future.  We know that Destiny had something to do with their marriages, so perhaps this will become the first book in a series.	2004-06-28

I know a little about the Amish people but not a whole lot.  This book was actually educational.  I didn't know if I would like it because it seemed far fetched that there would be romance between an English woman and an Amish man, but it just goes to show that you can't help who you fall for.  There were lots of characters who could have done it and the mystery was hard to figure out.  It seemed like some of the events were pretty random and thrown in there for confusion but all in all well done without being over the top.  The romance was sweet, and I really liked the kids.  I am not a &quot;kids&quot; kind of person so it was refreshing when I actually cared about what happened to them.  All in all, definitely one I would recommend.	2004-06-27

Both the main characters had a past but they were able to get past them a little too quickly for my liking.  The female was weak and looking for a man to save the day, which is just what the man wanted to do.  It was too sickly sweet for my taste.  There were a few twists and turns and I liked the Irish setting, but for the most part I ended up skimming.	2004-06-25

When a very pregnant Liz answers her doorbell one evening she opens her door to her husband who has been incarcerated for the past 7 months after confessing to a murder he did not commit.  In a case of misunderstanding he thought Liz had done it so confessed to keep her out of jail.  Now they are both looking for the killer before his new trial starts and before the killer realizes that they are onto him/her.<br />This was a book that you have to read without thinking too deeply.  The characters are shallow and hard to like.  Besides Alex (the husband) I didn't really care about them one way or the other.  In any case, if you like romance and mystery this could be interesting.  Just make sure you don't care if it is based in reality or not.	2004-06-17

There is the same selfish but likeable woman character and the mysterious but heroic man she is in love with all centered around her desperation to return to her southern home after the Civil War.  Yet, the main characters did not inspire me to feel sorry for them because they didn't have the same kind of hardship that the other characters had to face.  So, although I enjoyed the book and thought the subplots were interesting and well-written I cannot give this book more than 3 stars.	2004-06-15

So she resigns, and in comes Paul Cabrera, from Miami to take her place.  Unfortunately, the night of her going away party she finds out that her new job isn't going to pan out after all.  That same night she breaks her leg and meets her replacement.  She has already rented out her place to Cabrera so she decides to stay with her mom while she is recuperating.

There seem to be quite a few books out there with cults in them recently.  I, personally, find the whole subject very creepy, which is why it is perfect in a mystery/romance.  When Julie escapes from a cult with the baby of a best friend she has to reinvent her life.  She becomes a famous newscaster and 16 years later finds herself involved in a murder with ties to her past.  She immediately is confronted by her nemisis (and new partner) who ends up helping her (because he is, of course, the love interest).  All in all, a delightful read, if a little predicatable.  In any case, I am looking forward to the sequel and recommend it.	2004-04-28

I liked how everything was not as perfect as it first seemed to be with the family, and that there were secrets.  Still, through the tragedy that the family had to go through, they bonded and became closer than ever.  The book didn't try to solve all the problems in a couple of weeks, instead they went for months and still it wasn't completely resolved.  It made it seem like life would continue with ups and downs and all that we really know is today.  I liked that the ending was sweet but exactly a happy-ever-after type.  I couldn't wait to finish reading it and I look forward to the next Sherryl Woods book!	2004-04-25

I liked this book because it provides everything that I was looking for.  I love romance, and this one was excellent.  The characters were likeable but they also had a few flaws.  They fell in love, but it was in a way that made me laugh and sigh at the same time.  The women in the book are all strong and independent and I like that type much better than the ones that are weak and needing a man to feel complete.  The mystery was fun.  It did not capture my interest like the romance but that is because my interests do not lie in history or relics.  In any case, I am definitely looking forward to the next book in the series of this family.	2004-04-23

They can't help the attraction but they are determined not to let anything deeper than that develop.  But they can't help themselves.  I enjoyed the missions and the intelligence of the agency and the characters.  I definitely recommend this book and am eagerly awaiting the sequel.	2004-04-18

I thought that the characters were well developed and witty.  They were perfect for each other and there were plenty of suspects for the whodunnit that made it difficult to figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; was.  Still, I did not like the fact that the heroine of the book had been married and engaged twice before.  It made her seem a little shallow and I didn't think it was necessary.  Plus, we didn't hear very much about either of their pasts and I would have liked to know more about them.  But, all in all, fun and fast.  I would recommend it.	2004-04-15

She couldn't exactly call him a stranger- not when he'd saved her life, not when they'd bared their souls to one another and made love with reckless abandon during what they thought were the last days of their lives.  But could she trust the devastating Colby Agency operative to protect her and the precious life she carried when he was duty bound to her enemy?  Or would his loyalties change when he found out he was about to become a father?<br />These are easily answered questions.  I mean, this is a romance/adventure book after all.  The plot was a little far-out and the dialogue predictable, but it was sweet and I liked the sexual tension the characters had.	2004-04-05

The first half of the book was great, but the second seemed rushed and did not go into enough depth for me.  Then, when it looked like the book was going to end, it didn't.  It seemed like the author threw in one extra twist that was unnecessary and did not flow with the book, and then tried to explain it.  Even the characters said it made no sense!

Ones that have gone through a traumatic event, such as this one, tends to be even more so.  This story of a girl searching for her lost brother, who disappeared after the death of her other brother, is one ful of drama and feeling.  It is choppy at times, and it takes a lot of patience to be able to understand the motivations of the characters, but it is truly wonderful and I definitely recommend it!	2003-12-23

It is a great source of the history of California in the 19th to 20th century and it has a lot of detail about migrants.  I enjoyed the stories of the families and how they interacted with one another.  I think the book flows nicely but there were a few loose ends that I think could have been wrapped up more thoroughly.	2003-11-24

And with good reason.  For she was the only witness to a murder.  A murder her mind refused to recall.  A murder assistant D.A. John Cohen needed her to remember so that she could testify and put an end to the threats, the danger.  Until then, John felt duty bound to protect her.  Just until the murderer was found, he told himself.  After all, she was his key witness.  But once the passion exploded between them, the rugged D.A. came to realize that his key witness had come to mean so much more...<br />This book had well developed characters and a lot of mystery/romance.  They did not rush anything except for the ending which seemed a little unbelievable.  Fortunately, I do not read these books for realism!	2003-11-24

Definitely a good read, but fast.  The romance was sweet and the mystery decent, but I had it figured out long before it was over.<br />There were some real dilemmas in the book, but of course it wrapped up happily.  Almost too happily.  I would have liked an epilogue but I would recommend it.  Make sure to read the first one!	2003-11-20

Juliana (the butler's daughter) is entrusted with Cort, the heir to Collingwood, when the first heir is kidnapped.  She and the baby are returning to the parents of the child when the home explodes and kills the parents, and puts her dad in a coma.  They immediately call &quot;The Guardian&quot; who is supposed to protect them from harm in case of an emergency.  The Guardian marries her for her own protection, and the protection of Cort.  The Guardian is Hunter Sinclair, godfather of Cort, and trusted friend of the dead couple.  While Juliana and Hunter rush to find the killer, they also find themselves falling in love.<br />I finished the book in a day.  It is not long, but it is a great story, full of intrigue and love.  The characters are interesting and have a past that makes their distrust of one another very reasonable.  There will be more in the series and I am looking forward to it!	2003-11-11

The back of the book says:<BR>Driving cattle across mountainous Colorado terrain to gain an inheritance she didn't even want was not Samantha Howard's idea of a good time.  Especially since someone was dead set agains her inheriting her grandfather's ranch.  A menacing presence overshadowed the drive, and the murderous threats against her became all too real...<br />Then Roark Hawke, the lean-hipped, sexy rancher and sometimes private investigator hired to protect her, ambled into her life.  He was everything Samantha hated in a man- a cowboy with ranching in his blood.  Neither one expected the irresistible passion that arose between them , even as the danger mounted.  But when seperated by a killer's last, desperate act, could Roark save the woman he had come to love?<br />This book was interesting, and the characters were fun to read about, but it seemed a little vague and there was a lot that was left unexplained.  I am not sure what it was about the 2 main people that made them fall in love with eachother and I wish the backstory had been a little more complete.  In any case, I recommend this book but only if you are buying it used.  I wouldn't pay full price :)	2003-10-18

Finding their baby was her priority now, but the familiar heat of Jared's arms was proving a dangerous distraction...<BR>One touch of Rachel's lips and Lieutenant Jared Dillard knew he'd do anything to have her back in his bed.  Bringing their baby home was the first step.  Stopping a murderer was the second.  And if risking his life was the only way, he would prove the power of a father's love...<br />This book was sweet, but there seemed to be some back story that I was missing.  I enjoyed watching these 2 characters find threir way back to each other and I definitely recommend it to those who like a romance/adventure.  There wasn't a lot of mystery and that is what disappointed me the most.	2003-10-06

Ty North is the only man she has ever loved and he left her at the altar 9 months earlier.  Now he is back and they try to figure out whodunnit while also trying to figure out where they stand with one another.<br />I definitely enjoyed this book- the romance was great and the action was thick.

The back of the book says:<BR>Arson investigator Gideon Taylor had his hands full with three suspicious fires and no leads.  Complicating matters were his unresolved feelings for former colleague Meghan Wright- the one woman he'd never got out of his system.  She'd become the target of a stalker, whose proximity to Gideon's assignment was no coincidence.  But as Gideon and Meghan joined forces to uncover the secrets scorched to cinders, it was clear a five-alarm inferno was about to ignite between them.  Could they reveal who was responsible for what appeared to be an elaborate plan before the sizzling embers of their relationship were permanently extinguished...?<br />I enjoyed this book because it had characters that were flawed and manged to find love in spite of it.  The woman was strong and courageous and the man was exactly what she needed.  There were some moments that seemed a bit over the top and the whodunnit was a bit of a let down.  But the chemistry and romance between the 2 main characters more than made up for it.	2003-08-24

Jolie was coming undone and under investigation by the disarmingly handsome Simon Ruhl.  But would he bed her or bok her?<BR>Undercover Colby agent Simon Ruhl had his sights set on Jolie for more than one reason.  She was suspected in a money laundering  scheme and she was clearly being set up.  Simon was duty bound to protect Jolie from an unknown threat while surreptitiously proving her innocence- all before he went totally insane with desire for her.<br />I finished this book in one night.  It is not complicated or long.  The whodunnit was fairly simple but I loved the struggle for the 2 main characters.  They were obviously meant for each other but the case was getting in the way and I was curious to see how they would overcome that.  A definite 4 stars.	2003-08-18

The characters feel real.  There are a lot of people to keep track of and sometimes it goes back and forth in time but there is a useful family tree in the front of the book that I kept referring to.  <br />I got a feel for Costa Rica past and present and I enjoyed the stories of the different characters.

It was interesting- plenty of blood and characters to make it interesting.  I enjoyed the romace between Tully and Gwen (what little of it there was) but WHERE was the romance between Nick and Maggie?  There were only a couple of mentions of him at all and that was one of the best parts of her first couple of books.  <br />I am not into religion and find the whole idea of cults only somewhat interesting.

I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie, thinking that it would be one I &quot;had to just get through.&quot;  I don't like horses and non-fiction books are usually a bore for me.  This book had me going from chapter to chapter with hardly a break in between!  It was excellent.  Factual but with interesting emotions playing into it.  I could clearly see the character of the horse and the people were almost as enticing.  I learned a lot about the world of horse racing, which was surprisingly interesting, and the life of a jockey, which was absolutely horrifying.

She meets up with the man she once had a girlhood crush on- the financer of her brother's car, and his best friend.

Someone wanted to remove Sarah from her child's life, yet Royce was there, foiling kidnapping attempts and murderous plots...all the while disarming her with his sultry midnight kisses.  But could Royce unlock the secrets of Sarah's heart before it was too late?<br />I liked this book because there was so much going on.  Was it just a coincidence that Royce, a world-renowned tracker of kidnapped children, showed up at the same time Sarah's son was almost kidnapped?  Why was he there and who wanted her son?  These two people have a lot of baggage and it was a joy to watch them overcome their own fears, as well as a killer, to come together.	2003-08-01

I am a big fan of the mystery / romance genre, but more often than not I am disappointed by the lack of either believable romance or psychological horror.  I like to be scared (and, yes, I am somewhat morbid) and this book did not dissapoint me in any way.  The heroes were suitably manly without being overbearing, the women were smart and brave.  Unlike some books where I felt the victims took unnecessary risks, and therefore &quot;deserved what they got&quot; these victims were smart about their choices and were caught anyway.  <br />I am not going to go into detail about what this book was about because so many people have done that before me, but if you like a good creepy tale laced with romance you will thoroughly enjoy this book (first in the Shadow series).	2003-07-28

Something evil stalked Blackthorn...and as the townsfolk cried for blood, Marcus vowed to watch over Aurelia in the darkness...<br />I have to say that I was not all that impressed with this book.  It had romance and mystery but it seemed clouded with sub plots and secondary characters that were never resolved.  The mystery was solved, but there were a lot of questions that remain unanswered.  I have read the second book and the same goes there.  I recommend this book only if you are a dedicated fan of the author and are insistent on reading all of her books.	2003-07-26

As a woman- the bonding of these characters is a wonder to behold.  They break the barriers of race and age to find that love has no color.  The white girl learns early on that there are many things that the world doesn't appreciate about black people- black women in particular.  She points out all the wonderful qualities that go unnoticed- even today.  I loved hearing about the volatile 60's from her perspective- so young and objective.  I don't have the words to explain how interesting this book was.  There was mystery, romance, tragedy, and love.  READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!	2003-07-11

The narrator was so life- like and the family so realistic.  I saw bits and pieces of my own family in this one and it made me remember the good times.  <br />I was waiting for the father to do something horrible, I was waiting for there to be abuse or something that broke the family apart, but throughout the entire book the family loved eachother and stuck by one another.  By no means were they perfect, but even thought they had their own personalities you never doubted their love or respect for their family.  <br />I am not one to like &quot;miracles&quot; in books but these seemed to fit- and I found myself questioning these &quot;miracles&quot; as the narrator assumed I would.  All in all a wonderful book and I recommend it without reservation!	2003-07-11

The book is about a woman named Rebecca who went to Blackthorn to oversee an arqueological expedition.  There is someone trying to stop the expedition, and there are strange occurrences on the property.  When Rebecca realizes that she needs help she calls in handsome (and single) sherriff Dru.  Together they work to find out who is out to stop them and why.<br />The book was decent, and the romance was sweet, but there was no buildup or wrinkle in the relationship.  It was a little too straightforward.  The mystery was better than the romance but it left some unanswered questions- perhaps for the next book in the series?  I recommend this book if you are looking for romance/mystery and like books in a series.	2003-07-06

This book had 2 great plots- the main plot was about Luke marrying Cat for his inheritance and Cat marrying Luke because she fell in love with him at first sight.  She had to hide it from him because Luke was not interested in love but everyone else guessed it almost from the beginning.  Luke was protective about Cat and lusted after her but he started to develop feelings that scared him.  Of course there is a twist- Luke was engaged to Cat's step-sister before she ran away with her high school sweetheart.  But when she comes back, and is interested in Luke, the drama begins.<br />The second plot (which became more interesting than the main plot) was about Cat's best friend (Jack) and Luke's best friend (Keith).  Jack is gay and Keith starts to question his own sexuality when he finds himself drawn to him.<br />Both romances were sweet and romantic.  There was a lot of humor in the book and of course real-life is a lot more complicated but that is not why we read these books!	2003-07-03

I expected a flimsy romance story but what I got was a tense book of mixed emotions, crossed signals, and mysterious pasts.  I really enjoyed the romance part of this book.  I read most of it in one night and only when my eyes started to cross could I bear to put it down.  It was a fast read but there were secrets that the pair kept from eachother that I really wanted to find out the details of.  It wasn't a book that made me think a lot, but it made me sigh because of the intense feelings that the couple could finally admit to.  I highly recommend if you are a romantic at heart and like to see a happy ending for 2 people that have had it rough.	2003-07-03

This one is about a woman, Daria, whose twin sister and brother-in-law are killed by food that she gave them.  As the prime suspect in the case she turns to Ryker, the computer expert in an elite unit called The Shey Group.  He goes undercover as her lover and as more strange things happen the two fall for eachother.<br />The book was decent- it had plenty of romance but the feelings seemed forced to me.  Also, Daria didn't seem nearly upset enough that her best friend and twin sister died.  It is one thing to be brave, but this chick never even cries.  I would recommend this book to people who are interested in romance/adventure and can look past some unlikely characters.	2003-07-01

I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has had an event that made a &quot;before and after&quot; period in their life.  It made me reflect on my own family history and how I have come to accept that people react to the same event in very different ways.  The narrator of this book describes quite clearly how families can be changed by a single event- one that occurs all too frequently- but that single event makes all the difference.  <br />The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it was too much &quot;before&quot; and I thought the book went on too long in the beginning.  Also, I had a hard time with the authors wandering thoughts.  The narrator would start off with a comment that would make me think &quot;Aha!  Now we're getting to it!&quot;  Then they would go off in acompletely different direction, only to come back to it briefly at the end of the chapter.  Very annoying!  Still, if I skimmed the parts that didn't interest me, about 1/2 way through the book I was hooked!	2003-07-01

It is about a woman who was kidnapped and, when she is rescued, needs protection because he managed to escape.  Blade, the bartender with a past, volunteers for the job.  His friend, the detective in charge of the case, takes him up on the offer.  <br />It wasn't really hard to figure out why Blade wanted to help, but it put an interesting twist on the scenario.  The book has romance but it wasn't forced and it was nice to see how much they cared about eachother in the end.  Not a book that will make you think, but a nice escape for a few hours.	2003-07-01

It is about a woman who invents a computer program that someone is trying to kill her to get.  She and her baby daughter are left to die in a snow storm in the Rockies.  It is up to her ex-husband, a Marine turned Search and Rescue, to find her.  He does and they try and avoid getting killed while discovering the identity of the would-be killer.  With the help of Logan, the leader of the Shay Team (an elite crime fighting unit), they work to bring down the bad guys.  Meanwhile, they re-discover their love for eachother and wonder if it is too late to give their love a second chance.<br />I liked the book because it had action and a very sweet romance.  However, I felt like there were a lot of sub plots that should have been developed more thoroughly.  This book is recommended if you want a nice, easy read with a nice romance and some suspense to go with it.	2003-06-30

She is known for her work on battered womens cases and someone who has access to her office and an in-depth knowledge of surveylence is coming after her.  She promises her loving aunt that she will get in touch with her ex-husband, and  the head of a private security agency, for help.  Between the stalker and the love the two still have for eachother, the book really sizzles.<br />I enjoyed the book because the two have some unresolved issues that they have to work through and despite their attraction, they care enough about eachother to know that getting more intimately involved would be a heartbreak waiting to happen.  Therefore, the suspense is a great build up.  The action is continuous and the ending is perfect.  Not a book to make you think but a great summer read.	2003-06-30

The implant is supposed to make her believe her undercover story so that the enemy cannot get the real story out of her  should she be captured.  Fortunately there is a &quot;back door&quot; to the implant and Kat has made sure that only Vince can access that door- because he was her one true love.  Vince can't forget or forgive himself for betraying her trust 4 years ago and the opportunity to be with her again is a bittersweet reminder.<BR>The book has plenty of action and romance but I don't like that for most of the book Kat and Vince have a relationship that is based on false memories.	2003-06-25

The plot was good- and there was an interesting twist.  The romance was nice- it didn't go too fast and it didn't feel forced.  The romance was only a small part of the book and some of the actions and words of the characters implied the gwowing attraction without going into detail.  The only part that I found a little disappointing was that the lead detective didn't do enough investigating.  It seemed like the leads just fell into her lap and she didn't have to work for them.  Otherwise I really enjoyed the book!	2003-06-24

The book was about a family of women and the problems that they  have to overcome- individually and as a family.  The problem I had with this book that there was too much whining and not enough good things.  I know that doesn't make sense but the characters were downers.  They all had great things going for them but they didn't communicate enough with each other and in the end very little was resolved.  The only character who I liked completely was Brent, a family friend who might (or might not) have a crush on the 22 year old.  To be honest, it seemed like a set up for a sequel.	2003-06-22

This book has 3 great romances is it.  <BR>The first book is about Travis Haynes, the sherriff of Glenwood.  He helps a single mom in distress and despite his past, falls in love with her and her daughter.<br />The second book is about Kyle Haynes, deputy of Glenwood.  He is the youngest Haynes brother and when his high school crush (with her 3 kids) buys the house near him he sees his second chance.<br />The third book is about the long-lost half sister of the Haynes clan.  She goes to Glenwood with a hired husband, thinking that her mother is dying.  When she gets there she is surprised that the entire Haynes clan is there to welcome her and her mother is far from ill.  She starts to fall for the hired husband who she thinks is a criminal but is really an undercover cop.<br />The things I liked about these books were that every character has some issues and they all fight to overcome them.  Despite their troubled childhood they come together as a family and their love for each other shines through.  I know that there are other books in the series and I think they belong in between these books.  I'm not sure of the order they go in but I think there are probably one or two in between the second and third books in this 3 in 1 Hometown Heartbreakers.	2003-06-20

It re-introduces characters from the first book and this time deals with the romances of previous secondary characters.  It also gives us updates on other characters that we knew and loved in the other book.  <br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  Although it has 3 books in 1, it is more like a shifting of focus than a brand new book every time because the characters run through the entire book.  The writing is excellent, the characters diverse and very interesting.  I recommend this book for anyone looking for an escape into a wonderful world of romance!	2003-06-19

She saves a man's life and 6 years later needs his skills as a bodyguard to protect her from an insane preacher.  I found it to be a touching story but a little too \\"otherworldly\\" for my tastes.  <BR>The second book deals with a woman who moved to the Blackwood ranch in New Mexico to recover from a brutal rape.  4 years later she is still there and meets J.T., the owner of the ranch who she feels a deep connection to.  When her rapist escapes prison she finds herself in need of a bodyguard and J.T. (a former Agent turned bodyguard) takes the job.  This book was my favorite- both characters were well developed and their internal demons formed some complicated issues.<BR>The third book deals with a woman who is in need of a husband and bodyguard.  Her uncle died, leaving her the family business but only if she marries and has a child within a year.  But someone in her family has decided she should sell and has tried to kill her.  Simon Roarke takes her hand in matrimony and becomes her husband and bodyguard.  He needs the million dollars she offered to take care of his insane ex-wife.  They both find their attraction growing into something more but will they be able to battle their fears and a killer?

There was too much of the author trying to be funny and I don't read these books to get humor out of them.  It ended up belittling the characters and promoting stereotypes.  In any case, the book had little mystery and suspense and I am hoping that the next book involving these characters is better.	2003-06-13

Meanwhile, the head of security can't get her out of his head and realizes that he doesn't want her to run.  He wants to help her- even if it means he can't get justice for his dead sister.<br />The book is often unrealistic and the characters fall in love in a matter of days.  Still, it is a fun read.  There is plenty of action and the other characters in the club are interesting and mysterious.

So, he is out for revenge, and she doesn't know why.  They fall for each other, of course, and the ending is incredibly romantic.<br />The second book is about a surrogate mom and the father who finds her.  He wants custody of the child and under British law the only way to ensure that would be to marry her.  Of course she needs a husband to claim her inheritance.  Despite the obstacles and deceptions they fall in love.<br />The third book is about a woman who was blackmailed into living with a married man and the man who wants her for himself.  He marries her so he can have her and she can claim her inheritance.  Again, there are deceptions and misconceptions.  Through it all love prevails.<br />All three books are warm and the fact that all the men are foreign (Italian, Venezuelan, Greek) makes it all the sexier.  Truly, a great read.	2003-06-02

US	42505302	ROGLO9J7EIJK8	0373227000	3371011	Confessions of the Heart	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Disturbing and Intriguing	I don't usually rate a book 5 stars unless it really touches me on a deeper level.  This book wasn't one that required me to think but it was quite different than the usual summer light romance/action books that I am used to reading.<br />The book is about a young woman who recieves a heart transplant and goes to find the family of the woman who gave it to her.  Meanwhile, she starts dreaming about the dead woman's husband and the dead woman's husband seems to have hated his late wife.  <br />The whole thing was twisted and bizarre and I really enjoyed reading it.  Of course there was romance and mystery but the author really made it interesting.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a mystery/romance slightly off the beaten path.	2003-06-01

Alex is being targeted by assassins in the USA and he hires private investigator Taylor to track down the assassins.<br />All in all a good read.  The Prince was the usual suave, handsome, brave man who found it intriguing that Taylor didn't trip all over herself to please him.<BR>Taylor has a lot of baggage from her father and ex-husband.  I found her to be the more interesting of the two characters.  They were an interesting couple and I enjoyed reading the drama and romance that they were involved in.<br />The book is well-written for a &quot;typical romance.&quot;  I didn't learn  anything nor did it make me think.  That is exactly why I read it.	2003-05-31

The woman in the book is a college professor and very pregnant.  She falls for her \\"student\\" who is really an undercover cop.  Still, she doesn't know and the moral dilema is interesting.  The cop finds her extremely sexy and attractive which is a switch from the normal slim, leggy, perfect females in most of these romance books.  In any case, I recommend it.  It is a quick read and not educational in the least- but fun!	2003-05-27

The heroine is a strong woman and the man with a past is written fairly well.  The book doesn't require you to think.  You might learn a little about firefighting and all in all is a decent, quick summer read.  It shouldn't take you too long and the story is interesting enough to keep you intrigued to the end.	2003-05-05

But twelve years later he returned, and she learned he'd been undercover for the FBI, investigating her family.  Payne's kisses still thrilled her, but did Eden dare trust her heart or let him in on her- their- big secret?<BR>Payne Magnuson was considered a renegade agent- and a wanted man who'd been framed for murder.  The stakes couldn't get any higher...until Eden told him he was a father!  Now nothing would keep him from the woman he'd never stopped loving and the child he had yet to meet.  But would fate and a vegeful murderer allow this joyful reunion?<BR> <BR>I didn't think I'd like it so much.  I judged the book by it's cover (I know, I know) and it seemed like a thoughtless 2 bit romance where the characters were brainless but beautiful and that I'd read through it in a matter of hours.<BR>The truth is, I did read it in a matter of hours, the characters were beautiful (and fairly stereotypical), but they were far from brainless.  The plot was developed nicely with some complex emotions running through them.  <BR>If I could, I would give the book a 3.5.	2003-03-10

In these 3 in 1 books you usually hear about the first couple a few times in the next book, about how welll they are doing and how happy they are.  As a rare, and realistic, change the couples here have problems and we hear about them in the next books.<BR>I liked the writing style, and I liked the individual personalities of the women in the books.  The men were a little harder for me to understand and there were questions that went unanswered about them and their pasts.  It makes me think that there will be follow ups and I will look forward to reading them.	2003-02-09

I hav e read all three books in the trilogy and I love how all the characters are different and yet have a bond that is unbreakable.  This is, of course, a romance book, and I suspend my reality in order to enjoy it.  The amazing pull between the characters is sizzling, and Nora Roberts knows how to play it up to the fullest.  I loved the heartbreak in the past and the way that these characters heal with the possibility of a future between them.  This was my favorite book in the series, and as always, Nora Roberts delivers exactly what we want before we even know what that is.	2003-02-09

These 3 stories are about 3 different ladies and the men they meet who sweep them off their feet.  I loved each one for the same reason...the stories were completely romantic, the characters had been hurt in the past and had to overcome the obstacle of their fear to be together.  There was always a short breakup before they realized that they couldn't live without each other.  The stories completely satisfied the romantic in me and the only problem was that they didn't last longer!	2003-01-05

It is about the one who doesn't have it and the guilt and responsibility he feels.  I am a twin as well and I had to read the book slowly so as not to be overwhelmed.  I LOVED THIS BOOK!  It came recommended to me and when I saw how long it was I was not looking forward to it- now I wish it never ended.  Please read the book.  You will find out things you never knew you never knew.	2002-12-24
US	42505302	R15AMUQPDCY1HB	1551669471	257966809	Trouble Becomes Her	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A funny intelligent read	Well, this is my second Laura Van Wormer read and I have not been disappointed.  There is a funny heroine who has some deifinite issues with men, a lesbian work-a-holic boss, and murder.  How can you lose?  Instead of the usual who-dunnit the plot involves the mob.  Really, it is quite good.  I'll read the next one, not just because it will be an interesting plot (and not that easy to figure out) but also because I want to see where life leads this woman.	2002-12-21

This book was wonderful.  The characters are well thought out and the men are strong and brooding.  Everything is timed perfectly.  The stories are different but the pattern is the same.  Woman (with babies) has problem, meets man, fall in love, have issues, make up.  It is standard but the writing is great.  I don't usually go for the stories that have babies in them but in this case it was done so that there isn't a lot of backstory.  Anyway, I highly recommend this book and I am usually very picky about the romances I read.	2002-11-16

It wasn't difficult to figure out &quot;whodunnit&quot; but the cast of characters kept my interest.  The romance was fairly typical but the people weren't.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a break from their problems for a few hours.	2002-10-21
US	42505302	RYM9DTCYRGOKO	1551669102	940011803	Blood Roses	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An intelligent honest book	I don't know much about the politics in Ireland, I usually read romance, mysteries, or Oprah Book Club books.  After reading Blood Roses I feel I have a deeper understanding of the religious battles that took place, and continue to take place, in Ireland.  With the political strife also came a lovely romance between the heroine and an English police officer.  I think I liked the book most because the heroine was a strong, honest, powerful mother who finds love with a man who has little problem aknowledging and admitting his feelings.   All in all a terrific book.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because at times it went into a little too much detail with some of the minor issues.	2002-10-14

A friend of mine was curious about the Jewish religion and started asking me basic questions about what Jews believe but I didn't know how to answer.  I picked up this book, thinking I would skim it and find her answers.  Instead, I read it cover to cover and enjoyed avery minute of it.  It was written in a way that was not overwhelming and it answered every question about what Jews believe from the symbolic meaning of the Star of David to Jews' beliefs on homosexuality.  There was a short section on the history and each section talked about the beliefs of all different kinds of Jews.  All in all a great read!  I DEFINITELY recommend it!	2002-09-19

My first Dallas Schulze book was Loving Jessie which I thought was excellent.  I bought this one and was a little disappointed by it.  The male romatic lead, Luke, was not developed as a character to the extent that I would have liked.  We never heard the words \\"I love you\\" come from their mouths.  It was implied but I always like the closure at the end of books when I can hear the \\"I love you\\" spoken.  Anyway, it was a good book and I do recommend it but there were a few flaws.	2002-09-16

This character has always fascinated me and in this book she was brought to life.  She was given a history and we can see why she was how she was.  It also brought to mind the question \\"What is evil?\\"  We were led to believe she was evil by viewing the movie from the perspective of Dorothy.  Here we can see the perspective of the Witch.  We meet characters from the movie, and delve into their lives as well.  We explore the politics of OZ and their religious beliefs.  The author holds true to events from the movie and adds to them as well.  Truly, I LOVED this book and I highly recommend it for anyone who has an interest in OZ.  I was sad to see it end.	2002-08-06

Only Jenna was returned a few days later.  15 years later Jenna returns to her childhood home hoping to uncover clues about what happened to her sister.  Also returning home after a 10 year absence is Mace, the man Jenna has been in love with her entire life.  He is also the old boyfriend of her sister.  <br />Together they begin to unravel the truth, and find out all kinds of secrets about the town and their families along the way.<br />I enjoyed the telling of the story.  It was suspensful and romantic.  The characters had human flaws and were people I could relate to.  I'm already looking for another book by Harper to read.	2002-07-13

The combination mystery/romance was very well written.  My only complaint was the ending left readers hanging a bit.  Jackson explained in a note to the readers that she would wrap up loose ends in her next book but that means we have to wait :(<BR>Bottom line: Dark and entertaining, some interesting paranormal stuff, a good summertime read.	2002-06-18

Entertaining but not intellectually stimulating.  The characters in the small town were interesting and I enjoyed following their quirky romance.  The plot was lacking in intensity and there wasn't much of a mystery.  Bottom line:  It kept me interested enough for me to try another of her books but not interested enough to pay full price.	2002-06-17
