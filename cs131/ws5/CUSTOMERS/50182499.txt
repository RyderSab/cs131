What has finally come forth as \\"Engineering the World\\" will surely grace the public spaces of all TI facilities, providing visitors waiting to see TI engineers or interview for jobs an excellent overview of the company's considerable innovations and achievements during its first 75 years (e.g., the transistor radio and the integrated circuit).  But the book is not a definitive examination of the interpersonal dynamics among the extremely bright, ambitious, and hardworking men involved.  A chronicle such as Gay Talese's saga of the evolution of the New York Times (\\"The Kingdom and the Power,\\" London, Calder & Boyars, 1971) was not the model for this endeavor.  And at this point, with TI's founders and many principal participants gone, such a work is probably not possible.  Since, as far as I know, none of those folks was inclined to publish a memoir elaborating on his part in the company's creation and evolution, I assume that journals or diaries may not be available.<br /><br />For more detailed TI nuts and bolts, you might enjoy the story of Cecil Green, a founder of TI and its parent company, Geophysical Service Inc (\\"Cecil and Ida Green: philanthropists extraordinary,\\" by Robert Shrock, MIT Press, c1989), or the humorous memoir of 37 years at TI by engineer/inventor Ed Millis (\\"TI, the Transistor, and Me, \\" Dallas, Ed Millis Books, 2000). Mr. Millis was also a member of the research committee for \\"Engineering the World.\\"	2005-10-12

Clever use is made of various red herrings to lead Rhyme and his investigators, and the reader, away from what's really going on.  Is it unusual that the nominal star of the series, Lincoln Rhyme, takes a back seat to the villain of the thing and his target, the child Geneva?  Perhaps this is necessary, since Rhyme is confined to his apartment and can't figure in the various action scenes.  One of the technical problems facing the author of a series about a sedentary protagonist.  But it encourages the author to create new and interesting characters to keep his franchise going.	2005-10-06

It is not about how nuclear bombs are designed or how they work.  Primarily, it once more illustrates how U.S. commie-phobia affected everyone during the Cold War. I suppose Edward Teller comes off as a bit of a villain for his single-minded promotion of hydrogen bombs, which were viewed by many of his contemporaries, and by even more folks today, as a weapon whose widespread and long-lived destructive effects, or \\"collateral\\" damage, would be unacceptable.	2005-09-09

This book is a fantasy featuring the pretend exploits of Bruce Campbell during the making of a Mike Nichols film - exploits not unlike those in the B pictures Mr. Campbell has been so effective in.  I suppose the author would rather be making a picture than writing a book, but either way, he seems to be having a good time.

In this story the reader is required to simply accept that the superhuman strength and agility of the superman costume at the center of everything is achievable.  I don't accept that, and the author does nothing to change my mind.<br /><br />What the author presents us is a gadget flitting about overturning humvees and other heavy objects, supposedly using hydraulic power.  Hydraulic devices certainly can lift heavy objects, but the pumps, tubing, and cylinders required are way larger than anything fitting inside something as compact as the gadget described in this novel.  And if you want your hydraulic device to be capable of exerting great power and at the same time responding like a gazelle, its complexity would make it even more cumbersome.<br /><br />If you can overlook this quibble, then the story might entertain you for a couple of hours, although the characters and writing are not all that well developed.  It is a case of plot trumping everything else, which is a frequent fault of this sort of technological novelizing.	2005-07-16

But since I can't quite figure out what the plot is, I'll forego that comment.  However, it does seem that the story is plot-driven, since its strange protagonists are likely at any time to abandon whatever course they are following and behave in ways inconsistent with who they seem to be.  So I assume they must be motivated by some force outside themselves, such as the exigencies of the plot.  For example, I'm always skeptical of scientific intellects who suddenly abandon their labs and classrooms to run around constructing and planting car bombs and otherwise committing homicide.<br /><br />There are a great many people involved in whatever is going on, and the author cuts back and forth among them so rapidly that it's hard to keep track of what any one of them is doing.  These cuts are abated from time to time when one of the characters takes a recess to explain some scientific or statistical theory.  I can almost understand these, but of course, I've no idea how accurate they are.<br /><br />At this writing I'm about 65 percent through the book, and not likely to continue much beyond the point where a pigeon manages to ground a helicopter by flying into its tail rotor.<br /><br />At least one reviewer notes that the plot has to do with the idea that no event is unpredictable, although most are not predicted because we do not adequately comprehend enough of the infinitude of factors leading up to those events.  An intriguing book might be one dealing with how to actually do that.	2005-06-28

This is not Rick Steves does Vietnam.<br /><br />Nelson DeMille's novels hew to a formula, but it's how he fleshes it out that makes his work superior.  DeMille's total command of his characters and material means that even though his books run several hundred pages, there are no wasted words or wheel-spinning.  Every line must be read, because each is likely to contain a nugget of humor or insight.  DeMille sets a daunting standard of detail and intelligence for aspiring adventure novelists - alas, one that many current practitioners of that art form don't approach.	2005-06-05

It starts with the story of how its author set about deciding what is the \\"best\\" tool developed during the millennium just ended.  His object was to write an essay on the topic for the New York Times.  On his wife's suggestion he settled on the screwdriver and then scoured museums and libraries for its provenance.  The book, however, is not primarily about screwdrivers, but about this research and ultimately about the screw itself, which after all gave rise to the screwdriver, and about some of the machinery such helical devices enable.  It is the author's feeling that the screw represented a leap of inspiration rather than a logical development based on previous devices.  It may be that using screws to fasten objects together was a genius move, but in fact shafts with helical threads were earlier used in various machines where considerable pressure needed to be generated, such as oil and wine presses and their offspring.	2005-06-01

But that's apparently what Bukowski did.  I'm curious how many more poems he marked for posthumous release, but I'm not aware if John Martin has said.  At any rate, the current batch is topnotch Bukowski and essential to any collection of his work.<br /><br />In the past, one of my pleasures on finding a new Bukowski volume was to note the author photo, which changed from book to book.  Now I get the impression that the official photo will be that of of  the more avuncular-looking, white-haired Buk wearing his old-man windbreaker and gazing benignly at the camera.	2005-05-05

This is a tolerable facsimile of the great consulting detective in action, but the cold London rain lashing the windows of 221B Baker Street and the clatter of the solitary hansom in Oxford  Street late at night are considerably missing from Caleb Carr's attempt at a Sherlock Holmes tale.  The need to fill a book may be what caused a yarn that the great detective's creator would have dispatched in 20 to 25 pages to be frustratingly long on chitchat and short on action - e.g., a train ride from London to Edinburgh takes 54 pages, although momentarily enlivened by a foiled bomb attack.  Caleb Carr has the Doyle style down but produces only a semblance of Sherlock Holmes.  Missing are the amazing turns of deduction that Doyle's fans awaited eagerly in the latest issues of The Strand magazine.  However, if you've read and re-read the original canon till it holds no more delights, this is not a bad read.	2005-05-02

And as usual, Burke manages to convey a sense of the physical setting of his story.  This makes for a nice contrast between pristine natural beauty and the evil men do in its midst.  At the end of the book, we are left pondering the true state of Wyatt Dixon's psyche.  I recommend this novel to all, and especially Burke fans.	2005-04-10

Since his first appearance (and disappearance and reappearance and disappearance, . . .) in the novel Jumper, Davy Rice has married, and, miraculously, when the chips are down it turns out that Davy's wife Millie is able to teleport too.  What are the odds of his marrying someone like that, I wonder.  Anyway, the scene-changes are fast and furious as Millie flits about finding Davy and wresting him from the clutches of a powerful agency that has drugged him and implanted a nasty nerve-stimulator that makes him run at both ends when he strays beyond the agency's bounds.  You can imagine his problem -- if he jumps out of their clutches, he's debilitated by a lot of very unpleasant digestive eruptions.  And it turns out the implant is booby-trapped to explode if you try to remove it.<br /><br />Mr. Gould is a competent writer, but he gives this novel neither the wit nor philosophical richness to explore broadly what teleportation might imply.  Indeed, Davy, whose only interesting feature is his rare talent, has, up to his abduction, apparently been content to use his ability merely to haul stuff hither and yon at the behest of the National Security Agency.  It's only when his freedom is seriously threatened that he begins to explore the full scope and nature of his gift.	2005-03-26

Dispatched by a Saudi entity to rain destruction on the inauguration is a villain who, interestingly, admits that he isn't the most brilliant operative around.  He makes up for this by being quite ruthless.  But you have to feel for the guy somewhat in that his preparation for the task at hand has involved his undergoing a protracted course of plastic surgeries to totally alter his facial and sexual appearance.  This includes having inflatable boobs installed under his skin.  As the story progresses, it becomes pretty apparent that he could have accomplished any identity confusion his assignment calls for by donning wigs and other detachable prostheses. But the plot is heavily involved with a sneaky plastic-surgery clinic that would have been unnecessary had our bad guy relied solely on makeup and fake hair.<br /><br />This novel could be improved by pruning the dialogue scenes about 25 percent.  I rather quickly began to feel I was hearing every word that our protagonists have to say about every perhaps mundane point, when in many instances, all we need to know is the gist of their ruminations.	2005-02-12

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Engrossing work by a literary master	Willie Chandran, whom we met in \\"Half a Life\\" has, after 18 years, left his wife's farm in Africa and is now living with his married sister in Berlin.  Willie still has not figured out what to do with his life, although he is now in his 40s.  As we have learned, Willie comes from a family that has no marketable skills and subsists on the charity of others.  Willie's sister convinces him that journeying to India to aid a certain band of revolutionaries is the thing for him to do.  However, he seems to find his way to the wrong band of revolutionaries.  But since there seems little to choose among these groups, he sticks it out and manages to survive in the forests  and in prison for seven years.  Then it's back to Berlin and rather shortly to London, where he moves in with an old friend and eventually acquires, through the friend's influence, a low-level position with an architectural magazine.  At the end of the novel, Willie has about managed to talk himself out of pursuing his newfound interest in becoming an architect, owing to his age, which is now 52.<br /><br />Naipaul's genius is in making Willie and his cast of friends and relatives complex enough that their situations elicit our sympathy and hold our interest.  Unexpectedly, the strongest chapters in the book may be the last ones, which present the friend's condemnation of the deterioration of English life owing to the disappearance of the serving classes and to the sort of irresponsible council-estate existence perpetuated by the social-welfare state.	2005-02-03

I see two ways to make this idea interesting.  First is to detail just how such a creature can be made, using today's technology and maybe a little fudging, thus appealing to the computer geeks among us.  Next choice would be to contrive a really clever set of exploits and episodes based on the differences between real and computer-based creatures.<br /><br />Mr. Berger chooses to elide the technical details and leap right into the world of the fully realized automaton.  But if I'm going to grant him a pass on the technical end, I expect him to make up for it by providing a whale of a good yarn on the other end.  But alas that is not what happens, and the story leaps from point to point with not much wit nor irony aside from maybe the general message that people are too easily fooled by surface appearances.	2005-01-11

The memoir thus opens many more windows than would the ramblings of a less gifted protagonist.<br /><br />The  writing is more than equal to the images it is called on to create, and the influence of Mr. Cohan's father is delineated touchingly and understandably as it evolves from early days in New York and Hollywood up to the day of the elder Mr. Cohan's death.	2004-09-24

In Little Scarlet, Easy Rawlins goes out into Los Angeles in the immediate aftermath of the Watts riots to find a white man the police believe killed a young black woman who sheltered him from marauders who attacked him during the riots.  The police fear that investigating the crime themselves would draw attention to the crime and that its white-on-black nature would spark further rioting.<br />Through the story pass the many and varied personalities familiar from earlier Easy Rawlins novels.

The premise that a high-tech company can transform one of its low-level slackers into enough of a whiz-kid to fool another high-tech firm into hiring him may seem a bit unlikely.  If you assume that our slacker hero, Adam Cassidy, is really a natural con artist unaware of these talents until forced by happenstance to find his true calling, then it seems more plausible.  The fact that the phony resum&eacute; he is provided paints him as a major contributor to one of his former employer's key programs makes it understandable that a rival firm would take him aboard.<br />Once inside his new employer's place, the machinations and subterfuges he employs to gather the information he's after make for exciting times, indeed.

It is disquieting to realize, though, that important issues may be decided on the basis of votes guided by these lies.<br />The effectiveness of the book is indicated by the number of semiliterate and inarticulate yawps and fulminations it has attracted from what are, I assume, conservatives of some stripe.

I mean, the actual WWII is over and the Soviet Union is no more, so who is a worthy adversary for U.S. military might?  The maneuvering of the high-tech subs involved in this cat-and-mouse procedural is entertaining enough but a bit repetitious.  We certainly learn a lot about subsurface mountains along the way.

Quiller is one of those secret agents who arrive on the scene capable of executing incredible physical feats in the face of overwhelming odds.  Quiller is easily able to murder anyone with his bare hands, which he does repeatedly, and at the same time to be suave and clever enough to charm his way into anyone's good graces.  In this yarn, after various car chases and other didos in Moscow, Quiller uses false papers to get himself incarcerated in Russia's most inescapable Siberian prison camp, where he seeks out a prisoner he has never seen and whose name he turns out not to know, gets the prison blacksmith to hammer out some rock-climbing gear, and then lifts himself and the other man to freedom up the side of a granite face during a nighttime blizzard, thereby eluding the pack of ravening wolves that roam the camp's perimeter.  Unfortunately, the book ends without a suitable denouement, owing, apparently, to the death of its author, Elleston Trevor.

This is a big but fast-reading book that should appeal to those who enjoy behind-the-scenes Hollywood.  Joe Eszterhas writes well, although you may wonder why he has chosen to detail how self-centered, egotistical, and greedy he is.  His \\"filmography,\\" which I find on the internet, strongly suggests that he's basically a hack screenwriter whose claim to fame centers on making the most lucrative deals for himself regardless of who he has to bulldoze to do it.  His sense of self seems invested in being the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood, and he appears most threatened when he suspects that someone else may get more for a screenplay deal than he does.  He may think that admitting his deficiencies will expunge his responsibility for them.  Or more likely, he's just writing for money again.<br />There's little or nothing in the book to indicate how Mr. Eszterhas became the \\"Hollywood Animal\\" that he is.  He elides almost all mention of his work as a journalist and leaps from adolescence in Cleveland to his position atop the money pile in Hollywood.  He seems genetically programmed to fit right in with our impression that Hollywood is peopled by self-seeking, backbiting, greedy, schlock merchants for whom making the big money deal is the first order of the day.  Making movies seems to be only a byproduct of all this deal-making, and it's a tribute to the technicians that they turn out as well as they do.	2004-05-18

He has the statistics to back up his positions and notes that the hypocrisy of the Bush administration is simply its way of trying to disguise its position at the feet of the wealthy who finance Republican campaigns.

Le Carr&eacute; is among the best at creating characters who get through life with no particular identity of their own, often owing to early estrangements of one sort or another.  In this case, the victim is Teddy Mundy, son of a Pakistani army officer and an Irish domestic, an intelligent youngster who sees himself as having no particular ethnicity or country and no clear vocation.  He falls in with revolutionary elements in Berlin and thereafter finds it easy and quite agreeable to be recruited by the British secret services and to operate under the identities that facilitate his work as a double agent in the battles of the cold war.  It is a story in which no one is who he seems to be and therefore just the territory to which le Carr&eacute; is a most entertaining tour guide.	2004-05-08

So I expected this, the first of Gash's books to come to hand, to be equally clever and to the point.  Not so.  I found the characters too numerous and not particularly well developed, save for Lovejoy himself.  And since much of the yarn takes place on a cruise ship, there are no locations to speak of.  The frequent lapses into technical talk about how to identify various items were pretty tedious, although I expect antiques hunters would enjoy them.  And anyway, if Lovejoy is a \\"divvy\\" who spots the real item by instinct, why has he bothered to learn so much technical stuff anyway, and why hasn't he put his gift of divination to more lucrative use?  Instead, he seems to get by as a not-too-successful forger/thief/con artist who's primary goal is sleeping with women.  He seems not the sort of scholar who's going to master a wealth of arcane minutiae.	2004-04-27

The protagonist, an elderly man whose career consists of creating highly sophisticated firearms for assassins, is currently living in a small Italian village among the mountains.  His warm relationships with the locals and his highly developed appreciation for his surroundings are detailed so well that the reader may experience sensory overload reading descriptions of the wine, the food, the rain, the mountain scenery, the attractions of prostitutes, etc.  Reconciling this appreciation of the simple pleasures of life with the cold-bloodedness of a murderer is the trick in appreciating this man.  As it turns out, it is his awareness of his surroundings that has enabled our man to slip from one part of the world to another many times, eluding the shadowy people whom he spots trying to tail him and, he assumes, do him in.  The ending of the story may be a mild surprise, but there is no socko conclusion.	2004-04-21

He believes language comes out of people by instinct rather than totally as a learned skill.  In this regard, he finds infants to be \\"geniuses\\" of language in that, for example, they can produce grammatically correct expressions they haven't heard before.  To call them geniuses seems to me misusing the term somewhat.  If a genius is someone who far exceeds the norm for his age group in some respect, then babies are not geniuses, since almost all seem to have the instinct for language.  This minor quibble over terminology is not to dispute that human infants pick up language with great facility, however.<br />The discussion of how the brain works in the area of language is followed by a discussion of prescriptivist grammar, which Pinker criticizes for being a collection of outmoded and inappropriate rules that in many ways hamper more than help verbal expression. This is like shooting fish in a barrel, of course, since any collection of rules and regulations will eventually be rife with inconsistencies and unnecessary strictures.  Taking potshots at grammar rules is like picking on the U.S. tax code or our collection of laws in general.  As do many critics of grammar rules, Pinker occasionally employs ridiculous examples that a competent writer or editor would very likely avoid or eliminate entirely with a more efficient phrase or sentence.<br />When I encounter antiprescriptivists, I always wonder what they would substitute for grammar rules, if anything.  They often refer to a \\"natural\\" grammar, which is apparently the instinctive process that Pinker finds. I wonder how far into the world of complex ideas this instinctive grammar can carry us and whether my version of it would jibe well enough with that of other folks to permit effective communication.  Perhaps the antiprescriptivists will settle for updating existing texts with what they consider more suitable guidelines and pruning them of outmoded or senseless rules.<br />If you are interested in the origins of grammar and language, Pinker's book is a good place to start learning about them.  It may relieve you of some of the grammar guilt you've carried since grade-school days.t effective communication.

Indeed, the language is more abstract and deals more with things in general and less directly with the East Hollywood life with which Bukowski is so firmly identified.  I find the work enjoyable but less so than the later work because it reminds me of other, more academic poets and doesn't reinforce my concept of the author's uniqueness as based on the later work, which I read first.  Maybe I shouldn't have read the later stuff first, although had I read the first stuff first, I might not have bothered to read the later stuff.  On its own merits, this is a good book, and Bukowski fans need to read it if only to round out their view of its author's development.<br />The book is said to contain poems from 1946 to 1966, yet the end note states that Bukowski started writing poetry  at age 35, which would be 1955.  Exactly why the time span goes back to 1946 is thus not clear to me.	2004-02-17

Not all of Bukowski's enormous output of poetry is of equally high quality, but I've yet to read a Bukowski short story that wasn't well crafted.  Whatever your attitude toward his subject matter and apparent philosophy of life, you must respect his lean and evocative prose style.  Anyone trying to write should acquire his skill at conveying everything needed with the minimum of words.  This is a trait shared by most good writing, and it can be acquired through practice.  The first step is to know exactly what it is you want to tell.<br />If good writing can be learned, then why aren't we all renowned authors?

There isn't really a bad or wasted line in here.  This opinion is based on my knowledge of Bukowski derived from having read maybe 90 percent of his books.  If you can have only one volume of Bukowski poetry, this should be it, in good part because it includes musings from his East Hollywood period and the affluent San Pedro days.  In this regard, You may notice that Bukowski almost never mentions money or personal finances in his earlier work, but in San Pedro, mortgages, tax accountants, and the price of automobiles enter his view.	2004-02-14

Deaver's books are like movies waiting to happen in that his characters aren't all that well developed, but his plots are ingenious.  Live actors give the characters dimensions the novelist hasn't provided, and the picture is more satisfying than the book.<br />This books rocks along pretty well for awhile, but finally the incompetence of the police and the improbable good luck of the villain become a bit much.  Deaver's basic cast of characters is its usual self, though, with Amelia Sachs still suffering arthritic knees and racing about Manhattan in her Camaro and Lincoln Rhyme still snapping at everyone.  The author has assembled a good deal of research into sleight of hand and illusions, and some of it is interesting enough.  The premise of the book is that by misdirecting your pursuers' attention and wearing makeup, one can escape from any situation.  I mean, this villain goes around killing people while wearing two layers of clothing (e.g., a suit under a bellhop's uniform) and carrying all sorts of makeup, with which he manages to transform himself on the run in ways that defy detection by supposedly sharp-eyed cops who are actually trying to apprehend him.  And when they do nab him, they're totally out of their depth.  To wit:  Our heavy is put in cuffs and taken to the Tombs, where he retrieves a lock pick from  under a band-aid on his thigh and opens the cuffs.  All this while being transported by police.  He then grabs a revolver from a cop (do the cops carry guns in the cells?) and fires it, simultaneously triggering an explosive squib, which he has previously concealed under his hair.  This propels a baggie full of bone and stuff onto a nearby wall so that it appears he's blown out his own brains, an illusion heightened by fake blood he manages to apply to the other side of his head.  So not only has he picked a lock unnoticed, but he's wearing an explosive device taped to the side of his head, with a couple of electrical connections hanging off it, no doubt.  Didn't they search this guy at all?  Anyway, a squib of this sort covered with a bag of bone fragments, would probably, to quote Dirty Harry, blow your head clean off, since the overlying material would direct the explosion into your skull.  And during the excitement he also manages to put drops in his eyes that make him look deader.  The outcome of this improbable scene, by the way, is that the cops simply leave him lying in the cell, without checking closely for wounds or life signs, until an accomplice claiming to be from the medical examiner's office carts him away.oubt.

Jack Reacher is the prototype guy whose military career taught him that it's okay to kill people and hasn't been able to get over it.  In real life, we try to throw such psychos in jail.  Reacher's saving grace is that he kills only bad guys.  Lee Child writes engrossing novels about Reacher, but they're a guilty pleasure because of their premise that it's okay to use a homicidal vigilante to straighten out your problems or misjudgments.  This idea is not unique to Lee Child's books, but Reacher seems singularly unaffected by slaughter.  In the hands of a less skilled writer, Reacher's amorality would just be a joke.  In the current book, Reacher demonstrates his versatility by dispatching a houseful of thugs, using firearms, rocks, neck holds, and chisels.  Despite the fatalities, I'm sure that I'll pick up the next Reacher novel, however.	2003-07-19

I bought the 5th edition of this series when I acquired an iBook a couple of years ago.  I hoped to learn more about deploying the basic capabilities of my OS 9.1 software than the little help screens provide.  In the two years  I've had the book, I've found almost nothing I needed to know to solve a real problem.  The book seems to try to deal with several versions of Mac software and is actually a grab bag of &quot;look at this cute trick&quot; features, which may not even be achievable by my particular version of the OS.  It may be that I bought the wrong book, but it seemed the most likely one on the shelf.<br />A case in point occurred when I recently began to suspect that the MACRO function could be combined with an IF function in a spreadsheet to do some format or color changes on the fly.  However, this book offers precious little about macros, let alone other spreadsheet functions or the technique for combining them, if indeed that is possible, as it is in other spreadsheeting software.  Perhaps this sort of information is not considered a &quot;secret&quot; and thus not appropriate for this book.  Unhappily, I know of no other resource for it, so it remains a secret to me.	2003-06-18

The emphasis is on in-home maintenance of the elderly, specifically parents, although one chapter is devoted to selecting and monitoring a nursing home.  The book gives the impression of being able to prepare the reader for any situation and to help him cope with whatever comes up.<br />The point is made throughout that caregivers need to avail themselves of the many resources that exist to help them with information and hands-on help.  The idea that taking on the responsibility for an ailing or aging parent means that the caregiving offspring do everything by themselves, while simultaneously continuing to meet the demands of their own lives and families, is shown to be destructive to the caregiver as well as in many instances impractical.<br />One element in successful eldercare is keeping up with exactly what is happening with the elderly person and how to cope with the problems it may present.  Thorough documentation of everything is stressed, such as physical conditions and medications, prescriptions, diet, etc.  Forms are presented to simplify this, along with checklists of things to do in various situations.<br />A liberal inclusion of anecdotes from caregivers around the U.S. reveals the many difficulties and rewards experienced by those engaged in looking after their elders.

It reads like a master's thesis but is clear and easily understood.  The 46 pages of bibliography provide lots of academic studies to go after if you like statistics.<br />Of most interest to me are the chapters on life review, whereby persons try to discern the pattern and value of their lives; spirituality;  and emotional health.  Also, the role of medication in the elderly, exercise and nutrition, falling and fear of falling, and geriatric rehabilitation held new information for me.<br />An overall sense I get from this book is that even though being old is largely a sedentary occupation, it should be less so, and that in order for one to keep from becoming prematurely disabled, some physical training is in order as soon as possible.  If this idea were acted upon more in retirement communities, and everywhere, for that matter, residents might postpone their loss of physical ability, especially ability to stand and walk.  For many, physical conditioning could be as ambitious as tai-chi and weight training or swimming.  This would strengthen them and preserve their body control, as well as providing the other physical and psychological benefits of exercise.  Retirement communities could keep their residents mobile longer and perhaps require fewer wheelchairs if their apartment-dwellers spent an hour or so a day doing something more physical than watching TV.	2003-04-08

Its seventeen chapters touch on most of the concerns encountered by residents, visitors, family members, and staff of nursing homes.  Addresses of various agencies dealing with elderly care are listed.  The author is a freelance writer whose husband was in a nursing home.<br />Most of the content won't be new to anyone with experience of nursing homes but would be useful and maybe inspiring for anyone else.  Three areas caught my eye.  They are how to relate to residents suffering various debilitations and imminent death, resident loneliness, and spirituality.  The author sees loneliness as a significant negative factor in residents' lives and strongly advocates for getting visitors as well as family into the homes.  I expect that individual visitors, such as myself,  can't do much beyond what they already do, except maybe enlist others to visit the homes.  Ms Innis finds the spiritual aspect of life important in promoting physical and mental well being.

Please!: How to Survive Caring for Aging Parents	Books	3	7	51	N	N	Harrowing tale, but annoying writing style	The book details its author's harrowing struggle to look after her aged and declining parents in the face of her father's irrational and violent rage and resentment toward all her attempts and toward those she employs to help with home care.  The father's condition is not resolved by book's end, and seems insoluble.  The author suggests that it stems from an unhappy childhood, although misuse of some prescription drugs is implicated.<br />The author's intrusive and overly cute writing style distracts from this hair-raising yarn.  Perhaps she was overcompensating for the grief she was suffering.  I found the book hard to get through, because of the story and the writing style.  Persons facing a family situation similar to the author's would probably find at least moral support in these pages and maybe some practical help.  And there are 70 pages of appendixes dealing with causes of rage, behavior modification, long-term-care insurance, and Alzheimer's disease that might prove more useful.	2003-03-20

His detective Kurt Wallander is a likeable, middle-aged fellow with various personal and family problems, plus having to unravel a really nasty murder. It takes the entire book to to do, and I was totally surprised at how the thing was resolved. Along the way, the story conveys something of the feel and spirit of Sweden, or at least the author's version of it. A point that amused me, as an American accustomed to cops who shoot first and think about it later, is the Swedes' awkwardness when having to find their pistols and go after a nasty character. I've read three of the Wallander books, and all are engrossing throughout. The author composes in Swedish, but the translations are uniformly good, at least as far as this non-Swede can tell.	2003-01-29

This despite the fact that they may severely darken one's view of human nature.  Kaye's stories are beautifully crafted but harrowing tales populated by damaged characters struggling to live in the present, though their movements may seem more ruled by vivid recollections of the past.  As sadistic, perverted, and predatory as they may be, Kaye's characters are fully formed human beings striving for some measure of success and happiness in a Hollywood where lust, obsession, avarice, ambition, and predation seem to conspire against them at every turn.  Kaye is a literary Hieronymus Bosch, who artfully draws the reader into his scenes of torment by staging them against a backdrop of mundane cultural symbols with which most of us can identify, namely the popular music of the times and the locales and personalities that have become part of the Hollywood mystique.  Reading this book is like watching someone jump from a high building -- horrifying but too fascinating to turn away from.	2002-12-18

The ostensible plot has to do with the ex-cop, Gene Burk, finding out who years ago murdered a popular rock-and-roll musician, but in fact the story is more that of Burk's attempt to reconstruct the early life of his fiancee, who has died in a plane crash.  Charles Manson and the violence he instigated figure heavily in the story, but Manson emerges as a sort of twisted philosopher/poet of the corruption that infects everyone.  Manson seems to be only the most corrupted among a cast of damaged characters in a town where violence and predation abound.  The author's skill at evoking the names and events of Hollywood in mid-twentieth century make this an intriguing novel rather than just another sordid tale.	2002-12-12

In keeping with the style of the Bond books, the author has to spend considerable time describing what his characters wear, eat, drink, smoke, drive, etc. as Fleming and his stalwart pals end up trying to ward off attempts on Fleming's own life.  Casting Ian Fleming as the hero here was obviously inspired by the fact that the real Fleming was involved with British intelligence operations at one time.  The book is a pleasant and easy read, but the stilted dialogue and rather naive characters are not as much fun in today's world as they were when the Bond series first appeared.	2002-09-05

The main characters are a CIA operative, Major Mann, and the story's narrator, a nameless British agent. The plot twists are entertaining enough, but as in all of this author's better books, the real fun is in overhearing the conversations and the wry observations that reveal the characters and situations in which the coolly competent protagonists operate. Much of the pleasure in a Deighton novel lies in coming upon the author's clever turns of phrase -- as in a scene where our two agents are in the posh Florida home of a communist agent grilling the wife regarding her knowledge of his activities. She tries to maintain a facade of innocent southern gentility, but as her story is being picked apart item by item, she fiddles with her purse, which our narrator observes is \\"made from a couple of yards of the Bayeaux tapestry.\\"	2002-04-29

Howard Hughes' life had all the elements to make a titillating yarn -- Hollywood movie-making, dozens of sexy starlets, racing airplanes, spending millions of dollars on a whim, and a truly eccentric protagonist.  This bio is a page-turner because the subject's life was far more intriguing than any of the movies he strove so hard to create.  The author doesn't burden his narrative with the details of Hughes' business dealings, which could probably occupy several volumes in themselves.  Instead, we learn mostly about his personal relationships and obsessions.  The text could have stood another word-editing, as there are some questionable word choices and grammatical slipups, but these are minor irritations in a fascinating yarn.	2002-01-15

To avoid the public eye while recovering, he moves from his home in Bel Aire to a palatial estate on a mysterious and unnamed street in the hills above Sunset Blvd.  Here, he finds an unexpected occupant, the beautiful and youthful Katya Lipi, who claims to be a star of the silent era.  There prove to be many less substantial, but deadly, occupants about as well.  The estate turns out to be a place of  fear and promise for Todd.  The promise for the reader is that Todd will abandon himself to the magic of the place and thereby reclaim his youthful beauty and his career.  This may have seemed too trite for the author, however, and what we get is a promising setup, followed by a series of orgiastic and sadistic scenes involving the infernal occupants of Coldheart Canyon and various human interlopers.  There is a bit much of this battling ghosts and demons, and the novelty wears off long before we get to some sort of resolution.  Amusing photo of the author on the dust jacket, though.	2001-12-27

And it takes such gifts to make these characters worth following through an entire novel.  There is something familiar about his protagonist, Willie Chandran -- an unhappy young man, the offspring of a Brahmin married to a lower-caste woman, who seeks his future in England.  I cannot say he is seeking his fortune, because throughout the book, he seems never to actually do anything, either for himself or anyone else, that would garner him any material wealth.  He apparently has some writing talent and as a young man has published one small collection of stories, but that is the end of that.  For 18 of the 41 of Willie's years that the novel covers, he sponges off the family of a girl he has accompanied from London to her farming estate in Mozambique.  Aside from some sexual adventures with prostitutes and another man's wife, the book provides no insight into what Willie does with his time.  Anyway, after 18 years in Africa, he decides to leave and migrates to Germany, apparently to take up residence with his sister.  This is where the book ends.	2001-12-21

Probably because they realized their readers wouldn't know it without being told.  This is a novel lacking in action, either physical or intellectual, and in which the gimmick is revealed in the first chapter, or maybe even before.  It has to do with some folks who've been turned into automaton-like hitmen by one of those government research projects gone bad.  But do we get to go along on the hits? Not really.  There's one brief adventure at the front of the book, and the rest of the time we ride along while the sister of one of the hitmen (this one a girl) tries to find out why her sister committed suicide. She's accompanied by a guy who also underwent this mind-alteration, but who for no clear reason was set up as a psychologist rather than as a killer. He watches a lot of TV, apparently because he was programmed to. Along the way, they have to elude some guys in black, and their apartments are ransacked.  But mostly, they talk to people. The science behind all this mind-altering is pretty fuzzy, and the book contains a lot more writing than the plot and characters need. Surely, we can find better ways to spend our reading time.	2001-08-14

Anyway, the story has to do with Evan Tanner's adventures while venturing through southeast Asia in search of his girl friend, a jazz singer abducted during a tour.  The title &quot;The Scoreless Thai&quot; derives from the traveling companion Tanner acquires -- a young Thai lad aching to lose his virginity.  (Or did the young lad derive from the title?) The deal is that for having helped Tanner escape imprisonment, Tanner will see that this deflowering is accomplished.  This is an amusing little novel with plenty of action.  It doesn't suffer from the excessive cuteness Block can sometimes employ.	2001-07-30

This is a case where the economy of a well-crafted poetic line accomplishes what might take a page of prose.

No space is wasted on mundane logistical cataloging and diary-keeping.  Instead the reader is in the grip of perilous nature from beginning to end.

But in this volume, the first thing you might wonder is why two articulate people chose to affect such an inarticulate, though sometimes inventive, style.  All collections of Bukowski letters contain many cryptic and rambling missives of this sort, and I suppose they may be excused as the unedited utterings of a drunk and/or hung-over mind.  But I'm led to believe that Bukowski produced a lot of work in that condition, including his better-crafted stories; so why must the letters be so sloppy?  Even as first drafts, they're a bit much.  And why Ms. Martinelli chose to emulate this style is another question, unless of course she was similarly indisposed.  Maybe it was an accepted literary style in the '60s.  At any rate, it makes the book a slow slog, although some new insights into Bukowski's nature and ideas may be winnowed with diligent application.  Like many of the Bukowski-related volumes, this one seems to be more for the fan and collector than for the casual reader.  There are a few photos of the two authors in the center of the book.  Black Sparrow Press did its usual commendable job of design and production.	2001-06-19

(Bukowski fans, however, seem to develop a tolerance for the face, and in fact, it's a significant part of Bukowski's mystique.) There are about 240 pix in the book, several showing the covers of his various publications.  A good many are pretty fuzzy snapshots, although Bukwoski fans should find that of little import. They suit me fine, because I'm always curious about where and how people live, whom they associate with, and how they carry on their daily lives. The text is derived from Howard Sounes' research for his biography of Bukowski, and some of the photos appear in that book. Absent from that bio and from &quot;Bukowski in Pictures&quot; are any of the excellent photos by Michael Montfort, who shot most if not all of the author photos appearing in Bukowski's Black Sparrow Press editions, including the photos appearing in &quot;Shakespeare Never Did This.&quot;  All in all, I consider this a valuable addition to a Bukowski collector's library.	2001-06-06

The author devotes pages to repartee between the killer and his agent, both of whom are as cute as they can be trading bons mots for endless pages.  None of this has much if anything to do with the plot, such as it is. Here and there along the way, our hero treks off and kills someone, although the author elides all the nasty stuff that might make our hero less cuddly.  It's like a play in which all the interesting action happens offstage, leaving the actors merely talking about it on stage. If you're trapped on a long airplane ride, this book might be more entertaining than rehearsing your multiplication tables, but probably not as profitable.	2001-05-16

The kids spend their childhood with their grandparents in the midwestern U.S.  For some reason they never really seek separate lives during the 30 or so years spanned by the book.  Instead they move to New York as young adults, where they form a cutting-edge comedy troupe, performing routines based in social commentary with increasing success.  In their routines, the unchanging roles assumed by the four seem to include that of dog and a mute. Exactly how this works is not revealed, since the author offers no examples of their comedy.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine these four producing anything resembling comedy, since their lives reveal no hint of a sense of humor or any emotion other than fear, since much of the book deals with their attempts to elude a mysterious stalker.  This involves frequent changes of address.  The major character in the book, Sam, the eldest sibling and author of all the troupe's comedy scripts, does pursue a rather dilatory long-term mail romance with a fan, who apparently lives in easy walking distance from him. The two meet late in the novel, but nothing seems to come of it. This is a well-written novel, but I was left with two or three questions which the author probably didn't intend to be the legacy of her work - why and how do four intelligent siblings stay together well into adulthood with no outside attachments, and just how funny were these comedy skits that were apparently so successful, considering that two of the four characters apparently don't say anything:	2000-12-06

Although I tend to spend my journeys in one city and live in hotels, I found the advice to travel light, be aware of thieves, and to telephone in advance to prearrange reservations for visits to popular tourist attractions good reminders.  Especially the possibility of reserving time at museums in order to be admitted ahead of the line, an idea that never occurred to me before.  One quibble: the lists of useful agencies and addresses that begin on page 219 are set in a sans-serif type that makes the numeral one indistinguishable from the letter l and, I guess, capital I.

I first encountered Kinkade's work as elaborately framed &quot;paintings&quot; displayed in a gallery at the front of a local furniture emporium.  I was shocked to see four-figure prices attached to pieces that were obviously some sort of reproduction.  These prices led me to suspect a scam was under way, especially when I noticed blobs of white pigment standing in bas relief from the surface, obvously meant to give the illusion of a hand-painted work. When I asked a hovering saleslady whether she was aware the pieces were reproductions, she readily admitted they were.  And recently, an ad in the local paper invited all and sundry to come watch an expert from the Kinkade factory apply these white &quot;highlights&quot; to the lithographs, which are apparently shipped without them. I would suggest that the lithos be sold with a tube of paint so the buyer can apply his own &quot;highlights&quot; and thus create a real original.

But that aside, every book should  stand on its own, and this one was obviously tossed off in a week or so by  a bored and complacent writer and produced by an equally bored and cynical  publisher confident that the author's fans would shell out once again. This  piece, aside from its cardboard characters, ridiculous plot, and total  failure to develop any atmosphere for the numerous locations among which  the protagonists hop, is replete with grammatical and typographical  bloopers that no self-respecting writer or editor should commit. However,  this quality of work is becoming more the norm than the exception in pop  fiction. The state of modern fiction of this sort may be one good indicator  of the state of our educational system.	2000-09-11

By dint of energy, intelligence, and devotion to his roots he  became a pioneering farm broadcaster, reporter, and prime mover in programs  and events that year after year continue to join farm families all over the  world in improving farm practices.  Although he never obtained a  high-school or college degree, he was able to serve as a war correspondent  in WWII and Vietnam and later in Washington as public affairs assistant to  two secretaries of agriculture.  There is probably not a farmer or  small-town midwesterner of the twentieth century who does not recognize the  name Herb Plambeck from having heard his farm reports during his years on  WHO radio in Des Moines and reading his articles in Wallaces Farmer  magazine.  This well-illustrated and detail-filled memoir will bring to  mind many more names and events most of us have long forgotten and will  remind us just how important the farmer is in this world.  Would that we  could all lead the useful and adventure-filled life of Mr. Plambeck, and  then recount it so warmly and enthusiastically.	2000-07-28

In it, the author chronicles her development as an intelligent and talented young woman during the 1950's, beginning in Paris,  where her emigre Russian parents strove to carry on the Andreyev family  traditions in art and literature. While studying to become a painter, she  meets a handsome American student at the Sorbonne, marries, and moves to  America. There she dives into the New York art scene, studying with Robert  Motherwell and bcoming friends with those who became landmark figures in  20th century arts and letters. Her stoutness of character is indicated by  the fact that she persisted in bringing to Motherwell's class the small  still-life paintings whose techniques she was determined to master - having  to display them among the enormous, flat abstractions with which her  teacher and fellow students were enamored at the time. Rather than belabor  his charming young student regarding her entire approach to art, Motherwell  simply ignored her paintings. In later years, having become a respected  writer on Russian affairs, she becomes a conduit and agent for Alexander  Solzhenitsyn and other writers living under Soviet oppression.The author's  knack for evoking the mood of her times as well as the sights, sounds, and  smells of her surroundings, plus her lifelong dedication to the  intellectual life and intellectual freedom make this a satisfying and  inspiring read.	2000-06-13

The author is a thoroughgoing craftsman who spends a  good deal of his book painstakingly developing the characters and lives of  his protagonists, who include a dropout from the witness-protection  program, a homosexual hit man, an embittered journalist, and assorted loved  ones, cops, and victims. The author's writing skills are sufficient to keep  the reader interested until the real action begins, along about page 200.  And the story is resolved without requiring anyone to step completely out  of character, as is often a failing of lesser authors. This story is  basically that of an up-and-coming mobster who rats on his associates and  is granted federal protection. Some years later, having left the program  and achieved an honest life on his own, he finds himself pursued by the  past in the person of an ingenious killer with a grudge. It is the tragic  nature of such novels that the characters ultimately find themselves  responding to malevolent forces outside their control rather than acting on  their own volition. It's also interesting to note that in most formulaic  books such as this, nobody (notably the author) is permitted to display any  sense of humor or any ability to stand aside from or transcend the limits  of his situation. This lack of dimension makes such books and their  characters easy to forget, however entertaining they may be, and is in my  estimation a large part of what separates potboilers from good literature.  But I suppose that without the former to keep the presses rolling, there  would be no publishing business around when needed to produce the latter.	2000-06-03

The killer's distorted religiosity and schizoid  dependence on internal voices and messages from neighborhood dogs are  detailed. A parallel story follows the role of Berkowitz's neighbor, Craig  Glassman, a deputy sheriff and nursing student, who is an unwitting  influence on Berkowitz's actions. The brief narrative is supplemented with  articles from New York newspapers and reproductions of Berkowitz's  handwritten messages to himself and the police. The book might have  profited by more investigation of the killer's childhood and family life,  but this chronicle of his brief career in the limelight is scary enough.	2000-05-29

This is an entertaining and educational little volume of interviews with twelve screenwriters from Hollywood's &quot;golden age.&quot;  These folks all have tales of being disrespected and demeaned by producers and  directors and of being thwarted in creating their art.  But they all  survived and even thrived a little and have plenty of tales humorous and  horrendous of goings on in the movie business.  From Ivy-League  intellectual to newspaperman to truck driver, the subjects of these  interviews have in common the storyteller's knack, and that makes this book  a delight for those of us who like to know what goes on behind the scenes.  I wish there were twice as many interviews, though.  Filmographies for the  subjects appear at the back of the book, and there's a generous helping of  photos throughout.	2000-05-26

The resulting book is effective and  somewhat depressing. It answers the question &quot;whatever became  of...,&quot; by repeatedly illustrating that what becomes of even the most  radiant damsel is just what's in store for all of us if we live long  enough. The author is unfailingly flattering to each of his subjects, who  briefly recount their careers in front of the cameras and since retirement.  Some have obviously done quite well in later life, while others less well  situated express a wistful nostalgia for their past. Of course a good many  were in poor health when interviewed, and many have passed away since the  book came out in 1984. Accompanying each interview are one or more of the  carefully lighted, posed, and retouched photos that were made of the  subject in her heyday. These make stark contrast with the large  reproductions of the shots taken by Horst during the interviews. Although I  assume he set out to flatter his sitters with appropriate lighting and  poses, many of the shots appear harshly lighted (especially indoors), and  the prints reveal subject movement or other distracting fuzziness. I  appreciate that no soft-focus devices were used, but the lighting and  printing of the photos could have served many of these ladies better.  However, I've photographed enough people to realize that, if given the  choice, the subject doesn't always pick the shot you think is most  flattering.  On the other hand, many of these former stars still look as  lissome and fit as we remember them from 40 or 50 years ago. The book is  interesting, but I wonder if it came out quite as the author expected or  hoped it would.	2000-05-24

These include assistant directors, set designers and builders,  publicity men, actors' agents, sound recordists, and extras. We get insight  into the lives of artisans, most of whose names do not crop up in fan mags,  gossip columns, or in Oscar balloting. But these people harbor a great  affection for the movie business and their part in it. They express pride  in their accomplishments, unsung though they may seem. Where outsiders may  consider an Oscar the only valid reward available to members of the movie  community, an assistant director, camera operator, or sound recordist can  treasure a compliment from a film's director at the end of a hard day's  shooting just as much as a more public award. The moral of this book is  that the Hollywood life need not be lived in the public eye or on the grand  scale to be satisfying. My main quibble with the book is that I would have  liked the interviews to be longer and more numerous.	2000-05-18

We'd know a lot less about American movies if not for a few English movie buffs who crossed the pond to produce some of the best books on the topic. John Kobal was prominent in this group, having been smitten with American  films early on. His vast collection of photos yielded several books on its  own and is a standard source for illustrating Hollywood's past.  &quot;People Will Talk&quot; is not a photo book.  In its 700-plus pages  appear 41 interviews Kobal collected between 1964 and the mid-l980's. The  subjects are Hollywood veterans from various phases of the business.  Appearing are directors such as Howard Hawks, dance directors such as  Hermes Pan, writers (Anita Loos), photographers (e.g., John Engstead,  Hurrell). And of course plenty of actresses - and Joel McCrea, the only  actor appearing. When interviewed, most of the subjects were at the end of  their movie careers, and this, plus Kobal's insightful questioning,  resulted in objective, candid appraisals of their lives and the situations  and people involved. While the interviewer was not so rude as to question  his subjects' recollections during conversation, footnotes here and there  in the text correct what may have been lapses of memory. Each interview is  prefaced by a photo of the subject, plus Kobal's summary and evaluation of  the subject's career. Although I've read every interview in this volume  several times, writing this review was slowed considerably by my inability  to stop reading them again and turn to the typewriter. This is just the  book for movie fans who like to hear how it happened from the lips of those  who made it happen.	2000-05-17

Cameraman Joseph Walker was one of Hollywood's fine artists and true gentlemen. In this well-written volume, done in collaboration with his  wife, Mr.Walker presents a lively account of his youth during the early  l900s in Los Angeles, where his interest in the new field of wireless  communication led to his organizing and operating the first wireless radio  department in a major LA department store. It was this undertaking that led  to his association with Dr. Lee DeForest and the Wright brothers, and to  radio adventures in Mexico. But it was his fascination with motion-picture  photography that led him to become a newsreel and free-lance cameraman and  finally the premiere studio cameraman who filmed 18 of Frank Capra's 24  features, plus some 125 other films at Columbia and other studios. He was  known for making women look their best on film. Experiences during his long  career are vividly detailed, and the personalities and idiosyncracies of  those involved are affectionately recalled. And along the way, other  inventions, including a zoom lens and other optical devices springing from  Joe Walker's ingenious mind are described. About 80 photos from Mr.  Walker's scrapbook are included. Hollywood had only one golden age, and  only one Joe Walker, and though both are gone now, this book lets us share  their times once more.	2000-05-15

Besides plenty of bordellos and saloons to divert the hardworking  miners, the affluent citizens of Tombstone enjoyed concerts, elaborate  parties, and social events of various sorts. The exploits of some of the  more colorful lawmen and outlaws (sometimes they were one and the same) of  the Arizona territory were chronicled in the Epitaph's florid articles, and  the much-recounted shootout at the OK corral is detailed (Epitaph writers  went into almost clinical detail in describing gunshot wounds). The last  part of the book covers a disastrous blaze in one of the mines that shut  down mining and the town and then presents a series of exuberantly  optimistic articles in which new investors and mining engineers restore  mining activity by installing massive pumps to keep groundwater from  invading the ore face.  However, by 1908, the water had overwhelmed all  efforts, and Tombstone camp ceased to produce ore once and for all. The  book suffers some from the author's rather awkward writing, but the book is  mostly taken directly from the pages of the Epitaph, and his selection of  colorful and evocative prose by various Epitaph editors and reporters  conveys the life and times of this vibrant community very well.	2000-05-15

Diagramming is also a great tool to use in  arguing various points of construction. The book also includes general  rules and approaches to building complete manuscripts.

In this page-turner, we find the author at the top of his form, with Hoke  fully engaged in his life as a cop and family man. While busily solving a  &quot;cold&quot; murder case, Hoke is dispatched on a puzzling and  hazardous undercover job in a neighboring county. At the same time, a  parolee who some years earlier had promised to kill him moves in right  across the street from Hoke's house (how this turns out is what separates  Willeford from the pack). In the house, Hoke lives with his two teenage  daughters and his former officemate Ellita Sanchez and her infant son. With  everyone in his unconventional but harmonious family contributing their  share, Hoke is free to spend some time in his bedroom, pondering his  problems and watching TV cop shows. And how unusual it is to find a cop  enjoying a satisfactory family life! In a few brief sentences, Willeford  suggests how this is managed - a sort of primer for disfunctional  households, perhaps. Throughout the story's beautifully detailed and  ingenious turnings, Hoke manages by dint of his experience and common sense  to save his skin and do the right thing in general, which in some instances  consists in doing nothing. At the end of the novel, he finds himself being  coerced by his superiors into accepting a promotion in grade and assignment  as head of internal affairs - a position he comes to realize he is well  suited for. But that intriguing eventuality would have been the subject of  another book, wouldn't it.	2000-05-07

Even the title is intriguing, although it has little to do with the story behind it.  After savoring the title, you will find that this is a real &quot;buddies&quot; yarn, consisting largely of first-person versions of  the same events seen from different points of view. The four main  characters, though differing considerably in personality and profession,  have in common their age (mid-30's), residence (Miami apartment complex),  and an interest in picking up women. In fact, it is the pickup game that  leads to the inconvenient incident of the teenage druggie dying of an  overdose in the car. Willeford uses this event to introduce the idea that  these men are not just drinking pals but that their relationship pervades  their lives in various ways. We see how they complement one another in  collaborating to get rid of the body.  And this sort of problem occurs a  couple more times, since they do have this difficulty with handguns in that  whenever a pistol appears, someone ends up embarrassingly dead. But  Willeford disposes of the bodies between chapters, without bothering the  reader with details.  Because he is not writing a crime novel.  These  violent happenings are introduced to see how the four friends will react as  a group.  He manages to create plenty of suspense by dealing with how the  group collaborates in solving their individual and complicated domestic  problems.  And he is inventive enough to keep the reader hooked until the  end.  Willeford's expert writing provides a transparent window into his  characters' lives.  He is so accomplished that you almost think you could  do it yourself.  As in other of his novels, he finds opportunity to  satirize men's clothing styles (early on, he discovered the vein of humor  uncovered by whoever induced men, or their wives, to believe that male  clothing styles should change every year or so - remember the Nehru  jacket?). I read this book while recuperating from minor abdominal surgery,  and the description of the &quot;makout&quot; attire affected by one of the  buddies put me in danger of literally splitting my sides.

In his later works, Charles Willeford seemed to view the world as greedier and more desperate, and society seemed to be falling apart. He used sardonic  humor to chronicle the desperation of various unsavory characters, and no  one appears to be uninfected by ulterior motives. Disturbing scenes of sex  and violence occupy more pages. The earlier work Pick Up takes place in a  much kinder world.  People are more civil to each other, and not everybody  has a hidden agenda.  The main character in this book, Harry Jordan, wishes  to die, but he is so passive and ineffectual that his best hope of  achieving it turns out to be a possibility of execution by the state when  he is arrested for the death of his woman companion. In Willeford's hands,  the prison where Jordan awaits trial resembles a well-run three-star hotel.  Jordan is given a single room, which he describes as being quiet (there  seem to be no other inmates in this facility), food is good, and there is a  jailer who performs like a competent hall porter, providing Jordan with  various amenities to make his stay pleasant. In one scene, Jordan finds his  street clothes have been returned to him laundered, with his shirt in  cellophane. Law-enforcement personnel are depicted as bent only on serving  justice, contrary to the image accorded them in today's news reports and  fiction. Although I lived during this time, the world didn't seem quite so  benevolent. I read this book with more amazement at its sociological point  of view than with interest for its characters, whose self-destructive  aspirations seemed more affectation or the product of mental illness than  the logical result of social forces or personal inadequacy.	2000-05-04

Hurrell's career is considered in  phases, and in each his working methods and even his frame of mind are  considered.  The author is especially astute at this because he is a  photographer who chooses to work as Hurrell did, with 8x10 b&amp;w film and  incandescent light, with pencil retouching on the film.  Shots of Hurrell's  studio in action are included, along with examples of before-and-after  retouching.  This isn't a full-blown how-to-do-glamour book, but it makes  me want to stow the strobes and break out the 30-year-old floods and spots.  Mark Vieira has added to his rep as a Hollywood historian, and any movie  fan would do well to take advantage of this product of his scholarship.	2000-05-01

Although not the scandalous,  x-rated outtakes you may have expected (hoped for?), the photos are all  interesting, partly because many of them seldom appear in Hollywood picture  books.  The well-written text details the code, difficulties enforcing it,  and the personalities who devised and promulgated it.  Code enforcement  apparently found it had to deal more with moral implications, suggested  relationships, and what might be going on just outside the frame than with  what showed up onscreen (which may explain the absence of racy pix). This  doubly satisfying book certainly belongs in the library of any movie  scholar or serious fan and adds to the stature of its author as a movie  historian..	2000-04-27

Since I wrote the review below, I've received later books of Hurrell work in which the reproductions are much better.  Consequently, I'd say don't buy this volume unless it's dirt cheap on the second-hand market.<br /><br />I wrote this in 2000:  Perusing this coffee-table volume is as close as most of us will get to flipping through a stack of George Hurrell's own prints. There is virtually no text, just a brief chronology of the photographer's life and career. But before reaching that, you will see examples from 62 years of his work  represented in 140 12-1/4 by 9-5/8-inch duotone plates, many of them shots  that created the world's image of Hollywood in the 30's and 40's. The book  proceeds chronologically, so that toward the end are post-WWII shots  revealing that not even Hurrell could evoke glamour without the right  subjects and environment.  And the last plate in the book is a Dutch angle  of the master himself, still shooting but obviously nearer the end than the  beginning. Technically, the book is well printed, with the duotone process  enhancing the large dark areas Hurrell loved to create. For my taste, he  tended to print his darks too dark and lacking in detail, although his  compositions usually supported these big \\"velvety\\" areas.  However, achieving that look with ink often leads printers to darken the  lighter end of the grey scale, too. And in this book, some plates ended up  looking a bit muddy. But this is probably a minor quibble for true seekers  after Hollywood's lost glamour.	2000-04-26

The main thing I gathered from this book is that the author is a really nice guy with a nice mother, a loving wife, and a very tolerant publisher.  He writes pretty good, too, and I'd love to have him for a neighbor.  He  needed a subject for his first book, so he wrote about Las Vegas. And if  you want to make Las Vegas pretty boring, sending a really nice, properly  brought up young man to cover it looks like the way to go. Suspecting that  merely detailing his amateurish attempts to beat the house would make a  pretty dull book, the author managed to interview a few potentially  colorful characters.  Alas, he seemed to find them to be pretty much like  himself, i.e., not all that interesting after all.  Anyway, about the time  his mother and his wife arrived for Easter, or some other holiday (this was  soon after he helped the Boy Scouts, or somebody, clean up the desert, or  some such), I fell to organizing my socks drawer just to get the old  adrenaline flowing again.  Well, it seemed at least as exciting as Las  Vegas.	2000-04-26

A brief 30-page recap of the history of still photography in the movie industry is followed by 255 pages showing examples of the work  of 43 of the most notable stills men (including two women) who snapped the  stars, scenes, and environment of the movies during their first 60 years. A  brief chronology of the career (as far as it is known) of each photog is  included.  All the photos are given their best reproduction on heavy  enameled (I believe that's the term) paper. It does make you wish more  books containing work by Ted Allan, Bob Coburn, and other Hurrell  contemporaries had been published.	2000-04-25

Dennis Kitchen thought it would be fun to visit each of the 50 states and take a picture of the entire population of the smallest community in each.  And that's basically what this book is - 50 panoramic photos of groups of beaming citizens posing in  the midst of their tiny towns. Part of the genius of the thing is that the  wide-angle lens shows not only the people, but also captures the buildings,  streets, trees, mountains, and local dogs - i.e., what makes each community  unique.  The other part is that all but one of the communities fell right  in with the author's idea (in that instance he shot the town but not the  people). The text accompanying the photos recounts the ingenious ways some  of the mayors devised to encourage their townsfolk to all be at the same  place at the same time (not always 100-percent successful, but always  close).  Also recounted are various citizens' wry observations about life  in a very small town.  And when you ponder the photos, you realize that the  folks looking out at you know a lot more about each other than a bookful of  photos could reveal. But that's how it gets in small towns.  All in all,  this book leaves me feeling that just about anyone would be welcome in  these 50 spots, even without a camera.	2000-04-25

However, the  display of 137 historic gas-station photos suffers from rather muddy  reproduction on matte-surface paper that prevents showing the detail to be  found in the original glossy prints. (On slick magazine paper, I've seen  many of these same photos come to life. Why any photo book is printed on  anything but slick paper is beyond me.)  Despite this, the sheer volume of  stuff and the text outlining the history of gasoline merchandising should  be enough to engage the imagination of highway travel fans.	2000-04-23

Besides tracing the evolution of gas-station architecture, gas pumps themselves, and petrol merchandising,  the book displays top-quality photo reproduction.  This is especially to be  appreciated for the way it shows the details in the older pictures, which  were made in the days of slow, fine-grain films. And the book's generous  page size helps the photos stand out, too. There's a good bibliography to  further stoke the nostalgia.	2000-04-22
