With that being said, the one thing I did notice, even with all the negative comments by other readers, was that everyone who read THE SMOKE JUMPER finished it.<BR>Nicholas Evans is a natural storyteller.  With unassuming and graceful prose, convincing dialogue and fully realized characters, THE SMOKE JUMPER is an old-fashioned tear-jerker, a highly readable and captivating story about friendship, love, loyalty, guilt and honor.

For a first book, I felt as if I had walked into the middle of the series, and more than a little confused as I continued reading. Laurell K. Hamilton and Anita Blake however, were just intriguing enough to make me want to continuing reading what seems to be a fun series.  If you liked this book, definitely try BITTEN.	2002-03-21

While most of Nash's story is at times heartbreaking, it is also a story of his great accomplishment, that is ulitmately uplifting and full of hope.<BR>Even if you have seen the film, read the book.

RAPTOR has neither.<BR>The story is flat and unconvincing, the characters are one dimensional, and it appears that the author Dorsey Fiske, did absolutely no research in police investigation while writing this book. It also seems as if the author is a foreigner (perhaps British?) attempting to pass his or her self off as American. The dialogue and expressions the author chose to use are definitely not ones that Americans use. In fact, the dialogue and relationships, particularly the one between Kate and her ex-husband seem forced and pretentious.<BR>Perhaps I read a completely different book, but I'm puzzled by some of the other reviews I've read here raving about it. RAPTOR was hardly worth the time it took me to read it.	2001-09-02

You're thinking who needs another legal thriller when the genre is maxed out already, and I personally couldn't squeeze another onto my own bookshelf. But with SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, lawyer and debut novelist Sheldon Siegel gives us Mike Daley, an ex-public defender, ex-priest and ex-partner in a powerful and prominent law firm in San Franciso. When Daley becomes involved in defending his best friend and former colleague against a double murder charge, not only does he discover his friend is not the man he appears to be, but uncovers some secrets long hidden by his old firm. Siegel's voice is fresh, and the writing draws you in from the very first sentence. Likeable, smart, funny, and vulnerable, Mike Daley is one of the few lawyers in fiction (maybe the only one) that proves wrong the theory that you can't trust a lawyer. Bravo to Mr. Siegel for bringing a breath of fresh air to the legal thriller and continued success with your writing and the Mike Daley series!	2001-08-24

After seeing a PBS special on the way the face of God has evolved in art which included some of the works of Michelangelo, I was interested to read about his life.

With prose so beautiful it brings to life the desperation of Bartholomew Crane as he slowly suffers a personal breakdown and redemption, and the cold, white desolation of Northern Canada, LOST GIRLS has a creepy atmosphere that compels you to keep turning pages.	2001-07-03

When he discovers that the pickpocket is the beautiful and headstrong Gina Furey, Colin falls hard for her, and his life changes forever. Convincing himself that he's just doing research, Colin is swept up into Gina's world, and before he realizes it, the fine line between fiction and reality blurs as Colin's life with Gina slowly unwinds as his next film.   Like the spell Gina casts on Colin, FORK IN THE ROAD casts a spell on the reader as well.  Gina is a character that the reader loves to hate, but ultimately can't help liking, and one of the most interesting and unique characters in fiction. Unlike anything Denis Hamill has written before, FORK IN THE ROAD is an unforgettable and engaging novel that at times is hilarious and charming, and poignant and heartbreaking.	2001-05-09

Unsatisfied with the privilege and comfort that life has dealt too easily to him, Frank abandons it all.

Browsing through the bookstore as I am apt to do on a weekend, I was attracted to this book by its clever title and the cute little hearses on the cover. THE HEARSE YOU CAME IN ON is a highly entertaining and hilariously funny mystery, reminiscent of the best screwball comedies of the 30's. In a genre that seems to be cluttered by tortured, angst-ridden protagonists, Hitchcock Sewell is a truly original and refreshing change.  He's young, handsome (if he does say so himself) and an undertaker!<br />With its likeable characters, razor sharp wit and snappy dialogue, THE HEARSE YOU CAME IN ON draws you in from the first sentence and keeps you turning pages.  I look forward to many more books featuring undertaker/sleuth Hitchcock Sewell!	2001-04-26

THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is an epic novel spanning thirty years that tells the story of the Price family, Baptist missionaries who leave their home in Georgia in 1959 and head to the Belgian Congo. The novel is told in the alternating voices of Orelanna Price and her four daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May. This is the first book by Ms. Kingsolver that I've read, and it will certainly not be the last.  This is a novel of greath power and depth.

As both a reader and a writer, I LOVE John Irving---his novels are quirky and funny, and I could only hope to write a novel as good as A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR. Lusty, quirky and laugh-out loud funny, A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR deals with love---between child and parent, between men and women, and the devastating grief of a parent's loss of a child. At the age of four, Ruth Cole is abandoned by her mother Marion, and left in the care of her father Ted, a writer of children's books and a notorious womanizer.  A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR is essentially Ruth's story, following her life for the next thirty-six years as she becomes a best-selling novelist, and struggles to come to terms with her love-hate relationship with her father and her abandonment by her mother, as she searches for real love and longs for a family of her own. A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR is an engaging and compulsively readable novel, filled with eccentrically human characters and deep emotion.  This is definitely one of Irving's best!	2000-10-13

Although it's undeniably well written  and a page turner as well, HANNIBAL is flat, and unsatisfying.  After  SILENCE, the motivations behind the actions of Special Agent Starling and  Dr. Lecter don't seem to be true to the previous book and left me  scratching my head.

With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult just keeps getting better.  Like KEEPING FAITH, the story of a little girl who seems to be a religious visionary, Picoult takes  controversial topics and weaves incredible stories from them. KEEPING FAITH  is not only a story of the love of a mother for her child, but an  examination of the issues of religion, and the effects of media  oversaturation. Picoult writes with an overwhelming grace, beauty and deep  sensitivity, and her novels are always thought provoking.  Picoult gives  her loyal readers the gift they've always wanted with each new book.  To  those who have not had the pleasure of reading her books, pick up KEEPING  FAITH.  And then, do yourself a favor, and pick up the rest of her novels  as well.	2000-05-24

It seems that each decade has a writer who has made an impression in the PI genre...Chandler, Hammett,Leonard. The new millennium has Dennis Lehane. As an avid reader and unpublished writer, I can appreciate the work that  goes into crafting a  good story.  Some authors are able to craft stories,  but don't have that &quot;internal gift&quot; that is given to only a few  fortunate writers.  Dennis Lehane is one author who has truly been blessed  with that gift. PRAYERS FOR RAIN comes at you like a speeding train, and  never lets up.  Lehane is a master at dialogue, his prose is sublime.  When  you find yourself caring about fictional characters, absolute in your  belief that they are real, you know you're reading a book by a great  writer. The Kenzie/Gennaro series should NOT be missed...I can't say enough  about Dennis Lehane.  My only regret is that I have to wait for his next  novel...I hope the wait isn't long.	2000-05-04

Currently, I have read three of her novels,MAN CRAZY, BROKE HEART BLUES and DOUBLE DELIGHT.  Her writing style is always interesting, but at times, unpredictable, and while some of her novels are  conventional, others are more free-style and sometimes difficult to get  through. DOUBLE DELIGHT, written under the pseudonym of Rosamond Smith, is  one of her more conventional novels, an intricately plotted, psychological  thriller that keeps you always guessing.  A story of seduction, sexual  obsession and deception, that drives an ordinary, upstanding man, Terrence  Greene to commit extraordinary crimes in the name of passion. DOUBLE  DELIGHT is an excellent book for the JCO novice to begin with.  She is a  wonderful writer, one of the masters of the psychological suspense genre.	2000-05-02

As usual, Ms. Shreve's writing is insightful, with a lyrical rhythm that captures the speech cadences and thoughts of the  characters of St. Hilaire and paints a clear picture of the New England  surroundings. Ms. Shreve's choice to tell the story through eyewitness  accounts of the characters, as well as the notes of Maureen English allows  the reader to draw their own conclusions as to what the true underlying  story is.

Mr.  Schwartz took the topic of a hit and run accident (an issue dealt with in  another fine novel THE LONG RAIN) and added a different twist. His prose is  so powerfully compelling, you feel the desperation of Dwight, and the  anguish of Ethan and Grace build with each turn of the page.
