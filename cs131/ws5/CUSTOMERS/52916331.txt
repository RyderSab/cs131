US	52916331	R60SW8PNW18WG	9628815229	369493109	Chinese Bilingual Bible (Blue, Traditional Chinese) (English and Taiwanese Chinese Edition)	Books	5	28	28	N	N	New version, not yet available in the PRC	<br />The New Chinese Version (xinyiben NCV 1992) is a conservative translation, a half way house between the honoured and respected Chinese Union Version [heheben CUV 1919] and the Today's Chinese Version [xiandaiben TCV 1975, mainland edition 1997]. As such the NCV combines the readability of the TCV with the word-for-word literalism of the CUV. That has to be welcomed, but let the reader be aware that the origins of the NCV and the more conservative line in translation show that it is in part a step back from the TCV.  <br /> <br />The NCV makes great claims for accuracy, largely at the expense of the TCV which is its only serious competitor - not making any comparison in this review with the Chinese Living Bible [dangdai shengjing 1979]. It's difficult to say whether TCV or NCV is more likely to follow the original Hebrew and Greek in any given verse. As a rule of thumb the NCV is a more faithful translation - such as in the Beatitudes where TCV infamously has \\"the meek shall inherit what God has promised\\" and where NCV restores the Matt 5:5 quote of Psalm 37:11 \\"inherit the earth\\" found in Greek and CUV. However the TCV is less driven by theological orthodoxy than the NCV, and consequently is less conservative in this sense too. <br /> <br />1. CHRISTOLOGY <br />When comparing versions, verses with Christological implications show a slight, but perceptible, difference in translation philosophies. For example in 1 Tim 2:5 the CUV inserts \\"descended as a\\" [jiang shi wei] in front the \\"man Christ Jesus\\" [ren de Jidu Yesu], with three dots under each character to show that it is not in the Greek original. The three dots are the equivalent signal as italics in some verses of the English KJV. In 1 Tim 2:5 the TCV changes \\"descended as\\" to \\"made as\\" [cheng wei]. But the NCV returns to the CUV reading. These differences should not be exaggerated - all three versions delete Jesus' reference to himself as \\"a man\\" in John 8:40 but preserve \\"man\\" referring to Jesus in Acts 2:22, 13:38, 17:31, Romans 5:15. In 1 Corinthians 15:47 TCV changes \\"second man\\" to \\"second Adam\\", the NCV reverts back to CUV and Greek. <br /> <br />The above example leads naturally to the subject, as discussed by Carson in 'The King James Debate', of which version is 'more Trinitarian' in its choice of variant Greek manuscript readings. In Romans 9:5 the CUV adopts the strongest reading \\"Christ.. he is God over all\\", the TCV follows a neutral reading \\"God who is over all be blessed for ever\\" with two alternatives in the  footnotes, the NCV returns to a strong Trinitarian reading. Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1, the area of Greek scholars' dispute over Granville Sharp's rule, are given both readings in CUV, the TCV gives a choice of footnotes in Titus 2:13 and a neutral reading in 2 Peter 1:1, only the NCV adopts a Trinitarian reading in both verses, with no alternatives noted.  <br /> <br />In Romans 15:6 the CUV avoids the neutral reading that God is \\"the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\\" but TCV allows it and NCV follows TCV. In 2 Cor.11:31 all 3 versions follow the Greek \\"God and father of the Lord Jesus\\". <br /> <br /> <br />2. HEBREW <br />None of the versions is particularly faithful to Hebrew concepts of mortality, or the translation of 'nephesh' as a being rather than the 'soul' inside a being. For example in Genesis 2:7 and Numbers 6:6 different words are adopted for 'living soul' and 'dead soul' in all three Chinese versions. But then this is the case in most English versions too. <br /> <br />In Job 19:26, where the Massoretic Text has \\"in my flesh I will see God\\", CUV has \\"outside my flesh I will see God\\", TCV has something closer to the Hebrew: \\"from my body I will see God\\", NCV restores \\"outside my flesh I will see God\\".  <br /> <br />A demonstration of the way the NCV is closer to the KJV, Morrison Bible of 1830 and CUV than TCV comes in the way the translators treat one Hebrew word 'ruakh', breath: <br /> <br />Ecc 3:19 CUV \\"breath\\", TCV \\"breath\\", NCV \\"breath\\" <br />Ecc 3:21 CUV \\"soul\\" TCV \\"soul\\" NCV \\"soul or spirit or breath\\" <br />Ecc 8:8 CUV \\"life\\", TCV \\"not die\\", NCV \\"wind or life\\" <br />Ecc 11:5 CUV \\"wind\\", TCV \\"life\\", NCV \\"wind\\",  <br />Ecc 12:7 CUV \\"spirit\\", TCV \\"breath\\", NCV \\"spirit\\" <br /> <br />From these examples it can be seen that the TCV is the least concerned to avoid the implication of mortality in the Old Testament, reminiscent of the English TEV's approach to such verses, while the CUV and NCV translations are more likely to support the concept of an immortal soul. <br /> <br /> <br />3. UTILITY <br />That is probably enough for most readers to gain an impression of where the NCV stands relative to the TCV and CUV. At the moment however it is somewhat academic as the TCV, not the NCV, is the modern version that has been adopted, albeit without much enthusiasm, by the Chinese State churches. It does not have the mantle of the Morrison Bible of 1830 in the way the 1919 CUV does, but at least a modern language version is now available, subsidised by the State, in most State church book kiosks for 14 yuan, i.e. less than two dollars. The NCV, carried in from Hong Kong, is prohibitively expensive compared to the TCV.  <br /> <br />However neither TCV nor NCV is likely to make much headway against the CUV until a range of study aids is available. The CUV has a marginal reference version, two full study Bibles, a full concordance [shengjing huibian], a giant four volume commentary, DVDs of Matthew, Luke and Acts, CDs and cassettes of readings. The TCV and NCV have none of these aids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />4. BINDINGS <br />As regards the NCV-English Standard Version parallel text version reviewed here, there are a variety of sizes, bindings and colours available. The text is also available in simplified mainland script and traditional Hong Kong script: <br /> <br />ISBN 962-8815-14-8 Standard/Traditional/Black/White edge <br />ISBN 962-8815-15-6 Standard/Traditional/Black/Gold edge/Leather <br />ISBN 962-8815-20-2 Compact/Traditional/Black/White edge <br />ISBN 962-8815-21-0 Compact/Traditional/Black/Gold edge/Zipper <br />ISBN 962-8815-22-9 Compact/Traditional/Navy/White edge <br />ISBN 962-8815-23-7 Compact/Traditional/Navy/Silver edge/Zipper <br />ISBN 962-8815-16-4 Compact/Simplified/Black/White edge <br />ISBN 962-8815-17-2 Compact/Simplified/Black/Gold edge/Zipper <br />ISBN 962-8815-18-0 Compact/Simplified/Navy/White edge <br />ISBN 962-8815-19-9 Compact/Simplified/Navy/Silver edge/Zipper <br />* The \\"white edge\\" editions are hardback, the zipper leather. <br /> <br />It goes without saying that whenever ordering any Bible be careful with ISBN and ASIN numbers to be sure you are getting the version you want. <br /> <br />The compact parallel text version ISBN 962-8815-17-2 has no references whatsoever - not in English or Chinese - to NT quotes of OT verses, but does have a Chinese introduction and synopsis to each book, as well as very brief English introduction, and a partial English concordance at the back. There is a history chart from Eden to Patmos in Chinese, and 18 colour bilingual maps. The ESV concordance has 2,700 headwords and 14,500 verse references. Unfortunately I cannot comment on whether the Standard size version has a different concordance or better notes. It definitely has larger print. <br /> <br /> <br />I hope this review has been of some use to purchasers. Both TCV and NCV are a considerable improvement in readability over the CUV and to be welcomed with open arms and five stars.	2005-06-13
US	52916331	R17NHIJ9LZC9LD	1578632595	825490084	The Book of Enoch the Prophet	Books	2	88	99	N	N	Revival of fallen angel legends from c.200 BC	For those that are familiar with the Enoch literature this is a reprint of R.H. Charles shorter SPCK translation, not a facsimile of the full 1912 edition with all Charles' essays and notes. The extra pages are occupied with an introduction by R.A. Gilbert who has prefaced another half dozen similar genre reprints from the same publisher. That means this is 1 Enoch (Aramaic-Coptic Enoch), not 2 Enoch (Slavonic Enoch) or 3 Enoch (Hebrew Enoch). The 3 books, together with 'Jubilees' represent 4 very different versions of fallen angel myths. R.H. Charles' translations were ground-breaking at the time but for anyone with a serious interest in Jewish literature it is now no substitute for the scholarly translations of all 4 texts, among others, found in 'The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: Apocalyptic Literature and Testaments (Old Testament Pseudepigraphia Vol 1) by James H. Charlesworth.  Supplemented perhaps by Enochic material in the Dead Sea Scrolls (Vermes or Martinez editions).<br />For those that are not familiar with the Book of Enoch what we have here is a legend originating as a midrash on Genesis 6 (concerning the \\"sons of God and the daughters of men\\") in the time of the Maccabees. Although a lot of the midrashic material in the book is taken from elsewhere than Genesis. Such as the famous (or infamous) Jude 14 quote of from 1 Enoch 1:9, where Jude's quote is in turn a midrash based on Deuteronomy 33:2, i.e. words spoken by Moses and not the Biblical Enoch of whom no words are recorded. An account of the origin and growth of the Enoch myth in Second Temple period Judaism [aka \\"the Intertestamental Period\\"] is found in 'Jewish Literature Between the Bible and the Mishnah: An Historical and Literary Introduction' by George W. E., Nickelsburg.<br /><br />The myth's reception in both Judaism and early Christianity was mixed. The Pharisee author of Liber Antiquarum known as Pseudo-Philo, and several pre-Mishnah and pre-Talmud rabbis rejected the interpretation of Genesis 6 'sons of God' as being about the fall of angels and they were followed in this by Jesus of Nazareth who said that \\"angels do not marry\\" and equated \\"the sons of God\\" with \\"sons of the resurrection\\". But equally Josephus, also a Pharisee, and Philo seem to have accepted the basic premise of the Enoch story. The book's popularity is illustrated by the various copies found at Qumran.<br />Both Peter and Jude quote from 1 Enoch more than is commonly realised. Peter's description of \\"chains of darkness\\" is drawn on the angel Uriel imprisoning the 200 fallen angels in Tartarus. Likewise Jude's \\"Enoch the seventh from Adam\\" is itself a quote from 1 Enoch not Genesis. This has led many readers, including R.A. Gilbert the editor of this reprint, to assume that Peter and Jude accepted the book as scripture. Of course quoting a book only proves you accept the book if you then agree with it. Those making this assumption tend to skip over such comments as Jude saying Michael would \\"not even rebuke\\" other heavenly beings - when the central event of 1 Enoch is the complaint of Michael to God in the heavenly throne room against the 200 fallen angels which gives Michael, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael license to imprison them. Anyway, buy a translation of Enoch, read Peter and Jude and make up your own mind about whether they consider 1 Enoch scripture or, in Peter's words, \\"cunningly devised fables\\". You might also note that all extant Greek manuscripts of Jude have \\"Enoch prophesied TO these men\\", not \\"ABOUT these men\\" as the KJV has it. Small word, big difference. After the early Christian period Enoch enjoyed a vogue in the period from Tertullian (a real Enoch enthusiast) to Origen. After which the development of a new doctrine for the origin of the Devil based on Isaiah made Enoch redundant and it was sidelined into Coptic and Slavonic Christianity. Jews largely rejected the fallen angel myth from Trypho the Jew onwards - and Enochic material was excluded from both Jewishand Christian editions of the Septuagint, the Vulgate (and hence the apocrypha of the modern Jerusalem Bible), Mishnah, and Talmud.<br />In the modern era Enoch has come back into fashion again, partly due to the discovery of copies in Africa and Israel, partly due to the evident appeal of a story which tells the gaudy details of heavenly beings' sexual relations with human women and the fall of the rebel angels on which the Bible is so disappointingly negative.<br />For those to whom this story has less inherent appeal it is also interesting - if only to show what the NT writers were competing with.nd Christian editions of the Septuagint, the Vulgate (and hence the apocrypha of the modern Jerusalem Bible), Mishnah, and Talmud.<br />In the modern era Enoch has come back into fashion again, partly due to the discovery of copies in Africa and Israel, partly due to the evident appeal of a story which tells the gaudy details of heavenly beings' sexual relations with human women and the fall of the rebel angels on which the Bible is so disappointingly negative. <br />For those to whom this story has less inherent appeal it is also interesting - if only to show what the NT writers were competing with.	2003-08-29
US	52916331	R1SJMXA9K6QVI5	0385497512	182715423	Introduction to Rabbinic Literature	Books	3	18	19	N	N	Useful, but lacking basic nuts and bolts information	Having bought or borrowed several other books by Neusner I sort of knew what to expect and have found the survey of Rabbinical Literature useful - certainly in terms of literary form. <br />However one major ommission that really should have been included in an &quot;Introduction&quot; is basic contextual information such as dates of composition and addition, transmission, current extant texts and so on. In other words the sort of text-by-text information you would find before each section in a good introduction to Dead Sea Scrolls or Pseudepigrapha. This is less relevant perhaps to Rabbinical Literature where transmission is part of the tradition, but that doesn't change the fact that, as with any ancient, or even medieval, text there are still variant text sources for many of the documents described and an estimate of place and time of composition and transmission is useful. Having looked at various chapters I'm still not a great deal wiser &quot;did this document come out of Sephardic North Africa 500CE or Ashkenazi Silesia a thousand years later?&quot;, &quot;does it exist in one editio princeps or 100 local variants?&quot; etc. And it would have (presumably) been so easy to address these questions at the start of each chapter.<br />But again, if you're mainly interested in literary form, then go for it. Neusner is excellent in these areas.	2003-04-09

This is probably due to their small numbers and lack of any formal organisation. Their principal distinguishing belief is that Jesus is the Son of God, not God the Son. <br />The author, Charles H. Lippy, Professor of Religion, Clemson University, South Carolina is a graduate of Dickinson College, Union Theological Seminary, NY, and Princeton University. <br />This book (1989) remains one of only two surveys of Christadelphian history, belief and practice by a non-Christadelphian. The other is Sects and Society by Brian Wilson (1961). As the title indicates the book is heavily focussed on the 10,000 or so Christadelphians in the USA and Canada, just as Wilson's is on the 25,000 or so Christadelphians in the UK. The main difference between the two books is that Lippey does not indulge in the often questionable sociological observations recurrent in Wilson's thesis. Quote:<br />\\"I do not offer a social or economic portrait of the people who are Christadelphians. My sense is that Christadelphians in socio-economic terms are virtually indistinguishable from the bulk of the population of the United and Canada ¡ª they are essentially middle-class folk who work hard for an honest living.  I have met Christadelphians who are medical specialists, social workers,  college professors, corporate executives, motel owners, dentists, accountants, and homemakers. I know Christadelphians who are employed in a variety of other occupations and professions. Virtually all that distinguishes Christadelphians from other Americans is their commitment to their understanding of religious truth. And it is that truth that I seek here to explicate.\\"<br />In introducing the table of contents, as follows, it is worth explaining two terms.  An \\"Ecclesia\\" is the word by which most congregations describe themselves rather than church. However Lippey's use of the term \\"founder\\" relating to John Thomas M.D., while arguablythe case in a historical sense, would not be used by Christadelphians themselves (due to 1 Corinthians 3:11) who tend to refer to Thomas and other early brethren only as \\"pioneers\\". Lippey, by taking a historical view inevitably overstates the relevance of Thomas, Williams, Roberts, Wilson and other early brethren to modern Christadelphians. Some of their writings hold interest, much as Luther's do to a Lutheran, or St. Augustine to a Roman Catholic, but they hold no authority beyond that of fellow Bible students.<br />TABLE OF CONTENTS<BR>1.

The early history of the Christadelphians, Latter Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, Exclusive Brethren, Christian Scientists, Spiritulists, The Jesus Army, Church of Christ and Rastafarians are thoroughly examined leading to a consideration of their present day worship, their core beliefs and practices.&quot;<br />The author is an academic at the University of Gloucestershire:<br />&quot;Nigel Scotland obtained an MA at McGill University and M.Litt from Bristol University. His PhD was on Methodism and Agricultural Trade Unionism. He is the author of several books including Charismatics and the Next Millennium (Hodder 1995) and John Bird Sumner: Evangelical Archbishop (Gracewing 1995). His recent publications include Sectarian Religion in Contemporary Britain (Paternoster, 2000), Good and Proper Men: Lord Palmerston and the Bench of Bishops (James Clarke &amp; Co, 2000), and Charismatics and the New Millenium (Eagle, 2000)&quot;.<br />Now for reviewer comments. <br />First off, this reviewer is a member of a Christadelphian church, one of the denominations reviewed in the book, so would-be purchasers of this book from mainstream churches might want to take any comments with a pinch of salt.<br />However I actually liked the book. One is so used to bearing the brunt of the Spanish inquisition that anything resembling an objective approach is like balm. Not that Scotland is a apologist for the unorthodox you understand - for example p.47 includes, in the main body of the text, a personal comment that the shema (Deuteronmy 6:4) &quot;is regarded by orthodox theologians as endorsing the Trinity&quot;. This comment is hardly pertinent to his case study, but it is worth mentioning to show would be purchasers that Scotland is still one of the good guys - the orthodox, and hasnot been beguiled by us heretics. And I noted that the tolerance displayed to my own church was not always in such evidence in dealing with some of the other denominations.<BR> <BR>Major reservations however are as follows. <br />Firstly - the sociology. <br />I was not convinced by the first two chapters on 'The Nature of Sectarian Religion' and 'The Variety of Sectarian Movements'. Too much of this was potboiling of previous writers on sectarian religion such as R. Robertson and B. Wilson. For example, Scotland's comments on sectarian organisational structure, are unreferenced and supported by scant case evidence. Of course models of organisational behaviour suggest some correlation between the age and size of an organisation and the degree of hierarchy, but with &quot;pyramidal&quot; structures including both the Watchtower Society and Church of England, and congregational structures in both 'orthodox' and 'unorthodox' groups, is there really any discernable pattern? And yes, several of the movements had strong personalities as early leaders - but what then were Luther, Calvin, Zwingli or Wesley?<br />Secondly - the quality of data and presentation. <br />In terms of proof-reading, data checking and referencing this book leaves a lot to be desired. I bought the book primarily as a reference for Spiritualism (ch8.) and Darbyite Exclusive Brethren (ch.5) about whom I know very little. But naturally I also read the chapter on my own church to get an idea of where the author was coming from. I was disappointed to see so many mistakes that, (since they were clearly not driven by any form of malice), can only be attributed to carelessness. How can I then have confidence in what is written about the other denominations?<br />That is a complaint which requires demonstration, so here are some trivial but basic errors regarding my own church. In only his second sentence Scotland says &quot;Christadelphians do not describe themselves as 'Christian'&quot; (p.36) and yet onp.42 quotes a leading Christadelphian referring to the movement as a \\"Christian Association\\" in a letter of support for registration as conscientious objectors during the Civil War. Similarly in his third sentence Scotland claims that Christadelphians see traditional churches as tainted by &quot;'hierarchical priestcraft'&quot;. Well perhaps, but where did this unfootnoted quote come from? (Having searched CD-Roms of early and recent Christadelphian works I cannot find the phrase in quotation marks anywhere). <br />Then we have factual inaccuracies that can only be attributed to rushed fieldwork. Scotland reports that each congregation &quot;appoints a 'Presiding Brother' who acts as chairperson for a year&quot; (p.36), then on p.56 he contradicts himself and says &quot;there are five presiding brethren who take it in turns&quot;. In fact if the author had visited the following Sunday he would have found that the chairperson would have rotated, along with the speaker, reader, organist, and three or four brethren giving prayers and readings. There might well be five if it were a small congregation, but there might equally be two, two dozen or no fixed number. Likewise it is not true that all congregations elect seven managing brethren annually.  Why seven? These careless mistakes suggest that the author's fieldwork has been limited to one visit to one meeting (presumably in Gloucester?), and data was not cross-checked to see if what was observed locally was typical. Again it is not true that &quot;only members are allowed to attend&quot; since most local congregations have children, unbaptised spouses, and friends attending. It is true that only the baptised take communion, if that is what the author means. One can understand that with nine denominations to study the author had a limited time for fieldwork, but these mistakes are the sort of thing that rudimentary checks should have caught (along with typos).<br />To sum up, if the above sounds negative that's simplybecause the value of having, at last, a non-vitriolic survey of the main &quot;unorthodox&quot; churches in the UK is diminished by the carelessness in data collection and presentation.	2003-03-30

A Comparison of the Arguments	Books	3	21	29	N	N	Okay presentation of non-Trinitarian view	It seems that the star ratings of most of the reviewers simply reflect their own beliefs. Trinitarians give *, non-Trinitarians *****. And I suppose my own *** just reflects mixed feelings. So it would seem then that the only way for browsers to know what this book is like is to buy or borrow a copy for oneself.<br />However I personally would be more inclined to recommend Rubinstein's 'When Jesus Became God' as a first read in this area. Firstly because its a good read. Secondly because, while Rubinstein is not remotely concerned with what the New Testament says, as a third party and a historian he does have something relevant to say about how the Trinity became such a big issue among Christians. Rubinstein gets *****.<br />Rating Holt among the few other similar non-Trinitarian works,  Buzzard & Hunting's 'Doctrine of the Trinity' and Broughton & Southgate's 'Trinity True or False' both get ****. Both are more complete and better argued than Holt, although the latter is currently not on US catalogues. A fourth book, Graeser, Schoenheit & Lynn's 'One God & One Lord' is less so. Among these four non-Trinitarian texts the thing that may stand in Holt's favour is that he represents the most common non-Trinitarian variant today, i.e. the one which accepts the existence of Jesus in heaven prior to his birth and his role in creating Adam. The Buzzard and Broughton books relate Jesus' role in creation in Colossians 1 etc, to the \\"new creation\\" rather than that of Genesis. In other words they follow a more Unitarian standpoint. Graeser, Schoenheit & Lynn seem a bit garbled on this point.<br />As for views of the Trinity, a typical orthodox view would be McGrath's 'Understanding the Trinity' or O'Collins, 'The Tripersonal God'. Which state a positive case. If you want a negative case then alternatively one can go down the road of the various cult-bashing books, but as I wouldn't like to have that on my conscience I won't recommend any titles. The arguments in these books are usually pretty trite and only good for confirming one's prejudices against minority religious groups.<br />As for theologians, you pays your money and takes your choice. They vary from the fairly orthodox (in the Athanasian sense)  Dunn 'Christology', and Rahner, to the various progressive Trinitarian theologians who say they \\"believe in the Trinity\\" but may not even believe in the virgin birth or resurrection. To be honest anyone getting this interested in the subject would probably be better off prioritising their time on source material: Rusch has edited two volumes of contemporary documents: The Trinitarian Controversy, and The Christological Controversy. In parallel with Rubenstein these make fascinating reading.<br />There's also the Bible of course, but it never mentions the Trinity, which makes it rather anachronistic for this subject.	2003-02-20

Shangti means an edition printed with two characters 'Shang Di' for &quot;God&quot;, a Shen Edition means an edition printed with a blank space followed by one character 'Shen' for &quot;God&quot;. If not specified it will usually be a Shen Edition. What the difference is between the two terms is open to debate.<br />Fortunately at least there is no written difference between Cantonese and Mandarin. This distinction is only relevant to audio tapes. Hong Kong Cantonese read traditional script. Over the border in Guangzhou PRC Cantonese read simplified script.

One reason for this is the objectivity that an academic outside the normal inner circle of writers on patristics brings to bear on the subject - coupled with the added objectivity that a Jewish (and one suspects agnostic) writer has in treating a controversy that is still live among Christians today. However I feel the real reason for this book's success is in the quality of the writing. Without 'dumbing down' Rubenstein has managed to communicate a substantial amount of information and argument in a compelling, almost novel-like journalistic narrative. This ability to communicate complex ideas and events is where the book really earns its five stars. A third reason why this book has struck a cord is that it fills a void in terms of human treatment of the Arian-Athanasian controversy. Classic historians of dogma such as Harnack concentrate on the ideas to the exclusion of the personalities - which has its place, but not to the point where key events such as Athanasius' murder of Arius by poisoning are ignored (as in some histories of doctrine). Not here - Rubenstein treats the doctrinal battles through the people who fought them.<br />A supplementary reading list in this area would include:<BR>--- Patristic source material:<BR>[1] Rusch W.G. The Trinitarian Controversy (reader) ****<BR>[2] Rusch W.G. The Christological Controversy (reader) ****<BR>--- Orthodox apologia for the Trinity:<BR>[3] Dunn J.D.

It will be obvious to most readers familiar with Jewish background to the New Testament that the NT devil comes virtually out of the blue. One can point to only two significant Satans in the whole OT (Job's and Zechariah's - one poetic, one prophetic) and then suddenly in the NT there is an explosion in diabolic activity from page 1 (35 mentions of \\"devil\\", 35 of \\"Satan\\", plus various synonyms such as \\"prince of this world\\"). Yet one searches in vain for anything in the Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha and Dead Sea Scrolls that prefigures the NT devil.<br />Why? This is the $64,000 question. But Russell doesn't address it - he allows his own personal faith in an everpresent fallen angel (from Eden?) to buck the issue that puzzles everyone confronted with the sudden upgrade of the devil in early Christianity, and what we get is a pedestrian walk through of early Christian devil belief without even attempting to explain this radical departure both from the Old Testament and also contemporary Judaism. Nor does Russell explore Paul's equally radical concept of the Old Man versus the New Man as a spiritual battle. If this isn't relevant to the NT devil, what is?	2002-06-14

Anyone wanting to know about Elizabeth Clare Prophet, her Church Universal Triumphant, and the Summit Lighthouse organization can very easily search for her own web pages on the net and form their own judgement. <br />One thing you will not find in this book is a cogent examination of 'Why church fathers supressed the book of Enoch'. To write on such a subject one would have to know something about the formation of the Hebrew canon - an area in which Ms. Prophet clearly has not even taken the trouble to read the standard texts (such as Leiman, Wurthwein and Tov), and then on patristics (where R.H. Charles gives a decent summary of Origen, Jerome and other fathers' views on Enoch). <br />However, on the positive side, for those who are looking for a copy of the Book of Enoch, some alternative suggestions:<br />If you are looking for a general read about all the various traditions about the Enoch mentioned in Genesis and then taken up by various Jewish, Christian and Muslim writers since, the book for you is probably 'Enoch A Man for All Generations' by the eminent professor James Vanderkam, chairman of the Society for Biblical Literature.<br />If you are looking for a scholarly and accurate translation of the original text of Book of Enoch as quoted in Jude 14, then the book for you is either the 1912 translation by R.H. Charles published (still) by SPCK, or the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Volume 1 ed. J.H. Charlesworth, and published by Doubleday 1983. Avoid the elderly 1821 translation by Rev. Richard Laurence if possible. If the SPCK version is out of print, there seem to be  various 'reproduction' copies available from American New Age publishing houses.<br />If you are looking for what the NT writers thought of the so-called 'Book of Enoch' read Luke 20:35-36, Titus 1:14, Heb 1:14, 2Pe. 2:16-20,3:3,3:10-12, Jude 8, and compare Jude 14 with 1En1:9 and Deut 33:2. (But you might still need a copy of Enoch to understand what Peter and Jude were getting so upset about).<br />If you are looking for sensationalist stories about fallen angels then you probably will get more out of the vampire fiction of Anne Rice...	2002-06-11

Fanter's editorial comments, again we have the work of an Enoch enthusiast. He believes the book is by the real Genesis Enoch and wants you to as well. Fair enough, each to his own, but in his handling of the relationship of the New Testament writers (primarily 2Peter and Jude obviously) Rev. Fanter follows the well beaten path of assuming - without so much as half a paragraph of justification - that if those writers made any reference to an apocryphal book they therefore \\"must\\" have regarded it as \\"inspired\\", ignoring both the immediate context of the Peter and Jude's references to the book, and also other NT context such as Paul's warning about \\"not giving heed to Jewish fables\\". Given that the two Enoch books are the grand daddy of all \\"Jewish fables\\" (to quote Titus 1:14, cf. 2 Peter 1:16,2:3), is it likely that Paul would be trashing this kind of material on one hand while his supporter Peter (cf. 2 Peter 2:15) was promoting it?<br />Rev. Fanter also skirts round Jesus' comment on the \\"Sons of God\\" tradition in Matthew 22:30 (cf. Luke 20:35-36). Enoch says 200 angels married, Jesus says angels don't marry - not exactly the evidence in favour of acceptance of Enoch in the early church that Rev. Fanter claims.<br />In sum, the intro to the texts is a bit of an affront to the reprinted texts of genuine pioneering Edwardian scholars Charles and Morfill. Go for an only marginally more expensive modern edition instead.	2002-04-25

US	52916331	R1P9KS9D78JZZ1	087579047X	714431955	The collected works of Hugh Nibley: Enoch the prophet, Volume 2	Books	3	8	17	N	N	Interesting insight into a debate among Mormons	Not being a member of the the Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) I find myself a little at sea with this material, but for an outsider the book does present some interest in that Nibley is a respected Mormon scholar who advocates that the Book of Mormon (Hellaman 13:33) quotes Book of Enoch. As such Nibley is one of the main points of reference for the many members of LDS who respect the Book of Enoch. However in reading outside this book one finds that other Mormon scholars (notably Kent Jackson of BYU) reject both the Book of Enoch and Nibley's arguments.<br />As to the book itself, it is probably of very limited utility to anyone with an interest in pseudepigrapha - anyone wanting to know about Enoch outside the LDS context would go to an academic writer (Nickelsburg, Vanderkam) or editor (Charlesworth) - but it does shed light on why some Mormons consider Book of Enoch semi-inspired. Personally I find Nibley's evidence for traces of Enoch in the book of Mormon extremely weak - nothing more than a very vague similarity. The first translation in English of 1Enoch, by Richard Laurence, was published in 1821 but was not widely available in America - and appears not to have been known to early Mormons.	2002-04-25

Presumably the same myth and magic elements that gave it such a following among 2nd temple Judaism. Enoch originated about 300BC, and the oldest copies, dating back to about 150BC are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran.<br />The best modern translations are to be found in the G. Vermes or Martinez editions of the Scrolls, or in the J. Charlesworth OT Pseudepigrapha set from Doubleday. A facsimile edition of R.H. Charles' 1912 translation is also worth obtaining for the copious notes. This translation by Laurence is not in the same category.<br />Despite all the enthusiasm that surrounds this book it is worth remembering that it has always been contested. Trypho the Jew, the Talmud, Pseudo-Philo, all the Rabbis prior to the 8th Century, St. Augustine, St. Jerome were only a few to contest the midrash interpretation of &quot;Sons of God&quot; of Gen6:2 as angels. The book was rejected from the Jewish canon, the Septuagint and Vulgate, and consequently the Apocrypha. After 400AD it was preserved only in minority Ethiopian and Slavonic traditions.<br />It is often noted that Jude quotes from this book, which is true - although with obvious sarcasm as the context shows; Jude's epithet &quot;the seventh from Adam&quot; is taken from Enoch60:8 not Genesis. Tertullian did quote from it and consider it as scripture, along with various other pseudepigraphical and apocryphal literature. It is also true that Peter gets his details regarding the &quot;angels that sinned&quot; being cast into Tartarus from Enoch. As also is indicated by the mentions of &quot;myths&quot; and &quot;cunningly devised fables&quot; with which Peter precedes it. &quot;Abraham's bosom&quot; in Luke 16, however is not drawn from Enoch but from the beliefs of the Pharisees recorded in Jewish burial papyri and various pre-Rabbinical myths. Given that the central figure in Luke16:19-30 is none other than Caiaphas (who else do we know ofin AD30 Jerusalem who had 5 brothers?) it is obvious that there is heavy irony in this reference.<br />Although it is occasionally claimed that there is nothing in Enoch that contradicts the Bible, 2Peter2 states quite clearly that &quot;angels do not accuse such beings&quot; - a blunt contradiction of 1Enoch10 where Michael Gabriel Uriel and Raphael do exactly that, accusing the mythical rebel angels. This is confirmed by Jude who even names Michael in his parallel rebuttal of 1Enoch. Further Christ states that Angels do not marry. Given that the only reference in the entire body of early Jewish literature to Angels marrying is the Enoch myth, this can only be a contradiction of 1Enoch.<br />In other words the writers of the New Testament knew about this book and rejected it. It is still interesting however to see what Peter and Jude's opponents were teaching.	2001-06-19

While the phrase &quot;body of Moses&quot; does suggest a connection with Jewish Testamental literature, the surviving Christian evidence is very flimsy. I certainly am not convinced by the verbal evidence that the Byzantine Palaea Historica is independant of Jude 9. Likewise all the other Christian evidence which features Michael telling the devil &quot;may the Lord rebuke you&quot; is most obviously explained as an attempt to explain Jude rather than a credible independent source. If Jude's aim was to use Zech3:1 to contradict the &quot;false teaching&quot; of 1En.9:1 then no further source is required. Also anyone reading Bauckham would think that the Christian evidence was a perfect fit for the missing ending of Jewish Testament of Moses, when it is clearly a different genre of pseudepigraphic literature.<br />   The second example is the dating. All commentaries assume Jude predates 2Peter, but the evidence is highly circumstantial. Whether one thinks Jude is pseudonymous is irrelevant, the differing Greek tenses used in the two books (&quot;will be&quot; 2Pe2:1 vs. &quot;have slipped in&quot; Jude 4) clearly imply that either the *(genuine or pseudonymous) author of Jude intended his readers to consider it the later letter, or the author of 2Peter intended it to be consider the earlier letter. And so what if Jude's quote of 2Pe 3:3 is not verbatim. How many NT quotes of the OT are verbatim? <br />A third example is p.93 where faced with the dative TOUTOIS (prophesied to them) Bauckham says &quot;this use of the dative is odd but must bear this meaning [prophesied about them]&quot;. Oh really? If one searches the Berkeley TLG CD-Rom, which contains most extant Greek texts, and count the examples of prophesy + dative meaning 'prophesy about' it becomes clear that if Jude had meant 'about them' he would have written PERI TOUTWN, and not TOUTOIS. It makes much better sense both in the context of the legendary Enoch prophesying to the Fallen Stars, and in the context of Book-of-Enoch prophesying to someone other than Jude's audience, and it respects the grammar of the Greek. It is only &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;must bear this meaning&quot; if one has already decided that Jude &quot;must&quot; feel positive towards 1Enoch.<br />The above three examples may sound like niggling, but repeat them several dozen times over in the course of the book and you can't help wishing there was more rigour in testing the received wisdom.<br />Otherwise it's still the best commentary on 2Peter and Jude.	2000-10-28

Although Vanderkam's treatment of both canonical and non-canonical books on the same dispassionate basis may bother some Christian readers, most of the book concerns unfamiliar material with which a bit of objectivity does not come amiss.<br />The only reservation I have is that both here and in his chapter on Enoch in 'The Jewish Apocalyptic Heritage in Christianity' mention is made of the quotes of 1Enoch (i.e. Ethiopic Enoch) found in 2Peter and Jude without any critical analysis of why the writers make these references. And on p.171  the common mistake of all translators of Jude 14 from Luther onwards &quot;Enoch prophesied about these men&quot; is repeated when all the Greek manuscripts clearly say &quot;Enoch prophesied to these men&quot;. The difference between &quot;about&quot; and &quot;to&quot; may not seem important if one believes, as Luther did, that the Enoch being referred to was the Enoch of Genesis, but if the Enoch being referred to is the book (as the origin of &quot;the seventh from Adam&quot; in 1En.60:8 confirms) that implies that Jude did not identify his audience with the audience of 1Enoch. It seems like a small mistake but as Jude 14 is the primary NT quote of 1Enoch, this is not the place to allow a basic grammatical error to skew one's approach. More generally it shouldn't just be assumed without question that every reference to Jewish legends in the New Testament is a positive reference. The NT writers were as capable of both negative and positive reference as any writer today. On occasion Dr. Vanderkam appears to be doing the authors of 2Peter and Jude the injustice of automatically assuming that they were as gullible as some people today.	2000-10-28

Brown falls into the third category, about which there is nothing wrong in itself. After all, everyone is entitled to accept or not accept the authority of ancient texts and traditions, and the sections of 1Enoch found among the Dead Sea Scrolls prove that this tradition is older than the Christian New Testament. The Coptic Orthodox Church in Ethiopia has long accepted 1Enoch as part of their canon, and during the 19th Century as translations of Ethiopic 1Enoch appeared in English many American denominations have made some use of Enoch traditions.<br />However if one is going to present &quot;Enoch: A Cross-Reference Exegesis of the Holy Bible&quot; there should be critical analysis of the texts so &quot;cross-referenced&quot;.  <br />For example it is not enough to point out that Jude 9 is related to 1Enoch 9, one should also ask how and why. In 1Enoch 9 Michael accuses the leader of the rebel angels, but in Jude 9 the writer, using material drawn from Zechariah 3, contradicts this and says Michael would not even rebuke. The same goes for the other quotes of 1Enoch in Jude. <br />Another example : anyone can see that there is a correspondence between &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;sons of God&quot; in Luke 20:36 and the angels marrying in 1Enoch 1, but we need to ask this: Is Jesus agreeing with 1Enoch or disagreeing?<br />I'm sorry but anyone wanting a book about Enoch would be much better served by 'Enoch : A Man for All Generations' (Studies on Personalities of the Old Testament) written the head of Hebrew at University of Notre Dame, James C. Vanderkam.	2000-10-28

My only two reservations concern the non-availability of a paperback version (a reasonable consideration if one wanted to buy the whole JPS series on a  limited budget), and, perhaps more importantly, the relative lack of  specifically Jewish perspective. I couldn't distinguish a lot of the  comments from what you might find in more rigorous detail in the Anchor or  Word commentaries (two scholarly Christian series with a tendancy to  higherish criticism). This is particularly noticeable in the pre-Abrahamic  section of the book where the commentary is influenced more by modern views  on the relation of Genesis to Canaanite myth than by traditional reverence  for the text. This is obviously a question of personal preference but I  find myself making more use of, and getting more from, Hertz's Pentateuch  and Haftorahs. There is not much here in Sarna's Genesis that is not also  found in Ephraim Speiser's (Anchor) or George Wenham's (Word).	2000-07-15

There is no evidence that 2 Enoch, or &quot;Slavonic  Enoch&quot; had any direct influence on Origen, Iranaeus or NT writers  (Jude, 2Peter, Luke 20 etc.) that distinction goes to 1 Enoch, or  &quot;Ethiopian Enoch&quot;, most of which is also found among the Dead Sea  Scrolls, which Slavonic Enoch is not.	2000-02-02

Presumably the same myth and magic elements that gave it such a following among 2nd temple Judaism. Enoch originated about 300BC, and the oldest copies, dating  back to about 150BC are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran.<br />The  best modern translations are to be found in the G. Vermes or Martinez  editions of the Scrolls, or in the J. Charlesworth OT Pseudepigrapha set  from Doubleday. A facsimile edition of R.H. Charles' 1912 translation is  also worth obtaining for the copious notes. This translation by Laurence is  not in the same category.<br />Despite all the enthusiasm that surrounds this  book it is worth remembering that it has always been contested. Trypho the  Jew, the Talmud, Pseudo-Philo, all the Rabbis prior to the 8th Century, St.  Augustine, St. Jerome were only a few to contest the midrash interpretation  of &quot;Sons of God&quot; of Gen6:2 as angels. The book was rejected from  the Jewish canon, the Septuagint and Vulgate, and consequently the  Apocrypha. After 400AD it was preserved only in minority Ethiopian and  Slavonic traditions.<br />It is often noted that Jude quotes from this book,  which is true - although with obvious sarcasm as the context shows; Jude's  epithet &quot;the seventh from Adam&quot; is taken from Enoch60:8 not  Genesis. Tertullian did quote from it and consider it as scripture, along  with various other pseudepigraphical and apocryphal literature. It is also  true that Peter gets his details regarding the &quot;angels that  sinned&quot; being cast into Tartarus from Enoch. As also is indicated by  the mentions of &quot;myths&quot; and &quot;cunningly devised fables&quot;  with which Peter precedes it. &quot;Abraham's bosom&quot; in Luke 16,  however is not drawn from Enoch but from the beliefs of the Pharisees  recorded in Jewish burial papyri and various pre-Rabbinical myths. Given  that the central figure in Luke16:19-30 is none other than Caiaphas(who  else do we know of in AD30 Jerusalem who had 5 brothers?) it is obvious  that there is heavy irony in this reference.<br />Although it is occasionally  claimed that there is nothing in Enoch that contradicts the Bible, 2Peter2  states quite clearly that &quot;angels do not accuse such beings&quot; - a  blunt contradiction of 1Enoch10 where Michael Gabriel Uriel and Raphael do  exactly that, accusing the mythical rebel angels. This is confirmed by Jude  who even names Michael in his parallel rebuttal of 1Enoch. Further Christ  states that Angels do not marry. Given that the only reference in the  entire body of early Jewish literature to Angels marrying is the Enoch  myth, this can only be a contradiction of 1Enoch.<br />In other words the  writers of the New Testament knew about this book and rejected it. It is  still interesting however to see what Peter and Jude's opponents were  teaching.	1999-11-10

The reason was that the Book of Enoch is essentially not compatible with the Christian gospel. The core story of Enoch, apart from the myth about angels marrying  which is explicitly contradicted by Christ (&quot;and do not marry for they  are like unto the angels&quot;), there are many other conflict points with  the New Testament. The principle one being that Enoch functions as a  mediator, a role that 1Tim2:5 allows only for Christ.<br />One can also note  that the Enoch version of events where Michael accuses the rebel angels is  again explicitly contradicted by Peter (&quot;even angels do not accuse  such beings&quot;) and by Jude (who even names Michael as not accusing).  Maybe this is why it was not accepted by the church?<br />Enoch originated  about 300BC, and the oldest copies, dating back to about 150BC are found  among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran.

The movement is much more widespread in Britain, Australia, Canada, Africa and India. Although the movement in its modern form dates back to the 1850s Christadelphians point to groups with the same characteristic beliefs (pacifism, adult baptism, death being sleep, physical resurrection at the second coming, non-trinitarianism) going back to the Reformation. In theological terms they not fully Unitarian, but are Socinian, believing in the virgin birth, but not the literal preexistence of Jesus in heaven, nor any role for him in creating Adam and Eve. As regards the Bible text they are fundamentalist (rejecting all other authorities) and mainly literalist (the exception being the devil which is taken as an extended parable).<br />Given the absence of any formal hierarchy or leadership among Christadelphians, this book is as near as one can come to a 'representative' introduction to Christadelphian beliefs by a middle of the road Christadelphian. The author, a retired UK Civil Servant, is well known as a speaker and writer in the church, and has served on several of the informal preaching and publishing committees which characterise the movement.<br />Contents as follows:<br />PREFACE<BR>FOREWORD<BR>1.

There are a few things in Appendix 1 and Chapter 26 which some Christadelphians might debate, but by and large this is as representative and straightforward a description of Christadelphian belief as you will find.<br />Since this book is published in the UK it may occasionally be more easily obtained from Amazon.co.uk than in the US.<br />A search on Amazon.co.uk shows 94 other titles in print from the same publisher.

But don't expect variety among the contributors - as noted  &quot;all essayists accept the reality of the demonic&quot;. This is a  weakness.<br />One thing the conference seems to have lacked is  input from  Judaism to what are historically Jewish source materials (Old and New  Testament). This  would have been useful in considering both the Jewish  demon literature (such as Tobit and Solomon traditions) which is so  relevant to the NT, and also the basic contradiction between OT and NT on  this subject; i.e. the papers do not address how in Exodus Moses is told by  God that he causes deafness, blindness and dumbness, yet in the Synoptics  deafness, blindness, and dumbness are caused by demons. This is an issue  that demands historical input and more awareness of the original context of  demon possession within early Jewish beliefs on medicine and  suffering.<br />In sum, good source material, but by the very nature of  symposiums the papers concentrate on details rather than basic issues.	1999-07-20

Forbes has assembled a considerable amount of  material and argued the position cogently. <br />Some points however are a bit  stretched, as for example to argue that the &quot;dialects of angels&quot;  used in worship by women in charismatic Jewish congregations in Alexandria,  were substantially different from the &quot;tongues of angels&quot; used in  worship by women in charismatic Christian congregations in Corinth.  Especially when &quot;dialects&quot; is used by Luke to describe the  &quot;tongues&quot; at Pentecost.<br />Otherwise its fine. But be aware that  this is a study with an agenda to restore the role of prophecy in the  modern church (p.viii). For a representative of that 'consensus' view try  'Prophecy in Early Christianity and the Ancient Mediterranean World' by  David E. Aune.	1999-07-18

One example is describing Isaiah's falling Babylonian star from 700BC as \\"Lucifer\\" - terminology which originated with the Old Latin version and interpreters such as Origen. Even the title of this book \\"The Devil\\" (a Septuagint or New Testament term), is slightly out of place when \\"Satan\\" (a Hebrew and therefore Old Testament term) is the volume which follows it. That's an obvious example, examples within the text are less obvious - and more misleading.<br />The major complaint however is that Russell frequently lets his personal belief in fallen supernatural beings overflow into the text. Ch1 (p17-35) presenting in personal terms \\"The Question of Evil\\" is fair enough, but later on the reader is sometimes left wondering, is this a straightforward history book or personal theology?	1999-07-18

On the minus side, in this volume, as with the others, one is constantly uneasy that the historical perspective is being underpinned by the author's own belief in a literal fallen heavenly being, and too often it is not clear whether the focus is medieval society or metaphysics.<br />Incidentally, anyone buying this book because of the word 'Lucifer' in the title will be disappointed that Russell does not address how the specific concept of 'Lucifer' developed from Origen and Augustine onwards. Neither here, nor in the previous volume 'Satan', does Dr Russell deal in any depth with the process by which a name which for the first 4 centuries of Christianity was used as a title of Christ (because the Latin word Lucifer appears in the Latin Vulgate as Peter's \\"day star\\"), to the point that early Christians used to name their children Lucifer (eg Bishop Lucifer of Cagliari), suddenly by the 5th and 6th centuries was being used as a title for a fallen angel (based on Isaiah 14:12 being reapplied).	1999-07-18

The difference is in Ch2-3-4 which cover the 'good' angels which Arnold does not.<br />I also found Noll's footnoting better than Arnold's, as for example in 'The Snake in the Garden; Satan's disappearing act' (p.98-99) where he correctly footnotes the 1st Century BC 'Book of Wisdom' as the first book to identify the serpent as Satan. (It would have been even better had he mentioned that Paul, the only NT writer to directly discuss the temptation of Eve, clinically describes the serpent as \\"the serpent\\", but anyway..).<br />Reservations come in Noll's treatment of some of the OT history. For example Noll in Ch.5 (p.97-98) rejects the impact of Persian dualism on Hebrew thought. This seems to be done for theological reasons rather than historical. Compare a preexilic writer such as Isaiah's rejection of dualism \\"I form the light AND create darkness, I make peace AND create evil, I the Lord do all these things\\" with the dualistic view of postexilic books such as 1Enoch. With all respect to Noll, in this case the \\"widespread scholarly view\\" for once is correct; Judaism did shift from a more strictly monotheistic view of evil pre-exile to a dualist one post-exile.<br />Another reservation is in the dismissal of the generation of John Locke (1632-1704) as mere skeptics. While Locke himself unquestionably was a rationalist, others of that period such as Isaac Newton rejected fallen angels as a part of wider developments in non-conformist belief generated partly by Mennonite, Socinian and other influences from Europe.<br />This aside the book is well written and well referenced. It is  populist in it's approach and makes no bones about being written by someone who believes in both 'angels of light and powers of darkness' to an audience who believe the same. Occasionally this standpoint leads to selective presentation which causes a grin (such asclipping off the awkward word \\"all\\" from the beginning of Heb.1:14 on page 154) but on balance Noll does this a lot less than other writers on this subject.<br />I wish I could recommend a book for the alternative viewpoint (i.e. that all angels are good, the problem is with mankind) but either those books don't get written, or there isn't a market for them. Maybe Primo Levi's autobiographical novel 'If this is a man?' is that other side of the story?	1999-07-18

The second was the amount of  mistakes in the accent marking. Almost every page had one or two accent  errors. (It would be nice if the next reviewer could comment on whether the  accents are in the right place on, say, p240: predlagaet, Baikala,  kilometrovii, lovlya) <br />A third problem which will still be with the  revised edition is that Russian grammar cannot possibly be fully taught in  a beginners book. Anyone studying Russian also needs Wade's grammar and  either Pirogova's verb book or the &quot;501&quot; or &quot;750&quot;  Russian verbs books.

In his preface Mr Arnold comments that the Western church has failed to take seriously \\"the involvement of a figure named Satan and his powers of darkness\\" and cites the needs of his Asian, African and East European students. As such it is also conceived as an 'answer' to the modernist approach found in Walter Wink's 'Powers' books (i.e. 'Society is the devil').<br />Personally my main interest was in the first 5 chapters which purport to deal with \\"First Century Belief\\", but even here it soon became obvious that Arnold is only interested in cherry-picking from 1st Century evidence that agrees with his own beliefs in literal supernatural evil. <br />One particularly crass example of this is on p.61 (and again p.98) where he tries to press Isaiah's Lucifer into service as evidence for Satan's fall. This in itself might be forgiveable, but when he then goes on to claim that \\"this connection was certainly how early Jewish interpreters understood this passage\\" he passes the limit between being selective with the evidence and downright falsification. Always beware of commentators who say \\"certainly\\" and don't give any footnoted evidence. Which early Jewish interpreters saw Satan in Isaiah 14:14? Not Isaiah (14:16). Nor Josephus, nor Philo, not even the demon-packed Dead Sea Scrolls, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. Not Hillel or the early Rabbis. Not Peter who used the same Greek name for Jesus 'Morning Star'. Not the generations of Christians who following the Vulgate version of 1Peter named their children Lucifer. In fact no one, neither Jewish nor Christian, until Tertullian and Origen. And it is Tertullian and Origen who Arnold is following here - not \\"early Jewish interpreters\\".<br />So, in sum, this is a pretty standard book on evil angels, not much different from any others on the 'Spiritual Warfare' shelf at your local Christian bookstore. Which is fine. But Christian writers should resist the temptation to rewrite the Jewish evidence to fit their own variant of a belief in fallen angels.	1998-10-03

The earlier work (1982) is by two of the staff at London's  University's SOAS. The newer, by Ken Qian, seeks a less academic approach  and is clearly targetted more at the unaccompanied beginner. While the  publisher's decision to issue an easier and more 'popular' textbook is  understandable the old Tung and Pollard version is being kept in print due  to its popularity as a university text and the fact that the Chinese  character texts are available separately. If you want to really learn  Chinese to the level of being able to read newspapers and novels one day  then you'd be better off with Tung and Pollard.	1998-10-02

It does have a couple  of small drawbacks - firstly that the one page appendix of province names  at the back could have been expanded to list more than the capital town in  each and also foreign countries and cities, secondly that, yes, the text is  microscopic, but then if it wasn't you couldn't carry it in your pocket all  day. And finally, a third failing lamented by many is the lack of menu  Chinese; not even gongbao jiding (palace-fry chicken-cubes) gets a listing.  However the one great thing about this dictionary is that it is the only  pocket dictionary with both pinyin and characters. It also has a uniquely  sensible character indexing system.<br />For desk work the best medium sized  Chinese-English dictionary is Han-Ying Cidian by Waiyu Jiaoxue yu Yanjiu  Chubanshe, Beijing, (ISBN 7-5600-1325-2) which shares the little red book's  character index system, and the best English-Chinese is the giant Ying-Han  Dacidian or 'English-Chinese Dictionary Unabridged' edited by Lu Gusun  (Shanghai Yiwen Chubanshe (ISBN 7-5327-1321-0).<br />Non-English speakers note  that this dictionary is also available in French (Larousse), German  (Langenscheidt), and Japanese (Toho Shoten) versions, or in the  corresponding Shangwu Yinshuguan editions published in China.	1998-10-02

US	52916331	RKV2HOXFTM9QO	4900737135	899935535	Making Out in Chinese	Books	1	17	24	N	N	Amateurish	The first problem with this book is the lack of Chinese characters making  it virtually worthless for more advanced Chinese learners. Secondly the  romanisation is not pinyin, nor any other recognisable system. Thirdly this  should be entitled &quot;making out in Taiwanese&quot; as a good 20~30  percent of the phrases in the book would not be recognised by  mainlanders.<br />If you want a book on Chinese slang then get either 'Mutant  Mandarin' or 'Outrageous Chinese' by James Wang (China Books, San  Francisco) although these include a lot of liumang and Beijing punk slang  that doesn't travel well, or Li Shu Juan's 'Chinese-English Dictionary of  Modern Slang in China' (ISBN 962-238-222-3, Hong Kong) the only failing of  which is to not always distinguish Cantonese and Northern slang.	1998-10-02

Although it tackles a range of difficult Bible subjects it does so in a way  that steers clear of theological jargon and uses one Bible text to  illustrate another. Having been translated among other languages into  Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, Korean, Japanese, Tagalog and Telugu it would  be a shame if this were permanently unavailable in English. In sum it is  still well worth trying to order through Amazon.com as this is a unique and  valuable book.	1998-09-26
