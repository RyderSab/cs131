Here Newt, (for a rationalist) panders to the far right religious evangelical (nuts) who have corrupted Christianity for their own self-serving purposes. The Christain faith espoused by these loonies is ultimately wrong, self corrupting and full of theological (and commonsense) inconsistencies. <br /> <br />Enough of this mumbo jumbo, and keep the state and religion separate!!	2005-03-09

Michael Moore has written a very topical and at times thought provoking book. <br />I can't say I always agree with him, but it is important to have people like Moore floating about on the political landscape pricking political hypocrisy and egos.<br />A lot of what Moore covers isn't all that new, and in some ways is addressed in greater detail by other writers. <br />Moore is a popularist. And there is nothing wrong with that. He has been successful in making people aware of issues, and brings to light important questions.<br />This book doesn't answer any of the questions that Moore sets out to ask. That's a pity. It's important to ask questions, but equally important to set out some answers, if not interpretations and assessments of what the answers may be. Moore makes a great deal of the use of implication and supposition. While entertaining, it makes his argument and assertions arguably as superficial as those made by the political establishment he is enthusiastically fighting.<br />Nonetheless a good read.	2003-10-13

He recounts his experiences at the 1974 World Cup, his adventures as player and captain of the national team, and of his life as a semi-professional in the NSW soccer league.<br />Warren also casts judgment on the history and state of the game in Australia. For the most part his assessment is exact. <br />Overall, the biography doesn't delve at any length about Warren's personal life, or to any great extent about the personal battles, arguments, tensions that he experienced throughout the course of his career. Warren appears to colour in his life like colouring in the dots.<br />The account is simply an overview of experiences, without any great depth.<br />An annoying feature is that the last few chapters of the book were clearly written by Andy Harper. The annoyance rests no in that Harper wrote the chapters, for the analysis is quite thorough, but rather that the style, syntax, vocabulary so clearly contrasts with the style of the earlier chapters that the reader is left feeling that he is reading two different books, together with the fact that the reader is left wondering what happened to Warren's `voice' which was loud and clear in the first half of the book.	2003-08-01

It is clearly not that simple to condense highly complex mathematical equations, and concepts of and about quantum physics to a level that the ordinary person will not only grasp but perhaps think about.<br />The book is effectively divided into two parts. The first is a synopsis of the theories underpinning time travel. In this section Davies provides a speedy overview of the history of thinking about time travel, the development of the theories, and he attempts to at least conceptually work through the possibilities and problems associated with the main theories that hold currency.<br />In the second part, Davies sets out the mechanics of how to build a time machine. The content contained in is part, not matter how hard Davies tries, and despite its brevity, was very difficult for this reader to understand. Having no background in pure physics, I became a bit lost in places. But struggling through out, it is still informative and challenging.<br />Overall, the book is a valuable starting point for the general person to get a grip on this though provoking topic.	2003-05-30

Did we need another? <br />The lives and times of American Presidents always make interesting reading. The US has been blessed with some great men who have held the top job. And even the less than great deserve some sort of attention, because getting to be president is often a life long journey in itself.<br />My particular favourites are Lincoln, FDR, JFK, and Nixon, and in recent times I have spent more and more time trying to get a grip on Truman, LBJ whom has probably not received the due credit he deserved, and Clinton, who is probably getting all the wrong sort of attention.<br />Back to this biography. JFK's life reads like a \\"Boys Own Annual\\" - wealth, adventure, girls, fame, political intrigue, and political sophistication.<br />This biography joins all the dots, covers all the salient points in the man's life, and makes the usual historical assumptions, and determinations. <br />Is it any better or worse, or any more necessary than other works? In my opinion it sits somewhere in the middle. It's probably a good place to start if you have not read anything else. At the end of the day, the beginning is usually a good place to start.	2003-05-13

It is no different with this collection. <br />Ultimately, determining the good and the bad is dependent on personal choice. I found the majority of the essays to be rather dull, and uninspiring. Hornby's piece was probably typical. <br />However there were three essays that made the experience pleasurable, as they described the highs and lows of the season, the love and hate of following a club and being a ardent club supporter, and the drama that overlays it all.<br />The central premise of putting together a collection of authors to write about a season in the history of their club, and from the fans perspective, is to be applauded. But somehow, the expectation and the output never quite meet.	2003-03-18

It is about soccer/football, but it is so much more. As an account of a small town football club it is a riveting read. But the book is so much more. Football is virtually the background scenario. There is more to be enjoyed from a wide range of characters and personalities that inhabit the town and the football club, and how they deal with all the various pressures.	2003-03-18

While his previous works were superb, ranging from travel books, to three well executed thriller-page turners, Pursuit represents an ambitious advance. <br />The plot centers on a relationship based in the Marcarthyist period in the US, and the principal location is New York.<br />Having only just visited New York for the first time, I greatly enjoyed Kennedy's description of NYC main streets and avenues that I had only just visited weeks before.<br />The advance for Kennedy comes in his greater scope of plot and storyline, and even his greater self confidence as a novelist. He manages to very competently convey the issues, concerns and emotions of his main character, a woman in 1950's America.	2003-02-18

I would have thought that there would have been many other more notable and capable historians to whom the publishers could have turned.<br />The series is deliberately designed to present deliberately short biographies of famous figures. Always a tough job and the decision tree of what to exclude, and in turn what to include would be very difficult.<br />Lincoln was a very complex character, complete with faults, but also stunning personal gifts. His life was full of failure, up until the time he became president, when he found his true calling, and skill sets.<br />Keneally tries to paint a picture of Lincoln that really doesn't grab the reader. It's not a bad effort, but neither does it grab the opportunity that this form of biography allows, particularly to people who are looking for an entry point into Lincoln, but don't want to (as yet) tackle a many hundred page biography.<br />A fair effort.	2003-01-29

And sure you have to suspend disbelief occassionally to make the plot work - but what's the harm with that? I enjoyed this book.

At the time I thought it was entertaining, and insightful, especially as it came on the back of the devolution of the Soviet Union.<br />Since its publication, this book has been subject to considerable debate by both adherents and opponents. The book proposes that the liberal democratic system operating a capitalist system is the end point of political history - ie that mankind has settled on a system of government that provides the best approach to regulating human affairs. Given the failure of communism, the failure of dictatorships (of the left and the right), I think this thesis holds true.<br />What opponents of the book/argument don't understand is that the author (I believe) is not suggesting that liberal democracy is not without its flaws, and occasionally will generate significant governance problems. (Take the seriously flawed Florida election ballot counting process in the Bush vs Gore US Federal Presidential election.) But what the thesis suggests is that the system is signficantly robust to work through problems, and deliver benefits on the other side. This ability to hande internal political problems without course to violence or repression is not a trait readily found in other political systems.<br />Fukuayma gets 'beaten' up too often for just suggesting that liberal democracy overall is a good thing, that it works, and it has succeeded other political systems because it works and people overall like it. Opponents of this thesis ought to remember that only in liberal democratic systems can opponents of the prevailing political status quo argue for its change or abolition. Try doing that when subejct to a dictatorship!	2002-10-02

The future of automobile production, and general supply chain management is centred in lean production philosophies and management techniques.<br />This book provides for the initiated, as well as the practitioner, a complete account of the major issues and problems faced with the introduction and management of lean systems.<br />The Japanese, particularly Toyota, were the originators of this approach to manufacturing. The Japanese success has been closely followed throughout the world, with the Koreans modelling the technique, and US companies such as the GM Saturn closely resembling lean systems.<br />The manufacturing and retail supply chain management in automobiles, but also in every other sector of economic activity, is closely following lean systems. This book is a very useful and immediate account of what this important production development and technique exactly is.	2001-03-16

Orwell writes succinctly, openly, and without any emotive fluff. Orwell lets the situations, and the descriptions of poverty and the terrible workplace conditions speak for themselves. A perfect, lively account of the events Orwell lived through, and for that has more meaning than simply a neutral social history account.	2001-02-18

Palin touches on issues about government privatisation, and economic rationalism, and corporate greed, set in rural England in the 90s. A pleasant account of a little guy against some corporate thugs. There isn't too much humour, but neither is the book a heavy political tract. The major personality theme of Hemmingway seems to get lost sometimes, and is an occasional distraction from the main story, but Palin makes a good attempt to bring the two together.	2001-02-18

As surprising as it may be, this book quickly moves off Dan Quayle and all his idiosyncracies, and concentrates on a satirical/humourous account of the office of the Vice President. And it is intersting from an academic point of view, but also in the various curiosities that Queenan points out, for eg, that Indiana holds the record for the number of VPs of any US state. I thoroughtly recommend this book, as an introduction to a US political office that has received scant political attention - when it should be just as important - especailly during the election cyncial - as to who is the rtunning mate and what qualifications etc they have should the president no longer able to fulfill their position.	2001-02-12

It attempted to discuss/analyse the social and poltiical mores of Australia, and tried to provide a critique of what was then 'good' and 'bad'. Having read the book recently, it surprised me how this pamphlet could have caused the fuss it did. Perhaps as the sequel to THE LUCKY COUNTRY, and given the title the hype preceeded it a little. Worth a read for hisotoricval context, but not much more.	2001-01-09

It covers all the usual, his life, childhood, moves into politics, and career on the front bench. But its all written in a colour by numbers style, which made the reading very dry. The lack of clear analysis of politics he worked in, or of the personalities he encounted was the greatest disapointment.	2001-01-09

The attention was fueled by Richardson's political career as a fixer, shaker and head kicker. There was prmise that the book would 'reveal all'. However, the hype was just that hype. Richardson joins the dots on his career, and mentions all the right names and his contact withthem. There certainly wasn't anything controversial in the book. Oh, Richardson does admit that politicians do occasionally lie. I think that was obvious.	2001-01-09

The decision tree alone of what information to include/exclude would be a significant problem. <br />Braudel's thesis is that religion, culture and geography, together with traditional tools of history are all important in understanding civilizations. This is a true and accurate perspective. <br />He concentrates on Nth America, Europe, Asia, Islam and Africa. His chapter on Islam, and the first civilization studied, was outstanding and certainly he was able to tie in his thesis to this examination. However, I got the impression he got lazy, and ended up providing cobbled sketches of the other civilizations, and concentrating more on history than analysis. Hence why Great to good.	1999-02-05
