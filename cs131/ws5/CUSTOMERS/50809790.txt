I had seen this book in the bookstore, but I had resisted buying it because it doesn't use the Spanish articles.  However, after my niece kept repeating the 10-15 Spanish words she learned at school and from watching Dora the Explorer, I realized that this book would be great for her (and my sister/her mom who doesn't speak any Spanish).  The first time I read it to her, she repeated every verse back to me--on her own, I did not ask her to do it.  I think this will help her learn quite a few more Spanish words.	2005-04-26

The rhymes are reminiscent of the true Seussian style as are the characters in the book. <br /> <br />The topics this book covers are: exercise, germs, washing, food pyramid, drinking water, brushing your teeth, wearing helmets and getting enough sleep.	2004-11-12

The rhyming style is excellent.  This book introduces such concepts as four levels of the rain forest, transpiration, animals in the forest, pollination, and camouflage.	2004-10-25

It is a great book for the very young child.  Each page has a true photo of a different animal and three facts about the animal.  The animals are: dog, cat, bird, rabbit, mouse, ladybug, duck, and frog.	2004-10-25

While it is factual, the rhyming is sloppy--in one stanza a word is rhymed with itself and in another stanza, the word from the beginning of the next phrase is placed at the end of another phrase so that the stanza will rhyme.  All in all, this type of sloppy rhyming is extremely disappointing coming from the \\"Cat in the Hat\\"!	2004-10-25
US	50809790	R2J9UDN4882MJB	0786818425	256371302	Baby Einstein: Nature Discovery Cards: Nature Photographs and Animal Facts to Delight Your Baby	Books	2	37	41	N	N	Random sampling of nature pictures/vocabulary	According to the Parent's Guide, these cards can be grouped into earth, water and sky.  It is marketed for ages 9 months and up, and it seems some of the concepts would be difficult for a child that young to grasp, e.g. wetlands, wave, and comet.  Also, I am not sure how you could explain to a very small child the difference between the \\"water\\" card and the \\"ocean\\" card (and possibly the \\"sand\\" card and \\"beach\\" card which is an aerial view). <br /> <br />The card for \\"sun\\" does not look like the sun a child would be familiar with in the sky and may be confused with the \\"sunset\\" card.  Also, you will have to make the distinction between \\"sky\\" and \\"clouds,\\" as well as \\"earth\\" and \\"planet.\\" <br /> <br />The remaining cards are rocks, rainbow, moon, stars, sea jellies, fish, soil, flower, mountain, coral, sea star, crab, shell, grass, tree, and leaf.	2004-10-25

I had been looking for books that would introduce science concepts to children under 4, and thankfully, this series does it.  I do not think all of the books are equal with their rhyming style, but this is one of the best ones.  This book introduces each of the planets, some constellations, the moon and the sun.	2004-10-25

In this book, the rhymes are crisp and interesting.  Some of the concepts introduced/covered include: meteorologists, weather maps, clouds, evaporation, condensation, snow, rain, thunder, lightning, tornadoes, and climatology.  This book covers a lot in the simple and effective Cat in the Hat style.	2004-10-25

I bought this set of books for my 3-year-old niece who is \\"princess obsessed.\\"  I like this set because it deals with practical \\"kindness\\" lessons.  There are 6 books.  The titles are: <br /> <br />Snow White Makes a Change <br />Sleeping Beauty Shares <br />Cinderella's Good Manners <br />Ariel Learns a Lesson <br />Jasmine's Gift <br />Belle Helps Out	2004-10-20

I thought it would be similar to other children's cookbooks with colorful pictures and detailed explanations--it has neither.  While the idea of this cookbook is definitely a good one, this presentation is awful.  <br />Additionally, the first \\"recipe\\" is for Kool-Aid which this book says is a good drink.  Personally, I find Kool-Aid lacking in nutritional value.  Also in the beverage section is a recipe for \\"Adult\\" eggnog which includes alcoholic beverages.  I hardly think this is an appropriate recipe for a children's cookbook.	2003-10-29

(English and Spanish Edition)	Books	1	2	4	N	N	Attention not paid to Spanish language detail	This book is advertised as a beginner reader book for English and Spanish.  However, while the English is on the beginner level, the Spanish is not for beginners.  Additionally, the list of vocabulary words in the back includes some of the nouns WITHOUT the articles.  There is no pronunciation guide.  I believe that the Barron's I Can Read Spanish Language Learning Series is much better for the beginning English/Spanish reader.	2003-09-23

Like the other books in the \\"My First Spanish...Board Book\\" series, this one is excellent.  It includes vocabulary for house decorations (garland, candles, wreath, etc.), tree decorations, Christmas plants, stable animals, Christmas presents (toys), and many other theme items.

This book should also be marketed as a bilingual book because the English and Spanish vocabulary words are included.  I like most of the Baby Einstein books, and this is one of their best.  The photographs of objects are bold and colorful and the layout of the book--with similar subjects presented together (e.g. \\"occupations,\\" \\"parts of the body\\") is excellent.  Honestly, the book cover does not do this book justice.  This book can be enjoyed by all ages.	2003-09-16

It lists items on the farm, some farm animals including their parts of body, farm vehicles, fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products.  One of the best things about this book is that it is bilingual--the vocabulary is offered in both English and Spanish.  I hope that DK continues to purchase bilingual versions of their \\"My First Board Book\\" series.  They are great vocabulary builders.	2003-09-12

My issue with this book is not the actual counting in Kiswahili, but that the other books in this series are countries and not continents.  This book could misinform a child that Africa is one large homogeneous group, and not made up of many different countries as well as cultures.	2003-09-10

Instead, the animals are the stuffed creations from the videos and not photos of real animals at all.  I thought this was very disappointing, especially since I loved the concept of the different languages on the cards.  I think this set is only useful when used with the videos.	2003-09-03

I love these cards!  The pictures are great and the information on the back is wonderful.  I only wish that the author had put the names of the animals in different languages as she did on the Language Discovery Cards.  One small point, I am not sure why she has some broad category animals, such as \\"dog\\" and then more specific ones, such as a particular type of fish.	2003-09-03

I think, however, that the age range is a bit wrong.  I think that this book can be enjoyed as early as 2 years of age, when a child is learning the objects around them.

If I were to break my rule, this would have been the book that done it.  My fiance' purchased this book for me from the author at a book signing.  I had no idea the book was going to be so poorly written.  I don't think Ms. Breaux is of the same league as Toni Morrison or Gloria Naylor at all.  I thought the plot concept was poorly conceived and developed.  I was surprised to find that other readers gave this book such high reviews.	2002-07-30
