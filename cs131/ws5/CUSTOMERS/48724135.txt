With the focus on technique, I found that this book was really easy to follow along with my own pictures.  There is very little Photoshop-ish \\"select Tool X, click here, then use Tool Y and click there\\" language in the book.  As another reviewer pointed out, even if you're using other image manipulation applications such as GIMP, Paint Shop Pro, etc, the techniques still apply.  That said, some of it is Photoshop-specific and all the example are taken using Photoshop CS2 on the Mac.<br /><br />Personally, I really liked the sections on changing image colors - which I find myself doing (or wanting to do) a lot lately.  A lot of what I discovered while reading this book centers around \\"retouching is subtle\\".<br /><br />If you are considering making a career or a profitable hobby out of photo retouching, I would highly recommend this book.  Along with the techniques, it also contains advice from the author on professional retouching as well as information on preparing images for newsprint and other printed media.  While I won't be sending any pictures to the professional print media any time soon, I will definitely be using this book as a guide for retouching my own photographs.	2005-09-02

However, none are easy to take on a hike (for example).  This book easily fits in my camera bag serves as my \\"cheat sheet\\" when I'm away from the house taking pictures.<br /><br />It contains all the basic information you'd expect.  Explanation of terms, what all the camera features do, suggestions for shots, etc.  I really liked the third section which contains the information on how to set up and take the best shots possible.  I would have been happy with another 50 pages on taking pictures in various locations and lighting conditions.  The pages are all full color as well - I have the Third Edition.	2005-09-02

It was pretty good, but I thought some of the degunking advice/suggestions/techniques were a bit odd.  I gave the book to a non-technical family member, who loved it.  She passed it on to another family member who also loved it.  I lost track of it after that.<br /><br />So, looking at the book through a non-technical lens, this is a great book to help keep your Mac up and running smoothly.  There is lots of good advice around the various features and applications you would normally use.  For example; How to keep email spam to a minimum; How to find extra disk space if you're running low; How to keep the Dashboard cleaned up.  This book also serves as a great way to explore and understand the various features provided by your Mac and the included applications.  It also suggests quite a few 3rd party applications (free or relatively inexpensive) to assist you with the \\"degunking\\" tasks.<br /><br />I guess to sum it up; this isn't exactly for the Slashdot crowd.  However, if you're a new Mac user, a home user, or a non-technical user (i.e. no one politely refers to you as a computer geek) this should at least be on your \\"flip-through-it-at-the-book-store\\" list.  For me, I will be sending it off to a family member.  Based on prior experience, they're going to love it.	2005-08-21

The rest of the book is essentially the same, with minor updates and corrections scattered throughout.<br /><br />As with the previous book (which I also have - and reviewed), I really appreciated the sidebars and \\"Pearls of Wisdom\\" scattered throughout the text. In these, the author gives quick insights like; why one tool works better than another or a keystroke reminder or a technical definition.  Each tutorial is broken up into easy to follow steps.<br /><br />With the included DVD-ROM, you get visual tutorials and a \\"set up your Photoshop like Deke\\" option (which you can skip).  I tried the \\"setup like Deke\\" option and the install hung, so I had to kill it and run the install again, skipping this part.  It think it would be nice for the next version to actually be a DVD playable on your computer or regular DVD player.<br /><br />Definitely a great book to have.  My only caution would be if you already have the previous edition (or haven't upgraded to Photoshop CS2 yet), there isn't a whole lot that's different.<br /><br />[ NOTE: I was contacted by the author about the install issue.  He had a Total Training developer contact me and resolve the issue.  It had to do with my copy of Photoshop CS2 not being installed in the default location.  I am now \\"setup like Deke.\\" :) ]	2005-08-17

Well, ok - probably still a lot of things you can't do with Swing.  This book goes through a lot of different techniques and \\"hacks\\" that make that list a lot smaller than you might think.  Like all the \\"Hacks\\" titles I've read, there were some hacks I liked and some I didn't.  However, unlike other Hacks books, this one had a whole lot more that fell in the \\"liked\\" category.  There are an unexpected (but much appreciated!) number of hacks for Swing development on Mac OS X.  How to create OS X style sheets and the \\"earthquake\\" dialog, to name a couple.<br /><br />A really cool hack is #64 Turn the Spotlight on Swing.  This hack allows you to focus a \\"spotlight\\" on an area of your app.  This draws attention to a specific area of the open window by \\"dimming the lights\\" around it.<br /><br />Almost all the hacks have substance; there aren't any one-sentence \\"How to reboot you machine\\" hacks.  The chapter headings and hack titles  are pretty self descriptive, so a read through those should give you a pretty good idea if this book is something you would find useful.	2005-08-10

A few of my favorite parts of the book are the sidebars.  There is an occasional \\"Nostalgia Corner\\" sidebar which points out various \\"old way things were done\\" and the \\"new way things are done\\".  The \\"Gem in the Rough\\" sidebars explain potentially useful, but probably not obvious, features of OS X.  There are also \\"Power User Clinic\\" sidebars for the true OS X geeks.<br /><br />The book does go into the iLife apps at a high level, but if you're looking for details you should check out the separate iLife (iMovie & iDVD, iPhoto, GarageBand, etc) Missing Manual books.  For that matter, there are a lot of books that would do a better job getting into the nitty-gritty specifics of various applications or features (like AppleScript) of OS X - which is not the purpose of this book.  This is a high level introduction to just about everything OS X can do for you.<br /><br />If you're new - or relatively new - to OS X, this is definately a book I'd recommend.  I've loaned it to a few of my buddies (recent \\"converts\\" to the Mac) and they've all given it a thumbs up.  If you've done Cheetah, Puma, Jaguar, Panther and now Tiger - hmmm... it would be good for the new features (Spotlight, Dashboards, Automator, etc) but I wouldn't put it on my \\"must have\\" list.  Definately on the \\"nice to have\\" list, though.<br /><br />As always, the Mac is less work and more play (unless asked a direct question by spouse or boss, then it's all work and no play).  Anyway, for grins (or groans) turn on the Speech Recognition (Chapter 15) and ask your Mac \\"Tell me a joke\\".	2005-07-27

A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A great book to keep around	As you can probably infer from the other reviews, it's hard to find negatives about this book.  I like it because it's \\"short\\" (less than 200 pages) and doesn't waste the space with rambling tangents.  It's full of suggestions and \\"we've found that X works well\\" information, but doesn't get \\"preachy\\".  It's easy to read and avoids using big words and detailed theory just to show you how smart the authors are, which was appreciated.<br /><br />The overall tone I took from the book was, \\"Here's what we've found works, see if it works for you\\".  My favorite part was the chapter titled \\"Common Problems and How to Fix Them\\", in which I found a number of issues I could directly relate to.<br /><br />Fortunately, the project I'm working on embraces a lot of the practices described in this book already.  However, there's always room for improvement.  It's definately a book that will be passed around the group for review and feedback.	2005-07-22

If you are comfortable with Unix, this book will get you up to speed with Unix on the Mac.  You should at least know what things like 'grep', 'sed', 'awk' mean - if not, try the \\"Learning Unix for Mac OS X\\" book first.<br /><br />Like every other flavor of *nix, the Mac has it's own take on Unix services you may be familiar with.  If you open up the Terminal app, you can find most everything you would expect in the directory structure.  However, things don't always work as anticipated - which is where this book is really useful.  For example, one of the things that confused me when going from Unix (I used FreeBSD and Linux prior to Mac OS X) was how users and groups were used.<br /><br />There are enough differences between OS X and other flavors of *nix that this book is easily worth the cost.  From how to add startup items, to enabling existing Unix services, to dual-booting, to building packages, etc etc etc.  I'm sure some people will find things \\"missing\\" or not explained with enough detail, but I think it's covers just about everything most \\"Unix Geeks\\" will be interested in to familiarize themselves with the Mac's take on Unix.<br /><br />If you're looking for something specific (for example, VNC on Mac OS X), check out the index online from O'Reilly's web site and make sure it covers the topic you're interested in.	2005-06-19

I'm obviously not alone, as this book (as well as web sites devoted to panoramic photos and QuickTime VR) proves.<br /><br />This book takes eight different scenes and describes the artist's methods and thought processes to creating the panorama.  My favorite is the \\"Urban Sphere\\", which takes a set of photos an creates a sphere.  This creates a photo with no notion of top or bottom.  As you rotate the page around your brain focuses on what is \\"up\\" and the photo appears \\"new\\" every 45 degrees or so...  Uber-cool.<br /><br />The descriptions and instruction come from the artists perspective.  While it does have a \\"how to\\" feel, in my opinion, the value is in the artistic ideas and the information about how to get the shots to make a compelling panorama.<br /><br />If you've got a Canon camera, you probably have PhotoStitch on the CD that came with it - which is what got me originally hooked on panoramas.  While pretty cool, this book will take you beyond simple panoramas to artistic, visually unique panoramas.	2005-06-19

I would approximate that about half of the book is general Unix information that applies to all Unix/Linux variants.  The other half goes over how to use these commands with Tiger.<br /><br />It's not a big book and doesn't go into great detail, rather it gives short introductions to Unix utilities.  For example, entire books are written on grep and regular expressions, but here there are only seven pages or so devoted to this topic.  If you're already pretty comfortable with Unix, you may want to check out a different book (Mac OS X Tiger for Unix Geeks, for example).<br /><br />I liked (and wish there had been more of) the information on mdls and mdfind, which gives you command line access to Spotlight metadata information.<br /><br />I think the chapters on X11 and Fink, while interesting, might be a little too advanced for the beginner.  In my opinion, there isn't enough information on X11 and you should be pretty comfortable with Unix before diving into Fink.<br /><br />If you've never opened up Terminal to get a glimpse of Tiger's Unix capabilities, this is a great introduction.  Just be careful with the sudo command! :)	2005-06-14

(Note: I have very little experience with Java3D - as in, I've gone through the demos and not much else).  After reading through this book, I still think \\"killer\\" game programming is a generous description.  However, I did discover a pleasant side effect; it was a fun way to explore the Java3D APIs.<br /><br />This book does not spend any time on introductory java nor does it build a \\"killer\\" game from start to finish as it moves through the chapters.  There are snippets of source code throughout the book, but I'd suggest downloading the source.  The source code was very helpful, easy to compile and run.  I had no problems running the code on a Mac and Java 1.4.2.<br /><br />The text is very academic and thorough in its descriptions.  While the title might suggest \\"game programming\\" as the primary focus of the book, I think this is almost a secondary issue.  The real thrust (or at least what I got out of it) is a fun way to learn the techniques to 2D and 3D graphics programming, dealing with lighting, perspective, and movement using the Java Sound, Java 2D and Java 3D APIs.	2005-06-07

Primarily, to make sure my wireless network would be harder target for misuse than my neighbor's.  Beyond that, I wanted to make sure I was making the most efficient use of the two access points I have and to get the best possible signal from any point in the house and backyard.<br /><br />That said, this book was probably a bit of overkill for what I needed.  Don't get me wrong, it did a fine job of educating me on those topics, but it turns out that is only a small portion of the book.  I had to play a little hide-and-seek to find the information I was curious about.  However, it is hard to complain about too much information (it is the \\"802.11 Definitive Guide\\", after all) and I did appreciate it once I had found what I was looking for.  (Although, I have yet to read the chapters on MAC Fundamentals and Framing).  The book reminds me of a textbook in it's approach, without the quiz at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />The parts I found most useful were the chapters on WEP/Security, Architecture, Access Point placement, and Network Analysis.  There were plenty of charts and/or graphs I found helpful as well.  There are chapters on using 802.11 for Windows, Mac and Linux, so pretty much everybody on the planet is covered.<br /><br />If you're in charge of laying out a wireless network (or you just have to have a book in hand), this has a lot of great information and I'd recommend it.  If you're just looking for tips and pointers for putting together your home wireless network, you can probably get away with just googling, or, ummm,  A9ing :) a few web sites to get that job done.	2005-06-01

I have the first edition, which is more of a \\"how to use ant\\" book. The second edition is a \\"how to make ant useful\\" book.  In that way, the second edition is completely different from the first.  The chapters are \\"task\\" oriented as opposed to descriptions of Ant APIs.  For example, \\"Deploying Builds\\" covers various Ant tasks and properties that will help you put together an Ant build.xml to deploy a build.  An easy way to see if the book will work for you is to check the chapter headings.<br /><br />Well written and pretty comprehensive - whether you're already comfortable with ant or new to ant, this is definately a great book to pick up.	2005-05-26

The focus of the book is on convincing/helping people to switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox.  However, the \\"where/what/when/why/how\\" to switch to Firefox is sandwiched between a chapter on the \\"history of the browser\\" and a decent sized appendix on other browsers worth checking out.<br /><br />Having been a Firefox fan for a while now, I skipped over the \\"how to install\\" and \\"firefox basics\\" sections.  I jumped to the chapers on Firefox add-ons and advanced features.  While I did learn a few new things, I think if you are already pretty comfortable with Firefox there won't be any revelations.<br /><br />If you don't know why it matters how you browse the internet, the author makes a number of persuasive arguements as to why Firefox should be your browser of choice.<br /><br />Having said that, what I really enjoyed the brief history of the browser from the beginning of the \\"WWW\\" to the present.  The timeline leading up to the Netscape vs Microsoft Browser Wars, the hiccups and missteps along the way by various companies, and the \\"genealogy\\" of the various browsers was as interesting as it was educational.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.  If Firefox is something you've thought about installing or you've installed it and want to make sure you're getting the most out of it, this definately a book you should check out.	2005-05-04

Like the new iPhoto 5 Missing Manual, this one is in full color as well.<br /><br />What I liked best about this book is that it spends a majority of the time discussing how to take better shots, how to give the editing a more polished look, and generally how to improve your finished product.  Along with showing you how to use iMovie, the book goes over when and why (or why not!) to use the various  transitions and special effects.  Always with an eye toward \\"professional techniques\\".<br /><br />All told, a must have book on iMovie HD.<br /><br />One thing I was looking for but couldn't find was some discussion on iMovie HD vs Final Cut Express HD - what the differences are, why I would use one or the other, when to upgrade advice, etc.<br /><br />Oh, yeah - the information on iDVD is also great - plenty of tips and tricks on getting the most out of iDVD.  Once you get great looking movies, iDVD makes putting together a great looking DVD a snap.	2005-05-03

It provides you with all the information necessary - without any useless filler - to write an application using the Spring Framework.  It's like the ubiquitous \\"Hello, World\\" application on steroids.<br /><br />The authors do a good job at covering quite a number of different technologies, designs, frameworks, and patterns that can/do/should/could make use of the Spring framework.  The book spends a lot of time balancing between the 50,000 foot description and details in source code - and does so surprisingly well, a credit to the authors.  I did find myself on Google looking up information on technologies that were unfamiliar to me.<br /><br />The source code available for download includes the IDEA .ipr files (or it did when I downloaded it), so if you're using IDEA, the sample code is just that much easier to load up and go through.<br /><br />You're not going to be a \\"expert\\" after reading this book, but it is a great way to introduce yourself to the Spring Framework.	2005-04-29

For me, the reason was:  I wanted to learn about Python with a quick, hands-on approach.  In other words, show me some code I can punch out quickly; I was looking for some kind of instant gratification.  =)<br /><br />I jumped directly to the Index and looked up Mac OS X (my OS of choice).  There I found a few starters.  For example, Counting Pages of PDF Documents on Mac OS X.  While on the surface not very compelling or all that useful, it does show some native Python integration with the OS X CoreGraphics package - which I wasn't aware of.  After running that program (it took me an entire 30 seconds to write and execute) I bounced around the book looking for random cool things to try out.<br /><br />All the things you would expect to see in the cookbook are there; manipulating files, parsing time and dates, network programming, processing XML, etc, etc, etc.  One sections I appreciated was on debugging and testing, however I wish it was larger.  It was only 20 pages of the 800 total pages.<br /><br />I was already comfortable with Perl (Python will look somewhat familiar to Perl programmers) and just had never taken the time to sit down and explore Python.  This book was a quick and easy way to get my hands into Python and start learning a new language.	2005-04-24

I'm assuming if you're thinking of picking up this book it is because you've already got iPhoto 5 and are a little mystified by some of the features.  I've been using iPhoto from the beginning and it only gets better - as well as more complicated - with each release.<br /><br />If you don't already have a book on iPhoto - this is the one to get.  I have the iPhoto 4 Missing Manual (and love it) as well - if you're still using iPhoto 4, you can still get this book as 90% of the information is still relevant.  This book takes all the great stuff from the previous edition, adds color (that's reason enough to get this book, in my opinion) and goes into detail on the new features of iPhoto 5.<br /><br />The book goes beyond just a \\"how to\\" on iPhoto.  It spends a few chapters going over digital cameras and the basics of taking good pictures.  The information on iPhoto covers details that will satisfy both the beginner and advanced user.  From simply importing and arranging your pictures to using AppleScript, iPhoto 5: The Missing Manual is hard to beat.	2005-04-12

This book covers just about everything to do with securing your Apache server.  I imagine an Apache expert could point out deficiencies of this book, but I was able to find everything I was interested in - as well as a lot of great info I wasn't aware of.  Even though this is an \\"Apache Security\\" book, there is a lot of information on securing your web environment in general.<br /><br />I found the information on Denial of Service attacks very interesting.  While you can't stop a determined attacker, you can do a lot of things to minimize the effects.  I guess it is a bit like installing a car alarm - an attacker will realize there are plenty of other cars in the parking lot if you make yours less attractive a target.  I found the chapter on logging and monitoring very useful as well.  It describes how to get the most out of the potentially massive amounts of information that can be gleaned from the apache logs.	2005-04-12

I doubt any Postfix admin will be disappointed with this book, although it has way more information than I need at this point...  Always a good thing when a book answers your questions now and can answer new questions in the future. =)<br /><br />I'm no Postfix expert, but I this book is incredibly detailed and probably doesn't leave anything out.  I really like the fact that it doesn't just tip-toe through the config files and options.  It goes into a lot of detail, with a lot of instruction and examples.  More importantly, it steps you though how to test your configuration to verify any changes you make.<br /><br />The appendix describes how to install Postfix on Debian Linux or Red Hat Linux, so if you need  detailed installation instructions for other platforms, you need to look elsewhere.  However, once you get Postfix installed, this book will not disappoint.<br /><br />Very well done.	2005-04-04

As far as the information inside the book goes, it's a great book that describes the basics of Java in a simple, here's what you need to know format.  It describes everything you need to know about Java syntax, objects, etc, etc, etc.  The big reason to get this is for the Java 5.0 info, which is scattered throughout Chapter 2.  There is also Chapter 4, which goes into more detail on some of the more interesting features of Java 5.0.<br /><br />However, the bulk of the 1200+ pages are essentially the javadoc, with some additional notes.  In thumbing around and looking at random class descriptions, I didn't see anything I couldn't get from the javadoc.  This is obviously a personal preference - if you like the hardcopy, it might work for you.  It just seems like a waste to me.<br /><br />I would have been much happier with the first 400 pages and a note on page 401 that said \\"buy another book if you need the apis\\" or \\"go read the javadoc\\".  A 400 page Nutshell book I can throw in the backpack, thumb through, and carry around.  A 1200 page Nutshell (like Java 5.0 for that matter) seems to be suffering from a bit of unnecessary bloat.	2005-03-30

This is every bit the equal on the Java side (I have the 2nd Edition which covers Java 5.0).  The fact that so many people have reviewed the book says it all.  I like the casual, playful format, dialog and visuals.<br /><br />Beyond the addition of the new Java 5.0 features (and dropping of some outdated features of earlier versions) it is still the same innovative \\"Head First\\" format.  If you are learning Java or want to become more familiar with Java 5.0, I can guarantee you will not find a more enjoyable book to learn from.	2005-03-28

It has a variety of scenarios that an admin might run into describing how someone might implement a cyber-attack.  The interesting part is how each admin chose to \\"defend\\" their network, which is laid out in greater detail than the description of the attack.<br /><br />The fictional attacks were well written and interesting enough just as individual short stories.  I learned about a lot of different tools.  The stories may even hit close to home if you're an admin.  They are explained very well and include a lot of code and/or information; easily understandable if you have a little computer background.<br /><br />I liked this book, while I was not surprised by the types (and apparent ease) of the fictionalized attacks, I did learn a lot about tools and methods for defending a network.	2005-03-27

What better one to build that the one that started the personal computer revolution?<br /><br />The first few chapters go over the basics, although, in my opinion you should be familiar with computer terms such as breadboard, gates, and flip-flop if you plan to build the \\"Apple I\\" replica.  I found the \\"build your own Apple I\\" chapter suprisingly short until I realized it was just the \\"here's how to put together the Apple I replica from a kit you can purchase\\".  It took me a while to figure out that you can either A) build an Apple I completely from scratch using the schematic that comes with the CD or B) purchase the Replica kit and put it together.  Option B is obviously quicker and easier, as it also comes with the ROM already loaded with BASIC.  Option A is the \\"we don't need no stinkin' help\\" way to do things...  Since you can purchase some parts of the Replica kit separately, I suppose you could do a combo A/B approach.<br /><br />The later chapters go over BASIC and Assembly, followed by a large Appendix explaining opcodes, instructions and electrical engineering basics.  Also included is an Appendix called \\"Hacking Macintosh\\" which describes how to take your Mac (the original, not the iMac) apart and create a \\"Lego\\" case, a way to hack your mouse and a way to apply a colored skin to the G4 Cube.  While entertaining, it has nothing to do with the rest of the book and just seems completely out of place.  I can only assume this is there to get readers to go check out the author's web site.<br /><br />I was in grade school when the Apple I came out, so I think I will enjoy trying to put this book through it's paces and see how much of the Apple I I can put together myself.  It looks like a fun (and educational) project to try out.	2005-03-18

I like the smaller, \\"bookish\\" form factor as it makes it feel more - well, uhh - like a book.  Since this is a magazine, I was curious to see how many ads I was going to have to wade through.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover there were hardly any; I hope they keep them to a minimum going forward.<br /><br />The \\"how to\\" articles are very well done, with a great amount of step-by-step information in both visual and written detail.  My only problem now is time.  Every project looked like so much fun it was disappointing to realize I wouldn't be able to do them all before the next issue would arrive and give me a whole new set of cool projects.  =)  My personal time management issues aside, Make is high-quality publication, top to bottom.	2005-03-15

However, it is not a \\"paint-by-numbers-tutorial\\" approach, rather the decisions for using various Photoshop tools are discussed (for the most part) from an artistic point of view.<br /><br />I enjoy learning from other people how they use Photoshop.  I doubt any two people, given the same task, would follow the same path to arrive at the result.	2005-03-11

Each project follows a different artist's design and thought processes, which is really pretty cool - it is effectively nine different authors rolled into one book.<br /><br />This is not so much a tutorial as it is an artistic guide.  Unlike the traditional \\"how to\\" books which tell you how to get from point A to B, this book seems more geared toward the artistic elements and how to use Photoshop (among other digital tools) to realize your goal.	2005-03-11

It mixes in a little Struts + database related stuff (Hibernate, MySQL), a little Struts + XML, a little Struts + JSTL, a little Struts + JWebUnit, and so on.  While I wouldn't suggest getting this book if you want to learn everything there is to know about hooking Struts up with Hibernate (for example), it does give you a pretty nice overview of a variety of things you might want to integrate/use with your Struts application.<br /><br />The book's assumption is you have some experience with Struts, Tomcat (or other servlet container), JSPs and Java.  If you're not comfortable with any of those I'd recommend getting familiar with those first.  Other than that, this is a nice book with plenty of examples to increase your Struts knowledge - whatever your current level may be.	2005-03-08

I never really gave it much thought - until I started looking at various AppleScript I pulled from the web.  I picked up this book to educate myself a little better on AppleScript.<br /><br />There are plenty of scripts ready to tweak and also plenty information to get building AppleScript on your own.  I appreciated the pictures and figures on every couple pages break it up - which is good because it gets a little verbose at times. =)  I also liked the \\"Power User Clinic\\" sections that give a little extra info.<br /><br />Well done - I'll be an AppleScript expert in no time. =)	2005-02-21

About half of the hacks you could probably find on Google's web site with the other half being true \\"Google hacks\\".<br /><br />I thought one of the more interesting hacks was #91 Remove your Materials from Google.  It describes how to prevent Google from storing your information as well as how to get it removed once Google has it.	2005-02-17

I am, however, a software developer, and as a developer, I find it tempting to do things \\"just because I can\\".  This book gives me the well-deserved smack upside the head when I get excited about some cool (and usually pointless or gaudy) new CSS or JavaScript effect.<br /><br />The book first discusses elements that make a small web site great - i.e. simplicity, context, and organization.  It then moves on to explaining how to create the proper focus and discusses proper use of color, images and navigation.  There are also sections on marketing, selecting a web designer (if you don't want to do-it-yourself), and what to do when you need a \\"big\\" web site.<br /><br />The end of the book is devoted to developing web sites for professional services, trade services, specialty services, artists, writers and performers, and restaurants.  These provide plenty of variety and suggestions you can take and apply to your own small web site.<br /><br />Plenty of common sense and direction.  If you are looking for a set of guidelines for creating a quality small web site, this book fits the bill.	2005-02-01

It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered.  It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.<br /><br />That said, I found most of it very interesting.  It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered.  If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink.  I enjoyed reading it.	2005-02-01

The nice thing about this book (and all \\"hacks\\" books, for that matter) is the broad spectrum of ideas and suggestions.  As a lot of this stuff was new to me, I appreciated the amount of detail the author goes into for each hack.<br /><br />I found the hacks on Calibration (#60 - #74) the most helpful for getting noticable improvements quickly.  There are also plenty of other simple tips here and there (i.e. lighting, wiring, warm-up vs burn-in) to enhance my home theater.  However, the book was a bit over my head at times -- therefore very educational.  I'm going to have to install some bass shakers (Hack #40)  into my couch as my first project. =)	2005-01-18

While I consider myself somewhat competent on the geek scale, this book was quite an eye opener as to how much I didn't realize went on from a technical standpoint.  I'm reminded of that saying (I'm sure you heard it as a kid as well) that goes something like, \\"if you'd just focus that energy toward something constructive...\\"  There is enough information in the book to get you started in the spam business, but I wouldn't worry about a new rash of spam as a result of this book.  I doubt any of this couldn't be discovered googling around the internet.<br /><br />While I hate spam as much as the next guy, I was surprised to find myself agreeing with some of the \\"pro-spam\\" points brought up in this book.  (Don't worry, I quickly gave myself a few lashings...)  There is also quite a bit of discussion about the CAN-SPAM act that effectively makes it pointless - especially for a \\"legit\\" spammer.  (Yep, spam can be legit.)<br /><br />Spam Cartel was very educational and gave me plenty of ideas as to how to keep my own spam filters up to speed.  I also find myself examining the spam that does get through and understanding why.  Knowledge is power - and this book is full of information.  However, it does seem to get a little repetitive at time and the title is a bit of a misnomer - I would have gone with \\"Confessions of a Spammer\\" or something clich&eacute; like that.  :)	2005-01-10

I found it a genuine and fascinating peek into both the \\"birth of the Mac\\" and the emerging personal computer industry as a whole.  It's tough to fathom what it must have been like to write an entire operating system and applications with only 128K to work with.<br /><br />Being in the software industry myself, I could identify with a lot of the programming situations and unique characters that end up in software development.  It was oddly comforting to find that certain things haven't really changed that much.  My favorite in this regard was a short entry about a management decision to \\"track progress\\" by entering the number of lines coded that week.  One guy put down \\"-2000\\", as he had done some optimizing and was able to get rid of a lot of extra source code.<br /><br />Great nuggets of information about how things came into existence.  For instance, the \\"Command\\" key icon, the boot beep, and the original font names.  A glimpse at what it was like to work for Steve Jobs was also captivating.<br /><br />All told, a must read.	2004-12-21

At first I was disappointed as it wasn't as intuitive as iMovie (silly me).  However, the more I played with it I realized all I needed was a guide book to help me along.  This book filled that role perfectly.<br /><br />It starts out explaining the basics of professional video editing, which cleared up about 50% of my confusion.  It is easy to read and easy to jump around to pick and choose topics to explore.  The text is structure as a start to finish tutorial, but I found it worked really well as a reference, too.  I was able to quickly jump from the index to a topic when I got stuck or wanted to know how to do something.<br /><br />Within half an hour, I was editing old footage of a Half Dome hike - not necessarily \\"like a pro\\". However, I was creating segments, adding text, importing Photoshop images (maps of Yosemite), and chopping out all the slow spots to put together a short \\"not quite as boring as before\\" video of the hike. =)<br /><br />This book was perfect for me.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone comfortable with iMovie who wants to move on to Final Cut - you won't need iMovie any more.	2004-12-20

The book reveals in \\"coffee table format\\" a little history, a number of confessions, and plenty of portraiture from the birth of the Mac to the present day.  My favorite chapter discusses the \\"Fantasy Macs\\".  Mac devotees all over the world design and publish incredibly innovative and fanciful images of imaginary (and sometimes not so imaginary) Macs.<br /><br />A must have for the True Mac user.  For the rest, a little taste of what you've been missing out on for the last twenty years.	2004-12-15

Since this is an O'Reilly Hacks title, the text occasionally taps into the vocabulary familiar to computer geeks (like myself) - \\"Hack #33: Neural noise isn't a bug, it's a feature\\" - but not always.  This book could just as easily find it's way on the Psychology shelf.<br /><br />Each article also has a list of End Notes that give you further reading on each topic, which was really nice.  Each \\"hack\\" is also cross-referenced very well with the other similar hacks, so you can bounce all over the book reading about various aspects of brain function.  My favorite article discusses the \\"Hypnagogic State\\" - the sometimes brief period between wakefulness and sleep...  I seem to find myself in that state quite a bit - now I have a name for it. =) =) =)<br /><br />If you're interested in psychology or curious about the how and why, this could be a fun book to check out.

I suppose it's pretty tough to write a book about annoyances - since what annoys me may not annoy somebody else.  However, I did find a few answers that I didn't already know.  The book is definately written for someone between beginner and advanced.  A good portion of the \\"annoyances\\" are things an advanced user would already know (or be able to figure out easy enough) and there isn't enough detail for the beginner.<br /><br />The section on Microsoft Office annoyances (and fixes) was pretty helpful, but you could fill an encyclopedia with things that are annoying in the Office apps - Mac or Windows.  The stuff on browsers is ok, but most of it was \\"since Safari can't do X, use browser Y\\".  I was also a bit confused by the discussion of the \\"new, free browser Thunderbird\\".  I suppose you could browse with an email client... =)<br /><br />The annoyances are all over the Mac spectrum - my guess is you'd be lucky to find 20 or so of the 150 annoyances included that might pertain to your situation.	2004-12-12

This is a great introduction to the &#60;insert word that doesn't sound as obnoxious as &#34;plethora&#34; or &#34;myriad&#34; here&#62; of tools and utilites that will make your routine java development easier.<br /><br />While it is not a comprehensive book, each chapter takes a look at various areas of Java development and which of the Commons libraries provide classes and methods to handle common routines.  Covered are things like Text Manipulation, JavaBeans utils, Collections (stuff that isn't in the offical JDK... yet) and  Math functions.  Personally, I didn't realize just how cool some of the Math functions are - so that was an interesting read.  I like the fact that there was a lot of source examples in the book, too.<br /><br />I think O'Brien does a nice job at balancing the Commons stuff with the topics that are better handled by a more focused book.  For example, he just touches on XML and Log4J - so if you're looking for a book that has details on getting logging up, running and configured (for example), this isn't it.<br /><br />If you want to know if you should incorporate any of the Jakarta Commons stuff in your development, this book will give you plenty of reasons why.	2004-12-08

At only 100 pages and a small 6 inch by 6 inch form factor, this book isn't something you'd get to dive into the Mac world.  (However, it does recommend plenty of other books to pick up.)  This book would be great as a \\"Stocking Stuffer\\" (being the holiday season) or a welcome gift for the owner of a PowerBook.  It covers at a high level the various things you might want to know about; from cases, screen protectors and travel kits to the included Mac software.<br /><br />Full color pictures throughout the book make it a gorgeous piece of eye-candy as well.  While it does contain a lot of useful information, the real reason you get the book is simply because it is cool...  Just like the PowerBook.	2004-12-03

Despite having never used Nessus before, I was able to run a scan against a couple Windows machines within a few minutes after installation (and not suprised to find several \\"Security Holes\\").<br /><br />As a new user of Nessus, I can't really comment on the coverage of the information in the book - other reviewers seem to think highly of it.

The author does a great job describing not only how Java handles network programming, but the concepts and details of network programming in general.  The book takes the core java.net classes and describes each method, what it does, how to use it, what to watch for, code examples, etc - it takes the API Javadoc and expands upon it.<br /><br />It's a great Java Network API reference book.	2004-11-23

JUnit caused a major shift in the way people thougth about development.  While the basic framwork was originally developed with Smalltalk, JUnit is what started the Unit Test Framework \\"revolution\\".  This book explores the various xUnit options available for other languages.<br /><br />Up to this point, I have only used the xUnit Test Framework with JUnit and Java.  The book does a nice job explaining how to apply the Unit Test Framework to any development project.  It goes into more depth on JUnit, CppUnit, NUnit (.NET), PyUnit (Python), and XMLUnit.  I like the fact I now have a single book to get me started Unit Testing in pretty much any other language.<br /><br />In my opinion, the book should have included more depth on the various other xUnit implementations.  It also comes with a CD which contains and entire 14Mb of code and examples, which seemed a little silly.  The examples could have easily been downloaded from somewhere and saved some money on the price of the book.<br /><br />A nice start and does a good job covering a few of the xUnit Frameworks, but I wish it had taken the extra time to cover more implementations.	2004-11-13

If you are new to Java GUI development, this would be a great starter for someone interested in developing an application using SWT.  It covers most of the basic SWT components and how to put them together and create and application.  I thought the code examples were sufficient and well documented.<br /><br />However, I don't think I was the target audience for this book.  Already being familiar with Swing, I was hoping for more details on SWT and what the differences were between SWT, AWT and Swing.  This notebook essentially assumes you aren't that familiar with GUI development in general.  It would have helped me had there been phrases such as \\"If you're familiar with the Swing you can skip X and note the way SWT does Y\\".  I think about 60% or so of the notebook describes information someone familiar with AWT or Swing would already feel comfortable doing.<br /><br />A good book for beginners, but I was hoping for something more.	2004-11-09

Not with this book.  Odd as it may sound, this book makes learning about design patterns fun.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is the pages are not paragraph after paragraph of information.  There isn't a single page that doesn't contain a doodle, a sidebar, a picture, or something different.  While at times it can be a little distracting, it's in a good way (at least I don't have to poke myself with something sharp anymore).<br /><br />The chapters cover various design patterns and along the way have exercises such as crossword puzzles or match games to test your understanding.  The answers are also included at the end of the chapters - so you don't need to purchase a \\"Teacher's Edition\\" on the black market.  =)<br /><br />Other books on design patterns are saying, \\"Buehler...  Buehler...  Buehler...\\" while this book is on the float belting out \\"Shake it up, baby!\\"	2004-11-09

Those people who want to use a web service from a company described in the book and people who are interested in learning about some real world applications using web services.  The number of companies discussed are few, but they are the big players.  I liked the discussion of web services in general and how they can be (and are) used in real world applications.<br /><br />This book shows you - with copious amounts of code - how to use various services provided by real companies right away.  For me, this book was a great way to gather ideas about different approaches to provide and interact with web services.  It does a great job at proving how simple web services really are.<br /><br />Although web services are not language-specific, the book and all the examples are in Java.  You should be pretty comfortable with Java, Tomcat, and similar technologies to be able to get the examples working.  The companies/web services discussed are: Amazon, eBay, Google, FedEx, PayPal, CDDB.  It also discusses interacting with bloggers.	2004-11-04

The writing got me hooked and I had to see how it ended.  Strangely, though, it doesn't really end.  Despite the non-ending, I enjoyed reading the story of spammers and those people fighting spam.<br /><br />The book is kind of a pseudo-biography of various real-life characters, hiding behind online personas.  There are the spammers and their attempts to get junk to your inbox.  There are the anti-spammers who track down the spammers and report that information to various spam fighting web sites.  There are also several side stories to provide the setting and context for the story.<br /><br />What I found most interesting was the fact that you could go out to the web sites referenced in the book and validate the information yourself.  After reading the book, I went out to the NANAE (news.admin.net-abuse.email) group on Google and searched on some of the characters in the book.  [ You'll find a discussion about this book itself as well - disagreements between some of the character's recollections of events and the author's descriptions - very entertaining ]<br /><br />It was both an interesting and educational read, which I enjoyed.  While I have a pretty good spam filter, it was educational to look at the spam that gets through my email fitler with a new perspective.  I could track the originator of the spam to one of the spammers described in the book using web servers in China.<br /><br />It makes you wonder how to fix the spam problem - or if there even is a fix.	2004-11-02

Quick disclosure - I'm a big fan of JUnit already. :)  Anything that will convince java developers to use JUnit is a good thing.  JUnit is as powerful as it is simple.  To prove it, everything you need to know about JUnit is in this 80 page pocket guide.  If you are a Java programmer, this pocket guide will easily convince you to add JUnit to your daily development processes.  It covers the entire JUnit API, using JUnit with Ant, Extending JUnit, and plenty of suggestions on how to test various situations with JUnit.<br /><br />I liked the descriptions on how to run JUnit standalone or within various IDEs (Eclipse, JBuilder and IntelliJ IDEA).  I have been working with JUnit in Eclipse for quite some time and recently started a project using IntelliJ IDEA - so it helped me get JUnit going quickly.  I also found the short history on JUnit interesting as well.<br /><br />Whether you're new to Java development or just haven't used JUnit yet, this is the perfect pocket guide to help you get started.	2004-10-29

There are plenty of fun things to do that don't take much effort.<br /><br />There is an informative description of Application Bundles which provides the foundation for a lot of the easier mods.  There are plenty of pictures and each mod that I tried out was well documented.  I had the most fun just changing the icons and property list strings for various apps.<br /><br />I also liked the notes on \\"Undocumented Preferences\\" - using an image as the background for the Terminal app is cool.  It was also neat to see how some of the tools floating out on the internet (such as TinkerTool or Safari Enhancer) do what they do.<br /><br />Nicely done.	2004-10-28

However, it sums up the book quite well - why reinvent the wheel.  =)  The book is a user-friendly subset of the website macosxhints.com, which was created by the author.  Despite being a small subset of hints, I like it better than the web site because you don't have to figure out what the correct search criteria are in order to come up with the hint you're looking for - just scan the table of contents.  I'll wade through the website if I can't find what I'm looking for in the book.<br /><br />As with anything, people like doing things different ways.  Some people are into the keyboard shortcuts, some people use the mouse for everything, everybody else is somewhere in between.  I appreciate that the hints dealing with the user interface give you various ways to complete the task.<br /><br />Finally, to echo an earlier review, the hints dealing with the various web browsers are well worth reading.  Among other things, it brought to my attention that your browsing history can not only be tracked by storing info in the cache or cookies, but by the favicon.ico files as well.  Not that it really matters, but was an interesting (and smack-your-forehead-duh) hint.	2004-10-18

After acquiring the Adobe Photoshop CS one-on-one book (and loving it) I thought I would get a hold of this book to see if it could help me become, at least, comfortable with InDesign - and possibly help with putting it to good use rather than be the application I ignore from the Creative Suite.<br /><br />For all the reasons people like the Photoshop book in this series, people are going to like this one as well.  It is visually elegant, bright, and colorful.  The same \\"Pearls of Wisdom\\" break up the text to provide you with various insights and \\"Oh, by the way\\"s.  As a novice InDesign user, I can't really speak to the content and coverage of InDesign, but it was plenty for me to familiarize myself with the features and functions.<br /><br />I also enjoy the author's relaxed tone and humor, which makes the book a lot easier to read than the stiff \\"Do A, then B, then C\\" voice of some tutorials.  Be warned, some of the jokes will elicit a groan - but you'll be smiling when you do. =)<br /><br />I now have a great book to help me out when the time comes to fire up InDesign. =)	2004-10-16

The premise - manipulating an election - takes current events and blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction.  In my opinion, if this were a movie, it would go straight to video.<br /><br />That said, depending on your interest in computers, the novel portion and the included CD to \\"hack along\\" with the story might be quite a bit of fun.  The web site for the book (as of 10/15) has an encrypted message which you can decipher using some of the techniques in the book - and will add more things to do as time goes on.  It's an interesting way to make a \\"print\\" book interactive.<br /><br />I liked the information found in Part II of the book, which goes into a brief history of voting, reverse engineering, cryptography, buffer overflows and steganography.  I think it does a pretty good job at pointing out how easy, as least conceptually, manipulating digital information really is.	2004-10-16

Each description of the individual statements has a \\"Programming Tips and Gotchas\\" which can be really helpful.  I appreciated the \\"Rules at a Glance\\" in each section which give just a quick overview of each statement - the details are described in the section for each database (DB2, Oracle, MySQL, etc).<br /><br />However, for me personally, the massive amount of quantity also leads to my frustration trying to look up a specific statement.  The font is small (or at least appears small) and the text looks crammed together - it's tough to see where one thing starts and another ends.  There is a margin indicator marking 400+ pages as the \\"Statement\\" section, which is just a big black streak down the edge of the book.  I think would have been more helpful had it been alphabetic margin indicator tabs (A, B, C and so on) - this would have made finding statements easier.<br /><br />So, there's my problem - a great book on content (I wouldn't want to see less), but tough (at least for me) to quickly find what I'm looking for - which is what you want in a desktop reference.<br /><br />Content = 5 stars<br />Readability = 3 stars	2004-10-15

Not that I think there's anything really worth hacking on my home network, but I thought I'd spend a little time learning about intrusion detection.  This book is great for several reasons.  First, it is well put together and easy to follow.  Second, it describes in detail the open source project Snort.  Finally, it satisfied my curiosity about IDS (Intrusion detection systems) - I'm not an expert, but I now understand the concepts.<br /><br />Even though the book did not mention OS X specifically, it was easy to get snort compiled and installed on my Mac.  There were a few tweaks I had to do, but if you're familiar with \\"configure; make; make install\\", it should be a snap.  (Likewise, fink or darwinports can get you going with Snort as well).  Any other flavor of Unix/Linux would be that much easier to install.<br /><br />Beyond just describing how to install and configure Snort, the book does go into some detail about how networks are attacked and how Snort goes about alerting you to possible intrusive behavior.  There are also numerous reference to web sites and other books to find more information.  It also goes into detail on various other tools that augment and complement Snort.<br /><br />Very well done.	2004-10-09

Personally, I liked the format and the no-nonsense approach.  It just gets you up and running with Hibernate, no more, no less.  I don't think you need to be an \\"expert\\", but you should have at least a working understanding of Java, O/R Mapping, Ant, and SQL.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that the examples build upon each other as the chapters introduce new topics - no potential confusion with disparate examples for each topic.  The Hibernate web site and documentation is already an excellent resource for learning all about Hibernate, and this book does not try to rewrite any of it.  It does, however, defer to the online information quite a bit.<br /><br />I was looking for a quick, hands on book to get Hibernate up and running.  This book worked out great.	2004-10-07

However, the 3rd Edition might as well have been published as a new book.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the organization, chapter layout and code examples are essentially all new - not just tweaked from the previous edition.  If you're looking for a good book on threads, this is it.<br /><br />The example code is well done, and the concepts are illustrated satisfactorily.  If you download the examples from the web site, each chapter has a list of the code samples and the ant tasks to run to use them, which was a nice touch.  While the concepts behind Java Threads apply to most versions of Java, I'd say this book is really geared toward the J2SE 5.0 environment.<br /><br />It's too bad Amazon can't reset the rating for each edition, as the 3rd Edition is quite an improvement.  Be sure to check out reviews starting in September 2004, when this book was published.	2004-09-29

I also went back and forth as to whether or not I agreed with some of the information so many times I gave up counting.  So, I guess if nothing else this book made me think - which is always the hallmark of a good book, in my opinion.  The book is organized well and the authors present their case for \\"Better, Faster, Lighter Java\\" in a careful and concise manner.<br /><br />This is not really a \\"here's how to implement technology X\\" book (i.e. if you want to learn about Hibernate, pick another book).  It does more to promote concepts and ideas to avoid \\"bad programming\\".  It provides a lot of opinion and argument for and against various frameworks, design patterns, programming methodologies, etc.  It is quite obvious the authors are convinced and passionate about their view of software development.  If you've ever asked yourself, \\"why do we have to use such complicated stuff to do even the simplest of things?\\", then this book will give you plenty of ammunition to backup your argument.<br /><br />It's a rare software development book that I actually read (let alone re-read) almost cover to cover.  While you may not agree with everything in the book, it will make you re-evaluate your development techniques.	2004-09-27

As a Mac guy, I've found the \\"Save As PDF...\\" button on any Print dialog something I end up using a lot.  I was hoping to find a few different (preferrably free) ways to do something similar with my Windows machine I use at work.  Hack #39 solved the problem.<br /><br />The rest of the Hacks were more of a PDF education for me than anything else.  I appreciated the numerous explanations, such as Hack #43 Embed and Subset Fonts to your Advantage, which described the need (or not) of embedded fonts in a PDF.  I also like the descriptions about how to make your PDFs smaller (Hack #40).  I also found the section on publishing interesting.<br /><br />I used to think the only thing anyone ever did was distribute and read PDFs.  This book proved there was much more to PDFs than that.	2004-09-18

Every image is in full color, so no fuzzy shades of grey to squint at - and it's not just the images, color is used throughout.  The cover is interesting - there is a full cover over the whole book and second cover over the top of the first which only covers the bottom two-thirds of the book.  Functional? Hmmm... Use it as a bookmark, I suppose - regardless, it looks cool.  The table of contents - though the term \\"table of contents\\" seems a bit drab in this case - are available on the edge of every page.<br /><br />There is suprising amount of substance inside as well.  While it does not go into a lot of detail, it does give a good feel for a wide variety of things pertaining to your iPod.  It has plenty of info on iPod accessories like headphones, infrared remote, cases, and if you can call a BMW an iPod accessory, it's got info on that, too.  There are also descriptions on how to enjoy DVD soundtracks on your iPod; how to record internet radio; battery management tips; how to transform your iPod into a PDA; how to download song lyrics.  There are probably better books for in-depth details on the iPod, but this one doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Am I a sucker for a cool looking book?  Guilty - you should see my coffee table.  For me, the fact that it contains useful information as well is just icing on the cake.	2004-09-10

You should already be familiar with CSS, JavaScript and HTML - this is not a CSS starter book.  It's more geared toward start to finish answers for common CSS questions, most of which I found I could easily adapt to my level of understanding.  There is an in-depth description about how to create a very nice looking calendar with CSS (using HTML tables) which I liked a lot.  However, for me personally, I will probably stick with O'Reilly's CSS: The Definitive Guide.<br /><br />I'm sure it was done for monetary reasons, but it would have been nice if the figures were in color - or at least the figures supporting the elements that deal with color.  It was tough to distinguish between shades of grey or follow the arrows with the words \\"blue\\" or \\"green\\" on one end pointing to an area.  I know, I know, picky picky.  :)  So - while I'm being picky... :)  The foreward mentions \\"...compiling hundreds of CSS recipes into this single book\\" - but by my count, there are only 89 Problem/Solution/Discussion sections (aka recipes).  I would like to have seen \\"hundreds of CSS recipes\\", which would have provided greater variety to the solutions.	2004-09-10

It made taking home movies fun.  The great thing about this book is it goes beyond just a how-to or tips and tricks.  A lot of the book is devoted to the dos and don'ts of creating home movies in general.  Just as with still photography, the hard work is when your taking the shot, not afterward.  The better your movie is at filming, the less work you'll have to do when you get it into iMovie.<br /><br />The book is packed with a 450+ pages of information.  Some examples: how to get your old VHS movies into iMovie, sending movies to your cell phone, creating better looking \\"title cards\\", and modifying iDVD itself.  If you liked David Pogue's iPhoto 4 Missing Manual and/or GarageBand Missing Manual (both of which I have), this book is a must have.	2004-09-05

If you're looking for explanation or detail, I'd suggest either the CSS Cookbook or CSS - The Definitive Guide.<br /><br />This would be useful for someone who already knows the basics and is comfortable with CSS, but doesn't have everything memorized or is new to CSS 2.  For myself, once I've learned the basics of something, it's nice to have something to flip through for reminders and simple examples.<br /><br />The first 30 pages or so cover the basic rules for CSS, while the remaining pages contain brief explanations of each CSS element - grouped and arranged in alphabetical order.	2004-09-05

Let's be clear, it's a book about licenses and legal issues.  If you're not a lawyer, don't try to read this without your favorite caffeinated beverage within reach.<br /><br />If you are considering releasing software under a free or open source license, this book does a fine job at comparing and contrasting the different types of existing licenses.  It gives you examples from existing software projects of what types of things may happen with your software based on which type of license you choose to distribute your code under.<br /><br />On the flipside, if you are considering using some of open source software in a commercial project, this will give you pointers as to what types of things you can and can't do with software licensed under the various free and open source licenses.  The author's explanations are easy to understand.<br /><br />It also describes the Sun Community Source License, which explains what you can and can't do with the Java source code, for example, which I found interesting.  The only thing I didn't find an explanation for was why every license needs to USE ALL CAPS SOMEWHERE in the text... =)<br /><br />The book does what it sets out to do; compare and contrast the various free and open source licenses.	2004-09-02

Even my four year old daughter was able (with a minimum amount of help) to put together some piano, guitar and drum loops that sounded great.  However, after the cool-factor wore off, GarageBand went back into a dusty corner of the Applications folder, until I picked up this book.<br /><br />The value of this book is in the descriptions and explanations of GarageBand's features for the the Non-musician (I.e. Me).  This book uncovers plenty of useful tips and suggestions to get the most out of GarageBand.  I had great fun playing with the effects, now that I know what they mean - besides, it's fun to be able to use \\"flanger\\" properly in a sentence.	2004-08-19

If you're unsure of how to do something in Java, it's a pretty good bet there is an answer in this book.  The second edition includes coverage of the Java 1.5 release (such as generic types and enumerations) and updates or adds missing info from previous versions (such as the Java regular expressions API).<br />Most of the &quot;recipes&quot; in the cookbook have reference to other &quot;recipes&quot;, online resources or other books - and not always other O'Reilly books, which implies (at least to me) the author really wants to get you the best information possible.  Also, both the Table of Contents and the Index are well laid out and will help you get a quick answer to any question you may have.<br />The book assumes you have basic Java knowledge, but I'd recommend it for any Java programmer, beginner or advanced.  There are a lot of examples included in the text and you can download the source from the author's web site.  This should be at the top of any Java developer's list of books to own.<br />Highly recommend.	2004-07-16

The hacks in this book seem to end up in one of three categories.  Useful to me, useful to somebody else, and just plain weird (but good for a laugh).  The last is represented by Hack #60 - iOscillate.  Think iChat, iSight, some adhesive, and a stripped down oscillating fan.  Mac people have all the fun...<br />I found the hacks involving bluetooth, cellphones and your Mac worth the price of the book.  Prior to this I &quot;wanted&quot; a bluetooth phone.  Now I &quot;need&quot; a bluetooth phone. =)  I was also happy to find the info on getting the Postfix Mail Server running.<br />The great thing about the hacks, IMHO, is that despite there only being 10 hacks or so that you might find useful enough to start using right away, you're bound to come up with another few on your own.  For example, by combining what I learned from a few of the hacks, I was able to set up Virex to scan my Mail inbox for viruses every 15 minutes.

There is a bit of overlap between the two books - the author makes references to his &quot;Eclipse&quot; book in several of the Eclipse Cookbook recipes.<br />If you're already comfortable with Eclipse and are moving into SWT programming, there are a few chapters I found helpful in this area.  Plenty of code samples to get started with SWT - which is why I'm keeping the book.  I also liked the information on CVS and Ant.<br />However, I did feel like the book was a little thin on details at time - I think there could have been a bit more than the 175 &quot;recipes&quot; contained in the book.  For example, I would have liked to see a section on getting Eclipse loaded and running on different platforms.	2004-07-11

This is an excellent text covering a wide variety of investment topics; from do-it-yourself Excel spreadsheets for tracking and evaluating investment ideas to understanding technical analysis to online trading (and pretty much everything in between).  There is a wealth of diverse investing information in each of the 100 &quot;hacks&quot;.<br />I really liked the short &quot;hacks&quot; format - which really reads more like an informative news article.  I don't have the patience to read an entire book about Technical Analysis, so this book was perfect for me.  Each &quot;investing hack&quot; is any where from a couple pages to 10 or more which makes the book very easy to read.  Curious about line and bar charts, candlestick charts, point and figure charts, or more importantly, how to spot patterns in techincal charts?  Turn to the Hacks 46-53 on Technical Analysis.  Mutual Funds?  Hacks 59-72.  Hindsight is 20/20, but if you're interested in how Enron and WorldCom cooked the books, there are hacks that point to the warning signs in a company's financial statements (Hack #39 - Spot Hanky Panky with Cash Flow Analysis).<br />Each hack also references other hacks in the book as well as online resources available (both free and fee-based sites) if you'd like more information.  This book makes an excellent reference collection of investing &quot;hacks&quot; - there is something for everybody, whatever your online investing skill level and investment style may be.  I have already put a few of the Excel hacks to good use!	2004-07-08

There are plenty of books and television shows on keeping your home, life, etc organized, why not a book on how to keep your Mac organized?  That's exactly what this book sets out to do. While quite a bit of the information could be categorized as common sense, there are still a lot of useful tips and suggestions that will help you \\"degunk\\".<br />The author points out that a lot of the ideas behind keeping your computer \\"gunk-free\\" have less to do with technology and more to do with psychology.  I.e. You have to want to keep your computer \\"degunked\\".  The basic idea is this: a well organized Mac runs better and faster than one full of \\"gunk\\".<br />There are great suggestions on how to free up disk space, how to deal with spam, and why or when to add hardware.  However, the text occasionally seems to lack a bit of polish and a few suggestions seemed a touch odd to me.  For example, the suggestion, \\"If you use an iPod regularly, create a folder on your desktop (or an alias to your Music or iTunes folder) so that you can access those files quickly.\\"<br />Overall, the book is a great idea - with plenty of room for future editions to build on the \\"degunking\\" process.  If you are looking for ideas to help you organize and \\"degunk\\" your Mac, I'd definitely give it a look.	2004-06-23

Any book that gets you to put it down several times to immediately try out some of the hacks is a good book in my opinion.  I set the book down for Hack #25 - Painless Infrared Photography.  I grabbed my digital camera and a TV remote and 10 seconds later I discovered I have a camera that can take infrared photographs.  Cool!<br />There's also a cool hack that inspired me to make my first QuickTime VR movie (albeit not a very good one) by stitching together a bunch of panoramic shots with Photoshop.  There are plenty of fun ideas from using everyday objects as lens filters to flash hacks.  The hacks are all over the map, too.  Hacks for Camera Phones, camera attachments, Photoshop hacks, Fax from your digital camera...<br />If you're looking for a fun book that is bound to inspire you to come up with your own hacks, this is your book!	2004-06-21

This is an excellent text - do yourself a favor and read all the reviews.<br />For me, I really appreciated the sidebars and &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; scattered throughout the text.  In these, the author gives quick insights like; why one tool works better than another or a keystroke reminder or a technical definition.<br />This book does much more than just tell you how to do something, it also explains why your image changes when using the various tools.  In other words, it goes beyond just getting you from A to B.  There are a million different ways to get from A to B in Photoshop, so it's nice to learn a few new ones to add to my current Photoshop knowledge.<br />I use Photoshop basically for two things.  Fixing up photos I've taken with my digital camera or scanned in from the family archives and creating images for my personal web site.  I found the chapters about highlights, midtones, and shadows and color correction invaluable, especially when trying to fix up some old color pictures of the family from '70s. =)<br />Excellent book, visually pleasing, highly recommend.	2004-06-17
US	48724135	R12JZ1ISH4CIK7	0596005393	412538742	JavaServer Faces	Books	3	11	13	N	N	Technical JSF reference...	If you like Hans Bergsten's JavaServer Pages, you'll like this book.  It follows the same writing style and format, with a large Appendix which contains the JSF APIs and technical information.  If you prefer your documentation in book form rather than online, the appendices are a great reference tool, but it would have been nice if they had an index or some page-edge indicators to make finding what you're looking for a little easier.  The APIs tend to get lost in the text and it's easy to flip back and forth several times until you find what you're looking for.  Personally, I would have preferred to see more examples in the reference sections.<br />I would highly suggest downloading the examples, which made the text (at least for me) a lot easier to follow.  The examples require Tomcat 5, Servlet 2.4, JSP 2.0.  If you'd like to get this working with an earlier version of Tomcat, Servlet and JSP spec, you can do it, but you're on your own.<br />The target audience as defined at the beginning of the book is divided into three roles and talks about covering the tasks for each of these roles.  The roles are &quot;page author&quot;, &quot;application developer&quot;, and &quot;component writer&quot; - the component writer being the link between the HTML and the Java code.  So, depending on what part of JSF you would be involved with, it should cover your area of expertise.	2004-06-09
US	48724135	RU1UB6D5AOF4I	0596005016	829816901	Inside .Mac: Making the Most of Your .Mac Membership	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Great .Mac Companion	From setting up your .Mac account to blogging with iBlog, this book will help you get the most out of your .Mac membership.  There are a lot of screenshots which make it easy to follow as it covers each of the .Mac services.  If you are new to .Mac, this is worth a read.  If you have some family or friends who have recently been convinced to make the switch to the Mac, this is a great way to introduce just how cool and easy to use Mac apps are.  Publishing a professional-looking homepage with one click will always get a &quot;Wow!&quot;.<br />There is a nice description of the Backup utility and I also liked the appendix, which has a list of the keyboard shortcuts for the apps you'll use with .Mac, common iDisk errors and the descriptions of those errors, and how to set up the Window's iDisk Utility.<br />If I were to add anything to this book, it would be to distinguish between tips for beginners and tips for the advanced users.  While I think launching Terminal is enough to scare my mom away from trying to set up the Virex scanner to run as a cron job, it would have been nice if this info was under some kind of &quot;For Advanced Users&quot; heading.	2004-06-09

You have a Mac, you have iPhoto 4, and you have a digital camera.  This book will help you get the most out of all three.  I was pleased to find a wide variety of hints, tips and advice covering all skill levels.  My favorite tip was how to view the invisible PDF that is submitted to the Photo Book printer.  If you plan on publishing a Photo Book, this tip alone pays for the price of the book in peace of mind.<br />The book is divided into four sections: how to take pictures, editing your pictures in iPhoto, sharing your pictures with iPhoto, and finally &quot;iPhoto Stunts&quot;.<br />The first section has little to do with iPhoto and more to do with helping you do everything you can to get the best pictures possible before loading them into iPhoto.  There wasn't anything really new here that you wouldn't find in any decent book on how to take good pictures, but it is handy to have it all in one book...  You don't need an extra book on the basic rules to taking good pictures.<br />The next section describes the iPhoto library, where it keeps the files, what happens when you crop, retouch, enhance, or use the other simple editing tools.  It notes that iPhoto is not for serious photo editing and points out a few other products that would be better suited for advanced editing.  The step-by-step descriptions for each of the editing tools included with iPhoto are very easy to understand and follow.<br />The following section describes the many ways iPhoto helps you share your pictures.  Among them are printing pictures, sending them to Apple for printing, creating a slideshow, publishing to a personal web site or to your .Mac account, creating a Photo Book, creating a Quicktime movie or an iDVD slideshow.  There are plenty of screenshots and information for each of these, so you won't get lost between each step.<br />The last section is comprised of tips and tricks to satisfy your inner-geek; how to export pictures to your PDA, how to get pictures from your cameraphone, and several AppleScript tricks.  There are also excellent tips on how to burn a CD or DVD to share with your family and friends running Windows.  There is also an appendix that covers each iPhoto menu option individually and a troubleshooting section on common problems.<br />A very well done book - it really is &quot;The book that should have been in the box&quot;., and several AppleScript tricks.  There are also excellent tips on how to burn a CD or DVD to share with your family and friends running Windows.  There is also an appendix that covers each iPhoto menu option individually and a troubleshooting section on common problems.<br />A very well done book - it really is &quot;The book that should have been in the box&quot;.	2004-06-04
US	48724135	R2QNX2SI9WNEW8	0596006845	452550561	Word Pocket Guide: A Quick Reference to Common Tasks	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Helpful companion to Word	Helpful companion to Word<br />I got this book hoping to understand why Word does some of the things it does and how to do something about it.  As I thumbed through it, I was drawn immediately to the &quot;Most Common Word Complaints&quot; section which matched a few of my gripes and explained exactly how to turn them off (automatically creating numbered lists, popup balloons).  This book helps find where in the multitude of menus you need to go to set up Word to suit your personal tastes, which for me has not been that easy to find using Word Help.<br />In my case, moving from Word 97 to Word 2002 introduced a lot of new &quot;features&quot; that (for me) just got in the way, such as the &quot;Paste Options&quot; icon that appears after you paste something into the document and the &quot;Reviewing&quot; bubbles that show up in the document if tracking changes is on.  In this pocket guide, it was easy to locate exactly what I was looking for and adjust Word to suit my preferences.  To locate anything, I would scan through the index looking for key words and then jump to that page.  I think this guide complements Word Help quite well.<br />A quick note from a Windows user at work and a Mac user at home:  This Word guide is for the Windows versions and doesn't mention anything about Word for the Mac platform.  However, almost everything in the guide will translate to Word for Mac, you just have to hunt around a little more.	2004-05-26
US	48724135	RQH8X61GZR5GH	0596006411	538300457	Eclipse	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Great introduction to Java development with Eclipse	If you use Eclipse or any of the expanding list of products based on Eclipse, this book should be on your short list.  It is easy to read and follow as the author explains in detail each of the core features which are common across all derivations of Eclipse.  The book is geared toward Java developers and will be of limited use to developers who wish to use Eclipse for other languages (which the author essentially admits on page one).  It lives up to the claim found in the preface: &quot;It's a programmer-to-programmer book, written to bring you up to speed in Eclipse without wasting time.&quot;<br />If you are new to Eclipse, I would definitely recommend this book.  It's a great &quot;bring you up to speed&quot; book.  There are a lot of screenshots and code examples to move you through each of the basic features:  how to create, debug, test (with JUnit), use source control (with CVS) and build (with Ant).<br />Depending on how familiar you are with Eclipse (I have been using Eclipse for a couple years), this may not be the book for you.  The first hundred pages or so will likely not be anything new - although, I did have an &quot;Oh, yeah - Scrapbook Pages!&quot; moment.  If you are interested in using SWT, Tomcat, Struts or Eclipse plug-in development, keep in mind this is more of a &quot;bring you up to speed&quot; than a detailed &quot;how to&quot; description of these topics.	2004-05-25
