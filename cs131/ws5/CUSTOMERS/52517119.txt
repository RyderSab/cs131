This first person account of an adult survivor of a parent with Munchausen bt proxy is riveting like a train wreck. Some parts are so hard to read, but it is impossible to stop. Julie Gregory gives and unflinching and sometimes unemotional account of the abuse she suffered at the hand of her mother. The final pages are more representative of how she really seems to feel. An interesting novel about a very rare and often missed mental illness of a parent which manifests itself on their child.	2005-03-04

I'll admit that I was a little disappointed in the story line of this novel as this not the best Kava book I've read; I figured out what was really going on halfway through, but it's still an entertaining book, and the character Maggie is always well polished and interesting, regardless of the plot. Maggie's relationship with her mother is explored in this novel, and some very interesting truths about her past come to light.  Even with the plot being a bit \\"loose\\", and easy to figure out, the book was still enjoyable, as all Alex Kava novels are.	2005-03-04

For the reader, this novel is so well writtten that in the early stages of the book, her downward spiral is heart-wrenching. But readers, please stick with this book. Sophie does eventually pick herself up, find talents and strengths she never dreamed of, and most importantly, she finds that there are others who need help more than she. To fill her time, and stave off her loneliness, she volunteers to be a \\"Big Sister\\", and meets a rebellious, jaded teenager named Christine, not the soft, cuddly toddler she had envisioned. But Christine proves to be the perfect match for Sophie, showing her that there is more than one type of loss and that some grief comes from living rather than dying. Other characters, such as Sophie's long-time friend and former college roommate, Ruth, as well as Sophie's mother-in-law, Marion, both women that Sophie had perceived as \\"perfect\\", in time show their foibles.  And then there is Drew, a handsome actor in the local theatre who could either mend or break Sophie's heart.      This is an incredible first novel, with wonderful imagery, thought provoking insights and a satisfying ending, which is filled with realistic optimism, rather than fairytale perfection.    I can't wait to read Lolly Winston's sophomore novel!	2005-03-04

Having read Traci Lords' autobiography, and being very disappointed by it,  I was a little wary when I heard that Jenna Jameson was writing one too. But after seeing her on The E! I couldn't wait for the book!    Jenna Jameson gives the most honest, humorous, tragic, erotic, and yes sometimes repulsive insight into the life of porn star.  She has a \\"no-holds barred\\", \\"no-excuses\\" attitude which makes the novel the success that it is.    Who hasn't wondered why a girls gets into the porn industry? And who hasn't wondered how they deal with that life, how it affects them, and how they can ultimately find their way out of it in one piece?  Jenna answers all of these questions and MORE.     She doesn't \\"blame\\" anyone for her choice to go into the porn industry, although she doesn't simply recommend it for everyone either.  She tells about the good times and the bad times in equal measure, and is very open and her relationships, and how her line of work affected them. She also discusses her bisexual relationships with the same \\"no excuses, no regrets\\" attitude.    Although I can understand how some people might find parts of the book shocking, my hat is off to Jenna for giving an honest look at her life.  She knows when to laugh at herself also, and although she does take herself very seriously, she does this is in a very honest way, not like a primadonna.     The sections of the novel in which Jenna, her father and brother share memories are very interesting, as they give the reader insight into the lack of stability,cohesion and communication which left Jenna so vulnerable at a very early age.    I highly recommend this book. Whether you approve of pornography or not, I think you will close the book feeling more respect for Jenna Jameson that you would ever have imagined possible.	2004-10-18

Kate Denby, the central character, as a previous  reviewer mentioned, really is too young to realistically have made it where she is in her career and her life. <br /> <br />Also her wishy-washy fastasizing between Noah and Seth goes against the grain of the rest of her personality, which is portrayed as very determined and clear-headed. <br /> <br />Finally, the character of the man who is stalking her is simply ridiculous and doesn't \\"fit\\" within the framework of the story. Perhaps that was the author's intention: in a novel of modern science and conspiracies, to have a very spiritually \\"evil\\" villain, but it just doesn't work. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of Iris Johansen, but this novel, while mildly entertaining, was not up to her typical cutting-edge, mysteries with crisp well-defined and realistic characters.  <br />	2004-10-11

Written by Renate Dorrestein, one of Holland's best-loved and decorated novelists, this English translation of \\"A Heart of Stone\\" is a poignant, shocking, yet unflinching look at the effects of mental illness, it's devastating potential and it's aftermath. <br /> <br />In this novel, Ellen, the central character toggles from the present back into the past 25 years ago to tell the story of how tragedy struck her family. In the present, Ellen struggles to come to grips on the reality of what happened to her family, while just a strongly struggling NOT to remember it. In the past narration, Ellen describes her mother's descent into severe mental illness, and how everyone around the family seems to uncomfortable or unable to do realize what is happening to her children. <br /> <br />I can't say too much about the story without giving away the plot, but I have to tell you that I read it in just a few hours. Once I had been given a \\"teaser\\" about the family's past, I had to keep reading. This novel IS disturbing, and does not pull any punches in detailing the helplessness children feel when their parents fail them so hideously. <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone who reads this novel not being moved enought to post a review about it. It's simply that powerful. <br /> <br />	2004-09-19

This novel is not written at all in Dean Koontz' typical voice, but for that reason, perhaps, it is even more compelling! I had just completed \\"False Memory\\" also by Mr. Koontz, and began reading this novel, and the differences in writing style only serve to highlight the author's uncanny abilities!    The central character who is named Odd Thomas, is such a heart-warming, quirky character, that you will fall in love with him immediately. Of course, no Dean Koontz novel would be complete without some darkness, and this novel delivers this on more than one level.  Odd, must try to save the town he lives in from a horrible massacre-to-be that only he is aware of.    It is obvious that the novel was written with the current state of humanity [or inhumanity] of the world in mind, but it this theme is so well couched within the character, Odd, that is doesn't come off sounding \\"preachy\\".      Odd is just that,a very odd young man, and seems to be, although very intelligent, somewhat naive and untouched by the harsher elements of the world, even though he comes in close contact with them. He possesses a sixth sense which allows him to communicate with the dead who often appear to him, so that he can bring to light the circumstances of their death, thus freeing them to \\"move on.\\"    His dream of graduating from his current position as a short order cook to a tire salesman makes the reader feel pity for him, but by the end of the novel, after the secrets of his childhood are revealed, there is only awe for this character who is so pure of heart.     I read this novel in one day! I found its style a bit unusual at first.....then simply magnetic! Warning: It doesn't have a perfectly happy ending that we often see from Dean Koontz, but for some reason, that simply makes the novel that much more compelling.	2004-09-19

I bought \\"The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters: A Novel\\" on a whim, from one of my book clubs, not really knowing what to expect. I was, at first, a bit put off because of the writing style [the entire book is written in the form of letters, faxes, and e-mails]. After reading about 5 pages I was hooked! Halfway through this book, I turned back to the opening pages to assure myself that it book was indeed fiction.       The main character, Olivia, is so refreshingly human in her responses to finding out that her sister Maddie has cancer, and the events chronicled are so real, it was hard to believe that the author was not writing from experience. Olivia, is a producer and has worked very hard to make a life in Hollywood, where she is hanging onto her career and her relationships by a thread. She is contemplating suicide [not very seriously] when she receives the call from home that her younger sister, Maddie has Leukemia, so she returns home, to the place she has worked so hard to get away from. Her relationships with her mother, father and brother are wonderfully portrayed and are delightfully fresh because of their honesty. Olivia's rollercoaster of emotions in response to Maddie's illness are right on the money. Keep the tissues handy...many passages will bring on the tears simply because they mirror so accurately, the horrors and reality of terminal illness, as well as the helplessness of loved ones.       Even so, this novel is not a \\"downer\\". Olivia is such an interesting character, and her manner sometimes so brash, that there are enough laughs in the novel to help lighten things up.     I will admit that reading \\"The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters\\" was difficult for me at times, as I lost my best friend to cancer recently. Having been down that road with my friend, I was astounded by the novel's authenticity in portraying the treatments involved with this disease, as well as the responses of Olivia, her parents and brother, to the process. In many ways, I felt as if I were reliving my experience along with Olivia.       This novel is unflinching in its glimpse into the way people handle terminal illnesses, as well as how they handle their relationships in general. If \\"The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters\\" is any indication of Elisabeth Robinson's talent as a novelist [she already has some impressive producing and screenwriting credits], readers are in for a treat when she writes her next novel.	2004-07-23

I began reading &quot;Innocence&quot; and after the first 30 pages or so, I was trying to reconcile in my mind whether or not the storyline was a dream. So....I started over and began reading this book again, WITHOUT my intellectual predilection to examine and &quot;prove&quot; every detail in a novel.  That's the whole point of this novel, as &quot;Beckett&quot; the main character herself mentions several times, that her view is not believed by those around her. She is a teenager who has recently lost her mother in an accident and is facing womanhood, moving to a new school, where she doesn't fit in, dealing with her father's new romance with the school nurse.  The actual events of the novel, while I never had a strong feel for whether or not they were real, as Beckett says, were &quot;true.&quot;  I think that this novel is as another reviewer said, mostly allegorical, and that the entire point is to look through the eyes of Beckett, as she struggles to process momentous changes in her life.  After I read the book [in one sitting, by the way] and closed the cover, my thoughts were just as Beckett said...It doesn't matter if it was real, it was true...  This book is not for everyone, I will concede that point. It is filled with so much imagery and the fantastical thoughts of a teenage girl in turmoil that it is impossible to tell which parts are truly supposed to be real. But after reading it, well, it doesn't really matter. I was entertained, and concerned, because I agree that there is great disolutionment in our youth. This book points that out so well.	2004-04-11

When Maggie, a housewife and mother of two children, and Alex and archeologist, move into a new home, Maggie longs to uncover and use the old fireplace in the house, so Alex pries away its boarded covering to expose the long unused fireplace.  While a chimney sweep is cleaning the chimney, he finds a diary hidden inside.  Maggie claims the diary and begins to read the over 100 year old book. She discovers that the author is &quot;Bella&quot;. She first suspects that Bells was simply an herbalist, but quickly discovers that she was a witch who lived in the house over a hundred years before.  <br />Bound by her husband's lack of respect for her and her dreams [he forbids her to return to school to study psychology, wanting her to be a &quot;proper mother], and the duties of mothering, Maggie searches for her identity by reading the diary and learning more about the remedies and potions described within. <BR>Unable to find all of the herbs mentioned, or to understand the old English words for some of them, she engages the help of a local herbalist, Ash, who has a shop in town.  She develops a strong bond with Ash, who is concerned for Maggies zeal to dive in too quickly to the potions and magic described in Bella's diary.  He sends Maggie to &quot;Liz&quot; a strange old woman who lives alone and who is quite obviously a witch.  Liz shares her knowledge with Maggie, but holds back a secret that is later revealed in the novel.<br />As Maggie becomes more and more involved in witchcraft, the time she spends away from home and her children becomes a sore point between she and her husband, Alex, who would prefer that she sit at home, minding the children all day.  <br />Also, as Maggie reads further, she discovers that Bella has a &quot;dark sister&quot; mentioned only as &quot;A&quot; in the diary, whom she accuses of causing her to do things that she doesn't want to.  Bella becomes increasing paranoidand frightened in her diary and Maggie wants to find out why.<br />She tries the potions and finds out things about Alex which, coupled with  his jealousy of her new hobby and her time away, prompts a serious rift in the marriage, as Alex is completely absorbed in a new area of the dig, which is producing some very exciting and disturbing finds. This dig is an area, coincidentally, which Maggie herself suggested that he might find something.<br />Maggie continues to move too quickly into the world of Wicca, and on the brink of losing her children and her sanity, comes to a discovery of the true story of Bella and her dark sister. <br />The story of Bella and her dark sister is so moving and sad, and speaks so well of human ignorance.  The novel ends well, and I felt that loose ends were well tied up.  I especially loved the way the novel was written, in terms of the speech used by the Bella, and old Liz.  <br />This is a wonderfully entertaining novel, which explores both Wicca, it's past, and equality in relationships.  Enjoy!	2004-04-10

I was prepared to read a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; ghost story. I had not read any reviews, having simply picked this book up at a library sale.  <BR>The main character Cookson Selway, an early-retired restauranteur and his wife Ellen, who is a fiction writer travel to England after their daughter goes away to boarding school.  Note that this novel is written in what I call &quot;Conversation Form&quot;, that is to say that it is written as if the central character, &quot;Cook&quot; is talking to the reader. Prior to leaving American, Cook has an unusual experience which reminds him of a somewhat &quot;psychic&quot; ability he had as a child. A self-described ex-addict [drugs, alcohol] Cook has not had these experiences for years, yet after this daughter leaves for school he has an incident and chalks it up to anxiety over the separation.  When he and Ellen travel to England and settle in a very old flat, things begin to get very out of control for Cook. He begins to see and hear things that no one else can see.  He strikes up an unusual friendship and bond with Paschal, the hotel's young porter and begins to distance himself from his wife.  There are some very spooky appearances, which Cook seems to take in stride and embrace in an obsessive manner which creates a terrific strain on his marriage.  There is quite a bit of soul-searching by the main character in this novel, therefore creating a story-within-a-story feel to the novel.  A final tragedy finally breaks the obsession Cook has with &quot;helping&quot; the apparitions he encounters and the novel resolves from there. There is a bit of back-tracking in the beginning of the novel, which is truly important later in the story, and the conversational writing style takes a few pages to get used to but overall, this is a very interesting novel, not at tall typical of any ghost story I have ever read. It is much more and wellworth reading.	2004-04-07

Having read &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; I wondered if Dan Brown would measure up for me in his other works. I bought a copy of Angels and Demons and I was not disappointed.  Robert Langdon, professor and symbologist is introduced to us in this novel. Robert is awakened in the middle of the night, and practically ordered to come to Europe, lured by the a grisly fax which reels him with one word &quot;Illuminati&quot;.  The Illuminati were a group of scientists vilifed by the Catholic Church hundreds of years ago, and believed to be an extinct group.  Robert is mesmerized and boards a super-sonic plane to  a high-tech scientific research corporation.  From this point forward, the novel progresses at breakneck speed as Robert, along with the help of an interesting female character named Vittoria, [who has a huge stake in the outcome of the novel] literally race against time to save Vatican City. Together they must travel to Vatican City and attempt to follow an ancient &quot;map&quot; to the person responsible for a threat to destroy Vatican City with a weapon of science - anti-matter.  Although there is plenty of suspense, treachery, and violence in this novel, I felt strong undercurrent of faith, not in any specific religious dogma, but just simple, human faith.  This is a very well written novel with so many twists and turns, the reader has to turn really immerse him or herself into the book. The character, Robert Langdon has such terrific appeal in this novel as well as &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; because he is written to be so very human. He makes mistakes, he doubts himself, he continues forward when there seems to be no hope. He make us WANT him to succeed! The surprise ending is a good one, that I did not guess.  Bear with the background information at the beginning. It does read a bit slow, but once events begin to unfold, this novel is unstoppable! I look forward to more Dan Brown novels with Robert Langdon as the central character. This is the kind of character you will fall in love with and want to read about more and more.	2004-04-07

It is after all, a short story, revisiting Lythande the sorcerer/magician, and not a huge novel in and of itself.<br />This novel is a really fun read, because it gives the reader a glimpse of Marion Zimmer Bradley's world, but does so with a bit of humor.  &quot;Gratitude of Kings&quot; is full of symbolism, and I feel that the book's message is very clear. <br />This is simply a delightful, &quot;not too deep&quot; novel, and for those unaccustomed to MZB's work, a quick look at her ability to make fantasy completely believable, and another of her fine offerings which focus around the power of women, whatever form that power may take!	2004-03-28

She writes with such candor about her experience, the reader actually feels her pain and confusion.  She handles her parents' inability to help her deal with  her brother's death with great compassion by detailing how each of them is so profoundly affected by a loss that they cannot understand, accept or find spiritual comfort for.  Alison's growth through adolescence is masterfully represented, as is her very tastefully written realization of her sexual orientation.  <br />Alison's confusion at the loss of her brother, brush with an eating disorder, and guilt at being the one left behind are written without the least bit of self-pity, which makes her story even more moving. <br />As other readers have remarked, I would really like to know more about how Alison fared after her graduation from high school [the informational portion of the novel ends at this stage in her life].  <br />Very clearly, she has found some sort of peace with her brother's death and for our benefit, has been able to write a very powerful memoir of the struggles she encountered dealing with grief, loss, her spirituality, and \\"coming of age\\".<br />This is a  great \\"book club book\\", as there are many topics open for discussion.  <br />A wonderful novel which you will read and most importantly, remember, long after you have turned the last page!	2004-03-28

The novel has been incorrectly marketed. Perhaps that is because the publishers weren't sure exactly how to market it.  <br />The novel begins with Ta-Thea an empress barely escaping her home land after her husband, the emperor of Shinabar and her son are murdered in an uprising.  The first few pages do indeed seem like a fantasy novel, but as one continues to read on, the novel is simply a broad mix of characters and situations which symbolize a woman's search for spiritual enlightment.  Tathea is trusted with a mysterious &quot;Book&quot; which is said to completely explain God's plan for mankind. <br />To be perfectly honest, the book was a bit too long, and the characters, with their unusual &quot;fantasy&quot; names, were simply players to point out good and evil, accepting the law of God or not, and how they related to Tathea's quest to share her new-found knowledge of God with others.<br />The book is not the best I've ever read, and I have to admit that I struggled through it.  Using unusual names and exotic locations, Ann Perry's publishers have attempted to pass this book off as a fantasy work. This novel would be much better accepted by the public if it were simply marketed more truthfully.  I was disappointed, and am now sorry that I bought the sequel, &quot;Come Armageddon&quot; before I had finished reading &quot;Tathea.&quot;  <br />If you do plan to buy this book, expect an introspective novel which looks very closely at the frailties of human beings and how they react to spirituality.  If you are expecting traditional fantasy fiction, you will be disappointed.	2004-03-22

I bought this book expecting, not a fast-paced novel, but an introspective look at a woman in pain over her fractured family. This book is not an introspective, it is a hodge-podge of fractured thoughts, conversations, images, and self-acknowledgements.  The book annoyingly begins with the heroine of the story Reta Winters, who is an author [gasp] reciting every book she has published. The soon to be ever-present Danielle Westerman, Reta's friend or object of obsession, depending on how you read into it, makes her debut in these pages, because most of Reta's published work involves translations of  Danielle's work.  Why do we need to know what Reta Winters has written?  The boring, self-absorbed tone of these first few pages should have been a red flag for me, but I had been hooked by the first pages, and wanted to know what had caused Reta's self-described &quot;period of great unhappiness.&quot;  When I learned in later pages that her eldest daughter, Norah had removed herself from normal life, and was living on the streets, I was intrigued and wanted to find out more. <br />What a mistake....<br />The bits and pieces scattered through the novel that actually tell the story of where Norah is and why are simply morsels to keep one reading a tortuously laborious novel.  Reta goes on and on about topics that are fragmented and seem to have no relation to one another.  Imagine your everyday thoughts, random as they can be, written down and passed off for a novel. That is what &quot;Unless&quot; has to offer.  I found the all too frequent references to the great Danielle Westerman [I could never understand why she was such a figure of worship for the main character...] are annoying and distracting.  <br />I read hundreds of books each year and don't give up easily on a novel, but I found myself skipping large sections of this novel, looking for the name &quot;Norah&quot; so that I could get back to the story line.  <br />I do realize that this novel is supposed to be about what goes on in Reta Winters' mind as she goes through such a painful event as a daughter who has turned her back on life, but I lost patience with Reta's self-absorption. <br />If I spent as much time self-obsessing and Danielle Westerman-obsessing, as this character does, I would never accomplish anything.  <br />I would not recommend this novel to anyone, unless you are prepared to waste your money, your time, and end up frustrated by the loss of both.	2004-02-29

It really is more of a detective story, with the main character in the present pursuing the truth surrounding a 100 year old multiple murder and suicide. The narration by Eleanor, the ghost who is trapped in Five Mile House was a nice twist from the normal &quot;ghost story.&quot; Leslie Stone, the main character of this novel, has an unexplained connection with Eleanor Bly, who committed murder and  suicide 100 years before.  That connection was never fully explained. <br />I found the storyline of an entire town filled with practicing wiccans a bit far-fetched, as was the premise that Leslie's husband would bring her to this place after she has been through an experience which has made her doubt her sanity. The reason [I won't give the plot away] for Leslie's temporary insanity leaves one to believe that her husband is either an idiot or completely insensitive to bring her to Wellington, the fictional town where Five Mile House is located.  <br />As Leslie learns that her children are in danger, she is called to make a decision that on the surface proves her unconditional love for her children. Then the last page of the book leaves the reader feeling that certainly Leslie cannot truly love her children based on the choice she makes. <br />Her relationships with her husband and her lover are both bizarre and devoid of communication, and that is a bit disappointing.  <br />Eleanor's account of how her children really died and the horrific events that led up to their deaths was truly heartwrenching, even if the reason for all of the diabolical scheming to drive her to her course of action was &quot;over the top.&quot;<br />Overall, this was an interesting book, and it was entertaining, but when I finished the novel, I had a completely different feeling about Leslie Stone than I had through the entire novel.  <br />I suppose it is afterall, not a fairytale, therefore one should not expect a fairytale ending.	2004-02-26
US	52517119	R1T6LQ1R3T7KJM	0399151273	890960277	Retribution	Books	5	3	5	N	N	An unusual twist!	I had never heard of Jilliane Hoffman, but bought \\"Retribution\\" based on a book store review. I wasn't disappointed. The novel tells the story of a high-powered prosecutor who has pulled her life together after a decades-old brutal rape and slashing, only to find herself face to face with her rapist again when he is accused of a string of serial murders.  Having changed her name and her looks, \\"Chloe\\", now CJ, wonders if he recognizes her.  She must decide whether to remove herself from the case to avoid a conflict of interest, or stay in and fight to put him away forever.  Ms. Hoffman gives an inside look at the struggles of a victim of violence and how it affects every aspect of their life.  There is nice \\"love interest\\" in the story also, which helps to break the unrelenting tension of this novel.  The twist at the end is somewhat expected, but still keeps the reader riveted until the very end.  I wondered if any other readers noticed that the sewing up of the details left a little room for suspicion that there could be a sequel to this novel?  ****WARNING SLIGHT PLOT GIVEAWAY INT THIS PARAGRAPH*** I wondered about the anonymous caller, who is revealed near the end.  Of course we know HOW he knew was Bill Bantling was doing, but wasn't he supposed to report what he knew?  Also, if he didn't because he was insane and had other plans for the future, how could he so completely copycat Bantling's crimes? How do we know for sure that it was Bantling he was copycatting?*****<br />Overall, a GREAT read, I couldn't put this book down, the courtroom drama was great, the characters were solid and human, and I look forward to Ms. Hoffmans's next offering.	2004-02-21
US	52517119	RWPZAB4XQNQUJ	0375412115	736155299	Our Lady of the Forest	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Unsatisfying...	I hate to throw &quot;cold water&quot; on other happier reviewers, but I read 5-10 books per month and I hate to waste my reading time. I felt that I wasted time on this book.  Although David Guterson's insight into the life and doubts of a priest was very well written, the choppy, unpunctuated dialogue was hard to follow.  The main character Anne, was so sketchy that it was hard to determine what she was really all about.  The storyline is intriguing...an appearance of the Virgin Mary to a non-Catholic teenaged runaway with no religious training, but the novel failed to deliver the goods. Ultimately, we are left to our own assumptions about whether or not Ann was the real thing, and perhaps that is the point, that all faith is just that. But the lack of fleshing out of characters, coupled with the odd writing style, especially in terms of the dialogue made me long for the end of the novel, and not in a good way.  I kept hoping that SOMETHING would happen, but the &quot;something&quot; that did was just so abrupt that it didn't pack the punch it could have. I wouldn't recommend this book, unless you have time to kill and don't mind a lot of &quot;loose ends&quot; in your fictional reading.	2004-01-13

It starts with a hook that makes you simply HAVE to turn the pages. The character development is as always with Mr. Kellerman, superb!  As in any series, it is always great to revisit &quot;old friends&quot; in terms of the main characters, and learn new things about them. This book has a great beginning, middle and end...what more can you ask for? I don't give out plot information in my reviews, I only say that this book is definitely a must-have for any Kellerman fan or any suspense novel fan as well. Kudos to Kellerman!	2004-01-13

Having read literally thousands of books, I am always delighted with a fresh, new idea.  Narrated by one of the two central characters, Leeann Norris, the much younger sister of Beth Ann Norris, this story tells many tales, all interwoven, which speak volumes about the complexity of human relationships.  Mary Beth Norris is a &quot;song reader&quot;. She is able to help the people in her small town work out their problems by making charts of the songs that they listen to, the songs that stick in their minds, and remind them of both good times and bad.  She and her younger sister Leeann live alone, having lost both of their parents through very different circumstances. Leeann looks up to her sister and is in awe of her &quot;gift&quot;. Her character expresses all of the difficulties of growing up in a small town, and being just a little different from other people. She has lots of questions about her father, her mother and her early years, but somehow the reader gets the feeling that she is not ready for the answers in the beginning of the novel. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but Leeann is forced to take on a grown up level of responsibility when Mary Beth is suddenly unable to, and this is when many of her questions begin to be answered. She struggles with her family history: the mysteries for which there are no answers, and the lies she has been told &quot;out of love.&quot;  This novel is an excellent example of very well fleshed out characters who deal with adversity in the best way they know how and don't always make the right choices.  The book also touches on mental illness in the most respectful way I have seen in a fiction novel.  It's a wonderful novel.... a must read.... I finished it in one day!!!  Once you read the first page you will be hooked!  I see the possiblity of a sequel, which would be nice, but I'm also really excited to read Ms. Tucker's next novel when it is finished. I suspect we'll be hearing a lot from her in the future!	2003-08-09
US	52517119	R2G8M3EE7UGKOL	1573229350	768388033	Best Friends	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A realistic look af friendship	I liked this book, for the exact same reasons that others who reviewed it did not.  Although there are many women who have the type of best friend with whom they share every detail of their lives, there are just as many who love each other so much that they honor the idea of keeping secrets from each other. In contrast to an earlier reviewer's experience, my very best friend and I were inseparable from the age of 5, but we could not have been more different, and there were things I never knew about her until she was terminally ill. Only then  did she feel that she could/should share certain \\"secrets\\" with me.  This book is a testament to the fact that not all women \\"tell all\\" even to their best friends.  The two main characters, Clare and Sally, although very different in temperament and social upbringing, are very similar in their inability to develop deep emotional ties. Sally seeks to fill her emptiness by having children and avoiding unpleasantness, while Clare seeks to fill hers by surrounding herself with the cold reality of death in her work with AIDS patients, and in relationships with men she cannot have. Both are deeply scarred and  shaped by their childhood experiences, and this book explores the effects of poor parenting in an unflinching manner. I enjoyed the book, although I would have preferred a more concrete ending. For a first novel, it is quite good, and I would certainly recommend it. It would make a great book for a women's book club, for I would imagine the debating about the depth of the character's devotion to each other and what they \\"should\\" have shared would be a hot topic!	2003-05-17

I've always been a fan of Mr. Patterson's and I'll admit that after reading the jacket of this book, I had my doubts about whether or not I'd find this novel believable... 10 pages into the novel, I had no doubts!  I read the novel in one afternoon because it lived up to the \\"can't put it down\\" description that so many novels claim.  The characters were wonderfully developed, and watching the change in Katie's feelings as she gets to \\"know\\" Suzanne through the diary was a masterful study in human behavior and emotion. Matt's tormented character could pluck the heartstrings of the most jaded reader, and Suzanne....well, you just have to read the book to understand her part in this novel. I laughed, I cried, but most of all I thoroughly enjoyed this novel!  I was so impressed with Mr. Patterson's ability to write in the person of a female with such completely convincing authenticity!  To sum it up: BUY THIS BOOK!!! Or borrow it....whatever you need to do to read it....You won't regret it!	2002-07-31

Heaven and Earth, the second installment in the Three Sisters Island Trilogy by Nora Roberst is even better than the first book.  Again, Wicca is a large part of this novel and will give witches a good name!  The supernatural scenes are well written and as believable as you can get. Ripley Todd is forced to face her gift of witchcraft and to face her destiny as well. Her struggle with both makes for interesting reading indeed.  Mia and Nell return and we find out much more about the reasons for Mia and Ripley's feud. Mac, Ripley's love interest in this novel, is a wonderfully quirkly character, and one you'll want to push her toward as you read this novel.  As with the first installment, the romantic scenes are a little heavy-handed and do put the women in a somewhat subservient role, which is hard to believe of Ripley by the very nature of her character. Still, it's fun to watch her let herself be weak and trusting. Overall, a great read that will leave you waiting for the final installment.	2002-06-23

Just when you think you have this novel figured out, Michael Connelly throws another curve ball so efficiently that you'll feel as if the wind has been knocked out of you! Add to that the wonderful central character who is delightfully unsure of his decisions, supporting characters who act and react so unlike one would expect, and you have the perfect mix for a suspenseful &quot;who-dunnit and why?&quot; Mr. Connelly has a way of pulling the reader into the story and making them want to know what happened to the little boy who ended up in a shallow grave so many years ago.  What a great read, and the ending will surprise you... Kudos to Michael  Connelly!	2002-06-23

This, the first installment in Nora Robert's Three Sisters Island Trilogy will satisfy any fan of romance fiction. Also, she will gain a new following because of the subject matter which is central to the story, namely witchcraft. We're not talking about old hags with warts on their noses here either! These are modern day women who live very modern lives, but also are practitioners of &quot;The Craft.&quot;  This novel is a very positive one for fans of Wicca, as there is often reference to the adage &quot;Do no harm&quot;, as well as the women having to restrain from using their power for personal gain or when they simply know that they should let nature take it's course. Nell is a captivating character, seeking to find her own power, both as a woman and to her surprise as a witch.  She finds her way from a loveless, abusive marriage to Three Sisters Island and makes new life for herself, but not without a visit from the past.  The two other strong central characters, Ripley and Mia are well developed and in some ways more interesting than Nell, and I look forward to the next two installments to find out more about them.  The novel is a bit heavy-handed when it comes to the characters swooning into the arms of handsome men, and that does seem out of character for their strength, but you'll find yourself rooting for Nell to find romance anyway!	2002-06-23

Of course I knew it had to end, but I expected something much  more climactic since Mia Devlin had been cast as the stronger of the three sisters in the first two novels. I expected her story to be the most powerful, yet ultimately I found it to be the weakest. In the beginning, her anger at Sam was interesting, and the romantic scenes in this novel were much more believable to the character than in books one and two. However, with one simple conversation, it's as if Mia says, &quot;Oh well...that's ok...the past decade is forgiven.&quot;   Just a little hard to swallow.... The joining of her power with Sam's was very believable in the early scenes, but when it comes to the ending, I guess I expected much more. Everything seemed to be over-simplified.  Still, it's worth the read, and you won't feel satisfied until you finish the trilogy if you have already read the first two books.	2002-06-23

I stumbled onto \\"The Plague Tales\\" by accident and was immediately hooked by all of the characters, especially Alejandro, who is one of the most genuinely human characters I've encountered in a fictional novel. Throughout \\"The Plague Tales\\" he struggles with the conflict between his passion for learning, devotion to medicine and his moral values. I also enjoyed the \\"future\\" characters, Dr. Janie Crowe and her assistant/friend Caroline. The only complaint I had was wanting to know more about the future characters, and I got my wish in \\"Burning Road.\\" In this sequel, we learn about the cause of \\"The Outbreaks\\" in the future and follow Janie as she trys to track the cause of a mysterious illness affecting a certain group of young boys, while dealing with her true feelings for her lover Bruce and her attorney/friend Tom. Alejandro is back, with yet more dilemas to work through, and the character Kate, his \\"adopted\\" daughter takes on  rich, deep dimensions. In both the past and future storylines, we meet new and exciting characters, revisit old characters in greater detail, and of course, encounter new enemies and dangerous situations.  In \\"Burning Road\\" the novel seems to spend more equal amounts of time between the past and the future. As with \\"The Plague Tales\\", Ms. Benson weaves past and present together in an incredibly artful and satisfying manner. This is simply a great novel, but I definitely suggest that for maximum enjoyment, one should read \\"The Plague Tales\\" first.  Also, be sure to have a copy of \\"Burning Road\\" ready, because you won't want to wait to spend more time with these characters! I'd love to read another installment to this story!	2002-02-03
US	52517119	R17QD9FY9R2EIA	0440225108	7077895	The Plague Tales	Books	4	9	10	N	N	I Couldn't Put This Book Down!	I stumbled onto &quot;The Plague Tales&quot;, having no idea what to expect, and for the most part I was pleasantly surprised. As a medical thriller, it is superb, and I read this rather long novel very quickly. Even today, centuries after it killed millions of Europeans, just hearing the words &quot;Bubonic Plague&quot; are enough to get just about anyone's attention. The descriptions of the illness are right on the money and the helplessness of physicians to realize a cause or cure add to the suspense of the story. &quot;Who will be the next character to become ill?&quot; is the question I kept wondering. This book has virtually no &quot;filler&quot;, so it reads very quickly. The switches between the 14th Century storyline and the storyline set in the future are very well placed, keeping the reader engrossed in the characters of both stories.  Janie, the main character in the future storyline, is very hardened by her losses in the &quot;Outbreaks&quot; of some sort of plague in the future. If I have a complaint, it is that those Outbreaks were never explained in the novel, even though there were ample opportunities for Janie's character to do so. It seems that the stress of the novel is based in the past, and those characters are well formed, especially Alejandro, the 14th century physician who is tormented by both his inability to cure the victims of Bubonic Plague and the many decisions he has to make during his adventures in the story. His struggles with his faith, his true identity, and his loyalties are portrayed very exceptionally well. His character is the one which I feel that most readers will bond most strongly with, as his emotions are fleshed out so well, and it is so easy to relate to the basic moral dilemas he encounters.  There are some minor discrepancies in the novel, and the link between the past and the future in the case of Caroline, Janie's assistant, is never explained (Perhaps the sequel to this novel does so), but didn't seriously mar my enjoyment of the novel. The mysterious Sarah, with her &quot;cure&quot; for Bubonic Plague, is a nice touch, and adds a bit of mysticism to the mix, as well as taking a shot at modern medicine and it's cynicism toward natural remedies. There truly is an unresolved link between the character Caroline and Sarah and that is a bit unsatisfying.  Some reviews have criticized the actions of the characters as being unbelievable, but I would think that in the face of such a rigidly controlled future world as is  described in &quot;The Plague Tales&quot;, &quot;normal&quot; actions and reactions would easily be discarded.  Overall, I highly recommend this novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it's weave of historical fact with fiction, as well as past with future events.	2002-01-05

Noah from &quot;Stealing Shadows&quot; makes an appearance, which was shorter than I would have liked (hope to read more about HIS story in the future)... but the suspense of this novel, the agonizing search for the missing woman, and the very unusual ending made for a wonderful read!!

This novel is wonderful for anyone, but especially appealing for those of us who are in book discussion clubs. The novel is open for personal interpretation on many levels. Ms. Chevalier's presentation of life in a very difficult time is tempered with one girl's strong sense of identity even as she responds to duty imposed by family hardship. There are many levels to this story, and while Griet is the main focus, the fear of Vermeer's wife and her insecurities about her place in her husband's priorities are very interesting, as is the character Vermeer himself.
