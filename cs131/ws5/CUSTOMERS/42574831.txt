Sorry, love show, but the book is just not a page turner. If you're not a fan of the show the book will only get one or two stars. The sentimental part of the book where Man Cow''s father has cancer is something everybody can relate too, sickness in the family, and you do feel what Cow is saying. The Amsterdam trip very fun reading especially if you've been to Amsterdam like I have, then you can relate just how free the people in the Netherlands are or how low. Five stars on show.	2003-07-25

According to the author the prince has all familiy ties and religious ties that will one day make him the king of Europe or the so called anti Christ. The royal emblem, according to the author is the same thing described in the Bible describing the beast in revalations. This idea was interesting. I can believe that the prince and the royal family are very corupt and involved in secret societies to manipulate the world but to go as far to say that the prince is the anti Christ, give me a brake. Although I disagreed with some of the concepts in this book, it is very  entertaining and filled with a whole lot of great informaion. This book is well worth reading.	2003-04-03

This book is boring and entertaining all at the same time, so I'll make this review short . The book will give great geological evidence of a great flood that happend some time during the last ice ages. The book is saying that there is evidence that man started civilization long before text book history say's it started, then destroyed, forcing man to start all over. Very interesting is how ancient mythology from all over the world describe a massive flood that wiped out man. One thing for sure the biblical version of the flood wasn't the first. Very interesting book worth reading but be prepared for long read.	2003-01-16

Those familiar with Icke's books will wonder what happend with the Annunaki, shape shifting, reptilian masters. Not too much of that in this book, but those familiar with this subject will not be dissappointed. This is a awesome and very entertaining book with so much information that this book will make your head spin. If a quarter of what Icke says in his books is true, humanity doesn't have a chance. The book goes on about how the Illuminati was behind the attacks on September 11th and how the bush family and administration is neck deep in the cover up to hide the truth from the public with the master goal to contol every thing through a one world government or one world order. Very scary information in this book and well worth the price.	2002-12-13

This book brings out that Tutankhamun was one of the supergods reincarnated to help mankind the way Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Pacal were. The book shows how all the supergods had many things in common, all born through immaculate conception, each associated with the sun, light,performed miracles, similar teachings, and so much more. The book brings to light many facts and speculations about the sun that are very interesting and graps your attention, how the sun affects just about everything we do, fertility in women, and history itself.The book will show why ancient cultures worshiped the sun in ways you never thought. Hard to believe King Tut was one of the so called supergods but the author does a great job with the evidence he brings out.

Atlantis most likely did not sink but was hit by a comet, which caused a catastrophic explosion, then hit by another comet close to it's waters causing a massive deluge. The amazing part is that this flood is is talked about in the Old Testament, Sumerian, Egyption, Greek, Mayan, Native American, Indian, and many other ancient cultures all over the world without having any contact with one another and having the same story about a great flood that affected the whole planet. All the evidence points to around 1200bc,a comet hit the earth causing the destruction of Atlantis. Even Plato's description point to 1200bc. When Plato talked about the time of Atlantis being 9,000 years before his time, according to the author Plato meant 900 years before his time, which makes that around 1200bc. The book brings to light the many cultures all over the world talk about a cataclysmic event that affected the whole earth, all of it sounding like the description of a comet striking the earth. This book will amaze you with all the facts the author brings to light. Great book!!!	2002-10-18

The theory that the royal familiy and people in the high ranks of politics, like American presidents are shape shifting reptilian satin worshipers from the same bloodline is just a little to hard too believe. I agree with the book that we are being controled and lied to through, banks, religion, war ect, but the only way to believe the reptilian part of the book is to see one of these things shape shift. Since Davide Icke claimes to know who these reptilan shape shifters are, he should grab one and make it shape shift on camera. That is the way to make people believe.

Every ufo buff should read this book.This book deals with what the Bible says about the so called ufos, abductions, cattle mutilation, and what the Old and New Testament say about the identity and number of ufos that will be involved in the final war the Bible says is going to happen.The first half of this book deals with intersting ufo stories of people reporting ufos and people being abducted. The first half also compares old folk stories of Fairies, Banshees, Incubus, Sucubus,and Leprechauns being described as chalky white and or stealing children, forced sex with these creatures,just like the Gray aliens in todays stories; how intersting is that! The second half of this book is when it really starts getting interesting.

This book gets into how the  Christian religion is a mix of many ancient religions like Zoroaster, Buddhaism,Mithraism, Egyption, Indian, Babylonian, and Greek religions. Just one example is: Mithra was born of a virgin, with sheperds present, Mithra was known as The Way,The truth,<BR>The Light,The Son Of God, and born on 25th of December just like many other deities with the same story that predates the Christian story.Very interesting how the author links the Egyption god Horus and Jesus with many similarities between them, and links the Christian religion with the worship of the Sun going back to the time of the Egyptions, with Horus being the savior.December 25th is the Sun being born again a Roman celebration not originaly a Christian holiday as the author said was very interesting.This book was filled with interesting and controversial facts about religion that make you think, if you want too read a more detailed version of this book I recomend: The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold By Acharya S.	2002-04-24

This book shows how all people in power through out history share the same blood line from American Presidents to the royal family that go back to the time of the Sumarians and beyond. Hard too believe but possible. The author exposes how a secret society called the Illuminati are the real power behind the throne conroling just about everything in politics, media, and big corporations to keep humans in line. The author claims people are being kept in line through imprisonment of the human mind. Rigid belief systems like Christianity,Judism,Islam, Hinduism, and all other forms of religion designed to discourage free thinking, all a creation of secret societies like the Illuminati. The Author also gets into Christ conspiracies that are very interesting and if you never read any material of this nature this stuff will blow your mind away. The author tells the story and gives proof of who and what these extraterresrials are that go back thousands of years.The author claims that the mythical Gods of old like in Sumarian writings of exraterrestial Gods called the Annunaki are of reptilian form and these are the guys that are running the whole show. The author also claims the blood line of the Annunaki and the Biblical Nephilim are same guys that interbred with human female as stated in the Bible and Sumarian scrpit, and that they share thier blood line with all are leaders through out history. When the author gets into the shape shifting part it gets a little hard too believe. He claims that some our most known leaders are shape shifters.

I think Sitchins books are great, but Sitchin has nothing new too say in this one. The writing style in this book was just flat out annoying. If you want to read a book that is more objective, read the Facade: By Michael S. Heiser or go to his web site: .... At least you can see, and judge for your self if Sitchin is on the write track. Sitchin seems to think that everything he has to say is Gospel. Sitchin might be flat out wrong.	2001-11-30
