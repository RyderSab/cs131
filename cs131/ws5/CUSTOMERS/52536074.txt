The main story about the Cafe' I found to be brilliant, very thought-provoking and somewhat enchanting.  The characters are very unusual, but the author makes them believable and makes you become emotionally part of the story. The stories that followed in this collection are all very well written, but a few lacked substance and I found some of them to be dry and disappointing as a reader in comparison to the first one in the book.  The final one in the collection was very creative and inspiring, however, and demonstrates the incredible power of this author.  A worthwhile read if you are exploring the writing of great American authors.  I enjoyed it.	2001-08-20

Who hasn't walked down a cereal isle in a grocery store and been effected one way of the other by the masterful marketing presented there?   I actually bought this book at Cereal City in Battle Creek, Michigan, the home of the cereal industry.  I immediately began reading it and could not put it down!  I never thought I would find a book about breakfast cereal to be so fascinating. These two authors deserve a great deal of credit for compiling and writing a fantastic book.

This book by Jon Spoelstra is by far the top book on marketing I have ever come across.  He brings together so many fundamental truths in this easy to read format, that you can't help but wonder: 'How come I didn't think of that?' This book is beautifully presented with clear cut anecdotes that help the reader understand the authors viewpoint on customer service, marketing and expanding a company.  Too often in America today we have the viewpoint floating around from wall street down to small business industry that `down-sizing' is pro-survival and words like `expansion' is seldom addressed as a long term solution.  I found this book to be very refreshing with intelligent solutions for business owners and marketers with struggling products.  Everyone, no matter where you are in the American business scene, can benefit from this book.  Spoelstra is a true genius and has a sincere concern for the people he works with.  He conveys a very refreshing message throughout the book that business can be fun and rewarding, and marketing is a great game for the innovative.   I simply loved this book and found myself wanting to read it again and again.   Spoelstra has worked for four different NBA franchises and he shares his battle-tested experience with taking struggling organizations and making them profitable and successful.  His words of wisdom are truly wonderful, and I know everyone who has ever been in business will thoroughly enjoy this one.  Let the bells of bright ideas start chiming!	2001-08-06

Boyington was indeed in the thick of it during the war, and to his credit he shot down 28 Japanese planes during his time in combat.  Once in a single mission, he shot down five planes over Japanese territory.  This book is an auto-biography of his time before, during and after the war.  It is quite an interesting read.  I enjoyed the pilot's viewpoint this book carries from the cockpit of a Corsair during combat.  Boyington was an incredibly adept pilot and taught the other pilots in his famous `Black Sheep Squadron' how to beat the Japanese in air combat.   Boyington describes first hand aerial dogfights over the Pacific Islands that comprised well over 100 planes at a time with the skies glowing like fire flies filled with tracer fire, a truly remarkable period in aerial combat history.  He portrays his experiences as a pilot and later as a 'Special Captive' instead of a prisoner of war, with finesse so as not to make it too heavy of a read, but it leaves the reader with a deep respect for the American service man.  During his time in a Japanese prison of war camp, his courage was undaunted and he emerged as a true American hero receiving national recognition after the war was over having won the Navy Cross and the Congressional Medal of Honor.  This book is relayed by the author in a first person narrative, and is a sincere and down to earth account of his experiences.  It is very interesting and enjoyable.	2001-06-22

The Best Yet!	`The Goblet of Fire' is book 4 in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling.  It is also the largest book to date in this series.  To fully appreciate this one, you simply must read the preceding three.  Book 4 takes a completely different turn from the first three, with an entirely unconventional year at Hogwarts.  In this book Harry Potter get exposed in a big way to the international world of wizardry by first attending the `Quidditch World Cup' and later becoming a part of a very exciting and secret competition between two other wizarding schools like Hogwarts.  The characters from preceding books are in full swing in this one, and as usual J.K. Rowling introduces even more colorful and exciting characters in this edition.  Additionally there is the alarming return of the frightening 'He who must not be named'.  There is nothing quite like the imagination of this author, it is simply wonderful and brilliant.  She really has an incredible gift for capturing the reader in the most unusual and exciting adventures.  This book has kind of a dark and scary ending, unlike the preceding three.  All the same, however,  it sets up the reader with screaming curiosity for the forth-coming book 5.  You will simply enjoy this one as the whole story broadens out to become a huge global adventure, and Harry Potter is the ultimate hero.  This series has a unique way of spanning the generations of readers, and anyone looking for something fun and entertaining to read should definitely dig into this series.  You will find yourself captured like none other with this imaginative and refreshing creation.  Further the illustrations by Mary Grandpre are just right throughout the book to keep you turning page after page.  The biggest problem with this book is that it leaves you ravenously wanting to read book 5, and it has not been released yet!  A remarkable story, and it has me totally captured!

This book is an indictment of animal experimental laboratories, slaughter houses, poaching and hunting.  Kotzwinkle uses a fast talking insane rodent to portray a macabre view of the inside of an animal experimentation laboratory grotesquely similar to a Nazi concentration camp.  In the words of Dr. Rat himself &quot;...having been driven insane, I hold the necessary degree in psychology.&quot; With this pointed statement, this bizarre story unfolds.  Kotzwinkle paints a dark and frightening tale that is a reflection of our times.  This book cuts right into the artificial and bloody foundation of Psychiatric `research' and experimentation, and the reader will be appalled at the harsh spotlight that it shines on the inhumane practices so common place in our society, yet hidden behind a paper-shuffling bureaucracy.  This is a very clever book, and very timely.  It will open anyone's eyes with its startling viewpoint.  A real shocker filled with cold realism.

I found this biography by Irving Stone to be very educational.  Darrow was involved in some of the  most famous trials around the turn of the century that defined labor laws, capital punishment laws as well as laws defining religious discrimination with the well known Scopes Evolution Case over the teaching of the Darwin theory of evolution in the classroom.  This famous case known as the `Monkey' trials pitted fundamentalists against more liberal evolutionists in a landmark case that defined freedom and equality of religious teaching throughout the United States. Darrow was a defense attorney, and his viewpoint on representing a client was to simply provide the best defense possible.  This did not always go with the popular opinion of society in his day, and he was often hated by many for some of the people he defended in the courtroom.  I think it is notable that in many of his more famous cases and not so famous he was never paid, as he defended people who had no money.  In this way he showed a compassion for his fellow man which one does not often associate with the profession of lawyers  in the modern day.  As I read this biography, I found myself many times not agreeing with Darrow's viewpoints and decisions to defend certain people, including the famous Loeb &amp; Leopold Case.  I marveled at his final solution to plead guilty in the defense of the McNamaras Case in 1911, a point of integrity after learning his client was truly guilty. This case cost his the support and friendship with organized labor parties after over thirty years, as well as resulted in a massive attack on him personally, but he weathered the storm and carried onward.  However, I was able at the end to reflect on this man's tenacity to his own integrity to follow what he believed was right, despite popular opinion.  His sense of morals were different from my own, and I would be untruthful to say I completely agreedwith Darrow.  I did however find myself respecting him for impact he had on our country's history, and his exposing of the industrial abuses that paralleled slave camps in the late 1800's definitely shined the light on man's inhumanity to man.  All in all I found this to be a very interesting biography about a very interesting man.  I think anyone interested in American history, particularly that of the history of organized labor in our country should definitely read this one.  This is a great read.  Darrow having been a well known public speaker in his day, delivered some of the most profound speaches inside and outside the courtroom. Many of his famous defense final arguments are still studied today in many law schools, but most notable is the fact that he delivered many of these speeches without the aide of notes or other written material. Many people who heard these speeches were included in this book, and consistently he is remembered as having really had a way of moving an audience and changing their viewpoints in doing so.  Irving Stone really did his background research in compiling this book, including reading many of Darrow's own private papers, court records, interviewing people who knew Darrow and studying newspapers from the time period.  I think anyone would find this book facinating from a purely historical perspective.  It is too bad this book is currently out of print, but it is worth searching used book stores or searching Amazon's out-of-print services to get a copy and read it.	2001-03-09

I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Inspiring the famous and popular movie `Field of Dreams', Kinsella spins a magical adventure that permeates throughout the American spirit.  Baseball becomes the enchanting weave of nostalgia that is carefully woven to express all that is good in life and can be again.  Magnificent dialogue between wonderful characters bring this story to life and hits a home run right into the heart of Americana.  There are more characters in the book than those that appear in the movie, and makes for wonderful mix personalities. You will love how Kinsella involves well known author J.D. Salinger in this story, and the light touch of humor surrounding difficult situations.  This story is about believing and following your heart, and achieving your dreams.  It is about all that is good in life and imploring you to take a look at it.  It lifts the reader above the day to day problems that face us all, and carries you off into a world of imagination.  Shoeless Joe the talented Left Fielder who had his career ended because of the Black Sox scandal leading to permanent ejection from the game by former baseball commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis is allowed to return at Ray Kinsella's newly crafted Iowa baseball field surrounded by a corn field.  Ray had heard a voice that instructed him to build the field, and he followed it.  The magical story unfolds from there, and grows to become a masterful blend of inspirational characters who join together to travel a journey of hope and faith in themselves and their dreams.  A simply magnificent combination of past, present and future that only Kinsella could spin.  This will certainly become a favorite of any baseball fan.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!	2001-03-06

This was the first Pat Conroy novel I had read, and I found his writing style quite refreshing.  His story about the gung-ho Marine living up to an image larger than life with the back drop of a typical military family makes for an enjoyable combination.  The `Great Santini' is a fighter pilot, and this identity permeates his entire existence, within and outside the aircraft.  His two older children Ben and Mary Anne are creatively portrayed as two teenagers coping with all the drama of a new high school and fitting in, under the shadow of a sometimes over-bearing father.  Their humor back and forth alone will leave you smiling, if not occasionally laughing aloud as they shed their views on the world around them.  Conroy's definitive portrayal of the Catholic family in the early 60's is also masterfully done, and lightly dressed with the tongue-in-cheek wit and humor that flows smoothly throughout the story.  The overall plot and story line of the book seemed at times to be drifting along heading no where in particular, but in the end it concludes with a swift dose of reality that lies waiting in the wings of all who are part of the military life.  All in all an enjoyable book that is very well written that ends in a somewhat sad, but dramatic conclusion.  The story is about growing up in a Marine family from all angles.  It was quite enjoyable and eye opening.	2001-03-05

Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well.  He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves.  He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own.    As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War.  Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota.  You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation.  Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing.  His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it.  I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book.  As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history.	2001-02-09

More specifically: DRUG MONEY.  All roads of their pseudo-science leads to an addictive America on harmful, destructive Psychiatric Drugs.

This text, along with the DSM IV TR and all subsequent revisions have one goal in mind: Make the criteria broader and broader for diagnosis, and extremely vague and cover every aspect of human behavior and label it as a 'mental disorder' thereby controlling the greatest nation on earth and making it a robotic, suggestible society under the control of their drugs.  Whenever you see these criminals in white coats, recognize them for what they are: DRUG PUSHERS!  Shred this book if you own one and read your bible, it's safer and less destructive.

This last one about a mule named Horace literally had me laughing out loud, and was worth the entire book above all!  You will enjoy this author's unique insight to the particular's about the region, as well as his attention to detail on the facts that really matter in telling a good story.  I have read many collections of stories about North Carolina, particularly because I have a personal facination with the region, especially the Outer Banks, but this this collection is one of the better ones.  This book also gives some intriguing history on the pirate Blackbeard.  If you are looking to read a few good tales about this region, then this book would be a good one for you to start with as all of the stories are quite entertaining. This author has written five collections of North Carolina stories in all, so if you find you like this one, there are more to explore.  Whedbee spins a great tale!	2000-10-31

This book is filled with intriguing mysteries and legends about the Tar Heel state.  The more famous story of Roanoke Island is covered here, as well as many others most from outside the region have probably never heard about.  The stories include tales about shipwrecks, anomalies of nature as well as disappearing people.  I found particularly interesting the story entitled 'The Devil's Tramping Ground' itself, as well as 'The Strange Hoof-Marks at Bath' and the mystery of 'The Brown Mountain Lights'.  These alone will capture anyone's imagination and spark a desire to explore the hills of North Carolina.  All in all a very enjoyable book, and if you like a good collection of short stories this is a good one for you.  The fact that they all come from a particular region and are researched North Carolina mystery stories makes it even more facinating and entertaining.	2000-10-15

Mr. Aaron had a magnificent career as one of the greatest baseball players of  all time, yet he was not as flamboyant and luminous as other figures in the  game that most fans are accustomed to remembering such as Willie Mays,  Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio or even  Babe Ruth.  Aaron was a methodical productive hitter that was a reliable  back bone of the Braves organization going back to it's Milwaukee days.  He  was the man who hit the game winning hit that propelled the Braves into the  1957 World Series, and I later years the only man to break Babe Ruth's home  run record making him still the all-time home run king in Baseball.  What  is sometimes over-shadowed by his home run title is the fact that he was  also a very all around hitter throughout his career.  Aaron had 2297 RBI's,  240 stolen bases, 98 triples, 624 doubles, 2174 runs, 3771 hits out of 3298  games he played and batted .305 in his career.  Incredible all around  numbers, and a man any coach would die for in their starting line-up.  This story tells much of the untold story of Aaron's career which he  candidly lays out in detail for the reader.  The high pressure racism he  experienced from his early days in the negro leagues, the South Atlantic  League and throughout his days as an Atlanta Brave.  The flood of death  threats and hate mail for his sole `crime' of being a black man approaching  Babe Ruth's record.  The book is beautifully presented and is  extraordinarily engrossing in it's dignified manner in which Aaron breaks  his long year's of silence portraying a tale of an illustrious career and a  thrilling American triumph.  Mr. Aaron is a legend, and this is more  than just any other sports biography.  I strongly recommend this book to  anyone, as it shines a light on our country's history that is seldom told.  I found this to be an astonishing tale about the baseball odyssey who hit  theglorious and impossble 715 in more ways than one.	2000-09-03

It is a text for any adult in life too.  If you consider it 'Sam I Am' was the ultimate salesperson fo  all time.  I have handed this book to new sales trainees wanting to know  'how to sell' as it gets across the simple example of 'persistence pays  off'.  It sheds light in the manner that salespeople are really the people  whose task it is to introduce new things into the society, and it is upon  their efforts and results that measure the new technology or products  ultimate success.  No new technology goes anywhere without someone along  the line selling it to someone.  I have long since felt that this simple  tale by Dr. Suess conveyed that lesson with this story about 'Sam I  Am'.<br />Additionally this book carries with it a message about really  looking and observing for yourself, and not just allowing your observations  about life to be confined into a snap answer to everything along the lines  of 'It's new or different, I don't like it and won't condsider it.'  Or  'It's not socially acceptable, I couldn't possibly...'  The resistent man  in this tale finally is made to really see things for himself, and  disregard his previous fixed opinions about things.  Ultimately he is  enlightened upon the glories of Sam's offering of Green Eggs and Ham, and  he finds upon actually trying them that he likes them.  This is a timeless  story that holds an incredible message about observation and on the flip  side, persistence.  <br />Look at it this way: had Sam not persisted with his  sales efforts, the man would have been denied the happiness he ultimately  found in trying Green Eggs and Ham.  Also if the man never looked and  finally tried it for himself, he would have missed out on some happiness he  did not know existed, because he was forbidding himself to actually look  and experience it himself and knocking aside all social considerations that  would retrain him.  <br />I consider this to be more than just a story spunby  Dr. Suess for entertainment of children, but more exactly a lesson about  life to be understood at all levels of society.  A elegant masterpiece if  wisdom.	2000-08-26

Tom Wolfe really does a wonderful job of making both an interesting factual presentation of history as well as a colorful  portrayal of the lives of those directly involved.  The stress on the wives  of the pilots for example gives one the untainted look at these incredible  ladies composure and character that is seldon captured in other historical  novels.  The astronauts and pilots themselves who were regarded as more  than human by the press of the period, are also portrayed very artfully in  this often candid expose' on their often carefree regard for the dangerous  jobs they constantly undertook.  These men and women truly had the  `Right  Stuff' at a very unpredictable period in US history: the dawn of the space  race.  High pressure situations continually kept all those involved on  constant edge.  This book carries you from the testing flight testing years  at Edwards airforce base where Yeager is the king, through the Sputnik  challenge and the American failed rocket testing early on, and finally  arriving at the eventual successful space flights themselves.  Throughout  the book is the ongoing weave of eager and relentless reporters, a  clamoring nation of people demanding immediate success, as well as the  political  pressure through three presidential administrations all piled on  the shoulders of those connected with the program.  The pressure cooker  builds as the story progresses, and the explosion of success takes everyone  involved by surprise including the astronauts themselves.  This is an  incredibly unique period in US history depicting the first astronauts who  were idolized in a time when the nation truly needed heroes for its own  personal pride.  These men restored patriotism at a time when the feeling  was considered lost.  Additionally Wolfe covers the early years of the  space programs development, including the Air Forces success with the X-15project which was over-shadowed by the popularity of the Mercury program.  The Mercury program's success sparked the later Apollo and Gemini programs  almost immediately after the first flight with Alan Shepard.  The sudden  success of the NASA space program created a silent upheaval in the national  brotherhood of pilots that is brilliantly detailed by the author giving a a  full picture to the reader.  One really gets the full practical viewpoint  and daredevil gallantry of the test pilots in this book that is seldom  touched elsewhere.  In addition to that the author describes the beginning  of the space program and the early positioning of power within that reveals  an almost complete upheaval at times by its early architects (scientists,  engineers, pilots, and all) and finally settling into a sensable orderly  structure in the later years. This book truly sheds light on the early  years of the NASA space program and gives one the candid look behind all  the fanfare showing what really was happening outside of the public eye.  Tom Wolfe completes a very tasteful coverage of the lives of the people  involved and the evolution of the exploration of the new frontier with this  exciting work. I found the later movie that followed the book to be very  much in keeping, however there are many details that are left out of the  movie that are covered in the book.  This alone makes it a must to read.  parts of the story that were unable to make it to the big screen was the  flight of Wally Shirra and Scott Carpenter.  These two flights alone had a  great deal to do with setting the future direction of the space program.  This is one you will enjoy as it will capture you interest from the  beginning and leave you with a sense of national pride at the bravery and  true pioneer spirit of all the people involved.  You will be amazed as I  was at the out-pouring of affection these men generated on America during  this period.  A stunning portrayal of a unique period in American history.  All in all a great book to read and enjoy.  I am very grateful to Tom Wolfe  for having written such a novel, as this was a story that needed to be  told.	2000-07-28

It takes place in a small Alabama town of Maycomb, with a three year journey through the life of a 8 year old girl named Scout Finch, her brother Jem and her father  Atticus.  Atticus Finch is a trial lawyer representing a young black man  accused of raping a white woman.  The entire story is told through the eyes  of a child who describes the event leading up to her brother's arm being  broken as the book begins it's course.  There is an incredible blend of  characters throughout this story including the mysterious town boogeyman  `Boo Radley'.    All of the stories events surround the trial their  father is involved in, and how he stands by his principles for a man he  knows to be innocent despite the ugly side of generalized racial predjudice  he is forced to endure as he takes on this case.  The children are soon  caught up in series of events they do not fully understand as a result of  this.    'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a brilliant literary work that  explores the conscienceness of innocence in a little southern girl with the  triumphant heart of an adventurer.  Harper Lee delivers a timeless novel  about truth and honesty that is gracefully forged with the undying  instruments of intrigue and heroism.    Although it is set in the  1930's in Alabama, it could very well translate itself to almost any modern  American city at any period in history with it's magnificent depth and  beauty.    Atticus is a true patriot of ethics and morality as he  stands firm on the principles of truth,  despite the vicious recoil he  endures in his journey.  A novel of profound impact on the heart and soul,  Harper Lee created an incredible and unforgettable novel that deserves to  be re-read generation to generation for its timeless example of fatherhood,  honesty and justice.  When I first read this book I knew that I had  read a work of something more than a mere tale about a lazy Southern town.   I was holding in my handstrue beauty written by a literary master.  You  will love this one without a doubt.  It will change you life, and rekindle  that radiant spark of endless childhood in your soul.  A great work indeed.	2000-07-24

Donaldson takes a bold step in `The Wounded Land' by allowing the existence of `the Land' to trickle out into the real world.  He then transports not only Thomas Covenant there, but also a new character `Linden  Avery' who offers a different perspective to the adventures they  subsequently encounter.  Thomas Covenant in this series seems more at ease  in the Land, and less resistive to the event transpiring around him.   Linden is confused by it, and endures her own personal turmoil throughout  the series.  This time the Land has declined to a low ebb, filled with  suffering and death.  The people have long forgotten their technology of  living with the land, and have been demoralized to an unthinkable level by  comparison with the first series.  Perhaps this is the authors subtle  expression and symbolic account of the decay in our own present society  reflected in this fantasy world? It certainly carries with it a great deal  of truth when you examine the comparison.  Nevertheless, Donaldson  continues his expertise with his incredibly creative characters and magical  beings.  He interweaves a great mix of plots and subplots and ties this  series in at various points to the previous one, making it a very  interesting and exciting story.  This is the second chronicles of Thomas  Covenant ( I recommend reading the first series before starting on this  one), and it sets the stage for great adventure in the following two books.   You will really become a Donaldson fan with this series, and find yourself  engrossed within its pages.  A great book and a very good story.	2000-07-05

My personal feeling is that not many books in literature today even come close to the adventure contained in the Hobbit.  'The Hobbit' has everything from the magic of wizards to the bravery of knights to the  simplicity of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit.  The culmination of this book at  the battle of five armies as a backdrop for the slaying of a giant dragon  named smog is untouched by any book I have ever read since.  This story  sets the table for J.R.R.Tolkien's opus trilogy 'The Lord of the Rings'  which is a masterpeice in itself.  When I first read the hobbit many years  ago it captured me for days and still a part of my heart today resides in  'Middle Earth'.  I think you will feel the same way when you read this  great story.  It's truly magical.  A really great one indeed.	2000-07-04

Additionally it shows a great representation of his blown glass work.  The elements that I found disappointing was the lack of  emphasis on his stained glass window work directly, although it does  provide some vivid photos of some of his lamps.  His window creations were  somewhat neglected here in this text, which was one of his passions if you  do further historical research into the man's history.  All in all,  however, this is a beautiful representation of Tiffany's expansive talents  that anyone would enjoy.

The only trouble that plagues him is that he has  no idea how to use it!  The 'Land' as the world is called in this trip is  building towards an enormous confrontation between good and evil.  Lord  Foul's evil servants have amassed an army that is overwhelming in size, and  the army of the good lord's seem out-matched.  The darkest times begin to  fall on Thomas Covenant and his companions, and only Covenant can save  them.  This book has some of the greatest characters in fiction, and  Donaldson's creativity is astounding.  You will certainly enjoy this whole  series if you are a lover of a good story that gets you captured in it.   For several days in a row I could do nothing but read these books (and  think about the next free time away from work that I would get a chance to  read them!)  They are a great collection, and the Illearth War is one of my  favorites as it is quite dramatic and emotional in comparison to the other  books.

The final volume of the Mission Earth Dekology `The Doomed Planet' is by far my favorite overall in this series.  Hubbard takes the reader to a new height with a crescendo of action and intrigue.  In this final novel we  find the villian Lombar Hisst, the madman behind the entire Earth mission,  ascending the throne of the Voltar empire after using drugs and other Earth  vices on the Emperor and Lords of the confederacy.  Meanwhile Heller  becomes a fugitive and joins the exiled Prince Mortiiy's rebel army to  engage in an invasion to overthrow Hisst out of Palace City.  Meanwhile J.  Walter Madison, the unleashed PR agent is trying to bring the house of  cards down on Earth and bring about a full scale invasion by the Conderacy!  This book is incredibly exciting as it brings to a glorious end all the  tales within tales of this this great 10 volume series.  Hubbard leaves no  stone unturned as he brings the series to it's ultimate conclusion with the  Apparatus (a Voltar type Covert operations organization) on the run facing  extiction.  The order starts to go into the society as the right criminals  are prosecuted and jailed.  The action throughout this book is in keeping  with the excitement of the whole series.  I found myself turning page after  page on this final volume, staying up long hours at night reading, reading,  reading, not wanting to miss a beat.  The whole series is exceptionally  wonderful as Hubbard makes simple, yet satirical observations on our own  society and calls attention to our own absurdities in the world we live.  He shows you Earth from different angles with humor and adventure all  wrapped up in a fast-paced suspense.  I found this wholes series to be  riveting, but this final book to be extraordinarily captivating as the  author brings all the roads of adventure he mapped in the ten part string  of novels to an ultimate climax.  I cannot say enough about this book and  the entire Dekalogy, except that it is a giant amongst giants in Science  Fiction.  You will love the entire series!  Volume 10 'The Doomed Planet'  is a great book, and rides high on my list of ultimate favorites!  I highly  recommend you take time for this ten step journey.  It's truly worth it.Science  Fiction.

The United States  is about to declare war.  The world's oil supply is declared radioactive  and owned by an alien!

If you read to this point in the series you  will be delighted with the outcome of this one, and the mystery of the next  two novels will compel you to read on!

It's very easy to get wound up in this story at this point when you reach volume 7 of Mission Earth.  The action in this book is equal or better than the preceding novels.  Hubbard has a unique way of upping the excitement in  each volume.  In this series a group of alien agents called the 'Aparatus'  seek to destroy Earth and plunder it for their own personal gain.  They  have arranged for a straight and honest Fleet Officer Jettero Heller from  the Voltairian Galactic government to be assigned to Earth and salvage it  from destroying itself through polution and neglect, and at the same time  fail and be destroyed in the attempt.  The Apparatus agent 'Soltan Gris' is  on Earth with Heller covertly striving to sabotage his mission creating  havoc at every turn.  He conspires to kill Heller and completely make his  mission a failure.  Introduced into this novel a group of rouge and  grotesque aliens arrive and plot air piracy to steal gold from agent Soltan  Gris using advanced technology.  Meanwhile Soltan Gris engages the  resources of a psychotic PR agent J. Walter Madison also known as J. Walter  Madman to destroy Heller in the press and ruin his reputation so he would  lose the support of his friends.  At the same time Soltan has a  nymphomaniac teenager shadowing his every move and the wild characters get  wilder as the story progresses.  Hubbard has a unique grasp fo creating  humor with the common place culture we live in, and at the same time  demonstrating to us the frailty of the society we exist in. This is quite a  sensational series, and it will leave you howling at times with the  satirical content.  I found this Dekalogy to be an inspiration of true  genius and sincerely wish Hubbard had written more.  I think you will enjoy  it too.	2000-06-25

In `Villiany Victorious' which is Volume 9 of Hubbard's Magnificent `Mission Earth' Dekology, the story returns to the planet Voltar after a dramatic departure from Earth.  Criminal Soltan Gris is neutralized, but  his psychotic boss `Lombar Hisst' is back on Voltar running out of control  attepting to seize the control of the Voltar confederacy.  He sends a Death  Battalian to Earth and they are turned to molten glass in an awesome  confrontation.  Lunatic PR agent J. Walter Madison is unleashed on Voltar  to corrupt the culture under the arm of the Apparatus, while Soltan Gris  awaits prosecution for his crimes on Earth and begins to write his  confessional which is the first 8 Volumes of this series.  Soltan Gris  becomes the target of Madison's slur campaign in a wild turn of events, and  the government of Voltar is in unheaval opening the door for the true  villian of the entire series, Lombar Hisst to take contol!    The only one  in his way is Jettero Heller, who knows both sides of the situation.  This  book is explosive in content, and is built entirely on the previous 8  volumes of this story.  The mastery of Hubbard really shines as all the  parts of this Dekology start to come together in a new light, and the  reader sees a unique dichotomy of two cultures: Earth and Voltar, and the  plus and minus points of each.  I truly found this book to be facinating  and filled with exciting adventure as the other volumes, but the tale  climbs to a whole new level that can only be arrived at by having read the  preceding ones.  You finally see what Hubbard was doing here with this  Dekology, and why it took ten volumes to truly convey and express the story  to the reader.  This whole series is brilliant , and among the best I have  ever read!  It combines a satirical look at our own culture, as well as  another unique satircal look at a supposed `utopian' culture, and you see  the flaws of each in this comparison.  `Villian Victorious' is a true blend  of great Science Fiction and humor.  You will truly enjoy this one, I am  sure.  It is worth the journey.	2000-06-25

Fortune of Fear is the fifth book in Hubbard's great Dekology Mission Earth.  It ushers back in the character Countess Krak who arrives on Earth.  She makes her way from Turkey to Atlantic City and joins her lover the  hero of the story Jettero Heller, whom by now is well into his plan to  salvage Earth.  Their mortal enemy, Soltan Gris, is actively attempting to  sabotage Heller's mission.  This book blazes a trail from the Mediterranean  to the Swiss banks and back into a mafia-contolled casino, where the action  is intense.  You will love how Soltan get himself into such bizarre  situations, and digs himself further everytime!  A wonderful story, and a  charming look at our world from a very talented author.	2000-06-23

I found this book 'The Invader's Plan' opening the series to be very exciting and  interesting, mixed with intrique and adventure.  This book launches the  series with a plot by essentially a CIA type group called the 'Apparatus'  on another planet who launch a complicated scheme to invade an off-limits  planet called Earth.  Earth has been labeled off-limits to galactic  conquest because it has to develop more before it will come up on the  Voltar galactic confederacy's timetable for invasion.  These individuals  create a covert plan to invade earlier than scheduled to take advantage of  the resources of Earth so they can personally profit before anyone else.   They unwittingly choose to involve an honest and resourceful officer in the  military fleet to set up as the fall guy for the entire scheme, but soon  find they are not really in as much control as they imagine as they set  forth to invade earth.  The young fleet officer is Jettero Heller whose  intention is to accomplish his mission, which is to salvage earth.  His  unknown adversary is Soltan Gris whose intention and covert orders is to  see to it that Heller's mission is sabotaged in favor of his group who seek  to profit from Earth and plunder it themselves.  And the game is afoot!   Hubbard blends a wonderful selection of satire, adventure and science  fiction in this magnificent dekalogy.  I highly suggest you read the entire  series, as it will make you laugh at the author's witty and humorous  observations of the times we live.  Hubbard truly is one of the great  Golden Age of Science fiction writers and he exlemplifies that with this  great work.  I enjoyed it tremondously.  You will too.	2000-06-22

The main character, Thomas Covenant, is a man who has contracted leprosy and lives reluctantly as an `unclean' hermit, outcast and pariah amid a  society that has rejected him.  In his protest of his neighbors paying his  bills for him (in their attempt to keep him from ever having to leave the  house) he ventures forth to pay his phone bill in person, only to find the  bill is already paid.  On his return walk to his home he is hit by a  speeding police car and awakes in a different world called `The Land'.    His first encounter is with the Despiser, Lord Foul whom the people of the  land call the `Gray Slayer'.  Lord Foul desires to escape from `The Land'  and eradicate all hope from the Earth, but can only do so if he possesses  white gold, which carries with it unusual and invincible power in the land,  the very substance of Thomas Covenants wedding ring.  Only Lord Foul cannot  take it, it must be relinquished by Covenant for him to make use of the  power.  The white gold is the most powerful substance in the land, but the  trouble is that Covenant has no idea how to use it! Covenant becomes the  reluctant hero in a story he does not want to be a part of, or believe.  He  is thus called the `Unbeliever' and the story unfolds.  There is an  incredible mixture of characters in the book by Donaldson that will capture  your heart and soul.  From the `Blood Guard' warriors, who are  self-appointed body guards to the most important people in the land, to the  mighty giants longing to return home, this book has some of the most  imaginative characters in fiction.  Donaldson has accomplished the greatest  challenge faced by any writer in this work by creating an entirely new  fantasy world that will dismay your imagination.  My first impression was  that I disliked Thomas Covenant, but as I read on through all three books  in this series, and the three in the second series, my viewpoint changed.   Covenant grows with this story, as does the reader and you will find  yourself emotionally captured in the struggle for freedom with the  characters within these pages.  This book is a brilliantly creative work  that you will thoroughly enjoy, and is the first book in the entire series  of six.	2000-06-18

The head of the  circus 'Mr. Dark' will really give you chills as he is a pure through and  through villian seeking the souls of everyone in town.

The collection of stories is more of an account of various observations and reflections about Mars and man.  The  stories all tie together in one sense as they are about Mars, but each  paints an entirely different viewpoint about the planet from the  perspective of the people who go there or reside there.  All the stories  are good, and unique unto themselves.  I found this book to be quite  remarkable.	2000-06-16

The main charcter 'Marlow' is employed by an ivory company to  take command of a cargo boat stranded in the interior, and from there the  adventure springs from around every treacherous bend of the river.

This book by Tony Martin  allowed me to learn more about them.  Mr. Martin has been studying the  Beluga whales for over 17 years, and gives the reader a wonderful  descriptive summary complete with the whales pattern of life, evolution and  unique characteristics.

Above all classic  scenes in Science Fiction history, these few minutes are a George Lucas  masterpeice.  Now consider this, what about all those other characters in  the bar that evening?  How did they wind up there, and what happened to  them before they arrived there or after they left that evening?  A  facinating concept to say the least!  That is what this collection of  stories is about.  It is compiled by several talented authors with  wonderful imaginations and all edited by Kevin J. Anderson to create a most  enjoyable and adventurous read.  It does fantastic credit to the movie, and  at the same time expands your viewpoint of how you look at it.  After  reading this collection, I was compelled to que up my VCR and review the  famous Star Wars bar scene over and over again!  I found this book  incredibly entertaining and it is still one of my favorites.  It's very  simple, but good quality entertainment.  You will enjoy reading this one  again and again.	2000-06-13

The entire tone is about death and dying and the unhappy people surrounding it.  The character Darl is interesting, and Faulker's unique conveying of the story from different viewpoints as  the book unfolds is what I feel is what makes for the sensational reviews.  Although I understand many find this a work of literary genius, I don't  feel it merits that much enthusiasm.  This is essentially a unhappy story  about sad people transporting a dead woman's body across a broken society.  It does have it's creative points, but a reader looking for a good story to  invest their time in reading would find better stories elsewhere.	2000-06-10

The concepts Herbert indulges in here will keep you pondering for weeks, months and years after you read it.  Essentially an  experiment is conducted on a  planet enclosed behind a created protective barrier called the 'God Wall'  to keep the inhabitants from leaving.  A series of hostile conditions are  created complete with toxic waste, hunger and war.  The inhabitants are all  unknowing 'test subjects' in a grand experiment, and develop into the most  dangerous people in the universe, frightening their creators with their  abilities.  As events unfold, the inhabitants of Dosadi actually learn how  to pass through the 'God Wall' unleashing themselves on the universe and  the culmination of the tale winds up in the most unusual trial you will  ever read.  All in all quite a facinating exploration into a broad new  territory for Herbert, marking him as one of the great pioneers of the  genre of Science Fiction.  This book is currently out of print and the copy  I have is very old, but it is well worth searching used books stores to  read this one.  It is actually Herbert's sequel to 'Whipping Star'.	2000-06-07

The business conduct and  customs are suprisingly correct, from the minor details of exchanging of  business cards to the hidden social standards of honor and dishonor that  interweave the typical Japanese corporate echelon of power.

The story unfolds across land, sea and air in an ultimate  global fury as both sides seek ultimate global control.  The concept is  chilling and suspenseful with every page.  By far this is one of Clancy's  most brilliant works.  It has lot's of action and hard-hitting truth about  modern military confrontation that is frighteningly real.  This book pulls  no punches, and paints no romantic picture of the advances of warfare on  this planet.  It leaves one with the awareness that the outcome of such a  clash is not always a foregone conclusion as to who will be the victor, or  whether such advances in technology can ever give any nation a sense of  absolute security or defense.  Despite all the technology, Clancy lays out  for the reader the human element is the ultimate determining factor in this  ambitious portrait of warfare.   This is a story that is not easy to  forget, which to me makes it a gem.  I found it to be a frightening,   macabre vision of the potential of a world breaking down international  communication leading to a hot-tempered hostile global engagement and  proceeding down the terrifying path of possible apocalyptic finality for us  all.  Clancy takes the reader to the edge in this book, where it almost  goes out of control and you get a sense of having been suddenly rescued by  a miracle of fortune from falling over a cliff into the inevitable. I  enjoyed this book tremendously.	2000-05-22

When their only source of  external revenue is threatened by company in the US, and their demands  ignored, they go to war with the United States and win before the US  realizes thay are at war!  the Cold war humor is quite enjoyable, and the  message this book presents is one of &quot;You can conquer anything if you  have enough of the right intention&quot;.  The ultimate 'underdog' and  'little guy becomes the hero' story if there ever was one. I cannot say  enough about how wonderful this book is.  It will make you roll you eyes at  times, and cause you to squirm with embarrassment for the characters and  also laugh aloud.  In the end you will find yourself cheering.  It is  probably one of the most important books in political satire ever written,  and should be required reading for all who seek positions of power in our  modern society.

It changed the way I looked at the world.  Simple in content, and perhaps a story out-moded for the present adventures found in SF, it still  has a particular value to the reader that will make it a favorite.  This  book was about unbridled ambition.  A handful of young rocket enthusiasts  and a instructor build a rocket ship and go to the moon utilizing their own  wits and resources.  Heinlein taps into the possibilities that could shape  the future, and essentially poses the question 'How long will space  exploration remain only a government exercise? Why couldn't private  citizens take it upon themselves to explore the stars themselves?'

The stories that Kinsella pens in this wonderful collection will change the way you look at the world.  Baseball is is more than just a pastime, it is an American legacy.   This book brings the romance and passion of the devoted heart of a culture  to a vibrant vitality of existence, and will capture the reader in it's  embrace. The traditionalists will love the story about astro-turf, and the  tenacious Cub fan will love the prophetic story about armageddon. I dearly  loved this collection.	2000-04-24

Why wasn't that included in the book?', but nonetheless this book is a treasure.  I dearly loved every page I turned  and every paragraph I read.  It is loaded with photos of a great many heros  of the game, and enlightening backgound and stories.  It obviously was a  great effort to put this book together, and I consider it a worthy tribute  to the subject.  Baseball is a sport of emotion and devotion.  It has grown  with America, and therefore is an integral part of our nation's soul.  More  can always be told about history of the game, and more should be told, but  this is a wonderful presentation.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2000-04-23

It had a very simple story, but was filled with adventure and creativity to keep my interest.  I found it much simpler to to read than some of Niven's later works, but quite a  pleasurable read.  I would suggest this book highly as an introduction to  the writings of Larry Niven to anyone choosing to read his stories for the  first time.	2000-04-23

I thoroughly enjoyed the charm and wit of Cervantes tale of misadventure of the great knight.  Don Quixote's imaginary spirit and pure devotion to  chivalry is a noble quality often lost in this modern day and age.  I  dearly loved this book, and often found myself laughing aloud at humor  written ages past.  The world needs more Don Quixote's indeed.	2000-04-23

It captured my interest and wonder.  I think of all the times man has looked to the sky at night and marveled at it's vast expanse and depth, and  this novel opens the door of possibility.  The tale these two authors spin  together in this one is one of pure genius and imagination.  It can be  pretty tricky to follow at times, but if you are determined, you will mark  this book as one of your favorites upon completion.  When I think of modern  Science Fiction I think of this novel as a true gem. The milestone of a  good book is whether it is entertaining and interesting, and the Mote is  all that and more.  Simply wonderful.  If you like good books you will  truly enjoy this one.	2000-04-23

I gave me a quick broad understanding of the internet and the world of marketing online.  I have since gone on to expand my knowledge by  my own adventures online, but this book I read early on and it truly helped  me get started.  I managed to take a great deal of the data I learned in  this book and apply it to my own business's new ventures online, and  developed my own unique niche and identity for my website though some of  the tidbits I found in this book.

His wit and brilliance teaches one the most fundamental  techniques at the same time as allowing the salesman to maintain his  integrity and honesty and truly satisfy the customer.

I found it to be a little rougher on the mystery that was so created with the first one, but still enjoyable in it's own unique way.  I think  any fan of Niven and Pournelle would enjoy this sequel.  It had more of a  political emphasis than the first and I understand the need to include this  factor in the saga, but I felt somewhat disappointed with the ending,  wanting more as a reader. There are many action packed moments, however,  and it does lend a new light on the aliens encountered than the first book.   The imagination of these two brilliant authors is commendable.  The two  books together are very entertaining, but both entirely different in tone.	2000-04-23

Levinson really sifts out a lot of nonsense of  marketing tactics, and gives you one atomic weapon after another to really  launch an effective attack on the marketplace and hold a position.  It was  a book of continuous eureka's for me as I read.  I suggest keeping a  notepad handy as you read because your bright ideas will begin to explode  one after the other and you will want to record them for later use.  This  book is entirely loaded with data.  I recommend it for everyone with a  desire to be successful in business.	2000-04-23

The Pak Protectors are quite a race.  They are both complicated in origin, but simple in purpose.  This book was  very interesting, as it describes the evolution of the protectors more than  the Ringworld novels do.  Larry Niven is a genius at the technical side of  Science Fiction, and this novel was facinating and filled with action.  I  enjoyed it from many angles.	2000-04-23

I captures a great deal of the unbridled spirit of discovery of the unknown that lies deep in the heart of all adventurers.  My only disappointment with this  novel was that it seemed at many times to take the reader almost 80% there  in the excitement, but would fail to cross that line that would make it a  gripping page turner.  I loved the entire concept of the world, and any  science fiction fan will enjoy the creativity in this area.  This book  could have been an explosive breakthrough in the SF, but was a little short  on the plot.  It seemed that Foster had this great idea for this world, but  when he got all the characters there and the world evolved, he ran out of  ideas of what was going to happen to really make this an epic. I did enjoy  this book tremendously, however, as it does give you a journey to a far  away place.	2000-04-22

It is a story everyone should read, as it is a supreme credit to the wonder of Science  Fiction from an author that is a master at gripping the reader and keeping  you in the story.  Hubbard kept me up late nights reading this book, and  kept me coming back for more, page after page.   His command of the  literary prose could lose those not accustomed to such a wide vocabulary,  which would explain the reviews of those who are critical of the book.  It  seems some have been so confused that they confuse completely different   subjects with the book such as Hubbard's non-fiction works.  This same  mentality would align with those that would criticize Michelangelo's work  in sculpture while examining one of his paintings.  It makes no sense, and  actually comes across as a sort of psychosis. Battlefield Earth is merely a  wonderful Science Fiction adventure. Any reader who actually reads this  story from beginning to end will enjoy it like none other.  Every genre has  it's classics, and Battlefield Earth is one that deserves this title  alongside such masterpieces as Dune by Herbert, Ringworld by Niven and the  many other fantastic authors of Science Fiction like Asimov, Pohl,  Pournelle, Heinlein, and more. I really enjoyed this book, and have gone on  to read other Science Fiction works by L. Ron Hubbard and have enjoyed them  thoroughly.  I respect him as a very fine author, and I consider him to be  a very talented man in this field. It is worth your time to read this one.  You will enjoy it I am certain.	2000-04-21

Ron Hubbard wrote a complete masterpiece with this book.  I could not put it down.  I kept me wrapped up in it for days.  I could hardly find time for anything else when I read this incredible tale.  I had so many  plot twists and turns, and Hubbard has an incredible vocabulary, I can see  how the novice reader might get lost.  Hubbard really has a command of the  roaring adventure tale like few in literature in modern times.  I  thoroughly enjoyed this one, and it made me a Hubbard fan! I think if you  actually read the book you will enjoy it.  It seems by some of the reviews  that many people attacking Hubbard never really read the book, but have  some sort of psychotic vendetta against the man personally.  This man wrote  an incredible book of Science fiction adventure far superior to many  contemporaries of his day.  Perhaps these people are jealous of his skill?   It would not be the first profession I have seen attacked for being great.  Anyway, I enjoyed the book.  It was one hell of a ride.  You should read it  to.  Thank you Mr. Hubbard for the wonderful story.	2000-02-25

There was always excitement around  every corner and the story grew and grew, exceeding my expectations with  every chapter.  Hubbard demonstrated his brilliance with the many turns of  the plot, but at the same time keeps teh story moving at a rapid rate in an  ever expanding direction that combines all the greatests moves in action,  adventure and Science Fiction.  What a joy to read!  I sincerely recommend  this book.

I often found myself laughing out loud  during some of the hilarious situations Smith and Pedrito found themselves  in!  I thoroughly enjoyed this adventure tale with its original plot that  actually was sparked by an actual experience in Hubbard's life during his  worldly travels!  It leaves a reader with the compelling thought 'What if a  case of mistaken identity really happened to me?' and 'Do I have a double  on this planet?'  The intrigue of this plot is what keeps you reading and  afterward tags this book in your memory as a great 'What If' novel.  I  loved the combination of these two authors, and so will you .
