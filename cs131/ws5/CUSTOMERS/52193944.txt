I recently came across my copy of this book that I purchased with my  allowance money many many years ago when I was in elementary school. I  remember giving this book as a birthday present to all of my friends that  year! If the book was still available, I can think of numerous people upon  whom I would bestow a copy.<br />This book is wonderful, especially if you  dislike cats. Mr. Bond's drawings dramatically illustrate his ideas for  what to do with the carcass of the cat.<br />Keep in mind that Mr. Bond isn't  telling you how to get a dead cat, only what to do with one once it is  dead.	2000-08-15

As stated above, I don't have a spiffy title for my review. However, if you'd like to hear raves about your dessert at a formal dinner party, mix up a batch of the Cataloupe Sorbet with Minted Melon from this cookbook.  It's practically a staple in our home when we bring out the formal  china!<br />We did make a few changes to the recipe to make our lives easier.  We buy a few slices of honeydew and watermelon off the local grocery store  salad bar instead of entire melons that would go to waste. We don't use  specially carved cantaloupe rinds to serve the sorbet. We also used dried  mint instead of fresh for a stronger taste.	2000-07-08

I'm going to go out on a limb here and be a heretic by disagreeing with the other reviewers of this book. I thought it was an utter piece of trash. The book was entirely predictable. I knew from the third chapter that the  Catholic Timothy would become a priest and he'd fall in love with the  Jewish Deborah who would be tossed out of the family home by her  one-dimensional father. In fact, I found all of the characters to be  disagreeable, the plot tedious and the manipulation of religion to suit the  storyline distasteful.<br />I suppose if you are looking for a good laugh,  this book might be interesting. I, however, didn't even find it funny. I  found myself exclaiming out loud &quot;Oh come on! That's ridiculous!&quot;  at multiple times as the book progressed. If you value your time, don't  waste it on this book.	2000-07-08

Before my last trip to the Keys, I picked up two books: this one and the Insider's Guide to the Keys. The Insider's Guide was less opinionated and had more &quot;tourist&quot; information but it was harder to find what you  were looking for.<br />This book is organized is such a manner that it's very  simple to find out the history of each Key as you drive down the Overseas  Highway from Florida City to Key West. You'll read about the attractions,  the places to stay and the restaurants Key by Key. That's very helpful.  There's no flipping from chapter to chapter just to find out about the  attractions in one place, dining in another, water activities in yet  another place and accomodations elsewhere.<br />I also liked the opinions that  the author expressed. For example, her takes on the Conch Tour Train, the  Little White House, Mallory Square and the Key West Aquarium were right in  line with our experiences. We happily skipped some other attractions based  on this book and we don't believe we missed out on a thing. <br />If anything,  there are some interesting things we saw in the Keys that weren't touched  upon in this guidebook. How could the author leave out Robbie's Marina  where for $1 you can &quot;SEE the Tarpon&quot; and for an additional $2  you can &quot;FEED the Tarpon&quot;? This &quot;attraction&quot; was  mentioned to me at least a dozen times by various people I talked to,  including a stranger at the post office in Virginia!<br />I really enjoyed  this guidebook and only wish that  it was even more comprehensive.	2000-06-07

I finally purchased a copy of Frommer's Arizona guide after my 5th trip to the state since I'm certain we'll be returning many times.<br />If you're in a major city such as Phoenix or Tucson or if your're going to a smaller  location such as Sedona or a more tourist oriented place like the Grand  Canyon or Canyon de Chelly, this is a nice book. It's a bit to thick to  actually tote around with you while you're touring but it's nice to have to  look at your various options. <br />Where this book could be improved is to  add a &quot;driving tour&quot; in addition to the walking tours. For  example, there's a drive down I-10 from Phoenix to Tucson that just about  everyone uses to get between the two cities. Casa Grande and Florence are  mentioned as is Picacho Peak, but they are hidden away as a &quot;side  trip&quot; from Phoenix. In that context, Tucson isn't really mentioned as  a destination. I'd like to see more emphasis placed on what there is to see  between your destinations. Another example is the drive from Phoeniz to  Yuma. Supposedly there are petroglyphs to see outside of Gila Bend but this  guidebook doesn't mention them. I found that information in a National  Geographic guide to the major highways.<br />I also found the organization of  this book to be confusing the first time I used it. You start out in  Phoenix then work your way north to Sedona, to the northwest for the Grand  Canyon, to the northeast for the four corners area and then directly south  for the Painted Desert. Next you jump south of Phoenix to Tucson, southwest  to Organ Pipe National Monument and southeast to Tombstone and Bisbee. Next  it's a giant leap west to Lake Mead, Lake Havasu City and Yuma. If I was  unfamiliar with the state, I'd be completely lost!<br />I realize that a  guidebook can't be everything to everyone, but in a large state such as  Arizona, you spend a lot more time in the car to see attractions compared  to eastern states. It's a matter of scale. I'd like to see a little more  attention paid to that reality.<br />Overall, this is not a bad guidebook and  one of the best available.	2000-05-20

Most of them cover individual skaters or they lightly gloss over the &quot;pretty&quot; aspects of the sport with colorful photographs of skaters posing. You'll  find behind-the-scenes books telling you the inside scoop about what  happens on tour or the life of a competitive skater.  What there aren't  many books about are those that cover the actual mechanics of skating past  learning how to tie your skates and do a waltz jump.<br />The late Carlo Fassi  was one of the premier skating coaches that the sport has ever known. He  worked with top skaters and brought out their best. The author of this book  has impeccable credentials.<br />If you're interested in photographs of  skaters performing each move, seek out a copy of John Misha Petkevitch's  &quot;Figure Skating.&quot; You'll just find hand drawn illustrations here.  I find that these drawings capture movement better than photographs and  skating is all about movement.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned the  chapters about triple jumps and various spins. What I'm finding very  helpful is the chapter about compulsory figures. Just ten years ago,  figures were dropped from international competition. Since then, they've  been dropped from the U.S. competition structure and it's extremely  difficult to find patch time or instruction. The sport is losing part of  its heritage and the coaches I've spoken to bemoan the loss of edge quality  in up and coming skaters who haven't done figures. I'm finding this one  chapter to be most instructive.	2000-05-20

I wish I had been exposed to this as a freshman. I might have switched out of a civil  engineering major a year earlier! Instead, I read this in graduate school  when the students I was working with were given this book for required  reading. The majority of the students in my sections seemed to enjoy  reading this book. <br />Richard Fenno, the author, is a well-respected  congressional scholar. This book is a little more accessible to the average  reader than &quot;Congressmen in Committees&quot; and &quot;Home  Rule.&quot; The book isn't entertainment reading but it's easy to get  through.<br />After reading this, I found I had a much better understanding of  how the Senate really works and I also gained a lot of respect for Dan  Quayle. He may not be the world's best public speaker, especially when it  comes to off the cuff remarks, but I found myself admiring his work in the  Senate.	2000-05-04

I agree with another reviewer here about how the storyline andcharacters for this novel are just utterly preposterous! If theprotagonist of the novel really was an ultra-Orthodox Jew, nothingthat was expected of her after marriage would have been a surprise. <br />The husband is originally portrayed as a sympathetic character but almost immediately becomes a caricature. He starts beating his wife and torturing her. Her parents don't give a hoot when she calls them to tell them that her husband is abusing her. Supposedly their lives revolved around her before she married. All of a sudden, they stopped caring. Real people just aren't like that. <br />While the writing style was engaging, I finished this book merely for the entertainment value. The plot twists were so outrageous that they were quite amusing.	2000-05-02

Not just knowing how to play each major scale but understanding the various permutations of all of the major and minor and chromatic scales. You need to have these drilled into your brain and your fingers backwards and  forwards inside out and upside down until you don't have to think at all  about them. They just will flow effortlessly out of your horn.<br />To learn  how to do this, I highly recommend this collection of exercises. I started  using it when I was in the 8th grade and I continued to practice out of it  daily until I finished my collegiate playing days. When I decide to return  to the clarinet (I am on an extended hiatus), this will be the method book  I use to get back into the instrument.	2000-04-30

I felt as if I was on the U.S.S. Mako with the rest of the crew experiencing the battles and everyday strife along with them.<br />When I visted the U.S.S. Bowfin museum and the submariner's  memorial in Pearl Harbor, I immediately returned to this book and the  others in the series in my mind. People tend to remember the sailors on the  carriers and the battleships but forget the tense and dangerous work done  beneath the ocean's surface.	2000-04-30

Since it is part of the Pyramid Illustrated History of the Movies series, that is to be expected.<br />You'll find plenty of black and white photographs and reviews  of Kelly's films. The book was published in 1976 so it understandably ends  well before Mr. Kelly's death. For a more in-depth look, I'd suggest either  Clive Hirshhorn's biography &quot;Gene Kelly&quot; or Tony Thomas's  &quot;The Films of Gene Kelly.&quot; Considering that there are only a few  books about Mr. Kelly that have been published, this is well worth picking  up if you're a fan.	2000-04-30

I was very lucky to have Daniel Boorstin's &quot;The Discoverers&quot; assigned as a textbook for an undergraduate class I took back in the spring of 1988 on European Expansion and Colonization from 1450-1750. Ordinarily, history textbooks are a bit dry. I enjoyed reading them enough to end up  only one class short of a double major in History, but this one stood out  head and shoulders above the rest.<br />For a change, the text completely held  my attention. Instead of only reading the assigned portions, I read the  entire book. Upon discussing this with my classmates, I learned that each  of them had done the same. <br />Perhaps my memory is tainted because this was  an overall fun class where we studied actual sailable scale models of  caravels built using the actual techniques of the time. But, I recently  finished re-reading the book and it was just as much fun the eighth or  ninth time around. I've read it so many times that I've lost count.<br />The  two sections that I've always found riveting are the discovery of longitude  and Captain Cook muddling around Antarctica. This book is just wonderful. I  only wish that the sequel, &quot;The Creators&quot;, was just as good. I  found that one to be a bit rambling.	2000-04-27

I've been a huge fan of Jim Dale's from the very early 80's when I first heard him on the soundtrack to &quot;Barnum.&quot; For the audio version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, Mr. Dale has outdone  himself and I can think of no better person to read the book aloud. I had  purchased the hardback about six months ago but I was introduced to the  audio version this past weekend. I was in tears hearing the line &quot;Send  me an owl.&quot; There is such a sense of humor in this cassette set. I  imagine I'll be purchasing these as an addition to the hardcovers I already  own.	2000-04-27

I love dogs and I also had the wonderful experience of attending a Presidential send-off at the White House during the Bush Presidency. I was standing behind a cordoned off area when Ranger (one of Millie's puppies  who had grown up a bit) ran over to us. What a sweet dog! Later that  afternoon, I was walking through Union Station and saw &quot;Millie's  Book&quot; for sale. I thought it was a children's book and was going to  pass on it but decided to buy it since proceeds would benefit Mrs. Bush's  literacy program and I had just met one of Millie's pups.<br />This isn't a  children's book. It's an engagingly written account of life at the White  House from a dog's-eye point of view. <br />I was greatly amused by the  photographs of President Bush letting Millie in and out and in and out! The  apology letter and photograph to the gardeners for digging in the tulips  was just precious. The narrative made the Bush family seem just like  everyday folks who are just like the rest of us. When the dog misbehaved,  she became &quot;YOUR dog&quot; instead of &quot;Our dog.&quot; That's  exactly the  same in my own house!<br />This is a non-partisan book which  gives you a behind the scenes look at the White House and at Presidential  life. I enjoyed this light read very much.	2000-04-27

I was very apprehensive before I skiied for the first time because I was going to be skiing with some excellent athletes (including a former Olympian!). The only book on skiing that was in stock at my local bookstore  was &quot;Learn Downhill Skiing in a Weekend&quot; so I purchased it.  <br />The best way to learn how to ski is to take lessons and to actually go  out and ski. However, this book was the next best thing. I learned all  about how to dress, how to use the equipment, some exercises, slope  ettiquette and I read up on what I should be doing once I started down the  mountain. The book was a great introduction but should not be used in place  of lessons. Please, do yourself a favor and take lessons. The book really  isn't a substitute but it is an excellent SUPPLEMENT. My day on the slopes  turned out well although I didn't brave the black diamond trails with my  friends. I stuck to the bunny slope and an intermediate hill. <br />This book  is aimed at the rank beginner with little to no knowledge of the sport.	2000-04-27

I can't even think of the title of this book without a grin plastered to my face. When I was very tiny and first learning to read aloud, I used to read this  book to my younger brother. He found it riveting and it quickly became his  favorite book and a nightly ritual to &quot;read&quot; the book.  Ordinarily, no reading took place because the book was so simple to  memorize. I can still recite the entire volume, cover to cover, almost  thirty years later!<br />My brother now has two sons and the first present I  bought for them was a spanking new copy of &quot;Bears in the Night.&quot;  The elder of the two has it commited to memory. Since the younger boy is  only six months old, I'll give him a few more months until he has done the  same!<br />Seriously, this book has a simple but attention grabbing plot where  the kids are mischevious and sneak out of bed after dark. They go exploring  and soon find that scary things lurk in the dark on the top of Spook Hill.  Thankfully, they make their way home to safety. Somehow, you know that Mom  was completely aware of what they were up to but knowingly let the children  learn this lesson for themselves.	2000-04-26

Not only did I empathize with Harry because as I child I hated baths as much as  Harry does, but I also knew that even when I was at my filthiest, way down  deep inside, I was still loved.<br />I have a very dirty dog at home who is in  desperate need of a &quot;fur cut&quot;.

Things that I struggled with  (such as performance anxiety before auditioning) became trivial. The  history of the instrument is laid out in an interesting manner and it is  chock full of tips on how to care for your horn and become a better player.

Everyone knows that there is a balance of power between the judiciary, the legislative and the executive branches. Neustadt claims that the President is the weak leg of the stool and that he is unable to govern alone. He must  use his powers of persuasion in order to convince the other branches of the  government to do his bidding.<br />As part of a graduate program in political  science with a concentration on the United States, you will read this book.  If you don't, I am happy to go out on a limb and say that there is  something wrong with your program! <br />This is one of the three seminal  works available on the Presidency. There are others but this is one of the  big guns. If you read this book, along with Corwin's &quot;Presidential  Power&quot; and Rossiter's &quot;The American Presidency&quot;, you'll  understand all three theories of presidential power: the weak President  (Neustadt), the strong President (Corwin) and the President wearing many  hats (Rossiter). In reality, all three are correct.<br />It's interesting but  a scholarly read. It's not a book you'd pick up for light after dinner  reading.	2000-04-25

The first time I visited the Saguaro National Park in Tucson, Arizona, I had dozens of questions about saguaros. I wanted to know why their arms grow down toward the ground sometimes and why some of them have a brown  woody bark and why some of them have ripples and what happens to you if you  get caught shooting at a saguaro. This book answered all of my questions  and then some!<br />I found out that the arms sometimes start to grow  downwards if there is a cold spell right as the arms start to grow. Only  very old saguaros get the woody bark and they become more like a regular  tree as they age. The ripples are caused by droughts and rainy years during  growth cycles and you'll be fined very heavily if you shoot at a saguaro  because they are protected under state law.<br />It's a thin, paperback book  and it's written in a manner that it would be interesting to children as  well as to adults but it's definitely aimed at an older reader. Tons of  beautiful desert scenes!	2000-04-13

My past few trips to  Florida have been to Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and Vero Beach  as well as Miami and the Keys. It's nice to have the basic information in  one place.<br />However, I always feel that Fodor's guidebooks tend to be a  little superficial.

I also don't care for the type of paper stock that Fodors uses.  I like to take a highlighter to my guidebooks and you can't use them on  this paper because it bleeds through the pages.

This manual has been in print in various formats since 1966. My copy is the 1981 reprint. Since then, there have been numerous changes to the USFSA test schedule which means that the book doesn't have the newer dances such  as the Hickory Hoedown and Cha Cha. You'll notice that there wasn't a  Pre-Bronze test then and these days we thankfully don't have to test the  Three Lobe Waltz to pass Pre-Gold!<br />However, the information in this book  is timeless. If you're a dancer and you've ever wanted to know exactly what  the judges expect of you at each level, this is the book for you. Common  mistakes are listed for each dance as well as whether these mistakes are  minor which will allow the dance to still be passable when testing, or  major which will result in a failing mark.<br />In addition, there are  sections on dance terminology, general judging principles, and musical  rhythms. There are numerous diagrams that are easily understandable and  some good photographs.<br />If you can find a copy of this book anywhere, snap  it up. You won't regret it!	2000-04-08

I looooovve room service too! Oh, and charge it please. Thank you very  much.	2000-04-07

This is an outstanding guide book full of beautiful pictures and right on information. I picked up this book before my second trip to Kauai. We had visited the island the year before for our honeymoon. I really wish we had bought this book a year earlier!<br />There were so many things on Kauai that  we didn't even think of to do or see the first time and we bumbled around  from place to place, seeing little of the island. The second trip, we used  this guidebook and checked out some outstanding restaurants and beaches.  Without the book, we never would have gone to JoJo's Clubhouse for shave  ice or found parking for Ke'e Beach.<br />Something we found helpful was  the aerial photos of the resorts section where we got to see just how far  the ocean is from where you are planning to stay. We were at the Hyatt for  both trips and would readily make reservations there again in a  heartbeat!<br />This is an amazing resource for the island. I wish the authors  would write books for Maui and Oahu!	2000-04-06
