Amsterdam is a quick read and you won't be angry that you wasted your time; however, you might be angry it won the Booker Prize.  Briefly, McEwan tells his (rather uncomplicated and rather unamazing) story very well, very precisely, never wasting a word.  However, at the end, the reader can only ask a quick question: Who cares?  Ian McEwan is a superb craftsman, there's no doubt about it...but the problem is, with Amsterdam, it's ALL craft and nothing more.  You'll feel, once your done, that you've been staring at a piece of furniture for hours, because this book is, ultimately, incredibly forgettable and unimportant.  Surely, there must have been a better book the year this won the Booker???	2005-03-27
US	52525720	RECSEE0CSEAQA	1573222631	795188046	Aloft	Books	2	7	14	N	N	Why did anybody like this book?	I, too, read \\"Aloft\\" based on reviews and articles in the New York Times. And now, I admit, I feel, for lack of a better word, victimized. This is a novel that's already been written many times over...and also much, much better.  <br /> <br />First, I've known many Italian-Americans from Long Island, and not one of them talks or speaks or, I daresay, thinks like the narrator of \\"Aloft.\\" (And that, by the way, is saying something POSITIVE about Ital-Americans from Long Island.)  The narration is so trite and cliched it's almost painful to read.  Attemps at sarcastic humor fall flat; it's like listening to a comedian with poor timing.  There is precious little story here; so little of it that for me to even briefly write what happens would be in itself boring!  Yes, that's how bad it is.   <br /> <br />\\"Aloft\\" is like an imitation of an imitation...or better yet, it's like receiving a fax of a photocopy.  The narration is disingenuous and unrealistic and it's as if Mr. Lee set out to write \\"a John Updike-like novel set in the suburbs.\\"  Somewhere along the way -- well, it was as soon as he started writing -- he lost an original voice. <br /> <br />But the bone I have to pick is not with Chang-rae Lee; it's with the Times.  How could they POSSIBLY have thought this book had any merit?  That is what is so confounding and also so infuriating.  Are they themselves so removed from reality (by this I mean REAL reality, the way people truly live and truly are, NOT the way that novels present them as living) that they take this for real?!  Do they think this is an accurate portrait of the way the world is?  If that's so, that is a crying shame.  One wonders if book reviewers read too many books instead of living lives and meeting real, honest-to-God humans.  \\"Aloft\\" is not one iota more an accurate description of life in the suburbs or in America than watching the same game of checkers being played. <br /> <br />One more thing.  The dialogue.  This too is a sham.  Read several pages of dialogue in this book and then, the next day at work or at home or wherever, listen to strangers or friends talking.  It will not sound anything like this, I guarantee you.  Thank God, but Americans do not sound so hackneyed.  Now, turn on a TV program (a drama or even a sit-com) and listen: THIS is what it will sound like.	2005-02-17

He is a poor writer and has only his material to work with; if not for the facts of his childhood he wouldn't ever have written a book.  His sentences are simplistic, childish, he has no distinct style to speak of at all and his imagination is utterly impoverished.  I was taken in by all the hype.  It's no wonder he's compared to Sedaris; neither writer has an edge.  Reading them both is like shaving with a dull razor.	2004-05-26

And I read (but could barely finish) The Havana Room. It's sort of heartbreaking when you discover a novelist you think you like and then you have to watch his or her talent wane with every new effort. The Havana Room was just too preposterous to be believed; Harrison's novels are frequently described as &quot;potboilers.&quot; I can only say that he desperately needs to come up with new ingredients to throw into the stew...and maybe he shouldn't have the fire turned up so high.<br />I do not understand, though, why this book is getting so much attention and so much hype.  Why would a novel of this nature be reviewed on the front page of the Times' Arts section? Why are reviewers glossing over the ridiculous plot and the unbelievable characters? Could it possibly be because Harrison was once an editor at Harper's and is now an editor at Scribner? It's disheartenting to know that in the publishing world, connections--and not talent--are everything.	2004-01-09

The bravery of the men who fought on Iwo Jima and the subsequent story of the men who raised the flag is one that must be told--unfortunately James Bradley is not the man to tell it. His writing detracts from the the tale and is so bad and so hackneyed that it is almost an insult to the men about whom he's writing. Bradley's choppy sentences are the stuff of teenagers or college freshmen, and I'm not surprised that this book was rejected by several publishers. Someone should have purchased the idea from Bradley and then hired a much, much better author to flesh it out. If there is a cliche that Bradley doesn't use in Flags of Our Fathers, it's merely because he hadn't heard it yet. I could not help but think, as I was reading it, that the author had movies in mind, not just movies he'd seen but a movie that might be made of the book he was writing.	2003-11-10

This book would not have been published if Trillin didn't write for the New Yorker; I dare say no editor would have even finished reading the manuscript. It is not only a book without an edge, it is a book without a point (other than to enhance the author's income). Trillin is a decent (no, much better than decent actually) writer when he's writing about food but that's about it.  He should stick to steak, ribs and sauces and forget about minds, souls and emotions.  If anybody doubts the veracity of these statements, he or she should read Trillin's portrait of R.W. Apple in the New Yorker, perhaps one of the most uncritical puff pieces ever published. He may as well have been handed money by Apple and the Times.<BR>Yes, I finished this novel but it was solely for the enjoyment of disliking it.<BR>Any bets on whether this book will even be in print in five years?	2003-09-24

But this book just doesn't work. It seems a mishmash of different parts and seems haphazardly, even lazily written. Waugh seems to get bored of his protagonist Guy Crouchbook toward the end and dumps him to follow other characters, characters recently introduced to us and who we don't particularly care about. Although the Crete scenes are nicely done, we just want to get them over with. This book isn't half as good as the first part of the trilogy and, I hate to say it, if it wasn't Waugh it would almost certainly not be in print today.	2003-08-04

I wonder if the author, or his editor, knew this but there was just no salvaging it.  <br />Still, I recommend the book, slightly and with reservations; Shteyngart seems to be one of those authors that critics adore who masks a less than stunning talent with a tangy but shallow cleverness (see &quot;Everything is Illuminated&quot; and Dave Eggers). They inject so much cleverness into their sentences, twist and contort and suffuse them with so much filling, that, when the book is taken as a whole, the characters are as thin as the paper they're printed on.  What motivates Vladimir here is, ultimately, Shteyngart's need to be witty; that is what motors what passes for a story...and it just isn't much to go on. Vladimir ends up being a concoction, a compilation, rather than a human being.<br />But what does Shteyngart care what I or others think? Probably not much.  But he really ought to learn the difference between craft and being crafty.	2002-07-30

Herzog never becomes a fully realized character and it's impossible to care about him or, ultimately, this novel.  Herzog seems, to me, a vehicle for the author to spout; at times he is just a mouthpiece to show off how much the author has read.  That makes the main character almost literally paper-thin.  The end happens so abruptly that one would think that he missed something somewhere, or that 20 pages were cut out.  But by that time, anyway, we've stopped caring.  I maintain that, had this book not been written by Bellow, it would no longer still be in print.  I would say that this is a minor work by a somewhat overrated author.  If you haven't read The Adventures of Augie March or Seize the Day, do so.  If you have, then skip this book.	2001-11-15

Orwell went to Spain as somewhat of a vaguely committed leftist; when he returned, he had truly found not only himself but the course of the remainder of the century.  Orwell discovers that things rarely exist in black and white but in a million shades of gray; there rarely is a &quot;good side&quot; in any contest. Tyranny is tyranny whether it wears the swastika or the hammer and sickle.  Another aspect of this book, for people who only know Orwell through Animal Farm and 1984, is his bravery.  He was right in the thick of everything and lived to write one of the truest, most searing documents of the last 100 years.  As a chronicle of war before WWII, I think it ranks with Graves's Goodbye to All That.  In both books, the writer plummets to the depths of human experience and fear and surfaces with enlightenment.	2001-11-12

I think Hornby began to lose it a little with About a Boy; I found that book to be without any edge and just a little bit too precious.  But with How to Be Good, Hornby loses much credulity.  Without giving away any of the plot I'll just say that the plot is not believable.  Hornby does a great job with his female narrator and when he/she is explaining the rotten state of her marriage, nothing rings false.  But when the &quot;motor&quot; of the book begins, the bottom falls out; after this, the book is a tough read -- why go on reading what will happen when none of what is happening seems remotely true?  It's a shame; this could have been a much, much better book had not Hornby stretched us to the limits of reason.  However, he is discerning, clever and unpretentious enough to rebound.	2001-10-29

He really has become almost a parody of himself.  Perhaps he knows that he is incapble of receiving a negative review, so he feels he can just ease back and write what only APPEARS to be an important novel.  Yes, the book has some bite, but it's ultimately empty: it's bite for the sake of bite alone, with nothing behind it whatsoever.  Hopefully, Martin Amis will start being Martin Amis again rather than just a washed-out copy.  His best book is &quot;Money&quot; and that was ages ago.  He had fire in his belly then, had a point to make.  Now the whole point is pointlessness itself.	2001-04-27

I thought that The Disapperaing Floor would be Dixon's masterpiece, but I was wrong. The Missing Chums is the forgotten gem of 20th century writing, on a par with  Joyce, Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald. Dos Passos. Of particular interest here are the characters Chet, Tony and Iona; what other novelist could have written them so vividly, filled them with such life! The town of Bayport is Dixon's microcosm of the universe, its good and evil, its love and hate, heaven and hell.  What Dublin is for Joyce, this village is for Dixon. When all is said and done, I feel that Missing Chums will be ranked with Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises. Like those great novels, this book must be read and read again!	2000-11-24
