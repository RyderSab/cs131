He writes about success principles that he and others have used to become leaders and build cooperative relationships.  I can tell a differece in how people respond to me since trying to use these principles.  People smile back and are much friendlier.  One reason I think this book is so successful is because the concepts are very simple.  For the most part, all of his principles can be found under, \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\"  If one tries to understand how their actions are going to make others feel before they act, they have gone a long way to winning friends and influencing people.  Another thing that I like about Carnegie's book is that it is all based on sincerity.  All of the advice he gives provide win/win situations.  Nobody loses; he does not try to manipulate or deceive people.  I believe Carnegie had an honest interest in people and wanted everyone to acheive to their highest ability.  The principles in this book helps one help others as well as help oneself.  Truly a fantastic book.	2005-09-15

I guess my favorite part is that it wasn't approaching 1000 pages.  Anything I can finish in a couple days is good and not too long.  That I finished it in a couple days also tells me I found New Spring interesting and entertaining.  New Spring encouraged me to reread the entire series, and I am currently bogged down in Path of Daggers.  So, I would also say that New Spring must be much better written than the more recently released Jordan novels.<br /><br />New Spring offers a glimpse at Moraine, Suian and Lan twenty years before we see them in the Eye of the World.  I also enjoyed the glimpse of Elaida being Elaida back in the early days.  Sometimes I feel that Jordan overdoes the details on the customs of different nations, but reading about Lan and Malkier's history was interesting.  I recommend this book to anyone who read Path of Daggers because New Spring is much better.	2005-08-16
US	45986774	R1NCBZ3R0KM8I8	0345444884	122553244	The Talisman	Books	4	2	4	N	N	An amazing novel	I haven't read more than ten Stephen King novels, but this one is different from any others I have read.  Additionally, it is one of the most unique and best novels I have read for its genre.  I really enjoyed this novel.  One thing a reader can count on King to do is to make the reader feel the characters' emotions.  In this novel he does an excellent job of making me feel like I am Jack.  The plot and action are intense, and I couldn't put it down; I finished the novel in three days.  King is a writer who can take the reader into the story.<br /><br />What happens.  There are two worlds that are almost mirror images of each other, and what happens in one generally, in a round about way, happens in the other.  Jack Sawyer is trying to save his mom in one world and a queen in another.  Jack faces many ordeals as he crosses the country trying to find a cure for his mother.  When Jack reaches California, the novel really heats up; especially inside the house.  The details King pays attention to make this novel gripping, and I think this novel may have the most climatic conclusion I have read by him.<br /><br />One of the things I like about this novel is how well King writes it from a child's perspective.  It is definetly different than any other novel I have read, and that, in this case, makes it spectacular.	2005-08-15
US	45986774	R36WU8K8WK9C56	1880418622	871670140	The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, Book 7)	Books	4	3	7	N	Y	An amazing novel	The first four novels made this a great series.  The reason I give this novel four stars is because, although not as good as the first four, it was orders of magnitude better than the 5th and 6th novels in the series.  The way Stephen King writes is his own.  He has an amazing ability to make me feel the characters emotions.  However, in the last three novels of the Dark Tower Series, it didn't feel as real as in the past.  It is as though he had a vision in mind for the first four novels, and it changed when he began writing the next three.  The story became less about the characters he had created, and more about his difficulties in finishing the series.  I hated that, who writes themselves into a fictional novel.  I wish he would have wrote an epilogue on how hard it was for him to finish the series instead of killing Jake and writing himself into the story.  But the novel,<br />  What happens.  Roland reaches the Dark Tower.  Everyone but him is lost.  I do remember that I had a desire to finish this novel.  I read 5 and 6 because I had too, I finished 7 because I felt the ending was gripping.  Maybe not the Crimson King part or Mordred's death, but Roland rushing toward his destiny.  It was the finish that brought back memories of the earlier novels, I could feel Roland's horror on the top floor.  Additionally, I do like how Flagg died in his arrogance.<br />  The sadness I feel is in that while I will probably read the first four novels of the Dark Tower series again, I won't read its ending again.	2005-08-12

Robert Fagles uses quite a bit of freedom in translation, but it is still good.  The first play is Antigone.  This is about a girl who buries her brother against the command of the king.  Even though she is engaged to the king's son, he sentences her to death.<br /><br />The second play is Oedipus the King.  In this drama we learn about Antigone's father, Oedipus.  This is the first detective story.  Oedipus is out to find the man bringing a curse on Thebes, only to discover he is the curse.<br /><br />The third play is Oedipus at Colonus.  This play is about Oedipus after his exile.  One can tell that this play was written at a different time by Sophocles because the characters have changed very much.<br /><br />For me, one of the most fascinating things about all these novels is the way they provide us to look at the past.  By looking at the values held by the people in these plays, we learn about the cultural beliefs of the ancient Greeks.  In addition, they really are good drama, and Fagles translation is very easy to read.	2004-12-02

The story is awesome and the translation by Albert Cook is great.  This novel is great because it gives us a look at what ancient Greece was like.  They valued marriage, they expected women to stay at home, that men would die in battle, on the sea, or raiding other people, and also that something that was unexplainable was due to the gods.<br /><br />This novel is a great adventure.  The Odyssey begins by showing Odysseus to us through the words of Meneloas and Nester.  Then we are brought to Odysseus and learn his plight.  We see him released after seven years of living with a goddess.  When he is rescued again, we learn of his voyages since leaving Troy and the reason that one particular god is so angry with him.  Once his story is told, his rescuers bring him to his fatherland.  He then takes vengence on those who had ravaged his home while he was away, and he is reunited with his faithful wife Penelope.<br /><br />As well as being a great insight to Greek life, this novel is a great story that I look forward to reading again.  I highly recommend it.	2004-10-01
US	45986774	R2DBICR3DC61HF	0865163529	850897190	The Epic of Gilgamesh	Books	5	1	3	N	N	An amazing novel	The Epic of Gilgamesh is an amazing piece of literature.  The tablets repeat themselves, and the flow is often hard to follow, but the story is awesome.  I like the time period it is from.  The Assyrian myth gives a glimpse of what life was like in 2500 BC.  I also found the similarities between the Bible and the Epic engaging.  In the Bible, Adam and Eve were downcast at leaving their nakedness and the garden of Eden, while in the Epic, Enkidu was civilized and gratefully left behind his nakedness and lack of knowledge.  I think there also might be parallels with the snake in Genesis and the snake in the Epic.  And the similarities between the two flood stories is unmistakeable.  A great read, a quick read.  I recommend it to all fans of mythology.<br /><br />What happens.  Gilgamesh needs to be restrained, so the gods send Enkidu.  Enkidu and Gilgamesh become like brothers and go off to fight the god Humbaba.  With the help of their god Shamash, the defeat the god.  But Ishtar is enraged at Gilgamesh's refusal of her, and looses the bull.  Enkidu and Gilgamesh slay the bull, but one of them must die.  The ending is a dirge for the one who is slain.	2004-09-08

I sold books door to door for 12 weeks.  I don't know if it is possible to comprehend inspirational books until you fail at something.  I thought inspirational books were great before the summer, but not until I began selling books door to door did I realize the true meaning of \\"Persist until you succeed,\\" or \\"Quitters never win and winners never quit.\\"  I like the book.  I read each chapter six times, one each week.  I used the topics as positive affirmations.  I found it necessary to feed my mind as well as my body because I found I become irrational when I fail at something.  I also liked the story part of the book.  I can't wait to read the sequel.	2004-08-21

The novels have begun moving at a rapid pace.  Although I do not love the way King inserts himself into the novel, it works.  As always, though, King is able to create in depth characters.  Through dialogue and actions, King paints a vivid picture of Mia, daughter of none, mother of one.  I like how the contract Rand and Eddie draw up presents itself in the when of Jake and Pere.  There is something different about the novels, I think.  The first four seem different than the last two.  They are both good, but it almost seems like the characters have changed or the writing style is different.  I still like the new books.<br /><br />  What happens?  It begins with the search for Susannah.  They reach the cave.  Not only must they rescue Susannah, they must find and protect Cal Tower.  We then follow the adventures of Susannah, and learn much of Mia.  Then Rand and Eddie escape near death and search for the book dealer and wordslinger.  Jake and Pere prepare to meet death as they decide to rescue Susannah.  Susannah awaits her baby's delivery.<br /><br />  The novel is awesome, if a bit of a cliffhanger.	2004-08-21

Who is the most important person in the world to you?  You are.  I determine how I react to every situation.  I determine if I view problems as oppurtunities.  It is up to each individual to make every occasion a great occasion.  This book is awesome, and is probably the best motivational book I have read.  The best self motivator I know, &quot;God is always a good God.&quot;  My next favorite self motivator is &quot;Whatever the human mind can conceive and believe, the human mind can achieve with a positive mental attitude.&quot;<br />I love reading the stories of other people who made a positive mental attitude work for them.  I have also found that action does over rule emotion.  The Do It Now section was also good.  Instead of putting things off, I Do It Now.  I plan on reading this book again, but until I do I always remember that I control whether a situation is good or bad.  This is the most influential book I have read, and I recommend it to everyone.	2004-05-05

In preparation I have been reading books that I think will help me.  So some of the ideas he talks about were harder for me to relate to, but he explains everything really well.  The first part of the book, identifying which breed you are, was the most difficult for me to figure out, because I haven't tried to sell anything yet.  But the rest of the book, I enjoyed immensely.  My sales manager has been talking to me about dealing with rejection and objections, and Singer goes into great detail about how to deal with both.  Additionally, Singer stresses the importance of a positive outlook.<br />Some of this book was over my head, but I plan to read it again at the end of the summer.  Even though some of it was hard for me to relate to, he did a great job explaining what it takes to be a successful salesman.  He also does a great job of building anticipation for a career in sales.  The book is well written and easy to read.	2004-04-22

I think the number one key to getting a lot out of books like this is having an open mind.  This book has some pretty incredible ideas and if you aren't open minded about them, you will probably scoff at them.  So this was like my fourth or fifth book on the topic of thinking and changing your life.  I highly recommend it, and I am already implementing his stragies and suggestions into my life.<br />The most important for me was finding a desire.  Then using autosuggestion.  I am planning tor read the novel again to make sure I understand it.  But the basic theme of the novel is to find a desire, state it clearly, mentally prepare yourself to achieve it, and do not let fear stand in the way of you achieving your desire.	2004-04-12
US	45986774	RWP4F5Q4MKSUF	0451169514	380266608	It	Books	5	0	2	N	N	An amazing novel	This was one of the most frightening books I have read.  There were nights I went to sleep with my door open so light could pour in.  From the beginning the horror and suspense build.  After some passages I would put down the book and think about what I had just read.  The thought was, &quot;This is some scary stuff.&quot;  Most of the scenes with Pennywise are just mind boggling.  When Ben is back in the library after the reunion, that was incredible.  Even the beginning with George, the whole book was great.<br />This novel is about some power or supernatural being that dwells in Derry.  This being is evil and feeds on humans, mainly children, and then it sleeps.  A group of friends hurt It 27 years ago, but It has returned.  They must find a way to hurt or kill It again.  But the magic of a group of children has been lost, and It is prepared for them.<br />The way Stephen King writes characters is amazing.  He brings you into the mind of Beverly's husband Tom, and he recreates the minds of children better than anyone else I have read.  Maybe it is the way he writes characters that makes It so good, but whatever he did in making this novel, it is amazing.	2004-03-20

How he starts every chapter with something relevant, but from a different point of view is cool.  But on the whole, he has much writing the bores me.  The first novel was really good.  This novel also had a really good plot.  There were points where I could not put the book down.  But then there were times I was wondering why I was reading.  Then again, I am not the interested in science fiction novels, and look more for excitement.  There were interesting topics that simply lacked excitement.<br />What happens.  Ender has survived many years by space travel.  He leaves his sister Valentine to go to a new planet where they have discovered a new race of beings with intelligence similar to humans.  He wants to keep the human race from destroying the pequennos and he wants to help a young girl whose role model was murdered by the piggies.  He arrives twenty two years after the murder took place to discover another murder had taken place and that the people of Lusitania were breaking the rules.  Rebellion or submission to the Starways council are the peoples choices.  Ender is the Speaker for the Dead.<br />An okay novel, but one I will probably never read again.	2004-03-05
US	45986774	R34KXWXCK2MJ00	0671039741	165977133	'Salem's Lot	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An amazing novel	Stephen King wrote another masterful novel.  I first read Stephen King when a friend of mine recommended that I read the Gunslinger.  Since that time I have come to enjoy Stephen King's novels.  I read this novel after reading Wolves of the Calla.  'Salem's Lot goes into more detail about Father Callahan.  I wanted to learn more about Callahan and at the same time I got to read a great story.  King makes use of excellent imagery and character description. I think it is one of King's trademarks to draw the reader into the novel.  He goes through a normal of the town.  He shows how character's think.  The first part of this novel allows the reader to feel the setting.<br />What Happens?  Ben Mears comes back to 'Salem's Lot to exercise some past demons.  Initially we meet many of the citizens, and Ben falls in love with one of the residents.  He also meets a down to earth teacher.  He and the teacher begin to notice odd things are happening in the town.  And at the same time, new residents have moved into the abandoned house of a devil worshipper.  Mark Petrie is a young boy who has one of his friends taken, and joins the teacher, Ben, and Ben's girlfriend against the Evil Force.  Eventually they summon the aid of Father Callahan and Jimmy Cody, a doctor.<br />If any of you also have read the Dark Tower, did you find it interesting that both Ben's girl and Roland's girl were named Susan.  And that Ben's Susan had a mom who acted like Roland's Susan's Aunt.  I thought this was a great novel and encourage everyone to read it.	2004-02-22

Scott Fitzgerald, and I really enjoyed it, although the story was sad.  I liked how he wrote the story from the observations of a neighbor. I like the way he wrote the novel.  I could picture some of the events and conversations taking place.  This novel painted a picture that seemed more real to me than many other novels I have read.  The plot was also good.<br />What happened? Nick Carraway was the neighbor to Jay Gatsby.  Gatsby owns a large house and throws extravegant parties.  His ambition is to have his former love, who is now married, attend one of his parties, and so renew their former relationship.  The women Gatsby loved has an unfaithful husband and some of the novel deals with his mistress.  There are also many twists in the novel, that kept me interested and allowed me to finish the book in one night. I encourage you to read this book.  It is not long and is very well written.	2004-02-15

The overall plot in this novel did not really interest me, because I do not care that much for science fiction, but the way this novel was written still made it one of the best books I have read.  Orson Scott Card constantly wove unexpected events into the novel.  Card also wrote in a way that I could sympathize with a young boy, yet still be amazed by his genius.<br />What is this novel about?  The humans have twice been attacked by alien bugs and have become a single league of nations to protect themselves.  They have a fleet to protect earth, a fleet of space ships.  They have developed weapons more deadly than any now in existence.  But the bugs have greater numbers and probably better technology.  The humans need a leader, and they have been breeding geniuses trying to get that leader.  The novel is about the training they put Ender, through.  I liked the situations he was put in, as well as the training he went through; I enjoyed reading about it.  Once he turns eleven, he is sent to command school to learn how to lead the fleet, and then the novel gets good.<br />I recommend this novel, even if you, like me, have never read science fiction before.	2004-02-12

This is the only one of his books I've read where there is an all knowing narrator.  That said, I like this book even more because it deals with one of the characters in the Dark Tower Series, Flagg.  This novel reveals many facts about Flagg.  That he is a demon, that he likes to see the destruction of kingdoms and order.  It also makes him appear strangely mortal.  He is a demon that has lived seemingly forever, yet he is often scared of what humans can accomplish.<br />This novel is about a peaceful kingdom, during the reign of a less intelligent man.  By chance, his first son turns out to be of amazing quality, while his second son seems exactly like himself.  For Flagg to bring about the ruin of Delain he must make the second son, Thomas, King instead of the first son, Peter.  If he could accomplish that feat, the kingdom of Delain would be on the brink of crumbling in four years, after standing for thousands.<br />I recommend this book to anyone, but especially to fans of the Dark Tower.	2004-02-11

Stephen King has created a parralell world with admirable people.  Roland Deshain is an incredible character.  He knows much about his world, yet realizes he can't know everything.  He has achieved an almost superhero status in my mind, but yet he may be destroyed by the aging of his body.  Eddie is another character that I like.  He has overcome an addiction and is in complete control of himself.  He can think for himself and does not fear what he can not affect.  King has created a world full a vivid characters, and the Wolves of the Calla has added even more.<br />What Happens?  We learn a little more about Roland's past and the end of his orginal ka-tet with Alain and Cuthbert.  We also learn a little bit more about Roland's world and it's decay.  There is major character development with the four major characters, and a priest is introduced.  This novel ends with a twist I could never have expected, and I can only wonder what King plans to do with it.  But the majority of the novel deals with the town of Calla Byrn Sturgis.  This town is plauged by wolves that still children.  The seek aid and succor from Roland and his Gunslingers.<br />I highly recommend this novel and Salem's lot.  I haven't read Salem's Lot yet, but I am going to buy Salem's Lot soon.	2004-02-07

It has given me the plan to apply to my motivation.  The advantages of investing in real estate are amazing and this book shows many of them. I read this book after reading four of the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, and must say I enjoyed the change.  While Robert T. Kiyosaki gives reasons for getting wealth and motivation to gain wealth, Robert Allen actually puts forth a plan for gaining wealth.  This book is about strategy.  Allen has a plan that worked for him, and he shares it with us.  Buy real estate, three bedroom houses, and rent them.  After ten years, buying two houses a year, one could have a million dollars in equity.  I also like the way he writes.  His style is entertaining and exciting.  He loves what he does, and it comes across in his writing.  Additionally, he gives tips on finding the right houses, the right neighborhoods, the right sellers, the right financing, and the right tenants.  I encourage you to buy and read this book, because I think you will read it more than once.	2004-02-02

Books	5	4	8	N	Y	An enlightening novel	I beleive this could be the best of the Rich Dad Series books that I have read.  The first part of this book explains why a stock market crash may be coming.  And the explanation is simple and easy to understand.  The stock market goes up because people put money in, by law.  Also by law, those people must begin withdrawing money from their 401k when they turn seventy.  When millions of Americans turn seventy, more money might be coming out of the stock market than is going in.  But the rest of the book is about what we can do to be financially free.<br />You need control over yourself, control over your emotions, control over your excuses, control over your vision, control over the rules, control over your advisors, control over your time, and control over your destiny.  I like his message of hope after his prediction of gloom.  It does not take much to change your financial future.  And now I am going to quote a saying I heard once, that Robert hasn't used yet (Not in the books I've read).  When it comes time to make a decision there are three choices.  To decide yes, to decide no, or to decide not to decide.  I believe many people have unconsciously decided not to decide, but by reading these books, and following the advice he gives, you are deciding to take responsibility for your financial future.<br />I like this book, and I like his writing style.  I recommend this book, especially if you have read and liked his previous books.	2004-01-24

I also have read Rich Dad Poor Dad, and Cashflow Quadrant.  The first two books were exciting to read, the information in them is priceless.  But this is the book where I finally realized the power of what I think.  There is one particular line that I remember especially, First identify what I am afraid of, then ask myself what I want instead, then ask myself how to get it.  As he says repeatedly, it is not the content that matters as much as the context.  I don't know if I really understand all the stuff about leverage.  But what is more important than that, is that I limit me.  My thoughts limit what I do, and they also allow me to retire young and rich.  I don't know how someone can't like these books unless they are a cynic, arrogant, or lazy.  I encourage you to buy this book and read it.  And then read it again like I am going to do.	2004-01-20

I am able to understand what he is talking about and why it is important.  This is his second book. I think the first one is like a wake call, or a warning.  This second book begins to explain what individuals need to do to become financially free.<br />This book talks about the seven levels of investors: Those with nothing to invest, borrowers, savers, &quot;smart&quot; investors, long term investors, sophisticated investors, and capitalists.  Knowing which type of investor you are allows you to see where you need to improve to get to where you want to be.  But one of the biggest themes in this novel is the message to take action now.  The more action one takes, the more they learn, and the more successful they can become.<br />I encourage you to buy this book, because I plan on reading it again and I think if you read it, you will also probably read it again.	2004-01-20

If this is true for you, and you especially need to like the Silmarillion (I have read reviews where people don't like the Silmarillion), then you will enjoy reading Unfinished Tales.  And like all of Tolkien's novels, I recommend buying it, because I believe you will want to read it more than once.  However, this novel is not like his previous novels, or even like the Silmarillion.  This is a collection of short stories and a publication of Tolkien's notes on some items of interest spanning from the Battle of Unnumbered Tears until the destruction of the Ring.  Included are stories on Tour, Turin, Numenor, Eorl, Gandalf, and Saruman.  I can say that reading Unfinished Tales has enriched the world of Middle Earth and I highly recommend it.	2004-01-14

It is not complete like the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, but it is more tragic.  The main part of the novel covers a period of five hundred years condensed into less than four hundred pages.  There is less detail than usual, and some of the material is gone over very quickly.  By reading Unfinished Tales in addition to the Silmarillion, I saw how much information was probably not finished or left out.  Despite the fact that this is one of his shorter works and was released by his son, it is my favorite Tolkien novel.  The tragedy of the elves is very sad and it moved me.  From Feanor to Dior, there was only one or two happy stories.  Beren and Luthien and Gondolin, but even they had sad endings.  I encourage anyone who likes the Lord of the Rings and wants to learn about Middle Earth to read these novels.  But if you want more information about the Lord of the Rings, I think Unfinished Tales has more information about the time period of the War of the Ring.<br />I like this novel and highly recommend it.	2004-01-02

The Return of the King is the most suspenseful of the trilogy for a couple of reasons.  The first, it is the climax.  The second is the order of events.  The Two Towers ends with Frodo captured and Sam trying to rescue him.  But the story line is not continued until the battle at Minas Tirith is resolved.  And the battle at Minas Tirith is exciting as well.  When Tolkien finally returns to Sam and Frodo, he leaves of with the Captains of the West making battle before Mordor.  Just the order of events makes this one of the most exiting books I have read.<br />The story begins with Pippin and Gandalf arriving in Minas Tirith.  Denethor is a proud ruler who has fallen into folly.  Pippin enters Gondor's service and Merry enters Rohan's service.  Merry rides to battle with Dernhelm.  After the battle, the captains ride to Mordor to draw attention from Frodo and Sam.  Frodo and Sam make their way to Oroduin, where Gollum becomes an unlikely hero.  After the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen, the hobbits return to the Shire, where a terrible shock awaits them.  The movie does a nice job, but it was not long enough to include everything.<br />If you're looking at this book, you have probably read the first two, and are ready to get this one.  If you have liked Tolkien's other work, I encourage you to purchase the Silmarillion, which shows the beginning of middle earth through the tragedy of the Nolder.	2003-12-26

The Fellowship of the Rings left the reader hanging, but this novel builds more anticipation than the first.  All I can say is I am glad I already own the Return of the King, so I can begin reading it immediately.  I have read other fantasy novels and there is something about Tolkien's work that isn't in other novels.  I think it is emotion.  I can feel the sadness felt be Gimli when he leaves Lorien.  When Aragorn is on the hill in Lorien and it reads, he never came there again as a living man, I am saddened.  In the Two Towers, I can feel the emotions of Sam at Cirith Ungol.  I guess that is the difference between Tolkien and other fantasy authors.  An author can write a great novel, but it may only stimulate anticipation and excitement.  Tolkien creates anticipation and excitement while stimulating other emotions.<br />What Happens.  It begins at the Rauros.  With Sam and Frodo gone, the remaining members of the fellowship seek those taken captive.  The pursuers reach Rohan in time of peril and find one they do not expect.  They ride with Theoden and Eomer to Helm's Deep to make battle with Sauraman's Orcs.  Wormtongue deals a heavy loss to his master.  Book four begins with Smeagol joining Sam and Frodo.  They journey first to the black gates and then to Cirith Ungol.  They meet Faramir along the way, but he does not detour them.<br />Tolkien is the best fantasy author I have read.  I encourage you to purchase this book if you liked the movie, because if you read it once, you will probably read it again.	2003-12-15

Buying Tolkien's novels for people is a great gift because they read them over and over.  I keep reading the series each year because it is that good.  I also recommend reading this novel slowly, because the depth of his writing is amazing.  If one reads slowly, and let Tolkien's words sink in, imagine what he describes, the reader will be taken to a magical place.  Each time I read this novel, I notice something I didn't before, and it is always entertaining.  I noticed this time that in the past, I read to quickly and did not allow myself to see the landscapes he paints.<br />What happens.  The book begins with a continuation of the Hobbit, and Bilbo's magic ring has been found to have a dark past.  The Ring must be destroyed.  But Bilbo passes the ring on before this is known, and the quest is thrust upon his heir, Frodo.  Frodo leaves with his friends and meets elves and Tom Bombadil, before he reaches Rivendell.  The movie leaves out some stuff.  Once Frodo and the other hobbits make it to Rivendell they continue with five others.  Their goal is to destroy the ring, but they must go to Mordor, and the road is long and tough.  The novel ends with the fellowship being broken.  Boromir's horn has not yet sounded.	2003-12-11

Books	5	1	2	N	N	An enlightening novel	~This is one of the most enlightening books I have read in the three years I have spent at college, and it was one I was not assigned to read.  Robert Kiyosaki's book taught me some common myths about becoming rich.  People can work hard all their lives, with high levels of education, and never become rich.  The difference between the rich and the poor and middle class is that the rich buy assets while the poor and middle class buy liabilities.  If you read this book, which I recommend, you won't~~ ever forget that sentence.  He mentions it a few times.  He tells some of his successes, and the strategy behind becoming rich.  He does not necessarily tell you what you have to do to become rich directly, but he outlines the principles.<br />I also like his writing style, which had me laughing at several points throughout the novel.  I especially recommend this book to any young people who don't want to have to work their entire lives.  I like the book, I like his writing style, and I am about~~ to read the rest of his books.  I recommend him.~	2003-12-01

The Hobbit is a much easier novel to read than the Lord of the Rings, and is just as good.  The novel is also more lighthearted and aimed at younger readers.  Tolkein is a masterful story teller, and I could sense the enjoyment he must have felt from telling his stories.  The way he writes, the words he uses, shows the fun he had writing this novel.  However, I feel there is somewhat less excitement in this novel than in the Lord of the Rings.~~  Maybe it is because the Lord of the Rings is longer or has graver consequences.  Anyway, it is still a enjoyable read, and much quicker to finish than the Lord of the Rings.<br />What is it about.  Bilbo Baggins has an adventure, which is quite unusual for Hobbits.  He with a group of dwarves set out to slay the mighty dragon Smaug and recover their treasure.  There are many obstacles in reaching the dragon, and then the must find a way to rid their treasure of its guardian.  Now that I have~~ read the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, one of my favorite parts of reading the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is noting references by Tolkien to Gondolin or Beren or Turgon.<br />If you have seen the movies, and are interested in Tolkien's novels, this is a great one to start with.  His novels are the best fantasy novels I've read.~	2003-11-25

This book is one of the most interesting stories that also examines the character of a man.  Marlow is an older sailor who tells the tale of his time as captain of steamship in Africa.  He works for a an ivory trading company, and his mission is to go up river to Kurtz's station.  Marlow vividly recalls his thoughts and feelings from his trip up the river.  After an introduction to how he~~ came to his position, we join Marlow in Africa as he is awaiting his command.  It is here that he first hears of the extraordinary Kurtz.  The manager, who seems greedy, and his brick layer, who wants to be Assistant manager, don't like Kurtz.  But the more Marlow hears about Kurtz, the more he wants to talk with him.  As he repairs his ship, as he sails up river, his anticipation builds.  Nearing Kurtz's station, I could feel Marlow's angst when he believes Kurtz dead.  The man Kurtz had been~~ was no more.  He had become someone else, a man with power.  The desire for more ivory had possessed him.  In his last words, Kurtz reveals his opinion on life and the relationships therein: &quot;the horror, the horror.&quot;  The story remains one of my favorites.~	2003-10-07

The first novel I read by Joseph Conrad was Heart of Darkness, which was narrated by Marlow.  Lord Jim is also narrated by Marlow, which was an interesting twist.  However, it also made the first 180 pages difficult to follow.  Instead of reading a story, a story is being told to the reader.  But the book is composed of two parts: Marlow telling us the introduction, and Marlow's letter to one who also heard the story the night Marlow told it.  I felt this added something to the novel, making it more thrilling.  The last 60-80 pages flew by, the conclusion was exciting, and then it was over.  I have read three of Conrad's novels, and I like how he finishes them.<br />What happens.  Jim is a sailor who dreams of glory, but falters in his first trial.  He spends time trying to avoid his past and eventually finds himself the guardian of a people in remote India.  When trouble seeks him again, he makes a decision with horrible consequences.  But instead of running from the consequences as he had earlier in his life, he faces them.  An amazing novel.	2003-09-13

The novel started out slowly and was hard for me to understand.  But midway through the second book, Dickens grabbed my attention and did not let go; I finished the last 150 pages in under three hours, while the first 200 took all week.  The old write style is the only difficulty I had enjoying this novel.  The plot is very good.<br />What happens?  The novel is based around the French Revolution.  The first novel deals with the release of Dr. Mannette and his reunion with his daughter.  The second novel deals more with the Doctor's life in England, the interactions of his daughter with Sidney Carton and Charles Darney, and Mr. Lorry's business.  One piece of advice I have is remember every name, no matter how insignificant it seems.  Characters emerge in book three that seemed unimportant.  Darney is a French noble who returns to France to help a servant in danger by the Revolution.  Charles Darney is taken prisoner and book three deals with the year and some months he spends in prison.<br />The novel is excellent and I recommend it to anyone.	2003-08-19

I don't see how so many people can like it and recommend this novel.  The story isn't too horrible, and even the plot isn't too terrible.  But the word selection, sentence structure and syntax is the worst I have read.  Wow, I never knew how often someone could repeat the same phrases and have a novel published.  If I wrote an essay where I said this 'kills' me (he meant amused me) every paragraph, I know my English teacher would fail me.  If half the time I started to describe something, I said, &quot;But I don't feel like telling you about that&quot; or &quot;But I am not in the mood,&quot; my paper would flunk. I never knew how often the word &quot;phony&quot; could be used.<br />I really tried to stay openminded about this book, but by the end of the novel I was no longer enjoying his story because of the writing style.  The story in itself is not that bad; I have read worse.  This boy Holden has just flunked out of his third prep school, and we join him over the next two or three days of his life.  Holden seems to think many people are phony, and I think that the phoniness of so many people must be the point of this novel.  I agree that a lot of people do things because it is what is expected of them, but does that make them phony.  I think that Holden used other people's phoniness as an excuse not to apply himself, because he was not phony like others.<br />Overall, I gave the novel two stars because of its grammer, the plot wasn't too bad.	2003-08-09

I couldn't help but realize this man's genius as I read this book.  His understanding of science is evident and only surpassed by his knowledge of the psychological.  I recognized some of what I read, and believe that &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; must be the original source.  Additionally, the book contains much information I had never heard before.<br />The book is a collection of twelve essays written on how to prevent the world from &quot;Brave New World&quot; from coming into existence.  Already in 1958, Huxley paints a bleak picture for our future.  One of the main problems Huxley forsees is the lack of desire for freedom.  In 1958, a study showed that American youths were indifferent to rule by a few experts instead of a democracy.  He sees a need to increase critical thinking in the individuals of a society.  He also explains the current methods of involuntary mental manipulation.  The &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; is an informative collection of essays that has risen my awareness of psychological dangers.	2003-08-05

I found it deeply interesting and at the same time entertaining.  Following Elliot, Larry, and Isabella's life kept my attention, and yet it was the philosophical discussions that I enjoyed the most.  He clearly showed the hollowness of a life lived only in a pursuit of material pleasure.  Money, Social Status, and things did not create happiness.  The novel also shows the bitterness of spurned love.<br />What happens.  Elliot is wealthy and a gentleman with much class.  His social status matters more to him than anything else, and the patheticness of his life is shown at his death.  Isabella and Larry are originally engaged, but separate.  Larry seeks personal peace, while Isabella seeks materialistic satisfaction.  Larry travels the world searching for inner peace and finds it.  Isabella settles for something less, and lives an incomplete life.  The novel is great, its revelations about life are tremendous.	2003-08-04

It began by reading &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; in a high school English class.  The way he writes is his own.  I have not read another that uses the same style Hemingway does.  He is able to portray the lives of others in a way the allows the reader to understand them.  I find his words to be quite similar to actual human experience.  They are not romanticized or unreal.<br />This novel has three parts about Thomas Hudson.  The first is the one I like the most.  It starts out slow, but a fight and a deep fishing scene create excitement, and I couldn't put the novel down.  Hemingway, a master of tragedy, creates another tragic ending.  The second part is not the great, but not that bad.  It deals with his life during the war and a reunion with his first wife.  The third part reminds me off &quot;For Whom the Bells Toll&quot; because it seems more action packed than the rest of the novel.  The first two parts are based on human interaction, while the third is a chase at sea for a German U-boat crew.<br />This is a great novel and I highly recommend it if you like Hemingway.	2003-07-31

I like the translation.  I have read other translated books where I find it difficult to read the book.  First, I want to say that this is the first military instruction book I have read, and second, that I read this book to find out how people fought before there were weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, I thought this book was an excellent tool in describing ancient military tactics.  But even if you aren't interested in military tactics as much, this book was also interesting because I enjoy history.  I thought it was going to describe how to march, train, and fight, which it did, but it also made numerous references to the actions of past military leaders.  I enjoyed reading about the successes and failures of people whose names I recognized from history class.  Additionally, I enjoyed the style.  Niccolo uses a different style of writing then American authors, and on occasion I like to read something different.  It is a good book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys learning about history.	2003-07-26

I have believed in Christ since I was young, but I have never known much about the historical evidence around Christianity.  I didn't know where the new testament came from, I thought it had always been.  Lee Strobel showed me where the New Testament came from and why it is so credible.  Additionally, he supported the Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ from sources outside the Bible.<br />My friend recommended this book to me, and I can see the impact it has made on his life.  Before he didn't know for sure if he believed in Christ, but this book helped eliminate his doubt.  I have always been raised in a Christian home and believed in Christ, so for me this novel served another purpose.  I always accept what the Bible says, but within days of reading passages of this book, people from work or friends would ask me questions about what I had just read.  Weeks earlier I would have been unable to answer their questions, but because I read his book, I was able to defend the New Testament.  I am glad I read this novel.	2003-07-12

Jordan did an excellent job with what he wrote. I found it all interesting and most of it exciting. My only complaints are that he did not deal much with Rand, and he never delevoped the plot of any other character very far. I have to agree with others that the next book is going to be very good. His last two novels are a return to his earlier novels, in that, I am enjoying his novels again.<br />What happens. The prologue seems like it contains hundreds of new plots, but really only a few. Mat and those with him leave Ebou Dar and journey north. Mat and Tuon's relationship begins to grow. Elayne is attempting to secure the throne, although little of the novel deals with her. Egwene has begun her siege of Tar Valon and is forming wrong conclusions about Rand. I think most of the novel actually deals with Perrin and his efforts to rescue his wife. He finds the camp of seventy thousand Shaido where his wife is being held. Logain and Bashere join Rand in Tear.<br />My overall opinion is this is a good novel by itself. If Jordan can get his next novel out in a year, it will be a great novel, because it is a crossroads. The series has gained something that wasn't there before. I am anticipating his next novel again.	2003-06-14

Wow, is this the same author.  I didn't get bored at all reading Winter's Heart (I've learned to skip worthless descriptions that have no effect on the plot).  The material of this novel, may be the strongest since The Fires of Heaven.  I never felt like there were dull moments.  Some parts of the novel were less exciting than others, but he kept the pace of the novel never slowed.  In The Path of Daggers I would read 200 pages and wonder why, that never happenned to me while reading Winter's Heart.<br />I really like this novel because Mat Cauthon seems to be the focus of it.  Additionally, each individual plot leaves you ready to read more.  He never writes through Egwene, but he gives us hints about what is happening with her.  The plots concerning Elayne, Perring and Mat are left with a great deal in doubt.  I am going to start Crossroads of Twilight today and I can't wait to see how Jordan resolves their situations.  This is the novel Jordan needed to write after The Path of Daggers.  I almost forgot one of the best parts.  Rand accomplishes something major.	2003-05-26

The Path of Daggers is amazing, in that, in 672 pages, nothing happens. I finished A Crown of Swords two weeks ago, and felt like Jordan hadn't lost his touch yet. This novel, however, did disappoint me. First, Mat Cauthon is not mentioned, and he is my favorite character. That was my greatest dismay, almost 700 pages without the most interesting character. Additionally, the first half of the novel is very slow. I don't think Rand is mentioned in the first two to three hundred pages. Once he is the novel speeds up, but it is too late. Reading about Elayne and Nynaeve was not interesting. I think the developments with Egwene are interesting, but definetly not exciting. Usually Jordan writes into great depth in the beginning of the novel, but saves the novel by having a great ending. This is the first Wheel of Time novel, that lacked that Jordan ending, which helps readers forgive his sometimes sluggish pace.<br />The novel did have several bright spots though. For the first time since book three, the parts of the novel concerning Perrin and Faile did not annoy the hell out of me. Maybe it was just that they were in between boring stories, but I actually looked forward to reading about them. That has never happened before. Additionally, Jordan has set up Egwene's future beautifully, and the parts of the novel concerning Rand aren't bad.<br />What happens. Elayne and Nynaeve journey to Camelyn, escaping the Seachan. Rand battles the Seachan. Perrin and Faile search for the Prophet. Egwene moves toward Tar Valon.<br />Not a great novel, not the worst I have read; just the worst I have read by Jordan.	2003-04-28

A Crown of Swords is the first wheel of time novel that I can remember not focusing almost entirely on Rand.  In previous novels, Jordan writes other plots along with Rand's adventures, but in this novel Jordan seems to write Rand's adventures along with Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve, who I think were the focus of this novel.  Perrin is hardly mentioned, and not much occurs with Egwene.  Jordan places more emphasis on knowing the actions of Elaida and the Forsaken then in previous novels.<br />What Happens.  A new Aes Sedai is introduced, Cadsuane, I think.  Min has a viewing of her, that makes me think we will be seeing much more of her in upcoming novels.  Egwene is on the move, recruiting more men for her army.  Mat, Elayne, and Nynaeve are in Ebou Dar.  They spend months looking for a terangel that will fix the weather.  Lan also reappears in this novel.  Rand attempts to do stuff, but Jordan leaves us in doubt of any real conclusions.  The Shaido are dispersed.  Elaida learns the Black Tower is strong and of Al' Thor's escape, which is not good for her.<br />Again, Jordan hints at Moraines reapperance.  I think this novel was published six or seven years ago.  This time the hint comes from Min saying her viewing about Moraine was the only one she was ever wrong about.  The other hint that came about ten years ago was one of Egwenes dreams.  This was still a strong novel, but the pace continues to slow and Jordan continues his trend of introducing new characters who annoy me.	2003-04-14

The ending is one of the most dramatic he has written.  I even think the bulk of the book has a stronger plot than the books four or five.  Jordan still writes annoying conversations between Nynaeve and Elayne, but they seem to be doing something important for the first time....ever.  Perrin character seemed to completely change.  I don't think Jordan has the same mindset for him in book six as he did in book one, but Perrin and Failes parts of the novel were also better written than usual aside from Perrin's conversation with Faile's father.  I also enjoyed the increased focus on Matrim Cauthon.  He is becoming the most interesting character.  And the best part of the novel is that we no longer have to read about Aveindha sharing Rand's bed chamber.<br />What happens.  Rand travels around, and the black tower is created.  Rand doesn't accomplish much beside learning not to trust Aes Sedai.  Mat is a decoy headed to Fight Sammuel but ends up in Ebou Dar.  Egwene joins Elayne and Nynaeve.  Nynaeve and Elayne make amazing discoveries.  Perrin is pulled to Rand.  Not much really happens.<br />I also noted something about Loial's speech.  He speaks Noun, Verb, Rest of sentence.  Every sentence, that makes him sound different compared to the rest of the novel.  Just an observation.  Good book, I hope the next one is as good.	2003-03-25

I had problems reading the first 500 pages, but after that the novel was great, even the parts concerning Nynaeve and Elayne.  However, the first 500 pages probably took me four times as long to read as the last 480.  They were slow and contained almost no action.  I actually caught myself rereading sentences because I could not understood what they meant.  But even the beginning was really too bad, just not as good as the second half, and the second half more than made up for the beginning.<br />What happens.  Rand chases Coudalin into Cairhien.  Mat is becoming a great general.  Rand's Aiel fight the Shaido.  Moraine fights Lanfear.  Nynaeve fights Moghedian.  Rand fights Rahvin.  Who wins?  The final two hundred pages are jammed packed with action and excitement.  But the best part of the novel is that Faile is only mentioned once.  She is without a doubt the worst character ever created.  This next line is for anyone who has read the novel already.<br />Looking at the copyright date on the cover, it has been ten years since Jordan killed Moraine and probably twelve since Egwene's dream of Thom pulling a blue crystal out of fire.  It's been ten years.  When is something going to happen here.<br />Anyway, this is still a great novel.	2003-03-10

I think the first three novels could be read independently, similar to Tolkien's Hobbit, and still be enjoyed.  However, The Shadow Rising, offers no real conclusion and begins the torture known as the Wheel of Time.  I like the overall plot of this novel; I gave it five stars.  The focus on Rand is good, but I don't understand how he has become so knowledgable and wise over the course of a year.  The side story with Perrin and Faile has great potentail and the ending is awesome, but they way it is written makes me cringe when I read parts of it.  Nynaeve and Elayne are my least favorite part of the novel.  I honestly consider skipping all chapters concerning their part of the plot.  And once again, Mat is my favorite character.  Robert Jordan has created some annoying characters, but Matrim Cauthon redeems them.  And the action in the White Tower is also well done, if not believable.<br />What happens.  The novel begins with Rand holding the Stone of Tear.  He becomes involved with Elayne before leaving the stone for the Aiel Waste.  One of the best parts of the novel occurs when Rand and Mat enter Rhuiden.  He is marked as the chief of chiefs, and begins the unification of the Aiel.  Rand also finds a teacher to help learn Saidin.  Mat journeys with Rand to Rhuiden and stays with him after they leave.  Mats memories return and his luck continues.  Perrin leaves Tear to return to the Two Rivers to save his people from the Whitecloaks.  Instead he fights Trollics and becomes lord of his people.  In the wolf dream Perrin learns a lot about those twisted doors.  From a child's game, &quot;Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to daze, and iron to bind.&quot;  After reading this novel for the third time, I noticed that whenever Mat enters those doors, the snake people always make sure he was no musical instruments, iron, or devices to make light.  Nynaeve and Elayne go to Tanchinco to find something that might hurt Rand and meet a forsaken.  Egwene and Moraine accompany Rand to Rhuiden.<br />This novel, as I remember it, is one of the last real good ones by Robert Jordan.  I like the next ones, but I haven't waited years for them.  I am rereading them on my way to Crossroads of twilight, and if book 10 is disappointing, I will understand why many readers complain about the later novels.  But Book 4 is still fantastic, and while it is not imperative to read the first three before starting the fourth, the first three are the best, so I encourage you to read them first.meet a forsaken.

The strength of the plot is impecable and Jordan moves through it quickly enough that it is exciting.  If you liked the first two Wheel of Time novels, you will love this novel.  I encourage you to read this novel closely, because Jordan reveals the plot of the next novels in three prophcies Moraine mentions.  As of book nine, two of them have been fulfilled, and I can see where the third will be fulfilled.  If you have already read the Wheel of Time, I encourage you to reread the Dragon Reborn because of its importance in the overall plot.<br />What happens.  Rand has declared himself the Dragon Reborn and is being tormented in his dreams.  In an attempt to assure himself of his claim, he sets out to fulfill a prophecy of the Dragon.  He leaves by himself and we see only glimpses of his travel, while we track Rand with Lan and Perrin and watch the search for the Black Ajah with Egwene, Elayne, and Nyn.  I find the most entertaining parts of the novel to be those that concern Mat.  Mat is healed in the White Tower and leaves before he has regained his full strength.  He faces many dangers as he delivers a letter for Elayne and travels to Tear.<br />The novel is amazing.  I have read it three times.  I encourage you to buy it also, because you will likely read it more than once.	2003-02-11

The plot never slows in this novel.  I am honestly amazed by the difference between Jordan's first novels and his latter ones.  He still shifts between multiple plots, but people can still see how they are connected.  Egwene and Nyn leave the White Tower, but they are still involved with what happens to Rand.  What also makes this novel better than some of the later ones is that you can pick this book up and read it without reading the first one.  Somethings may not be clear, but you will still enjoy a good novel.<br />What happens.  Rand feels abandoned by Moraine in Fal Dara and resolves to leave without his friends.  He makes it as far as the stable before he learns he cannot leave.  While he is trapped in the city, trollocs storm the keep; Mat's dagger and the horn of Valere are stolen.  With's Mat's need and the knowledge that the followers of the horn will follow whoever blows it, Rand joins the chase for the horn.  Egwene and Nyn are off to the White Tower, but after three months are off on their own adventure.  The chase for the horn covers multiple countries and starts and finishes wars.  But in the end it is Rand versus the Dark One for the lives of his friends.<br />I cannot do justice to the action or excitement of this novel.  I have read it recently and encourage you to buy this novel, because like me, you will probably read it more than once.	2003-02-07

My only complaint is how much the novel seems to mirror The Lord of the Rings.  Many characters seem similar, along with the characters' homeland known for their tabacco.  The novel also looks long, but only took me a little over a week to read.  The writing is not super, but the plot makes up for it.  I'll give you a small example.  Jordan uses a metaphor comparing a character's movement with a treadmill.  But in the time period they~~ are living in, there are no treadmills.  Additionally the conversations between characters are not realistic sometimes.<br />Despite my reservations, I give the Eye of the World five stars.  One thing I like about the novel and the series is its length.  Tolkien wrote that he had one regret about the Lord of the Rings:  he wished it had been longer.  Readers of the Wheel of Time will not have that complaint.  The action is steady in this first novel, and the plot is interesting.  This is the~~ third time I have read the novel, and therefore encourage you to buy it, because you also will read it more than once.~	2003-01-27

These writings includes the stories of Tour, Turin, Galadriel, the Stewards, Eorl and Rohan, the wizards and other aspects of middle earth.  Christopher Tolkien also provides many footnotes that go into detail about the languages used by Tolkien.  I have read six novels by Tolkien, and consider this to be weakest, but I still gave it five stars.  Unfinished Tales contains information that could not included in the Silmarillion.  Many of the stories add detail to those began in the Silmarillion.<br />If you are considering buying this book, you should know this is not like Tolkien's other books about middle earth.  This is a collection of many stories and legends that do not neccessarily involve each other.  In this work, there is no overall plot.  If you, as I, love Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Silmarillion, then Unfinished Tales provides more information and depth.  If you are looking for a novel about another period in middle earth, then you might be disappointed. Additionally, the second story concerning Turin requires that you have read the Silmarillion.<br />However, this novel gives fans of Tolkien another chance to marvel in his genius and be amazed at his vast creation.  I have just finished reading Unfinished Tales for a third time, and encourage anyone who enjoyed the Silmarillion to buy this book because more likely than not, you will also read it again.	2003-01-20

The Silmarillion is the best tradgedy, better than Shakespeare, that I have read.  The Silmarillion lacks the same tone as the Lord of the Rings since the novel was compiled by JRR Tolkien's son.  His son, however, still did a masterful job.  The Silmarillion is the history of Middle Earth.  <br />The adventures take place when Sauron is but a servant of one more powerful and more evil.  In the beginning there was one who created the Ainur.  Of the Ainur, Melker was the greatest, but he fell from his high position.  Then some of the Ainur came to Middle Earth to shape the creator's vision.  Melker seduced some of the Ainur to his side and was at strife with the others, the Vala.  The Vala chained Melker to protect the Elves.  Then there was bliss until Melkor was released.  Feanor was the greatest of all the Elves, and created the three Simarils.  These Melker stole, and the tragedies that befell the Nolder (Feanor's race) make the Silmarillion.<br />In addition to the wonderful stories, this illustrated hardback copy is very nice.  I already owned the first edition hardback, but I also bought this version.  Tolkien was an awesome author, and this novel does him tribute.	2003-01-02

This novel is so intense I could feel heart pounding.  At the end of book five, where Tolkien returns to Sam and Frodo's journey, I could not put the book down.  I read the remainder of the novel that day.  Suspense keeps building and building until the very end.  I actually find the ending to be sad.  The final pages and parts and appendix seem very sad to me.  I think the appedix is well worth reading.<br />The story of Gandalf and Pippen sets the stage for the battle before Minas Tirith.  The Witch King of Angmar leads his forces to destroy the White City while the men of Umbar sail against the Pelagir.  When all seems hopeless, the Riders of Rohan arrive, and Aragorn walks the Path of the Dead.  Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor even as the last battle is nearing its beginning.  The Nazgul fly from battle as the ring nears its destruction.  Will Frodo and Sam finish their quest?  The suspense is staggering.  <br />The Return of the King is amazing, but if you wish to learn more of Middle Earth, of Beren and Luthien, and of Feanor, read not only the Return of the King, but the Silmarillion as well.	2002-12-06

The first time I read the Lord of the Rings, I thought the Two Towers was the weakest of the three novels.  Since then I have read it again and believe it to be much better than The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Rings.  After I finished reading The Fellowship of the Rings for the second time, I remember thinking, &quot;Hopefully the Two Towers won't be too dull.&quot;  I got my wish.  In fact, each page of the Two Towers built my enthusiasm and anticipation.  I could not put it down.  The Fellowship of the Ring creates a masterful plot, and the Two Towers magnifies it.  <br />The Two Towers recieves it names from the towers of Orthanc and Minus Morgul.  At Orthanc the deeds of Aragorn, Merry, Pippen, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas are performed.  In Rohan they bring about the destruction of Isengard.  The latter part of the novel returns to Frodo and Sam and their journey across Mordor and Ithilien to Minas Morgul.  The book closes with disaster approaching the quest of the ring and war coming to Minas Tirith.<br />Tolkien is an awesome author whose imagination and skill has inspired my own imagination on many journeys.	2002-12-05

This novel reads much easier than Tolkien's later books.  For anyone who hasn't read Tolkien before and has become interested, the Hobbit is a wonderful place to start.  Besides being one of the shortest novels, it also predates The Lord of the Rings, making it chronologically the novel to begin with. <br />The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo is a hobbit who goes and a grand adventure.  Unfortunately, hobbits do not like adventures and Bilbo takes a while becoming comfortable with the situation.  The novel takes place predominantly in three parts.  Tolkien develops his plot over the first part of the novel as the Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo travel to the Misty Mountains.  The second part deals with the adventures reaching the dragon.  And, the third part deals with confrontation of the dragon.  For novels this size, The Hobbit has more detail and plot than any self contained novel I have read.<br />But, I am decidedly biased in favor of Tolkien.  I have read all of his novels at least twice.  The open a world full of tragedy and heros.  The greatest of his work he never published.  However, the Hobbit is the first and inspiration for the Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien was a great author, and in writing the Hobbit wrote a novel that can be enjoyed by all ages.	2002-11-16

There are only two downfalls to this novel.  The first is that I watched the movie.  I kept expecting what happened in the movie to happen in the novel.  I have to tell you, the book is much different from the movie, and the book is better.  The only other negative is that I was raised and taught English in the 1990's and had some difficulty reading Cooper's style of writing.  However, the imagery and detail Cooper uses far out weigh the difficulties in understanding his style.  Being written in English, I could understand everything he wrote, it just took me longer to read.<br />As I alluded to, Cooper did a tremendous job of painting a picture in mind.  I want to visit the Northeastern United States after reading about its beauty.  I immediately noticed the attention he paid to detail compared to more modern authors I have read.  Additionally, I feel Cooper portrayed Native Americans in positive light uncommon to his era.  Rather than berating Native Americans in ignorance, he explained there ways of thinking and ceremonies.  More importantly, he showed that every race has common values.  Foremost of these is love.  The love shared by the chief for his son, the white scout with his Indian friend, the Indian for Cora, all demonstrate that love can touch everyone.  The last pages of this novel had more emotion than any I can recall.<br />I enjoyed reading this novel, and encourage all those who liked the movie or are looking for a good novel to read The Last of the Mohicans.	2002-11-12

I read this book because I heard it had a connection with King's Dark Tower Series.  Second, I have never read the original version.  I think parts of this book were dull and progressed very slowly.  Finally, King writes a note at the beginning of the book warning readers that this is an expansion of the orginal book; providing more detail into the lives of the main characters.  I read the note, and thought, \\"Stephen King can't write a dull book.\\" I proceeded to read the novel thinking his author's note was worthless.  I was wrong.  But the meaning of my third point is: If you have read the original, you will probably love the uncut version.  If you haven't read the original, you will probably think King is leading you in many worthless directions that do not pertain to the story.<br />I feel the Stand has definite potential.  It was a great plot, but the uncut version was one of the longest novels I have read- 1140 pages in paper back.  I am not scared of long novels, I read War and Peace for fun.  But most of the first eight-hundred pages weren't that good.  Sure there were two-hundred pages of great stuff, stuff that won't let you put a novel down.  But then there were six-hundred of semi-pertinent information.  The Uncut version goes from ten pages of amazing writing, to thirty pages of in depth character analysis.  I am sure if I had read The Stand before, I would have found the additional information interesting. But since I started with the uncut version, I was disappointed.<br />The novel has a great plot.  The story about the germ spreading, and the military's reaction were good.  The superflu spreads, killing 99 percent of the world, and our military manages to cover it up for weeks.  That was what I expected from King, exciting and suspensful writing.  Then the story dredges into the lives of each main character.  I think I could tell which parts were needed and which parts King added for the Uncut version.  The lives of Frannie Goldsmith, Stuart Redman, Nick Andros, and Larry Underwood are essential, but all the detail is not.  Then the plot heats up when the survivors begin accumulating under Mother Abigal in Boulder and under Flagg in Las Vegas.  The ending was a little weak, but was still a good novel.<br />Maybe I was disappointed because of my motivation for reading the book.  I wanted to learn about the thinny in Roland's world.  I wanted to know who Mother Abigal and the Walkin Dude were.  Why was Kansas dead, what was the superflu?  I found all those things out, and that was good.  One of King's strengths is his continuity throughout his novels.  I first read about Flagg in the Eyes of the Dragon, then in the Dark Tower Series, and now in The Stand.  Flagg is interesting character, I encourage anyone who hasn't to read the other novels.  So in my Dark Tower withdrawal, I read the Stand and found it was not a Dark Tower Series book.<br />But I finished 1140 pages, I think that speaks enough for the novel.dded for the Uncut version.

I have never read an author whose style matches his.  As his style, so his stories: unique and captivating.  This novel presented a look at life that has now passed away.  Why is this book good?  Because Hemingway describes feelings that occur in everyones lives.  Because Hemingway portrays so many personalities of society correctly.  This story is about life and circumstances mold our lives.<br />Cohn has been dominated most of his life.  He attempts to escape that domination and is crushed.  Boxing could not save him and neither could love.  Mike lives a blissful life without care of money or whether he has any.  He allows his temper to show, and it gets in the way of his happiness.

I suppose I have read novels from cover to cover in one sitting before, but I don't remember doing so with a novel this large before. This novel is that good. I remember thinking, I will just see how this part plays out and then go to bed, I went to sleep four hours later. This novel has so many plot twists it scared me. I was sure Paul was managing fine, then she revealed everything she knew, and wham, Paul lost some appendages. Then I thought I had figured Annie out, and wham, she does the total opposite of what I anticipated. This novel did something only one other novel has ever done, it allowed me to feel Paul's terror, hope, and arrogance as my own terror, hope(lessness), and arrogance. I think I even trembled with fear during passages of the book. Aside from the Dark Tower Series, I feel this is the best King novel I have read.<br />What happened. Paul broke both his legs in a car crash. Annie Wilkes rescues him. Maybe rescue is the wrong word, she prolonges his life. She nurses his recovery using her secret stash of drugs, iv's, and splints. However, she forgets to notify authorities of Paul's stay with her. Paul initially has the strength to resist her and fight for his freedom, over the next months, he loses that strength. The main problem is that Annie is mentally ill. She sees only what she wants and ignores other possibilities. This is bad for Paul. Paul's first punishment for angering her is a two day stretch without painkillers, water or food. When she thinks he lied to her, she amputates his foot. When he complains about the typewriter she makes him use, he loses a thumb. When he gets the attention of a possible rescuer, she runs over the policeman with a lawnmower.<br />However, Annie is now fighting a lost battle, the police begin to investigate, and Paul plans his revenge. His revenge is sweet, and his rescue secured, but he will always remain her prisoner. A chilling novel that I highly recommend.	2002-08-25

King brings young Roland to life, shows his arrogance, pride, and remorse. This novel reveals Roland to us while still plodding closer to the Dark Tower. If you have read the first three books, you will be amazed at the change of pace and plot.<br />What happens. The riddling contest with Blaine continues. Once Eddie finishes the riddling contest, they arrive in a parrallel Kansas, not their own, but a Kansas stricken with disease.  As they continue through this hybrid Kansas, Roland holds palaver to reveal parts of his youth to his Ka-tet.  It is the story of how his father protected him from Marten by sending Roland and two of his friends, Cuthbert and Alain, west to Mejis.  In Mejis, Roland falls in love with a beautiful girl named Susan.  He and his friends also discover a plot of Farson's about to run its course in Mejis.  Lied to and disliked by good, honest townsfolk, Roland must first discover the plot and then foil it.  But it becomes more than a quest to foil Farson, it becomes a quest to save his life, and the life of his friends.  Then we return to Kansas.  We have reached the Tower of Oz and reunite with old friends.  One is killed, while Flagg escapes.  In the end, Roland has returned to the path of the beam.<br />I highly recommend this book, even if you have not read the first three.  The story of Roland, Cuthbert, Alain, Susan, and the Big Coffin Hunters is so rich it is worth reading by itself.	2002-08-23

Roland's mythical world continues to grow and become real.  King develops his characters, giving them more depth and reality.  What really seperates this work from other fantasy series that I have read, is the direct connections between our world and Rolands.  This series is no longer out of reach, there are people from our world there.  Additionally, King shows the pains and results of a world that has moved on.  My favorite parts of the novel concern Jake; both his coming to Roland's world and his chase in Lud.<br />What happens.  Susan begins the novel by shooting one of the twelve guardians.  Roland then finds the path of the beam and follows it two Lud.  Before they reach it, Jake and Roland begin going insane.  Since Mort died before he pushed Jake, Jake was never killed, and never went to Roland's world, but he did.  Jake is brought into Roland's world and the problem is gone.  Jake is kidnapped on the bridge leading to Lud, Roland finds him.  Susan and Eddie find Blaine.  Blaine is train they must travel on past the wastelands, but he is a suicidal train.  The book ends with the a contest for their lives.  A riddling contest.<br />King's novels are fast paced and do not waste time on pointless details.	2002-08-08

I can see Roland waking on the beach near the endless ocean, I can see Roland trudging up the beach, weakening with each step, and I can see Eddie being drug by Detta below the merciless high tide line.  What makes the Dark Tower Series so unlike King's other work?  Instead of writing about situations in our own world, King has created his own, with many parallels and even doorways to our own.  Roland is like a knight with guns, ever pursuing his quest.  Eddie and Odetta are people he brings to his world from our world: future gunslingers.<br />What happens.  Roland draws three people from our world to his own.  He is infected by a creature who bites off three of he fingers.  When he reaches the first door, he is about to die from the poisen.  He rescues Eddie and brings him to his world with enough medicine to fight the infection.  From the second door he draws Odetta/Detta.  The third door is the most interesting for the connections between Mort and Odetta are seen.  From this door he brings more medicine, bullets, and a future gunslinger.  An amazing novel, in which Stephen King's ability to intertwine details is showcased.	2002-08-08

Secondly, if you don't like Stephen King's other works and you enjoy reading fantasy, you will like this book.  This book is unlike any horror novel written by King.  If you have read the Eyes of the Dragon, this book is similar to that.<br />I read this book for the first time three years ago.  Since then I have read the entire series and read this book two more times.  It seems like King is telling two stories.  One is of Roland's past life and the other is the situation he is faced with.  I find Roland's past as interesting as the current plot.  For fantasy lovers, I might compare Roland to Aragorn from Tolkien's work.  One of the last great men of a great people.  Willing to die for his cause and for honor.  He is the best at what he does, he does not feel pain, he cannot quit.  His task is to find the Dark Tower.  Where he will find it and what it holds he does not know.<br />What happens.  The gunslinger is following the Man in Black.  He tells us the story of a town he destroyed because of the Man in Black.  We meet Jake, a boy sent from our world to Roland's by the Man in Black.  We follow Jake and Roland across a vast desert as he trails the Man in Black.  Nothing can keep Roland from the Man in Black, and in the end Roland talks with the Man in Black.<br />I like this novel, I like this series.  I highly recommend it.	2002-08-01

Although I do not feel this book was as good as Heart of Darkness, Conrad wrote an amazing finish.  I felt myself thinking what might have happened, who the bomber may have been.  Then when Conrad revealed my thoughts were correct, I felt shaken.  Stevie's character had my pity and sympathy, and his end left me saddened.  I felt Mrs. Verloc's only recourse would be to kill her husband, yet I was still surprised at her actions.  I was almost surprised at how much she picked up from Mr. Verloc when she was in such a derranged state.  But what Conrad does best in this novel is portray human emotions.  He accurately described how many humans think, and how they react to traumatic situations.  The last seventy pages of the novel more than make The Secret Agent worth reading.	2002-07-24

I would like to say this is the best novel I have read, but how can I compare Dostoyevsky to Hemmingway to Tolstoy.  They all have different styles, and are excellent authors.  This is the best book I have read by Dostoyevsky.  Reading his novel, I feel, is better than reading history of 19th century Russia, and he does not intend to give a history lesson, the culture reveals itself in his novel.<br />Although I can not say this is the best book I have ever read, it has two conversations which are the best literature I have seen.  Each time Rashkolnikov visits Porfiry, the novel becomes incredibly dramatic.  This is the first time I have felt what a character in a novel (or movie) is feeling.  I feel his nervousness being questioned.  I felt arrogant that I could outsmart the cop.  I became anxious over my possible punishment.  I kept thinking, if I do not get found out this time, I will never do anything wrong again.  Crime is to nerve racking.<br />My final comment is on Russia itself.  I was surprised at how  some of the 19th century contempory ideas have correspondants in our culture.  Crime and Punishment is a great novel, I recommend it to all who enjoy literature.	2002-07-11

First, I will say this.  Winters Heart does not contain the same passion and fervor I found in the first book.  I have now read the series twice.  Each time, after reading the first book, I cannot get enough.  I finish the first three books feeling Jordan has composed a masterfull series.  Looking back at the past six novels, I think Jordan has slowed the pace of his novels and changed his characters personalities so that the series has lost some of its original flair.  If you have read the Path of Daggers, then I encourage you to read Winters Heart, which is a much better novel.  Winters Heart reminds me of the Brothers Karamazov.  An interesting beginning, a great finish, and a necessary but boring middle.  How Elayne secures the throne of Andor does not play a huge role in this Last Battle plot.  Of the major plots Jordan weaves, this one seemed boring in Winters Heart.  I enjoyed reading about the developments concerning Perrin, Mat and Rand, but Elayne bored me and Egwene was hardly mentioned.<br />The way Jordan develops multiple plots allows for multiple climaxs throughout the novel.  In Winter's Heart Jordan takes full advantage of his style.  He leaves you hanging with Perrin's, Mat's, and Elayne's situations, and I admit, the final pages concerning Elayne sparked my interest.  The parts of the novel concerning Rand were very intense and suspenseful.  If you are reading the reviews for this book, you have probably read the previous eight books.  In that case, buy this book, read it, and you will enjoy yourself.	2002-07-03

If you have read the first seven, then I recommend reading the eighth.  It does not bring an end to any scenarios, but it provides excellent continuation.  Jordan was masterful in describing the battle situations with the Seanchan.  I did notice that this book did not have its own climax, at least not one to speak of.  Continuation.  I believe, by what I have read, that book nine is going to be killer.  Book Eight leaves six plots near finalization.<br />What Happens.  Rand has become King of Illian, and he protects his country from the Seanchan, and Lews Therin suffers his first defeat.  Elayne and Nyn arrive in Caemlyn, having used the Bowl of the Winds.  Egwene secures her position as leader of the rebel Aes Sedai.  Mat is not mentioned.  Perrin reaches the Prophet and convinces him to visit Rand.  Faile is captured by the Shaido.<br />Overall, I thought it was a good book, but I was disappointed by the abscence of Mat.  Jordan developed his characters far enough, that the reader knows what to expect out of them.  I looking forward to how the wheel weaves in the next few novels.	2002-06-20

In the previous books, the climax was always  better than the rest of the book and the rest of the book was pretty darn good.  I will say the building action in the Crown of Swords is first rate, but the climax is lacking.  I am definitely glad I read the first part of this book, but I could have skipped the last 100 pages.  I kept waiting for something new and exciting to happen, and nothing did.  Even the conclusion leaves you hanging, not in a good way.  Jordan was written nine books, and he can't even be definitive on Sammael's fate.  He brings back other forsaken whenever he wants, but he won't even tell us if Sammael even died.  I have two problems with this novel.  One is the conclusion I have already mentioned.  The second is Rand's love life.  I don't care who he loves or how often he makes love. Many men have loved more than one woman, but I don't think it qualifies as adventure.  However, the rest of the novel is much better and makes the Crown of Swords worth reading.<br />What Happens?  Mat, Elayne, and Nyn find the bowl in Ebou Dar, but do nothing with it yet.  Mat becomes a pretty for the queen of Ebou Dar.  Rand is captured by Aes Sedai and severly mistreated.  He is rescued by Perrin and makes some of the Aes Sedai swear fealty to him.  Perrin continues to have troubles with Faile and Berelain.  The Ashaman have increased in numbers and power.  Elaida has lost all power to her Keeper.  Egwene is on the march for Tar Valon, and is receiving massages from one of the resurrected Forsaken.<br />Mat Cauthon makes this novel.  I think the plot of this novel is centered around developing Mat's character, eliminating Sammael, and creating aminosity between Rand and Elaida, perhaps between all Rand and all Aes Sedai.  A third of the novel deals with Mat and his views and characteristics.  Lews Therin's voice makes this novel even better.  The voice is usually funny and ironic, I look forward to pages with italicized sentences.  As long as Jordan includes them, I will enjoy the Wheel of Time Series.  I have critized this novel, but it was also my second time reading it, which is why I gave it four stars.funny and ironic, I look forward to pages with italicized sentences.

However, in order to enjoy or understand The Lord of Chaos, one must first read the previous five books.  This book finally begins to reveal where Jordan is going with the series.  He has been developing a plot for action for much of the last three books, and at the end of The Lord of Chaos the action is released.  I am sure the following books will develop largely from what occurs in this novel, making it a cornerstone to the series.<br />Much changes in this novel.  Perrin is reintroduced to the plot and joins Rand in Caemlyn and follows to Cairhien.  Perhaps the most interesting events concern Mat.  Jordan reveals that the Daughter of the Nine Moons is Seanchan.  Mat also leads Rand's army of Dragonsworn.  Elayne and Nyn use Moghedien to discover new uses of the power and leave for Ebou Dar to find a weather ter'angreal.  Egwene leaves the Wise Ones to go to Salidar.  The men Rand gathers to channel become a force to be reckoned with.  Min reaches Rand and enjoys teasing him.  I would reveal more about Rand, but that would spoil the novel.<br />For me, Mat and Lews Therin are the most interesting characters. The fact that The Lord of Chaos spends so much time dealing with them makes this book one of my favorites.  I did not notice as much reptition in this novel as in previous.  I think Jordan realizes that someone who is reading the Lord of Chaos has probably read the entire series.  If you thought the Fires of Heaven was so-so and are deciding whether to read the next one, I recommend at least reading The Lord of Chaos before quitting the Series.	2002-05-12

This was a short story, about 80 pages.  It was almost a completely new writing style.  Gone were his repetitive descriptions and explanations.  For this story, Jordan assumes the Reader has read the series and creates a much more fast paced and interesting plot.  It is also a change to able to finish one of his stories in one day.  All of the information remains fresh, I never struggled to remember why something was happening.  Additionally the plot was well constructed.  Reading about Moraine and Lan while they were younger was quite interesting.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Robert Jordan's writing.	2002-05-11

First, I admit that I am favorably biased toward any fantasy book. But if you also enjoy these types of novels, Jordan does not disappoint. I have read many authors who go into great detail and are able to weave deep plots. But as I read the last one hundred pages of the Fires of Heaven, I was amazed. I had forgotten how good this book was. The ending to the Fires of Heaven was better than any of the four previous Wheel of Time books, and I think better than the next four. The climax comes at you in two waves. The first wave is good enough to be the finish for the book, but Jordan continues, and left me ready to begin the next book.<br />So what happens. Siuan, Leane, Min, and Logain are be hunted by Bryne for Oathbreaking. They do eventually make it to Salidar, where Aes Sedai opposing Elaida are gathering. But Bryne finds them there, and is chosen to lead rebel Aes Sedai's forces against Elaida. Nyn and Elayne have left Tanchico with Thom and Julian. Eventually they join a carnival, until they get passage to Salidar. Birgitte also becomes part of the real world. Once they make it to Salidar, Nyn captures Moghedien. Rand chases Couladin to Cairhien, where Rand defeats him. Mat becomes a talented military leader, and becomes one of Rand's generals-unwillingly. Moiraine dies killing Lanfear. Rand and Avienhda become lovers. <br />This book continues to develop Mat's character more in depth. Additionally, much of Nyn's personality and thought process is described. With everything that occurs in this book, what makes Fires of Heaven one of my favorite Wheel of Time books is that Faile is never mentioned. Jordan created many good characters, but Faile makes me skip passages. Perrin went from being one of my favorite characters, to being a warning for Faile. This is a great book, but it has created a problem. I cannot decide if it was better the first or second time I read it.	2002-04-25

Yes, this book has much action, but there is more explaning and revelation of the plot.  Where in previous three novels, there was a goal to be acheived, (i.e.  Finding the Eye of the World, Finding the Horn, Getting Callandor) this novel acheives nothing specific.  It provides a link to whatever follows in the following novels.  If I were to compare this series to Tolkien's work, I would say the each of the first three books would be similar to the Hobbit, while the Shadow Rising is similar to The Two Towers, lots of action without much changing.<br />  What does happen.  Rand leaves Tear with Mat, Egwene, Moraine, and the Aiel to go to the waste.  Nyn, Elayne, Julian, and Thom go to Tanchico to hunt the Black Ajah.  Perrin, Loial, and Faile go to the Two Rivers to fight Trollocs and Whitecloaks.  In Tanchico, the Black Ajah escapes, and Nyn fights one of the forsaken.  In the waste, Rand becomes He Who Comes With the Dawn, and finds a teacher in one of the Forsaken.  Egwene learns more about dreamwalking.  Mat almost dies, but has his memory filled with other soldier's memories.  Perring defeats incredible odds, marries Faile, and rescues the Two Rivers. <BR> <BR>  I like this novel because of the development of Mat and Rand who are my favorite characters.  I have just finished reading it for the second time and highly recommend reading the series.  While someone could start the series from the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd book, too much has occurred to start with the 4th book.	2002-03-25

The Hobbit relates the reader to the character.  The story is also adventurous and exciting.  I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time.  A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards.  The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time.  After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more.  It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding.	2002-03-07

I have read the entire series and am beginning it again.  What Jordan does is develop a huge plot on many different levels.  In the first novel, all the characters converge toward the same finish.  But as the series progresses, characters parts in the book become more independent of one another.  Therefore, for Jordan to go into the same detail he utilizes in the first novel, many of the later novels slow down.  The series on a whole is very good, but he develop's so many individual stories, that the pace of the books slow down.  I would not mind this, except it takes three years for him to write a book.  However, I am looking forward to the end of the three years.	2002-03-07

If you have not read the first book you will probably be lost, but it will still be a good read because the plot has not developed far by the end of the first book.  This book is better than the first because the plot is developing.  There is more action and we learn more about the characters lives.  Jordan continues to create bonds between characters and readers.  I have read this book twice, and each time I have been unable to stop thinking about.  Once I finished it, I had to start the Dragon Reborn the same day.  If you are thinking about buying this book, my recomendation is to buy The Great Hunt and The Dragon Reborn.	2002-03-07
