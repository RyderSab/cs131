Clark Publishers, Ltd.) (Hardcover) is an interdisciplinary theological text that engages a variety of postmodern discourses in a dialogue across time and place. In rereading ancient Christian texts along with poststructuralist, feminist, and postcolonial works, I employ these critical theories not as a trendy plot to discredit tradition but as a valuable tool for the critical investigation of material that rarely has been critically engaged. As we will see, rereading Christian texts in this manner reveals the potential of imagining a trickster-like \\"God the economist\\": a gambler and a courageous, hopeful investor in unpredictabilities, involved in subversive divine economic deals. Thus, divine economy emerges as less predictable, as it renegotiates \\"the domi¬nant oikonomia-the economics, the ecology, the ecumenism of order.\\" It deconstructs simplistic characterizations of God as \\"capitalist\\" or \\"commu¬nist\\" and instead delights in uncovering multiplicities of economic rela¬tionality that resist tyranny, stasis, and oppression by envisioning strategies of flexible, miraculous exchanges. Aware that \\"theology has not outgrown the subjection of the oikos to the dominus,\\" it points toward the redemp¬tion and release of those women and slaves expropriated by the domination of the profit-driven deified economies of late, or extreme, capitalism.<br /><br />Chapter 1 positions the \\"third space\\" Grau attempts to construct by charting a variety of discursive spaces where theology and economy have intersected since the 1960s. By gaining a greater understanding of how people are invested in the economic structures they find objectionable, we must begin to understand that the line between economic justice and exploitation is not comfortably located outside ourselves but goes right through our own investments, theological, relational, and financial. The chapter further traces the outlines of a countereconomic theology that is less involved in a critique of contemporary economics than in a genealogy of the interactions between theological and material economies, ancient and postmodern.<br /><br />At the core of the proposed reconstructive figuration in a contemporary feminist and postcolonial third space, chapters 2 through 4 each portray a figure that forms part of ancient and contemporary rhetorical and actual economies. Each of these figures represents an iteration of an ancient image of redemptive divine economy. They are feminist figures in the sense that, as Haraway suggests, \\"feminist figures of humanity . . . cannot be man or woman; they cannot be the human as historical narrative has staged that generic universal. Feminist figures cannot, finally, have a name; they cannot be native. Feminist humanity must, somehow, both resist representation, resist literal figuration, and still erupt in powerful new tropes, new figures of speech, new turns of historical possibility.\\"<br /><br />Attempting thus to \\"resist representation\\" while exploring \\"new tropes, new figures\\" from among our histories, these central chapters, which are structured as a discursive triptych, explore three textually embodied figures that not only blur the boundaries between man and woman, master and slave, but also question the binary opposition of lack and abundance, cap¬italism and Marxism, divine and earthly economies. Resisting the ten¬dency of \\"feminist theology ... to leave biblical interpretation to feminist exegetical and historical scholars,\\" the approach to an interdisciplinary constructive theology in these chapters consciously engages the texts of the tradition as well as the texts of biblical and historical scholars. Thus, the three figural genealogies are situated in contemporary theological and his¬torical discussions as the descendants of Christian typologies of salvation history. These soteriological genealogies can help us to inhabit a third space beyond theological and economicdichotomies only if we hold these figures lightly. They do not mean to represent persons but rather function as tex¬tual incarnations, as hermeneutical products of textual economies that have shaped our theological past and present.<br /><br />These three genealogies trace the literary lives of members in an ancient household: kurios (master), kuria (mistress), and doulos (slave), and their descendants who resemble us uncannily (unheimlich). Uncannily, in a sense that points to the ambiguity of our being at home with (heimisch) as well as unheimlich-estranged and spooked by the spectre of the hierar¬chies of gender and class written into the divine economy. The power-knowledge constructions of the human household have contributed to images of divine oikonomia that reaffirmed the patriarchal shape of the oikos at the same time as they called into question the conventions of class and gender among humans. The first figure resembles the rich young man (Matt 19:16-30) in his wealth and corresponding lack of spiritual abun¬dance; the second figure emerges from images of female givers such as the poor widow (Mk 12:43-44), whose lack of material wealth nevertheless counts as abundance with God; the third figure is the slave-liberator found in the christological topos of divine commerce, a sacred trickster mediating between d&#943;v&#943;ne abundance and human destitution.<br /><br />All of these figures share some of the characteristics of the trickster fig¬ures Haraway evokes and are formed by modes of textual production akin to what Bhabha has described as hybridity, the \\"problematic of colonial representation and individuation that reverses the effects of the colonialist disavowal, so that other `denied' knowledges enter upon the dominant discourse and estrange the basis of its authority-its rules of recognftion.\\" Thus, these figures are not untroubled and contain great hermeneutical and incarnational complexity. Chapter 5 further elucidates the trickster qualities that emerge in the central chapters, and rethinks the way they trouble the categories of gender and class. Then it begins to portray con-temporary trickster figures as they embody miraculous exchanges.<br /><br />Ambivalence remains a constant companion, an inspiration and challenge for this exploration. The figural reading proposed in these pages aims to deconstruct the proliferation of polarities as expressed in stereotypes of economic and theological genders, classes, and races and in the locations of various other forms of colonial and postcolonial embodiment. With Gayatri Spivak, they refuse to \\"continue to celebrate\\" essentializing moralisms such as those of colonizer/colonized and white/black in which \\"the migrant is all good\\" and \\"the whites are all bad.\\" Instead, they embody a theologi¬cal response that gives witness to the complexities and complicities of the relations between oppressor and oppressed. They also resist the salvific proclamation of a \\"mighty mongrel\\" whose hybrid, mestizo characteristics are elevated as a new su&#961;erbreed of human that can solve the problems of the past by embodying a variety of pasts and traditions. Such romantic displacements spawn new dangers if hybridity develops into another form of orthodoxy, reinscribing rather than challenging the divisions of the past.<br /><br />The first tw&#959; figures show symptoms of hysteria, a notoriously puzzling condition in which the hysteric's body discloses through linguistic and phys¬ical symptoms a larger condition transferred onto the sufferer by his or her societal context. Chapters 1 and 3 thus offer a hermeneutic with which to read this trickster among diseases, this \\"mimetic disorder,\\" as it performs \\"culturally permissible expressions of distress\\" in men and discloses unforeseen subversive potencies in women. Hysteria emerges as a disorder that closely maps the gendered economic conditions of lack and plenitude as they are assigned and reassigned in the Christian oikonomiaof redemption. Although ancient rhetorical economies have endowed male bodies with an abundance of administrative and reproductive power while linking the reproductive cavities of female bodies with the appearance of both physical and mental lack, men too can be marked by hysteria, deficiency, or lack.<br /><br />In chapter 2, we see how almsgiving and asceticism are theologically negotiated as male investments in an economy of salvation that informs the interpretation of the exemplary narrative of the rich young man in Matthew 19. Ascesis and almsgiving emerge as tw&#959; modes of divine and earthly resource management for the wealthy males who interpreted Matthew's text. In Matthew 19, wealth becomes poverty, while ascesis and almsgiving, although they represent renunciation, eventually pay off as a smart investment in the heavenly economy. Thus, like the seemingly unisex but rather effectively masculine homo economicus of the British enlightenment, these readers operate and make economic decisions on the basis of a notion related to hysteria and lack while continually striving for abundance.<br /><br />H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous and Luce Irigaray have shown that in the gendered economies of phallocentric cultures, women are traded as inferior, marked as a hollow \\"lack,\\" but also signify the place where future abundance and the growth of male descendants (and hence, wealth) occurs. Women's ambivalent position between lack and abundance is similarly reflected in the rhetorical and material economies of gender and salvation in biblical and patristic texts. Chapter 3 traces the figure of the \\"giving woman\\" through several such texts. In them, we find the continued reinscription of women as the economically impoverished gender via the stereotypical ascription of lack to the bodies of women. In the overall economy of most early Christian texts, women are rarely \\"of substance.\\" And even if women appear as significant figures, their images are disciplined and managed through various rhetorical topoi and societal constructs. At the same time, we find figures such as the poor widow presented as the epitome of a wealth of grace in Jesus' bas&iacute;leia (\\"reign\\" or \\"kingdom\\"). At times women emerge endowed with unexpected subversive powers within the constraints of the economies of gender and church structures.<br /><br />The figure of the \\"slave\\" and the \\"trickster\\" involves another set of rhetorical economies that have disciplined human and divine economies: the redemptive exchange of a price to redeem-to buy back-the body of a slave. Chapter 4 then reconstructs divine commerce using the soteriological motif of ransom from slavery. Ransom thus becomes the admirabile com¬mercium, the divine commerce and miraculous exchange between God, humanity, and the devil. A critical reconstruction of this motif brings the soteriological motif of the commercium into the twenty-first century, mim¬icking the dynamics of ancient slave management even as it changes and modifies them. The ambivalence of the \\"wonderful exchange\\" allows for a reconstruction of the topos as the redemptive trickery of a God who, while preserving wisdom and justice, is not above \\"deceiving the devil\\" for the redemption of creation. The image of divine commerce thus offers a sacred trickster's scheme as one incarnation of divine countereconomy.<br /><br />The figures represent textual incarnations of early Christian notions of redemption and salvation as their salvific and material economies(almsgiving, asceticism, gender and class dynamics) become the site where constructions of human and divine economy stand in a close but tenuous relationship to each other. From these genealogies, chapter 5 develops cre¬ative possibilities for contemporary theological and economic subjects, for inhabiting various locations in a subversive, prophetic divine economy that imagines exchanges of coredemption, of \\"consensual salvation\\" in an ongo¬ing process of mutually transformed relations.<br /><br />All three trickster figures live in the borderlands of heaven and earth, wealth and poverty, sincerity and deception. They embody forms of theo¬logical, sexual, and social hybridity. As genealogies of our contemporary theological and economic context, they help us to inhabit that elusive third space between theological and economic dichotomies. In chapter 5, Grau imag¬ines what the contemporary incarnations of these sacred tricksters might look like. Holy Fool, Saint Mysteria, and the Counterfeit(ing) Christ are introduced as possible descendants of the figures whose genealogies are represented in chapters 2 through 4. These trickster figures, their similarities and differences, unfold as midrash-like pieces, bridging the stretches of the millennia of salvation history. As revelatory figures, tricksters unveil the monetary, relational, and physical exchanges that become theological expressions of divine economy. Chapter 5 offers a discussion of the possi¬bilities of a tricksterish economics in a world where con men appear to win the day. The sacred trickster's redemptive trickery, in contrast, is inspired by Christ's divine commerce and the tricksterlike \\"economist\\" of Luke 16, an ambivalent figure that yet inspires divinely clever trades. A post-Weberian reassessment of ascetic practices suggests that birth control and simplified living on an overpopulated planet is a form of cultural protest, and another possible strategy. A reconstruction of the time-honored motif of the Holy Fool is followed by a call to recognize gender differences among male and female trickster figures and tactics and further to assess the gendered diver¬sity of tricksterisms. Gendering the trickster is crucial if the concept is to be inclusive of women's particular strategies. Beyond the recognition of gender difference, it will be necessary to more deeply que(e)ry divine commerce. The voluntarily enslaved male Christ of tradition is recast (with a little help from Jean-François Lyotard) as Jesus, the calculating female pros¬titute who barters salvation in return for his/her body. Such tricky trades<br /><br />do not promise purity of motive or predictable profit. Rather, they always take place in a matrix of ambivalent relations and resemble the complexity of the created universe, or divine economy, which periodically returns to the creative and unpredictable edge of chaos.<br /><br />In traditional constructions of redemption, not all models juxtapose the singular activity of God with the complete passivity of humanity. Rather, numerous apostolic and patristic texts central to the Christian tradition's notion of divine salvific activity retain the coredemptive character of divine salvific agency resident in many biblical texts. Eastern theologies likewise have preserved the notion of theosis as the human participation in salvation, and a sizable number of feminist theologians emphasize the synergic character of salvific relations between God and humanity. Imagining redemption as a similarly cooperative process involves a soteriology of \\"modest witnesses\\" striving to heal and be healed, yet knowing they exist in the fragile space of Paul's old predicament-the turmoil within the redeemed, the ambivalence at the intersection of the \\"already\\" and the \\"not yet:' This modest soteriology resonates with \\"&#961;&#959;ly¬glossic\\" relations and does not easily figure as purely divine or merely human.<br /><br />In the process of reconstructing redemption, we are working in danger¬ous and murky zones, as Moltmann reminds us: \\"For where this way of perceiving history is concerned, H&ouml;lderlin's saying is true: `Where there is danger, the salutary also grows'-as is also its reverse: where the salutary grows, there danger also grows (E. Bloch)\\" Combining H&ouml;lderlin's more optimistic statement with Bloch's more sober observation, Moltmann reaf¬firms that the kairos of a moment in space remains open for many possibil¬ities and includes potential for both dangerous and redemptive moments. In this respect, at least, the theology to be reconstructed here might repre¬sent an instance of theologia viatorum (theology on the way) suggested by Moltmann, a practice that l&#959;&#959;ks at Scripture not as a \\"closed organism\\" but as a text open toward future instances of divine economy unfurling in each moment of space-time.e, we find figures such as the poor widow presented as the epitome of a wealth of grace in Jesus' basleia (\\"reign\\" or \\"kingdom\\").

This volume contains selected papers pre¬sented at the international conference on Vladimir Solov'ëv held at Nijmegen University, The Netherlands, in September 1998. The scope of this conference was wide-ranging, dealing with theological, metaphysical, philosophical and historical themes.<br /><br />Though S&#959;&#921;&#959;&#957;'ëv's broad intellectual activity defies any strict attempt at categorisation, the editors have classified its major themes under the dual characteristic of reconciliation and polemics. Solov'ëv was pas¬sionately committed to the reconciliation of all beings under the idea of all-unity, which he attempted to achieve by engaging in uncompromis¬ing polemics with his contemporaries.<br /><br />The thirty contributors to this volume are specialists from Russia, ,Ukraine, Bulgaria, Western Europe and the United States.

Francophone Women Film Directors: A Guide by Janis L. Pallister, Ruth A. Hottell (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press) When French-Speaking Women Film Directors was published in 1997, two things became evident: (1) It was an essential tool for students, instructors, and scholars of francophone women filmmakers, serving a vital purpose for all levels&iexcl;ªfrom the novice looking for guidance to the seasoned scholar checking a fact, date, or other specific detail. (2) It would be necessary to continue immediately the important task of cataloging women's cinema; for although they still meet with obstacles even in Occidental cultures, their artistic productions have increased exponentially in recent years. Similarly, technological advances (particularly in the various video formats) now make even somewhat minor productions significantly more available to the general public at affordable prices. Hence, more films and great accessibility demanded furthering the research.<br /><br />In this volume, Ruth A. Hottell has joined Janis L. Pallister in filling the gaps of the 1997 volume, and following the progress made by women since its publication. Like its predecessor, Francophone Women Film Directors is both a teaching tool and a directory for use by scholars and students of film and literature. Unique among guides dealing with film, both for its breadth and for the very fact that it is devoted exclusively to francophone womenthroughout the world, most of whom are omitted from other directories and studies, this guide contains listings of nearly three hundred francophone women filmmakers and their films. Whenever possible, dates, brief biographies, descriptions, and short critical analyses by Professors Pallister and Hottell, as well as by others, are included. These two authors have painstakingly researched film journals and the Internet, attended film festivals and conferences around the world, monitored TV listings in various countries, and traveled around the world to work in film libraries and view recent releases. Their efforts have produced the most comprehensive guide available today.<br /><br />The reader will see that the filmmakers included in the book are from all parts of the world: France, Belgium, Switzerland, Latin America, Quebec, even Thailand. Users of this guide will be able to set up a truly global program on the subject. Moreover, this book, like its predecessor, offers a section called \\"core concepts,\\" designed to enable instructors to organize a course or a program around a theme of interest to feminists, drawing from world cinema by both women and men directors. These core concepts and themes include such subjects as abortion, pornography, prostitution, and mother-daughter relationships. A list of film sources, an extensive bibliography, and an index of film directors and the titles of their films, as well as geographical subdivisions, maximize the directory's usefulness.<br /><br />Within this framework, why concentrate especially on French-speaking women directors? Firstly, as a service to (French) teachers and professors who now incorporate film&iexcl;ªand women's art&iexcl;ªinto many of their courses. Next, because in spite of the problems etched above, one cannot deny that a number of the women filmmakers of France, Qu¨¦bec and Belgium have become virtually as well known as many male directors: Chantal Akerman is quite famous; her film Couch in New York has frequently aired on television; L¨¦a Pool, too, is known in many circles, and can be considered as almost on a level with Atom Egoyam. But especially famous are Claire Denis, Catherine Breillat, and Agn¨¨s Varda, the latter's recent film, Les Gl¦&Aacute;neurs et la glaneuse (The Gleaners and I), having received widespread recognition, and having been, for example, the fifth of the top ten sales made by Facets in the spring of 2002, while Breillat's Une vraie jeune fille (A Real Young Girl) came in sixth. This is from all sexes and countries. Virginie Despentes's sensational and controversial Baise-moi was ninth in the top ten rentals (from all countries) and figured as ninth of twenty-five top-selling foreign films.<br /><br />This compact volume seeks, then, to answer questions not only about the works of renowned artists, including the remarkable success of such works as Breillat's and Despentes's, but about those of lesser-known artists as well. Striving to complete the picture through 2002, it is compiled from many sources, and presents information in English, but with reference to French copy, in order to increase the guide's versatility.<br /><br />The authors have found the presentations and catalogs of the Cr¨¦teil Festival of Women's Films to be of particular value. On the web, there are sites devoted to women's films and women in films, many of which are cited in our bibliography. Catalogs and Web sites of the NFB (ONF) are also a rich source of information, and we are especially grateful to this entity for its kind permission to borrow generously from its copy.<br /><br />They have excerpted material from all of these references and from others besides&iexcl;ªwhether in English or in French&iexcl;ª, for the convenience of those who wish to use this guide book. Wherever this has been done, the source of the information has been given. It should be noted that dates and run times vary considerably from one source to the other; in most cases we have made no effort to adjudicate these matters, but have given sliding dates and dur¨¦es. These variations in date occur for a number of reasons among which one might suggest that: 1) the film was planned for one year, but in fact, was held up for some reason or another; 2) sometimes a new copyright date has been put on the USA version, both on the film and on the video; 3) some-times, even, a new date was put on the video when it came out. For similar reasons the running time can vary from film to video, etc.<br /><br />Many Shorts of a few minutes are to be found in Cr¨¦teil catalogs. The information regarding them has been only partially reproduced here. Similarly, virtually all documentaries have been excluded here; they and their directors will be treated in a separate guide to French-speaking women documentarian.<br /><br />One more note is in order here.

It should be noted that dates and run times vary considerably from one source to the other; in most cases we have made no effort to adjudicate these matters, but have given sliding dates and dur¨¦es. These variations in date occur for a number of reasons among which one might suggest that: 1) the film was planned for one year, but in fact, was held up for some reason or another; 2) sometimes a new copyright date has been put on the USA version, both on the film and on the video; 3) some-times, even, a new date was put on the video when it came out. For similar reasons the running time can vary from film to video, etc. <br />Many Shorts of a few minutes are to be found in Cr¨¦teil catalogs.

Holt (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications: Chapman & Hall/CRC) is about computational group theory, which we shall frequently abbreviate to CGT. The origins of this lively and active branch of mathematics can he traced back to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but it has been flourishing particularly during the past 30 to 40 years. The aim of this book is to provide as complete a treatment as possible of all of the fundamental methods and algorithms in CGT, without straying above a level suitable for a beginning postgraduate student.<br /><br />The most basic algorithms in CGT tend to be representation specific; that is, there are separate methods for groups given as permutation or matrix groups, groups defined by means of polycyclic presentations, and groups that are defined using a general finite presentation. The author has devoted separate chapters to algorithms that apply to groups in these different types of repre¬sentations, but there are other chapters that cover important methods involving more than one type. For example, Chapter 6 is about finding presentations of permutation groups and the connections between coset enumeration and methods for finding the order of a finite permutation group.<br /><br />There is also included a chapter (Chapter 11) on the increasing number of precomputed stored libraries and databases of groups, character tables, etc. that are now publicly available. They have been playing a major rôle in CGT in recent years, both as an invaluable resource for the general mathematical public, and as components for use in some advanced algorithms in CGT. The library of all finite groups of order up to 2000 (except for order 1024) has proved to be particularly popular with the wider community.<br /><br />It is inevitable that our choice of topics and treatment of the individual topics will reflect the authors' personal expertise and preferences to some extent. On the positive side, the final two chapters of the book cover appli¬cations of string-rewriting techniques to CGT (which is, however, treated in much greater detail, and the application of finite state automata to the computation of automatic structures of finitely presented groups. On the other hand, there may be some topics for which our treatment is more superficial than it would ideally be.<br /><br />One such area is the complexity analysis of the algorithms of CGT. During the 1980s and 1990s some, for the most part friendly and respectful, rivalry developed between those whose research in CGT was principally directed to-wards producing better performance of their code, and those who were more interested in proving theoretical results concerning the complexity of the al¬gorithms. This study of complexity began with the work of Eugene Luks, who established a connection in his 1982 article between permutation group algorithms and the problem of testing two finite graphs for isomorphism. Our emphasis in this book will be more geared towards algorithms that per-form well in practice, rather than those with the best theoretical complexity. Fortunately, Seress' book includes a very thorough treatment of com¬plexity issues, and so we can safely refer the interested reader there. In any case, as machines become faster, computer memories larger, and bigger and bigger groups come within the range of practical computation, it is becom¬ing more and more the case that those algorithms with the more favourable complexity will also run faster when implemented.<br /><br />The important topic of computational group representation theory and computations with group characters is perhaps not treated as thoroughly as it might be in this book. Some of the basic material is covered in Chapter 7, but there is unfortunately no specialized book on this topic.<br /><br />One of the most active areas of research in CGT at the present time, both from the viewpoint of complexity and of practicalperformance, is the development of effective methods for computing with large finite groups of matrices. Much of this material is beyond the scope of this book. It is, in any case, developing and changing too rapidly to make it sensible to attempt to cover it properly here. Some pointers to the literature will of course be provided, mainly in Section 7.8.<br /><br />Yet another topic that is beyond the scope of this book, but which is of increasing importance in CGT, is computational Lie theory. This includes computations with Coxeter groups, reflection groups, and groups of Lie type and their representations. It also connects with computations in Lie algebras, which is an area of independent importance. The article by Cohen, Murray, and Taylor provides a possible starting point for the interested reader.<br /><br />The author firmly believes that the correct way to present a mathematical algorithm is by means of pseudocode, since a textual description will generally lack precision, and will usually involve rather vague instructions like \\"carry on in a similar manner\\". So we have included pseudocode for all of the most basic algorithms, and it is only for the more advanced procedures that we have occasionally lapsed into sketchy summaries. We are very grateful to Thomas Cormen who has made his LATEX package `clrscode' for displaying algorithms publicly available. This was used by him and his coauthors in the well-known textbook on algorithms.<br /><br />Although working through all but the most trivial examples with procedures that are intended to be run on a computer can be very tedious, the author attempted to include illustrative examples for as many algorithms as is practical.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter, or sometimes section, the reader's attention directed to some applications of the techniques developed in that chapter either to other areas of mathematics or to other sciences. It is generally difficult to do this effectively. Although there are many important and interesting applications of CGT around, the most significant of them will typically use methods of CGT as only one of many components, and so it not possible to do them full justice without venturing a long way outside of the main topic of the book.<br /><br />The author assumes that the reader is familiar with group theory up to an advanced undergraduate level, and has a basic knowledge of other topics in algebra, such as ring and field theory. Chapter 2 includes a more or less complete survey of the required background material in group theory, but we shall assume that at least most of the topics reviewed will be already familiar to readers. Chapter 7 assumes some basic knowledge of group representation theory, such as the equivalence between matrix representations of a group G over a field K and KG-modules, but it is interesting to note that many of the most fundamental algorithms in the area, such as the `Meataxe', use only rather basic linear algebra.effective methods for computing with large finite groups of matrices.

Glick (Mellen Studies in Mythology, V. 1: Edwin Mellen Press) A first place to seek identification of characters and places from Greek and Roman Mythology. Glick has produced a monograph which, in time, will be found on the shelf of every serious classicist. In no greater length than a legal brief, he has systematically displayed the entire spectrum of gods and goddesses who made up the mythology of early western history.<br /><br />The word `ancient' must be used in a way at allude to that repository of story of the ancient world. So much of the primal tradition remains fully alive today in names and classical allusions. The legends and fables remain essential in the background tapestry of the western letters.<br /><br />Glick has positioned every entry, Greek and Roman alike, within its mythological heritage. Each is also sited in the more familiar terrain of its actual historical location, Athens or Rome. Whether person, place or thing, each element in the lïng roll call is still recognized, centuries later.

Yet, the immense classic is seldom seen in a private home. Just here, the Gl&eacute;ck edition can fill a vital role. Slim as a primer, and crisply written, its 140 pages contain all the insights into our Greek and Roman mythological heritage that any previous publication has offered.

Excerpt: For many years, the study of Greek mythology as a major aspect of Greek culture was haunted by the aura of a superlative society that almost stood alone among the other peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean and had practically invented every value related to human development. As a result of this view, our appreciation of Greek myths was doomed to remain limited and our understanding of their social function could not proceed further than the safe speculation that they must have played a significant role in ancient social structure either by reflecting it or by interpreting it.' In more recent days the rising of comparative studies which coincided with the discovery and examination of more Near Eastern texts has led to the appreciation of the similarities that Greek myths exhibit in comparison with Eastern mythic specimens.' The work of W. Burkert and his pupils, as well as the studies of G. Nagy, C. Penglase and others have given more completed answers regarding the central position of myth in Greek society and religion. Greek civilisation is now understood as a complex institution, which had to absorb many traditions from its interactions with other social and religious entities. In this vast cauldron of ideas about man and g¦Ïd, the Greeks had to decide on their own stance as members of the social and cultic group that the city-state represented, as citizens of a state that lived with the guilt of giving birth to ephemeral creatures and under the heavy responsibility of preparing them to accept their mortality. The anxiety of the ancient world was particularly associated with the necessity of birth (i.e. sexual activity) and death that absolutely defined the human condition and of course, with the nature of the gods who administered insufferable fortunes to mortals.<br /><br />Chapter One: The Myth of Atalanta<br /><br />The myth of Atalanta was initially treated by Hesiod but it often reappeared in poetry until the late Augustan period. The popularity of the myth in antiquity is additionally confirmed by its survival in<br /><br />the scripts of I. Tzetzes, a scholar of the twelfth century AD 42 The erotic element of the myth was underlined during the Hellenistic period although it was also implicit in the archaic versions. There were tw¦Ï main versions of the myth; an Arcadian that focused on the heroine's hunting skills and a Boeotian that referred to the foot race that she had set as a prerequisite for her marriage.<br /><br />Atalanta as a heroine particularly hostile to marriage is compared to Artemis. Consequently, it will be argued that the myth should be understood in the context of rites of passage from adolescence to adulthood. Details from later versions of the myth such as those of Apollodorus, Aelian, and Ovid are discussed in relation to the cultic processes in honour of Artemis at Brauron, Haloa and other locations. Atalanta is perceived as a by-form of the goddess who, as her mortal reflection confirms, exhibited many similarities with Near Eastern goddesses like Cybele and Ishtar. Although Artemis was regarded as a strictly virginal deity, her role as protector of the young of every species also gave her aspects of a fertility goddess.<br /><br />In this framework, the apples that appeared in the myth of Atalanta underline the association of the myth with fertility and therefore, with pre-nuptial customs. In addition, they stress the erotic character of the myth since the early days of its circulation; the question of whether later poets that treated the myth were aware of its erotic connotations is put forward. A study of the role of the apples in NearEastern rites and magical spells shows remarkable similarities between the Greek and the Near Eastern cultic practices. In b¦Ïth cultures, apples were associated with erotic filters and nuptial ceremonies thus indicating that in antiquity lovers were regarded as bewitched. The circumstances under which the Greeks were influenced by the Near East cultures are also covered.<br /><br />The myth of Atalanta was treated by Propertius in the programmatic elegy of his Monobiblos, a poem that has raised many debates regarding the nature of Latin erotic elegy and its origins. The allusions employed by Propertius seem to be explained more effectively through the recent reading of the myth in association with fertility rites. Propertius and the other elegists seem to have been familiar with a set of ideas initially promoted in the Near Eastthat extolled the magical aspect of love which could even cause madness and disease to its victims. Propertius' preference for the myth stresses the erotic implications of certain motifs within the myth such as the motif of running in the wild. Furthermore, the association of love and marriage with agriculture, a relation often imprinted in ancient metaphors is also pointed out.<br /><br />Chapter Two: The Myth of Daphnis (Theocr¨ªtus)<br /><br />In the previous chapter, the agricultural aspect of love was merely touched upon. This chapter explores in detail the views of Theocritus on love as rendered through the myth of Daphnis. The myth was favoured by Theocritus' ancient editor(s) as the most representative of his bucolic poetry and was therefore placed at the beginning of his collection. The status of Theocritus among the Hellenistic poets and the longstanding aphorism that bucolic poetry is at the fringe of Hellenistic literary production will be presented. It has nowadays been accepted that Theocritus did not invent the bucolic genre, although the question regarding the origins of the genre remains unanswered. The claims of the ancient sources, which refer to as yet unattested fertility rites, will be examined through the indications contained in the tradition of Daphnis.<br /><br />According to the traditional version of the myth, Daphnis, the Sicilian proto-shepherd cheated on his divine beloved and was blinded in return before falling off a rock into a river. The tragic death of the hero is also treated in the first Idyll. The argument that Theocritus followed another version, which allies Daphnis with the Euripidian Hippolytus, is here refuted. The association of Daphnis with cult is investigated and motifs already detected in the myth of Atalanta, like that of a girl wandering in the wilderness, are brought to discussion. It is held that Daphnis was in love and therefore, he could be viewed as a prototype of the Propertiun elegiac lover.<br /><br />In the first Idyll Theocritus offered certain clues about the mythic affiliation of Daphnis with heroes such as Adonis and Gilgamesh who had their origins in the Near Eastern cults of the consort of the fertility goddess. It is argued that Theocritus, who in Idyll fifteen described the celebration of the Adonia at Alexandria, probably employed elements from the worship of Adonis to describe the death of Daphnis. Consequently, Daphnis should be understood as another version of the sacred shepherd /hunter that was annually lamented throughout the East as Tammuz, Dumuzi, or Adonis. The cult of those heroes was part of the fertility rites in honour of the goddess. Evidence to support the cultic substance of Daphnis is also derived from the bucolic poems of Moschus and Bion.<br /><br />The description of a Cup that Theocritus described before the death of Daphnis in his Idyll enters the forum of debate. Its epic tradition will be covered in one of the thesis' appendices. The third scene on the Cup is especially analysed in relation to eastern religious motifs that Theocritus might have adduced from contemporary literature. The death of Adonis was celebrated by the Greek Adoniazousai of Idyll fifteen as much as by the women of Jerusalem. The scene is compared with the Song of Solomon, a profoundly and unusually erotic poem included in the Old Testament. The poem was probably contemporary with Theocritus (3rd century BC) and its central figures could be identified with Aphrodite and Adonis. The usual argument that Theocritus influenced Hebrew literature is reversed with additional evidence from Bion and Moschus. It is held that the Song was probably derived from the cult of Adonis and could be included in the same tradition as Greek bucolic poetry. Daphnis should be identified with Adonis and be incorporated in the tradition of eastern fertility deities such as Tammuz and Dumuzi.<br /><br />The last part of the chapter examines the actual description of the death of Daphnis who is said to have `gone [to the] river,' an expression that has been much discussed. The report of Daphnis drowning after falling off a rock is compared with famous legends of lovers to whom literature attributed a similar death. It will be argued that Daphnis, as a lover who totally submitted to love, had to experience death symbolically, much like the death that sexual initiation would customarily bring upon the consort(s) of the fertility goddess. A Near Eastern tradition of associating love with death and witchcraft is also identified and Daphnis' representation in Theocritus and Vergil is discussed under the light of this evidence.<br /><br />Appendices<br /><br />Appendix I: The Epic Tradition of the First Idyll<br /><br />The description of the Cup included in the first l dg of Theocritus is regarded as a typical sample of ecphrasis, a technique of delay ng the plot by inserting a detailed description of an object of art. Hellenistic writers in their extensive use of it followed the tradition established by Homer with the description of the Shield of Achilles which was later imitated by the author of the Shield of Heracles, often attributed to Hesiod. It has been argued that the Cup of Theocritus should be included in the epic tradition from which it was inspired.<br /><br />The tw¦Ï epic shields and their mythic owners are compared to Daphnis. It seems that the erotic adventures of Achilles and Heracles could actually provide a convincing framework for the adventures of Daphnis. Heracles, who according to Sositheus, was reputed to have saved Daphnis and his beloved from the hands of the spiteful king Lityerses, had famously died as a lover (rather than a soldier) before being reborn at a higher level. Achilles, who was also identified with excessive lust and grief, was relieved of his sufferings after death in the Isles of the Blessed where he lived happily married to Iphigeneia.<br /><br />The adventures of the tw¦Ï heroes are discussed in the context of ritual transformation and their fortunes are compared with the death of Daphnis. The latter was definitely not an epic warrior; yet he seems to have been a competent `epic' lover.<br /><br />Appendix II: The Cup of Theocritus<br /><br />The three scenes depicted on the Cup are described in relation to the erotic torture of Daphnis. It is argued that the first tw¦Ï images on the Cup treat well-known erotic motifs that refer to the dangers of love. A link between the tale of Daphnis and common ideas about love is established in confirmation of the argument that Theocritus opted for the traditional version of the story.<br /><br />In the first image, motifs regarding the dangerous character of women are treated. Theocritus seems to have inherited his views on the nature of women from Hesiod. In addition, Daphnis' affliction by a woman is probably reflected in the suffering of two young men that pose in the first image on the Cup.<br /><br />The second image refers to a fisherman. In antiquity, the dangers that fishermen face when at sea were often compared with the adventures of lovers. The love of women was also compared to the various moods of the sea itself. Furthermore, the sea was associated with the waters of death and Charon was imagined as a boatman. The possibility that the silent fisherman of the second image alludes to the death of Daphnis because of love is examined.<br /><br />Appendix III: Fishermen: Lovers of Death?<br /><br />In the second scene on the Cup a fisherman is depicted and his possible connotations with the erotic adventure of Daphnis will be presented in Appendix II summarised above. Here the links between the sea and erotic danger are explored and it is argued that the fisherman stands as a reminiscence of the erotic traps that tantalise lovers and indeed Daphnis by the end of the poem.<br /><br />Furthermore, evidence from Greek drama and Hellenistic epigram is gathered in support of an association between fishermen and their implements (nets, hooks etc.) with deaths resulting from or attributed to erotic misconduct. The cases of Agamemnon and Heracles in particularly are discussed.<br /><br />Chapter Three: The Myth of Daphnis (Vergil)<br /><br />The influence that the work of Theocritus has exercised on Vergil is undoubted. The latter introduced Daphnis, Thyrsis, Menalcas and the rest of the bucolic personae in his Eclogues, a collection of poems which along with his Georgics have laid the foundation for a major part of European literature from the days just after Vergil's death until the English pastoral poetry of the sixteenth century and following with Schiller on the continent. The modern criticism on the literary relation of Vergil with Theocritus will be summarised and the view that Vergil showed more understanding of Theocritus than has been assumed will be pursued.<br /><br />Hence, the fact that Vergil presented the death of Daphnis in his Eclogues with close reference to Theocritus, yet he also described the apotheosis of Daphnis in terms similar to the apotheosis of Heracles, should not be regarded as accidental. The comparison of Daphnis with Heracles further developed in Appendix I will be briefly debated here along with the hero's likening to Caesar, whose apotheosis had recently taken place.<br /><br />Furthermore, attention will be drawn to Vergil's technique of attributing to Daphnis features traditionally ascribed to Orpheusand Prometheus, tw¦Ï heroes renowned for their sufferings and their contribution to civilisation. It will be argued that Vergil cast Daphnis in the role of a culture hero with civilising and spiritual powers with the purpose of promoting the pastoral \\"locus amoenus\\" as the ideal place for the spiritual regeneration of the Romans that his poetry anticipates.<br /><br />Vergil transferred the place of Daphnis' suffering from Sicily to Arcadia, a location that according to the tenth Eclogue could accommodate the erotic unhappiness of lovers like Daphnis, Gallus, and Orpheus. The myths that associate Arcadia with early civilisation and the Golden Age are discussed. In his fourth Eclogue, Vergil predicted that Arcadia can be restored and that the Romans will experience a second Golden Age.<br /><br />The identity of the child whose birth, according to Vergil, will bring the realisation of the second Golden Age is examined in the context of rites regarding the absolution of sins and the promise of rebirth. The Orph¨ªc and Dionysian mysteries are particularly discussed, on the strength of tw¦Ï factors: Vergil referred to the cradle of the child that will blossom automatically, a motif mentioned in the birth of Dionysus. In addition, at the end of the fourth Eclogue Vergil compared himself with Orpheus and Linus, who were associated with the mysteries of Dionysus. Vergil's comparison is discussed in detail and the conclusion reached is that the poet favoured ancient rites in which the birth of a child was regarded as the obvious sign for the gratification of the devotees. In this context, the Eleusinian mysteries are also brought into discussion.<br /><br />It seems that Vergil appreciated these mysteries because of their agricultural character; this idea is also supported by his effort to link the Golden Age with agriculture in his Georgics. The last part of the chapter argues that in doing so, Vergil does not contradict Hesiod who also referred to the Golden Age conditions as preserved in the righteous caste of the farmers.<br /><br />Chapter Four: Poetry and Vergil<br /><br />The comparison of Vergil with Orpheus brings to light the question of Vergil's stance in this New Order of things that he prophesised. Traditionally poetry was associated with erotic passion and as covered in the previous chapter, Arcadia seemed hospitable to both notions. Nevertheless, art and intemperate lust as ideally<br /><br />combined in the legendary figure of Orpheus were radically opposed to the hereditary views of the Romans. This short chapter deals with the basic inconsistency of suggesting Arcadia as the ideological foreground of the Roman renaissance.<br /><br />In a world in which, according to the first and the ninth Eclogues, poetry is shown to be ineffective, the answer seems to lie with the farmer that Vergil depicted in his Georgics as enjoying some of the advantages of the Golden Age. In the third book of the Georgics the farmer was seen as carefully arranging the mating of his animals, imposing his iron will over irrational sexual instinct. Vergil's view of love is presented as a creative force, sexual as much as spiritual.<br /><br />This study supports the view that the farmer represents the ideal statesman of an ideal state as reflected in the society of the bees of the fourth Georgic. The bees have a special claim to the Golden Age as well as in poetic tradition. The view that Vergil did not refer to the bees' association with poetry because he wished to banish it from the new society that was about to arise is challenged.<br /><br />On the contrary, Vergil's posture as the bard of the new era is examined. Vergil like Hesiod, Orpheus, and Silenus, moves between legend and universal truth, and restores the role of the ancient \\"vates\\" to its previous status. Vergil poses as the hierophant of the new era, who finds in poetic tradition the solutions for a secure future. Vergil's appreciation of poetry anticipates a more optimistic reading of the fourth Georgic.<br /><br />Chapter Five: Orpheus and Aristaeus<br /><br />The fourth book of the Georgics treated the story of Orpheus and Aristaeus. The argument that Vergil invented the story in which Aristaeus is responsible for the death of Eurydice is questioned. This book has raised a great many discussions regarding Servius' comments according to which Vergil had included in the last part of the book praises for his friend Gallus, a poet and politician who committed suicide after losing favour with young Octavian, the monarch that was later called Augustus 44 The view that Augustus<br /><br />ordered Vergil to exchange the \\"laudes Galli\\" with the verses that now contain the epyllion of Orpheus and Aristaeus is disputed. The more moderate view that Vergil probably changed a few verses in the second edition of the book (if there was ever a second edition) is adopted.<br /><br />The importance of the bees has already been discussed in the previous chapter in association with the poetry of Vergil and the Golden Age. However, in this chapter the bees are examined as a bridge between the Hesiodic Golden Age and the agricultural version that Vergil puts forward. Through their association with the cult of Zeus, the bees pose as the tangible example of Zeus' theodicy. The Bugonia is examined as Aristaeus' reply to the sacrificial codes of Prometheus, which brought about the separation of man from god. Aristaeus is seen as a heroic embodiment of the justice of Zeus.<br /><br />However, the expiation of guilt, which Aristaeus secured through the Begonia, has been the preoccupation of several mystery cults in antiquity, pre-eminently of the Orphic mysteries and those of Demeter atEleusis. The association of these cults with bees and honey is stressed. Furthermore, the Orphic views on sexuality and justice seem to have been in close compliance with the morals of the new era according to which Aristaeus is punished for his lust.<br /><br />The claim of Aristaeus, Orpheus, and Eurydice in the tradition of bees and honey seems to link them with initiatory patterns in the context of prenuptial rites. Aristaeus' stance as a solemn husband and pious beekeeper, the bees' hostility towards adulterers, and the rape of Eurydice by Aristaeus are all brought into discussion. A comparison of Eurydice with Persephone, which originates from the relation of bees with the cult of Demeter and Kore, seems to support this conclusion. It is argued that the story of Orpheus and Aristaeus is employed as an example of restoration within the new order of Zeus, a restoration that Vergil wishes for the total of the Roman nation that has just emerged from civil war.<br /><br />Throughout the chapter, a parallelism between Aristaeus and Orpheus is constructed with the intention of emphasising their similarities. Initially Aeneas and then Prometheus are invoked as a reference point for the comparison. According to the evidence<br /><br />presented, Aristaeus and Orpheus shared a number of similarities in their legendary aspects as culture heroes and as deities.<br /><br />Orpheus, who was additionally reputed as author of cathartic poetry and magical spells, had repeatedly attracted the criticism of Plato who despised all miracle-workers, and indeed Orpheus as much as Pythagoras, who was accused for passing off his writings as those of the legendary poet. This aspect of Orpheus does not seemingly correspond to the character of Aristaeus as depicted in Vergil. At this point of the analysis the name and legend of Ans teas of Proconnesus is also discussed.<br /><br />His identification with Aristaeus is argued on the basis of three comparisons: firstly, on Aristeas' similarity with Prometheus as it emerges through the similarities of pseudo-Aeschylus' Prometheus Vinctus and Aristeas' epic about the Arimaspeans. Secondly, on Aristeas' association with Egypt and magicians; Vergil significantly suggested Egypt as the place that the Bugonia was practised while a combination of the traditions of Aristaeus and Aristeas survives in late literature. Thirdly, on Aristeas' connection with Pythagoras and his rites which were in essence Orphic. It is argued that even if syncretism should be suspected in Vergil's treatment, the poet understood these rituals as similar in essence and as functioning within the new order of Zeus. The message conveyed is that under the new theodicy salvation is possible as long as disordered eros, as represented by Orpheus, is replaced by methodically channelled energy dedicated to the recreation of well being.<br /><br />Appendix IV: Orpheus, Pythagoras and the Egyptians<br /><br />The fourth appendix discusses the connection of Pythagoras and Oprheus with the Egyptians based on Herodotus 2.81, a text where special reference is made to the prohibition of wool in burials. The custom, which applied to the initiates of specific rites, is traced in Egypt but also in Greece, and its origins raised many disputes in classical scholarship. Herodotus employed four adjectives to describe the rites in which this custom was observed, although interpolation by a later commentator is very possible. The rites are described as Orphic, Bacchic, Egyptian, and Pythagorean. Despite the longstanding debate over the meaning and the syntax of the lines it would be useful to accept that already in antiquity the rites mentioned above were understood to be similar. This is further confirmed by the syncretism that is noticed in the treatment of these rites by a series of ancient writers. Apuleius and Vergil are mentioned as tw¦Ï of them. Hence, the comment of Herodotus (or indeed of a later scholar) would simply reflect the affinity of the rites as already understood in antiquity.Furthermore, attention will be drawn to Vergil's technique of attributing to Daphnis features traditionally ascribed to Orpheusand Prometheus, tw heroes renowned for their sufferings and their contribution to civilisation. It will be argued that Vergil cast Daphnis in the role of a culture hero with civilising and spiritual powers with the purpose of promoting the pastoral \\"locus amoenus\\" as the ideal place for the spiritual regeneration of the Romans that his poetry anticipates. <br />Vergil transferred the place of Daphnis' suffering from Sicily to Arcadia, a location that according to the tenth Eclogue could accommodate the erotic unhappiness of lovers like Daphnis, Gallus, and Orpheus.

US	52886341	R158Q1KWVKUNZU	1405118997	33855594	Keeping God's Silence: Towards a Theological Ethics of Communication (Challenges in Contemporary Theology)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Important Feminist Christology of Openness	Keeping God's Silence: Towards A Theological Ethics of Communication by Rachel Muers (Challenges in Contemporary Theology: Blackwell Publishers) (Paperback) This ground-breaking hook provides a new perspective on Christian practices of silence.<br /><br />Rachel Muffs, a significant Quaker theologian, develops a theological understanding of communication to which a \\"responsible silence\\" is central. In doing so, she engages with the key issues raised for Christian theology by feminist thought, and develops an original reading of significant aspects of the theology and ethics of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. She also presents a challenge, from the perspective of Christian theology and practice, to a communicative environment dominated by wars of words. The central theological claim explored in the book is that God listens, and that God's listening is integral to who God is.<br /><br />Excerpt: The first chapter concentrates on listening to feminist thinkers - includ¬ing feminist theologians - as they put forward analyses and critiques of the many ways in which women have been silenced in theology and in other areas of discourse; and to an analysis and critique from within Christian theology of the many ways in which God has been silenced in the modern world. Both of these accounts of silencing, as I read them, tend to make the assumption that agency in communication rests wholly or mainly with the speaker - in other words, that silence cannot be rightly or usefully thought of as communicative activity. In feminist thought, however, this assumption is problematized, with the recognition of women's complicity in their own \\"silencing,\\" and of the acts of silencing of which feminist discourse has itself been guilty. There is a recognition<br /><br />that, if this kind of oppressive silencing is to end, the communicative sit¬uation must be fundamentally transformed; and some attempts to imagine that transformation involve the rethinking of what silence means.<br /><br />The feminist theologian Nelle Morton is well known for her concept of \\"hearing into speech,\\" which she develops theologically with the counter-intuitive claim that the \\"first cause is hearing,\\" and the questions that pervade her writing: \\"Who hears? Who is heard?\\". In the second chapter, I look at Morton's thought alongside the philosophy of Gemma Corradi Fiumara, whose approach to the ethics of communication gives priority to listening, and analyze the questions \\"Who hears? Who is heard?\\" as they denote two forms of silence - the silence of the listener, and the \\"silence of unknowability\\" signifying the freedom of the one who is listened to. Questions then arise about the theological development of such readings of silence. How can God be affirmed as the source and aim of a changed ethics of communication, without re-imposing powerful divine speech in a way that negates the aims of feminist thought?<br /><br />Reading Morton's questions as theological - as questions about God as the one \\"who hears\\" and \\"who is heard\\" - the third chapter outlines the basic framework of my response to these problems, through a discussion of Bonhoeffer's theology of the resurrection. The key categories of Bonhoeffer's thought on which my reading is based are set out: the resur¬rection as that which determines the asking and answering of the \\"Who?\\" question in relation to Christ; closely linked with this, the resurrection as the \\"place to stand,\\" the hidden basis for action and reflection from which a response to the world is possible; and the interpretation of ethical life in terms of the \\"relation between reality and realization.\\" I argue that this set of categories enables us to speak about God's silence of unknowability - the resurrection as a \\"hidden\\" reality - and God's silence as a listener's silence - the resurrection as reality being \\"realized,\\" as God hears God's own Word and thereby hears the world into new possibilities.<br /><br />In each of the subsequent chapters, further reflection on the naming of God as one who hears - and hence on the \\"reality\\" of the resurrec¬tion for God and for the world in relation to God - is closely bound up with the analysis of particular practices of communication, thinking through an ethics of communication alongside the development of the theology. In the fourth chapter, I begin my consideration of what it would mean for a communicative situation to be transformed in the light of the resurrection as God's hearing of God's own Word. The resurrection does not mean that the powerful Word of God reduces all other words to silence, but rather that the whole situation of speaking, silence, and lis¬tening must be reconfigured Christologically.<br /><br />Feminist critiques of Christian theology's acts of \\"silencing\\" have focused on the characterization of humanity as silent or passive vis-&agrave;-vis the powerful Word of God. The fifth chapter suggests how a theology of divine hearing - of the world together with the divine Word - can respond to this critique, and can shift the focus of an ethic of communi¬cation toward an emphasis on the capacity for listening. Analyzing spe¬cific texts of Bonhoeffer's theology, I argue that his work points to a deep concern for a contemporary communicative situation in which there is \\"too much talk\\" and not enough silence, in which the capacity for lis¬tening and discernment has been lost, and in which the recognition of the resurrection as \\"place to stand\\" and as divine act of hearing provides the possible basis for a recovery of that capacity.<br /><br />The sixth chapter examines practices of communication - to which silence is fundamental - in which this \\"reconfiguration\\" might be seen. I consider Bonhoeffer's lectures on \\"spiritual care,\\" in which the media¬tion of communication in Christ - the resurrection as common \\"place to stand\\" - is a central idea. This Christological mediation of communica¬tion establishes, first, the \\"unknowability\\" of the other - the impossibil¬ity either of exercising control over her or of subjecting oneself entirely to her words. Practices of silence, described in the lectures on spiritual care, signify and enact this unknowability.<br /><br />Responsible silence as Christians practice it - in relationships of \\"spir¬itual care\\" and elsewhere - does not, however, merely signify and enact unknowability. More importantly, people can learn to \\"hear with God's ears,\\" and hence to be drawn into God's act of hearing with love. The keeping of silence can make any given practice of communication open to transformations, which are not anticipated in advance but which can reflect the innerworldly realization of divine reality. Two aspects of such transformation in and through practices of communication are the learn¬ing of ethical discernment and the emergence of friendship. Taking these seriously in the context of thinking about \\"hearing with God's ears,\\" I suggest, both relies on and enriches an understanding of the resurrection as reality for God - God's self-determination as love.<br /><br />Both the idea of the \\"unknowability\\" of the other and the question of what it means to \\"hear with God's ears\\" are developed further in the seventh chapter. Here, I use the idea of \\"knowing by hearing\\" as part of a response to contemporary debates on the question of privacy. The aspect of personal \\"unknowability\\" - which prevents the person from being \\"silenced\\" by reduction to a fully comprehensible object of knowledge - is a point of contact with the modern concern for privacy. However, the terms in which the concern for privacy is couched - which require<br /><br />knowledge to be understood as controllable and defensible property, and which even affect some recent accounts of divine omniscience - are called into question by the Christological understanding of God's \\"hearing knowledge\\" developed in this thesis. \\"Hearing knowledge\\" is inseparable from relationships of responsibility and love, and from the formationof persons over time in relation to others. I am not rejecting the importance of privacy and reserve for the ethics of communication; in fact, the concern for privacy is linked ultimately to the concern, voiced repeatedly throughout my discussion, to say something about the reality of God in Godself.<br /><br />The concluding chapter suggests further possible implications of this account of \\"God's responsible silence.\\" Some of these relate to theology's own ethics of communication - for responses to acts of silencing, for bib¬lical interpretation and for the reading of theological texts. Beyond this, however, I attempt to open up consideration of the wider consequences of an ethics of communication that takes \\"responsible silence\\" seriously.<br /><br />Openings are, not accidentally, a theme of the conclusion. One of my key claims about practices of communication is that both writers and readers, speakers and hearers, should seek to hold utterances and texts open for further acts of hearing - an openness that does not preclude, but rather relies on, present commitment to specific claims and contexts, in the universal but also specific context of God's act of hearing. I have sought to do justice to, and to maintain, the openness of the texts I read. For the future openness of my own text, I am dependent on others.ting oneself entirely to her words. Practices of silence, described in the lectures on spiritual care, signify and enact this unknowability. <br />Responsible silence as Christians practice it - in relationships of \\"spiritual care\\" and elsewhere - does not, however, merely signify and enact unknowability. More importantly, people can learn to \\"hear with God's ears,\\" and hence to be drawn into God's act of hearing with love. The keeping of silence can make any given practice of communication open to transformations, which are not anticipated in advance but which can reflect the innerworldly realization of divine reality. Two aspects of such transformation in and through practices of communication are the learning of ethical discernment and the emergence of friendship. Taking these seriously in the context of thinking about \\"hearing with God's ears,\\" I suggest, both relies on and enriches an understanding of the resurrection as reality for God - God's self-determination as love. <br />Both the idea of the \\"unknowability\\" of the other and the question of what it means to \\"hear with God's ears\\" are developed further in the seventh chapter. Here, I use the idea of \\"knowing by hearing\\" as part of a response to contemporary debates on the question of privacy. The aspect of personal \\"unknowability\\" - which prevents the person from being \\"silenced\\" by reduction to a fully comprehensible object of knowledge - is a point of contact with the modern concern for privacy. However, the terms in which the concern for privacy is couched - which require <br />knowledge to be understood as controllable and defensible property, and which even affect some recent accounts of divine omniscience - are called into question by the Christological understanding of God's \\"hearing knowledge\\" developed in this thesis. \\"Hearing knowledge\\" is inseparable from relationships of responsibility and love, and from the formation of persons over time in relation to others.

One of my key claims about practices of communication is that both writers and readers, speakers and hearers, should seek to hold utterances and texts open for further acts of hearing - an openness that does not preclude, but rather relies on, present commitment to specific claims and contexts, in the universal but also specific context of God's act of hearing. I have sought to do justice to, and to maintain, the openness of the texts I read. For the future openness of my own text, I am dependent on others. <br />	2005-05-03

The first chapter deals with the entry into the land and includes the cameo stories of Adoni-bezek who lost thumbs and big toes, Achsah who asked for water, and Othniel the first \\"judge\\" (Judg 1:1-3:11); the second chapter is on Ehud's assassination of Ehud (Judg 3:12-31); the third chapter covers Deborah and Barak defeating Sisera, and Jael putting a spike through his head (Judges 4-5); the fourth chapter discusses Gideon testing God and defeating the Ammonites (Judges 6-8), and the next its sequel, Abimelech's abortive kingship (Judges 9); the sixth chapter examines Jephthah, his vow, and his daughter's sacrifice (Judges 10-12); the seventh chapter deals<br /><br />with Samson the Nazirite, from annunciation to self-immolation, and, of course, his Timnite bride, the prostitute of Gaza, and Delilah (Judges 13-16); the eighth chapter treats Micah, his Levite, and the rampaging Danites (Judges 17-18); and the ninth chapter closes with a story of rape writ large, the Levite's woman and the Benjamite war (Judges 19-21).<br /><br />Each chapter begins with an abstract of the story (the \\"argument;\\" as older commentaries called it) and a summary of the discussion. (Names are given as commonly found in English, usually Protestant, sources, with Catholic alternatives where these differ.) A reader desiring a brief overview of responses to Judges over the centuries is invited to read through these summaries. Two main sections follow: \\"Ancient and Medieval\\" and \\"Early Modern and Modern.\\" The former runs from Josephus and Pseudo-Philo, includes the clas¬sical texts of rabbinic Judaism, the Christian Fathers of Late Antiquity, and sources from the Middle Ages. It concludes with the fifteenth century and the onset of printing. The latter starts with the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation, and continues through the Enlightenment up to the present day. Given its extent, this section is often broken up into topics, often main characters - for example, in the third chapter, \\"Deborah,\\" \\"Barak, Sisera, and Sisera's mother,\\" \\"Jael\\" - or main talking points - in the seventh chapter, \\"Typology,\\" \\"Edifying history,\\" \\"Foxes and fire,\\" \\"Captivity and death,\\" among others. By and large each section or subsection proceeds chronologically from earlier to later sources, and often the chapter ends with a \\"Recent reception\\" subsection focusing mainly on scholarly reception over the past century. This last review will seem cursory (to say the least), given conventional commen¬taries, but it does attempt to give the reader interested in the state of Judges scholarship today some guidelines.<br /><br />The illustrations offer a small sample of the visual art of Judges, with pref¬erence given to works originally designed for reproduction, such as print suites or Bible illustrations, and to published engravings of paintings rather than photographs of the original, since these are what most people saw before the late nineteenth century. Because of limitations of space, most of the plates are composites of pictures, many of them cropped or providing detail only and much reduced, so providing only a flavor of the real thing. The folio engrav¬ings of Gerard Hoet and Caspar Luyken, for example, are magnificent, far beyond what can be conveyed here.<br /><br />The Bibliography at the end of the book is subdivided into Ancient and Medieval, Early Modern and Modern, and Graphical sources. It is followed by a complete list of illustrations. Also included in the end matter are a short glos¬sary of terms, events, and interpretive methods perhaps unfamiliar to some readers, and a set of brief biographies (where information was available). Anindex of names includes both primary and secondary-source authors, and an index of main subjects concludes the book.<br /><br />A few idiosyncrasies need to be mentioned. First concerns the reference system. In the main text, the date supplied for a source is the original (as best could be determined). Details in square brackets are those of the edition used, when it is reasonably certain that its content does not differ significantly from the original. In the bibliography, however, a date in square brackets is the original, and the principal date is that of the edition used. Second concerns the reference materials. There are many secondary sources discussing topics covered here. That they are not mentioned does not mean that they are unavailable. But I have chosen to focus on primary sources, and the bibliography reflects this choice. Third, where possible, life-spans are supplied when (deceased) authors and artists are first mentioned, as well as dates of their works. Likewise a few words describing the person are offered. In larger chapters, where a reader may be consulting only one section, this information is sometimes repeated. The result may appear (and be) inconsis¬tent as well as redundant to some readers, but it is intended to be helpful to others.rst concerns the reference system.

The results are spectacular. The subject matter, besides being immensely informative, is riveting. This book, besides deepening the psychoanalytic situation, extends applied analysis another level, from the inanimate to man's next of kin. The spectrum of animals studied is dazzling, provocative and always thought-provoking. It is psychoanalytic, each animal viewed from philia to phobia, from unconscious to conscious effects, thorough at every level.<br /><br />Every contribution resounds with its relevance to clinical work and every day observations. The scholarship is historical, prehistorical, even paleontological, ranges over myths, religious worship, rituals, language, folklore, symbols, art and always clinical data, from Freud's to our own with a special bounty to dreams and nightmares. Detailed clinical examples capture the richness of the intrapsychic and interpersonal places that animals inhabit in our psyches. The book encompasses the role of animals not only in normal development and psychopathology but also in history and mythology. Mental health professionals will listen to their patients with new sensitivities after the Mental Zoo introduces them to this fascinating menagerie. Several of the chapters will be classics. The book as a whole is more than a compendium; it's an encyclopedia.<br /><br />Contents<br /><br />1. Animals in Psychiatric Symptomatology<br /><br />2. Rat People<br /><br />3.

We hunt them, breed them, clothe ourselves with them and eat them for dinner (as they sometimes do us). They populate our literature, myths, religions, arts, our language and its metaphors, and they haunt our unconscious fantasies and our dreams. The profoundest, fiercest, and most intimate urges and feelings within us are our animal passions and instincts. The parade of animals that accompany us through life is held up for review and appreciation in these delightful essays, all of which share a dedication to the understanding of  human life and culture through the lens of psychoanalytic theory in its manifold diversity. This book is a major contribution to culture and psychoanalytic literature. From the prehistoric art of Lascaux to Picasso, from The Fly to the American eagle, the psychoanalytic perceptions are subtle and suggestive, the aesthetic, film, and national insights are a delight.<br /><br />Contents<br /><br />Cross-Cultural Perspectives on the Bond Between Man and Animals<br /><br />Dreams of Animals<br /><br />Human to Animal Transformations in Literature<br /><br />Animals in Children's Stories<br /><br />Artists and Beasts<br /><br />Animals, Music, and Psychoanalysis<br /><br />Animals and Religion<br /><br />An Annotated Visit to the Cinematic Zoo Immigration<br /><br />National Identity and Animals	2005-04-14

Love and Hate seeks to answer some important questions about these all consuming passions. Many patients seeking psychotherapy feel unlovable or full of rage and hate.<br /><br />What is it that interferes with the capacity to experience love? This book explores the origins of love and hate from infancy and how they develop through the life cycle. It brings together contemporary views about clinical practice on how psychotherapists and analysts work with and think about love and hate in the transference and countertransference and explores how different schools of thought deal with the subject. David Mann, together with an impressive array of international contributors represents a broad spectrum of psychoanalytic perspectives, including Kleinian, Jungian, Independent Group, and Lacanian, psychotherapists, psychoanalysts and analytical psychologists.<br /><br />With emphasis on clinical illustration throughout, the writers show how different psychoanalytic schools think about and clinically work with the experience and passions of love and hate. It will be invaluable to practitioners and students of psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, analytical psychology and counseling.<br /><br />Contents<br /><br />1. In Search of Love and Hate.

US	52886341	R2A1GLNKXIZXS1	1588115615	381963400	A History of Language Philosophies (Studies in the History of the Language Sciences)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Concise and Informative	A History Of Language Philosophies by Lia Formigari (Studies in the History of the Language Sciences: John Benjamins Publishing) (Hardcover) Formigari is clear from the start that there can be no single perspective in the philosophical study of language. He focuses mainly on two approaches: the study of language as a cognitive tool and the study of its essential phylogenetic components. Language is always reluctant to be trapped exclusively in one domain or the other - the domain of liberty, the domain of necessity; the domain of the historical sciences, the domain of the natural sciences. Every time we isolate one of these domains, we realize we have answered only half the questions posed by theories. This happens if the notion of arbitrariness of signs is privileged at the expense of material, vocal, psychomotor language components, or vice versa; if language is considered exclusively as a product of nature or, on the contrary, of culture; if the role of innate mechanisms is stressed exclusively as opposed to learning, or vice versa.<br /><br />As a result, Formigari tried to divorce linguistic-cognitive theories as little as possible from discussions on language as a specific instinct of humans as members of the animal world. The subdivision into cognitively-oriented chapters and anthropologically-oriented ones serves a practical purpose only. It helps distin¬guish different itineraries on the same map, avoiding the risk of getting sidetracked into roundabout routes, crooked alleys, or dead-ends. Cross-references among chapters should be taken as street signs suggesting other possibilities to those interested in following alternative routes or carving their own path.<br /><br />The approach of a study is determined not solely by theoretical motives, but also, inevitably, by practical constraints. What is not to be found in this book, due to space limitations, is any history of individual language sciences (grammar, for example, or rhetoric). However, Formigari provided information on the great partitions of linguistic knowledge, and references that should help readers to orient themselves, highlighting the intersections of the philosophical study of language with the theory and practice of the language sciences. For reasons of space and competence, this book deals with only one intellectual tradition, the Western one; also, for the Middle Ages, the focus is exclusively on the Latin world...<br /><br />Semantics (the study of the relation between linguistic and real entities), pragmatics (the study of the purpose and conditions of sentences), and syntax (the study of the properties of verbal signs and their relations) have been a dominant triad in language studies since 1938 when the American philosopher Charles Morris introduced this division, derived from Peirce. It has recently been challenged by Chomsky, who subsumes into syntax the core of his cognitive approach, i.e. the analytical aspects of meaning, leaving all other aspects to pragmatics, dismissed as an irredeemably non-scientific practice. Cognitive semantics has recently brought out the semantic import of grammatical categories and claimed scientific respectability for the study of semantic functions involved in conceptualization. This has made the boundaries between these three traditional areas even more permeable. Finally, the encounter with cognitive science has tempered the anti-psychologist tendency that had long been a distinctive trait of analytic philoso¬phy. It would seem that language needs to be explained more and more in the context of a general theory of the mind, and is less and less a universal pass-partout that will open the doors of every philosophical closet. This change has expanded the epistemic potential of philosophy to an extent it is still difficult to assess. For language theories, too, the `rediscovery of the mind' seems destined to become a new frontier.ormation on the great partitions of linguistic knowledge, and references that should help readers to orient themselves, highlighting the intersections of the philosophical study of language with the theory and practice of the language sciences.

Medical Personal and Professional Development	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Whimsy with Serious Intent	Pilgrims In Medicine: Conscience, Legalism And Human Rights: An Allegory of Medical Humanities, Foundational Virtues, Ethical Principles, Law and Human Rights in Medical Personal and Professional Development by Thomas Alured Faunce (Martinus Nijhoff: Brill Academic Publishers) Unabashedly literary, allusive and dialogic, Faunce has created a synthetic account of the humane issues involved in the doctor-patient relationship. The work challenges clinicians to approach whole to whole in the dance or as Fanunce fancies it, pilgrimage, that practice of medicine can become even in our highly technocratic institutions of medicine. Part spiritual direction, legal treatise, bioethics premier, and, with always an eye for the formation of personhood of the physician, this work deserves a wide professional readership.<br /><br />This arrestingly novel work develops a normative synthesis of medical humanities, virtue ethics, medical ethics, health law and human rights. It presents an ambitious, complex and coherent argument for the reconceptualisation of the doctor-patient relationship and its regulation utilising approaches often thought of as being separate, if not opposed (virtue-based ethics and universal human rights). The case is argued gracefully, with moderation, but also with respect for opposing positions.<br /><br />The book's analysis of the foundational professional virtue of therapeutic loyalty is an original departure from the traditional discourse of patient autonomy, and the ethical and legal duties of the medical practitioner. The central argument is not merely presented, as bookends, in the introduction and conclusion. It is cogently represented in each chapter and section and measured against the material considered.<br /><br />A remarkable feature is the use of aptly selected \\"canonical\\" literature to inform the argument. These references run from Hesse's The Glass Bead Game in the abstract, to Joyce's Ulysses in the conclusion. They include excerpts from and discussion about Bergman, Borges, Boswell, Tolstoy, de Beauvoir, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Samuel Johnson, Aristotle, Orwell, Osler, Chaucer, Schweitzer, Shakespeare, Thorwalds, Kafka and William Carlos Williams. Such references are used not merely as an artistic and decorative leitmotif, but become a critical, narrative element and another complex and rich layer to this work. The breadth and quality of the references are testimony to the author's clear understanding of the modern law and literature movement.<br /><br />This work provides the basis of a medical school course. As many medical educators as possible should also be encouraged to read this work for the insights it will give them into using their own personal life narratives and those of their patients to inform their decision-making process. It will also be of value to the judiciary, whose members are often called upon to make normatively difficult judgments about medical care and medical rules.<br /><br />The human rights material leads to a hopeful view of an international movement toward a universal synthesis between medical ethics and human rights in all doctor-patient relationships.<br /><br /> Abstract: Soon, the 21st century's vast aggregate of clinical medical encoun¬ters and the comparatively smaller volume of professional and aca¬demic commentary upon them, will, like those remnants from the Hippocratic age, distort into the ambiguous strata of history. Scholars may then seek to sift those narratives for relics testifying to important themes.<br /><br />This work suggests some such thematic candidates. To emphasise their humanity and inherent dignity, they have been made here into literary characters. They will be shown progressing through the vary¬ing quadrants of their fated careers, from medical students into pro¬fessional practice, retirement and death.<br /><br />This interdisciplinary technique draws upon an established liter¬ary genre involving personification of the virtues and vices.' It seems a vehicle well serviced to attempt a conceptual tour that integrates those hitherto dispersed academic hamlets known as moral philoso¬phy, virtue ethics, medical humanities, bioethics, jurisprudence, health law and human rights. Like Prudentius' Psychomachia or \\"soul bat¬tle,\\" their tales may often resemble dynamic \\"inward\\" struggles between opposing moral values. Indeed, it has been argued that the contesting imagined persons from the Psychomachia (for example, Fides, Spes, Sobrietas and Ira) actually represented dieties and dae¬monic powers in the heart of man.'<br /><br />As Chaucer gave us a brief sketch of those pilgrims setting out from the Tabard to Canterbury, so will I now the personified med¬ical students whose journeys in conscience are narrated in these pages.<br /><br />\\"Genome\\", as we first meet him, is an ambitious young man who, with little difficulty, has graduated from science to study medicine.<br /><br />Married with two children, he carries more weight than he should and wears glasses. Genome is proud of his cultural background. His father, a Greek fisherman who worked on trawlers and his Egyptian mother, have much love for him but little comprehension of the amount of study required to be successful in such a course. Genome's dream is to buy an established home in the wealthiest suburb of town. He has not accepted a rural-bonded scholarship from the Uqbari Government.<br /><br />\\"Human Rights\\" is a young, female graduate of law, enlivened by righteous anger in her pursuit of injustice. She is involved in many politically active groups on campus and lives with a group of like-minded friends. Human Rights is a vegetarian and wears clothes she makes herself. Her family were Cambodian farmers who nar¬rowly escaped the atrocities of Pol Pot's \\"Year Zero\\". Human Rights has a right arm that is a little shorter than her left, with a scar across the prominent knuckle.<br /><br />The third character, a self-assured honours law graduate, depicts a regulatory attitude referred to in this book as \\"Legalism.\\" Legalism and Human Rights were living together, but have recently separated. Legalism's parents have bought him a house in a leafy suburb near the University in which to stay for the duration of the medical course. Legalism keeps fit through involvement in many sporting activities in which he displays gifts of natural prowess that provoke much envy. His mother is a Muslim who fled Iraq and has separated from her community. His father is a third generation Uqbarian sheep and wheat farmer. Legalism intends to practise medicine in a rural location in Uqbar, but has not accepted a rural-bonded scholarship, as he wants to keep open the option of gaining clinical experience in a major urban teaching centre. Legalism has never failed an exam and has an aura of almost invincible optimism.<br /><br />Our fourth character, boasting an eccentric graduate education in the humanities, is \\"Virtue Ethics.\\" Virtue ethics has been twice divorced and is currently enjoying the relative ease of a bachelor's life. He has written a well-received treatise on the virtues and vices in English literature and regularly pens acerbic and sarcastic book reviews for the Times Literary Supplement, Quadrant and the London Review of Books. He lives on campus in post-graduate accommodation acquired by a bureaucratic ruse. He periodically makes it a rule that all vis¬itors must enter his room wearing one of the amusing hats racked by his door. He is frequently found at the bar, amiably intoxicated, smoking a variety of licit and illicit substances and philosophising. His family once had a country home in Sussex, England. His mother was the daughter of a Jewish refugee and his father the last of a long line of British soldiers.

Players of the Glass Bead Game use the symbols and formulas of a common language created from music, philosophy, art, architecture, literature, mathematics, ethics and law. They begin by stating, then elaborating, varying and developing themes in the manner, simultaneously, of, for example, a Bach fugue, a Shakespearean tragedy, a Gothic cathedral, a philo¬sophical work by Immanuel Kant, a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, the Mahabharata, Illiad, Basho's Narrow Road to the Deep North even, one presumes, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br /><br />\\"For a long time\\" writes Hesse \\"one school of players favoured the technique of stating side by side, developing in counterpoint, and finally harmoniously combining two hostile themes or ideas, such as law and freedom, individual and community.\\" The aims of the Glass Bead Game are obscure, but appear to involve providing a source of spiritual aspiration for society and the acquisition of virtue by its participants.<br /><br />The \\"Student Life\\" section strives to resemble the tempo and tone of that great conversation of humanity beginning with the Kyrie of Bach's Mass in B Minor. Here we gradually perceive the key ele¬ments and interactions of conscience, virtue ethics and medical human¬ities. By the \\"Professional Practise\\" section, echoing the Gloria and Credo of the B Minor Mass, we begin to integrate these with med¬ical ethics, health law and human rights. The notion is gradually introduced that we may view this integrated scheme of doctor-patient relations either as a positivistic enforcement pyramid, or as a more probabilistic community of principle clouding round conscience and personal and professional narrative coherence. All these concepts are drawn together and critiqued in the final section, \\"Retirement,\\" which tries to echo elements of the Santus and Agnus Dei components of the great Mass.<br /><br />The literary narratives and works of art related to doctor-patient relations, discussed throughout this text, have an important norma¬tive function. This begins with their alleged enhanced capacity to activate conscience toward relief of patient suffering. It culminates in the integrated professional regulatory system you will find, shall you read on.<br /><br />Everyman: \\"Death, if I should this pilgrimage take,<br /><br />And my reckoning surely make,<br /><br />Show me, for saint charity,<br /><br />Should I not come again shortly?\\"<br /><br />Death: \\"No, Everyman; and thou be once there,<br /><br />Thou mayst never more come here,<br /><br />Trust me verily.\\"sm and Human Rights were living together, but have recently separated.

Here we gradually perceive the key elements and interactions of conscience, virtue ethics and medical humanities. By the \\"Professional Practise\\" section, echoing the Gloria and Credo of the B Minor Mass, we begin to integrate these with medical ethics, health law and human rights. The notion is gradually introduced that we may view this integrated scheme of doctor-patient relations either as a positivistic enforcement pyramid, or as a more probabilistic community of principle clouding round conscience and personal and professional narrative coherence. All these concepts are drawn together and critiqued in the final section, \\"Retirement,\\" which tries to echo elements of the Santus and Agnus Dei components of the great Mass. <br />The literary narratives and works of art related to doctor-patient relations, discussed throughout this text, have an important normative function. This begins with their alleged enhanced capacity to activate conscience toward relief of patient suffering. It culminates in the integrated professional regulatory system you will find, shall you read on. <br />Everyman: \\"Death, if I should this pilgrimage take,  <br />And my reckoning surely make, <br />Show me, for saint charity, <br />Should I not come again shortly?\\" <br />Death: \\"No, Everyman; and thou be once there,  <br />Thou mayst never more come here,  <br />Trust me verily.\\" <br />	2005-03-14

Soloveitchik by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, edited by Nathaniel Helfgot (MeOtzar HoRav Series: Selected Writing of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Volume 4: KTAV) Community, Covenant and Commitment is the fourth volume in the series MeOtzar HoRav: Selected Writings of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. It includes more than seventy private and public letters written by the Rav -as Rabbi Soloveitchik was widely known-- as well as a number of detailed interviews conducted with him over the span of some forty years. These materials give us a further glimpse into the prodigious thought of this leader of American Orthodoxy in the crucial decades both prior to and following the Second World War.<br /><br />The volume is divided into sections focusing on critical areas in which rabbis as well as political, educational, and communal leaders turned to Rabbi Soloveitchik for guidance and insight. In addition, it includes selected letters initiated by the Rav on topics close to his heart in areas of communal, theological, philosophical and personal concerns. Specifically, the volume contains six sections containing letters and communications on areas of: Communal and Public Policy, Educational Issues, American Orthodoxy and the Rabbinate, Religious Zionism and the State of Israel, Inter-Religious Affairs and personal and Philosophical Reflections.<br /><br />The topics addressed in this volume reflect the entire panoply of concerns that confronted the Orthodox and general Jewish community as its matured and grew in the hospitable setting of the American scene. Together with that, the rise of the modern State of Israel and the challenges that this posed became a focal point of the American Jewish community as well as of the thinking of the Rav. Topics include communal policy for Jewish adoption agencies, interfaith discussions with the Catholic Church, religious and theological attitudes to the State of Israel, interdenominational activities within the Jewish community, advanced Jewish education for young women, the training of learned and professional rabbis, as well as personal issues such as why Rabbi Soloveitchik never settled in Israel.

Mythology had become instead a central element in elite culture. If one did not know the stories, one would not understand most of the allusions in the poets and orators, classics and contemporaries alike; nor would one be able to identify the scenes represented on the mosaic floors and wall paintings, or on the silverware at well-appointed homes.<br /><br />Mythology was no longer imbibed in the nursery; nor could it be simply picked up from the often oblique allusions in the classics. It had to be learned in school, as illustrated by the extraordinary amount of elementary mythological information in the many surviv¬ing ancient commentaries on the classics, notably Servius, who offers a mythical story for almost every person, place, and even plant Vergil mentions. Commentators used the classics as pegs on which to hang stories they thought their students should know.<br /><br />A surprisingly large number of mytho¬graphic treatises survive from the early empire, and many papyrus fragments from lost works prove that they were in common use. In addition, author Alan Cameron identi¬fies a hitherto unrecognized type of aid to the reading of Greek and Latin classical and clas¬sicizing texts what might be called mytho¬graphic companions to learned poets such as Aratus, Callimachus, Vergil, and Ovid, com¬plete with source references. Much of this book is devoted to an analysis of the importance evidently attached to citing classical sources for mythical stories, the clearest proof that they were now a part of learned culture. So central were these source references that the more unscrupulous faked them, some-times on the grand scale.<br /><br />Excerpt: Despite an extraordinary surge of interest in Greek mythology over the last few decades, there has been no corresponding interest in our sources of information about the myths. Books on mythology have been appearing at an alarming rate in most modern languages, but not a single comprehensive study of the mythographers. Of course, we know many famous episodes in the great mythical sagas direct from the classics (Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, the Attic tragedians), not to mention monuments of archaic and classical art. But any alert reader who has tried to follow up earlier or later stages of even the most familiar stories in a care-fully documented handbook like Timothy Gantz's indispensable Early Greek Myth (1993) must be aware that countless details we take for granted are first men¬tioned not by Homer or Aeschylus or even Callimachus but by some anonymous Roman or even Byzantine hack. Where did they get their information, and how reliable is it?<br /><br />Those who teach Greek mythology in American colleges usually assign their students the Bibliotheca ascribed to Apollodorus, a convenient survey of most of the main stories. It is indeed a handy, well-arranged, comprehensive manual, with many virtues. But what are its credentials? A precise date is out of reach, but it is not likely to be earlier than the first century of our era and might be as late as the third. In the Bibliotheca's defense, critics often confidently assert that it is \\"drawn from excellent sources,\\" a claim based on its frequent direct citation of specific texts from archaic and classical poets and mythographers, citations we can in one or two cases actually verify ourselves. That is to say, the writer gives the appearance of an easy, firsthand familiarity with the entire range of relevant texts. But this is an illusion. In all probability he came by most of his citations at second (or third) hand and had never even seen an original copy of many of the texts he quotes (Ch. V. 3). The same will usually apply to the scholiasts, however much we might like to think that some particular scholion bristling with plausible details and archaic citations was copied directly from one of the great Hellenistic critics working in the library at Alexandria surrounded by books.details and archaic citations was copied directly from one of the great Hellenistic critics working in the library at Alexandria surrounded by books. <br />	2005-03-01

And in this, Jay Prosser tells us, we find the gift of photography.<br /><br />Engaging the photographic reflections of figures as different as Roland Barthes and Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss, Gordon Parks and Elizabeth Bishop, Light in the Dark Room offers a vision of photography as real¬ization of loss-and a revelation of how photographs can shed light on the dark rooms of our lives. The grief this book recalls is poignant yet universal: a son loses his mother; an anthropologist, his culture; a photographer, his youth; a poet, her lover. Among these losses and the remarkable photographs that accompany them, Prosser weaves his own meditations on photography, on the interdependence of loss and enlightenment, on the emergence of our technologized society-and the world we have lost in the process.<br /><br />Excerpt: We treat photographs as if they had a kind of presence. Photography is the commonest way for us to record our own and our loved ones' lives. And we arrange photographs in our rooms of our beloved, often because they cannot be with us there-often (and eventually) because they are dead. Photography is the medium in which we unconsciously encounter the dead. Yet herein lies photography's hidden truth. Photographs are not signs of presence but evidence of absence. Or rather the presence of a photo-graph indicates its subject's absence. Photographs contain a realization of loss. This book on photography enters into that loss.\\"	2005-02-28

Judson, Marsha L. Rozenblit (Austrian and Habsburg Studies: Berghahn Books) The hundred years between the revolutions of 1848 and the population transfers of the mid-twentieth century saw the nationalization of culturally complex societies in East Central Europe. This fact has variously been explained in terms of modernization, state building, and nation-building theories, each of which treats the process of nationalization as something inexorable, a necessary component of modernity. Although more recently social scientists gesture to the contingencies that may shape these larger developments, this structural approach makes scholars far less attentive to the \\"hard work\\" (ideological, political, social) undertaken by individuals and groups at every level of society who tried themselves to build \\"national\\" societies.<br /><br />The essays in this volume make us aware of how complex, multi-dimensional and often contradictory this nationalization process in East Central Europe actually was. The authors document attempts and failures by nationalist politicians, organizations, activists, and regimes from 1848 through 1948 to give East-Central Europeans a strong sense of national self-identification. They remind us that only the use of dictatorial powers in the 20th century could actually transform the fantasy of nationalization into a reality, albeit a brutal one.<br /><br />The essays in this volume originated in papers delivered at a symposium of extraordinary interest held at Columbia University in March 2000, entitled \\"Dilemmas of East Central Europe: Nationalism, Dictatorship, and the Search for Identity.\\" The Harriman Institute and The Department of History of Co¬lumbia University together with the Center for Austrian Studies at the University of Minnesota sponsored this conference, which brought together a gifted group of scholars who are opening new vistas of modern Central and East-Central European history. Pieter M. Judson and Marsha L. Rozenblit organized the sym¬posium, and they made the subsequent selection of papers for this volume, of¬fering suggestions for revisions, and editing the final versions that appear here.<br /><br />The high quality and interest of the Columbia University symposium in March 2000 was a tribute to the Seth Low Professor of History at Columbia, Istv&aacute;n De&aacute;k, who taught all the presenters of papers, either as undergraduate or graduate students. The range and originality of their work testifies not only to the quality of the students drawn to Central and East Central European studies at Columbia in the last several decades but also to the stimulus, inspiration, and scholarly discipline which Professor De&aacute;k has provided during his long career in seminars, lecture courses, and direction of individual research. Professor De&aacute;k has been an extraordinary model and guide both to his students at Columbia and to many scholars elsewhere.<br /><br />All the essays here, in various ways, address the development of popular na¬tionalist loyalties, identities, and politics in Central and East-Central Europe since the eighteenth century. They bear witness to the great changes in historical research on nationalism and popular identities that have taken place in the last two or three decades. Previously, historians tended to study European national identities as the natural and inevitable outgrowth of longstanding popular cultural factors, largely accepting at face value nationalists' claims about the origins of their group identities. In recent years, though, scholars have come to study national loyalties as fundamentally dynamic phenomena that individuals and groups con¬struct under specific historical circumstances, loyalties that can be transformed or exchanged or may be held in ambiguous relationships together with other al¬legiances. The essays in this volume demonstrate richly the imagination and cre¬ativity which historians have brought to bear in developing these new studies of the development of modern nationalist loyalties and solidarities.<br /><br />Much the same imagination and creativity, combined with a healthy skepti¬cism for much of the traditional conventional wisdom in Central and East Cen¬tral European historiography, has characterized the scholarly work as well as the teaching of Istv&aacute;n De&aacute;k. His interests have ranged widely during the course of his long career as an historian. His first book, based on his doctoral dissertation, was Weimar Germany's Left-Wing Intellectuals: A Political History of the Weltb&uuml;hne and Its Circle (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1968). Most recently, he has written on war crimes trials and processes in the twentieth century. Research and teaching on Habsburg Central Europe, however, has occupied most of Professor De&aacute;k's career. Perhaps the most salient quality of his work in this field has been the in-dependence of his perspective-a profoundly thoughtful and informed skepti¬cism that has given him the ability to raise critically important questions which widely held master narratives have excluded. This skepticism has endowed his writings with a distinctive freshness of outlook.<br /><br />Prof. De&aacute;k's independence of view and healthy skepticism were apparent as early as 1967 at the famous conference on the Austro-Hungarian Compromise and its consequences held in Bloomington, Indiana. At that meeting, De&aacute;k pre¬sented a comment for a panel on the dominant nationalities of the Monarchy as integrating and disintegrating factors in the polity. He essentially threw the standard conceptualization of the critical nationality conflicts in the political history of the Monarchy back in the faces of the panelists, suggesting that, ... the subject of this debate is neither justified nor valid.... I would argue that there were no dominant nationalities in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. There were only dominant classes, estates, institutions, interest groups, and professions.<br /><br />Conventional historiography was certainly sensitive to social differences and conflicts in the lands of the old Monarchy, but most older historians essentialized ethnic and national differences and let them cover over other factors.<br /><br />In Istv&aacute;n De&aacute;k's writings on nineteenth century Austria and Hungary which have followed since 1967, he has typically presented fresh, probing perspectives, which have broken through conventional wisdom and long-held nationalist mythologies. This was clearly apparent in his book The Lawful Revolution: Louis Kossuth and the Hungarians, 1848-1849 (New York, 1979), still one of the very finest accounts in any language of the political career of Louis Kossuth and the revolution and warfare of 1848-49 in Hungary.<br /><br />Professor De&aacute;k's other great book on Austro-Hungarian history, Beyond Na¬tionalism: A Social and Political History of the Habsburg Officer Corps, 1848-1918 (New York and Oxford, 1990), was a bold foray in social and administrative history.<br /><br />In this study, he took an unfashionable path in studying one of the major institutions of the Habsburg state. In the army officer corps, he examined one of the most important institutions that worked for a broader unity and engendered some real Habsburg state loyalty and identity. In the process, he also helped re-mind us that there were important state institutions and administrative struc¬tures during the last decades of the Monarchy that continued to function better than many observers would allow and that left important legacies to the succes¬sor states. That so many of Prof. De&aacute;k's students, as represented in this volume, are doing similarly pathbreaking work represents perhaps the strongest evidence of his inspiration and continuing legacy. I am deeply grateful to the editors, Pieter M. Judson and Marsha L. Rozenblit, and to Marion Berghahnand her colleagues at Berghahn Books for bringing this volume to publication.aphy was certainly sensitive to social differences and conflicts in the lands of the old Monarchy, but most older historians essentialized ethnic and national differences and let them cover over other factors. <br />In Istvn Dek's writings on nineteenth century Austria and Hungary which have followed since 1967, he has typically presented fresh, probing perspectives, which have broken through conventional wisdom and long-held nationalist mythologies.

Criminal Anthropology (Criminology Studies)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Anthropology of crime	Criminal Anthropological Writings of Cesare Lombroso Published in the English Language Periodical Literature During the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries with Bibliographic Appendices of Books and Periodical Literature Pertaining to Lombroso and Criminal Anthropology by David M. Horton, Katherine E. Rich, Cesare Lombroso (Criminology Studies: Edwin Mellen Press) Cesare Lombroso, the Italian psychiatrist and criminal anthropologist, is almost universally recognized as the founder of scientific criminology. Since his death in 1909, however, he has often been regarded, as well, as a figure of quite dubious repute - a sloppy researcher, a racist, and - to quote T. S. Eliot's Prufrock, \\"at times the fool.\\" While Lombroso contributed to this poor reputation through occasionally outlandish statements, the negative opinions stem equally from the fact that most readers have had access only to truncated and mutilated translations that badly misrepresent Lombroso's ideas. Today, the pendulum of scholarly opinion is swinging back to a fairer assessment that recognizes Lombroso as not only a key figure in the history of criminology but also one of the most fertile and influential thinkers of late nineteenth century Italy. This book reflects and encourages this process of reassessment.<br /><br />By today's standards, Lombroso's methods may not seem scientifically rigorous. The percentage columns in his statistical tables do not always add to 100; he introduced folk sayings and passages from Dante to make scientific points; and he tended to reach broad conclusions before completing his analysis of a subject. Because those broad conclusions were often sensational - as in his claim to have identified the \\"born\\" criminal, a throwback to a more primitive stage in human development - his work was easy to parody and criticize. But Lombroso's work was also easily misunderstood because non-Italian readers had access only to fragmentary translations. Until 2004, one of Lombroso's two major criminological works, Criminal Woman, had never been translated in its entirety; English-only readers had to rely on The Female Offender, a partial, bowdlerized text of 1895. Lombroso's other major criminological work, Criminal Man, which he had taken through five editions, was available only in excerpts that gave no sense of the development of his thought over time. Mary Gibson and I hope to overcome this and other drawbacks in our forthcoming edition of Criminal Man.<br /><br />For the first time, under one cover, this Lombroso omnibus gives us access to the complete range of literature by and about Lombroso and the development of criminal anthropology - and to fascinating ephemera as well. The material is extremely valuable partly for what it shows about the types of sources from which turn-of-the-century readers in English-speaking countries first learned about Lombroso, and partly because many of his articles published in the English language periodical press have been hitherto unknown to researchers. Moreover, these valuable contributions in the periodical literature demonstrate that late nineteenth and early twentieth-century general readers had a keen interest in Lombroso's work. This work, in sum, is extraordinarily useful not only for what it tells us about criminal anthropology, but also for what it reveals about the dissemination of Lombroso's ideas.<br /><br />A second and equally significant contribution of this omnibus lies in its astounding bibliographies. The compilations exceed in scope and detail anything heretofore attempted, and set a new standard for historical bibliography in criminology. Only those who have spent years struggling to get accurate information on works by and about Lombroso and the Italian school of criminal anthropology can fully appreciate the value of these truly extraordinary bibliographies, which include<br /><br />listings of all of his books in all languages, annotated citations to all of his periodical publications inEnglish, as well as citations to his articles in French and Italian serials; listings of all publications about Lombroso and criminal anthropology; and materials on articles and books about the authors of works on criminal anthropology.<br /><br />These bibliographies provide a solid and broad foundation for the new research on Lombroso and his work.<br /><br />This book makes an exceedingly important contribution to our knowledge of a major figure, and of developments in criminology connected with that figure, whose full significance is only beginning to be realized. This omnibus is unquestionably a classic piece of research not only in the historical development of Lombrosian positivistic criminology, but in archival bibliography as well.citations to his articles in French and Italian serials; listings of all publications about Lombroso and criminal anthropology; and materials on articles and books about the authors of works on criminal anthropology. <br />These bibliographies provide a solid and broad foundation for the new research on Lombroso and his work. <br />This book makes an exceedingly important contribution to our knowledge of a major figure, and of developments in criminology connected with that figure, whose full significance is only beginning to be realized.

As an introduction, it is written in a general tone without much in the way of spe¬cialist terms. The sections are divided into themes, the first being a general outline of the history of economics and how human societies have been seen to adapt to different environments over the past 5 million years. In essence, as Evans-Pritchard (1965) has said about the theories of religion, the history of economic theory also reflects the character and themes of the times in which the theories were cre¬ated. Caldararo provides a basic review of theories of human social evolution, both unilinear and multilinear in scope as well as a historical framework for their appearance. A unilinear view perceives history taking place in a straight line, one simple stage of society developing into a more complex one and so on, from hunters and gatherers through to today's global culture. A multilinear view is more complex. It conceives of all forms of human institutions as being developed forms with rich histories. Some societies developed in some locations in time into more complex ones, oth¬ers did not and some collapsed leaving no progeny. There are many different schemes which have been constructed using both these views and they differ one from the other in their components. Neither of these reviews was meant to be exhaustive surveys of the literature, rather it is hoped they will provide a picture of the development of ideas and approaches to the subjects.<br /><br />A second section provides an in depth study of human exploitation of forests and the use of fire. The main significance of fire here is the fact that fire has been a major tool in human land clearance in the transition from food collection to food production in the Neolithic. Even before this transition, humans used fire to shape the distribution of plants and animals in the environment. A sub-theme will be how forest fires have evolved. Caldararo's argument here is that forest fires as we know them did not exist before the appearance of humans.<br /><br />In this second section Caldararo treats the phenomenon of forest fires as a general instance of human exploitation of environments. Forest fires can be seen as an analogy of the human condition where cultures act as filters for perception and create conceptual<br /><br />landscapes upon which humans act. It seems to me that studying forest fires is quite instructive to a general understanding of the human dilemma. In this exam¬ple, humans have changed the natural world in the process of exploiting resources and by doing so have created an implacable enemy. By introducing the systematic use of fire to extract resources from forests and other wild lands (e.g., increase game, create farmland), by introducing exotic plants or producing fire-adapted flora, and by depleting those animals which lived on the wild biomass, we have produced a landscape adapted to wild fire which never existed before.<br /><br />This process of human produced events, \\"anthropogenic events\\" is the term often used, has converged into a self-perpetuating cycle where wild fire has become a chronic seasonal event, with periodic fires of tremendous damage which are extended and complicated by the growth of suburbs of cities into formerly rural and wild areas. In like manner we have fashioned religious precepts and ideologies upon which our economic lives are founded and have set a course by which the daily lives of billions of people are guided. People are formed within these pre¬cepts and ideologies and their numbers must ever rise to support the economic sys¬tem in which we live. Yet the nature of this course is to inexorably change the foundations on which this course is run, with new commodities, services and espe¬cially experiences - real or imagined - and thus require an unmitigated and con¬stant transformation of lives like the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass. The Red Queen makes the observation to Alice that, \\"...in this place it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\\" In biology, L. van Valen (1973) proposed a similar idea as a principle in evolution regarding the effects of coevolutionary selection. In this view, every improvement in one species will provide it with a selective advantage, and variation will normally lead continu¬ously to increases in fitness in one species or another. Thus to be competitive, each species must be in constant variation to improve fitness relative to other changes in fitness of its competitors. We know, however, from the fossil record that there are long periods of stasis as well as periods of rapid and gradual change. Thus all evolutionary history has not been ruled by the Red Queen.

The Red Queen makes the observation to Alice that, \\"...in this place it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\\" In biology, L. van Valen (1973) proposed a similar idea as a principle in evolution regarding the effects of coevolutionary selection. In this view, every improvement in one species will provide it with a selective advantage, and variation will normally lead continuously to increases in fitness in one species or another. Thus to be competitive, each species must be in constant variation to improve fitness relative to other changes in fitness of its competitors. We know, however, from the fossil record that there are long periods of stasis as well as periods of rapid and gradual change. Thus all evolutionary history has not been ruled by the Red Queen. Of course, in Caldararo's example people have created the conditions of \\"running in place\\" maintained by precept and ideology. Occasionally all controls fail and a massive forest fire results defying all human technology and destroying forest and human industry.

In contemporary international relations the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is a central actor, promoting human rights laws and institutions within countries, speaking out against gross violations of human rights, integrating human rights into efforts for conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, development and humanitarian affairs.<br /><br />The author exercised the functions of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in a turbulent period involving the conflict in Iraq, the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire, and the crisis in Darfur, Sudan. In this unique work he tells the story of the role of the High Commissioner in leadership and advocacy, crisis response, diplomatic initiatives, mainstreaming human rights, and strengthening the Office of High Commissioner. The texts of the principal reports referred to the essays contained in Part One are reproduced in Part Two, offering the reader important insights into the reasoning, the methods and the techniques used in the work of the High Commissioner.<br /><br />This is the first book ever written by a serving High Commissioner in the history of the institution. It is obligatory reading for all students and practitioners of human rights.<br /><br />Excerpt: In a world of convulsions, the international norms on human rights provide a cornerstone for the future world order. Governance must be approached through the lens of human rights. Development, equity, conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacebuilding, and the quest for justice must all take their starting points from the international human rights norms. Unless we anchor the governance of human affairs in international human rights standards, we are bound to lose our way and the world will surely experience further chaos and injustices.<br /><br />In the contemporary world, the mantle of human rights is worn by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. After a career in the United Nations spanning 31 years in the fields of human rights, speech writing and policy planning, peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-building, the author was privileged first to be Deputy United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for five years, and then to perform the functions of High Commissioner for 14 months. While the author has cumulatively spent 20 of his 31 years in the United Nations in the field of human rights and has had fascinating experiences, wearing the mantle of the High Commissioner was the highest calling. One felt a sense of responsibility for upholding human rights globally. One felt the call of the inter-national human rights standards, the call of moral principles, and the need for political sensitivity and wisdom. There was the need to react to fast-breaking situations for the protection of persons at risk. Sometimes one acted behind the scenes.<br /><br />This work presents glimpses into these windows into the mind of a serving High Commissioner: leadership, trouble-shooting and diplomacy. It also illustrates how I sought to develop the role of the Office and to shape a human rights vision through practice. There are two other windows into the mind of the High Commissioner that are also presented: efforts to integrate and mainstream human rights and efforts to administer and strengthen the Office of High Commissioner, now 10 years old.  I was conscious that I would have to set for myself policy goals while attending to structural-managerial issues. On broad policy goals, I wrote for myself in the days preceding my assumption of the position that I would havein view: the rule of law; the strengthening of national protection sys¬tems within countries; protection issues; justice issues; safeguarding human rights in the struggle against terrorism; United Nations reforms in the human rights sector; the role of the Security Council in human rights matters; and backing up the Secretary-General. I would also have to be attentive to human rights initiatives in Africa, Central Asia, Central Africa (where a new UN Centre for Human Rights and Democracy had just been established), and cooperation with regional bodies. Relations with non-governmental organizations would also require attention.<br /><br />On structural-managerial issues, I noted for myself that alongside ef¬forts for United Nations reforms, there was a major report of the United Nations Inspector's office to be implemented; there was need to introduce an integrated contractual regime for different categories of personnel; I would have to steer the launching of the Annual Appeal for voluntary con¬tributions and account for the disposition of the previous year's contribu¬tions ; and I would have to watch over a study by the Joint Inspection Unit on the staffing and management of the Office.<br /><br />On situations to which I would have to be attentive, I listed the follow¬ing so that I could be prepared for them: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Chech¬nya (Russian Federation), Colombia, Cuba, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Guantanamo detainees, Indonesia (Aceh and past involvement in East Timor), Iraq, Laos, Liberia, Myanmar, Nepal, Palestine, Timor Leste, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe. There were others one could add to the list but it was my hunch that I would more than likely be called upon to react to events in these countries.<br /><br />On issues that I might be called upon to react to, I listed the following: the AIDS pandemic, anti-Islamism, anti-Semitism, bio-ethics, poverty, protection challenges, racism, slavery, terrorism, torture, and trafficking in human beings. I would need to have a good fix on the human rights di¬mensions of these issues.<br /><br />The broad policy goals and the structural managerial issues became in¬tertwined into the major leadership thrusts I became involved in and, by the end of my 14 months on the job, I had undertaken a number of initia¬tives and had made over one hundred public speeches to different United Nations organs or public fora which were issued as United Nations press releases. In addition, I had issued some fifty statements on problem situations, mostly in trouble-shooting mode. I also undertook some two dozen diplomatic facilitation actions behind the scenes. This was in addition to the efforts to keep the Office running smoothly. Throughout my tenure, I was without a deputy or other experienced senior official in the front office other than the five branch-chiefs. This meant keeping in the air several leader-ship, trouble-shooting, diplomatic, mainstreaming, and structural-managerial balls at the same time.<br /><br />I sought to seize the initiative from the outset. On leadership and policy issues, I had, by the end of the first two months, defended the interna¬tional definition of torture against attempts to water it down; spoken out against terrorism and the need to safeguard human rights while countering terrorism; supported the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court; supported United Nations special rapporteurs and treaty bodies; advocated a strong human rights role for the Security Council; articulated the human rights role of ECOSOC; laid out policy options for the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights; laid out human rights issues before African Ministers of Human Rights and the NEPAD peer review panel; called for reforms in the functioning of the UN voluntary fund for human rights technical cooperation; pleaded for the human rights of indigenous populations; spoken out againstracism and racial discrimination; advocated changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production which led to the marginalization of women and the increase of poverty; advocated gender mainstreaming; advocated a gender perspective on human rights issues and the consolidation of human rights norms that centralize the gender dimension; spoken out against anti-Islamism and anti-Semitism; highlighted the continuing problems of slavery and slavery-like practices; acted to encourage consideration of human rights cooperation in least-developed countries; pressed for the establishment of clear and enforce-able legal guidelines when UN staff are accused of improprieties while in peace-keeping operations; supported commissions of inquiry for Afghanistan and East Timor; advocated reform of the Commission on Human Rights; called for support from human rights perspectives, of the bicente¬nary of the Haitian revolution; stressed the need for the prevention of human rights violations committed with small arms and light weapons and stressed the overlap between human rights and security issues; supported the Barcelona Forum; acted on human rights reforms in the United Nations; submitted proposals to restructure the Office of High Commis¬sioner; advanced proposals for an integrated contractual regime in the Office of High Commissioner; steered the 2004-2005 budget; called for attention to social discrimination against persons with, or recovering from, leprosy; and initiated examination of the role of human rights in the future of the United Nations (the annual report of the High Commissioner, which I submitted, had this theme). I had thus moved on a range of leadership and policy issues. I continued to do this over the 14 months during which I performed the functions of High Commissioner.<br /><br />On trouble-shooting issues, I had, by the end of the first two months, acted on situations in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Guatemala, Guantanamo, Iraq, Laos, Liberia, Myanmar, Timor Leste, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and terrorist incidents in Russia and Indonesia. I had also sup-ported the Sierra Leone Prosecutor in his indictment of Charles Taylor. I added to this list over the 14 months.<br /><br />On diplomatic initiatives, I had acted to try to save the Bosnia-Herzegovina human rights court; to facilitate the efforts of the Special Repre¬sentative on Cuba; to support the Special Rapporteur on Iraq in his request to visit the country. I had also supported the Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Executions and the Special Representative on Human Rights De-fenders in problems they were having with particular countries. I also acted in exercise of human rights good offices. I wrote a letter to the President of ECOSOC urging that an NGO, Reporters without Borders, not be suspended for protesting against the election of a Libyan Chair of the Commission on Human Rights. I facilitated a meeting in the United Nations on social discrimination against persons suffering, or recovering from, leprosy. I sought to promote human rights issues at the forthcoming World Infor¬mation Summit.<br /><br />The above is a reasonable set of initiatives on leadership and policy, trouble-shooting, and diplomatic facilitation in the first two months. They show that there was need, and opportunity, to seize the initiative from the outset. One weakness that one felt, however, was the difference between a General Assembly-appointed High Commissioner and an Acting High Commissioner. The former can go after violators without fear, while the latter could be challenged at any time - and the authority-base would be weaker. This required a fair amount of finesse in seeking to activate the High Commissioner's voice in the circumstances.<br /><br />Over the course of 14 months I would continue along these courses, as the following pages will show.ficking in human beings.

Esman (Polity Press) (Hardcover)<br /><br />Written by one of the world's leading scholars in the field, this book provides an excellent introduction to ethnic conflict in the contemporary world: In ten concise chapters, Milton Esman explores the origins of ethnic pluralism and analyses the causes and manifestations of conflicts, both peaceful and violent, involving ethnic communities across the globe. He discusses the role of outsider-governments, diasporas, international agencies, and non-government organizations in provoking and managing ethnic conflicts, and appraises methods which have proven effective for their peaceful resolution. The book concludes with a look at the future of ethnic conflict and argues for the need to regulate such conflicts in an increasingly interdependent world.<br /><br />Enriched by a plethora of apt examples drawn from all continents, with end-of-chapter summaries and a glossary of key terms, this textbook is essential reading for all students of politics, international relations and political sociology.<br /><br />The purposes of this book are to help readers appreciate the origins of ethnic conflict, to recognize and account for its many and varied manifestations, and to gain an awareness of alternative approaches to mitigating the intensity of such conflicts and enabling competitive ethnic communities to coexist in peace. Basically, the goal is better understanding of a pervasive and many-faceted global phenomenon.<br /><br />The subject is presented in ten chapters. Chapter 1 lays out the scope of ethnic pluralism and the varieties and complexity of ethnic conflict in the contemporary world. In chapter 2 we define the principal terms and concepts that appear in this book and evaluate the main approaches in the literature to understanding ethnicity, ethnic solidarity, and ethnic conflict. Chapter 3 explores the sources of ethnic pluralism and the processes, peaceful and violent, by which ethnic communities are mobilized to protect and promote their collective interests. Chapter 4 examines the circumstances that precipitate conflict among ethnic communities and the stakes for which they contend. Chapter 5 discusses the various roles that governments play in generating and managing ethnic conflict, and the transnational and international forces that impinge on interethnic encounters. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 describe, analyze, and evaluate the main patterns of interethnic relations, which are domination, power-sharing, and integration. Chapter 9 deals with the various processes by which ethnic conflicts can be managed, with emphasis on the peaceful regulation of disputes. In chapter 10 we project the dynamics of ethnic pluralism into the future and speculate cautiously on what lies ahead.<br /><br />As we go to press, all eyes are on Iraq. Here is the site of some of the world's oldest civilizations, while containing the world's second largest petroleum reserves. Its population of 25 million includes several ethnic communities, of which the most populous are Kurds in the north, Sunni Arabs in the center, and Shia Arabs in the south, the latter the apparent majority. There is considerable suspicion and some hostility between these communities and within their many factions, which greatly complicate the problem of organizing and operating a democratic government. Neighboring Iran promotes the interests of their fellow Shia, while neighbor Turkey frowns on any significant autonomy for Iraqi Kurds, fearing this would stir up their own restive Kurdish minority.<br /><br />Why do Iraqis cling to these separate identities? What do they disagree about and what do they fight over? Why can't they relax and learn to live and let live, to be simply Iraqis and concentrate on making a living, practicing their religious faith, raising their families, and enjoying an abundant life? But if they persist in retaining these separate communal identities, what methods areavailable to help them coexist and settle their differences in peace, rather than endure the horrors visited on other ethnic communities in such places as Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, and Sudan?<br /><br />Basic ideas in the volume include:<br /><br />Ethnic pluralism is not a sufficient condition for ethnic conflict. Ethnic communities have coexisted in peace within the same political space for extended periods of time.<br /><br />Many individuals are deeply attached to their ethnic community; others are more indifferent, able should the opportunity arise to improve their prospects by passing into another community or into a national mainstream. Most ethnic communities survive and evolve over long periods of time, while others pass out of history. Their members are absorbed or assimilated by others or are integrated as individuals into a national mainstream. Fresh circumstances may occasion the emergence and mobilization of new collective identities with their separate cultures and distinctive interests.<br /><br />Mobilization and conflict may ensue (1) when the dignity or honor of an ethnic community is challenged by government or another ethnic community; (2) when its vital interests are believed to be threatened; or (3) when fresh circumstances provide opportunities for ethnic communities to achieve goals that were previously considered to be out of reach.<br /><br />Conflicts between ethnic communities cannot be dismissed as irrational affairs or as misperceptions of reality; they involve differences over real values or interests. Yet, ethnic contestants are capable of inventing or believing rumors about the intentions of their adversaries, of demonizing them, and of committing horrendous atrocities, prolonging the conflict and inhibiting the search for an equitable settlement.<br /><br />Some ethnic grievances are suppressed by the superior power of governments or of dominant ethnic communities. Suppression, however, only intensifies the grievances that may eventually erupt into protest and violence. Others are channeled into political processes where they can be negotiated, accommodated, and compromised, greatly reducing the risk of violence.<br /><br />The main task facing social scientists, and officials of governments and international organizations is to improve the instruments of conflict management by NGOs, governments, and international organizations that can produce timely action to forestall or limit the incidence and costs of interethnic violence.<br /><br />The parties to ethnic conflict espouse contrary views of what would constitute a fair settlement of their dispute. Though mutual distrust, as well as rigid conceptions of their group interest plus extremist factions in their midst, may impede the search for settlement, the resources of diplomacy with assistance from civil society and internationally sanctioned coercive intervention, will play an increasingly active role in nudging the parties to compromise settlements and helping to implement their terms. Like warfare in general, ethnic warfare can be limited and contained, if not completely prevented.<br /><br />Though much remains to be learned, enough is now known about the origins, dynamics, and outcomes of ethnic conflicts to provide observers and participants with useful guidance for conceptualizing and acting in constructive and humane directions. The purpose of this short volume has been to summarize that state of knowledge at the outset of this century.and settle their differences in peace, rather than endure the horrors visited on other ethnic communities in such places as Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, and Sudan? <br />Basic ideas in the volume include:  <br />Ethnic pluralism is not a sufficient condition for ethnic conflict.

This handsomely produced and richly illustrated volume presents a visual history of her work and tracks the development of her signature style.<br /><br />For more than 20 years, April Gornik's ethereal landscapes have combined a devotion to light with the intellectual curiosity to explore and the skill to portray it. Influenced by predecessors both in America and abroad, from the Luminists to Vermeer, Gornik's canvases-panoramic, majestic, richly colored-convey what critic Donald Kuspit calls \\"an original, fresh experience of nature,\\" and what Gornik herself calls \\"an aesthetic fiction:\\" a constructed view of nature addressing the philosophical and aesthetic needs of our time.<br /><br />Haunted by images drawn from dreams and travel, the artist works to assemble compositions surreal in their presence, yet strangely moving in their exceptional spirituality. Using painting to reach what she finds spiritually and psychologically compelling, Gornik works to create an art not only of visual appeal, but one which, as she recounts in the volume's interview with curator Dede Young, engages the mind as well.<br /><br />This monograph is published in conjunction with the exhibition at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York, where Dede Young is the curator of Modern and Contemporary Art. Donald Kuspit is one of America's most distinguished art critics, and the author of several books including Steve Tobin's Natural History.	2005-02-15

Did I envy her! I remember reading All the President's Men and watching the movie in the Netherlands in the mid-seventies, when I was in my teens. I found it electrifying; what an amaz¬ing arrogance of the Nixon administration, what a daring investigation by the Washington Post journalists, what a right and proper outcome of the democratic process. How exhilarating politics could be! I don't re-ally remember whether the book and the movie made me go to univer¬sity to study political science, but I do recall my surprise and frustration in my first year that politics could be made so tiresome. We did not get movies at my Dutch university, but there were lots of readings, endless theorizing, enigmatic statistical logics, and discussion-always more discussion. On only a few occasions did a teacher manage to convey some of the passion and vitality that motivates people to become involved in politics or to study political science. More often I found my-self struggling with the abstract concepts of \\"the state,\\" \\"ideology,\\" and \\"the public sphere.\\" I found out only later that my bewilderment as an eighteen-year-old (Where is this public sphere exactly?) was a running gag among scholars working with the concept. Had they told me then, I may not have ended up with such a love-hate relationship with politics and political science; much of which also had to do, as I understood again much later, with being one of the few women to study this pecu¬liar discipline.<br /><br />After my first disappointing year, I turned away and focused on re-search methodology and media studies. These proved to be much more concrete and fun; apparently I was not cut out for the intense and solemn business of politics and political science. Some two decades later I have managed to shrug off my inevitable sense of failure and turn the issue around. I started to wonder if there was a deficiency in politics and polit¬ical science itself. Perhaps my difficulties with the discipline were not the result of my frivolity but a consequence of how politics and the belonging discipline framed itself. It seemed likely that I was not the only one who was terribly bored; after all, political interest and student numbers seemed to be declining, at least in the late nineties in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Obviously, age, experience, and position enabled me to ask the ques¬tions that I thought were trivial when I was eighteen. This book is the re¬sult. It is meant as an agenda to think about entertaining politics, instead of simply discarding it as irrelevant and dangerous to citizenship and the democratic project.

Can political involvement and participation be fun? Can citizenship be pleasurable? These and similar questions have forced themselves upon us again and again in the past years: they were, for instance, raised by Arnold Schwarzeneg¬ger's election as governor of California. They were implicit in the meet¬ings between U2 lead singer Bono and world leaders, which concerned Third World debts. They were behind the outcry that greeted the pro¬posal, by American cable network FX, to run a televised political popu¬larity contest in the vein of American Idol, with the purpose of selecting presidential candidates. They were inherent in the acclaim for the award-winning television series The West Wing, a fictional portrayal of day-to-day political processes in the White House. They were heightened in thedispute about the portrayal of Ronald and Nancy Reagan in the 2003 tel¬evision series The Reagans, which made CBS decide not to air the show on network television.yal of Ronald and Nancy Reagan in the 2003 television series The Reagans, which made CBS decide not to air the show on network television. <br />	2005-02-15

Richard Piper (Longman) The Major Nation-States in the European Union is a text designed primarily for American students in political science, history, economics, or general social science courses who are eager to learn about the European Union (EU) and the major nation-states that are its members: France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Spain. Unlike most other texts on contemporary Europe, it aims to integrate fully analyses of the European Union with those of its major component states rather than focusing primar¬ily either on the EU or on the nation-states.<br /><br />This book comes into print at a time when the European Union is undergoing major transformations, with a newly proposed consti¬tution under debate and ten new member states having just joined the EU on May 1, 2004, bringing its membership overnight to 25 states from 15. It also comes into print at a time when the transatlantic partnership between Europe and the United States is undergoing new strains, reflected in the recent Iraq War but also present on a variety of worldwide issues includ¬ing global warming, the International Criminal Court, and trade.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of these exciting de¬velopments, this book aims to provide students with an understanding of the historical back-ground, institutions, leaders, and participatorystructures and processes that shape contempo¬rary Europe and its relations with the United States and the rest of the world. The text is or¬ganized into three parts and 16 chapters, with an appendix that highlights active learning possibilities through a European Union simu¬lation. The first part of the book, focused on the European Union, provides an introductory overview (Chapter One), followed by chapters on the historical development (Chapter Two), current institutions and leaders (Chapter Three), and public policies (Chapter Four) of the EU. The second part of the book empha¬sizes the five major nation-states of the pre-2004 European Union: France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain. For each of these nation-states, an initial chapter discusses the development, governmental insti¬tutions, and participatory structures and processes of the country in question; a second chapter on each nation-state emphasizes the relationship between that country and the European Union. The third and final part of the book provides in Chapter Fifteen a com¬parative overview of all 15 states that were members of the EU before 2004, placing the five major states in a broad comparative con-text and enabling readers to gain an under-standing of the importance of the smaller member states of the EU also. Chapter Sixteen emphasizes Poland as the newest major nation-state in the European Union, in the context of discussing the dramatic eastward expansion of the EU and the possible future roles of Turkey and Russia vis-&agrave;-vis the EU. Finally, the ap¬pendix offers suggestions concerning active learning through a simulation of the European Union and its major nation-states.<br /><br />Among the unique features of this book are its readability; its frequent highlighting of quotations to humanize the text, and its \\"People in the EU\\" boxes on prominent Europeans and their contributions. To enhance accessibility for students who may be unfamiliar with certain European or social-science terms, key concepts appear in bold print on first usage and are de-fined clearly in the Glossary beginning on page 384. Each chapter begins with a quotation per¬taining to its main themes, and several key quotations are highlighted to add a human dimension. The \\"People in the EU\\" boxes, accompanied in most cases by pictures, bring home to students the special impact of such European leaders as Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister who presaged a movement toward free markets in both Europe and the United States; Jean-Marie Le Pen, the French nationalist who shook up French and European politics by coming in second in the French presidential elec¬tion of 2003; and Romano Prodi, the former Italian prime minister who became president of the European Commission during a time of unusual turbulence.g in second in the French presidential election of 2003; and Romano Prodi, the former Italian prime minister who became president of the European Commission during a time of unusual turbulence. <br />	2005-02-15

Jones (Communication, Media, and Politics: Rowman & Littlefield) (Hardcover)<br /><br />examines humorous political talk shows on television-Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and Dennis Miller Live. This book challenges the assumption that these shows have dumbed down politics, as well as the idea that television in general is a primary cause of civic disengagement. By investigating the production, content, and audiences for such programming, Jeffrey P. Jones contends that these shows provide important alternatives to traditional elite political and news sources. He shows how these comedic political commentators have revived political humor as an accessible and potent means of political critique in times of postmodern crisis. Bridging the fields of political communication and cultural studies, Entertaining Politics makes the case for how and why popular culture is an increasingly powerful force in shaping our civic culture-and why this may be a positive thing.<br /><br />Excerpt: When I first saw the program Politically Incorrect, I wasn't particularly en¬amored of it. I didn't disdain it like some of my colleagues; I was simply in¬trigued. Now here is something different, I thought, something that is overtly violating the implied rules of televised political talk. Although I never partic¬ularly enjoyed watching the Sunday morning talk shows or the shouting matches of the overly conservative hosts on cable television, they did define the standard. Here, though, was a comedian with a mullet discussing politics with the guy who played Batman on television when I was a kid. Say what? I, like other viewers, initially enjoyed seeing this odd mixture of celebrities from various public venues presented in a different light, hearing what they had to say and marveling at their intelligence, articulateness, or outright stu¬pidity.<br /><br />But, as I watched, what increasingly became clear to me was that this pro-gram was not operating under the same linguistic or epistemological guide-lines that I had come to accept as the normative ideal in discussing politics. Instead, it sounded like political discussions found in most every venue out-side of the institutions of television or the university-shortsighted, ahistori¬cal, laced with the latest media buzz, prone to diverting comments, and gen¬erally dependent on the \\"truths\\" offered by personal experiences. It also was refreshingly honest, impassioned, diverse, stimulating, witty, and smartly commonsensical when push came to shove. Indeed, the prevalence of com¬mon sense as the primary means for thinking through and arguing political issues is what hooked me intellectually. I had previously studied Rush Lim¬baugh and his claim to commonsense thinking in the populist early 1990s, but his talk never seemed very commonsensical to me-it was just mean-spirited bigotry driven by fear.<br /><br />As I began to watch, listen to, and study Politically Incorrect, however, I realized that this program, which had recently moved from cable to network television, was truly something different. Whenever I overheard conversation about the show or mentioned it to people outside the academy, I real¬ized that many of them enjoyed it for the humor, guests, and issues it de-bated. They seemingly didn't entertain the logic used in the dismissals of the show by political elites and cultural critics that this was some unholy mar¬riage of entertainment with politics, primarily because they didn't take it too seriously (which critics always did). At some level, they seemed rhetorically engaged in the conversation it offered as well as generally amused by this televised cocktail party.<br /><br />This book, then, began as a project to study this program in greater detail, including my perceptions of a disjunction between audience appreciation for the show and academic/elite disdain for it. The project, however, changed considerably from its first appearance as a dissertation to include other programming from the same mold-Dennis Miller Live and The Daily Show. What's more, the world also changed during that process, beginning with a presidential impeachment and continuing through to election deba¬cles, horrific terrorist attacks, and stunning foreign policy initiatives. What became clear during this time is that what I call New Political Television-with its biting humor and satire and its honest and commonsensical talk by people not directly linked to the political establishment-has been a central location on television for the interrogation of political issues from a critical perspective. Here I have found voices on television that consistently ques¬tion and ridicule the patronizing lies, twisted logic, and taken-for-granted as¬sumptions of both government and news media in a time of crisis.<br /><br />What follows, then, is an in-depth look at new political talk shows and their audiences, the humorous entertainment talk programming that ap¬peared in the 1990s in the programs Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher, Dennis Miller Live, and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. These shows, I ar¬gue, have challenged normative assumptions about who gets to speak about politics on television, what issues will be covered and in what manner, and how audiences can engage politics on television beyond simply deferring to expert knowledge. Furthermore, they challenge the boundaries between \\"serious\\" and \\"entertaining\\" programming erected in the network era, which increasingly have come to be seen as artificial. Finally, the shows have be-come a primary location for new public rhetors that consistently challenge the policies advanced by political elites and the sense-making on which those policies are founded.<br /><br />In this process, the reader will note that I have attempted to bridge the fields of political communication and cultural studies-theoretically, methodologically, and rhetorically. Political communication and political sci¬ence's interest in civic participation and political norms, values, and cultureare linked here with cultural studies' recognition of culture as a complex process of meaning-making. By my reading, cultural studies has retreated from its early beginnings as a means of interrogating the relationship of cul¬tural production directly to the state. Similarly, political science continues to expend energy focusing on the formal political arena with minimal attention to the cultural factors that often precede political action. The traditional bounded nature of politics (culturally and academically) has transformed into a more porous position in media and culture, and our methods, ap¬proaches, and targets of analysis should reflect those changes.<br /><br />I have attempted to be both expansive and narrow in my analysis, perhaps to the dissatisfaction of readers who are overly committed to one particular approach within these fields of study. Although I discuss Dennis Miller Live and The Daily Show as part of this move toward a hybrid genre of political talk, I have intensified the investigation of Politically Incorrect to examine the specificity of its production decisions, content, and audiences who watched it. And although I examine issues related to civic engagement, the focus is clearly on how this particular slice of television programming is a contributor to our overall political culture. Again, detail and specificity nec¬essarily sacrifice an analysis of a wider range of texts and a wider range of subjects in a book this size.nsiderably from its first appearance as a dissertation to include other programming from the same mold-Dennis Miller Live and The Daily Show.

What makes these documents so fascinating is that these writers were not just telling their young maidens to remain virginal until marriage to their hus¬bands. They were calling for a commitment to life-long virginity, to forgo marriage and children, and to claim Christ as their only husband.<br /><br />Early Christians were constantly thinking and writing about eternity, i.e., escape from this evil world, salvation from sin, etc. The writers of these doc¬uments on virginity were also interested in teleological concerns, and ex¬plained to their readers that there were eternal consequences associated with the decision to commit to a life of virginity. And while scholars have explored various early Christian soteriological paradigms, Virginity as a way of salvation, has not to date been identified as one of those paradigms. However the overwhelming plethora of evidence (epistles, letters, apologies, stories, canon<br /><br />law), irresistible by virtue of its volume, concerning early Christian virginity, both in theology and practice, brought together and analyzed in this book, will cause scholars to reengage the subject of early Christian understandings of salvation.<br /><br />The belief in virginity as a way of salvation cannot be dismissed as just an-other \\"work\\" proscribed by the early church Fathers as a way of earning God's favor. Not only does the practice of virginity give virgins access to God in ways that no other good work does, but virgins, at least by the fourth cen¬tury, seem to have their own salvific powers. They, in fact, are believed to be saviours; sometimes for their communities, and sometimes for their families. The questions of why this happened when this happened has not yet been thoroughly examined. It is interesting to note, however, that this growing el¬evation of the powers of virgins coincides with the rise of the status of \\"ever virgin Mary.\\" It also coincides with the \\"conversion\\" to Christianity of hun¬dreds of thousands of people in the Roman Empire; many of whom may have had female saviours in their pantheon of gods.<br /><br />It is hoped, then, that this book will cause other scholars and students of history to recognize the interest in human sexuality that often occupied the in¬terests of many of the early Christian leaders, and how it was believed that a persons sexual history could very well either haunt or bless the believer throughout eternity.e of the status of \\"ever virgin Mary.\\" It also coincides with the \\"conversion\\" to Christianity of hundreds of thousands of people in the Roman Empire; many of whom may have had female saviours in their pantheon of gods. <br />It is hoped, then, that this book will cause other scholars and students of history to recognize the interest in human sexuality that often occupied the interests of many of the early Christian leaders, and how it was believed that a persons sexual history could very well either haunt or bless the believer throughout eternity. <br />	2005-02-14

This group of mainly Lebanese Shiite Muslims gained both infamy and fame by its pragmatic use of both militant and moderate tactics in pursuit of its goals. Hizbullah's oscillation between these two extremes has left most scholars and policymakers perplexed.<br /><br />This book serves as a road map for under-standing not only Hizbullah but also other Islamist groups and their challenges to contem¬porary politics. Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh examines the Hizbullah of Lebanon through a structural analysis using original and archival sources. Employing a theoretical framework drawing on a broad range of studies on crisis conditions, lead¬ership, political parties, and guerrilla warfare, In the Path of Hizbullah stands alone in its qualita¬tive and quantitative exploration of one of the most complex contemporary Islamist organizations and offers a thoughtful perspective on the party's future.<br /><br />Excerpt: This book has been an unhurried project. Its origin dates back to six years ago when I decided to write a book on Hizbullah. For a long time, I have been researching and writing on Lebanon's Islamist movements, in partic¬ular Hizbullah. I intended neither to write a book that serves as a medium for academic promotion, nor to treat Hizbullah's phenomena from a jour¬nalistic perspective. Four years and four drafts later, the present work is the result of my efforts.<br /><br />One reason it took so long to write this book is that I spent a lot of time working out a conceptual model to lean on and to guide the analysis. The book fills what I believe to be an important gap in the literature. Although there are some books on Hizbullah, almost none draw heavily, as I do, on the sophisticated organizational structure and functions of this Islamic group. Moreover, I have tried to write this book as a mode of inquiry, intel¬ligible to any literate person interested in the subject. My aim has been to be reasonably clear without being simplistic, and to be somewhat original without being merely idiosyncratic. I believe that the result, though slow in coming, is unique.<br /><br />Studying one of the most complex organizations of all Islamist move¬ments in terms of structures and functions, rather than ideology, has allowed me to develop a conceptual framework of crises and responses that are solidly based on widely accepted theories. The conceptual framework specifies linkages between crisis conditions and responses in terms of ide¬ology, organizational structures, and modes of action. I found it hard to understand Islamist movements, Hizbullah or others, without the aid of conceptual touchstones found in the traditions of Islamic theology, history, and writings of the group's ideologues or fountainheads.te this book as a mode of inquiry, intelligible to any literate person interested in the subject.

Suzanne Donovan, John D. Bransford (National Academies Press) This book has its roots in the report of the Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience and School (National Research Council, 1999, National Academy Press). That report presented an illuminating review of research in a variety of fields that has advanced understanding of human learning. The report also made an important attempt to draw from that body of knowledge implications for teaching. A follow-on study by a second committee explored what research and development would need to be done, and how it would need to be communicated, to be especially useful to teachers, principals, superinten¬dents, and policy makers: How People Learn: Bridging Research and Prac¬tice (National Research Council, 1999). These two individual reports were combined to produce an expanded edition of How People Learn (National Research Council, 2000). We refer to this volume as HPL.<br /><br />In the present book, the goal is to take the HPL work to the next step: to provide examples of how the principles and findings on learning can be used to guide the teaching of a set of topics that commonly appear in the K-12 curriculum. As was the case in the original work (1999), the book focuses on three subject areas: history, mathematics, and science. Each area is treated at three levels: elementary, middle, and high school. Distinguished researchers who have extensive experience in teaching or in partnering with teachers were invited to contribute the chapters. The committee shaped the goals for the volume, and commented-sometimes extensively-on the draft chap¬ters as they were written and revised. The principles of HPL are embedded in each chapter, though there are differences from one chapter to the next in how explicitly they are discussed.<br /><br />Taking this next step to elaborate the HPL principles in context poses a potential problem that we wish to address at the outset. The meaning and relevance of the principles for classroom teaching can be made clearer with specific examples. At the same time, however, many of the specifics of a particular example could be replaced with others that are also consistent with the HPL principles. In looking at a single example, it can be difficult to distinguish what is necessary to effective teaching from what is effective but easily replaced. With this in mind, it is critical that the teaching and learning examples in each chapter be seen as illustrative, not as blueprints for the \\"right\\" way to teach.<br /><br />We can imagine, by analogy, that engineering students will better grasp the relationship between the laws of physics and the construction of effec¬tive supports for a bridge if they see some examples of well-designed bridges, accompanied by explanations for the choices of the critical design features. The challenging engineering task of crossing the entrance of the San Francisco Bay, for example, may bring the relationship between physical laws, physical constraints, and engineering solutions into clear and meaningful focus. But there are some design elements of the Golden Gate Bridge that could be replaced with others that serve the same end, and people may well differ on which among a set of good designs creates the most appealing bridge.<br /><br />To say that the Golden Gate Bridge is a good example of a suspension bridge does not mean it is the only, or the best possible, design for a suspension bridge. If one has many successful suspension bridges to com¬pare, the design features that are required for success, and those that are replaceable, become more apparent. And the requirements that are uniform across contexts, and the requirements that change with context, are more easily revealed.<br /><br />The chapters in this volume highlight different approaches to address¬ing the same fundamental principlesof learning. It would be ideal to be able to provide two or more \\"HPL compatible\\" approaches to teaching the same topic (for example, the study of light in elementary school). However, we cannot provide that level of specific variability in this already lengthy vol¬ume. Nevertheless, we hope that common features across chapters, and the variation in approach among the chapters, are sufficient to provide instruc¬tive insights into the principles laid out in How People Learn.to be able to provide two or more \\"HPL compatible\\" approaches to teaching the same topic (for example, the study of light in elementary school).

The volume text of available books is generally lacking in cov¬ering other very important nonpetroleum-based organic industries such as paints, dyes, edible oils, fats and waxes, soaps and detergents, sugars, fermentation, chemical explosives, and agrochemical industries.<br /><br />This book focuses primarily on the chemical processing of raw materials other than petroleum and hydrocarbons. These materials are usu¬ally converted into useful and profitable products that are, in general, used as consumer goods. The book addresses the needs of both students and practicing chemists and chemical engineers. It is intended to be a primary source of information for the young practicing professionals who wish to broaden their knowledge of the organic process industry as a whole. The book may also serve as a textbook for advanced under-graduate students in industrial chemistry.<br /><br />Chapter 1 describes the development of the chemical industry and its role in welfare and employment around the world. This chapter shows how raw materials are procured and converted to consumer products.<br /><br />Chapter 2 discusses safety aspects in organic industries and methods to protect the workers from hazards such as exposure to dangerous chemicals, heat, pressures, high electric fields, accelerating objects, and other sources of hazards.<br /><br />Chapter 3 deals with the sources of pollution caused by raw materi¬als, products, and wastes in petroleum, petrochemicals, pharmaceuti¬cals, food, and other industries. The growing public concerns over the safety of chemicals in the environment, and the efforts by the govern¬ments and industries for their control, are discussed.<br /><br />Chapter 4 presents the chemistry and technology of edible oil, fat, and wax processing including refining, recovery, crystallization, interesterification, and hydrogenation. The key oxidation reactions of lipids leading to quality deterioration of processed and unprocessed foods, and the mechanism of<br /><br />the action of the antioxidants in improving oxidation stability of foods are discussed.<br /><br />Chapter 5 highlights the soap and detergent industry. The raw materials, important processes of production, and economic importance of the soap and detergent industry are elaborated.<br /><br />Chapter 6 covers one of the most widely distributed and abundant organic chemicals-the sugars. The chemistry of saccharides, historical survey, and world production of sugar are presented. The sugar recov¬ery from the two principal sources-sugar cane and sugar beets-are discussed. The chemistry and uses of nonsugar sweetening agents is also presented.<br /><br />Chapter 7 describes paints, pigments, and industrial coatings. The major paint components, namely, pigments, binders, additives, and solvents are discussed in separate sections. These are followed by the prin¬ciples of formulation, application techniques, durability, and testing of paints.<br /><br />Chapter 8 is devoted to the industrially produced dyes with their clas¬sification, manufacture, properties, and main applications, as well as environmental and health aspects.<br /><br />Chapter 9 presents an overview of modern fermentation processes and their application in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial chemical industries. The social and economic importance of fermentation processes is discussed.<br /><br />The pharmaceutical industry is presented in Chapter 10 as one of the most important sectors of healthcare worldwide. The discovery, the development, and the production of drugs are covered in this chapter. The chapter also includes the correlation between the growth in the worldwide market for pharmaceuticals and the increase of the world population as a result of higher life expectancy and changes in lifestyle.<br /><br />Chapter 11 presentsan overview of the agrochemical industry. Beginning with the introduction and historical background, it leads to the modern trends in agriculture, chemical pest control, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and biological pest control agents. Social and economic aspects of pesticides use are also discussed.<br /><br />Chapter 12 presents the chemistry of explosives. Chemical explosives and propellants are well-covered in this book because of their importance for peaceful uses. They are considered chemical compounds in pure form or mixtures that rapidly produce a large volume of hot gases when properly ignited. The destructive effects of explosives are much more spectacular than their peaceful uses. However, it appears that more explosives have been used by industries for peaceful purposes than in all the wars.<br /><br />Chapter 13 covers the conversion of crude oil into desired products in an economically feasible and environmentally acceptable manner.<br /><br />Descriptions are provided for (1) desalting and dewatering; (2) separation processes, of which distillation is the prime example; (3) conversion processes, of which coking and catalytic cracking are prime examples; and (4) finishing processes, of which hydrotreating to remove sulfur is a prime example. Descriptions of the various petroleum products (from fuel gas to asphalt and coke) are also given.<br /><br />This chapter also includes a description of the petrochemical industry, and the production of the chemicals and compounds in a refinery that are destined for further processing, and used as raw material feedstocks for the fast-growing petrochemical industry.<br /><br />Chapter 14 provides the basic principles of polymer science, and addresses the importance of this subject. This chapter aims to give a broad and unified description of the subject matter-describing the polymerization reactions, structures, properties, and applications of commercially important polymers, including those used as plastics, fibers, and elastomers. This chapter focuses on synthetic polymers because of the great commercial importance of these materials. The chemical reactions by which polymer molecules are synthesized are addressed along with the process conditions that can be used to carry them out. This chapter also discusses topics on degradation, stability, and environmental issues associated with the use of polymers.<br /><br />This book is intended for university and college students who have studied organic chemistry, as well as for scientists and technicians who work in the organic chemical industry, and senior executives and spe¬cialists who wish to broaden their knowledge of the industrial organic processes as whole.n and historical background, it leads to the modern trends in agriculture, chemical pest control, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and biological pest control agents.

In the late autumn, despite the relative failure of the Arnhem operation, the Allied armies were poised to smash the Siegfried Line and invade the Third Reich. The vital port of Antwerp was at long last disgorging supplies. ULTRA was not forecasting any problems. A feeling of complacency persuaded Eisenhower and Montgomery to relax.<br /><br />In the summer of 1944 Adolf Hitler decided to take an incredible gamble. If it had succeeded he would have seized the crucial supply port of Antwerp, and divided and cut off the whole British and Canadian 21st Army Group as well as at least one of the American armies. The end-game could have meant their surrender or at best a second `Dunkirk' and Hitler could have negotiated a peace treaty with the UK and USA, leaving his still very strong armed forces to continue a defensive war against Russia.<br /><br />Out of the blue, Hitler's superbly well concealed Panzer army struck in the Ardennes in mid-December. Thick fog and low cloud prevented air reconnaissance. English-speaking German commandos in captured jeeps created immense panic. The turning point came after ten days of mist, fog and low cloud, when the skies cleared and the avenging Thunderbolts of the Allied air forces inflicted mortal damage on the Panzer armies.<br /><br />This fascinating and well illustrated book tells the story of Hitler's brilliant plan and how close he came to success.<br /><br />The so-called `Battle of the Bulge' was one of the most important battles of the Second World War. It was certainly America's largest and most crucial land battle, at one stage involving half a million men.<br /><br />The Battle of the Bulge: Hitler's Final Gamble tells the story of Hitler's brilliant plan to recapture Antwerp and force a negotiated peace on the Western front, and how close he came to success. Featuring individual stories from the German army and American GIs, as well as a more comprehensive account of the British intervention than seen in previous books on the battle, Patrick Delaforce provides a gripping account of one of the most important battles of the Second World War.tiated peace on the Western front, and how close he came to success.

As will be defined in this book, IT Gover¬nance is the organisational capacity exercised by the Board, executive management and IT management to control the formulation and implementation of IT strategy and in this way ensure the fusion of business and IT. Theoretical models and practices regarding IT Governance will be discussed in the different chapters of this book and attention will be paid to its mechanisms, including IT steering committee structures, Balanced Scorecards, control objectives and management guidelines developed by ISACA, and relational mechanisms such as business/IT job rotation.<br /><br />This book brings together 14 papers on IT Governance written by academics and practitioners from different countries including Belgium, Canada, Finland, Greece, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.<br /><br />The authors of the different chapters have been included in the review process and have reviewed and critiqued the manuscripts of their colleague-authors. I wish to thank the contributors to this book for submitting their chapter(s) and for assisting me in the review process as well.<br /><br />The overall structure of this book follows a logical sequence: introducing the IT Governance frameworks in Section I; reviewing performance management mechanisms in Section II; presenting other IT Governance mechanisms in Section III; and illustrat¬ing how IT Governance can work in practice in Section IV.<br /><br />Section I: IT Governance Frameworks<br /><br />This section introduces the IT Governance concepts and consists of three chap¬ters.<br /><br />Chapter I: Structures, Processes and Relational Mechanisms for IT Governance by Wim Van Grembergen, Steven De Haes and Erik Guldentops respectively from the University of Antwerp, the University of Antwerp Management School (Belgium), and the IT Governance Institute (US), defines the IT Governance concepts and overviews the different IT Governance mechanisms. It records and interprets some important existing theories, models and practices on IT Governance. The chapter is based on relevant academic and professional publications and integrates also the main contribu¬tions of the other chapters in this book.<br /><br />Chapter II: Integration Strategies and Tactics for Information Technology Gov¬ernance by Ryan Peterson from the Instituto de Empresa (Spain) has three objectives. First of all, to describe past developments and current challenges complex organisations are facing governing the IT portfolio of IT applications, IT development, IT operations and IT platforms. Secondly, to discuss how organisations can diagnose and design IT governance architecture for future performance improvement and sustained business growth. Finally, to provide a thorough understanding and holistic picture of effective IT governance practices, and to present a new organising logic for IT governance.<br /><br />Chapter III: An Emerging Strategy for E-Business IT Governance by Nandish Patel from Brunel University (UK) develops a framework for global e-business IT gov¬ernance. This framework is based on fundamental re-directions in global e-business IT governance thinking and it applies to companies that seek to integrate Internet, intranet and World Wide Web technologies into their business activities in some form of an e-business model. The framework explains and elaborates e-business strategies for cop¬ing with emergent organisations and planned aspects of IT. The basic premise of the proposed framework is that organisation, especially virtual organisation, is both planned and emergent, diverging from the dominant premise of central control in IT governance.<br /><br />Section II: Performance Management as IT Governance Mechanism<br /><br />Section II: Performance Management as IT Governance Mechanism reviews IT governance mechanisms including Balanced Scorecards, business-IT alignment matu¬rity assessment models, ROI measurement and technical IT measurements. This part consists of six chapters.<br /><br />Chapter IV: Assessing Business-IT Alignment Maturity by Jerry Luftman from<br /><br />Stevens Institute of Technology (USA) discusses an approach for assessing the maturity of the business-IT alignment. The proposed strategic alignment maturity assessment approach provides a vehicle to evaluate where an organisation is and where it<br /><br />needs to go to attain and sustain business-IT alignment. The careful assessment of a<br /><br />firm's alignment maturity is an important step in identifying the specific actions necessary to ensure IT is being used to appropriately enable or drive the business strategy.<br /><br />Chapter V: Linking the IT Balanced Scorecard to the Business Objectives at a Major Canadian Financial Group by Wim Van Grembergen, Ronald Saull and Steven De Haes respectively from the University of Antwerp (Belgium), Great-West Life, Londen<br /><br />Life, Investors Group (Canada), and the University of Antwerp Management School (Belgium) illustrates how the Balanced Scorecard concepts can be used to support the business-IT fusion. The development and implementation of an IT Balanced Scorecard within this financial group is described and discussed. An IT Balanced Scorecard maturity model is developed and used to determine the maturity level of the scorecard under review. An important conclusion is that an IT Balanced Scorecard must go be¬yond the operational level and must be integrated across the enterprise in order to generate business value. This can be realised through establishing a linkage between the business Balanced Scorecard and different levels of IT scorecards.<br /><br />Chapter VI: Measuring and Managing E-Business Initiatives through the Bal¬anced Scorecard by Wim Van Grembergen and Isabelle Amelinckx both from the Uni¬versity of Antwerp (Belgium), applies the Balanced Scorecard concepts to e-business projects. A generic e-business scorecard is developed and presented as a measuring and management instrument. The proposed e-business scorecard consists of four per¬spectives: the Customer Perspective representing the evaluation of the consumer and business clients, the Operational Perspective focusing on the business and IT processes, the Future Perspective showing the human and technology resources needed to deliver the e-business application, and the Contribution Perspective capturing the e-business benefits. It is argued that a monitoring instrument such as the proposed e-business scorecard is a must when building, implementing and maintaining an e-busi¬ness system because these initiatives are often too technically management and are often initiated without a clear business case.<br /><br />Chapter VII: A View on Knowledge Management: Utilizing a Balanced Scorecard Methodology for Analyzing Knowledge Metrics by Alea Fairchild from Vesalius Col¬lege/Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) (Belgium) addresses the problem of developing measurement models for Knowledge Management metrics and discusses what current Knowledge Management metrics are in use, and examines their sustainability and sound¬ness in assessing knowledge utilisation and retention of generating revenue. The chapter also discusses the use of the Balanced Scorecard approach to determine a business-oriented relationship between strategic Knowledge Management usage and IT strat¬egy and implementation.<br /><br />Chapter VIII: Measuring ROI in E-Commerce Applications: Analysis to Action by Manuel Mogollon and Mahesh Raisinghani respectively from Nortel Networks (US) and the University of Dallas (USA) focuses on measuring the Return on Investment (ROI) as a key element of the IT Governance process. The research in this chapter aims to provide an overview of how to calculate the ROI for e-commerce applications so that this information, and the attached ROI Calculator Tool Template, can be used by organisations to reduce time in preparing the ROI for a project<br /><br />Chapter IX: Technical Issues Related to IT Governance Tactics: Product Metrics, Measurements and Process Control by Michalis Xenos from the Hellenic Open Univer¬sity (Greece) deals with some technical aspects of the strategies for IT Governance and aims at introducing the reader to software metrics that are used to provide knowledge about different elements of IT projects. Internal metrics are presented that can be applied prior to the release of IT products to provide indications relating to quality characteristics, and external metrics are introduced that can be applied after IT product delivery to give information about user perception of product quality. The chapter also analyzes the correlation between internal and external metrics and discusses how these metrics can be combined in a measurement program.<br /><br />Section III: Other IT Governance Mechanisms<br /><br />Section III: Other IT Governance Mechanisms describes other mechanisms in¬cluding roles and responsibilities within the IT organisation, the control objectives and management guidelines of COBIT, and the IT outsourcing solution. This part consists of three chapters.<br /><br />Chapter X: Managing IT Functions by Petter Gottschalk from the Norwegian School of Management (Norway) discusses imperatives for IT functions, organisation of IT functions, roles of IT functions, roles of chief information officers (CIOs) and key issues in IT management. A survey conducted in Norway revealed that CIOs find the role of entrepreneur most important and the role of liaison least important. This survey also revealed that \\"Improving links between information systems strategy and busi¬ness strategy\\" was ranked as most important key issue in IT management in Norway.<br /><br />Chapter XI: Governing Information Technology through COBIT by Erik Guldentops from the IT Governance Institute (USA) reviews the COBIT framework that incorporates material on IT Governance. COBIT presents an international and generally accepted IT control framework enabling organisations to implement an IT Governance structure throughout the enterprise. Its management guidelines component consists of maturity models, critical success factors, key goal indicators and key performance indi¬cators for 34 identified IT processes. This structure delivers a significantly improved framework responding for management's need for control and measurability of IT by providing means to assess and measure the organisation's IT environment against COBIT's IT processes.<br /><br />Chapter XII: Governance in IT Outsourcing Partnerships by Erik Beulen from Tilburg University (The Netherlands) is based on 11 international IT outsourcing part¬nerships, five expert interviews and on literature. Three dimensions are described in a descriptive IT outsourcing partnership governance framework: the outsourcing organisation, the maintenance of the relationship, and the IT supplier. In this frame-work, 11 governance factors are defined including the existence of a clear IT strategy at the outsourcing organisation, a mutual trust between the outsourcing organisation and the IT supplier, and an adequate contract and account management. Furthermore, the chapter focuses on the IT outsourcing contract.<br /><br />Section IV: IT Governance in Action<br /><br />Section IV: IT Governance in Action describes the application of IT Governance structures in respectively an enterprise and in the health care industry. Section IV includes two chapters.<br /><br />Chapter XIII: The Evolution of IT Governance at NB Power by Joanne Callahan, Cassio Bastos and Dwayne Keyes, from New Brunswick Power Corporation (Canada) describes the IT Governance framework that NB Power has implemented. Through IT Governance the organisation was able to addressthe results of a diagnostic study on their internal IT service provider who was attempting to respond to a seemingly end-less list of requests for IT support. Now, after four years, factors critical to the success of implementing an IT Governance framework are evident. The IT Governance frame-work is still evolving, but the organisation is now well positioned to take advantage of its IT investment.<br /><br />Chapter XIV: Governance Structures for IT in the Health Care Industry by Reima Suomi and Jarmo T&auml;hk&auml;p&auml;&auml; from the Turku School of Economics and Business Administration (Finland) discusses the role of IT in the health care industry and focuses on the question of which governance structures are best for managing IT within this industry. Two Finnish cases are described - a small health care federation of munici¬palities and a medium-sized health care unit - to illustrate internal and external gover¬nance structures. It is shown that internal governance structures such as developing a comprehensive business strategy are essential parts of IT Governance and that outsourcing activities suggest that there is a need for developing and managing exter¬nal governance structures., can be used by organisations to reduce time in preparing the ROI for a project <br />Chapter IX: Technical Issues Related to IT Governance Tactics: Product Metrics, Measurements and Process Control by Michalis Xenos from the Hellenic Open University (Greece) deals with some technical aspects of the strategies for IT Governance and aims at introducing the reader to software metrics that are used to provide knowledge about different elements of IT projects.

Operation Sealion, 1940 by Martin Marix Evans (Longman) It's the summer of 1940 and the Nazis have crossed the English Channel to invade Britain. They advance north from the south coast and great swathes of southern England come under German control.<br /><br />Fiction, of course, but an invasion of Britain was planned by Hitler to take place in the summer of 1940 - how far would the Germans have been able to advance? Would they have been successful?<br /><br />The Battle of Britain was launched in July 1940, first against fighter airfields, and later, from 1 September, against London. On 16 July Hitler issued Fuhrer Directive No. 16 for preparations for a landing operation against England. Operation Sealion (as the landing was called) was then postponed on 17 September and cancelled on 12 October. This book explores the alternative scenario - that Sealion began as planned on 21 September.<br /><br />Invasion! Operation Sealion 1940 follows the historical course of events up to 1 September, including the planning in Britain and Germany, and the aerial war. The British strategy for defending England is that actually adopted by General Alan Brooke when appointed to Southern Command on 26 June. In the second part of the book, Martin Marix Evans provides a fictional account of the invasion. This is based on detailed study of German geological and geographical analysis of the English terrain and the maps and handbooks that were published to convey this data to their commanders in the field. It is also founded on the Defence of Britain Project - a massive survey of 20th-century installations such as pill-boxes, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters and anti-tank ditches, whilst the behaviour of German troops is firmly based on actual events in Europe earlier in 1940.<br /><br />In the summer of 1940 Britain stood almost alone, supported only by the Commonwealth countries, against the threat of German world domination. In the skies the Battle of Britain raged while frantic preparations were being made to resist what seemed inevitable - the landing of German forces on English shores. In Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands equally vigorous work was in hand to prepare for the invasion that was called Operation Sealion. Special underwater tanks were invented to land on British beaches, fast assault craft were designed to rush shock troops ashore and pontoon-mounted gun batteries were devised to protect the fleet of ships and barges that would carry two German armies and 250 tanks across the Channel. And then the Luftwaffe turned from assaults on RAF airfields to bombing London, a decision that cost them victory in the air - but what if that error had not been made?<br /><br />If Operation Sealion had begun in September 1940, would the Royal Navy have thwarted Hitler's aims? Would the RAF have been able to prevent another blitzkrieg offensive like the one that shattered France? Would the remnants of the army that had been plucked from Dunkirk's beaches have been able to resist the Panzers?<br /><br />The answers to these questions are worked out in Invasion! Operation Sealion 1940. The book draws on German and British archives and on modern research to construct a scenario both dramatic and realistic, illustrating what it takes to succeed in landing on hostile shores.e frantic preparations were being made to resist what seemed inevitable - the landing of German forces on English shores.

However Lange's Handbook is the essential tool for any working chemist.<br /><br />Excerpt: This new edition, the fifth under the aegis of the present editor, remains the one-volume source of factual information for chemists, both professionals and students-the first place in which to \\"look it up\\" on the spot. The aim is to provide sufficient data to satisfy all one's general needs without recourse to other reference sources. A user will find this volume of value as a time-saver because of the many tables of numerical data that have been especially compiled.<br /><br />Descriptive properties for a basic group of approximately 4300 organic compounds are compiled in Section 1, an increase of 300 entries. All entries are listed alphabetically according to the senior prefix of the name. The data for each organic compound include (where available) name, structural formula, formula weight, Beilstein reference (or if un- available, the entry to the Merck Index, 12th ed.), density, refractive index, melting point, boiling point, flash point, and solubility (citing numerical values if known) in water and various common organic solvents. Structural formulas either too com¬plex or too ambiguous to be rendered as line formulas are grouped at the bottom of each facing dou¬ble page on which the entries appear. Alternative names, as well as trivial names of long-standing usage, are listed in their respective alphabetical order at the bottom of each double page in the regular alphabetical sequence. Another feature that assists the user in locating a desired entry is the empirical formula index.<br /><br />Section 2 on General Information, Conversion Tables, and Mathematics has had the table on general conversion factors thoroughly reworked. Similarly the material on Statistics in Chemical Analysis has had its contents more than doubled.<br /><br />Descriptive properties for a basic group of inorganic compounds are compiled in Section 3, which has undergone a small increase in the number of entries. Many entries under the column \\"Solubility\\" supply the reader with precise quantities dissolved in a stated solvent and at a given temperature. Several portions of Section 4, Properties of Atoms, Radicals, and Bonds, have been significantly enlarged. For example, the entries under \\"Ionization Energy of Molecular and Radical Species\\" now number 740 and have an additional column with the enthalpy of formation of the ions. Likewise, the table on \\"Electron Affinities of the Elements, Molecules, and Radicals\\" now contains about 225 entries. The Table of Nuclides has material on additional radionuclides, their radiations, and the neu¬tron capture cross sections.<br /><br />Revised material for Section 5 includes the material on surface tension, viscosity, dielectric con¬stant, and dipole moment for organic compounds. In order to include more data at several tempera¬tures, the material has been divided into two separate tables. Material on surface tension and viscosity constitute the first table with 715 entries; included is the temperature range of the liquid phase. Material on dielectric constant and dipole moment constitute another table of 1220 entries. The additional data at two or more temperatures permit interpolation for intermediate temperatures and also permit limited extrapolation of the data. The Properties of Combustible Mixtures in Air has been revised and expanded to include over 450 compounds. Flash points are to be found in Section 1. Completely revised are the tables on Thermal Conductivity for gases, liquids, and solids. Van der Waals' constants for gases have been brought up to date and expanded to over 500 substances.<br /><br />Section 6, which includes Enthalpies and Gibbs Energies of Formation, Entropies, and Heat Capacities of Organic and Inorganic Compounds, and Heats of Melting, Vaporization, and Sublimation and Specific Heat at Various Temperatures for organic and inorganic compounds, has expanded by<br /><br />11 pages, but the major additions have involved data in columns where it previously was absent. More material has also been included for critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume.<br /><br />The section on Spectroscopy has been retained but with some revisions and expansion. The section includes ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray spectrometry. Detection limits are listed for the elements when using flame emission, flame atomic absorption, electrothermal atomic absorption, argon induction coupled plasma, and flame atomic fluorescence. Nuclear magnetic resonance embraces tables for the nuclear properties of the elements, proton chemical shifts and coupling constants, and similar material for carbon-13, boron-11, nitrogen-15, fluorine-19, silicon-29, and phosphorus-31.<br /><br />In Section 8, the material on solubility constants has been doubled to 550 entries. Sections on proton transfer reactions, including some at various temperatures, formation constants of metal com¬plexes with organic and inorganic ligands, buffer solutions of all types, reference electrodes, indicators, and electrode potentials are retained with some revisions. The material on conductance has been revised and expanded, particularly in the table on limiting equivalent ionic conductance.<br /><br />Everything in Sections 9 and 10 on physiochemical relationships, and on polymers, rubbers, fats, oils, and waxes, respectively, has been retained.<br /><br />Section 11, Practical Laboratory Information, has undergone significant changes and expansion. Entries in the table on \\"Molecular Elevation of the Boiling Point\\" have been increased. McReynolds' constants for stationary phases in gas chromatography have been reorganized and expanded. The guide to ion-exchange resins and discussion is new and embraces all types of column packing and membrane materials. Gravimetric factors have been altered to reflect the changes in atomic weights for several elements. Newly added are tables listing elements precipitated by general analytical reagents, and giving equations for the redox determination of the elements with their equivalent weights. Discussion on the topics of precipitation and complexometric titration include primary standards and indicators for each analytical technique. A new topic of masking and demasking agents includes discussion and tables of masking agents for various elements, for anions and neutral molecules, and common demasking agents. A table has been added listing the common amino acids with their pI and pKa values and their 3-letter and I-letter abbreviations. Lastly a 9-page table lists the threshold limit value (TL V) for gases and vapors.c compounds, has expanded by <br />11 pages, but the major additions have involved data in columns where it previously was absent. More material has also been included for critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume. <br />The section on Spectroscopy has been retained but with some revisions and expansion. The section includes ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray spectrometry. Detection limits are listed for the elements when using flame emission, flame atomic absorption, electrothermal atomic absorption, argon induction coupled plasma, and flame atomic fluorescence.

Although this volume aims to develop and give a name to a budding field of inquiry, the chapters in Part I are devoted to researchers who have been working in this area all along.<br /><br />Chapter 2, by Herb Clark and Adrian Bangerter, provides both a historical and a contemporary perspective on reference, which is the ubiquitous activity involved in picking out an object for an addressee. Consider the utterance Put the small coffee cup over there. One would have to pick out the cup (presumably from among other candidate objects) and know where over there is (presumably from a gesture). Their chapter describes how reference was initially viewed as autonomous and addressee-blind before it came to be viewed as an activity that requires the coordination of both speaker and addressee. Among the features of referring highlighted are: (a) the multiple methods of directing an addressee's attention to individual objects; and (b) speaker-addressee pacts to arrive at a reference (i.e., to agree to certain provisional names). The coordination involved in referring is extensive, Clark and Bangerter argue, leading them to conclude that it is far from being an autonomous act. In fact, it requires more than mere coordination, it is an act that requires the full participation of both initiator and addressee. The chapter highlights how armchair reflection, field observations and careful experimentation have combined to lead to a more profound understanding of this fundamental communicative act. The chapter also provides an opportunity to appreciate Clark's well-known contributions to discourse analysis (the Given-New contract, common ground) in the context of pragmatic theory-making.<br /><br />For more than 20 years, Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., has embodied the aim of this book, by specifically testing linguistic-pragmatic theories using experimental psychological methods. In Chapter 3, Gibbs describes how his experiments have constrained theories with respect to four areas that are at the heart of linguistic-pragmatics: making and understanding promises, under-standing definite descriptions, making and interpreting indirect speech acts, and the distinction between what is said and what is meant. In each case, he has - like most accomplished experimentalists - come up with one or more clever designs that, in the end, either elucidate a given theory (e.g., the short-circuited nature of indirect requests) or force one to rethink a theory's claims (e.g., Searle's speech act theory with respect to promises). The aim of Gibbs's chapter is to convince experimentalists of the value of linguistic-pragmatic theories and to convince linguists of the value of experimentation.<br /><br />Metaphor is a classic pragmatic form whose understanding has been greatly advanced by psycholinguistic investigations. As Sam Glucksberg shows in Chapter 4, metaphor comprehension in psycholinguistics was initially viewed through a Gricean lens, in which the literal interpretation of a metaphor is given priority. According to Grice (or Searle), a metaphor renders an utterance 'defective' and prompts one to look for another meaning. In his chapter, Glucksberg argues that this standard pragmatic model persisted in the literature because its literal-first hypothesis resonates with an approachthat assumes that both semantics and syntax are primary while pragmatics is secondary, an assumption that is common in psycholinguistic circles. Through his and his colleagues' pioneering work on metaphor, Glucksberg demonstrates how metaphorical interpretations of sentences such as Some jobs are jails are carried out as automatically as other linguistic processes. He extends his analysis to other related phenomena (e.g., showing how novel features emerge in conceptual combinations like peeled apples) in order to show just how automatic pragmatic processes are in comprehension tasks. He concludes by suggesting that experimentation is needed to determine the correct division of labour between linguistic decoding and pragmatic inferencing, a central issue in current pragmatic theory. The pragmatic process, as shown by Sam Glucksberg, does not merit its 'stepchild' status; pragmatics is so automatic that it is arguably a module. In Chapter 5, Guy Politzer - who was often a lone voice underlining the importance of linguistic-pragmatics to the field of reasoning - provides a pragmatic analysis of both classic and modern reasoning tasks along with experimental results that stress the importance of the way individual premises, conclusions and task information in general are interpreted. For a notable example, consider Piaget's famous class-inclusion problem, in which children are shown a picture of five daisies and three tulips and then asked, 'Are there more daisies or more flowers?' After presenting a 'microanalysis' of the way the task's demands are interpreted, Politzer shows that young children (5-year-olds) fail to answer correctly (to say flowers) because they interpret 'flowers' to mean flowers-that-are-not-daisies. He also shows how a short series of disambiguating questions prompts even the youngest children to demonstrate their class-inclusion skills. Such microanalyses can be applied equally to many of Kahneman and Tversky's tasks (e.g., the Linda problem and the Engineer-Lawyer problem), Wason's tasks (the 2-4-6 problem and the Selection Task), as well as to individual terms like conditionals and quantifiers. The implications for this approach are clear: one cannot do reasoning work without linguistic-pragmatics.<br /><br />Chapter 6 by Tony Sanford and Linda Moxey reviews their previous work on the psychological processing of quantifier understanding and demonstrates how experimental approaches can inform linguistic-pragmatics. They begin by pointing out that not all quantifiers are alike. A large set of 'non-standard' quantifiers, such as few, many and most, convey much more than a rough notion of quantity or proportions; they have communicative functions as well. For example, polarity plays a determinative role in quantifier interpretation. A negative quantifier like few and a positive quantifier like a few have quite different effects on the interpretation of sentences. Compare few versus a few of the MPs attended the meeting. Few is more likely than A few to place the focus on the complementary set, those MPs who did not show up. Their findings show that the interpretation of quantifiers goes well beyond the semantics of these terms.<br /><br />Current issues in experimental pragmatics<br /><br />The chapters in this section extend both the range of topics one can investigate in Experimental Pragmatics and the techniques one can use. The chapters here cover inter alia disambiguation, metaphor and joke comprehension, promise understanding, the import of saying even-if, and the telling of time. All these topics are addressed using various experimental paradigms from neuropsychology, developmental psychology, reasoning, psycholinguistics and anthropology.<br /><br />In Chapter 7, Jean-Baptiste Van der Henst and Dan Sperber review experiments that test central tenets of Relevance Theory and in particular the cognitive principle of relevance ('human cognition is geared to the maximization of relevance'), and the communicative principle ('every utterance conveys a presumption of its own relevance'). Some of these experiments draw on two standard paradigms in the psychology of reasoning: relational reasoning and the Wason Selection Task. Others investigate the behaviour of people asked the time by a stranger in public places. All involve manipulating separately the two factors of relevance, effect and effort. These experiments illustrate how a pragmatic theory that is precise enough to have testable consequences can put previous experimental research in a novel perspective and can suggest new experimental paradigms.<br /><br />Orna Peleg, Rachel Giora and Ofer Fein give an account of the role of the context in accessing the appropriate meaning of ambiguous terms in sentence comprehension in Chapter 8. They argue against: (a) a modular view which assumes that lexical access to all meanings of a word are automatic and encapsulated only to be refined by an independent non-modular system; and against (b) a direct access view which relies largely on just the context to arrive at a word's intended meaning. Rather, they propose the graded salience hypothesis, which assumes that: (a) more salient meanings are accessed faster from the start; and that (b) context also affects comprehension on-line. Their chapter presents four experiments whose results lend strong support to their claims.<br /><br />In Chapter 9, Seana Coulson provides a review of the way Evoked Response Potentials' (ERP) methods can be applied to language comprehension, with a focus on what this technique has to offer pragmatics. The chapter is instructive in that it describes ERP's various dependent variables (P300, N400, P600 etc.) and the aspects of comprehension with which these measures are associated. Coulson cites studies of pragmatic import - for example, on joke comprehension and metaphor integration - including many that come from Coulson herself. She works from a model that predicts that processing difficulty is related to the extent to which comprehension requires the participant to align and integrate conceptual structure across domains. She goes on to suggest ways in which ERP experiments could be exploited to investigate other linguistic-pragmatic issues, such as prosody and thedistinction between explicatures and implicatures. Overall, her chapter shows very clearly how imaging can be exploited and indicates what one should expect from this technique in the future.<br /><br />In Chapter 10, Josie Bernicot and Virginie Laval focus on children between the ages of 3 and 10 and their developing understanding of promises, based on the theoretical framework of Speech Act Theory (Austin 1962; Searle, 1969, 1979; Searle and Vanderveken, 1985). The authors summarize a programme of research that has been investigating promise comprehension among children from the point of view that language is a communication system and that language competence is the acquisition and use of that system. What counts as a promise? Here the authors present two experiments investigating the extent to which interlocutors' intentions (listener's wishes about the accomplishment of an action) and textual characteristics of utterances (verb tense) play a role in understanding that a promise was made.<br /><br />In Chapter 11, Simon J. Handley and Aidan Feeney develop a psycho-logical account of the way in which people reason with even-if, working in a mental models' framework (Johnson-Laird, 1983). According to the mental model approach, many errors of reasoning arise because people represent only one or a few of all the models of a given set of premises and leave the other models implicit. They then draw their conclusions on the sole basis of the explicitly represented models. Handley and Feeney compare two possible ways in which this partial representation of problems might arise. In one, all models are represented before being pared down by extra-logical, namely pragmatic, factors; in the other, which the authors advocate, initial representations are limited to one model while pragmatic considerations add new models. They present two experiments based on inference making from even-if premises that lend support to their account. They discuss the implications of their work for experimental pragmatics in general.<br /><br />The case of scalar implicatures<br /><br />The chapters in the third section of the book focus on one pragmatic phenomenon, scalar implicature, which is at the heart of ongoing debates in pragmatic theory. As described earlier, there are two main accounts of these inferences. One assumes that such implicatures are automatically associated with the use of a weak term (as exemplified by Levinson, 2000) and the other assumes that the implicature is drawn out effortfully (as exemplified by Relevance Theory). In these chapters, four authors (or groups of authors) present experimental findings that lend support either to Relevance Theory or to some form of the default view.<br /><br />In Chapter 12, Anne Bezuidenhout and Robin Morris first describe how they operationalized the two theoretical accounts into testable pragmatic-processing models. This is less obvious than it might seem because it is hard to do justice to the rich and detailed accounts that have been offered by these rival theories on the topic of scalar implicatures. They then report on two eye-movement experiments that test predictions generated from the models as participants read a series of sentence-pairs such as Some books had colour pictures. In fact all of them did, which is why the teachers liked them. One can determine whether Some in the first sentence readily prompts Not all by investigating potential slowdowns and look-backs when processing the second sentence. They argue that the weight of the evidence favours the Underspecification Account (which is the one inspired by Relevance Theory); however, they argue that their Default Model (the one inspired by a neo-Gricean account) could be modified to accommodate their results.<br /><br />In Chapter 13, Gennaro Chierchia, Maria Theresa Guasti, Andrea Gualmini, Luisa Meroni, Stephen Crain and Francesca Foppolo present a novel account of implicatures based on the Semantic Core Model, which challenges a way of interpreting Grice's proposal that has become dominant in the field. According to the dominant view, one first retrieves the semantics of a whole root sentence and then processes the implicatures associated with it (in a strictly modular way). The Semantic Core Model proposes, instead, that semantic and pragmatic processing take place in tandem. Implicatures are factored in recursively, in parallel with truth conditions. They go on to present experimental evidence from adults and children that support this new model. One of the novel findings from this work demonstrates how particular grammatical contexts predict the non-existence of scalar implicatures.<br /><br />In Chapter 14, Ira A. Noveck reviews the two rival accounts and the processing predictions they engender, before summarizing his laboratory's findings from experiments investigating those logical terms (i.e., might, some, or and and) that could be interpreted either minimally (i.e., with just their linguistically encoded meanings) or as pragmatically enriched. His developmental studies show how children are less likely than adults to pursue pragmatic inferences, leading to a robust experimental effect in which children actually appear more logical than adults. Follow-ups show how task-demands, and not just age, can affect the production of pragmatic inference making, pointing to the important role of context in these paradigms. The adult studies, which include an ERP investigation, primarily explore the time-course of scalar inferences. Whereas participants' pragmatic treatments of underinformative statements (e.g., the time taken to respond False to Some cows are mammals) are very time consuming, True responses are not. Furthermore, time pressure encourages True responses. Noveck presents his findings as support for Relevance Theory.<br /><br />In Chapter 15, Anne Reboul presents a novel task, which she calls Koenig's puzzle, as promising ground for testing between the two rival theories. Imagine that after being handed a glass of wine, a speaker says Better red wine than no white wine. The puzzle consists in determining the speaker's wine preference and inferring what she was actually given. While referring to the two sides of the debate as localists and globalists (for the Default and Relevance accounts, respectively), Reboul describes Koenig's puzzle in detail and proposes a solution to it. Reboul then explains why such sentences may be used to test between the two accounts. Finally, her paper reports two experiments whose results show how implicatures are actually involved in the puzzle. Her results are presented as support for global over local theories for this specific pragmatic phenomenon.<br /><br />How to approach the book<br /><br />The chapters are representative of what we are calling Experimental Pragmatics. Each summarizes previous experimental work or presents original experiments that address topics central to pragmatic theory - metaphor, quantifier interpretation, scalar inference, disambiguation, reference and promise understanding, to name a few. Many of the chapters share common themes, especially the last four, but each can be read and appreciated separately.

Is it simply trying to follow the example of Jesus in our own strength? Is it arrogant for Christians to compare their mission with the incarnating mission of Jesus Christ? Is the idea of God-becoming-flesh sustainable today as a basis for Christian mission?<br /><br />This study is the first to define the meanings attached to incarnational mission across a variety of Christian traditions. It proposes a balanced attitude toward the incarnational approach to mission involving the three dimensions of following Jesus in costly discipleship, conforming to the risen Christ, and cooperating in the universal dynamic of God's self-embodiment.<br /><br />Ross Langmead is Professor of Missiology and Director of the School of World Mission at Whitley College, Australia. He holds a Ph.D. in Theology from the Melbourne College of Divinity, Australia.<br /><br />Incarnational approaches to mission are supported across a variety of Christian traditions. Few take exception to incarnational mission in its most general meaning-somehow embodying the message Christians want to share, just as Jesus embodied the Good News. Brief appeals to an incarnational approach to mission pepper the literature of mission.<br /><br />Incarnational missiology, however, varies dramatically in shape be¬tween Christian traditions. It also comes under theological fire. Is it a form of exemplarism, simply trying to follow Jesus in our own strength? Is it arrogant for Christians to compare their mission with the incarnating mission of Jesus Christ? Going further back, is the doctrine of the incarnation still sustainable as a basis for mission today?<br /><br />So common and yet so seldom examined in any depth, this approach to mission calls for analysis. This study is the first attempt, to my knowledge, to tease out the meanings attached to incarnational mission and to propose a theological framework that overcomes the potential weaknesses of an incarnational approach to mission.<br /><br />The first part (chapters 2 and 3) prepares the ground by making proposals concerning the use of terms, incarnational christology, and a framework for classifying the variety of uses of \\"incarnational mission.\\"<br /><br />A distinction is made between \\"incarnation\\" as a process and \\"the incarnation\\" as an event, but both are considered important in incarnational mission.<br /><br />Most missiologists assume the truth and coherence of the doctrine of the incarnation. Here we go back a step and attempt to show that missiology, in drawing on the incarnation, is on solid ground in making that assumption, despite recent christological controversies. We argue that an incarnational christology is still viable. We defend a view of Jesus Christ as the Word of God incarnate, without, however, using the terms of the Council of Chalcedon in the year 451. We suggest seven requirements for a contemporary incarnational christology, that is, a way of understanding Jesus Christ as God-become-human.<br /><br />In preparation for the survey of various uses of incarnational mission, we suggest three groups of meanings. Incarnational mission can be seen as (1) following Jesus as the pattern for mission, (2) participating in Christ's risen presence as the power for mission, and (3) joining God's cosmic mission of enfleshment in which God's self-embodying dynamic is evident from the beginning of creation.<br /><br />A Critical Survey of Incarnational Missiologies<br /><br />The second part (chapters 4 to 9) is a critical survey of incarnational missiology as it occurs in the missiological literature of a wide variety of selected Christian traditions. Not all traditions are represented, but a majority of them are. They are chosen because incarnational mission figures significantly in their literature. They are grouped very loosely according to the dimension they emphasize most strongly, while recogniz¬ing that other dimensions are also represented in their thinking.<br /><br />The Anabaptist tradition, including both its sixteenth century origins and contemporary Mennonite expression, is considered first (chapter 4). It is followed by radical evangelicalism (chapter 5), which is strongly influenced by the Anabaptist vision. Liberation theology, particularly in its Latin American guise, is examined next (chapter 6). The traditions inthese three chapters tend to emphasize Jesus as the pattern for mission, though other emphases are also found.<br /><br />J&uuml;rgen Moltmann's missiology is considered next because his thought acts as a bridge between the first and third groups (chapter 7). His strong emphasis on participation in Christ best articulates the second group. His distinctive contribution is the reason he is included as an individual whereas the other chapters in the survey are given to Christian traditions.<br /><br />We continue the survey with a third group, including Roman Catholi¬cism and Anglo-Catholicism (chapter 8), the ecumenical movement and Eastern Orthodoxy (chapter 9). In the case of Anglo-Catholicism we look back a hundred years in history because of the significance of the book Lux Mundi. This group tends (roughly speaking) to emphasize the third dimension of incarnational mission, the incarnating dynamic of God.<br /><br />Contours of an Incarnational Missiology<br /><br />The third part of the study (chapters 10 and 11) draws together conclusions from the survey and develops the three-dimensional framework for classifying incarnational mission, arguing that none of the dimensions should be neglected and that they are mutually interpretive. The central argument of the study is that God's embodiment in creation, pre-eminently in Jesus Christ, is the ultimate framework of Christian mission and also the central shaping and empowering factor. Christianity is \\"incarnational\\" ; this adjective refers both to the reality of God's saving action and its manner. Christian mission, similarly, is incarnational in both senses: bodily experiencing a new reality in Christ and sharing it through embodiment as Jesus did.<br /><br />This approach leads to emphases such as \\"self-emptying,\\" integration of words and deeds, the \\"practice of Christ\\" (\\"christopraxis\\" ), Good News to the poor, a theology of the cross, the church as the body of Christ, the presence of Christ, the affirmation of creation, and the importance of the gospel assuming different cultural expressions.<br /><br />The study concludes by commenting on the particular appropriateness of incarnational mission in Australia, which is a skeptical, post-Christian and postmodern society (chapter 11).ons are also represented in their thinking. <br />The Anabaptist tradition, including both its sixteenth century origins and contemporary Mennonite expression, is considered first (chapter 4).

Selections from quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, classical and statistical ther¬modynamics, and kinetics provide most of the book's examples.<br /><br />Features that make learning easier-so you can make the grade<br /><br />The physical chemistry is presented with carefully chosen illustrations so that you can quickly visualize the problem.<br /><br />The introductions to Excel, Visual Basic, Visual Basic for Applications, Mathcad and Mathematica are basic enough for begin¬ners and increase gradually in complexity as you learn.<br /><br />Physical chemistry and Excel are developed in parallel, with regular repetition of lessons from previous examples. Visual Basic is developed with constant emphasis on handling numbers and numerical calculations.<br /><br />All of the physical chemistry examples used with Mathcad and Mathematica are previously used in Excel, so that the three platforms can be compared.<br /><br />Excerpt: Who This Book Is For<br /><br />This book is written for you, the scientists, engineers, and students who do numerical and graphical calculations. It is written for those of you who are open to exploring alternative approaches and widening your computer background. You should already know the basics of computer hardware and software, such as word processors, and a little about Microsoft Windows. You probably have already enjoyed using some kind of spreadsheet.<br /><br />In any case, this book covers the fundamentals from the beginning. Little previous experience is expected for Part I on spreadsheets, and no previous knowledge is required for the remainder of the book. For example, you probably remember from your elementary chemistry courses that an s orbital looks like a circle, a p orbital resembles a dumbbell, and a d orbital is similar to a flower; in this book you will review the chemistry, physics, and mathematics underlying the particular geometries of these orbitals and learn to calculate their graphs.<br /><br />How This Book Is Organized<br /><br />Part I, Spreadsheets, consists of eight chapters that provide examples for doing numerical calculations and graphs with Microsoft Excel, by far the most widely used spreadsheet. These chapters cover thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, statistical thermodynamics, gases, kinetics, statistics, and three-dimensional plots. Part I includes nearly all the physics and physical chemistry used for the application examples in the remainder of the book. The final chapter in Part 1 provides a brief introduction to Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro Pro.<br /><br />Part II, Visual Basic, is a complete primer for the Microsoft Visual Basic (VB) language. Its purpose in this book is twofold; the first purpose is to provide a source book and index for the VB language used in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the subject of Part III of this book. The second purpose is to provide a stand-alone introduction to the VB language, with an emphasis on numerical calculations, something ignored by most books on the VB language. Part II uses the physical chemistry presented in Part I but is otherwise completely independent of other parts of the book. It's not necessary to master VB to use VBA, but it sure is fun.<br /><br />Part III, Visual Basic for Applications, is an introduction to VBA. Chapter 17 and Chapter 18 introduce VBA for Microsoft Word and VBA for Microsoft Excel, respectively. You might not realize it, but VBA is included in many Microsoft applications you may already use and still more in non-Microsoft applications that you may also be using. VBA is thelanguage of macros, those underused utilities that can greatly multiply your application's power and versatility. With few exceptions, Part III uses the physical chemistry background presented in Part I. Part III also uses the VB developed in Part II as a source book and index.<br /><br />Part IV, Mathcad and Mathematica, covers these applications in Chapters 19 and 20, respectively. Both chapters use the physical chemistry presented in Part I but are otherwise independent of other parts of the book. Mathcad and Mathematica are powerful applications not only for numerical calculating and graphing but also for symbolic calculations.ly multiply your application's power and versatility.

This search for cer¬tainty and the crisis that sparked it off is the central subject of this book. First Giaquinto shows mathematical setting of this story to see how the foundational accomplishments grew out of the nineteenth-century quest for clarity and rigor in mathematics.<br />The clarification of basic properties and relations of analysis set the tone for the search for certainity. The objects of analysis-real numbers and more generally points, classes of points, and functions on classes of points-were taken for granted. But in the later decades of the nineteenth century, according to Giaquinto, mathematicians came to feel that an explicit account of real numbers was needed. also an account of the transfinite numbers discovered-or, some would say, invented by Cantor is explored.<br />Giaquinto first explains the two best-known accounts of real numbers. Next, he presents a sketch of the way in which the ideas for the transfinite ordinal and cardinal number systems grew out of the study of classes of points, and the rudiments of those number systems are presented. After which he looks at accounts of the natural numbers.<br />Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the drive for clarity and rigor seemed to be reaching a successful conclusion. Among its fruits were precise accounts of the real and natural numbers, the first general theory of transfinite classes and numbers, and a first account of quantifier logic-no meager harvest. But celebrations had barely begun when certain paradoxes were found in the general theory of classes, which was the basis for all supposedly rigorous accounts of the number systems. This defeat in the hour of triumph made foundational research a major area of concern for mathematicians.<br />Deeper excavation was needed, and the younger mathematicians who took up the task intended to reach bedrock. So the drive to find sure foundations for mathematics issued largely from problems internal to mathematics, together with the conviction that, if certainty is to be found anywhere, it is to be found in mathematics. In this way, the mathematical concern was tied to a philosophical one: how can we be certain that the theorems of mathematics are trustworthy? The bulk this book examines the attempts to meet this challenge.<br />The central concern of this book is the epistemic status of non-finitary mathematics. Epistemology is not the only concern in foundational studies, though it has been dominant. The nature and intrinsic organization of math¬ematics has also been a major concern. Later developments in mathematics show that set theory is not the only basis for this kind of inquiry. Of course, those who think that true mathematics must be constructed will reject not only classical set theory but also the nineteenth-century mathematics out of which it grew. In this regard the development of constructive analysis can be regarded as partial fulfillment of an alternative foundational program. Giaquinto is not able to evaluate the success and significance of this program, and perhaps we are too close to see all of what needs to be seen. For those who accept classical mathematics, category theory has been offered as an alternative to set theory for its catholic reach. Mathematics is definitely not just logic, not just higher-order logic, not just set theory. The old picture of a single fundamental theory to which all else must be reduced has faded. If pure mathematics is the study of abstract structures, set theory is just one framework among others for thinking about that subject matter, and it may not be the best. Universes of sets are themselves structures, and these may be instances of something more general, as is suggested by topos theory. In addition, topos theory sheds new light on the intrinsic organization of mathematics, revealing a surprising unity between apparently disparate fields, topology and algebraic geometry on the one hand, and logic and set theory on the other.<br />The initial impulse for foundational study was the need to clarify our understanding of the continuum and the basis of infinitesimal calculus. The standard set-theoretic account is an explication that has served well - wit¬ness the use made of it in classic textbooks on analysis. But now there are other explications of the basic intuitions. Robinson's non-standard analysis rehabilitated infinitesimals. Non-classical accounts include intuitionistic analysis and Bishop's constructive analysis. The development of synthetic differential geometry gives yet another perspective on the continuum and a novel theory of infinitesimals. Thus we now have a plurality of mathemati¬cal ways of refining and abstracting from what are originally spatial intu¬itions. This too is a way in which foundational study has spread out and away from the monolithic view.<br />If new developments within mathematics advance our understanding of the nature and intrinsic organization of mathematics, epistemological advances are likely to come from developments outside. In the period covered by Giaquinto  in this book, the central epistemological concern has been to justify a body of mathematics. Another concern is to explain how it is possible for an individ¬ual to have mathematical knowledge and understanding. This inquiry needs fine-grained information about how we actually acquire our mathematical beliefs and abilities; then we can investigate how best to evaluate those modes of cognitive growth in epistemic terms. The empirical input must come primarily from cognitive sciences. Investigations of simple numerical abilities have already proved fruitful, aided by a recent confluence of evidence from different sources: experiments on healthy adults, children, and even infants, clinical tests on brain-damaged patients, brain imaging studies, and animal studies.

Healy (Decade of Behavior: American Psychological Association, APA) The study of cognition has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. This topic is fundamental both to the science of psychology and to its applications to real-world problems. Yet there has traditionally been a huge gap between basic research and practice in this area. Experimental Cognitive Psychology and Its Applications aims to bridge this gap by bringing together a group of distinguished experimental psychologists who show how their findings can be applied in daily life.<br /><br />Chapters cover key areas of cognitive psychological research including learning, memory, information processing, discourse, and knowledge representation. The contributors show how basic research in these areas can be applied to mathematical problem solving, task requirements during training, cross-cultural investigations of intelligence, the investigation of recall, and the improvement in educational methods.<br /><br />This volume honors three distinguished faculty members from the University of Colorado at Boulder who have recently retired from teaching at the university: Lyle Boume, Walter Kintsch, and Thomas Landauer. Throughout their careers, these pioneers have done basic research on a wide range of topics in experimental cognitive psychology and have made important contributions to our practical understanding. This book will appeal to experimental psychologists; practitioners involved in training, education, and testing; and students and researchers interested in the core issues of human cognition.<br /><br />The primary purpose of this volume is to bring together contributions by some of the most significant contemporary experimental psychologists working in cognition, including the areas of learning, memory, information processing, discourse, and knowledge representation. They share their perspectives and their recent research findings so that these ideas and results can be integrated for use by practitioners in the field, including those in training, education, and testing. Such integration should also be of value to students and other researchers concerned with the core issues of human cognition.<br /><br />A secondary purpose of this volume is to serve as a triple Festschrift in honor of three distinguished faculty members from the University of Colorado (CU) who are recently retired from teaching at the university: Lyle Bourne, Walter Kintsch, and Thomas Landauer. All three of these individuals through-out their careers have done basic research on a wide range of topics in experi¬mental cognitive psychology. In recent years all three have made important contributions to the understanding of learning, memory, information process¬ing, discourse, and knowledge representation, and findings from these studies have direct practical implications for training, education, and testing. In the case of Lyle Bourne, his research has most recently focused on the long-term retention and transfer of knowledge and skills with applications concerning military and industrial training. In the case of Walter Kintsch, his most recent research has been largely on text comprehension with applications concerning the teaching of reading and writing. Finally, in the case of Thomas Landauer, his recent research has been on the representation of knowledge, with applications concerning educational testing.<br /><br />The primary chapter authors are all eminent contemporary experimental psychologists and theorists in the core areas within cognitive psychology. Each of them has his or her own program of empirical research that, like those of the honorees, has had a significant practical impact on everyday life. Thus, the contributors present summaries of their basic research programs with a focus on the applications of their findings.<br /><br />The study of cognition has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. This topic is fundamental both to the science of psychology and to its applications to real-world problems. However, there has traditionally been a huge gap between the basic research findings in this area and practice in the field. There, thus, remains a crucial need to bridge from the laboratory to the real world.

C. Martyn (Studies in Classics, V. 28L Edwin Mellen Press)<br /><br />Volume one introduces the text and transcribes the manuscripts Latin and Greek text; volume two translates it into English.<br /><br />Rhetoric was at the centre of ancient education, and argument was at the centre of ancient rhetoric. One of the key elements of the theory of argumentation was the concept of `issue' (stasis), which sought to identify the underlying structure of any given dispute - is it, for example, about a matter of fact (did he do it?), or about the classification or evaluation of an agreed fact (should he have done it?). Greek theoreticians in the second century AD gave the theory a new, more systematic structure and developed sophisticated model strategies for handling each issue. Students who had mastered these models would know what kinds of argument would probably be relevant to a dispute of that kind, and also have a good idea of what, in general, would be an effective way of organising those arguments. By the end of the third century, Hermogenes' On Issues had established itself as a standard text in the field, expounded by teachers of rhetoric in innumerable lecture courses and analysed, elaborated and argued over in an ever-growing stream of commentaries. The history of rhetoric in this period is discussed in more detail in Malcolm Heath's Menander: a Rhetor in Context. (Forthcoming)<br /><br />Hermogenes On Issues is not an easy read. The theory he expounds is complex, and the exposition often cryptic. The text bristles with technical terms, many of which had multiple uses. It is not surprising that Renaissance readers turned for assistance to the familiar - and more elegant - rhetorical writings of Cicero. But Cicero learned issue-theory from teachers whose work had been rendered obsolete by two centuries of theoretical innovation when Hermogenes wrote. Hence Johannes Sturm's Latin translation and commentary (1570) presents a disconcerting attempt to conflate two very different approaches.<br /><br />There was another possibility. Hermogenes remained a standard text throughout the Byzantine period, and that ensured the preservation not only of<br /><br />Hermogenes' text, but also of some of the many late antique commentaries. In particular, the Aldine Rhetores Graeci (1508) had included a composite commentary made up of extracts from several commentators of the fourth and fifth centuries - Sopater, Syrianus and Marcellinus were the main, though not the only contributors. The commentators do not provide easy reading, either. They are more expansive than Hermogenes himself, but they wrote for experts, and did so at a time when Hermogenes was a standard text but not yet an unquestioned authority; so their exposition often takes the form of vigorous dissent from his distinctive positions, and they devote much of their attention to complex, and sometimes obscure, debates with their professional peers and predecessors.<br /><br />In choosing to approach rhetoric through Hermogenes, and Hermogenes through his Greek commentators, Nunes set himself and his students a double challenge. There were other Latin versions of Hermogenes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - by Jacobus Tusanus (1545), Johannes Sturm (1570, 1575), and Caspar Laurentius (1614); but these are very rare books, only to be found in a few major research libraries. Indeed, translations into modem languages have also been hard to come by until very recently: a pioneering, but deeply flawed English version by Ray Nadeau appeared in Speech Monographs 31 (1964), 361-421, but the first satisfactory attempts are Malcolm Heath's Hermogenes On Issues (Oxford University Press, 1995) and Michel Patillon's Hermogenes: L'art rh&eacute;torique (Paris, Lausanne: Age d'homme, 1997). But not one of these systematically integratesHermogenes with his Greek commentators, which have never been translated into any other language. The publication and translation of Nunes' lectures opens up a fascinating new perspective on the Renaissance engagement with the ancient world.<br /><br />Rhetoric has recently become a popular topic once again, a discipline taught in most Universities and explored in international conferences and in several new journals, especially in the U.S.A. William Satire's Lend me Your Ears (1992) is a good example of a rhetorical best-seller that has 217 speeches from Demosthenes and Cicero, down to Kissinger, Bush senior and Colin Powell. The 'art of public speaking' was certainly extremely important in Nunes' day, as the worldwide growth in demand for governors, lawyers and preachers matched the rapid growth of his country's empire; but communication remains most important, and not just through the latest telephones, Emails and internets. Speechwriters well trained in rhetoric are also in big demand. In Nunes' day, the normal language of communication was Latin, and his choice of Spanish for his algebra proved disastrous for its sales. Otherwise he wisely translated most of his major scientific works from Portuguese into Latin. But it was his fluency in Greek that was extraordinary at that time in Europe, clearly shown by his Greek poems and his rapid and fluent translations of the Greek originals for his lectures on rhetoric. Certainly no contemporary had such a control of that difficult language.<br /><br />The main problems created by Nunes' black ink pen, by his desire to find the perfect expression, with perfect euphony, and by his unwillingness to slow down his translation of the Greek originals, as he blotted out one or two lines to make a minor change in the word-order, are manifest in the folios of this original manuscript, so many of them covered with ink smudges (as pages were turned over too quickly), and several showing extensive corrections made merely for the sake of euphony. Nunes' ear was highly sensitive to the sound effects and to the rise and fall of the Latin language, and his students must have appreciated his eloquence, nearly always worthy of Demosthenes himself.<br /><br />Nunes' scientific works have long been in print, and recently his Greek and Latin poems, his Portuguese algebra and his private religious thoughts have been published. Now his translation and edition of the works on Issues by Hermogenes and his commentators is available. These works combine to show the great breadth and depth of Nunes' brilliant scholarship that can be augmented by his excellence as a doctor, as a lecturer and tutor, and as a talented cartographer.

Yarnold, Robert C. Soltyslk (American Psychological Association) Optimal Data Analysis: A Guidebook With Software for Windows offers the only statistical analysis paradigm that maximizes (weighted) predictive accuracy. This unique book fully explains this paradigm and includes simple-to-use software that empowers a universe of associated analyses. For any specific sample and exploratory or confirmatory hypothesis, optimal data analysis (ODA) identifies the statistical model that yields maximum predictive accuracy, assesses the exact Type I error rate, and evaluates potential cross-generalizability.<br /><br />No other software can accomplish analyses possible via ODA. The accompanying software offers the following features, among others:<br /><br />* Optimal analogues of traditional statistical procedures such as t-test, chi square, Markov analysis, inter-rater reliability analysis, time-series analysis, single-case analysis, and tine-tuning of traditional multivariable models such as logistic regression analysis or discriminant analysis; multiple sample analysis to circumvent Simpson's paradox;<br /><br />* cross-generalizability (hold-out) or leave-one-out (jackknife) validity analysis;<br /><br />* weighting by prior odds, cost or return, and one- or two-tailed hypothesis testing for any analysis; multidimensional analysis of structure underlying bias in data;<br /><br />* sequentially rejective Bonferroni-type multiple comparisons procedures;<br /><br />* a priori alpha splitting;<br /><br />* hierarchically optimal classification tree analysis.<br /><br />The book provides intuitive examples drawn from disciplines such as psychology, medicine, biology, political science, accounting, economics, education, statistics, finance, psychiatry, biochemistry, public health, geology, and sports. This theoretical approach and statistical software package will prove its usefulness and flexibility for researchers, practitioners and analysts in all quantitative fields, and will become the new standard for accuracy of models derived in statistical analysis.<br /><br />DA-pronounced with a long \\"O\\" sound (\\"oh-dah\\")-is the short way of referring<br /><br />to the \\"optimal data analysis\\" paradigm. This new statistical paradigm is simple to learn, the software is easy to operate, and the findings of ODA analyses have intuitive interpretations. Nonetheless, the paradigm and the software are powerful and rich. This book describes the ODA paradigm and software and demonstrates how to apply ODA in the analysis of data. Everything needed to understand ODA is contained within this book, and all ODA analyses within this book can be accomplished using the accompanying software. Only moments away from jumping directly into the fray, we pause briefly to address four questions frequently asked by beginner and expert alike as they ponder the merits of learn¬ing ODA.<br /><br />ODA is a new statistical paradigm-a quantitative scientific revolution, so to speak. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means is by example.<br /><br />The ordinary least squares (OLS) paradigm maximizes a variance ratio for a given sample, and includes analyses such as t test, correlation, multiple regression analysis, and multivariate analysis of variance. If one wishes to maximize a variance ratio, then the OLS paradigm is required, obviously, because that is what it does. That is, maximizing variance ratios is what the \\"formulas\\" that compute t, F, and r actually accomplish for a given sample.<br /><br />In contrast, the maximum likelihood (ML) paradigm maximizes the value of the likelihood function for a given sample. This paradigm includes analyses such as chi-square, logistic regression analysis, log-linear analysis, and structural equation modeling. If one wishes to maximize the value of the likelihood function, then the ML paradigm is required.<br /><br />In contrast, ODA maximizes the accuracy of a model. As a simple example, imagine we wished to assess whether two groups-Group A and Group B-of independent observations can be discriminated on the basis of their score on a test. ODA identifies the model that uses the test score in a manner such that it discriminates members of A versus B with theoretical maximum possible accuracy. To understand how this is accomplished, recall that the model-any model, every model-can actually physically be used to compute each observation's \\"score\\" via an equation or \\"formula.\\" The resulting score is then considered with respect to the decision criteria of the particular procedure and a prediction is then made on the basis of the model. In the present example, in some instances the model (regardless of the methodology by which it was developed) will predict that an observation is from Group A. Other observations will be predicted to be from Group B. Every time the predicted group membership status of an observation is correct-the same as the actual group member-ship status, a point is scored. An incorrect prediction scores no points. Obviously, the largest number of points that it is possible to attain for a sample of N observations, in theory, is equal to N, the number of observations in Groups A and B that are classified by the model. Clearly, this maximum score is only possible if all observations are correctly predicted to be from A or B by the model. The minimum score possible is obviously zero points, in which case all observations are incorrectly predicted to be from A or B by the model.<br /><br />By definition, an ODA model achieves maximum possible accuracy for a given sample of data, in the sense that no other model that is based on the test score can achieve a superior number of points. All possible alternative models are (explicitly or implicitly) evaluated to literally prove this, which is one reason why ODA is \\"computationally intensive.\\" As OLS maximizes a variance ratio for a given sample of data, and as ML maximizes the value of the likelihood function for a given sample of data, ODA maximizes the accuracy of the model for a given sample of data. Of course, if different observations can be weighted by a different number of points, for example if a \\"natural\\" weighting metric, such as time, weight, or cost is available, then weighted accuracy may be maximized (or cost minimized), as may be desired by the operator.<br /><br />Every type of analysis (i.e., every specific configuration of data, constraints, and hypotheses) that can be conducted in the OLS and ML paradigms can be conducted in the ODA paradigm. The ODA paradigm can conduct many analyses that one simply cannot do using either OLS or ML paradigms. ODA is much more general, and much more encompassing of different data, constraints, and hypothesis configurations, than are the alternative statistical paradigms. The ODA paradigm is, quite literally, \\"new and improved.\\" Using this paradigm, and only using this paradigm, is one able to identify maximally accurate models for a given sample.<br /><br />The ODA paradigm is vastly superior to alternative paradigms. Consider first, conceptual clarity. For every problem analyzed via ODA there is one precise, optimal analysis-a specific given data configuration and hypothesis dictates the exact nature of the ODA model that is appropriate.

Spector, Lynne M. Andersson, Karl Aquino, Julian Barling, Robert A. Baron, Rebecca J. Bennett, Robert J. Bies, Susan M. Burroughs, Stale Einarsen, Robert Folger (American Psychological Association, APA) Counterproductive work behavior encompasses a spectrum of actions that harm employees or organizations. These behaviors include bullying, emotional abuse, revenge, retaliation, mobbing, and aggression. They can range from severe, systematic, abusive bullying to milder, ambiguous episodes of workplace incivility. This volume examines the conditions and events in modem organizations that contribute to counterproductive work behavior, as well as the steps organizations might take to combat it. Authors from both North America and Europe analyze the interplay between the environmental factors of the workplace and the personal characteristics of the individual actors and targets of counterproductive work behavior. While these researchers study various aspects of this topic, the book deftly highlights the connections and distinctions in each of the authors' work. The result is an integrative and comprehensive resource that will help stimulate future research in the field.<br /><br />Excerpt: Since the mid-1990s, there has been an explosion of research interest in behaviors at work that harm employees and organizations. Much of this interest has been stimulated by media attention given to workplace violence, especially that perpetrated by coworkers-for example, shootings within the U.S. Postal Service. Although such violence is quite rare, harmful behavior of lesser severity is commonplace. Research on milder forms has been featured in the national media, where it is often called \\"desk rage.\\" As editors of this volume, we will call the domain of research counterproductive work behavior (CWB), although not all contributors will agree with this umbrella label.<br /><br />There recently has been interest among researchers, managers, consultants, and the general public in the widely reported experiences people have of being recipients of harmful behavior at the hands of supervisors, coworkers, and others. These experiences can range from systematic, openly abusive bullying to milder, ambiguous episodes of incivility.<br /><br />Research concerning counterproductive behavior at work has considered two major classes of factors-individual employee characteristics and characteristics of the workplace. A variety of personality variables, such as conscientiousness, locus of control, narcissism, trait anger and anxiety, and Type A impatience-irritability are among a few of the variables linked to these behaviors. Some researchers have focused on characteristics of the perpetrator, others on the victims, and still others stress the dynamic inter-play between the two. Research has shown that factors related to job stress, including lack of control, excessive workloads, poor relations with coworkers and supervisors, and both intrarole and extrarole (e.g., work-family) conflicts have been linked to harmful behaviors. In addition, fair treatment and workplace justice are important factors.<br /><br />As the domain matures, more emphasis is being placed on the ramifications for individuals and organizations of these kinds of harmful behaviors, as well as approaches to solving the problems they create. This may prove to be the most controversial aspect of counterproductive work behavior research, because opinions vary widely regarding the locus of accountability (e.g., selection approaches versus organizational change) and the gamut of options available and hurdles facing victims of bullying. Our own work has suggested that a focus on employee perceptions of control and emotions can lead to job design and human resource practices that reduce harmful behavior.<br /><br />The relative recency of most CWB research has undoubtedly contributed to a rather disjointed literature, with different camps developing different terminology and looking at somewhat different sides of an overlapping set of behaviors. These phenomena have been variously labeled as aggression, antisocial behavior, deviance, delinquency, revenge, retaliation, and our preference, counterproductive work behavior (from the actor perspective), and abuse, bullying, incivility, and mobbing (from the target perspective). The earliest empirical studies in the area of workplace aggression were published in the mid-1970s (Inkson & Simpson, 1975; Spector, 1975). Other early studies included Hollinger and Clark's (1982) paper on organizational deviance; Matthiesen, Raknes, and Rokkum's (1989) study of workplace bullying; Leymann's (1990) seminal work on mobbing; and Morrill and Thomas's (1992) paper on retaliation at work. Most papers in the area have been published since 2000.<br /><br />The rapid and recent development in parallel of different perspectives has not left sufficient time for integrative work. This issue was noted as one of the most important for the field at an interactive paper session at the 2001 Academy of Management conference in Washington, DC. The session participants found that they were studying overlapping sets of behaviors from somewhat different theoretical perspectives, and tended to focus on distinctions and what is unique in each contribution rather than on connections. A need was felt for substantial integrative work to better tie the work together. Several of the contributors to this book participated in that discussion, which inspired this volume.<br /><br />The chapters in this book have been written by scholars who have adopted different perspectives, perhaps different vocabularies or labels, and who have studied somewhat different sets of possible causes, consequences, or solutions. We have emphasized the desirability of relating, where feasible, each contributor's work to work done from other perspectives. The goal of this volume is to offer an integrative perspective that highlights connections and distinctions among different people's work, as well as a discussion of how conditions-events in modern organizations contribute to CWB and on things organizations might do to combat it.<br /><br />As noted earlier, we have chosen the global term of CWB because it seems to encompass the critical features of the domain without excluding the distinct contributions of the various conceptualizations. It is not the intent of this book to force everyone into taking the same perspective or using the same terminology. Rather, its purpose is to build bridges among the different perspectives, showing where they overlap and where they are different. One of the strengths of CWB research is that there are so many different ideas that are contributing to an understanding of the underlying causes and consequences of the various behaviors that we study.

Shafranske (American Psychological Association) Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy is the first book to critically and coherently survey how spirituality can be incorporated into a range of psychotherapeutic approaches, including psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, interpersonal, transpersonal, and others. Volume editors Len Sperry and Edward P. Shafranske, both well recognized as outstanding scholars, bring together a stellar group of contributors to describe the theoretical and clinical basis for their approaches and to illustrate their clinical application. A uniform structure across chapters and an integrative final chapter allow for easy comparison of the approaches. The volume editors examine current and future issues as well as the legacy of the psychoanalytic and Jungian foundations of spiritually oriented psychotherapy. This volume demonstrates the utility and accessibility of examining the spiritual dimension in therapy. It is likely to become a vital resource for the experienced clinician and the standard text for graduate programs in clinical, counseling, and consulting psychology and clinical social work.<br /><br />Excerpt: Our basic intention in compiling this book was to invite creators or prominent advocates of the best known and regarded spiritually oriented psy¬chotherapeutic approaches to share both the theoretical model on which their approaches were based and compelling case material to illustrate these approaches. Our primary goal was to make this book as reader-friendly as an edited textbook can be. To this end, we charged contributors with present¬ing their approaches in an engaging style and follow a consistent framework to foster the reader's journey within and across chapters. To assist readers in comparing and analyzing the difference among these approaches, we believed that a separate chapter should provide a side-by-side, point-by-point com¬parisons of these major approaches. We also believed that it was important not only to situate the trend toward spiritually oriented psychotherapies in its historical context but also to provide the reader with some sense of the future context, that is, theoretical and clinical developments, opportunities, and challenges. The book consists of three parts that are briefly described here.<br /><br />Part I, \\"Theoretical Foundations,\\" introduces the reader to the basic issues involving the integration of spirituality in psychotherapeutic practice. The first chapter addresses the spiritual dimension and its implications for psychotherapy, and chapters 2 and 3 delineate the foundations of spiritually oriented psychotherapy as they evolved from psychoanalysis and Jungian-archetypal analysis.<br /><br />Part II, \\"Contemporary Approaches,\\" describes and illustrates 10 con-temporary approaches to spiritually oriented psychotherapy: psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, existential-humanistic, interpersonal, transpersonal, experiential focusing, forgiveness, theistic, soul care-spiritual direction, and integrative. The structure of each of the chapters in Part II follows a com¬mon outline. As noted earlier, a common outline structures the description and illustrative case material so that the reader can more easily follow and compare the various approaches. Each approach provides the following theo¬retical information: The historical and theoretical basis of the approach in¬cludes a description of both the historical circumstances and the professional(s) who created to the approach, as well as the main theoretical constructs that undergird it. The nature of the relationship between psycho-therapy and spirituality is then explained and articulated with regard to its clinical implications. The therapist's skills and attributes necessary for effec¬tively utilizing the approach are then discussed. Indicated are the profes¬sional requisites in terms of skills, training, and experience,as well as the personal attributes that a therapist should possess to utilize the approach effectively. Next, the strengths and limitations of the approach are briefly addressed, including theoretical and practical strengths and weaknesses and the appeal of the approach for certain groups of psychologists and therapists.<br /><br />The indications and contraindications for the use of the approach are then addressed-specifically, which diagnostic conditions and spiritual and reli¬gious issues are most appropriate and effectively addressed by this approach, and which are less appropriate. Next, cultural and gender considerations that may affect the therapeutic process are briefly considered, particularly those that might influence therapeutic process and outcome. Finally, future devel¬opments and directions of the approach are briefly noted. These include theo¬retical and research developments, as well as cultural trends, that are antici¬pated to affect the approach in the near future. Some approaches have considerably more empirical support than others, and this is not surprising given that some approaches are relatively new. A revised edition could con¬ceivably update both theoretical and empirical developments.<br /><br />Each approach provides the following clinical information in terms of an extensive case example that illustrates its clinical application: The case begins with client demographics, history, and presenting concern. This section describes relevant client data (i.e., gender, age, religious history and upbringing, current affiliation, spiritual practices, level of devoutness and orthodoxy), relevant client history (i.e., family, social, physical health history), and presenting client problem(s) and concern(s). Next, the relation-ship of therapist and client is discussed. This includes the nature of the thera¬peutic relationship (i.e., the therapist and client as collaborators, the therapist as expert and the client as learner, the therapist as spiritual director and the client as directee, the therapist and client as fellow travelers on the spiritual journey). Because of its importance in the therapeutic process, assessment is then considered. The rationale for assessment are discussed (i.e., how it relates to the basic constructs of the approach, the assessment process and methods, and the type of personality and psychological, diagnostic, and reli¬gious and spiritual history and information collected). This may include a formal spiritual assessment with inquires about the client's spiritual beliefs and spiritual practices or disciplines. Next is the diagnostic and clinical case conceptualization section, which provides a summary of the diagnostic for¬mulation, usually in terms of DSM-IV Axes I and II, as well as a clinical conceptualization or formulation that provides an explanation for how the presenting problem or concern relates, or may relate, to the client's religious background and spiritual factors in the client and his or her context. Then the treatment goals, process, and intervention strategies of the case are noted, indicating specific goals and objectives as well as psychological and spiritual interventions for attaining those goals. This is followed by a timeline of the course of treatment and frequency and duration of sessions. Here the typi¬cal duration of treatment for this approach and the expected frequency and duration of sessions are indicated. Next is a discussion of termination and relapse prevention, which describes indicators for termination and the process of terminating treatment. If relapse prevention is integral to a given approach, it is briefly described in this section. Finally, therapeutic out-<br /><br />comes: immediate and long term are discussed (i.e., the extent to which treatment goals were achieved in this particular case, as well as the client's overall level of spiritual and psychological functioning, at 6 and 12 months following termination).<br /><br />The 10 approaches described in Part II are applicable to the majority of North American and European readers. We are not suggesting that these represent all possible spiritual approaches to psychotherapy, and we recog¬nize that contributing authors have presented case examples that do not rep-resent the full scale of diversity at this time. It would be our intent to include additional and more diverse approaches in a revised edition.<br /><br />Part III, \\"Commentary and Critical Analysis,\\" contains the final two chapters. The first is a comparative analysis that includes a detailed side-by-side comparison of the 10 approaches along with narrative commentary. The second addresses future directions in spiritually oriented psychotherapy and speculates on various theoretical and clinical developments as well as issues such as training, scope of practice, and related ethical and praxis issues.ectee, the therapist and client as fellow travelers on the spiritual journey).

Books	5	0	0	N	N	major work on Renaissance Rhetoric Recovered	Translation and Commentary on the Lectures on Greek Rhetoric by Pedro Nunes (1502-1578): The Art of Public Speaking, Volume 1 by Pedro Nunes, John R. C. Martyn (Studies in Classics, V. 28L Edwin Mellen Press)<br /><br />Volume one introduces the text and transcribes the manuscripts Latin and Greek text; volume two translates it into English.<br /><br />Rhetoric was at the centre of ancient education, and argument was at the centre of ancient rhetoric. One of the key elements of the theory of argumentation was the concept of `issue' (stasis), which sought to identify the underlying structure of any given dispute - is it, for example, about a matter of fact (did he do it?), or about the classification or evaluation of an agreed fact (should he have done it?). Greek theoreticians in the second century AD gave the theory a new, more systematic structure and developed sophisticated model strategies for handling each issue. Students who had mastered these models would know what kinds of argument would probably be relevant to a dispute of that kind, and also have a good idea of what, in general, would be an effective way of organising those arguments. By the end of the third century, Hermogenes' On Issues had established itself as a standard text in the field, expounded by teachers of rhetoric in innumerable lecture courses and analysed, elaborated and argued over in an ever-growing stream of commentaries. The history of rhetoric in this period is discussed in more detail in Malcolm Heath's Menander: a Rhetor in Context. (Forthcoming)<br /><br />Hermogenes On Issues is not an easy read. The theory he expounds is complex, and the exposition often cryptic. The text bristles with technical terms, many of which had multiple uses. It is not surprising that Renaissance readers turned for assistance to the familiar - and more elegant - rhetorical writings of Cicero. But Cicero learned issue-theory from teachers whose work had been rendered obsolete by two centuries of theoretical innovation when Hermogenes wrote. Hence Johannes Sturm's Latin translation and commentary (1570) presents a disconcerting attempt to conflate two very different approaches.<br /><br />There was another possibility. Hermogenes remained a standard text throughout the Byzantine period, and that ensured the preservation not only of<br /><br />Hermogenes' text, but also of some of the many late antique commentaries. In particular, the Aldine Rhetores Graeci (1508) had included a composite commentary made up of extracts from several commentators of the fourth and fifth centuries - Sopater, Syrianus and Marcellinus were the main, though not the only contributors. The commentators do not provide easy reading, either. They are more expansive than Hermogenes himself, but they wrote for experts, and did so at a time when Hermogenes was a standard text but not yet an unquestioned authority; so their exposition often takes the form of vigorous dissent from his distinctive positions, and they devote much of their attention to complex, and sometimes obscure, debates with their professional peers and predecessors.<br /><br />In choosing to approach rhetoric through Hermogenes, and Hermogenes through his Greek commentators, Nunes set himself and his students a double challenge. There were other Latin versions of Hermogenes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - by Jacobus Tusanus (1545), Johannes Sturm (1570, 1575), and Caspar Laurentius (1614); but these are very rare books, only to be found in a few major research libraries. Indeed, translations into modem languages have also been hard to come by until very recently: a pioneering, but deeply flawed English version by Ray Nadeau appeared in Speech Monographs 31 (1964), 361-421, but the first satisfactory attempts are Malcolm Heath's Hermogenes On Issues (Oxford University Press, 1995) and Michel Patillon's Hermogenes: L'art rh&eacute;torique (Paris, Lausanne: Age d'homme, 1997). But not one of these systematically integratesHermogenes with his Greek commentators, which have never been translated into any other language. The publication and translation of Nunes' lectures opens up a fascinating new perspective on the Renaissance engagement with the ancient world.<br /><br />Rhetoric has recently become a popular topic once again, a discipline taught in most Universities and explored in international conferences and in several new journals, especially in the U.S.A. William Satire's Lend me Your Ears (1992) is a good example of a rhetorical best-seller that has 217 speeches from Demosthenes and Cicero, down to Kissinger, Bush senior and Colin Powell. The 'art of public speaking' was certainly extremely important in Nunes' day, as the worldwide growth in demand for governors, lawyers and preachers matched the rapid growth of his country's empire; but communication remains most important, and not just through the latest telephones, Emails and internets. Speechwriters well trained in rhetoric are also in big demand. In Nunes' day, the normal language of communication was Latin, and his choice of Spanish for his algebra proved disastrous for its sales. Otherwise he wisely translated most of his major scientific works from Portuguese into Latin. But it was his fluency in Greek that was extraordinary at that time in Europe, clearly shown by his Greek poems and his rapid and fluent translations of the Greek originals for his lectures on rhetoric. Certainly no contemporary had such a control of that difficult language.<br /><br />The main problems created by Nunes' black ink pen, by his desire to find the perfect expression, with perfect euphony, and by his unwillingness to slow down his translation of the Greek originals, as he blotted out one or two lines to make a minor change in the word-order, are manifest in the folios of this original manuscript, so many of them covered with ink smudges (as pages were turned over too quickly), and several showing extensive corrections made merely for the sake of euphony. Nunes' ear was highly sensitive to the sound effects and to the rise and fall of the Latin language, and his students must have appreciated his eloquence, nearly always worthy of Demosthenes himself.<br /><br />Nunes' scientific works have long been in print, and recently his Greek and Latin poems, his Portuguese algebra and his private religious thoughts have been published. Now his translation and edition of the works on Issues by Hermogenes and his commentators is available. These works combine to show the great breadth and depth of Nunes' brilliant scholarship that can be augmented by his excellence as a doctor, as a lecturer and tutor, and as a talented cartographer. A true humanist, he combined Science with the Arts, Writing with Teaching and Invention with Experimentation, and he excelled in every one of these six disciplines.mmentators, which have never been translated into any other language.

This first volume contains two such papers. The first, by Dr. Gary Macy one of the editors of this series, presents the evidence for the ordination of women in the early Middle Ages. This evidence, however, is set in the larger context of the changing definition of ordination that took place in the twelfth-century.<br /><br />Up until the twelfth-century, the Latin terms, ordo (order), ordinatio (ordination), and ordinare (to ordain) indicated one's role in the church or the society at large and the ritual which celebrated and effected the installment of a person into such a role. Since women as well as men fulfilled important roles in church and society, they were considered be \\"ordained\\" into these positions as much as were men. Thus, a king was said to be \\"ordained\\" when he was crowned king and so was a queen. An abbot was \\"ordained\\" when he was installed as abbot and so was an abbess. A deacon was \\"ordained\\" into the diaconate and so was a deaconess.<br /><br />This changed in the twelfth-century when theologians and canonists began to insist that the only \\"true\\" ordination was an ordination to those roles which served at the altar, that is, the subdiaconate, the diaconate and the presbyterate. Further, only men could serve in these roles. In order to explain the many ancient sources that referred to the ordination of kings, queens, abbots, abbesses and deaconesses, the canonists held that these were merely blessings and not true ordinations. The ancient sources had been sadly inexact in their terminology. These arguments so completely won the day that scholars, such as Fr. Martin, could state that \\"there were, of course, no ordinations of women to Holy Orders during this period.\\" Fr. Martin is referring, as the readers of his paper would certainly understand, to ordination in the sense that it has been used since the twelfth-century. In this sense, true sacramental ordination can only take place when a person is accepted into the orders of subdeacon, deacon, or priest; roles limited from the twelfth-century to males.<br /><br />Dr. Macy's article, which originally appeared in Theological Studies, 61 (September, 2000): 481-507, gives the background to the earlier understanding of ordination and discusses some of the controversy surrounding the change in the definition of ordination which occurred in the twelfth-century. Dr. Macy further makes the point that merely establishing that the church once considered women to be properly and sacramentally ordained in the past does not immediately argue for or against ordaining women in the present. The Christian church has done many things in the past which Christians now would be loath to imitate, for instance, the Crusades or the inquisitions. Of course, Christians in the past have also done many admirable things present Christians might do well to revive. The question of which practices from the past we in the present ought to imitate (and which practices in the present should be abandoned) must be examined carefully and conscientiously and prayerfully based on the best discernment of the Spirit for present circumstances. Dr. Macy's article, then, is included to provide a general introduction to the history of ordination in Christian history that is essential for understanding of the changing role of women's status in Christian ministry and the relationship of such a history for the modern question of the ordination of women.<br /><br />Fr. Martin's learned and detailed study takes up the question of the ordination of women after women had already been excluded from the ordained ministry. Originally published in the Spanish Dominican journal of theology,Fr. Martin's impressive study has until now been extremely difficult for audiences to obtain, particularly in the United States. Fr. Martin presents here an amazing array of sources, proving that there was a continuous interest in the question of why women could not be ordained. In fact, the question was a reoccurring concern of theologians from the thirteenth through the sixteenth-centuries, precisely at a time when women had already been excluded from sacramental ordination. The many authors discussed by Fr. Martin were concerned with giving a reasonable explanation as to why women were so excluded from the ordained ministry since there seemed to be no obvious reason why this should be done. The problem was compounded by the fact that these authors were aware of sources which referred to women as ordained.<br /><br />As Fr. Martin demonstrates, there seems to have been no one consis¬tent reason given for the exclusion of women from ordination and that many of the reasons given by modern Christians for not ordaining women differ from those of the later Middle Ages. Perhaps, the several reasons offered never quite justified the current practice and so had to be con¬stantly refined and reasserted by each new generation of scholars. In any case, Fr. Martin's article provides an invaluable guide to the social, political, and theological background to the centuries-old Christian practice of excluding women from sacramental ordination.ive study has until now been extremely difficult for audiences to obtain, particularly in the United States.

Throughout this book Doob grapples with that question in the setting of the urban mainstream and its varying access to opportunities.<br /><br />The work builds on C. Wright Mills's powerful principle declaring that a synthesis of history and biography manifests the sociological context shaping contemporary life. History, which stretches across time into the present, analyzes macrosociological forces root¬ing people into the social world. The historical material helps explain the book's focus on city life, where the most central of the society's developments and changes have originated. Many Americans, including some sociologists, view historical information skeptically, feeling it bears little clear and significant relationship to current realities and serves mainly as a distraction from all-important recent events. In this book Doob presents segments of histori¬cal data as essential ingredients for grasping modem racial and ethnic groups' life-shaping experiences.<br /><br />The biographical aspect of rootedness examines individuals' involvement in social systems, where one's race or ethnicity can be an important, even critical, factor in deter-mining access to such basic resources as housing, schooling, and jobs, and where location outside the mainstream can be highly depriving. In both the biographical and historical areas, Doob suspects that everyone has a chance to learn about others whose race- or ethnicity-related experiences and opportunities have differed from their own. Throughout the chap¬ters African Americans' consistently oppressive historical and biographical experience receives the most detailed attention.<br /><br />Sociological ideas guide a reader's perception of material. In a textbook some teachers might expect a heavier dose of sociological thought and analysis. However, while still maintaining effective explanation, Doob has presented only those select concepts and perspec¬tives that prove helpful in developing an intimate sense of how racial and ethnic member-ship affect people's lives. This approach has taken me on an exciting, complex journey that has arrived at provocative outcomes.<br /><br />The author seeks to engage the reader in a continuous interplay between conception and activity. With that in mind, he develops a narrative flow, featuring Sociological Illustrations as well as a steady stream of brief encounters and quotations, which weave through each chapter to display a detailed sense of participants' behavior. Such information helps promote an interactive classroom setting.lect concepts and perspectives that prove helpful in developing an intimate sense of how racial and ethnic member-ship affect people's lives.

Their work points to the emergence of a new trend in Muslim interpretation, characterised by direct engagement with the Word of God while embracing intellectual modernity in an increasingly globalised context. The volume situates and evaluates their thought, and assesses responses to it among Muslim and non-Muslim audiences. The ten chapters highlight the diverse arenas in which such intellectuals draw on the Qur'anic text, through their fresh readings of its verses.<br /><br />SUHA TAJI-FAROUKI is Lecturer in Modern Islam, Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, University of Exeter, and Research Associate, Department of Academic Research and Publications, The Institute of Ismaili Studies.<br /><br />Her publications include A Fundamental Quest: Hizb al-Tahrir and the Search for the Islamic Caliphate (1996); Muslim -Jewish Encounters: Intellectual Traditions and<br /><br />Modern Politics (co-edited, 1998); and Islamic Thought in the Twentieth Century (co-edited, I B. Tarus).<br /><br />Like those of the Islamists with which many such appeals to tradition take issue, they can ultimately be interpreted as responses to the ongoing failure in the Muslim world to create a culturally viable, successful modern state. The Islamist reaction to the failure of cultural modernisation and secularisation processes launched by the post-colonial elites is to invoke the self-past, re - imagined in terms of culturally authentic and `pure' models, and motivated by perceptions of the West (with its agents within the Muslim world) as a threat. In contrast, some of those surveyed in this volume uphold the very same processes of modernisation and secularisation, while dismissing, denying or refuting the issue of their `alien' cultural provenance and their compatibility with an Islamic commitment to transcendence, through a re-imagining of `Islam' that itself rivals the Islamist one. This advocating of `modern' values via a re-imagined Islam nonetheless sets their posture apart from that of the secular intellectuals.<br /><br />The structure of the volume presents a clustering of some chapters, reflecting certain features or tendencies loosely held in common among some of the thinkers consid¬ered. The first chapter discusses the project of the late Pakistani scholar Fazlur Rahman, a towering figure of twentieth-century Islamic reform. Although he spent most of his academic life in the West, as Abdullah Saeed points out, Rahman remained firmly committed to an Islamic process of knowledge, while at the same time subjecting traditional Islamic thought and methodologies to a profound critique. Rahman emphasised areas that have been neglected in Muslim understandings of the Qur'an, and it is from this that his importance largely derives. Such areas include the socio-historical context of the revelation, the spirit of its message as a whole, and the retrieval of its moral elan, as a basis for elabo¬rating a Qur'an-centred ethics. Rahman's wide-ranging influ¬ence is evident in the work of such thinkers as those who form the subject of the two following chapters. These are his former student Nurcholish Madjid, a prominent Indonesian public figure, and the American scholar Amina Wadud.<br /><br />As Anthony H. Johns and Abdullah Saeed demonstrate, Madjid has endeavoured to achieve a pragmatic realisation of Qur'anic values in a manner appropriate to the distinctive character and needs of the Indonesian state. His aim in this is to safeguard Indonesia's integration as a religiously and ethnically plural entity, and to enhance the role of the Pancasila in its capacity as the ideological cornerstone of national unity. His `contextualist' approach to understanding the Qur'an is informed by a recogni¬tion of the pressing need for inter-religious harmony in Indonesia. It is equally motivated by his consciousness of the historically divisive impact of fiqh among Muslims there. Also inspired by Rahman and in contrast with Madjid, Amina Wadud's concern, as described by Asma Barias, is with the problematic of Qur'anic interpretation and the marginalisation of women's full human agency within society. Wadud is a pioneer among a growing cluster of Muslim women scholars who are developing a feminist reading of the Islamic tradition and foundational texts. As Barias, herself a member of this cluster, demonstrates, Wadud highlights the connections between traditional tafsir (exegesis) and the means of its production, explaining the genre's masculinist nature, and its resultant biases against women. She calls for a more egalitarian tafsir, inclusive of women's voices,and reflecting new, holistic modes of understanding and partici¬pation in Muslim religious life. The claim that it upholds the ontological equality of the sexes stands at the core of her own reading of the Qur'an, which thus serves the project of Muslim women's emancipation.<br /><br />It has been suggested that Rahman never consciously intro¬duced analytic procedures derived from Western thinkers in a major manner, and was not attracted to the ongoing debate in Western intellectual circles, even in those areas that influenced his methodology. In contrast, in the assessment of one scholar, in his employment of `the categories of post-modernity' to call for a rethinking of the whole Islamic tradition, the Algerian-French scholar Mohammed Arkoun, seems to be using the Islamic tradition as a text upon which to continue a debate about Western epistemology. He pays little atten¬tion to the specificity of the Islamic condition or tradition, as if the Islamic tradition is expected to serve as a yielding raw material for constructing the epistemological edifice of the West.<br /><br />Arkoun presents his project as a detached, ideologically neutral and radical perspective on the development of the `religious phenomenon', and its implications for present and future human concerns. He rejects any link between his own thought and `islahi (reformist) thinking'. Questioning the assumptions of the historical-critical method, his own critical reading of `Islamic reason', his deconstruction of centuries of Islamic thought, and his constructs of revelation and orthodoxy challenge both academic scholarship on Islam, and Muslim self-understandings. As Ursula Gunther suggests, the `Arkounian' perspective has had little impact on both potential constituencies thus far.<br /><br />The Egyptian scholar Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd introduced a linguistic problematisation of the religious discourse to a contemporary Arabic readership in a substantial manner for the first time. As Navid Kerman shows, his approach is based on application of the most relevant achievements of contemporary linguistics to the Qur'an, combined with literary study of the text and the adoption of Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics. Its conclusions are implicitly posited in opposition to contemporary<br /><br />Islamist discourses with their notion of a single, eternally valid interpretation of the sacred text. This provides the context for understanding postures adopted towards his writings in Egypt, and his trial.<br /><br />Mohamad Mojtahed Shabestari's project provides an example of the rethinking of the Islamic revolutionary tradition in Iran. It represents one trend among post-revolutionary Iranian Islamic discourses, as they endeavour to address the contradictions inherent in the paradigm of what Farzin Vandat terms `mediated subjectivity', inherited from the founders of the Islamic Republic. Well-versed in German theological and philosophical scholar-ship, Shabestari relies on the principle of inter-subjectivity, which he situates within a religious model. He thus adopts a hermeneutic approach to subjectivity, which avoids any direct interpretation of Qur'anic texts. Vandat sees in his hermeneutic construct of inter-subjectivity a framework in terms of which the discourse of religious modernity in post-revolutionary Iran can be advanced, as compared with the inherited paradigm. Shabestari's critique of the negative side of human subjectivity is accompanied by the suggestion that religion, projected as a source of permanent principles and general values, can help ameliorate the crises that accompany the unavoidable moderni¬sation process in Muslim countries.<br /><br />The Tunisian scholar Mohamed Talbi is best known for the case he advances from an Islamic perspective for religious pluralism and inter-religious dialogue, and for his work as a historian of North Africa. Ronald L. Nettler demonstrates how his progressive, liberal ideas are justified through a historical-contextual approach to the Qur'anic text, which seeks to elucidate God's intention in it. His `intentional' reading is put forward as a foun¬dation for resolving the current crisis in the Islamic encounter with modernity, and a foil to the literal readings that plague contemporary Muslim understandings.<br /><br />Osman Tastan points to the pragmatic, utilitarian approach to the Qur'an, and its legal content in particular, developed by the veteran Turkish scholar H&uuml;seyin Atay. Atay's extraction from the Qur'an of practical solutions to specific Islamic issues serves astraightforward understanding and simplified practice of Islam. While this makes it accessible to the general practising public, its rationalist, anti-traditionalist orientation clearly reflects and sits comfortably with the established emphasis on modernity in the Turkish Republican context. This orientation is prominent in the publications of many scholars who, like Atay, are situated in Faculties of Islamic Studies in Turkish universities.<br /><br />The Syrian engineer Mohamad Shahrour and the Libyan writer Sadiq Nayhum share common features. Both emanate from essentially secular backgrounds, and are self-taught in the area of Islamic learning. Driven onto the discursive arena carved by the Islamic resurgence, their engagement with the Qur'an partly serves a critique of traditional Islamic and Islamist formulations and contemporary political conditions. Shahrour advances his `contemporary reading' of the Qur'an as the foundation for a comprehensive project of cultural, social, political and material renewal in Arab-Muslim societies. Andreas Christmann eluci¬dates his employment of a linguistic analysis to reprogramme Qur'anic terminology, thereby estranging readers from conven¬tional understandings and challenging traditional religious authority. As Suha Taji-Faroulzi demonstrates, Nayhum recruits Qur'anic texts in the context of a call for a culturally rooted form of direct democracy, embedded in `Islam' reconstructed as a formula for political emancipation. To some extent, his resort to the Qur'an suggests a `ritualistic' acknowledgement of the Islamic textual tradition. At the same time, it illustrates the appeal of the `Qur'anic message', however appropriated, among secular-oriented Muslim intellectuals confronting the experience of alienation and fragmentation brought by modernity.<br /><br />By way of conclusion to this introductory chapter, attention must be drawn to a reform-oriented but Islamically rooted voice, which has become increasingly influential during the late twentieth century, reflecting a certain resonance with a broad public understanding in Muslim societies. This is the voice of reform-minded Muslim intellectuals and academics and a small number of reform-minded ulama, whose diverse contributions, put together, bear witness to important patterns of intellectual devel¬opment and change in contemporary Islamic thought.<br /><br />While such reform-oriented thinkers might themselves be subject to various Western influences,having in some cases been trained in Western universities, they work self-consciously from within Islamic cultural and textual traditions, and adhere to an Islamic frame of reference. Often with an eye to invalidating extremist Islamic postures, they address the ongoing challenge of elaborating modern Islamic responses to the modalities and demands of the modern experience, and the profoundly changed realities and novel problems of modern Muslim life. Their inter¬pretive approach to the Qur'an and Sunna is direct and pays attention to social and historical contexts, distinguishing between universal principles and the moral thrust of the revelation on the one hand, and directives that may be bound to its specific circumstances on the other. In determining the meanings and implications of the revelation, they draw on the rich legacy of Islamic tradition in its diverse branches, while carefully probing the complex relation between this tradition and the context of its elaboration, taking into account aspects of its contingency.<br /><br />Some of these thinkers deconstruct and critique aspects of the project of Western modernity, often sharing common ground in this with the critical discourse of modernity and its post-modern critics. However, they part company with the latter in their Islamic frame of reference, and their concern to offer `constructive' responses to the human predicament. Refusing to bow to a blanket privileging of the modern over the pre-modern, they maintain that modernity's characteristic sense of superiority must be tempered with a respect for pre-modern sources which, if properly contextualised, can yield much that is of value. Others divest the modern West of its claims to universal validity; their commitment to Islamic cultural resources derives further confi¬dence from an awareness that, at this juncture in history, there is a possibility for other voices to be received with less prejudice. Crucially, their contributions explore and advocate significant contemporary areas of reform within this culture, includingdemocratisation, pluralism, tolerance, openness to other reli¬gions, and equality of status for women and minorities in Muslim societies. Their arguments in this regard evince an alertness to the specific worldview upon which concepts and institutions are premised, identifying what may be incompatible with an Islamic cosmology and a commitment to transcendence.<br /><br />Certain of the thinkers presented in this volume clearly contribute to this reform-oriented, Islamically rooted trend, which is exemplified to varying degrees by such figures as Khaled Abou El Fadl, Muhammad Salim al-`Awwa, Mohammad Hashim Kamali, Taha Jabir al- `Alwani and the `professional' `alimYusuf al-Qaradawi, to name a few. Relative to them, others studied here create an impression that they are Westernised liberals still under the spell of Western modernity, seeing in it a solution to the needs and problems of Muslim societies. In contrast with both, yet others discussed in this volume appear to have set out on the postmodernist road, which in its extreme form can ultimately lead to nihilism.<br /><br />The reform-oriented Islamic discourse sketched in these concluding lines remains intimately connected to the reformist discourse of the turn of the twentieth century. Those who contribute to it are perhaps the genuine heirs to the reformists' legacy, while taking this into uncharted waters towards a destination yet unclear, in an unpredictable and rapidly changing context. What is clear is the bid made by such thinkers to avoid the pitfalls and excesses of modernity, and to preserve the moral and cultural integrity of the Islamic worldview, and the special Islamic identity and cohesion of Muslim societies. In the wider world, the contribution of this discourse perhaps lies ultimately in its non-negotiable commitment to applying an ethical dimension to the exercise of reason and power. In Muslim countries, it might respond effectively to pressing concerns for the injection of justice and morality into the political and socio-economic order, while avoiding the problems and excesses inherent in certain Islamist options<br /><br />The `West' is now an omnipresent party to the ongoing process of re-negotiating Islam among Muslims, in which this reform trend represents one of many competing voices. This undeni¬ably complicates the task that confronts it, whether in invalidating extremist Islamic formulations, or galvanising Muslim opinion in the endeavour to establish an effective bridge between the demands of an ever-changing present and a commitment to eternal values and the tradition and culture that embody them.

Van Der Steen (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 130: Peeters) There is little doubt that Van Der Steen has created a monograph critiquing the way classical archaeologists make sense of their data. It is likely to rpvoke much debate in the field as well as revise certain ways Jordan Valley sites are interpreted.<br /><br />Excerpt: \\"In an effort to make archaeology an exact science, the New Archae¬ology tried to find general, \\"covering laws\\" . Such laws were hard to find, or are defined in such broad terms that they become meaningless. The heavy use of jargon was disturbing. Models often became an end rather than the tool for creating a more meaningful analysis. The new archaeology focused primarily on prehistoric phases and on cultural changes, and neglects historical cases. At least in its more dogmatic forms, it failed to discuss political borders in a satisfactory way, since it created a sharp dichotomy between pots and people - as if pots were independent beings.\\"<br /><br />This rather harsh judgment, by Raz Kletter (Kletter 1999, 21-22), of the tools and the philosophy of New Archaeology, precisely outlines the difficulties that Near Eastern archaeologists tend to have with the con¬cepts of New Archaeology. The quote contains some useful warnings, puts the concept of model-building into perspective, and underlines the purposes of this study.<br /><br />.. the new archaeology tried to find general, \\"covering laws\\" ...\\"<br /><br />Covering laws, or models that can predict human behaviour within a set of specified conditions (such as climate, surroundings, population density) are indeed hard to find, basically because humans do not behave like numbers, or chemical substances that turn from solid to fluid to gas under specified pressure and temperature. We want human behaviour to be predictable. And it is, or can be, to a certain extent. But only to a cer¬tain extent. Human reactions follow the laws of sociobiology, and therefore `universal' laws can be described in order to explain, analyse and `predict' historical events and situations. Of course, human behaviour, like that of other living creatures, can never be completely predicted. On the other hand, occasional deviations from the general laws do not invalidate them.<br /><br />Any model that describes or explains human behaviour, should be based on reality, on actual observations. This may seem self evident, but as Kletter states: \\"Such laws were hard to find, or are defined in such broad terms that they become meaningless.\\" We must be aware that sometimes models may be valid, or represent reality for one situation, period or group, but not for others. We must be prepared to limit ourselves, in order to remain meaningful. The reality that I propose here, and that limits my model in a spatial sense, although hardly in a temporal one, is that the Southern Levant has always, at least since the Early Bronze Age, been a tribal society.<br /><br />The word `tribal' has many connotations. In western society, and in New Archaeology, it is associated with a relatively low level of social organisation. In Near Eastern contexts it is often associated with economic behaviour, notably the herding of sheep and goats, and the breeding of camels. That, how-ever, is not the essence of `tribalism'. Sometimes the word `tribal' is replaced by `kin-based' (Joffe 1993), or `ethnic' (Kamp and Yoffee 1980), or `family' (Stager 1985). The meaning of these terms, however, also covers only part of what Levantine social organisation was about.<br /><br />Much information has come down to us about tribal or Bedouin soci¬ety in the southern Levant in the past centuries, both from western trav¬ellers and researchers and from the Bedouin themselves. These sources define Levantine tribalism within a framework of characteristics that, together, can describe what I would call a `model' for social organisation in the Southern Levant, not only in theperiod under study, but which can be detected already in the Early Bronze Age (van der Steen 2002a), and the structural basis of which never ceased to exist. This structural basis became especially clear in periods of change and insta¬bility. Whatever caused these periods, external political pressure, or climate changes, the result was always that society had to regroup itself, re-divide its territories, find new modes of existence and of cooperation. In those periods the tribal structure of society was decisive in determining the course of events and the eventual new situation that evolved.<br /><br />In periods of stability the tribal structural basis may have been less clear, `sleeping' as it were, but it never died, because the next crisis always saw it reawaken and become the major force in restructuring society. This is what happened in the transition from the Late Bronze to the Early Iron Age, the period under study here.<br /><br />Information about tribes, and about the tribal organisation of society has come down to us from very early periods, starting perhaps with the Middle Bronze Age execration texts. Other sources are the Bible, Assyrian and Babylonian sources, numerous Roman and Byzantine sources, and many more. The main dif¬ference between these sources and the 19th century travel accounts is, that the last, perhaps for the first time, do not describe bedouin and nomadic tribes from a hostile point of view. Travellers such as Burck¬hardt and Bell had a profound knowledge of the tribes they travelled with, and although many travellers may have felt closer to the children of the sown than to those of the desert, they felt no particular animosity against the bedouin, and their interest in bedouin society, even if they rejected it, was real. The position of the Old Testament - which is, after all, the story of the events of a tribal confederation - is internally biased, and will be dealt with separately (see Ch. 1).<br /><br />Information from all these sources, but especially those from the nine¬teenth century AD can be used to describe the characteristics that deter-mine this tribal social structure. These characteristics are:<br /><br />loyalty. A tribesman's loyalty was always first to his family, to his clan, and to the tribe to which he belonged. At the same time the tribe as a whole was responsible for the individual member: for his subsis¬tence in case of emergencies (such as a raid by a rival tribe, which sometimes left families without anything to eat), for his protection, or, if that failed, for avenging him. This two-way loyalty was formalised by creating `family ties' between the members of the tribes: patriarchs (or sometimes matriarchs) from which all members were assumed to descend. These ties were created and could be changed easily in order to create new loyalties, should circumstances demand that. The term khawa, being a tribute paid by one tribe to another, or by an individual or group of individuals in order to be able to travel through a tribe's territory, literally means `brotherhood', and so denotes the fact that by paying it, the person became a temporary `brother' of the tribe, a mem¬ber of the family, and shared in the ties of loyalty and responsibility.<br /><br />Tribal loyalties, although they may have been meaningless to all prac¬tical purposes, did not cease to exist in periods of stability, or strong external power. They were always maintained, albeit on a low level.<br /><br />Second is flexibility in economic pursuits. Tribes and their members had access to different, customised economic pursuits (Salzman 1980, 4). They could be herders of goats or sheep, professional camel breeders, agriculturalists or horticulturalists. The Howeitat, for exam¬ple, were famous camel breeders for the Hajj and the regular trade and they had vast date palm groves around Aqaba. Besides, they con-trolled a number of agricultural villages in Edom, where members of smaller tribes grew tobacco and other goods for the benefit of the Hajj. According to Bocco (cited in Layne 1994, 46) \\"even archetyp¬ical camel-herding Bedouin were probably never exclusively pas¬toralists but relied on a multi-resource economy that included raiding, the collection of tribute (khawa) and trading for their subsistence\\". Depending on circumstances, agriculture, or herding, or trading could be the main source of income at a certain time. It was because of this ability to adapt, that the Bedouin could control the economy of the region, and create a virtually independent society in the late eigh¬teenth and early nineteenth centuries AD, even adapting to external influences such as the demands of the European trade with India.<br /><br />The third characteristic is mobility, which directly involves the rela¬tionship of a tribe to the land. Many (but not all) tribes were mobile to a certain extent. Sometimes they were part-time farmers, and had summer and winter quarters; sometimes segments of tribes had become sedentary, while other segments remained pastoral nomads. Many con¬tinued to live in tents as a symbol of mobility, even after they had become full-time farmers or otherwise sedentary. The tent was the sym¬bol of their inheritance, and therefore maintained a symbolic status that was denied to a house. Honoured guests were, and sometimes still are, received in a tent, rituals and parties are still often performed in tents.<br /><br />A tribe had a territory or territories, but could only assert rights to this land, when they were actually present. They did not `own' the land. Lancaster (1981, 121) describes the relation of the Rwala Bedouin to their land as based on \\"a prior claim of usufruct (a claim not a right)\\". A person \\"only rules (the land) when he is there and he only owns it under the same circumstances\\". They own it by right of dominance and not exclusively. Other tribes came into the territory when the Rwala had gone, or even when they were present, by right of tradition or strength. The continuing high symbolic status of the tent mentioned above suggests that this flexible relationship to the land did not change, even in periods of stability and settlement.<br /><br />The fourth characteristic is the interrelationship between tribes. Tribes interacted, both in a positive and in a negative sense. In a positive sense they crossed and used each other's territories and wells, often following a formalised system of khawa, they intermarried, they made alliances and formed confederations. Judges from allied or associated tribes could be called in to solve legal disputes.<br /><br />Negative interaction consisted of ghazu, intertribal raiding, and some-times even actual wars between tribes, usually over territory. These wars could lead to a profound change in the balance of power, and changes in the traditional territories of tribes, creating a `domino-effect' that could eventually have repercussions over long distances, as uprooted tribes had to go and look elsewhere for new territories. The sources show that these changes in power balance usually coincided with international political crises: in the Islamic period (622-1918 AD) the changes from one government to another always resulted in a com¬plete change in power balance and territorial division among the Near Eastern tribes.<br /><br />This is the framework within which society in the Southern Levant has functioned ever since the Early Bronze Age. There may have been times when a strong external government managed to subdue the power of the independent tribes, but they were never capable of extinguishing the tribal structure of the local population.<br /><br />\\"The new archaeology focused primarily on prehistoric phases and on cultural changes, and neglects historical cases...\\".<br /><br />The problem with `historical periods', i.e. periods for which written sources are available, is that these written sources cannot very well be ignored. In the past, before the time of the New Archaeology, archaeol¬ogy was usually made subject to these written sources, and used to illustrate them. The Bible is a case in point, specifically for the region under study. The nineteenth century spirit of discovery was reflected in the realms of Christianity as well. The need was felt not only to `illustrate' the Bible, but to prove it by identifying (and excavating) holy places. In 1865 the Palestine Exploration Fund had been established as \\"A society for the accurate and systematic investigation of the Archaeology, the Topography, the Geology and Physical Geography, the Manners and Customs of the Holy Land for Biblical Illustration;\\" the American School for Oriental Research, established in 1900 had as its main goal \\"to defend the Bible\\". Numerous explorers travelled the `Land of the Bible' and identified (sometimes with little evidence) place-names mentioned in the Bible (Ben-Arieh 1979, with numerous references). The fact that they travelled through tribal territo¬ries, and therefore had to deal with the existing tribal system, and the meticulous accounts they left us of these travels, now give us a rare insight in the tribal society of the nineteenth century AD.<br /><br />With the rise of New Archaeology this situation was changed. Archaeological evidence came into its right as an independent source of information. The result was that written sources became a disturbing factor, since the evidence presented by them often disagreed with the archaeological remains. Hence the tendency of New Archaeology to turn to `prehistoric' periods and situations.<br /><br />However, both the written sources and the archaeological remains have a tale to tell, about the same period and the same people, and if the two diverge it is our task to explain why they do so and to find a histor¬ical explanation in which both have their role (cf. Weippert 1967, 133-139). We cannot ignore one or the other because they do not fit in our hypothesis. If that is the case the hypothesis is wrong.<br /><br />This study starts with an overview of the various available sources of evidence. Chapter 1 reviews written sources dating from and/or relating to the period of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. These sources play an important role in the hypothesis. Many of them come from an Egyptian, Late Bronze Age context. They are the accounts of Canaanite society as seen by the conquerors and therefore very one-sided, although none the less valuable for that. They create a picture of the period from one point of view, that of the foreign ruler. The Amarna let¬ters, an important source of information, add the dimension of the view-point of the local rulers. Their split loyalty, on the one hand to the for¬eign ruler that put them - and kept them - in their position, and on the other hand to their own people, provides a valuable insight in the social structure of the times. Finally the editors of the books of the Old Testament, writing much later, in the exilic or post-exilic period, give us an account of the Early Iron Age in Israel the way they saw it. Their view was coloured as well, by time and ideology, and reflected to a large extent society as it was in the Late Iron Age. If anything, this shows us that even in the Late Iron Age, Israel and its neighbours were largely seen as a tribal society. The world was ordered along lines of kinship and loyalties or enmities based on traditional tribal feuds. Like in earlier periods contact with the great empires and their organisation could not wipe out this kin-based structure. It was always there, dormant perhaps, but never dead.<br /><br />The second chapter describes the physical world in which this society originated and flourished: the soil and its fertility, the climate and the topography.<br /><br />Chapters 3 and 4 give an overview of the available archaeological evi¬dence, excavations and settlement patterns. The importance of settlement patterns lies for a large part in that they are oftenthe only physical evi¬dence of the presence of a non-settled population. Nomads are notorious in that they leave no archaeological remains such as pottery, architecture and the like (see the discussion in Finkelstein 1995, 23 ff, with references). The only indications of their presence in a certain society can be the way they influence settlement patterns. In the first half of the nineteenth cen¬tury AD in the East Jordan Valley there were no settlements, and in the Belqa the only settlement was Salt. The bedouin tribes of the Adwan and Beni Sakhr both claimed these territories and struggled over it. They regu¬larly robbed villages and eventually scared away the settled population. When the Ottoman government finally managed to subdue the Beni Sakhr in the second half of the nineteenth century a power vacuum ensued in the region, which was quickly filled up with small villages and farmsteads.<br /><br />\\"... it failed to discuss political borders in a satisfactory way...\\"<br /><br />Chapter 5 deals with the political borders of the nineteenth and early twentieth century AD and the ways in which the different groups defined their territories, both in a social and geographical sense, by loyalty, by positive or negative interaction and by moving around. It is a period in which the tribal organisation dominated the southern Levant, and that has been described extensively by both western and eastern writers and researchers. The results of this analysis are returned to in Chapter 11, analysing the mechanisms that were at work in the transition from the Late Bronze to the Early Iron Age. I have stated above that the structural basis in the area of study remained the same from the Early Bronze Age to the most recent past. This structural basis dictated the reactions of the population to the changing society, both in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries AD and in the Late Bronze - Early Iron Age transi¬tional period. The ethnographers and travellers in the region tell us how<br /><br />the population of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reacted and adapted to these changes, and therefore may give us an insight into how the population of the Late Bronze - Early Iron Age transitional period reacted.<br /><br />\\" ...since it created a sharp dichotomy between pots and people - as if pots were independent beings.\\"<br /><br />Pots, obviously, are not independent beings, nor is any other artefact. They are the precipitation of a culture, of a person, a group or a sequence of people who performed an activity that created, made use of, and discarded the artefact that we now hold in our hands. It is the people behind the pots that we have to find. Henk Franken used to say that archaeolo¬gists tended to view potsherds as if they had fallen from trees, mainly for dating purposes (cf. Steiner 1994, thesis 8). We have to close the gap between pots and people again, but in a meaningful way. We have to ask ourselves who the people were that made the pots, who the people were that used and discarded them. We have to ask what the meaning is of changes in the pottery, what it tells us about those people. That is the essence of Chapters 6 and 7. In Chapter 6 an overview is given of the pot¬tery that has been published from excavations in the region under study and the surrounding area. In Chapter 7, using Deir `Alla as a case study, I try to analyse what the actual meaning and significance is of changes in pottery shapes and functional repertoire, for the understanding of the history of a certain site.<br /><br />Chapters 8 and 9 are devoted to the results of new research, some of which is published here for the first time. The first two seasons at Tell el-Hammeh in the Zerqa valley (Chapter 8) produced unexpected results. The remains of the oldest iron smelting site in the world found so far were excavated (Veldhuizen and van der Steen 1999). The excavations also revealed the existence of a number of Late Bronze Age layers, no traces of which had ever been found by any of the surveys on the site. These results went a long way to confirm the hypothesis of a trade route through the Zerqa valley, conducted by independent traders.<br /><br />The region that this study focuses on in particular, the area between the watershed of the Wadi Kufrinjeh in the north and that of the Wadi Zerqa in the south, has been chosen because of its high concentration of Late Bronze Age sites (Leonard 1989) compared to the rest of the East Jordan Valley. This concentration is revealed by a number of surveys, since very few sites in the area had been excavated and even fewer<br /><br />published. In 1994 some of the sites that had been discovered by earlier surveys, such as those of Nelson Glueck, and of the Jordan Valley Sur¬vey, were revisited and pottery collected from them. In addition to this, the pottery from the Jordan Valley Survey was studied in Amman, and that of Nelson Glueck in Jerusalem. The results of the revisited sites, as well as the relevant pottery from the older surveys are presented in Chapter 9, together with the conclusions drawn from both the Nelson Glueck and Jordan Valley surveys, and from the revisited sites, about the occupation history of the area.<br /><br />Models often became an end rather than the tool for creating a more meaningful analysis....\\"<br /><br />In the exact sciences, the purpose of research is to find universal laws and to test whether these are really universally valid. The final purpose in historical sciences, such as history or archaeology, is arguable. In New Archaeology, as stated by Kletter, models became an end in them-selves, and history and archaeology were used to test and refine the `universal' models that were developed to predict human behaviour. That is, of course, a perfectly valid approach, provided that the models as such were adapted to fit the historical facts. This proved to be com¬plicated, especially in historical periods; hence the tendency of New Archaeology to concentrate on less complicated, prehistoric periods. Of course, these periods were, or seemed, less complicated, only because we knew so much less about them. The other approach is to use the models as tools to explain and understand historical events and situations. Then they form the basis for a hypothesis, an analysis of a specific period, group or event.<br /><br />Several efforts have been made to devise models for the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages in the Levant. Some of these were broad models, encompassing the period in question in a long lasting development, usu¬ally starting in the Chalcolithic or the Early Bronze Age. Most of these models had a cyclical character. Other models, or hypotheses were developed to find an explanation for the Late Bronze - Early Iron Age transition, more specifically (most of them) to find an explanation for the beginnings of early Israel. These hypotheses do not usually claim universal validity, unlike some of the cyclical models.<br /><br />Chapter 10 discusses models and hypotheses that have been devel¬oped and used for the Late Bronze - Early Iron Age transition in the Southern Levant.<br /><br />Chapters 11 and 12 finally give my own hypothesis for this period. This hypothesis is based on the model that I have outlined above, of a society that has always remained essentially tribal. I have explained why I think this model is universally valid in the Southern Levant, at least from the Early Bronze Age, until the twentieth century AD. There may have been periods in which it was more visible than in others, but the simple fact that it is applicable for every period of crisis or change in the history of the Southern Levant shows clearly enough that it was always present. I am tempted to state that it still exists to a certain extent. I will not expand on the validity of the model in periods other than that under study; that has been done elsewhere. These two chapters are an integration of the historical facts and figures that have been outlined in the previous chapters, and the concept of a basi¬cally tribal society. The result aims at a more meaningful analysis and explanation of the archaeological remains that time has left us.urces dating from and/or relating to the period of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages.

Andries Van Der Ark, Marcel A. Croon, Klaas Sijtsma (Quantitative Methodology Series: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates) Almost all research in the social and behavioral sciences, economics, marketing, criminology, and medicine deals with the analysis of categorical data. Categorical data are quantified as either nominal variables-distinguishing different groups, for example, based on socio-economic status, education, and political persuasion-or ordinal variables-distinguishing levels of interest, such as the preferred politician for President or the preferred type of punishment for committing burglary. New Developments in Categorical Data Analysis for the Social and Behavioral Sciences is a collection of up-to-date studies on modern categorical data analysis methods, emphasizing their application to relevant and interesting data sets.<br /><br />A prominent breakthrough in categorical data analysis are latent variable models. This volume concentrates on two such classes of models-latent class analysis and item response theory. These methods use latent variables to explain the relationships among observed categorical variables. Latent class analysis yields the classification of a group of respondents according to their pattern of scores on the categorical variables. This provides insight into the mechanisms producing the data and allows the estimation of factor structures and regression models conditional on the latent class structure. Item response theory leads to the identification of one or more ordinal or interval scales. In psychological and educational testing these scales are used for individual measurement of abilities and personality traits. Item response theory has been extended to also deal with, for example, hierarchical data structures and cognitive theories explaining performance on tests.<br /><br />Excerpt: The focus of this volume is applied. After a method is explained, the potential of the method for analyzing categorical data is illustrated by means of a real data example to show how it can be used effectively for solving a real data problem. These methods are accessible to researchers not trained explicitly in applied statistics. This volume appeals to researchers and advanced students in the social and behavioral sciences, including social, developmental, organizational, clinical and health psychologists, sociologists, educational and marketing researchers, and political scientists. In addition, it is of interest to those who collect data on categorical variables and are faced with the problem of how to analyze such variables-among themselves or in relation to metric variables.<br /><br />Almost all research in the social and behavioral sciences, and also in eco¬nomic and marketing research, criminological research, and social medical research deals with the analysis of categorical data. Categorical data are quantified as either nominal or ordinal variables. This volume is a collec¬tion of up-to-date studies on modern categorical data analysis methods, emphasizing their application to relevant and interesting data sets.<br /><br />Different scores on nominal variables distinguish groups. Examples known to everyone are gender, socioeconomic status, education, religion, and political persuasion. Other examples, perhaps less well known, are the type of solution strategy used by a child to solve a mental problem in an intelligence test and different educational training programs used to teach language skills to eight-year old pupils. Because nominal scores only identify groups, calculations must use this information but no more; thus, addition and multiplication of such scores lead to meaningless results.<br /><br />Different scores on ordinal variables distinguish levels of interest, but differences between such numbers hold no additional information. Such scores are rank numbers or transformations of rank numbers. Examples are the ordering of types of education according to level of sophistication, the choice of most preferred politician to run for president, the preference for type of punishment in response to burglary without using violence, and the degree in which someone who recently underwent surgery rates his or her daily quality of life as expressed on an ordered rating scale.<br /><br />Originally, the analysis of categorical data was restricted to counting frequencies, collecting them in cross tables, and determining the strength of the relationship between variables. Nowadays, a powerful collection of statistical methods is available that enables the researcher to exhaust his or her categorical data in ways that seemed illusory only one or two decades ago.<br /><br />A prominent breakthrough in categorical data analysis is the devel¬opment and use of latent variable models. This volume concentrates on two such classes of models, latent class analysis and item response theory. These methods assume latent variables to explain the relationships among observed categorical variables. Roughly, if the latent variable is also cate¬gorical the method is called latent class analysis and if it is continuous the method is called item response theory.<br /><br />Latent class analysis basically yields the classification of a group of re¬spondents according to their most likely pattern of scores on the categorical variables. Not only does this provide insight into the mechanisms producing the data, but modern latent class analysis also allows for the estimation of, for example, factor structures and regression models conditional on the la-tent class structure. Item response theory leads to the identification of one or more ordinal or interval scales. In psychological and educational testing these scales are used for individual measurement of abilities and person¬ality traits. Item response theory has been extended to also deal with, for example, hierarchical data structures and cognitive theories explaining performance on tests.<br /><br />These developments are truly exiting because they enable us to get so much more out of our data than was ever dreamt of before. In fact, when realizing the potential of modern days statistical machinery one is tempted to dig up all those data sets collected not-so-long ago and re-analyze them with the latent class analysis and item response theory methods we now have at our disposal. To give the reader some flavor of these methods, the focus of most contributions in this volume has been kept applied; that is, after a method is explained, the potential of the method for analyzing categorical data is illustrated by means of a real data example. The purpose is to explain methods at a level that is accessible to researchers not trained explicitly in applied statistics and then show how it can be used effectively for solving a real data problem.ypes of education according to level of sophistication, the choice of most preferred politician to run for president, the preference for type of punishment in response to burglary without using violence, and the degree in which someone who recently underwent surgery rates his or her daily quality of life as expressed on an ordered rating scale. <br />Originally, the analysis of categorical data was restricted to counting frequencies, collecting them in cross tables, and determining the strength of the relationship between variables.

Not only does this provide insight into the mechanisms producing the data, but modern latent class analysis also allows for the estimation of, for example, factor structures and regression models conditional on the la-tent class structure. Item response theory leads to the identification of one or more ordinal or interval scales. In psychological and educational testing these scales are used for individual measurement of abilities and personality traits. Item response theory has been extended to also deal with, for example, hierarchical data structures and cognitive theories explaining performance on tests. <br />These developments are truly exiting because they enable us to get so much more out of our data than was ever dreamt of before. In fact, when realizing the potential of modern days statistical machinery one is tempted to dig up all those data sets collected not-so-long ago and re-analyze them with the latent class analysis and item response theory methods we now have at our disposal. To give the reader some flavor of these methods, the focus of most contributions in this volume has been kept applied; that is, after a method is explained, the potential of the method for analyzing categorical data is illustrated by means of a real data example. The purpose is to explain methods at a level that is accessible to researchers not trained explicitly in applied statistics and then show how it can be used effectively for solving a real data problem. <br />	2005-01-24

Benjafield (Oxford University Press) Excerpt: An important development for any historian of psychology is the appearance of a new journal, History of Psychology, which has provided an important forum for scholars in this area. The last few years have been especially fruitful for research in the history of psychology and I have tried to incorporate as much of this new material as I can while still preserving what continues to be relevant from the first edition.<br /><br />While important changes have been made to each chapter, some of these changes are more notable than others. Chapter 1 now contains a comparison of the similarity of Aristotle's theory of intelligence to a modern version. At the suggestion of reviewers, more material on associ¬ationism, particularly in regard to the Mills, has been added to Chapter 2. As pointed out above, there has been a great deal of recent research on nineteenth-century psychology, enriching Chapters 3 (nineteenth-century pioneers), 4 (Wundt and his contemporaries), and 5 (James). Freud and Jung (Chapter 6) continue to becontroversial figures. For example, Freud's 'seduc¬tion theory' is the focus of continuing investigation. The contemporary relevance of functional psychology is more clearly brought out in Chapter 7. Intriguing new research has also been brought to bear on Bekhterev, Lashley, and Skinner (Chapter 8). We now have a much fuller understanding of their psychology and its rela¬tion to their character and cultural context. Our understanding of Gestalt psychology (Chapter 9) as a movement and its relation to German culture has also benefited from new scholarship. Fisher and the null hypothesis (Chapter 10) have in recent years become a very rich and controversial story. Chapter 11 (Theories of Learning) now contains material on Roger Sperry, whose work had unfortunately been omitted from the first edition. Chapter 12 (The Developmental Point of View) now considers the history of the develop-mental approach at the University of Toronto, including a discussion of the treatment of the Dionne quintuplets. After being a somewhat dormant force in psychology, the humanistic approach (Chapter 13) shows signs of being appreciated anew. Cognitive psychology (Chapter 14), still one of the dominant orientations in contemporary psychology, has been the focus of much attention from historians, allowing us to appreciate its origins more deeply. All of the topics in Chapter 15, including the nature of paradigms, social constructionism, feminism, and postmodernism, have been intensely investigated recently. Taken as a whole, the new research in the history of psychology demonstrates its con¬tinuing relevance to the psychology curriculum.<br /><br />In addition to the foregoing, the following specific changes have been made to the new edition:<br /><br />* The bibliography has been made more useful to students.

Faulk (Ohio University Press) The late-Victorian discovery of the music hall by English intellectuals marks a crucial moment in the history of popular culture. Music Hall and Modernity demonstrates how such pioneering cultural critics as Arthur Symons and Elizabeth Robins Pennell used the music hall to secure and promote their professional identity as guardians of taste and national welfare. At the same time, these social arbiters were devotees of the spontaneous culture of \\"the people?'<br /><br />In examining fiction by Walter Besant, Hall Caine, and Henry Nevinson, performance criticism by William Archer and Max Beerbohm, and late-Victorian controversies over philanthropy and moral reform, Barry J. Faulk argues that discourse on music-hall entertainment helped consolidate the identity and tastes of an emergent professional class. Critics and writers legitimized and cleaned up the music hall, while allowing issues of class, respect, and empowerment to be negotiated.<br /><br />Music Hall and Modernity offers a complex view of the burgeoning middle-class, middle-brow, mass culture of late-Victorian London and contributes a new perspective to a growing body of scholarship on nineteenth-century urbanism.<br /><br />Excerpt: At the turn of the last century, London music hall crossed class lines, drawing a substantial middle- and upper-class patronage along with its core working-class audience. When culture forms cross over in this way, they acquire a spate of interpreters, with a range of interpretations, for crossover elicits interpretive diversity, and the social work of interpretation further enhances cultural mobility. Observers disagreed over the significance of music hall's popular success; public debate exposed some core late-Victorian beliefs regarding class and gender identity. The movement of the music hall into the dominant culture unsettled the confidence of some middle-class observers that taste and class could serve as a natural divide between social groups.<br /><br />It also enabled a new group of observers to speak on behalf of a different En-gland.<br /><br />The greater diffusion of music-hall culture raised significant questions about the secure fit between class and taste. In his magisterial work Distinction, Pierre Bourdieu provides powerful evidence that taste claims are the indirect but inevitable expression of class status, and thus sustain class difference and hierarchy. Bourdieu provides a synchronic view of the relations between social rank and taste preferences that verges on positing direct causal links between an individual's taste and affect and his or her status. He de-scribes the habitus of culture as \\"a structuring structure\\" and \\"also a structured structure\\"-forceful efforts to overleap structure by compounding what structure means, and to consider the relation between taste and status as a process.' Nevertheless, these compound terms inevitably leave us with a stable notion of taste as it relates to class hierarchy: and when culture forms break out to larger audiences, the connections between taste claims and various forms of belonging, whether racial, classed, or gendered, shift in unpredictable ways. Like any elite, intellectuals can and do work to naturalize their class position through taste statements; they can also serve as sensitive registers of changing relations between cultural preferences and social position.<br /><br />We can better map social relations between class and taste if we treat taste making as a dialogic process, diachronically as well as synchronically. In tracing the changes that late-Victorian music hall made to the dominant culture, I join a conversation in cultural studies with, among others, Stuart Hall, An-drew Ross, and Janice Radway. These scholars attend to the many ways in which the circulation of culture forms expands the very categories that enable cultural flow, so that,for example, Janice Radway, in A Feeling for Books: The Book-of-the-Month Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-Class Desire, draws attention to how the production of the middlebrow unsettles the divide tastemakers established between high- and low-culture product. Andrew Ross, in No Respect, details how the reception of discourses like erotica or bebop depends on the mutual labor of both culture producers from various class strata and aspiring intellectual, predominantly bourgeois, tastemakers. Stuart Hall, in \\"Notes on Deconstructing the Popular;\\" forcefully argues that scholarly at-tempts to recover the popular as pure vernacular expression obscure the very processes by which the popular is constructed. The historicist attempt to re-cover the real vernacular, like the purist search for culture as authentic product, cannot register the subtle but pervasive changes that occur in producers, audiences, and conceptual categories when cultural forms travel.<br /><br />My claim that fin-de-si&egrave;cle language of the popular should be read as a professional discourse builds on Hall's argument. For example, in the process of packaging proletarian comedy and dance to middle-class spectators, music-hall theater owners and promoters often watered down the variety fare they packaged. This compromise, however, was not well received by some of music hall's middle-class critics. These bourgeois observers some-times interpreted the conscious effort to sanitize the music hall as an at-tempt to neutralize it, an appropriative gesture that revealed the greed and sterility-the worst qualities-of the culture of their class. These critics were angry that music hall's success situated it in the cultural middle; they were also upset with the apparent satisfaction of bourgeois audiences with this state of affairs. The middle-class patron of the halls insufficiently esteemed the low, according to critics like Max Beerbohm, a feature of whose \\"high-brow\\" taste discourse was hatred of the middle. The move of music-hall entertainment toward the middle of the road caused Max Beerbohm to treat conventional tastes more skeptically, rather than relinquish his positive response to the earlier, d&eacute;class&eacute; music hall. The inevitability of the bourgeois co-optation of vernacular culture spurred Beerbohm to imagine music hall as the culture of the opposition, even if that opposition included only him-self and an elite corps of observers.<br /><br />The transformation of the music hall into middle-class culture had myriad consequences. For example, the diffusion of the form made it more difficult for middle-class observers to distinguish their own culture from that of the working class. The ambiguity of the music hall, the puzzling nature of its hold on a broad English public, made it an ideal talking point for intellectuals seeking to flex their muscles as culture definers and interpreters. In the process of becoming dominant, a subaltern culture form clarified the practice of its \\"other\\": a professional cultural criticism that often used music-hall analysis to address broader national and cultural concerns.<br /><br />This new professional critic no longer worked according to the assumption of the critic's exclusive, privileged relation to culture. The very success of the music hall had made apparent the double-voiced, composite nature of English culture, and the stance of the aficionado shared this synergy. In this fashion, the accounts of the middle-class observer of the halls mirrored the form of the late-Victorian halls, which mingled bourgeois and working-class modes of thinking in an effort to hail the broadest possible audience.<br /><br />When late-Victorian intellectuals assumed the mantle of culture legislators, articulating the music hall as the popular, they often produced a trope that alienated the people from the popular. But the growing social prominence of the music hall also provoked professional middleclass observers to assume complex spectator positions, like Arthur Symons's pose of the aficionado. He assumed a shifting, hybrid perspective on the entertainment that melded the disinterested view of the trained culture critic with the view of the passionate advocate.oward the middle of the road caused Max Beerbohm to treat conventional tastes more skeptically, rather than relinquish his positive response to the earlier, dclass music hall.

It utilizes the strengths of both editors. Barnstone has dealt with some of this material before in his 20 year-old The Other Bible. This new selection concentrates more on gnosticism and less on other biblical psudepigrapha, early Kabbalah, haggadah, midrash, christian apocrypha. Comparing where there is overlap Barnstone has offers some crisp poetic renderings in this new volume rather than the more technically dry academic copy present in some selection in the The Other Bible. Touches of barnes fine literary sense shine forth here and there in The Gnostic Bible. Marvin Meyer is best known for his generally accessible accounts of classic religions and popular magic during the rise of Christianity. His Ancient Christian Magic and The Ancient Mysteries provide useful entr&eacute;e into current debates by religious scholars and historians.

From the founding of the Bay through the time of the Great Awakening, the doctrine of assurance gave rise to two specific questions: How can one know whether or not the heart has been renewed? Is assurance to be required for full standing in the Church? The dilemma over whether to extend church membership to the descendants of full church members, or restrict it to those who could demonstrate assurance of saving faith, also gave rise to the question of how New England should be defined. To some the Halfway Covenant of 1662 was a sign of weakness, in that it allowed a form of membership to those who could not claim full assurance. To others the Halfway Covenant had strengthened the churches of New England in that it kept under \\"church discipline\\" the descendants of \\"visible saints.\\" Halfway members, in external covenant, could still be accepted into full church membership upon declaring themselves to be assured of saving faith. But by the end of the seventeenth century it was clear that the churches would soon be emptied of visible saints, mainly because halfway members lacked the assurance required for full standing in the church.'<br /><br />In response to this problem, Solomon Stoddard went beyond the Halfway Covenant and admitted his whole congregation to the Lord's Supper - not simply those who could claim assurance of saving faith. In the Reforming Synod of 1679 Stoddard had got the Synod to say that a \\"profession\\" of faith, not a convincing narrative of a conversion experience, should be required of applicants for full church membership. Eventually Stoddard took his doctrine one step more and admitted to the Supper anyone who wished to receive the Sacrament. In his hands the Supper became a \\"means\\" to assurance, which was seen by some as a falling away from the fundamental truths of Congregational polity that the Halfway Covenant had been designed to reinforce. In time, however, even those who thought the Halfway Covenant too lax came to see that the practice of the founders had been too rigid, and so reduced the procedure to a short \\"Confession of Faith,\\" endorsed by the Reforming Synod of 1680. Visible piety replaced evidence of sanctification, and piety itself came to have new meaning. Yet the need for assurance of salvation remained an issue, which by the 1740 s came to a head in the period of the Great Awakening. At no other time in New England's history was the matter so urgently discussed. No other facet of Reformed spirituality so dominated the written expression of the interior life. What is more, from the onset of Independence through the early national period assurance remained a controversial issue that continued to shape New England spiritual life.<br /><br />In the chapters that follow an effort has been made to discuss certain episodes in history as they relate to the doctrine of assurance. It is not intended here to make sweeping generalizations about the doctrine; nor is a comprehensive survey implied. Rather, the intent is to focus on persons and events that illustrate the issues involved. Accordingly, for the first period of settlement both Thomas Hooker and John Cotton serve to show how opposing views of the doctrine led to controversy and strife - paving the way for events to come. Then, for the era of the Great Awakening, Jonathan Edwards and the missionary David Brainerd act as spokesmen for a time when the doctrine gained a position more central than ever before. Finally, for the early national period, William Ellery Channing and Horace Bushnell speak for an era in which the doctrine appeared to be on the wane, yet once again remained a vital issue, not only for orthodox Congregationalists but also for \\"Liberal Christians,\\" who felt the need to redefine the doctrines from the past.\\"<br /><br />At first, however, the roots of the doctrine cannot be ignored; for without some understanding of beginnings there can be no understanding of later events. In the first chapter, therefore, both conforming and nonconforming churchmen are cited for early views of the doctrine. Both speak for English divinity on the eve of colonization; both must come to terms with Luther's and Calvin's thought. Indeed, the degree to which the doctrine of assurance owed its origins to Luther, compounded by the growing influence of Calvin, must be the starting point for any understanding of New England spiritual life.<br /><br />The basis of Luther's stand, which set the tone for the first phase of the English Reformation, was the doctrine of Justification by Faith alone, or solifidianism. This doctrine Luther based upon the epistles of Paul, notably Romans 4:5, \\"to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.\\" Faith alone, not works, Luther maintained, is the only road to salvation. This doctrine then passed to the first generation of English Protestants, where it received even fuller development. In time, however, it came under fire, notably in The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a Christian Man (1543), written by Thomas Cranmer and three other bishops, which rejected Luther's doctrine in no uncertain terms. Man is not justified by faith alone; nor is the righteousness of Christ \\"imputed\\" to man, as Luther imagined. Rather, man wins justification not only by faith but also by hope, charity, fear of God, and repentance. Because justification means \\"the making of us righteous before God,\\" it implies a life-long effort, not a sudden leap of faith alone. What is more, a man may lose it by sin, and no man may have \\"assurance\\" of his own salvation. In The Necessary Doctrine, which became known as The King's Book, works have a role in the scheme of justification and salvation; but by works, the authors write, we mean \\"all inward and spiritual works . . . as the fear of God, joy in God, godly meditations and thoughts, patience, humility and such like.\\" In later years, after the King's death, Cranmer confessed that he had gone too far in catering to Henry's Catholicism; but he had not complained while the King lived and had sanctioned his Book for use.<br /><br />Cranmer, moreover, had not been the first to take the doctrine to task. Erasmus, in Freedom of the Will (1524), had also stressed the liberty of man in relation to God. Citing Origen, Erasmus upheld man's cooperation with divine grace in order to gain salvation. He also cited 1 Tim. 2:4, \\"It is the will of God that all men shall be saved,\\" as a stimulant to human effort. (Luther had neglected those texts that diminished his own stand.) But if Erasmus did not treat Luther with great severity, Luther responded with force, writing in The Bondage of the Will (1525) that the Church Fathers who upheld the theory of free will were no more faithful to Scripture than Erasmus. Still, for Erasmus, belief in free will did not entail a denial of grace, and on this point he anticipated Cranmer. \\"I see Lutherans,\\" Erasmus wrote, \\"but I see nothing of the Gospel about them . . . I am of no mind to die for the paradoxes of Luther . . . whether free will contributed to salvation, whether any work of man can be called good . . . whether faith alone confers salvation . . . I would hope to be a martyr for Christ if I have the strength. I am not willing to be a martyr for Luther.\\"'\\" Yet Erasmus sympathized with Luther on \\"works,\\" or observances. For most of the faithful, Erasmus knew, salvation was assured through the accumulation of observances, without any concern for the conversion of the heart; and on this point he backed Luther's stand. On this point, moreover, he anticipated views that soon took hold in English soil. Erasmus, who lived at Cambridge in 1511 while at work on his Greek New Testament, wished to tame the extremes of solifidianism - setting an example for others of like mind.<br /><br />In the hands of Calvin, however, Luther's doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone received substantial development. Calvin, in an effort to bring heightened spirituality to the Reformation, not only stressed Luther's solifidianism but also the notion that man is predestined to salvation or damnation by God's sovereign will, a teaching even Paul himself had left undeveloped. From 1540, when English Protestantism made a shift from its original Lutheran inspiration, the influence of Geneva steadily increased; and, as a result, Calvin's stress on Justification by Faith Alone, with its concomitant doctrine of assurance, came more and more to the fore. Still, for some English Protestants Calvin was seen as merely one of many Reformers. As foreign influences onthe English Reformation strengthened, English divines looked to Bucer of Strassburg or Bullinger of Z&uuml;rich as much as they looked to Geneva, so that the history of English divinity must be seen as coming increasingly under the sway of a broader spectrum of Reformed thought.\\" While the Genevan spirit dominated English Protestantism, especially at Cambridge during Elizabeth's reign, attacks on Calvin, notably on his doctrine of assurance, also prevailed, so that the question of whether or not a man could be assured of his salvation had fully to be taken into account. Should the pronouncements of Luther and Calvin be taken as final?<br /><br />Lutherans and Calvinists, to be sure, offered an attractive solution to the problem of assurance, mainly because they stressed the Pauline doctrine of Justification by faith alone. Indeed, those who objected to the doctrine failed to understand its appeal to suffering souls for whom the weight of observances was too much to carry. At the same time, however, Genevan radicalism, in its attempt to pull the English Church in that direction, had failed to understand the conservative tastes of the early English Reformers, such as Cramer, who by the end of Edward VI's reign had bequeathed to the Elizabethan era a liturgy too attractive to be displaced by full-fledged patterns of Genevan thought. In effect, because Cranmer had preserved some Catholic elements in both the 1549 and the 1552 Prayer Books, he gave a distinctive flavour to English divinity that would continue to influence both \\"conformists\\" and \\"nonconformists\\" alike.<br /><br />The authorities of Calvinist Cambridge, nevertheless, fell with anger upon those who questioned the doctrine of assurance; only on the death of Elizabeth were efforts made to recover the tradition that Cranmer had established in his time. Churchmen such as Richard Hooker (with Cranmer's Prayer Book in mind) made every effort to mitigate the rigours of the Genevan spirit. At the same time, however, nonconformist preachers tended to enhance that spirit, so that what came to be called \\"Puritanism\\" was associated with the doctrine of assurance. But \\"Puritans\\" themselves differed on the nature of the doctrine, as did conforming churchmen. What our texts reveal is that the term \\"Puritanism\\" should not be limited to nonconformists. As a powerful element in the origins of the English church, it belongs to the Reformation. Indeed, when the national church took its stand upon the principles of the Reformation, \\"Puritans\\" loomed large amongst its members: there were \\"conforming Puritans\\" as well as \\"nonconforming Puritans\\" throughout the early years. It was not until after the establishment of the church under Laud, in the reign of Charles I, that the term \\"Anglicanism\\" became applicable. Such early nonconformist pastors as William Perkins, Richard Rogers, and Arthur Hildersam preached within the same tradition as Lancelot Andrewes and John Donne. It was a tradition to beassessed in terms of the influence of Reformed theology on the English clergy, both conformists and nonconformists alike.'<br /><br/>For this reason the terms \\"conformist\\" and \\"nonconformist\\" most accurately describe those who made up the preaching body of the Church throughout the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. \\"Conformists\\" tended to abide by the rules of ritual and subscribe to the Prayer Book, while \\"nonconformists\\" took great liberties with set prayers or refused to wear the surplice; but even within the nonconformist fold the spirit of English divinity was moving toward patterns of thinking incompatible with strict Genevan thought. Although nonconformists have been criticized for their insensitivity to sacramental values, their preoccupation with predestinarian thought, and their stress on assurance of personal salvation, what our texts reveal is that even the dictates of Luther and Calvin would not be taken as final by those who wished to advance the nonconformist cause. As we shall see, some not only upheld sacramental values but also adjusted the doctrine of assurance to fit their needs; and those who did would give form and shape to New England spiritual life.<br /><br />The concern for one's estate in grace, which took hold in New England, was based on the possibility of assurance. As opposed to Roman Catholics, who rejected the notion of assurance of salvation, nonconformists in New England maintained that certitude of salvation can be known; the possibility of knowing one's estate set the tone. But it soon led to the question of how God's work may be recognized. How does the Spirit work? Was assurance the work of a gracious human spirit, linked by obedience to the conditional promises in Scripture, or was assurance a work of the Holy Spirit - speaking directly to the soul? For those who followed Reformed orthodoxy generally, the process for trying one's estate fell within the natural human capacity for reflection. For others, human works were not permitted as a ground for assurance, no matter how enlightened by regenerating grace; for grace that is subject to reflection is different from grace that is given immediately by the Holy Spirit. The New England dispute involved the relation of nature and grace. Thereafter, classic New England divinity sought to embrace divine activity and created nature. Even so - well into the nineteenth century - New Englanders were worried by the problem of assurance of salvation: the important religious experience was that of being chosen; the fear was that of being left out. The urgent need was to find signs of assurance of grace.<br /><br />What should it mean to have assurance that follows justification by faith? Should assurance mean a firm \\"security,\\" or the lesser surety of one's inner \\"certainty,\\" or no reliable certainty of any kind, but only a continuing struggle for the grace that indicates election? Could one take the outward evidence of \\"sanctification\\" - leading a religious life - to mean that Christhad redeemed, or justified one's soul? These questions, which gained importance in New England, had their origins in the old world, where \\"Calvinists\\" of various kinds struggled to impose their views, sometimes on Calvin himself, and often with startling results. As we shall see, the cast of characters is not small; but each made a contribution of his own, and each left a mark on doctrinal history that would determine the course of New England spiritual life.o tame the extremes of solifidianism - setting an example for others of like mind. <br />In the hands of Calvin, however, Luther's doctrine of Justification by Faith Alone received substantial development. Calvin, in an effort to bring heightened spirituality to the Reformation, not only stressed Luther's solifidianism but also the notion that man is predestined to salvation or damnation by God's sovereign will, a teaching even Paul himself had left undeveloped. From 1540, when English Protestantism made a shift from its original Lutheran inspiration, the influence of Geneva steadily increased; and, as a result, Calvin's stress on Justification by Faith Alone, with its concomitant doctrine of assurance, came more and more to the fore.

But \\"Puritans\\" themselves differed on the nature of the doctrine, as did conforming churchmen. What our texts reveal is that the term \\"Puritanism\\" should not be limited to nonconformists. As a powerful element in the origins of the English church, it belongs to the Reformation. Indeed, when the national church took its stand upon the principles of the Reformation, \\"Puritans\\" loomed large amongst its members: there were \\"conforming Puritans\\" as well as \\"nonconforming Puritans\\" throughout the early years. It was not until after the establishment of the church under Laud, in the reign of Charles I, that the term \\"Anglicanism\\" became applicable. Such early nonconformist pastors as William Perkins, Richard Rogers, and Arthur Hildersam preached within the same tradition as Lancelot Andrewes and John Donne. It was a tradition to beassessed in terms of the influence of Reformed theology on the English clergy, both conformists and nonconformists alike.' <br />For this reason the terms \\"conformist\\" and \\"nonconformist\\" most accurately describe those who made up the preaching body of the Church throughout the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. \\"Conformists\\" tended to abide by the rules of ritual and subscribe to the Prayer Book, while \\"nonconformists\\" took great liberties with set prayers or refused to wear the surplice; but even within the nonconformist fold the spirit of English divinity was moving toward patterns of thinking incompatible with strict Genevan thought. Although nonconformists have been criticized for their insensitivity to sacramental values, their preoccupation with predestinarian thought, and their stress on assurance of personal salvation, what our texts reveal is that even the dictates of Luther and Calvin would not be taken as final by those who wished to advance the nonconformist cause. As we shall see, some not only upheld sacramental values but also adjusted the doctrine of assurance to fit their needs; and those who did would give form and shape to New England spiritual life. <br />The concern for one's estate in grace, which took hold in New England, was based on the possibility of assurance. As opposed to Roman Catholics, who rejected the notion of assurance of salvation, nonconformists in New England maintained that certitude of salvation can be known; the possibility of knowing one's estate set the tone. But it soon led to the question of how God's work may be recognized. How does the Spirit work? Was assurance the work of a gracious human spirit, linked by obedience to the conditional promises in Scripture, or was assurance a work of the Holy Spirit - speaking directly to the soul? For those who followed Reformed orthodoxy generally, the process for trying one's estate fell within the natural human capacity for reflection. For others, human works were not permitted as a ground for assurance, no matter how enlightened by regenerating grace; for grace that is subject to reflection is different from grace that is given immediately by the Holy Spirit. The New England dispute involved the relation of nature and grace. Thereafter, classic New England divinity sought to embrace divine activity and created nature. Even so - well into the nineteenth century - New Englanders were worried by the problem of assurance of salvation: the important religious experience was that of being chosen; the fear was that of being left out. The urgent need was to find signs of assurance of grace. <br />What should it mean to have assurance that follows justification by faith? Should assurance mean a firm \\"security,\\" or the lesser surety of one's inner \\"certainty,\\" or no reliable certainty of any kind, but only a continuing struggle for the grace that indicates election? Could one take the outward evidence of \\"sanctification\\" - leading a religious life - to mean that Christhad redeemed, or justified one's soul? These questions, which gained importance in New England, had their origins in the old world, where \\"Calvinists\\" of various kinds struggled to impose their views, sometimes on Calvin himself, and often with startling results. As we shall see, the cast of characters is not small; but each made a contribution of his own, and each left a mark on doctrinal history that would determine the course of New England spiritual life.	2005-01-14

A writer of immense intelligence, irony and wit, \\"SK\\" (as Walter Lowrie his biographer and one of his principal English translators refers to him) wrote many books in his short life, leaving to posterity a vast, fecund seam of critical insights and tools for further thought. In this he laid the foundations for several highly significant critical philosophies, notably the Existentialism of writers such as Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers and Jean-Paul Sartre, but also, by what is indeed a very circuitous twist, the perplexing, recursive complexities of what is loosely known as Postmodern or Poststructuralist thought.<br /><br />With respect to Existentialism the legacy is securely and vigorously affirmed. Much of Kierkegaard's reputation rests upon this connection and there is nothing to be gained by denying (should one wish to emphasise other aspects of his contribution) the phenomenal importance of this writer's influence upon the history of western thought. But Kierkegaard's practice as a radically innovative writer, an inventor of dialogic, interrogative forms has also left its startling, pensive trace upon a generation of thinkers whose philosophical positions are very far from that occupied by Kierkegaard himself and in conflict with the implicit and now somewhat laboured tenets of Existentialism. Kierkegaard's adoption of a diversity of pseudonyms, masks through which to disseminate a wide range of conflicting points of view are what is pertinent here, paralleling as these devices do the questioning of single subject positions that is - this refutation of a presumed singularity of position - a common feature of Postmodernist<br /><br />writing, as well as of its equivalent within the visual arts. To write a passionately argued tract in which a clearly defined line of thought is developed, following this with one ostensibly produced by another author but which is in fact by the person it appears to attack, as Kierkegaard had occasion to do, is a rhetorical device more readily associated with the self-consciousness of post-1960s European thought than with Denmark in the first half of the nineteenth century. Kierkegaard's writing markedly transcends the body of works it so vividly helped to spawn, taking on a new relevance for readers encountering it in the present age.<br /><br />Considering this long-term relevance of this philosophy and its pertinence in new and unpredictable cultures and contexts should help the reader of Scott Koterbay's book on Kierkegaard's elusive yet highly provocative \\"aesthetic theories\\" understand why the former's study is of such importance today. In examining in detail Kierkegaard's comprehensive, if elusive philosophy this book not only provides the reader with a subtle account of the major components of this great thinker's work, but moves forward to look at important aspects of the Dane's understanding of art and the aesthetic which have not previously been attended to with such, perspicacious, involved attention.<br /><br />Kierkegaard's writings are usually seen as having three distinct stages or areas of import: the aesthetic, the ethical and the religious. The former two are first put forward in the seminal work Either/Or of 1843. As Ronald Grimsley succinctly puts it: \\"Whereas the aesthetic personality remains disastrously turned in upon itself, refusing to acknowledge any higher possibility to its existence than an absorption in its own feelings and emotions, the ethical individual identifies himself with the existence of his fellow<br /><br />men, actively sharing in their moral needs and aspirations.\\"<br /><br />Extending out from, but well beyond the ethical stage is that of the religious or Christian, which involves humankind's relation with the absolute. Koterbay has much to say on this facet of Kierkegaard's stance as a religious thinker and about how art, in a somewhat inverted manner, engages with it.<br /><br />Beginning with an outline and critique of Kierkegaard's highly idiosyncratic theory of the individual, of the self as he defines it as the kernel of a philosophical \\"system\\" whose central beliefs involve the mapping out of theological world view of which the self is but one - although a very necessary - component, Koterbay goes on to unpick the intricacies of Kierkegaard's notion of art. To focus upon art in this way is to take a most unorthodox position vis-a-vis conventional approaches to Kierkegaard, which by and large may be divided into two distinct branches or schools. For one group of scholars, Kierkegaard is important as the founder of Existentialism and this philosophical position in relation to his life and writings is ceaselessly researched, examined and turned over, as though it were the only seam of his work that might be productively perused or which opened up issues that would seriously be taken up in future studies. As for the second \\"school\\" or approach, the attention here is upon Kierkegaard's position as a Christian philosopher. What is important about Koterbay's essay is that it breaks this mould, shifting the terms of the discussion to a different field of operation. In this, Koterbay somewhat resembles Kierkegaard himself, an outsider figure when placed in relation to the prominent intellectual debates of his day. Koterbay is working to extend the frame of specialist research on his chosen subject, an activity which, in the first instance \\"merely\\" expands the body of information about and the lines of approach to Kierkegaard, and in the second, revitalises and realigns the broader understanding of the subject at hand. One is reminded of the so-called \\"affair of the Corsair\\" of 1846, a tempestuous exchange between Kierkegaard and several of his contemporaries in and around the aforementioned satirical publication, though exactly how Koterbay's work on Kierkegaard's relation to art will be received by other scholars remains to be seen. Koterbay's tract is nonetheless a polemical one and will surely provoke much discussion among interested parties.<br /><br />Furthermore, this zooming in upon the place of art in Kierkegaard's oeuvre is more than a merely pedantic or personal concern of its author, for the state of art and of the aesthetic is, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, by no means untroubled or securely located. In fact quite the opposite might be claimed for this scurrilous branch of philosophy and practice. Postmodernism is at one level a dissolution of the certainties we once thought we held, and art, at least since Hegel, has been subjected to a still continuing series of doubts and attacks, which, having reached a new intensity in our own day, remain to plague us. At a time when the practice of art seems stronger and more prominent within western culture than perhaps at any other time the value of art, its validity - even the possibility of it being a meaningful and effective force at all - remains in question. In Kierkegaard's philosophy art is already subjected to an act of productive disregard, an account, rather, of its flaccid promise in relation to the critical task at hand. In spite of Kierkegaard castigating art for its failings, for its apparent uselessness, his work ultimately, as Koterbay notes in Chapter 6, fails to fully attend to it: \\"...the authentic artist is a communicator of the ideal, but in what sense? Therein lies the question of the actual nature of the authentic artist in Kierkegaard's thought, one which he himself did not explicate.\\"<br /><br />Koterbay picks up and examines at length what he calls in Chapter 8 \\"the ambiguous and difficult position that the art object occupies within Kierkegaard's writings\\". He gives us the critical case against art as a necessary prerequisite to outlining how art and the aesthetic are perceived by later thinkers whose work has been important for contemporary discussions of the subject. In doing this, Koterbay has looked in great depth at a much disregarded factor in Kierkegaard's<br /><br />world view, one which, as this volume makes vividly clear, is well worth the attention which up until the present work it has all too sorely lacked. Koterbay's book is thus not only a major contribution to an important but maligned and misunderstood element of Kierkegaardian philosophy but is also an attempt to show its relevance to the situation today. Contemporary art and its related discussion parties cannot but benefit from such a work. One thing surely absent from many of today's debates around art, both at the theoretical and practical levels, is some means of realigning notions of authorship and selfhood with the work of art itself. Kierkegaard's approach offers one such proposition, and even if we may feel that times have radically changed and not all the pieces of Kierkegaard's philosophical model are to our taste or understanding, his provocative picture of the impossible possibility of the aesthetic as expounded by Scott Koterbay, gives us a much needed theoretical, critical, and ultimately pragmatic insight into problems that require, in our own time, to be urgently and most assiduously addressed.<br /><br />Peter Suchin<br /><br />Peter Suchin is an art critic and artist.

As this technology expands in popularity and application, industry experts must grasp the fundamental principles behind it, its strengths, and its limitations. A basic reference on the benefits of microarray technology in drug discovery, this publication offers a detailed perspective and insight into the present and future uses of this technology.<br /><br />Features<br /><br />Includes an extensive literature survey and comparison of microarray technology formats<br /><br />Discusses the relevance and general utility of microarray technologies in the drug discovery process<br /><br />Provides an in-depth discussion of important factors for successful array printing Contains protocols for printing nucleic acids and proteins and a selection of substrates and preparation of surface chemistries<br /><br />Supplies an extensive review and assessment of key studies demonstrating the utility of gene expression and protein microarrays<br /><br />Array technology, much like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was created to satisfy an existing need in molecular biology. PCR provided a means to amplify enough DNA to sequence genes. The first applications for arrays involved gene sequencing by hybridization (SBH) and genotyping. However, gel-based sequencing quickly supplanted the emerging SBH approach, while genotyping and mutation analysis have been slow in development. The challenge for those involved in array technology then became finding that elusive application niche, one that would demonstrate a clear, unmitigated, and thereby sustained need for the technology.<br /><br />This book picks up the array technology journey from the mid-1990s with the introduction of microarray-based gene expression analysis. The global analysis of genes by microarrays has provided a fresh and exciting view of the cellular process. More importantly, it enabled others to consider similar utility in various \\"omic\\" fields. Hence, we have witnessed the emergence of protein arrays to address proteomics.<br /><br />In writing this book, my aim was first to provide a detailed description and offer insight into present and future utilities for microarray technology. While arguably array-based technologies are now being adopted in diverse fields, I have placed emphasis on applications related to drug discovery. Microarrays continue to play significant and increasingly important roles in the drug discovery process.<br /><br />Chapter 1 considers the respective roles as well as the many issues surrounding the future adoption of gene expression and protein microarrays for pharmacogenomic and pharmacoproteomic applications. For acceptance by the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries, commercially validated array technology is required. Chapter 2 details the commercial microarray landscape. Chapter 3 describes alternative substrates and the preparation of various surface chemistries along with their suitability for immobilization of nucleic acids and proteins. In Chapter 4, the mechanics of microarraying are described in detail including environmental conditions, printer and pin performance, and instructions for setting up a print run. Protocols for printing nucleic acids and proteins are provided along with in-depth discussion of other important parameters such as print buffers (inks) and factors influencing print quality. I also set out to discuss the importance and providea critical assessment of studies that helped to define applications in genomics and proteomics. In Chapter 5, gene expression microarray applications are described; Chapter 6 examines the utility of protein microarrays.<br /><br />Finally, an understanding of the making of a microarray is fundamentally important to those interested in producing \\"spotted\\" arrays and properly using them.

The Heart is the place where opposites converge: Logos and Eros; masculine and feminine; thinking and feeling; the rationality of the ego and the irrationality of the unconscious. It possesses its own knowledge and its own truth. This truth is distinct from the truth of the mind while also containing it. The Heart is the seat of conscience, understanding, forgiveness, grace, and our ethical attitude; it is the place of dialogue. In the Heart, we can be in the ethical attitude of holding both polarities until the new attitude appears.<br /><br />This book is an inquiry into philosophical and spiritual aspects of individuation's ethical dimensions. Specifically, these aspects are viewed in the context of people actively engaged in their process and in the practice of analytical psychology. The book is aimed at clients and patients wishing to understand how to live an ethical life when confronted with the amorality of the unconscious and the ethical conflicts of duty that arise. Becker also addresses analysts, therapists, and those in training by providing a framework for thinking and reflecting on these issues. The work spans many aspects of this complicated topic: Is morality learned or is it innate? How do we live in the world ethically, authentically, and with integrity? What is the distinction between the individual \\"Voice of God\\" and collective ethical codes? and How do we live this tension in our lives and in day-to-day practice as analysts? Finally, how do we confront the Shadow in individuals and collectives and bring these elements to consciousness?<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts. The first part looks at individuation as an ethical process as Jung understood it. Included in this examination are Jung's philosophical influences and personal experiences, which informed his belief that morality is innate in human beings and rests at the archetypal level of the psyche. These explorations also present a classical notion of analytical psychology within the philosophical and psychological contexts of ethics, morality, and conscience. They offer insights into the underpinnings of Jung's theories and ideas. Particular moral and ethical challenges are highlighted-especially related to conscience and the ethical confrontation with the unconscious.<br /><br />The second part of the book addresses more collective, twenty-first-century implications of Jung's ideas of the \\"Voice of God\\". It also explores contemporary issues related to the practice of analytic psychology, given the legacy of Jung's personal relationships with his clients. While supporting individual subjective psychic experience, analysts can side with the psyche to the neglect of collective ethical codes. As a result, many analysts have committed serious boundary violations, all in the name of following the \\"Voice of God\\" or the Self. In recent years, the Jungian community has come to the unanimous agreement that sexual activity between analyst and analysand represents a serious rupture in the analytic relationship. However, between the obvious inappropriateness of sexual activity and the institution of strict, rigid rules prohibiting any crossing of analytic boundaries, there exists a field where there are no hard and fast rules, and where the line between ethical and unethical behavior is difficult to distinguish. It is possible for an analyst to adhere strictly to collective codes of ethics prescribed by governing bodies and still behave unethically. In this space, the subject of ethics is a much more delicate and ambiguous endeavor. Most of the issues that arise within this area involve non-sexual boundary violations.<br /><br />As part of this discussion, Becker examines the archetypal foundations of analytic boundaries and the important role they play in supporting individuation as an ethical process-for both analyst and analysand. Becker argues that the therapeutic relationship has an archetypal core that informs our experience of analysis. The constellation of the Divine Healer with its potential to heal also brings with it the potential for the Charlatan and the False Prophet to wound. Central questions within this dynamic are: What is the difference between flexibility and violation? When is the crossing of the boundary experienced as healing by the analysand? When is it experienced as wounding? Case material is provided, which presents both sides of this issue. Becker has also included the results of a survey she prepared as part of the research for her Diploma Thesis at the C.G. Jung Institute in Z&uuml;rich. In it, I asked practicing analysts (members of the IAAP) how they lived the tension between individual conscience and collective moral codes in their daily practice. In conclusion, Becker looks at suffering and the ethical attitudes required to live individuation as an ethical process in everyday life and in practice.elationship has an archetypal core that informs our experience of analysis.

Mullen (University of Minnesota Press) Chapter 1 of Afro-Orientalism retells the evolution of the political and cultural thought of W. E. B. Du Bois through examination of his life-long body of work on Asia. Du Bois viewed the relationship between the modern and ancient worlds of Asia and Africa as a dialectical site of struggle for the future of the races of men. It was also the testing ground for most of his internal struggles with concepts of culture, nationalism, racial authenticity, and, toward the end of his life, Marxism. The evolution of Du Bois's ideas regarding Africa and its role in the Western world is also incomprehensible, this chapter argues, without careful attention to his analysis of Asia as its fraternal twin in global struggle. Particularly in his 1928 novel Dark Princess, long out of print but now rightfully restored to prominence by the University Press of Mississippi, Du Bois provided a map of Afro-Asian relations predictive of much of the twentieth century that followed.<br /><br />Chapter 2 examines in tandem Richard Wright's exiled writings on Asia and Africa. The chapter argues that Wright's fraught and shifting analyses of race, and Marxism, reflect his conception of himself as \\"Outsider,\\" a figure transcending the entirety of his career but most clearly understandable in his writings on colonialism. This same figure can be described as a figure for the Orientalist. Wright's unresolved relation-ship to Western modernity and a Western epistemology superseded his early commitment to historical materialism. As he moved further from the citadel of Western empire, he was ironically drawn back to its telos and epistemology as a way to assess the non-Western world. This led Wright into essentialist judgments and hostile conceptions of both raceand historical materialism. It also eliminated the possibility of a dialectical resolution of themes in his writing. The chapter contends that Wright's exiled writings of the 1950s thus constitute a key chapter not only in his career but in the career of Afro-Asian thought and exchange, particularly on the question of colonialism.<br /><br />Chapter 3 documents forms of political and cultural correspondence practiced among Afro-Asian radicals during the so-called Bandung era from 1955 to 1973. Black American radicals and cultural workers in Detroit constructed imaginative forms of solidarity with Third World struggles in Asian countries by forging internationalist links through intertextual strategies of exchange. A crucial conduit for this process was the fugitive NAACP organizer Robert F. Williams. During his exile to Cuba and China from 1961 to 1969, Williams became a literal and figurative correspondent for sympathetic internationalists in Asia and black America. Much of the cultural work produced under the Black Arts movement rubric in Detroit also found direct inspiration in Mao's famous Yenan Forum address on the arts, and more generally in the example of China's Cultural Revolution. This chapter will explore the strategy of transnational correspondence as a means of building a dialectical Afro-Asian exchange across continents, and redefining notions of East and West by rethinking the political geography of cities like Detroit.<br /><br />Chapter 4 makes a careful examination of the evolution in political thought of the most significant Afro-Asian collaboration in U.S. radical history, the marriage of James and Grace Lee Boggs. Architects of and participants in some of the most vital grassroots political organizing of the twentieth century, the Boggses' work stands at the crossroads of important Marxist and anticolonial writings attempting to synthesize in particular the struggles of Afro-Asians as \\"people of color\\" and representatives of the world proletariat. Beginning with their work with the Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, up through their serious study and use of Maoist theory during the Black Power movement, the Boggses consistently used a dialectical comprehension of race and class-and, to-ward the latter stages of their careers, gender-to fashion a fundamentally Marxian theory of liberation. Even in moments of contention and disavowal, their durable theory of \\"dialectical humanism\\" has remained faithful to the premises of Marx and Engels's assessment of colonialism and racism as the brute forces underpinning the exploitation of the majority of the world's citizens.

Ho describes his own radical hybridity as guerrilla theater, or what I call trickster jazz. It summons up linguistic, musical, and political touchstones of subversion and liberation from Afro-Asian culture and deploys them in the service of a revolutionary vanguardism beyond the boundaries of mainstream taste and consumer culture.

A member of the Islamic Brotherhood, he was jailed by Gamal Abdul Nasser's government as early as 1954. He became one of the most uncompromising voices of the movement we now call Islamism and is best known perhaps for his book, Ma'lam fi al-tariq (Milestones, 1965), after publication of which he was accused of conspiring against Egyptian president Nasser and arrested. He was executed in 1966.<br /><br />This memoir tells of Qutb's childhood in the village of Musha in Upper Egypt. Qutb documents the era between 1912 and 1918, a time immensely influencial in the creation of modern Egypt. Written with much tenderness toward childhood memories, it has become a classic in modern Arabic autobiography. Qutb offers a clear picture of Egyptian village life in the early twentieth century, its customs and lore, educational system, religious festivals, relations with the central government, and the struggle to modernize and retain its identity. In their rendering of the work into English, translators John Calvert and William Shepard capture the beauty and intensity of Qutb's prose.<br /><br />A Child from the Village was written just prior to Qutb's conversion to the Islamist cause and reflects his concerns for social justice. Interest in Qutb's writing has increased in the West since Islamism has emerged as a power on the world scene.<br /><br />message. Despite its tone of nostalgia, A Child from the Village paints a picture of the Egyptian countryside that is not entirely happy. The specter of peasant indebtedness and loss of land haunts the pages of the autobiography, as does disease caused by unhygienic conditions and the peasants' recourse to folk remedies and barber-surgeons rather than scientifically trained physicians. The joys of Ramadan, birth ceremonies, and other festive occasions are juxtaposed to death, tragedy, and the laments of women whose families patiently endure hard lives. Captives of poverty and ignorance, the peasants of Qutb's autobiography toil endlessly in their fields with little expectation that their lives will improve. They are the victims of the few large landowners and politicians who controlled Egypt's wealth. According to Tetz Rooke, who examined a wide range of Arabic childhood autobiographies, the critical portrayal of rural life found A Child from the Village represents a \\"break with the tendency towards pastoral idealization which dominated much of the first Egyptian creative writing concerned with country life.\\" lt may thus be seen as a \\"precursor of the later Egyptian novel that embraces the subject of the village with a true-to-life, descriptive intent such as al-Ard [The earth, 1953] by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sharqawi (1920-1987).\\"4 In the context of the mid-1940s, Qutb's book manifests a growing awareness among Egypt's intelligentsia of socioeconomic issues. It was during this period, for example, that dissident elements within the Wafd founded the Wafdist Vanguard in order to influence the party leadership in a leftist direction.<br /><br />Implicitly and sometimes explicitly in the book, Qutb advocates the need for reform and modernization at the village level. Qutb believed that the introduction of modern schooling in Musha was a step in the right direction, but he also believed that there was need for many more improvements, especially in the areas of land reform and health care. In his view, the Egyptian government was the obvious agent to undertake the necessary reforms, but too often the state's ameliorative efforts were imposed with a heavy hand or else were ill conceived. Qutb provides a harrowing account of a government operation, probably staged shortly after World War I, to confiscate all weapons belonging to the villagers of Asyut Province as a precondition for its integration into the structure of the State on a more thorough basis. He describes how soldiers, having surrounded the village, brutally interrogated the peasants, at one point firing bullets over the heads of the assembled village elders. Events such as this reinforced the peasants' traditional distrust of a governmental authority that in the past periodically subjected them to corv&eacute;e labor. Elsewhere in the book, Qutb documents, sometimes with humor, the unwelcome and often inexpert intrusions of various government officials into the affairs of the community. We are introduced to medical officials, coroners, judges, and others, all of whom attempt to order and police the countryside in ways that make sense to the State but not to the villagers. In much the same way as the Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim's novella Diary of a Country Prosecutor, A Child from the Village documents the gulf in understanding that existed between urban officialdom and the dwellers of the countryside, the difference being that in Qutb's book we are provided with the perspective of the peas-ants rather than that of a government official. Qutb appears to argue that if modernization in Egypt's countryside is to be effective, it must take into account the sensibilities and social and economic realities of its inhabitants.<br /><br />Within two years of the publication of A Child from the Village, Qutb adopted the Islamist position upon which his fame rests. Whatever the exact reasons for his ideological change, the significant point is that Qutb's early Islamist writings display many of the same basic concerns for social justice and national community that figure in his secular writings, including A Child from the Village. A discussion of the ways in which Qutb grafted the symbols and doctrines of the Qur'an is beyond the scope of this introduction. What can be said is that A Child from the Village illuminates an important element of the context out of which Qutb's Islamism emerged.ccount of a government operation, probably staged shortly after World War I, to confiscate all weapons belonging to the villagers of Asyut Province as a precondition for its integration into the structure of the State on a more thorough basis.

Psychohistorical Arguments Maybe!	A New Midrashic Reading Of Geoffrey Chaucer His Life And Works by Norman Toby Simms (Studies in British Literature: Edwin Mellen Press) Excerpt: After completing my study of Sir Gawain and the Knight of the Green Chapel, I feel there is a similar context in which Chaucer has to be fitted into if we are to appreciate more fully the uniqueness of his poetry, as well as the way his work relates to the traditions and precedents available to him during the fourteenth century in England and the rest of Western Europe. These other contexts, as I showed in that earlier book, are those of the Jewish heritage left behind after the formal expulsions in the late thirteenth century, as well as the Crypto-Jewish or Marrano context of those persons who remained hidden after 1290 or returned over the next generation or who came from elsewhere in Europe, nor just to flee prosecution but to live a strange new kind of concealed and non-institutional Judaism. Once it is noticed that while organised rabbinical life in England had been abolished and no one could perform all the formal mitzvot required of Talmudic (or rabbinic or halachic) Judaism, the question arises of what else there is: and that question has many answers, some of them to be found in private, public, and courtly literature, including the new religious plays-Mysteries, Moralities and Miracles-many of which deal with Jews in such an ambiguous and complex way that the old argument that there were no Jews in England at that time or that no one knew anything about Judaism other than what was in the Bible as the fathers no longer holds much water. There were Jews about, albeit of a very fuzzy kind, and those fuzzy Jews were there in England as much in the audience as in a creative role. The strongest aspect to the new perspective is therefore that probably most of these fuzzy Jews did not know who they were and, if they did not outright reject the overt implications of their depiction of Jews and Judaism, at least show that they felt very uncomfortable with those developments.<br /><br />Does this mean that I believe Geoffrey Chaucer was himself a practicing Jew or at least a self-curious child of such halachic Jews-one or two generations from a forced or voluntary conversion by his parents or grandparents? In a way the answer is yes...but a \\"yes\\" with many qualifications. Before we can move towards any answers, and there are many different kinds of answer to be given, we have to move away from the simplistic dichotomy which assumes that either one is or one is not a Jew; and if one is a Jew, since the religion and the institutions of Judaism were outlawed in 1290, then there could have been no Jews in England at all, and so Chaucer could not have been a Jew: tout court. The whole history of the Sephardic persecutions and expulsions from the end of the fourteenth century onwards shows that such dichotomizing cannot work to trace the experiences of individuals and families. After the massacres of 1390 in Spain, a series of mass conversions followed, until almost half, at least, of all Sephardic Jews went into the baptismal fount. Given that at this time, too, the overwhelming majority of all Jews in the world were Sephardim, this was no isolated event, but one of the most profound demographic and cultural events before the twentieth century. Our task, though, is not so much to look at the repercussions of this traumatic transformation of world Jewry in the early modem period, but to see if there were specific antecedent events, small in their scope and impact, but nonetheless significant and paradigmatic of what was to follow.<br /><br />Can we, however, justify applying the lessons of this somewhat later period about the New Christians, Marranos, and escaped and returning Jews from Spain and Portugal to the situation in England a century earlier? Not if we are going to be rigid about it, or trip ourselves up on quibbles over the meaning of specific words like converso and Crypto-Jew. Iwill argue that there are analogies and that, once alerted to kinds of subtle distinctions to be found in the Spanish and Portuguese cases, we can start to find similar evidence in the fourteenth century and in Britain: as long as we keep reminding ourselves that similarities are not exact replicas or foreshadowing. This also means that we risk dealing with essentialist concepts, as though there were something specifically, innately, inalterably Jewish, despite historical and social differences, something that outlasts conscious religious and psychological beliefs about oneself or one's family and friends, in other words, a sort of genetic inalterability that can be sustained for several generations despite conversion and then isolation from, with consequent ignorance of, Jewish ways of thinking, perceiving the world, evaluating experience, and feeling about oneself and one's children. I will not argue simply that \\"the proof is in the pudding\\": that because Chaucer looks and sounds like a Jew in some of the postures he assumes and the judgments he makes in the course of his poetry he must be a Jew, whether he likes it or not, and even whether he knows it or not. But I will argue that in a more complex, and I hope a more sophisticated way. I will argue that Geoffrey was not as isolated or as alienated from Jews and Jewishness-although he was very probably alienated completely from Judaism as an organized, institutionalized and coherent religious practice-as would first seem from the usual assumptions made about England in his life time.<br /><br />The first qualification, then, is that, if Chaucer were such an offspring of English Marranos, he was in his beliefs and even in his heart a good Roman Catholic in the same way as the majority of the British men and women of the period, this majority consisting as much the aristocracy and the clergy as the crowds in the streets of towns and villages. The next qualification is that, despite his conscious beliefs as a Christian, he probably had reservations about the demonization and persecution of the Jews, taking a position closer to that of the high church officials who saw Jews as a necessary historical link to the Old Testament and the presence and events of the New Testament. Third, Chaucer-and a few others cosmopolitan intellectuals like himself in England-were aware that real Jews in Europe in the fourteenth century could not be unquestionably equated with either the Hebrews of the Old Testament or, in a somewhat more problematic sense, with the distorted caricatures in the New Testament, except perhaps in a sympathetic way with Jesus and the Holy Family and the band of the original disciples. Fourthly, thanks the journeys to and communications with Spain, Italy, France and other parts of Western Europe, Chaucer would have known at first hand about the real condition of Jews-their intellectual life centered on the Oral Torah and the performance of mitzvot, and the persecution at the hands of uneducated mobs, fanatical minor clergy, and cynical civil and royal officials. Fifth, not only does Chaucer in his poetry show a sympathy and understanding of the social difficulties of real Jews living in Western Europe under increasingly hostile conditions-the expulsion from England was just the beginning of the way cities and kingdom expelled the Jewish communities-but also demonstrates an understanding of peculiarly rabbinic ways of thinking and reading, including a familiarity with the mystical thought of systematic kabbalah being then written in Spain, Southern France, Italy, and parts of the Levant...<br /><br />Excerpt: This book is divided into three sections. In the first section, composed of Chapters 1 to 3, which might be called \\"All To-Tore\\", from an expression the Canon's Yeoman uses, I will examine the notion of both Chaucer's life and his works being \\"composed\\" in a process of fragmentation and disguise, and introduce the idea of midrash as a modem tool of literary exegesis. It might be possible to call this approach a particular kind of rabbinical aesthetic deriving from the kabbalistic notion of the breaking of the vessels, but at this stage in our discussion we can only survey the biography of the man and then, midrashically, find new contexts for him as an individual and as a type of New<br /><br />Christian living in England and serving his royal masters on the Continent. It is also important here to survey both the life of the author and the Chaucerian canon, searching for exemplary instances of the breaking apart of the text, the focus on gaps and non sequiturs, and the disappearance or displacement of themes, images, and structural elements within the various verse and prose documents. The primary text to be examined will be The Wyf of Bath's Prologue, Introduction and Tale from the Canterbury Tales, seeing it in relation to the concluding praise-poem to the Good Wife in the Book of Proverbs, credited to Lemuel rather than Solomon, and exploring its treatment of women, whether satirical social types or romantic ideals, or even figures of the biblical Queen Esther, later the precious saint of the Spanish and Portuguese Crypto-Jews, and the mystical figure of the Shekhina, the mystical shadow of God's presence and his consort whom he seeks while she lives with the Children of Israel in their long and painful exile. These first three chapters will also start to deal with a question of deafness, marked into the body and life of the Wyf of Bath as a physical injury, but evident throughout the author's life and throughout his works in several other senses: (1) a low-level defect in interpretation wherein what is heard is presumed to be all there is to know, with everything surrounding it fading into a kind of marginal static normally unperceived and unheard; (2) a higher degree of awareness that begins with a sense of gaps and lapses in the perceived and ordinarily experienced environment accompanied by attempts to fill in those points of silence and invisibility, holes and black-spots, through imaginative-symbolic, allusive and intuitive-insertions, supplements, displacements and recontextualizations; and (3) a very different order of interpretation, in which the earlier surface text, with its deformities and fragmentation, is understood as a texture composed of diverse languages simultaneously being played out and requiring new kinds of attention, intensities of focus, and coordination between logic and fantasy.<br /><br />The next two chapters, 4 and 5, form a second section that confronts head-on the problematic of Chaucer's alleged anti-Jewishness, particularly exemplified in the Prioress's Prologue and Tale also from the Canterbury Tales. I could name section \\"The Little Clergeon's Song\\" and sub-title it \\"What They Heard and Didn't Hear\\" because of the way the Latin hymn Alma Redemptoris Mater brings to the surface questions related to children, language, ritual murder and retributive collective punishment. Here, too, we must take time to weigh up the evidence for the way in which Jews are thought of, depicted, and perhaps recollected in a supposedly Judenrein England, as well as on the Continent where the Black Plague and other natural disasters provokes wave on wave of persecution and slander against the Jews. Where and how could a Crypto-Jewish presence be found in England at this time, and how would it be related to the communities under pressure and in exile elsewhere in western Europe? The Prioress's Tale, rather than a manifestation of the hate literature common to Spain, France, Italy and elsewhere, appears instead as a very intense and confused statement of faith by the nun who calls herself Eglantine: the setting of her little martyr's legend is displaced to Asia, where both Christians and Jews live as minorities subject to an unnamed Muslim ruler, its vicious slanders against the Jews do not include charges of ritual murder or the blood libel, and it presents a confusion of authorities both within and outside the fictional narrative itself, so much so that there seems to be a rationalization of the crime committed against the poor little Clergeon as he walks through the Jewish quarter of the city. Then, as we fold back this discussion and the Prioress' two texts her confessional Prologue and her pious Tale back over the Wyf of Bath, as another variant of an articulate woman with an ax to grind, the discussion leads us into a deeper exploration of how the midrashic aesthetic functions both as a means of Chaucer's creativity and our own optic of analysis; and further, how it relates the three dimensions of deafness mentioned before can help us understand the various generic categories radiated through the major works of Chaucer : particularly parody, satire, grotesque and cynical diatribe.<br /><br />Chapters 6-8 take as their central text is The Book of the Duchess-which may, by kabbalistic letter combinations, be termed the Sepher Chesed, a Book of Grace and Mercy. Thus this third section of the book could be entitled \\"Dreams and Fantasies\\". After examining the other dream vision poems and coordinating them towards a deepening understanding of midrashic analysis, we ford this courtly poem to be Chaucer's most kabbalistic enterprise. Long taken as his first major achievement, written as a young man in honour of his patron, John of Gaunt's grief for his beloved bride Blanche of Castile, The Book of the Duchess, I argue by internal and external evidence, is also one of Chaucer's last performative poems, in the sense that it was so popular over decades that it was re-performed and re-written for later memorial services to the Duke of Lancaster's wives and other great ladies of the court at their passing. It is thus a kind of palimpsest of the author's lengthy career as poet and trusted official of the court and state.<br /><br />The book may also be approached as a secret document expressing the man Chaucer's concealed and unconscious beliefs and attitudes towards Jewishness and Judaism, insofar as he came to understand them during his travels and readings of rabbinical and kabbalistic texts that came his way in France, Italy and Spain. Finally, in the ninth chapter, we try to draw together some of the threads we have spun and at the same time point to further directions for study.<br /><br />This present monograph could also be approached as another kind of secret book, in the sense that, as I went through the final stages of writing and editing, especially when inserting the various head and sub-heading texts, I realized that what was happening went beyond either historical or literary critical boundaries. The book was responding to the realities around me in the last years of the twentieth century and the earliest of the twenty-first, a time when dangers to the Jewish people became increasingly evident in words and actions not seen since the end of World War II. Even more, as I attempted to speak to friends and colleagues about the threats to Israel and the problems facing Jewish academics in the climate of fear and intimidation, many reacted in ways that at first seemed totally irrational and inexplicable-until it started to become clear that many of these erstwhile confidants and associates who drew back, turned away, or openly attacked Jews and Judaism in the contemporary world were behaving in terms that had been cautiously and hesitatingly opened up by this study of Chaucer (as well as the earlier book on Sir Gawain and the Green Chapel). For that reason, the large number of citations of apparently incongruous authors sets out the territory of literary, historical, social, and psychological themes this book actually comes to deal with. To a certain extent, therefore, I am asking my audience to study this book as they would an exegetical text in the midrashic mode. If that is too much to ask of a contemporary student of Chaucer, then I apologize.le to call this approach a particular kind of rabbinical aesthetic deriving from the kabbalistic notion of the breaking of the vessels, but at this stage in our discussion we can only survey the biography of the man and then, midrashically, find new contexts for him as an individual and as a type of New <br />Christian living in England and serving his royal masters on the Continent.

Long taken as his first major achievement, written as a young man in honour of his patron, John of Gaunt's grief for his beloved bride Blanche of Castile, The Book of the Duchess, I argue by internal and external evidence, is also one of Chaucer's last performative poems, in the sense that it was so popular over decades that it was re-performed and re-written for later memorial services to the Duke of Lancaster's wives and other great ladies of the court at their passing. It is thus a kind of palimpsest of the author's lengthy career as poet and trusted official of the court and state. <br />The book may also be approached as a secret document expressing the man Chaucer's concealed and unconscious beliefs and attitudes towards Jewishness and Judaism, insofar as he came to understand them during his travels and readings of rabbinical and kabbalistic texts that came his way in France, Italy and Spain. Finally, in the ninth chapter, we try to draw together some of the threads we have spun and at the same time point to further directions for study. <br />This present monograph could also be approached as another kind of secret book, in the sense that, as I went through the final stages of writing and editing, especially when inserting the various head and sub-heading texts, I realized that what was happening went beyond either historical or literary critical boundaries. The book was responding to the realities around me in the last years of the twentieth century and the earliest of the twenty-first, a time when dangers to the Jewish people became increasingly evident in words and actions not seen since the end of World War II. Even more, as I attempted to speak to friends and colleagues about the threats to Israel and the problems facing Jewish academics in the climate of fear and intimidation, many reacted in ways that at first seemed totally irrational and inexplicable-until it started to become clear that many of these erstwhile confidants and associates who drew back, turned away, or openly attacked Jews and Judaism in the contemporary world were behaving in terms that had been cautiously and hesitatingly opened up by this study of Chaucer (as well as the earlier book on Sir Gawain and the Green Chapel). For that reason, the large number of citations of apparently incongruous authors sets out the territory of literary, historical, social, and psychological themes this book actually comes to deal with. To a certain extent, therefore, I am asking my audience to study this book as they would an exegetical text in the midrashic mode. If that is too much to ask of a contemporary student of Chaucer, then I apologize. <br />	2004-12-29

The changes reflect the rapid and extensive additions to this field of veterinary medicine that have taken place over the last 10 years.<br /><br />The basic organization of the earlier editions is retained in this Manual. The first section of the Manual discusses the essential requirements for making a neurological diagnosis and includes: neurological examination; lesion localization and differential diagnosis; clinical pathology; electrophysiology; and neuroradiology. The neuroradiology chapter represents the greatest change, with more detail on the advanced imaging techniques, while retaining thorough descriptions of radiographic techniques. A new chapter on tissue biopsy is also included in this section.<br /><br />The second section of the Manual focuses on different presenting problems. A number of chapters, including coma, stupor and behavioural change, neck and back pain, and tail, anal and bladder dysfunction, have been added since the previous edition due to the overwhelming increase in information now available on both new and previously described diseases. Each chapter in this section presents the diseases in a similar way, detailing clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.<br /><br />The final section of the Manual contains completely new chapters devoted to therapeutics. The chapters include: emergency presentations (detailing spinal trauma, head injury and status epilepticus); anaesthesia, analgesia and supportive care; clinical pharmacology; radiotherapy; neurosurgery (indications and complications); and rehabilitation of the neurological patient.<br /><br />The chapters throughout the Manual are accompanied by stunning specially commissioned full-color illustrations.<br /><br />CONTENTS: The neurological examination; Lesion localization and differential diagnosis; Clinical pathology; Electrophysiology; Neuroradiology; Tissue biopsy; Seizures; Coma, stupor and behavioural change; Disorders of eyes and vision; Head tilt and nystagmus; Neurological abnormalities of the head and face; Tremor and involuntary movements; Neck and back pain; Tetraparesis; Paraparesis; Monoparesis; Exercise intolerance, collapse and paroxysmal disorders; Tail, anal and bladder dysfunction; Neurological emergencies; Anaesthesia, analgesia and supportive care; Principles of neurosurgery; Drug therapy for diseases of the central nervous system; Radiation therapy of the nervous system; Nursing and rehabilitation of the neurological patient; Appendices; Index.ential diagnosis; Clinical pathology; Electrophysiology; Neuroradiology; Tissue biopsy; Seizures; Coma, stupor and behavioural change; Disorders of eyes and vision; Head tilt and nystagmus; Neurological abnormalities of the head and face; Tremor and involuntary movements; Neck and back pain; Tetraparesis; Paraparesis; Monoparesis; Exercise intolerance, collapse and paroxysmal disorders; Tail, anal and bladder dysfunction; Neurological emergencies; Anaesthesia, analgesia and supportive care; Principles of neurosurgery; Drug therapy for diseases of the central nervous system; Radiation therapy of the nervous system; Nursing and rehabilitation of the neurological patient; Appendices; Index.	2004-12-27

Revisiting Philosophical and Theological Teaching in Tertiary Institutions in Africa\\". The Consultation took place in Kumasi, Ghana, and was part of an intercontinental research project on the reform of philosophical and theological curricula, initiated by the MWI.<br /><br />The introductory lectures were given by Peter Lwaminda, Marco Moerschbacher and Henry C. Hoeben, s.m.a.<br /><br />Peter Lwaminda, Secretary General of SECAM, looked upon the message of the African Synod (1994) and its impact on a possible change in Tertiary Institutions of Africa. The challenge continues to be that of relevance by finding the way to true Africanness. A thorough and courageous inculturation has to address the precarious situations in which the majority of the African people find themselves today. The programmes, methods and contents of philosophical and theological teaching and research are challenged to address the present situation of Africans.<br /><br />Marco Moerschbacher (MWI) confronted a reading of the magisterial texts Sapientia christiana (1979) and Ex corde ecclesiae (1990) and their understanding of Catholic Institutions of Higher Learning with some emerging methodological paradigms of contextual theology in Africa.<br /><br />Henry C. Hoeben presented a historical overview on Catholic Theological Faculties in Africa, starting from the first attempt in Roma (South Africa) in the 1940s up to the six existing Institutions of today (ICAO, Côte d'Ivoire; CIWA, Nigeria; UCAC, Yaound&eacute;; FCK, Kinshasa; CUEA, Kenya; ICM, Madagascar). He also recalled the history of the Association of Catholic Universities and Higher Institutes of Africa and Madagascar (ACUHIAM, also known under the French sigle of ASUNICAM). He pointed out three main challenges for these Institutions: 1) a renewed emphasis on research, publication and scholarly excellence; 2) the deepening of collaboration within the Catholic Church of Africa beyond boundaries of language, region and ethnicity; 3) the need to join efforts to support and improve the existing Institutions over against new foundations.<br /><br />The Conference followed a regional pattern. The participants from Southern Africa were Bishop Patrick Kalilombe, M.Afr. (University of Malawi), Madipoane Masenya (UNISA, South Africa) and Luke Mlilo (St. Joseph's Theo-<br /><br />logical Institute, South Africa). Kalilombe put some strategical questions on the project of contextualizing the philosophical and theological curricula. He emphasized the role of the African diocesan bishops and their dependence on Roman instances. - Masenya from the Protestant Open University UNISA mapped out the holistic and outcome-orientated approach in their BTh programme. Following a range of flexible modules, structured in four \\"tracks\\" (instead of the seven traditional theological disciplines), UNISA graduates are empowered to assume their responsibilities in both Church and society of their respective context. She suggested that, in continuation of this commitment to a contextual study of theology, burning issues like HIV/AIDS, poverty, unemployment and discrimina-tion against women should be explicitly addressed within the curriculum. - Mlilo gave an evaluation of four Tertiary Institutions in the Southern African region. Even though commitment to Africanization and contextualization is clearly spelled out on the conceptual level, its realization in practice often meets severe obstacles and problems. Stressing the need to overcome European concepts and contents and to strive towards an academic self-determination of the African Tertiary Institutions, M. highlighted some problems of the academic landscape in Africa, such as brain drain, the prevalence of non-African staff members, the individually focused European model of University education, the lack of an institutional co-operation within Africa, the marginalization of Africans due to globalization processes, and the shortage of African resource books. In each of these areas of concern, M. forwards concrete suggestions of \\"possible steps forward\\", based on two main convictions: The formation of teaching personnel has to become a top priority of the decision-making instances, and Africanness is to be given a key function in philosophy and theology in order to bridge the gap between these disciplines and African culture as lived out by the people.<br /><br />The contributors from Eastern Africa focused on the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (John Maviiri), Tangaza College (Carmel Powell, FMM) and Hekima College (Eugene Goussikindey, S.J.).<br /><br />Maviiri presented the various study cycles at CUEA. He called for a more holistic understanding of inculturation, including issues such as poverty, disease, marginalization of women, management of Church and state, peace and justice, forms of neocolonization and the effects of globalization to be addressed by the curricula. To strengthen the need of further Africanization he suggests an \\"African Studies Department\\" to be linked up with the existing disciplines. - Carmel Powell, FMM, gave an overview on the Institutes and Programmes of the Tangaza College. Stressing the areas of African contextualization and gender balance, she pleaded for training priests, religious and lay people in view of a \\"collaborative ministry\\" which is aware of the contribution of women to Church and society and which strives for a \\"discipleship of equals\\". - Goussikindey presented an analysis of the shifts in the curricula at Hekima College in the past twenty years. He held that the challenges brought about through the local situations call for a radical revision of the curricula. Especially the relationshipbetween philosophy and theology needs to be reconsidered. In view of today's interdisciplinary dialogues, the human and social sciences are to be given a prominent place in the theological study programmes.<br /><br />The Central African region was presented by Paulin Poucouta (Theology, Universit&eacute; Catholique de l'Afrique Central UCAC, Yaound&eacute;, Cameroon), Albertine Tshibilondi (Philosophy, also UCAC), L&eacute;onard Santedi (Theology, Facult&eacute;s Catholiques de Kinshasa FCK), and Jean-Chrysostome Akenda (Philosophy, also FCK).<br /><br />Poucouta presented a model curriculum in Theology, aiming at more Africanization. He stressed the key role of creative research and the institutional pre-condition for that research work, such as well equipped libraries and inter-institutional co-operation. - Tshibilondi undertook a critical relecture of the philosophical curriculum against the background of globalization and gender balance. She pleaded for an interdisciplinary outlook of philosophy and detected the concrete ambiguity of the role of the African teachers at Tertiary Institutions in Africa which are part and parcel of a whole system of cultural and economic dependency. The teachers have to critically review the theoretical framework of their own formation. - Santedi suggested three methodological steps to be followed by contextual theology: starting from the contextualization (with the Christian community as the key element), decontextualization (confronting this context with Bible and tradition and other sources of cultural and religious memory) and, finally, recontextualization (addressing the people and their expectations). - Akenda looked at the African situation with its various symptoms of crisis, the kind of graduate to be produced by Tertiary Institutions (pedagogical, moral and cultural values) and the tasks of philosophy as a critical and self-critical reflection on humankind. He spelled out this approach in view of requirements of the various courses taught in the philosophical curriculum.<br /><br />The West African region was represented by Josephat Oguejiofor (Bigard Memorial Seminary, Nigeria), Teresa Okure, SHCJ (Catholic Institute of West Africa), Marie-Madelaine N'Guessan, Xay. (Institut Sup&eacute;rieur de Sciences P&eacute;dagogiques et Religieuses, Abidjan) and Nathanaël Yaovi So&eacute;d&eacute; (Universit&eacute; Catholique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, Abidjan).<br /><br />Oguejiofor addressed the specific situation, ambivalence and impediments of philosophical teaching in Africa. The academic marginalization of Africa tends to be reinforced by the lack of co-operation among the various Institutions in Africa and by the impossibility to publish and circulate philosophical works at reasonable costs. His suggestions pointed to joint efforts towards systematic philosophical research (association, journal, conferences, series). - Okure presented the paradigm of inculturation as structural element of the theological teaching at CIWA. Its twofold aim is to create an interface between theological content and life, and to critically discern the cultural underpinnings of both theology and life. Her recommendations aimed at creating a network of philosophers and theologians in Africa in order to disseminate information, exchange lecturers and organise<br /><br />workshops on specific areas of concern. - N'Guessan paid special attention to the dialogue between education and theology. Especially the theological teaching should be done within a clearer framework of aims and methods. - So&eacute;d&eacute; re-viewed the self-understanding of the Faculties of Philosophy and of Theology at the UCAO-Abidjan. He suggested a methodological reappropriation of the Church's tradition, based on a theology that draws from African anthropology. Cultural boundaries have to be overcome by a mutual appreciation and exchange of African scholars, helped by academic associations and the improvement of the philosophical and theological libraries in the various Institutions.<br /><br />The Consultation issued some concrete recommendations on the necessary reform of study programmes in theology and philosophy. It also mandated a Committee to present the results and suggestions of the Consultation in form of curricula proposals. At the meeting of this Committee in Accra in June 2003 Luke Mlilo, Josephat Oguejiofor, Nathanaël So&eacute;d&eacute;, and Marco Moerschbacher were present to work on this task.ionshipbetween philosophy and theology needs to be reconsidered.

Once called bushmen, the San have survived various characterizations-from prehuman animals by the early European colonials to aboriginal conservationists in perfect harmony with nature by recent New Age adherents. Neither caricature does justice to the complex worldview of the San. Eminent anthropologists J. D. Lewis-Williams and D. G. Pearce present a balanced view of the spiritual life of this much-studied culture, examining the interplay of their cosmology, myths, rituals, and art. Integrating archaeological finds, historical accounts, ethnographic information, and interpretation of rock art, the authors discuss San cosmic geography, the role of shamans and mind-altering substances, the ritual of the trance dance, the legends recorded on stone, and other intriguing accounts of other-worldly experiences. From this, Lewis-Williams and Pearce detail the worldview of the San, how it plays out in their society, and how it has been challenged and altered by the modern world. For students of anthropology, archaeology, religion, and African studies, this volume is essential and fascinating reading.<br /><br />\\"Archaeology is the study of material culture.\\" \\"Archaeology is all about stones and bones.\\" These two statements, reiterated while being challenged by Lewis-Williams and Pearce, all too often characterize the results, if not the interests, of much of the research of Africanist archaeology. Too often, we are offered dry recitals of finds, neatly illustrated or described and imbedded in cleverly devised classifications, catalogs of artifacts rather than thoughtful portrayals of the people or events that brought them into being. My words, not theirs, but they are consonant with attitudes that brought forth this book. Over recent years, archaeology has attempted to discern the individual in the archaeological record or the gender of participants in the activities of the silent past. Lewis-Williams and Pearce plumb the psyche of those interviewed when some portion of the past was still retained in memory and use those data to inform the inquiry into the creation of southern African rock paintings.<br /><br />The urge to classify was understandable in the early years of the discipline, as archaeology strove to determine both its purpose and its methodology, but the past four decades following the introduction of \\"anthropological archaeology\\" have obligated us to indulge in a greater introspection with regard to the myriad leavings of the past and our methodologies for reading the archaeological palimpsest in general. Lewis-Williams and Pearce remind us how far we have come in the rediscovery of humankind's psychical ingenuity, and the perception of the worlds beyond its ken, through the investigation of archaeological remains-and how far we have yet to go. In the end, it does come down to artifacts and ingenious ways of comprehending them. Artifacts left us by the past take many forms transcending simple compilations of \\"stones and bones.\\"<br /><br />Delving into the workings of a nonliterate culture of distant antiquity is a dicey business. It is dependent on our comprehension of how such cultures articulated their everyday needs, and their comprehension of the world about them, in the material remains found in our excavations. Classifications were one answer, and the presumption of function-mundane or ritual-another. Neither approach was intellectually satisfying, so we looked toward analogous living people for an answer. The suggestion was for an archaeology founded in the theoretic of anthropology, utilizing the findings of ethnologists and their descriptions of how cultures functioned to inspire the interpretation of archaeological residues.<br /><br />We realize that the gap between past ways of life and their supposedly living representatives is a broad one. Yet, the closest we can approach long-dead cultures is the study of more recent folk engaged in the solution of similar kinds of ecological or social dilemmas. This approach is one suggesting models of behavior based on the eyewitness observations of such folk. Avoiding the pitfalls of simplistic \\"ethnographic analogy,\\" our authors realize that the most recent San, long in contact with alien cultures and changing social and economic conditions, have long ago ceased to be pristine representatives of \\"paleolithic man.\\" How, then, can we close with the painters and explore their world?<br /><br />Lewis-Williams and Pearce set forth on a fascinating excursion into the psychology and religious experience of extant dwellers in the perceptual universe of more modem representatives of the erstwhile for-aging people of South Africa. Only after having determined how this particular group of people expressed their perceptions can we proceed to think how we can use this information to determine some of the attitudes and visual presentations of the past.<br /><br />Using the ethnographic observations of an earlier generation of investigators, Lewis-Williams and Pearce attempt to reconstruct the world-view of an even earlier coterie of southern African hunter-gatherers. The neuropsychological approach they propose, resting on a solid body of anthropological evidence, provides a bridge for the extrapolation of some ethnography into the deep past.<br /><br />One of the most impressive and enduring of ancient humankind's leavings is art. Even if they are idle doodlings they are true representations of a world-invisible, as well as material-inhabited by the artists. In this case, we can present the art painted on rock faces scattered about southern Africa, or engraved onto stone, as vivid representations of a people's worldview. It, too, is often treated simply as anartifact to be inventoried, or as an artwork to be admired. Or abstracted into decorations divorced from their cultural context. Nevertheless, the rock art is more than the idle daubing of bored hunters waiting out the passage of game. Thus, an obvious conclusion asks us to determine what it is and how it functioned in the foreign country of the past. Recently, Augustine Holl offered a new perspective on interpreting some of the parietal rock art of the Sahara as instructive narratives associated with boys' initiation camps. The rock paintings of southern Africa appear to be equally instructive, though superficially less concerned with the mundane affairs of maintenance of the group's society or economy than with actions confirming a particular relationship with the super-natural and the role of the charismatic shaman in articulating that association.<br /><br />This ground-breaking volume detailing the how and why of the San spiritual experience and its expression in their art, and the re-creation of the ancient foragers' worldview, ought to be of interest to not only archaeologists researching this and other aspects of the archaeological palimpsest but also to anthropologists and historians of art searching to understand the neuropsychological wellsprings of human creativity as well as to students of charismatic religious experience.the solution of similar kinds of ecological or social dilemmas.

In other words, how can the idea of initiation in traditional Igbo culture and religion be used to make \\"Christus pro nobis\\" become Christus in nobis\\".<br /><br />If every work or study must have a method of approach, ours then will not and cannot be an exception. Which system of approach is adopted here for this study?<br /><br />The system of approach mainly adopted in this study is historicoanalytical. It is nonetheless also descriptive, expository and synthetical. The nature of this study and the aim it is set to achieve demand that the above approach be adopted for the purpose of coherence and clarity.<br /><br />The approach having been taken care of, what then is the scope of this study?<br /><br />\\"Culture\\", it is said, ,,provides society with inherited transmissible code of conduct as both part and junction of the total system of ideas, values, knowledge, philosophy, law, moral, and belief systems which constitute the content of life of a society.\\" Even centuries before the science of culture was born, the most effective missionaries were those blessed with a deep appreciation of the diversity of cultures and of the important role which cultures play in human behaviour. The most successful apostolic approaches have always been the ones geared most closely to the character and needs of the particular life-way. Effective mission has always gone hand in hand with immersion in local cultures. Hence the Church of Vatican II, however, became increasingly aware of its catholicity in the most authentic sense; the council fathers realised anew that the Christian faith is too rich to be portrayed adequately through a single cultural expression.<br /><br />God did not wait for missionaries to arrive to show Himself. Through the ages God has been revealing Himself in the customs, history and traditions of all peoples. He is present everywhere and missionaries help make explicit what is already implicit. What the missionaries introduced to Africans was not God but Christianity. The second Vatican Council brought out this theme very strongly. Some key texts of the Council serve as background for a return to an understanding of religious symbols of the people. For the Spanish-speaking apostolate in Latin America, that is the beginning of any effective catechesis today. Some of these key texts of the second Vatican Council are quoted extensively thus: It follows that among all the nations of the earth there is but one people of God which takes its citizens from every race .... The Church, or People of God, takes nothing away from the temporal welfare of any people by establishing that kingdom. Rather does she foster and take to herself, insofar as they are good, the ability, resources, and customs of each people. Taking them to herself she purifies, strengthens and ennobles them.\\" In another number it continues: The effect of her work is that whatever good is found sown in the minds and hearts of men or in the rites and customs of peoples, these not only are preserved from destruction, but are purified, raised up, and perfected for the glory of God, the confusion of the devil, and the happiness of men.\\" In these and in other numerous decrees, especially `Ad Gentes' (On the Mission of the Church), and the decree `Nostra Aetate' (On the Relationship of the Church to non-Christians), the Church sees clearly that the task is not to destroy but to ennoble and to perfect.<br /><br />The decree `Ad Gentes' understood mission not in the sense of the `the pagan countriesout there', but in the sense that all men are in the process of conversion and all have God's grace already working in them. Mission means going out of ourselves to give witness to the presence of the risen Lord. \\"That they (The Missionaries) may be able\\", the document advises; ,,to give this witness to Christ fruitfully, let them be joined to those men by esteem and love and acknowledge themselves to be members of the group of men among whom they live. Let them share<br /><br />in the cultural and social life by the various exchanges and enterprises of human living. Let them be familiar with their national and religious traditions and gladly and reverently laying bare the seeds of the word which lie hidden in them ....\\" Going further, it says: ,,From the customs and traditions of their people, from their wisdom and learning, from their arts and sciences these churches borrow all those things which contribute to the glory of their creator, the revelation of the Saviour's grace or the proper arrangement of Christian life .... Thus, it will be more clearly seen in what ways faith can seek for understanding in the philosophy and wisdom of these peoples .... Thanks to such a procedure every appearance of syncretism and false particularism can be excluded, and Christian life can be accommodated to the genius and the dispositions of each culture.\\"<br /><br />Other decree of Vatican II, which reflects on the cultural expression of religion is `Nostra Aetate'. If the Church can speak favorably about those who have not even begun the process of Christianity, how much more can she affirm those who are already in the process of Christianity. The Catholic Church rejects nothing which is true and holy in these religions. She, therefore, has this exhortation for her sons and daughters: Prudently and lovingly, through dialogue and collaboration with the followers of other religions, and in witness of Christian faith and life acknowledge, preserve and promote the spiritual and moral goods found among these men, as well as the values in their society and culture.\\"<br /><br />Adhering to the instructions and guidelines of the Church, as we have seen above, the scope of this study is limited to the Igboland and its people. This gives better chance for a thorough and in-dept study of the subject matter.

The essays collected in this volume - the first collection on the subject in either English or German - place discussions of nature and the human relationship with nature in their political contexts. Taken together, they trace the gradual shift from a confident belief in humanity's ability to tame and manipulate the natural realm to the Umweltbewujl'tsein driving the contemporary conservation movement. Nature in German History also documents efforts to reshape the natural realm in keeping with ideological beliefs - such as the Romantic exultation of `the wild' and the Nazis' attempts to eliminate `foreign' flora and fauna - as well as the ways in which political issues have repeatedly been transformed into discussions of the environment in Germany.	2004-12-08

He believes the platform's language should be forthright about deep ecology's debt to ecology, hence also its biological nondualism. At the same time, since there are many paths to deep ecology, if you accept some, but not all of the points, you are to that extent still a supporter of the deep ecology movement. Bender takes into account some of Naess's 1993 reflections and his own earlier arguments. The following are proposed nondogmatically, or, as Naess now suggests, as a set of abstract, general statements that most supporters of the deep ecology movement might accept.<br /><br />Proposed New Deep-Ecology Platform<br /><br />1. Everything on earth is both interdependent and transient.<br /><br />2. Each species' self-realization requires and contributes to that of all others.<br /><br />3. Nonhumans do not exist for humans' sake.<br /><br />4. Continued evolution without catastrophic setback requires the preservation of biodiversity, especially at the genetic and  ecosystemic levels.<br /><br />5. Other things being equal, human action is justifiable when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and complexity of the biotic community; it is wrong when it tends otherwise.<br /><br />6. Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive and rapidly worsening.<br /><br />7. Significant reduction of human impact requires first doing no further harm, then protecting and restoring biodiversity, wild-' ness, and evolution.<br /><br />8. Deep ecology supporters encourage the deep questioning if human happiness, progress, and technology as commonly .1 defined. The necessary changes include deliberately and humanely lowering the human population, redesigning the global economy, adopting low-impact technology, and changing personal lifestyles as required for ecological sustain- ability.<br /><br />9. Ecological sustainability also requires peace and justice throughout the world, and recognition that quality-of-life is about more than material standard of living. Especially in the poorest countries, social justice and long-term ecological sustainability are equally necessary, if people's material, self-preservation, rootedness, and spiritual-growth needs are to be met.<br /><br />10. Those who subscribe to these points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to carry out the necessary changes. Though the platform's applications vary considerably, in general deep ecology supporters work for local self-sufficiency and autonomous cooperation, and against centralization of power, exploitation of the weak, and corporate-controlled economic globalization.<br /><br />The platform, in short, poses a counteroffer to the culture of extinction, outlining numerous possibilities for engagement for those who take nondualism, ecology, ecocide, or overshoot seriously. Thus, deep ecology is potentially a solution, not only to ecocide, but to nihilism.bout more than material standard of living.

They have been exciting, fascinating, and delightful decades; I have enjoyed each one. During that half century, lens design has changed radically. In the mid-twentieth century, lens design was still a semi-intuitive art, practiced by a few dedicated individuals of great per-severance, knowledge, and skill. And by mid-century most of the classic lens design forms had already been created. To this day, these designs are still the basis of many excellent modern optical systems.<br /><br />Of course the practice of lens design today is radically different from what it was in the 1940s and 50s. Then, most optical design was done with an electromechanical desk calculator (e.g., Marchant, Frieden, and Monroe), and the raytracing rate, measured in terms of the number of surfaces through which one could trace the path of a ray in a given amount of time, was to the order of one ray surface in about 250s (if one were to work at it continuously through the day). Thus, using the cur-rent dimensions for raytracing speed, one did about 0.004 ray-surfaces per second. And these were only meridional two-dimensional rays, not the three-dimensional general rays ordinarily traced today. A great deal of ingenuity (and elegant theory) went into finding ways to avoid tracing any more rays than were absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Thanks to the modern personal computer or PC, the computing rate has increased almost unbelievably. Today a run-of-the-mill PC is capable of calculating several million ray-surfaces per second; this is about nine or ten orders of magnitude faster. Needless to say the techniques of lens design today differ mightily from those of fifty or sixty years ago. Then, the designer might calculate the derivatives of a few aberrations with respect to a limited number of constructional parameters and solve a small set of simultaneous, linear equations in the course of correcting his lens. These limited calculations were all carefully selected on the basis of theory, experience, and intuition. (Interestingly, one of the very real problems facing designers today is that the computer spews out<br /><br />numbers so rapidly that it takes strong self-discipline just to make one-self stop and think.)<br /><br />In modern lens design work, a computer program almost instantaneously calculates and solves equations which are far more than an order of magnitude more complex and extensive than those cited above. It is not atypical for the computer program to control about 50 lens performance characteristics by adjusting the values of some 20 or 30 construction parameters of the optical system. These latter numbers imply a design space with 20 or 30 dimensions, a complex space indeed.<br /><br />There are, however, some real limitations on the power of a so-called automatic lens design program. The typical program proceeds from a given starting design and drives the design to the nearest local optimum, a form at which any small structural changes will degrade the system performance. System performance is judged by a set of calculated characteristics defined in a merit function, which would be better termed a defect or error function, since the characteristics in it represent departures from desired values.<br /><br />Obviously then, the final automatic design solution is completely and uniquely determined by (a) the merit function, (b) the starting design form, and (c) the algorithm by which the computer solves the problem of locating an optimum design form with the minimum value of the merit function.<br /><br />When the first edition of Modern Lens Design (MLD) was published, there was a great need for a collection of suitable design forms at which to start the design process, and MLD provided almost 300 lens designs for this purpose. These designs were selected not only as starting points, but also as illustrations of important design principles. At the present time the need for sample designs, while still real, is significantly less, largely because most optical design programs now include libraries of lens designs. (These programs also include random search design capabilities which permit large changes in lens forms.) For example, all of the lens designs in the first edition of MLD (plus many others) are included in the lens libraries of the optical design program OSLO (a product of Lambda Research Corp.). Another program, LensVIEW by Brian Caldwell, is a compilation of over 30,000 lens designs and patents.<br /><br />That said, it is (at least it is for me) far more easy and convenient to scan and compare a series of printed design pages than it is to do the same thing on a computer screen (even with the multiwindow capabilities of many programs). For this and other reasons this second edition of MLD has retained about half of the original designs and has added some new ones. The reader may also find some additional designs in the works referenced at the end of the book.<br /><br />The practice of lens design is now essentially an engineering discipline. While this book is intended to be self-contained, we deliberately<br /><br />do not include a lot of derivations, or even the mechanics of exact ray tracing. And as valuable and cherished as they may be in academia, we happily omit any derivations from first principles, Maxwell's equations, or Fermat's principle. These are simply not necessary for a book on lens design. We make one exception to the no \\"ray tracing\\" rule, namely for the tracing of paraxial rays, which a lens designer often carries out by hand, or with a programmed pocket calculator. This topic is covered in the Formulary of Chapter 24, along with other valuable and frequently used geometrical optics relationships.<br /><br />However, there is currently a growing need for a more detailed exposition of basic lens design and theory in a single volume. The first edition of MLD was a \\"companion\\" volume to the author's Modern Optical Engineering. Several very basic lens design books have recently appeared; some are almost extended user manuals written for a specific design program. This edition of MLD is definitely not intended as a user manual, or as a guide to any specific program. It is an attempt to go well beyond this level by presenting both the basics of, and a more advanced approach to, lens design. The intent is to advise the reader how to get the most from any computer lens design program. To this end, about half of the lens designs in the first edition of MLD have been eliminated to make room for quite a bit of new material.<br /><br />The text is, as far as possible, completely program neutral. I have tried to make the material regarding design programs as generic as I could, discussing features that are available in almost all commercial soft-ware. I have used OSLO for the design work demonstrated in the text, and for preparing the new figures. (The lens analysis figures in the first edition of MLD were prepared with a customized version of the program GENII, using a new and unique presentation style which is now widely available; for an example, see the OSLO aberration plots herein.)<br /><br />Most neophyte lens designers very quickly get past the basics and learn to use their computer programs with a high level of proficiency. At this point, what they need most is an answer to the question, \\"What do I do now?\\" Much of the new material in this edition is designed to this end and takes the form of actual design projects carried out from scratch, warts and all. (In other words, I have not papered over the blunders I made in the design process.) These designs include a cemented doublet, a triplet anastigmat, a Tessar, a Heliar, a Dogmar, a telephoto, a Schmidt cassegrain, a binocular eyepiece, an apochromatic triplet, and a landscape lens. Many of these design stories are carried out to some length to illustrate all of the possible steps that can be taken toimprove a design. Every initial assumption is explained and justified. These design descriptions not only show the basic design<br /><br />approach, but continue on with advanced steps and the rationale for them.<br /><br />I have surveyed the literature at some length for any design techniques which might have a general applicability (as well as the reported specific use for the writer's specific problem). Some were found in the references listed at the end of the book. For the most part, the design techniques described here are those which I have found to be useful in working with an optimization program. Many of the techniques have been developed or refined during more than two decades of teaching courses in lens design; indeed some of these ideas were suggested or inspired by my students. Other valuable sources were the many informal discussions that I have been fortunate to have with my colleagues.<br /><br />For better or worse, one can never seem to squeeze all the material that you want into a book. At the manuscript deadline date there is always at least one more feature that you wished there was enough time to develop, write, and include. But I suppose that if there were time, no book would ever be finished.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there are only a modest number of well-understood and widely utilized principles of optical design. If one can master a thorough understanding of these principles, their effects, and their mechanisms, it is easy to recognize them in existing designs and also easy to apply them to one's own design work. It is the intent here to promote such understanding by presenting both expositions and annotated design examples of these principles.<br /><br />Readers are free to use the designs in this book as starting points for their own design efforts, or in any other way they see fit. The reader must accept full responsibility for meeting whatever limitations are imposed on the use of these designs by any patent, copyright, or other (whether indicated herein or not).c lens design books have recently appeared; some are almost extended user manuals written for a specific design program.

Brown (Standard Handbook of Machine Design: McGraw-Hill Professional) The definitive machine design handbook for mechanical engineers, product designers, project engineers, design engineers, and manufacturing engineers covers every aspect of machine construction and operation. The 3rd edition of the Standard Handbook of Machine Design will be redesigned to meet the challenges of a new mechanical engineering age. In addition to adding chapters on structural plastics and adhesives, which are replacing the old nuts bolts and fasteners in design, the author will also update and streamline the remaining chapters.<br /><br />Excerpt: This Third Edition of the Standard Handbook of Machine Design has been completely reorganized as compared to its two previous editions. To bring into focus the needs of the machine design engineer, without the distractions of ancillary material, the number of chapters has been reduced from 50 in the Second Edition to 39. These 39 chapters have been carefully grouped into nine distinct sections, denoted as Parts 1 through 9. These chapter groupings were inspired primarily by a set of eight \\"Machine Design Workbooks,\\" containing much of the material in the First Edition, and published between the First and Second Editions.<br /><br />After a new introductory chapter, \\"Evolution of a Successful Design,\\" the first of nine sections, Part 1, \\"Machine Elements in Motion,\\" presents four chapters on the seemingly endless ways to achieve a desired motion. Kinematics, or the geometry of motion, is probably the most important step in the design process, as it sets the stage for many of the other decisions that will be made as a successful design evolves. Whether it's a self-locking latch you are looking for, a complex cam shape, or an entire gear assembly, the information you need is here in these chapters.<br /><br />Part 2, \\"Machine Elements that Absorb and Store Energy,\\" contains three chapters presenting the classic machine elements: springs, flywheels, clutches, and brakes. Not all designs will have a need for these energy-related devices, but, when appropriate, no other device will do the job.<br /><br />Part 3, \\"Gearing,\\" contains five chapters covering every possible gear type, from basic spur gears to complex hypoid bevel gears sets; the intricacies of worm gearing; and the very versatile and relatively modern power screw designs.<br /><br />Part 4, \\"Power Transmission,\\" contains four chapters directed at the requirements of transferring motion from one rotating axis to another, whether by time-honored belt or chain configurations, or the wide variety of couplings used to isolate and protect downstream machine elements. This is also where the design of shafts, from both a static and dynamic viewpoint, is included.<br /><br />Part 5, \\"Bearings and Lubrication,\\" pulls together in one place the design of many types of roller bearings as well as the design aspects of the classic journal bearing. Bearings could not do their job without lubrication, and lubrication would be lost from most bearings without the proper seals. Traditional and nontraditional designs are presented.<br /><br />Part 6, \\"Fastening, Joining, and Connecting,\\" covers every conceivable type of mechanical fastener. When disassembly is not required, or when maximum strength is needed, then the only solution is a welded connection. All aspects of a welded connection are presented. Many connections must prevent leakage or provide cushioning, so a discussion of seals and their effect on a bolted connection is provided. The mating of parts without prior preassembly can be an important design requirement; therefore, this is where a detailed discussion of fits and tolerances is included.<br /><br />Part 7, \\"Load Capability Considerations,\\" provides the designer with the rules for determining if a particular part will fail. This determination does not have to be a precise calculation, either under static or dynamic conditions, whether the part is acting as a beam or column, but to ignore these fundamental principles is to invite<br /><br />disaster. This section seemed like the best place to discuss vibration and, just as important, its control.<br /><br />Part 8, \\"Performance of Engineering Materials,\\" brings to bear the science of material behavior, to include the changes that take place during the manufacturing process. Once in service, machine elements are subject to constant wear and the adverse effects of corrosion.<br /><br />Lastly, Part 9, \\"Classical Stress and Deformation Analysis,\\" provides the design engineer with the fundamental formulas for stress, deflection, and deformation, and includes special geometries such as curved elements and special loadings, which are found in cylinders under internal pressure when parts are press fitted.<br /><br />One of the chapters included in the First and Second Editions, \\"Sections and Shapes-Tabular Data,\\" has been provided in this Third Edition as an appendix.her under static or dynamic conditions, whether the part is acting as a beam or column, but to ignore these fundamental principles is to invite <br />disaster.

This is the first publication to cover this field in a cohesive and comprehensive way. The focus of this book is on existing technologies used by the industry, as well as newly emerging technologies and trends, evolution of which has been driven by the actual needs and by the industry-led consortia and organizations.<br /><br />Over the last decade, IT has had a profound impact on the evolution of industrial enterprises toward fully integrated entities. Nowadays, we witness major efforts led by some of the largest multinationals to harness IT to achieve integration of I/O control, device configuration, and data collection across multiple networks and plant units; seamless integration between automation and business logistic levels to exchange jobs and production data; transparent data interfaces for all stages of the plant life cycle; the Internet- and Web-enabled remote diagnostics and maintenance, as well as electronic orders and trans-actions. Some of the IT technologies used in the office and enterprise operation have been adopted and/or transformed to suit and advance industrial controls and automation, and industrial enterprise integration. OPC, Real-Time Corba, Real-Time Linux, Windows CE, real-time specifications for Java (RTSJ, RTCE), and Real-Time UML are good examples, to mention some. The Internet technologies extended the boundaries of the operation of industrial enterprises to their customers and suppliers, as well as the management and technical staff through electronic commerce, B2B, remote data access, and monitoring and control. The industrial IT field spans a number of technological areas such as software and hardware technologies, as well as Web and networking technologies. Those technologies, when used in an integrative way, offera potential for horizontal and vertical integration of functional layers of industrial units and enterprises, thus transforming traditional islands of automation and enterprise operations into more integrated enterprises better adjusted to cope with the demands of competitive markets.<br /><br />The book contains 112 contributions on topics related to industrial IT, written by experts from industry and academia. One third of the contributions are from industry and industrial research establishments; from the leading multinational corporations at the forefront of the development of IT and industrial automation technologies, to mention ABB (Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland), Alcatel (Belgium), Cadence Systems, Microsoft Corporation, NEC Labs (U.S.), Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric (France and Germany), Siemens (Austria and Germany), Volvo Truck Corp. (Sweden), and Yokogawa America. Most of the multinationals mentioned play a leading role in the formulation of long-term policies for technology development, and are key members of the industry-academe consortia implementing those policies.<br /><br />The contributions from academia and governmental research organizations are represented by some of the most renowned and reputable institutions such as Columbia University, Cornell University, Frauenhofer FOKUS (Germany), Georgia Institute of Technology, Monash University (Australia), National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S.), Princeton University, Politecnico di Torino (Italy), UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, University of Texas at Austin and Dallas, University of Tokyo, Stanford University, Technical University of Berlin, Vienna University of Technology, and many others.<br /><br />The material is presented in the form of tutorials, surveys, and technology overviews combining fundamentals with advanced issues, making this publication relevant to the beginner as well as seasoned professional from industry and academia. Particular emphasis is on the industrial perspective, illustrated by actual implementations and technology deployments. The contributions are grouped into sections for cohesive and comprehensive presentation of the areas treated. Some of these sections can be used as a reference material for study (including a formal coursework) at the intermediate through advanced levels. The reports on recent technology developments, deployments, and trends frequently cover material released to the profession for the first time.<br /><br />The handbook is designed to cover a very wide range of topics that comprise the field of industrial IT. The material covered in this volume will be of interest to a wide spectrum of professionals and researchers from industry and academia, as well as graduate students, from the fields of industrial and mechatronic engineering, production engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and IT.<br /><br />The book is organized into two parts. Part 1, Fundamentals of Information Technology, presents material to cover new and fast evolving aspects of IT. Part 2, Industrial Information Technology, introduces cutting-edge and newly emerging areas of industrial IT.<br /><br />The focus of the book is on fast evolving areas with a major impact on the evolution of industrial automation and industrial enterprise integration. Some of those areas have received limited coverage in other publications due to the fast evolution of the technologies involved, or material confidentiality, or limited circulation in the case of industry-driven developments. The areas covered in the book include industrial communication technology, sensor technology, embedded systems, the Internet, Web and IT technologies in industrial automation, and industrial enterprise integration. To complement this mate-rial, it was felt appropriate to include background reading material on some of the fastest evolving areas of IT and IP networking. This has been done primarily to assist readerswith little or no background in IT and networking technologies, both essential to understand most of the chapters in Part 2 of the book.<br /><br />Part 1 has two sections: Computer Software and Web Technologies and The Internet and IP Networks. The section on Computer Software and Web Technologies introduces some of the recent software technologies, platforms, and solutions that have had a profound impact on industrial control and automation, and industrial enterprise integration. It covers material in subsections: Development Platforms and Frameworks, The Unified Modeling Language, Middleware, Web Technologies, Web Programming, and Multidimensional Databases. Specifically, this section introduces J2EE platform and .Net framework in the Development Platforms and Frameworks subsection. J2EE is used extensively at the enterprise business level. The .Net is studied and experimented with by the industry for applications ranging from control to enterprise integration. An overview of UML and its extensions, variants, and implementations is provided in the subsection The Unified Modeling Language. The UML language has become a de facto standard for modeling real-time and embedded systems, industrial control and automation, as well as business systems. The contribution on UML also introduces selected applications of the language in control and automation. The Middleware subsection, on network connectivity software, gives a roundup of Microsoft's distributed components technologies, and Object Management Group Corba standard for object-oriented distributed computing, both of central importance to industrial control and automation. The Web servers, clients, and browsers, as well as languages used for Web and the Internet programming are introduced in the Web Technologies subsection. The client-server model is dominant in legacy automation systems. Web services, which allow for platform and language independence in the client-server model, are discussed in the Web Programming subsection. The Multidimensional Databases subsection gives an overview of multidimensional databases, which is the key technology for the analysis of data, and is essential for effective operation of automated industrial enterprises.<br /><br />The section The Internet and IP Networks provides a comprehensive overview of the Internet and IP network technologies. These technologies have had a major impact on the vertical integration of functional levels of industrial enterprises and the operation of the business level through a variety of e-technologies. This section provides a handy reference material useful for the study of the remaining sections.<br /><br />The topics covered are organized in the following subsections: Introduction to the Internet, Internet Core Protocols, Quality of Service in IP Networks, Internet Applications and Application Services, Management of IP Networks, Network Security, and Ad Hoc Networking. Over the last decade, the Internet and IP network technologies have become the basis and catalyst for the transformation of industrial enterprises from so-called \\"islands of automation\\" into relatively well-integrated, both horizontally and vertically, modern industrial entities. The section offers a comprehensive overview of the Internet technologies. The contributions introduce fundamentals, as well as present new developments, making the material attractive to both novices and advanced users of those technologies.<br /><br />A general overview of the Internet is given in the Introduction to the Internet subsection. Core protocols and IP routing are covered in the Internet Core Protocols subsection. This subsection also includes contributions on multicast, congestion control and Quality of Service (QoS), mobile IP routing, and IP-mobility for cellular and wireless systems. The subsection QoS in IP Networks gives an overview of QoS in IP networks and introduces the main features of Multiprotocol Label Switching architecture that integrates label swap-ping forwarding with network layer routing. It also presents material on the Internet Integrated Services (IntServ) architecture and Reservation Protocol (RSVP), and Internet protocols for real-time Applications (RTP, RTCP, RTSP). Mail transfer protocols (SMTP, POP, IMAP), file transfer protocol (FTP), and hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) are covered in the Internet Applications and Applications Services subsection. Selected aspects of IP networks management are presented in the Management of IP Networks subsection. This includes Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Network security and firewalls are introduced in the Network Security subsection. The contribution on Ad hoc networking concludes the section on The Internet and IP Networking.<br /><br />Part 2 of the book begins with a section on Industrial Communication Systems. Industrial data networks play a pivotal role in the automation and integration of the factory floor by collecting process data and distributing control decisions. This is a very fast evolving area of technology with Ethernet becoming a de facto industry standard for communication in factories and plants at the fieldbus level. The random and native CSMA/CD arbitration mechanism is being replaced by other solutions allowing for deterministic behavior required in real-time communication to support soft and hard real-time dead-lines. The wireless and mobile communication technologies have already been recognized as a viable alternative for data communication on the factory floor, with the number of reported actual deployments on the rise. This necessitates the development of new solutions for the integration of wireline and wire-less fieldbuses. The requirement for the process data availability via remote access prompted research and creation of new solutions for linking factory floor with the Internet.<br /><br />The material in this section is organized in the following subsections: Introduction to Data Communication Networks, Field Area Networks, Ethernet and Wireless/Mobile Network Technologies, Linking Factory Floor with the Internet and Wireless Fieldbusses, Security and Safety Technologies in Industrial Networks, and Automotive and Industrial Applications. The first section begins with an introduction to data communication networks to cover principles of lower-layer protocols for data communication to be followed by material on wireless local area networks (WLAN) and wireless personal area networks (WPAN) is presented. The next subsection, Field Area Networks, contains a comprehensive technical overview of some of the most widely used fieldbuses in the industry. The contributions describe and evaluate Profibus, WorldFIP, Fundation Fieldbus, CAN, EIA-709, time-triggered communication net-works, and IEEE 1394. The choice of networks and selected issues related to networked control systems are also covered. Ethernet is fast becoming a de facto industry standard for communication in factories and plants at the fieldbus level. The random and native CSMA/CD arbitration mechanism is being replaced by other solutions allowing for deterministic behavior required in real-time communication to support soft and hard real-time deadlines. These issues and various solutions, including those proposed and already adopted by the industry, are discussed in the Ethernet and Wireless/Mobile Network Technologies subsection. The subsection also provides a comprehensive overview of the issues involved in using wireless communication on the factory floor, ranging from the reliability and timeliness of lower-layer wireless protocols to suggestions for new MAC protocols. Bluetooth is also covered. The need for remote access to factory floor data calls for connecting factory floor with the Internet. The solutions are discussed in the Linking Factory Floor with the Internet and Wireless Fieldbuses subsection. The subsection also presents architectures and solutions for linking wireline and wireless fieldbuses, a new trend resulting from the presence on the factory floor of devices using wireless communications such as wireless sensors, for instance. The security and safety issues in industrial communication networks are presented in the Security and Safety Technologies in Industrial Networks subsection. An implementation of safety technologies is presented in a case study describing Profisafe technology used with Profibus. The Automotive and Industrial Applications subsection presents a case study introducing and evaluating the use of different networks in automotive applications, specifically in the range of Volvo commercial automotive products. This subsection also introduces and illustrates the use of the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) protocol, an OSI application layer messaging protocol designed for the remote control and monitoring of devices such as Remote Terminal Units (RTU), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Numerical Controllers (NC), or Robot Controllers (RC).<br /><br />The use of the Internet, Web, and IT technologies in industrial control, automation, and design is presented in the section The Internet, Web, and IT Technologies in Industrial Automation and Design. This is a vast area and reporting has had to be limited to selected topics where the impact of these technologies was most notably felt. This section also includes a contribution on IT security in automation systems.<br /><br />The contributions are organized into the following subsections: Internet and Web-Based Technologies in Industrial Automation, Component Technologies in Industrial Automation, Java Technology in Industrial Automation, Standards for Programmable Logic Controllers and System Design, Virtual Reality in Design<br /><br />and Manufacturing, and Security for Automation Systems. The issues, solutions, and technologies involved in remote monitoring and control, as well as maintenance, an aim for industrial enterprises and urban automation, are presented in the Internet and Web-Based Technologies in Industrial Automation subsection. This subsection also covers material on telemanipulation over the Internet, and material on the use of IT technologies. OLE for Process Control (OPC), the standard interface for access to Microsoft's Windows-based applications in automation, is one of the most popular industrial standards among users and developers of Human Machine Interface (HMI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Distributed Control System (DCS) for PC-based automation, as well as Soft PLCs. OPC is discussed in detail in the subsection on Component Technologies in Industrial Automation. (A comprehensive evaluation of Corba technology, and implementations can be found in a contribution on OCEAN in the section on Integration Technologies.) An overview of Java technology, real-time extensions, and prospects for applications in controls and industrial automation are given in the lava Technology in Industrial Automation subsection. This contribution provides a roundup of two different real-time extensions for the Java language: Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) developed by the Real-Time for Java Expert Group under the auspices of Sun Microsystems and reference implemented by TimeSys Corp, and Real-Time Core Extensions developed by Real-Time Java Working Group operating within J-Consortium. The contribution also introduces Real-Time Data Access (RTDA) specification developed by the Real-Time Data Access Working Group (RTAWG), also operating within J-Consortium. The RTDA specification focuses on API for accessing I/O-data in typical industrial and embedded applications. The subsection on Standards for Programmable Logic Controllers and System Design introduces three standards: IEC 60848 Ed. 2, IEC 61131-3, and IEC 61499. The IEC 61499 standard defines a reference architecture for open and distributed control systems, which provides the means for compatibility between automation systems of different vendors. Virtual reality has become an important tool for the design and prototyping of products and complex systems. The subsection Virtual Reality in Design and Manufacturing contains two contributions introducing selected aspects of haptic simulation in design and manufacturing, and the use of virtual reality techniques in the design and validation of factory communication systems. The topic of IT security in automation systems is thoroughly explored at the end of the section. The IT security in automation systems poses a particular challenge given the requirement for remote control and manufacturing.<br /><br />The current trend in the industry for flexible and distributed control and automation has accelerated the migration of the intelligence and control functions to the field devices, particularly sensors and actuators. The increased processing capabilities of those devices were instrumental in the emergence of a trend for networking of field devices around industrial data networks. The benefits are numerous, including increased flexibility, improved system performance, and ease of system installation, upgrade, and maintenance. The increased functional complexity of those devices, however, has pushed their development into the realm of formal design methods and tools characteristic of embedded systems. Another trend in networking of field devices has emerged recently: the wireless sensor networks. A number of deployments on the factory floor have been reported. In this context, the integration of wireline and wire-less technologies becomes an important issue. Recent advances in the research on \\"intelligent space,\\" which initially targeted an office environment, have helped enhance navigation capabilities of industrial autonomous and mobile robots, which are an integral element of automated factories. Some of those issues and trends are presented in the Intelligent Sensors and Sensor Networks section.<br /><br />The material is structured into the following subsections: Intelligent Sensor and Device Technology, Intelligent Sensors in Robotics, Sensor Systems and Networks, and Multisensor Data Fusion. The Intelligent Sensor and Device Technology subsection provides an in-depth overview of the technologies and standards behind intelligent sensors and actuators. It begins with material on the IEEE 1451 standards for<br /><br />connecting sensors and actuators to microprocessors, control and field networks, and instrumentation systems. The standards also defined the Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS), which allows for the self-identification of sensors. The IEEE 1451 standards facilitate sensor networking, a new trend in industrial automation, which, among other benefits, offers strong economic incentives. The networking issues and supporting integration technologies are discussed in the next contribution, which also out-lines evolution of the intelligent device (sensors and actuators) networking concepts. Intelligent sensors, in addition to performing measurements and sensory information processing, embed complex functionalities essential for their operation and communications. The use of semi/formal design techniques and supporting tools, essential for a rapid and cost-effective design, is discussed in the subsection along with the introduction to the CAP modeling language, which allows for rapid prototyping of intelligent devices. The robotic technology has become an integral part of industrial automation. An overview of the fundamental sensor technologies in robotics is presented in the Intelligent Sensors in Robotics sub-section. The material covers vision, tactile sensing, sense of smell, and ultrasonic sensors. The subsection Sensor Systems and Networks presents contributions on intelligent space and sensor networks, and development methodologies. The intelligent space concept provides solutions, among others, for location of mobile robots nowadays frequently operating autonomously on the factory floor. Distributed wireless sensor networks is a relatively new and exciting proposition for collecting sensory data in the industrial environment. The design of this kind of network poses a particular challenge due to limited computational power and memory size, bandwidth restrictions, power consumption restriction if battery powered, communication requirements, and unattended mode of operation in case of industrially hostile environments, to mention some. The subsection provides a comprehensive discussion of the design issues related to, in particular, self-organizing networks, to include Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocols, routing protocols, security, location determination, and power management. It also discusses existing software solutions and systems supporting the development of the dynamic wire-less sensor networks. This presentation includes middleware, operating systems and execution environments, languages, and whole software frameworks. The section concludes with a subsection and material on Multisensor Data Fusion.<br /><br />The advances in the embedded systems particularly in design methodology and supporting tools, allowed for cost-effective migration of the intelligence and control functions into field devices. This, coupled with developments in other areas, promoted a shift toward decentralized architectures of industrial automation systems, and whole enterprises. The embedded systems is one of the fastest growing areas of technology, and crucial for the realization of fully automated plants and factories. The Real-Time Embedded Systems section gives a comprehensive overview of the field: basics and emerging trends. It covers design aspects, languages and tools, security, real-time and embedded operating systems, and net-worked embedded systems.<br /><br />The contributions are organized in the following subsections: Embedded Systems, Security in Embedded Systems, System-on-Chip and Network-on-Chip Design, and Networked Embedded Systems. The fundamental and advanced aspects of embedded systems and design are presented in the subsection Embedded Systems. This subsection contains material introducing comprehensively real-time systems, design of embedded systems, models of computation, languages for embedded systems to include hardware-level design and verification languages, design of software for embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and power-aware embedded computing. The security in embedded systems is presented in the Security in Embedded Systems subsection. The material in this subsection gives a roundup of the security issues and solutions adopted by the industry. The System-on-Chip and Network-on-Chip Design subsection provides a comprehensive overview of the issues involved in the design of systems and networks on chip. The material in this subsection covers system-on-chip and network-on-chip design, platform-based and<br /><br />derivative design, hardware/software interfaces design for systems-on-chip, and on-chip networks. Networked embedded systems are introduced in the Networked Embedded Systems subsection.<br /><br />The last decade has witnessed an accelerated evolution of industrial enterprises. This trend has been driven by financial factors, and availability of practically proven and affordable technologies and solutions. The advances in the embedded systems design and falling fabrication cost allowed for deployment on the factory floor of a new generation of smart and relatively inexpensive field devices with increased functionality. The trend for networking smart field devices using industrial data networks has trans-formed control architecture from centralized into distributed and decentralized. This, in turn, allowed for efficient integration of I/O control, device configuration, and data collection across multiple networks and plant units. In this context, the control network, to date largely used to integrate devices at the field-bus level, attained a newintegrative role. Other equally profound changes of an integrative nature include seamless integration between automation and business logistic levels to exchange jobs and production data; transparent data interfaces for all stages of the plant life cycle; the Internet- and Web-enabled remote diagnostics and maintenance, as well as electronic orders and transactions. This integration has been achieved through an interplay of different technologies and solutions. The IT technologies have played some of the most important roles in this process. This section shows a small cross-section of the integration efforts and results, primarily arising from activities of major control and automation vendors and multinational groupings. These efforts have a potential for lasting solutions and new technologies.<br /><br />The material is organized in the following subsections: E-Technologies in Enterprise Integration, IT Technologies in Enterprise Integration, Network-Based Integration Technologies, Agent-Based Technologies in Industrial Automation, and Industrial Information Technology Solutions for Energy and Power Systems. An introduction to e-manufacturing is presented in the E-Technologies in Enterprise Integration subsection. This material gives an overview of the e-manufacturing strategies, fundamental elements, and requirements to meet the changing needs of the manufacturing industry in transition to an e-business environment. It covers e-manufacturing, e-maintenance, e-factory, and e-business. The subsection IT Technologies in Enterprise Integration contains four contributions discussing the use of XML and Web Services, and other IT technologies in enterprise integration. The first contribution deals with replacing paper flow by electronic technologies, and presents the use of XML as a means for information exchange during the design and development of automation systems. The next contribution introduces the World Batch Forum's (WBF) Business To Manufacturing Markup Language (B2MML), which is a set of XML schemas that are based upon the ISA-95 Enterprise-Control System Integration Standards. The material demonstrates how B2MML can be used to exchange data between the business/enterprise and manufacturing systems. The contribution also gives a roundup of the ISA-95 standard. The Web Services technology provides the means for the implementation of open and platform-independent integrated automation systems. The challenges for using Web Services in automated systems, solutions, and future trends are discussed in the third contribution. The final contribution in this subsection presents IT-based connectivity solutions for interfacing production and business systems. The presented concepts and architectures are a result of an extensive study and prototyping efforts conducted by ABB in the search for cost-effective approaches leveraging existing mainstream technologies such as enterprise application integration (EAI), Web services and XML, as well as emerging industry standards such as ISA 95 and CIM. The subsection Network-Based Integration Technologies presents novel industry approaches to the development of distributed and flexible automation systems centered around control networks. Prominent examples of these approaches discussed in this subsection are the PROFInet standard of the PROFIBUS User Organization, and the Interface for Distributed Automation (IDA) standard of the IDA Group e.V. Both the approaches draw extensively from the use of Ethernet TCP/IP, Web, and network security technologies, and allow for horizontal and vertical integration, and interoperability of devices from different vendors to mention some features. Another notable development presented in this sub-section is the Open Controller Enabled by an Advanced real-time Network (OCEAN) project with the aim of realizing a real-time-capable platform for distributed control applications for numerical controls based on standardized communication systems and delivered asan open source. The development draws heavily from the results of the Open System Architecture for Controls within Automation (OSACA) Systems project, a precursor of OCEAN. The high degree of complexity of manufacturing systems coupled with the market-dictated requirements for agility lead to a development of new manufacturing architectures and solutions based on distributed, autonomous, and cooperating units, integrated by the plug-and-play approach, called agents. The Agent-Based Technologies in Industrial Automation subsection offers a comprehensive treatment of the topic. It begins with an introduction to the concept of agents and technology, cooperation and coordination models, interoperability, and applications to manufacturing systems. Agents dedicated to real-time manufacturing tasks are called holons. The use of holons and related concepts in manufacturing systems is discussed in the next contribution.section also covers material on telemanipulation over the Internet, and material on the use of IT technologies. OLE for Process Control (OPC), the standard interface for access to Microsoft's Windows-based applications in automation, is one of the most popular industrial standards among users and developers of Human Machine Interface (HMI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Distributed Control System (DCS) for PC-based automation, as well as Soft PLCs.

The material demonstrates how B2MMLcan be used to exchange data between the business/enterprise and manufacturing systems. The contribution also gives a roundup of the ISA-95 standard. The Web Services technology provides the means for the implementation of open and platform-independent integrated automation systems. The challenges for using Web Services in automated systems, solutions, and future trends are discussed in the third contribution. The final contribution in this subsection presents IT-based connectivity solutions for interfacing production and business systems. The presented concepts and architectures are a result of an extensive study and prototyping efforts conducted by ABB in the search for cost-effective approaches leveraging existing mainstream technologies such as enterprise application integration (EAI), Web services and XML, as well as emerging industry standards such as ISA 95 and CIM. The subsection Network-Based Integration Technologies presents novel industry approaches to the development of distributed and flexible automation systems centered around control networks. Prominent examples of these approaches discussed in this subsection are the PROFInet standard of the PROFIBUS User Organization, and the Interface for Distributed Automation (IDA) standard of the IDA Group e.V. Both the approaches draw extensively from the use of Ethernet TCP/IP, Web, and network security technologies, and allow for horizontal and vertical integration, and interoperability of devices from different vendors to mention some features. Another notable development presented in this sub-section is the Open Controller Enabled by an Advanced real-time Network (OCEAN) project with the aim of realizing a real-time-capable platform for distributed control applications for numerical controls based on standardized communication systems and delivered as an open source. The development draws heavily from the results of the Open System Architecture for Controls within Automation (OSACA) Systems project, a precursor of OCEAN. The high degree of complexity of manufacturing systems coupled with the market-dictated requirements for agility lead to a development of new manufacturing architectures and solutions based on distributed, autonomous, and cooperating units, integrated by the plug-and-play approach, called agents. The Agent-Based Technologies in Industrial Automation subsection offers a comprehensive treatment of the topic. It begins with an introduction to the concept of agents and technology, cooperation and coordination models, interoperability, and applications to manufacturing systems. Agents dedicated to real-time manufacturing tasks are called holons. The use of holons and related concepts in manufacturing systems is discussed in the next contribution.	2004-12-07

The struggle may be a moral one, or it maybe a physical one, or it maybe both. But it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will. -Frederick Douglass<br /><br />African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom is designed to help students in the survey course gain an understanding of that struggle. It introduces the concepts, milestones, and significant figures of African American history. Inasmuch as that history is grounded in struggle-in the consistent and insistent call to the United States to make good on constitutional promises made to all its citizens-this book is also an American history text. Hence, the milestones of mainstream American history, economy, politics, arts and letters are interwoven in its pages.<br /><br />But African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom seeks to do something more. It engages the reader in viewing history through the lens of many biographies and through the perspectives of people who lived those struggles to ensure, in the words of Langston Hughes' famous poem, that \\"America Will Be.\\" This unique biographical approach to African American history positions African American lives at the center of the narrative and as the basis of analysis.<br /><br />BIOGRAPHICAL APPROACH<br /><br />African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom tells the stories of the lives of both the illustrious (abolitionist Martin Delany) and the ordinary (planter Isaiah Montgomery), the public and the private perspectives of those who shaped the African American story. Some individuals are famous for their specific contributions; other individuals are representative of a larger idea, a concept of a people who have inhabited the American continent for more than half a millennium.<br /><br />Throughout the book we examine the struggles of African Americans to define their own identities, the development of nationalist ideas and rhetoric, Americans' struggle with the concept of race, and the growth of the politics of race from the Republican Party to the Rainbow Coalition. Wherever possible, we enliven and give authenticity to the story through the words of contemporary participants. With all that, we keep the story concise, fast-paced, and compelling.<br /><br />Within these pages, we try to capture the essence of the African American experience. The book presents African American voices; it sees history through African American eyes. The events and the themes around which these lives were organized are defined so as to impose order on the often disorderly past and to interpret that past as modern historical research has revealed it. The biographical approach both guides the story and animates the history In each chapter, individual African Americans are the pivot points that provide a window on the historical changes of their generation. Life stories capture the rush of events that envelop individuals and illuminate the momentous decisions that, collectively, frame the American past and present.<br /><br />While humanizing history, the biographical approach has another important advantage: It is an antidote to the poisonous notion of historical inevitability. Too often, expressions such as the sweep of history, the transit of civilization, manifest destiny, and the march of progress plant the idea that history is inexorable, unalterable, and foreordained-beyond the capacity of men and women to change. That idea has been used to justify a winner's history-an approach that diminishes the full humanness of those who were captured and traded as slaves. Books with a winner's history approach also work to absolve those who traded in slaves and profited from their labor. To promote the understanding that no individual is forever trapped within iron circumstances beyond his or her ability to alter, we ground every chapter in the experience of people rather than forces.<br /><br />The interwoven human stories in this textbook demonstrate that in every age, in every part of the country, at every level of society, African Americans refused to allow history to crush them. Instead, they were shakers and shapers of their own world insofar as this was possible. Whether in the small space of plantation quarters or Harlem walkups, or criss-crossing a nation, or calling for the unity of Africans dispossessed and dispersed around the globe, African Americans have shaped their world even as they contested and transformed their subordinate roles in American society. That often they did not succeed in their plans or could not fully realize their hopes does not diminish their strivings. It does not alter the fact that for many, nothing was passively accepted; everything was contested or negotiated. The struggle for dignity and respect is part of the human condition. It has been no different for a dispossessed African American minority determined to transcend the contempt of their fellow Americans.<br /><br />Just as African American lives are inarguably part of the long process by which Americans have strived to achieve the promise of the national motto E pluribus unum-from the many, one-so too African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom is not a story set in stone. It is the product of our constantly changing understandings of the past, new insights about historical possibilities, and new historical research. In that ongoing effort, African American history has achieved breadth and depth in recent decades, indeed has become one of the most vibrant components of American history, reshaping the way we understand everything from the American economy to innovations in science, politics, and the arts. Drawing on the last half-century of recast historical narrative, African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom crafts a new synthesis that not only enriches our understanding of the black experience in America but alters our conception of American history in the whole.<br /><br />COVERAGE AND ORGANIZATION<br /><br />In African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom, the distinctive people and events of American history are all here: the Europeans' first encounter with new people and a new environment, the American Revolution and its shaping of humanitarian ideals, the War of 1812, the Missouri Compromise, sectional conflicts, wars from the Civil War<br /><br />through this century's war against terrorism, cultural trends from the resistance poetry of revolutionary-era Phillis Wheatley through modern-day hip hop.<br /><br />African American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom corn-prises twenty-one chapters. Chapters 1-7 explore the period up to 1830, when most Africans in North America were enslaved. The book begins, as all human history begins, in Africa with ancient history and the rise of empires in West and Central Africa during the period American and western historians think of as the Middle Ages. European contact and the growth of the slave trade are followed by an analysis of the new conditions of slavery in the Americas. To understand how Africans were not all enslaved in the same ways and in the same conditions, the chapters treat the formation of notions about race and how they figured in the descent into slavery in different zones of European settlement-French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English-in the Americas. The galvanizing effect of the American Revolution and the decades thereafter during which free black people in the North and in the South built families, founded churches, forged friendships and communities, and struggled for autonomy and dignity arecentral themes.<br /><br />Chapters 8-14 examine pivotal junctures in African American history that parallel the American focus on reform and nationality. The 1830s marked the first years when the majority of black Americans were not forced immigrants but rather born on American soil. Echoing the religious reawakening that undergirded both abolitionism and a vigorous defense of slavery, slave and free African Americans alike claimed their voice in an international antebellum debate about the future of American democracy. Then, through a long and merciless Civil War, the end of slavery, and the South's attempt to recreate the essence of slavery, black Americans persisted in holding forth, before white Americans and the world, the guarantees of equality and citizenship built into the new constitutional amendments. The post-Civil War dispersal of newly freed African Americans to every corner of North America shows how, in the face of a still-hostile white America that abandoned Reconstruction, black people built families, communities, and viable economic lives; established churches, mutual aid and literary societies, and businesses; and launched schools and publishing ventures as they sought to transform themselves from slaves to soldiers and citizens and to wrest equality and justice from white America.<br /><br />Chapters 15-21 address African American life in mod-ern America. We devote attention to the increasing diversity of African Americans and how-during world wars, the Great Depression, and other momentous national and inter-national transformations-they struggled for full participation in a society still marred by racist attitudes and practices.

Sangeeta, John R. Lagraff (CRC Press) excerpt: The primary purpose of this second edition of Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference remains its value as a resource to assist in the preparation of solid state inorganic materials by chemical processing techniques. The idea for a second edition was conceived several years ago in an effort to both add new chemical precursors available to the Materials Scientists and to include existing or emerging topics where materials chemistry plays an important role, such as microelectronics, surface science, and nanotechnology. Additions to Chapter 1 include discussion of the role of materials chemistry in micro- and nano-fabrication, surface materials chemistry, self-assembly, scanning probe microscopy, and carbon fullerenes. The glossary in Chapter 2 contains over 200 new definitions related to the aforementioned topics. Chapter 3 has been greatly expanded to include 50% more new chemical precursors and their properties. The reader is referred to the preface of the first edition (following page) for more information regarding this book.<br /><br />This Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference is meant to be a resource to assist in the preparation of solid state inorganic materials by chemical processing techniques. Ceramic materials can be prepared by a variety of chemical routes and this handbook provides a brief introduction to inorganic materials chemistry and these processing routes, along with definitions of most commonly used terms in the field. The focus of the desk reference is a compilation of property data on inorganic precursors and on inorganic solids to assist in the selection of candidate precursors and materials for a variety of applications.<br /><br />The idea for such a resource for inorganic materials chemistry was conceived from my personal experience with initiating new materials chemistry-related projects, all of which began by necessity with the painstaking effort required to collect relevant information from a multitude of sources, including textbooks, handbooks, journals, proceedings, and magazines. Beginning with my thesis and postdoctoral work on sol-gel processing at the University of Illinois with Professors W. G. Klemperer and D. A. Payne, I found myself devoting a considerable fraction of my efforts to collecting relevant information in the area of materials chemistry. During my work at Battelle in Columbus, Ohio, and subsequently following my move to the General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center, it was clear to my colleagues and to me that there is a pressing need for a resource that not only explains the terms frequently used in the inorganic materials chemistry field, but also provides data on the physical properties of the precursors available for use in chemical processing techniques. Such questions as \\"What precursor can I select to prepare this inorganic solid?\\" and \\"Which precursor (from the processing point of view) is suitable or viable for this process?\\" are the types of questions that scientists and engineers need quick answers to in order to initiate a successful materials chemistry project. This resource provides a rapid reference to help answer these and other such questions. In addition, it provides physical property data on inorganic solids to answer questions such as \\"What kind of properties should I expect from this or similar materials?\\"<br /><br />The desk reference begins with a general introduction to the area of inorganic materials chemistry with an emphasis on chemical processing routes. Several sources of additional information are provided for newcomers to the field and for the experienced practitioners as well. The second chapter provides a quick reference to many commonly used terms in the field of inorganic materials chemistry. The primary purpose of the desk reference, that of providing data on inorganic precursors and ceramic materials, is served in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. The third chapter is a compilation of physical property data on various organometallic, metal organic, and inorganic salt precursors used in the processes described in Chapter 1. The fourth chapter consists of seven sections detailing physical property data on inorganic solids, including oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, selenides, tellurides, and sulfides, among others.pter 3 and Chapter 4.

Examining his accounts of art, truth, morality and eternity, Nietzsche's thought is revealed to be a series of experiments in redemption. However, when placed in direct confrontation with the enormity of modern understandings of destruction, Nietzsche's prescriptions for human salvation look like the imaginings of a more comfortable age. Drawing upon the work of Kundera, Nussbaum, Girard and Cavell, Fraser traces the successive failures of Nietzsche's salvation theology to an inability fully to face the depths of human suffering.<br /><br />Though Nietzsche's powerful attack upon Christianity has remained influential for over a century, few have attempted to mount a sustained theological critique of his thought. Redeeming Nietzsche challenges assumptions of Nietzsche's secularity and opens up a new front in Nietzsche scholarship.<br /><br />Excerpt: One of the most extraordinary things about Nietzsche's reception by theologians in the twentieth century is how so few of them have a bad word to say about him. Barth attacks Nietzsche (though really only in a footnote, albeit a very long one) and so does Milbank (and we shall look at this later), but apart from these two it is hard to think of a major theological voice which seeks to rebut the charges Nietzsche makes against Christianity. Christian theology is not alone in offering so warm a welcome to one so hostile to its fundamental beliefs. Nietzsche wrote that `When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is usually something wrong with her sexuality' yet he has managed to become a fashionable figure in academic feminism. Nietzsche also had nothing good to say about democracy or socialism yet he has been appropriated by leftist movements from the very beginning. Nietzsche is a charismatic figure and everybody wants to be his friend.<br /><br />Over the centuries Christianity has made a habit of appropriating the arguments of non-Christians and turning them to its own purposes. Given the powerful role Nietzsche has had in shaping twentieth-century thought it<br /><br />is unsurprising that Christian theologians have looked to use his work as a theological resource. The way in which this has been done has been to break up Nietzsche for his parts. The aspects of Nietzsche's work that are wholly incompatible with Christian theology are fenced off and (largely) ignored, or cleverly re-interpreted. Thus Christians can join in the general applause of Nietzsche's work. I have tried to suggest in this opening chapter that though there is much to learn from Nietzsche, these fences are not very secure. If Nietzsche is to be used as a theological resource I think the Christian theologian ought first to set about the task of refuting him (best of all, on his own terms). And in order to do this we must try to understand him better.<br /><br />Indeed, isn't his `kind of denial of an existence shared with others' linked to `the murderous lengths to which' Nietzsche will go in order to repress the claim the other has upon him? Could it be that Nietzsche's unwillingness to enter into the suffering of another, that is, his objection to the empathic projection involved with pity, represents an unwillingness not simply to see, but to be seen? Karl Barth seems to be tracking Nietzsche down in precisely this way when he writes:<br /><br />And the true danger of Christianity . . . on account of which he had to attack it with unprecedented resolution and passion . . . was that Christianity - what he called Christian morality - confronts the real man, the superman . . . with a form of man which necessarily questions and disturbs and destroys and kills him to the very root. That is to say, it confronts him with the figure of the suffering man. It demands that he should see this man, thathe should accept his presence, that he should not be man without him but man with him, that he must drink with him at the same source. Christianity places before the superman the Crucified, Jesus, as the Neighbour, ignoble and despised in the eyes of the world (of the world of Zarathustra, the true world of men), the hungry and thirsty and sick and captive, a whole ocean of human meanness and painfulness. Nor does it merely place the Crucified and his host before his eyes. It does not merely will that he see Him and them. It wills that he should recognise in them his neighbours and himself.<br /><br />For Barth, what Nietzsche feared in the other was a reflection of his own suffering humanity. Nietzsche preferred fantasies of (super-human) strength and self-sufficiency to the recognition of human-all-too-human need and fragility. Throughout Zarathustra, Nietzsche's hero is haunted by the crippled dwarf, the little man, the small man. In one of the great emotional climaxes of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, as Zarathustra comes to feel the full force of eternal recurrence, that is, as he is faced with the reality of what he can and cannot affirm about himself, it is the weight of the dwarf (note especially that Nietzsche speaks of the eternal recurrence as `the greatest weight') that restricts his full self-affirmation. In the climax of the passage Zarathustra turns on the dwarf: `Dwarf! You! Or I!' Stanley Rosen interprets this exclamation in this way: `The immediate sense of the image is as follows. Zarathustra can rise no higher until he overcomes the pity for humanity that still pulls him back to the earth below.' In this way Nietzsche's rejection of pity (in so far as Nietzsche and Zarathustra are of a common mind at this point) represents a rejection of, a refusal to acknowledge, any sense of identity between himself and the crippled dwarf figure, suffering humanity. Better to murder the dwarf, to oust him, to sacrifice him even, than to have him make me face my own dwarfness - thus spoke Zarathustra. In rejecting suffering humanity, in casting people as the herd, Nietzsche is seeking to set himself free from the earth below. This begins Nietzsche's disloyalty to the<br /><br />earth; a 'murderous' disloyalty which, for all Nietzsche's emphasis on honesty, is motivated by an unwillingness fully to face the pains and disappointments of his own humanity.<br /><br />Reciprocity, intimacy and marriage<br /><br />As a choice for a final thought on the failures of Nietzschean soteriology 'marriage' may seem odd and strangely out of place. I am aware that some may suspect that this theme introduces an unwelcome spirit of exclusiveness associated with the more conservative elements of Church teaching. This is not my intention at all. I employ marriage, following Cavell, as a way of speaking about the ordinariness of human intimacy that is shared over time and has come to be caught up in a whole pattern of life. Cavell puts it thus: 'questions about marriage . . . are meant as questions about weddedness as a mode of human intimacy generally, intimacy in its aspect of devotedness'.<br /><br />There is, nonetheless, an important theological connection between marriage and ordinariness that is worth underlining. As we have already seen, one of the key dimensions of the Protestant revolution is the celebration of what Charles Taylor calls 'ordinary life'. This revolution marks the transition from a sense of the holy based upon separateness and being set aside, to one in which the holy is seen to be enmeshed in the ordinary and the everyday. And a crucial moment in this transition is the abandonment of clerical celibacy. It is highly relevant that many of the key reformers, including Luther and Cranmer, got married while remaining priests. According to Oberman it is Luther's theology of marriage gained through an exegesis of Genesis 2: 18 that 'is truly epoch making' and at the heart of the Reformation. The celebration of marriage (rather thanseeing it as occasion for regret), at least historically, constitutes a definitive moment in the celebration of the ordinary.<br /><br />In Cavell's thought the ordinary everyday human intimacy that is characteristic of (Cavell's sense of) marriage is counterposed to the tragedy of avoidance. He points to a genre he calls 'comedies of remarriage' - films such as The Philadelphia Story and Bringing up Baby - which pursue the logic (and glitches) of acknowledgment. For whereas avoidance 'does violence to others, it separates their bodies from their souls, makes monsters of them; and presumably we do it because we feel others are doing this violence to us', acknowledgment is the 'release from this circle of vengeance'. And here we are back to Girard.<br /><br />Cavell speaks of marriage as remarriage to emphasise the sense in which 'redemptive' marriage, marriage that institutes cycles of acknowledgement and forgiveness, is constituted by the desire and willingness of each partner repeatedly to remarry each other. Reminding us of the connections with skepticism he writes: 'marriage is an emblem of the knowledge of others not solely because of its implication of reciprocity but because it implies a devotion, in repetition, to dailiness.' This quality of repetition Cavell finds<br /><br />in Nietzsche's notion of eternal recurrence. Of the title `remarriage' Cavell comments:<br /><br />The title registers, to my mind, the two most impressive affirmations known to me of the task of human experience, the acceptance of human relatedness, as the acceptance of repetition. Kierkegaard's study called Repetition, which is a study of the possibility of marriage; and Nietzsche's Eternal Return, the call for which he puts by saying it is high time; this is literally Hochzeit, German for marriage, with time itself as the ring.<br /><br />I have argued that Nietzsche betrays this vision by what I have called a ressentiment against ordinary life. It is a betrayal which leads him away from honesty, away from `the awful truth' (significantly the title of what Cavell takes to be the most impressive of the remarriage comedies). But the 'cyclical' dimension to Nietzschean soteriology is, I think, tremendously important and in speaking of remarriage Cavell reclaims this without succumbing to Nietzsche's own brand of ressentiment.<br /><br />Circling around a similar idea to that explored by Cavell, Rowan Williams, in a sermon preached at the wedding of John and Alison Milbank, speaks of the relationship between truth and love. Williams begins thus:<br /><br />One of the great dramatic points in an old-fashioned wedding was the moment when the bride removed her veil from her face; and whatever the original symbolism of this, it's a remarkably telling sign of what marriage involves. Unveiling, undeception - clear and just vision. John and Alison are promising to look at each other for the rest of their lives, and to be looked at by each other: lovingly, faithfully and, above all, truly and honestly.<br /><br />To begin with, it is worth noting that Williams is speaking here about truth-as-honesty in much the same way as Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, total honesty is only possible alone - for Williams honesty comes through relation-ship; there can be no `total' honesty about oneself that completely by-passes the gaze of the other. Truth requires love just as much as love requires truth.<br /><br />Because there can be no love without truth. Without clear and just vision, love is a business of projection and fantasy. And there can be no truth without love. Without trust and tenderness and courtesy, truth will vanish behind the walls of fear and pain.<br /><br />Nietzsche clearly believes the first of these claims, that there can be no love without truth. As we have seen Nietzsche's own `version' of love is affirmation, and he believes total affirmation of human life is only possible and meaningful on the basis of a full apprehension of life's horror. But Nietzsche never sees the point of the second claim - that there can be no truth without<br /><br />love. Truth can be had for Nietzsche by tough-minded determination, by a rigorous exercise of suspicion. But this suspicion, when pursued as an absolute demand, forecloses upon dimensions of honesty available only to those who are prepared to accept and trust the love of another. The one who is loved is more able to face the reality of their own pain and sense of worthlessness because admitting and facing all of that no longer seems so cataclysmic. Only thus is the wisdom of Silenus fully defeated. Williams sums up: `Truth makes love possible; love makes truth bearable.'istorically, constitutes a definitive moment in the celebration of the ordinary. <br />In Cavell's thought the ordinary everyday human intimacy that is characteristic of (Cavell's sense of) marriage is counterposed to the tragedy of avoidance. He points to a genre he calls 'comedies of remarriage' - films such as The Philadelphia Story and Bringing up Baby - which pursue the logic (and glitches) of acknowledgment. For whereas avoidance 'does violence to others, it separates their bodies from their souls, makes monsters of them; and presumably we do it because we feel others are doing this violence to us', acknowledgment is the 'release from this circle of vengeance'. And here we are back to Girard. <br />Cavell speaks of marriage as remarriage to emphasise the sense in which 'redemptive' marriage, marriage that institutes cycles of acknowledgement and forgiveness, is constituted by the desire and willingness of each partner repeatedly to remarry each other. Reminding us of the connections with skepticism he writes: 'marriage is an emblem of the knowledge of others not solely because of its implication of reciprocity but because it implies a devotion, in repetition, to dailiness.' This quality of repetition Cavell finds <br />in Nietzsche's notion of eternal recurrence. Of the title `remarriage' Cavell comments: <br /> <br />The title registers, to my mind, the two most impressive affirmations known to me of the task of human experience, the acceptance of human relatedness, as the acceptance of repetition. Kierkegaard's study called Repetition, which is a study of the possibility of marriage; and Nietzsche's Eternal Return, the call for which he puts by saying it is high time; this is literally Hochzeit, German for marriage, with time itself as the ring. <br /> <br />I have argued that Nietzsche betrays this vision by what I have called a ressentiment against ordinary life. It is a betrayal which leads him away from honesty, away from `the awful truth' (significantlythe title of what Cavell takes to be the most impressive of the remarriage comedies). But the 'cyclical' dimension to Nietzschean soteriology is, I think, tremendously important and in speaking of remarriage Cavell reclaims this without succumbing to Nietzsche's own brand of ressentiment. <br />Circling around a similar idea to that explored by Cavell, Rowan Williams, in a sermon preached at the wedding of John and Alison Milbank, speaks of the relationship between truth and love. Williams begins thus: <br /> <br />One of the great dramatic points in an old-fashioned wedding was the moment when the bride removed her veil from her face; and whatever the original symbolism of this, it's a remarkably telling sign of what marriage involves. Unveiling, undeception - clear and just vision. John and Alison are promising to look at each other for the rest of their lives, and to be looked at by each other: lovingly, faithfully and, above all, truly and honestly. <br /> <br />To begin with, it is worth noting that Williams is speaking here about truth-as-honesty in much the same way as Nietzsche. For Nietzsche, total honesty is only possible alone - for Williams honesty comes through relation-ship; there can be no `total' honesty about oneself that completely by-passes the gaze of the other. Truth requires love just as much as love requires truth. <br /> <br />Because there can be no love without truth. Without clear and just vision, love is a business of projection and fantasy. And there can be no truth without love. Without trust and tenderness and courtesy, truth will vanish behind the walls of fear and pain. <br /> <br />Nietzsche clearly believes the first of these claims, that there can be no love without truth. As we have seen Nietzsche's own `version' of love is affirmation, and he believes total affirmation of human life is only possible and meaningful on the basis of a full apprehension of life's horror. But Nietzsche never sees the point of the second claim - thatthere can be no truth without <br />love. Truth can be had for Nietzsche by tough-minded determination, by a rigorous exercise of suspicion. But this suspicion, when pursued as an absolute demand, forecloses upon dimensions of honesty available only to those who are prepared to accept and trust the love of another. The one who is loved is more able to face the reality of their own pain and sense of worthlessness because admitting and facing all of that no longer seems so cataclysmic. Only thus is the wisdom of Silenus fully defeated. Williams sums up: `Truth makes love possible; love makes truth bearable.'	2004-11-07

Kramer (Oxford University Press) At least since the publication of Isaiah Berlin's famous essay `Two Concepts of Liberty' nearly half a century ago, political philosophers have argued vigorously over the relative merits of `positive' and `negative' accounts of freedom. Matthew Kramer writes squarely within the negative-liberty tradition, but he incorporates a number of ideas that are quite often associated with theories of positive liberty. Much of The Quality of Freedom is devoted to elaborating the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of particular freedoms and unfreedoms; however, the book's cardinal objective is to establish the measurability of each person's overall freedom and of each society's aggregate freedom. On the one hand, Kramer contends that the existence of any particular instance of liberty or unfreedom is a matter of fact that can be confirmed or disconfirmed without any reliance on evaluative or normative considerations. On the other hand, he argues that the extent of each person's overall freedom or unfreedom cannot be ascertained entirely in the absence of evaluative assumptions. By combining those two positions and developing them in detail, Kramer pits himself against all positive accounts of liberty and most negative accounts. In the course of so doing, he aims to demonstrate the rigorous measurability of overall liberty-something that many writers on freedom have casually dismissed as impossible. Although Kramer concentrates principally on constructing a systematic analysis of sociopolitical freedom, he engages critically with the work of many of the leading contemporary writers on the topic.<br /><br />Excerpt: Having begun with two postulates that delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of particular freedoms and unfreedoms, and having explored numerous facets and implications of those postulates, this book has closed with a chapter-long account of the property of overall freedom. Throughout the volume, a central theme has been the dichotomy between the strictly non-evaluative task of ascertaining the existence of particular freedoms or unfreedoms and the partly evaluative task of measuring someone's overall liberty. Nearly all previous evaluative approaches to the measurement of freedom have failed to heed that dichotomy sufficiently. In a markedly different fashion, Carter too has blurred that very distinction which he himself has done so much to highlight. In his case, of course, the misstep does not lie in suggesting that the existence of particular freedoms or unfreedoms will hinge on evaluative considerations; rather, he goes astray by obscuring the respects in which the extent of anyone's overall liberty does hinge on such considerations. As the second half of this chapter has argued, my conception of each person's overall liberty as a partly evaluative property is not only able to withstand all of Carter's challenges, but is also able to overcome the difficulties that plague his own theory-difficulties that become especially acute in any context where the partly evaluative character of each person's overall freedom becomes especially palpable.<br /><br />Of course, when we recognize that the level of each person's overall liberty is partly determined by evaluative considerations, we are not thereby maintaining that that level is itself a product of moral/political principles. Normative concerns, such as principles of justice, operate not as fundamental determinants of the property of overall freedom but only at a subsequent stage where that property has emerged as a basic distribuendum. The evaluative aspect of each person's overall freedom is not to be conflated with the normative tenor of the principles that prescribe how freedom (or other desiderata) should be distributed. Hence, as has been discussed in my opening chapter, this book sets the stage for normative disputation instead of participating therein directly. Specifically, it sets the stage by elucidating the nature of one of the key distribuenda that will be governed by the principles on which the disputation is focused. I have sought to sharpen that disputation by helping to clarify what it is about.<br /><br />Of course, no clarificatory effort can be entirely unaffected by moral/political considerations. In particular, any theory of socio-political freedom must take a stand on the question whether restrictions created by human beings are in some way to be treated differently from restrictions created purely by natural forces. My own stand on that question-my view that special treatment is indeed essential has been evident since my opening chapter's presentation of the U Postulate and has generated the need for my fourth chapter. What ultimately justifies and is a moral/political premise shows the distinctive importance of the ways in which human actions shape the settings wherein people live and behave. Nonetheless, although such a premise is undoubtedly moral/ political, it is so only at a rarefied height of abstraction. It leaves unaddressed and wholly unresolved the countless issues that are at stake in the normative disputation to which the preceding paragraph has referred. It is a premise that delimits the domain of social and political philosophy without pre-deciding or professing to pre-decide the outcomes of any of the myriad debates conducted within that domain. Thus, although this book has endeavoured at length to analyse one of the foremost concepts in political thought, it is in some respects a prolegomenon to works of political philosophy that go beyond it by entering the aforementioned debates.<br /><br />In relation to normative matters, then, this book has not really sought to supply answers to various questions; it has instead sought to bestow greater precision on some of the questions themselves. In dealing with analytical matters, however, my discussions have been much more assertive. Throughout the volume, the aim has been not only to clarify certain positions on the nature of freedom but also to uphold them and to marshal arguments in favour of them. Those arguments have been oriented in part toward the common-sense comparisons (among people's levels of overall liberty) on which Carter has rightly laid emphasis. They have also been guided in part by considerations of internal consistency and exactitude and capaciousness, with an eye toward the sustainment of subtle and illuminating distinctions wherever possible. Although those standard virtues of philosophical analysis do not in themselves fully determine the direction of one's theorizing, they are indispensable lodestars. Any acceptable theory must partake of them to a very high degree. Finally, the arguments in this book have been oriented towards my paramount objective of presenting freedom as a property that is both rigorously measurable and partly evaluative. That objective, which gains its importance as the means of rendering fully intelligible many of the accounts of justice to which this book serves as a prolegomenon, has shaped a number of aspects of my theory. It has come to the fore, of course, in the current chapter. The first half of this chapter has dwelt more on freedom's rigorous measurability whereas the second half has dwelt more on freedom's partly evaluative character, but the chapter as a whole has attempted to provide a unified analysis of the central concept that structures thus book.

The stories display intelligence, artistry, and creativity as the Choctaw narrators, past and present, express and struggle with beliefs, values, humor, and life experiences. Photographs of the storytellers complement the text. For sixteen tales, the Choctaw-language version appears in addition to the English translation.<br /><br />Many of these stories, passed down through generations, address the Choctaw sense of isolation and tension as storytellers confront eternal, historical, and personal questions about the world and its inhabitants. Choctaw Tales, the first book to collect these stories, creates a comprehensive gathering of oral traditions from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.<br /><br />\\"Choctaw Tales is an admirable piece of work, in its care, its sense of responsibility, and its value to a larger community. Mould's account of his relations with the Choctaw people is impressive and his book can stand as a model of how to pre-sent traditional Native American narratives. Clearly the book will be of great value to Choctaw people and of equal value as an example to Native American people elsewhere?' -DELL H Y M E S, author of \\"In Vain I Tried to Tell You\\": Essays in Native American Ethnopoetics and Now I Know Only So Far: Essays in Ethnopoetics<br /><br />TOM MOULD is a professor of folklore at Elon University and is the author of Choctaw Prophecy: A Legacy of the Future.	2004-11-07

Amstutz (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers) (Hardcover) This book in political ethics explores the potential role of forgiveness in domestic and international politics. Based on philosophical, theological, historical, and political resources, its aim is not simply to investigate the nature and merits of the idea of collective forgiveness but also to explore how an alternative discourse might contribute to the renewal and restoration of deeply polarized societies. The conventional wisdom is that regimes that have suffered from significant atrocities must confront past regime wrong-doing by prosecuting and punishing offenders. But this book, following biblical wisdom and Abraham Lincoln's restorative justice strategy, suggests that social and political healing is not a natural consequence of legal retribution. Rather, Amstutz argues that restoration of communal bonds and the promotion of national reconciliation can only occur when individuals and groups are deeply committed to national solidarity and are willing to treat offenders or enemies as people entitled to human dignity.<br /><br />Theologian Miroslav Volf has argued persuasively that the restoration of ruptured interpersonal and collective relationships presupposes a commitment to community-or what he terms \\"embrace.\\" When conflicts are de-fined in terms of \\"we\\" and \\"them\\" and when antagonists demand justice as a precondition for the reparation of social and political relationships, political healing and social restoration are unlikely to occur. Indeed, when victims demand justice, they may unwittingly reinforce existing alienation and divisions, thereby impairing the healing of social bonds. As a result, if ruptured relationships are to be restored, more than retribution will be required. At a minimum, antagonists must be prepared to acknowledge their shared humanity and be willing to affirm the priority of communal bonds. In this collective healing process, truth telling, acknowledgment of culpability, public apologies, and forgiveness can all contribute to the renewal and restoration of individual and collective ties.<br /><br />The book has two major parts. In the first four chapters Amstutz reviews theoretical and conceptual issues about forgiveness and reconciliation. In the second part, chapters 5-8, Amstutz presents case studies on the limits and possibilities of political forgiveness. Chapter 9, the conclusion, synthesizes major themes and arguments by presenting a preliminary theory of political forgiveness.<br /><br />In chapter 1, Amstutz examines major strategies that regimes have utilized to reckon with past governmental injustices and atrocities. Since forgiveness has been historically viewed as a private, personal ethic, chapter 2 examines key elements of the concept from an interpersonal perspective, focusing on three distinct theories-the classical model, therapeutic forgiveness, and forgiveness as a virtue. Because religion has contributed significantly to the definition and promotion of this ethic, Amstutz explores some important insights about this ethic from a Judeo-Christian perspective. Chapter 3 extends the analysis of forgiveness to the political realm. In doing so, it examines different types of responsibility that arise in political communities and how forgiveness might relate to collective guilt. The chapter concludes with a brief assessment of the limits and possibilities of forgiveness in politics. In chapter 4, Amstutz examines the relationship of justice to political forgiveness, focusing on two major perspectives: Retributive justice, the prevailing approach, provides an effective strategy of pursuing individual accountability but is largely ineffective fostering reconciliation. By contrast, restorative justice-a new paradigm that focuses on the moral reconstruction of political relationships through truth telling, reparations, and forgiveness-provides a more conducive approach to the rehabilitation of broken relationships.<br /><br />In chapters 5-8, Amstutz describes how Argentina, Chile, Northern Ireland, and South Africa have sought to address past collective offenses. The cases illustrate some of the major political challenges in seeking to balance account-ability with the need for collective moral renewal. In the final chapter Amstutz synthesizes major themes and arguments of the book in order to present a theory of political forgiveness. Since legal retribution is consistent with the rule of law, it provides an effective strategy for promoting and protecting individual rights in a context of political order. But when communities are deeply divided and resort to political violence, a communitarian perspective that emphasizes social and political goods may be necessary. Such an approach is desirable because it emphasizes not only the pursuit of the common good but also the restoration of political community. In particular, the communitarian tradition is supportive of restorative justice and the promotion of political healing through strategies of political forgiveness.ive approach to the rehabilitation of broken relationships. <br />In chapters 5-8, Amstutz describes how Argentina, Chile, Northern Ireland, and South Africa have sought to address past collective offenses.

This original study challenges Orientalist text-based scholarship, which has missed these lived practices of Tibetan dialectics. Kenneth Liberman brings these dynamic disputations to life for the modern reader through a richly detailed, turn-by-turn analysis of the monks' formal philosophical reasoning. He argues that Tibetan Buddhists deliberately organize their debates into formal structures that both empower and constrain thinking, skillfully using logic as an interactional tool to organize their reflections.<br /><br />During his three years in residence at Tibetan monastic universities, Liberman observed and videotaped the monks' debates. He then transcribed, translated, and analyzed them using multimedia software and ethnomethodological techniques, which enabled him to scrutinize the local methods that Tibetan debaters use to keep their philosophical inquiries alive. His study shows that the monks rely on such indigenous dialectical methods as extending an opponent's position to its absurd consequences, &#34;pulling the rug out&#34; from under an opponent, and other lively strategies. This careful investigation of the formal philosophical work of Tibetan scholars is a pathbreaking analysis of an important classical tradition.<br /><br />The book is packaged with a CD-ROM that offers photographs of debates; a guide to the participants; a grammar of Tibetan debating, which includes sample propositions, responses, and strategies; the ethnomethods employed by debaters; videos of illustrative debates, complete with English translations, all analyzed in detail in the book; and an appendix comprising an interactive debate, glossary, manual, and illustrations.<br /><br />Excerpt: During two years at Sera over four separate visits, I videotaped some twenty hours of formal debate, mostly on Madhyamaka topics. I prepared for those by reading most of the critical texts involved, in classes and in private tutorials. The best recordings were filmed during the annual public examinations when each debater was being ranked by a panel of senior scholars. Because they were being evaluated, the debaters put their best arguments forward. Also, the other young scholars present, who would usually be shoving their way in to pose their own questions, respected the priority of the examinee's arguments. These debates were relatively short, typically ten minutes in duration; such a short period provided me with technical detail limited enough for me to be capable of mastering. Of these debates I selected fifteen for transcription, guided by their rankings (which were posted), my own judgment of the debate, and the recommendation of colleagues. I translated all of these fifteen debates and spent many dozens of hours analyzing each one, and more frequently hundreds of hours when the time for the transcribing and translation, and showing them to the debaters being filmed and to other colleagues, is included. My field work required three years of residence in monastic universities, and it was proceeded by six years of Tibetan language study. The transcription, rechecking the transcription, making the translation, rechecking the translation, analyzing, posing questions about my analyses, etc., occupied an additional three years. Only after these tasks did the writing begin, which itself was interrupted by heart surgery, and by having to reanalyze some debates, and also by the need to spend two additional years learning the multimedia programs necessary for me to analyze my tapes digitally and to prepare the digital record on the CD-ROM.<br /><br />Even after such a length of time I was faced with the questions, how many debates were enough and how much analysis was sufficient. Many ethnomethodological researchers prefer to analyze a few minutes of microinteraction with terrific care and attention. Feeling responsibile to capture the phenomenon in a way that was ethnographically faithful to the broader phenomenon of philosophical discourse among Gelug scholars, I spread my ethnomethodological analyses over a larger corpus (some 150 minutes or so of debating). I learned that when the phenomena came to be familiar, and even began to be repetitive, I had tape-recorded and analyzed a sufficient number of debates. And when my collection had covered a fair portion of the topics raised in the formal classes I at-tended, I considered that I had done justice to the Tibetans' enterprise. It was only after a thousand hours of reviewing the debates that I began to get a sense for the spontaneity of the negative dialectics that Tibetans practice...<br /><br />Geshe Lhundrup Sopa summarized both the risk and the promise of Tibetan dialectics when he advised, &#34;Just reviewing the arguments as a dead inventory in insufficient. We need to place our minds within the living quandaries that each position faces.&#34; We have observed that Tibetan debating is inhabited by both living sophistries and living quandaries. The criticism that it is more inclined toward dry formalism than other philosophical cultures seems too severe, however. In fact, this criticism is made more likely when the critic her/himself is constricted to a logocentric view of Tibetan Buddhist tenets, a perspective that is deficient in having familiarity with lived reflection in the course of actual formal reasoning. What they see as dry formalism is dry in part because the Buddhologists employ a hypertextual dependency that regards words in a way that is dislocated and disembodied from any lived sense that they may have or come to have. What are assumed to be blindly accepted received notions may in fact be made vulnerable to a path of vigorous dialectics, depending upon the skills of the Tibetan debaters involved. Further, the endless rehearsing of commitments and truisms may be about organizing the local orderliness of the talk and preliminary to what will be philosophically germane.<br /><br />The notion that European philosophy is self-reflective in a more original way is too chauvinist to be taken seriously, for Europeans also have their received notions, and these received notions provide for European thought much of its intelligibility. We have learned that what is logical is also social, and that is necessarily the case for European as well as Tibetan scholars. The determination of when grounds have been given and the dialectics can proceed to other things is in part a social determination. The idea that there can be a pure thinking without any sophistry is unsound, for any thinking requires some formalization, and any formal apophansis will support sophistry.<br /><br />There are important differences between the two philosophical cultures. For one, among Tibetan scholars individualism is less valued as a personal creed or as a methodological practice. It is much like the difference between European and Tibetan painting-Europeans seek an individual style, sign their canvases, and paint self-portraits; whereas, Tibetan painters do not sign their canvases and seek to paint only just like any other expert painter. But is individualism really a necessary requirement for either artistic or philosophical sensibility? I think many European scholars, in a fit of self-aggrandizement, would insist that this is the case, but I doubt that it is. It seems to me that, as Rudy Visker once suggested, a philosopher should neither repeat the obvious nor soar above it. Given this characterization, both philosophical traditions have successes and failures that may be identified.<br /><br />Another European criticism must be taken more seriously, and indeed it has been by most active contemporary Tibetan scholar-monks. This is the criticism, also formulated by Leibniz in his speaking of the balance of reason, that reason should not have any particular agenda. The complaint is that Buddhist dialectics is a journey the destinations of which are too well known; hence, it is not philosophy. Stephen Batchelor, who spent ten years as a Buddhist monk, has complained, &#34;Reason was subordinate to faith. In other words, you only set out to prove what you have already decided to believe,&#34; and there is some truth to his charge. Two Tibetan colleagues of mine once confessed to me, &#34;We admire you Westerners, you say whatever you think just on the basis of your own reasoning.&#34; But it seems excessive to assert that this portrait exhausts the capacity of Tibetan philosophical culture. This study has demonstrated that alongside reasoning with routine forms exists a capacity to sustain intriguing philosophical insights. Any philosophical culture includes this diversity.<br /><br />Georges Dreyfus, a European who also spent a decade as a monk, offers the criticism that &#34;the quasi-canonization of definitions in contemporary Geluk practices manifests an essentialist tendency&#34; that contradicts the anti-essentialism that is at the heart of their philosophical tenets. However true in the deepest possible ways, this again is the living irony of any, and every, philosophical practice. In three of our debates, the debaters offered some truly penetrating insight into the shortcomings of essentialism and the limits of formal analysis, yet in their own philosophical practice each of them violated the spirit of their insight.<br /><br />In debate II.3, the debaters ask whether logical theses are necessary for a realization of emptiness, and they conclude that such theses may be useful but do not guarantee a realization of emptiness. They draw a distinction between &#34;non-dual innate awareness&#34; and formal analytics, but the distinction in itself is formal analytic, and they recognize that it is, and they continue to work formally to establish a universal truth about the matter. In debate II.4, the scholars collaborate in a dialectical examination of essentialism. The clarifier of the reasoning asserts, &#34;When one understands the way of positing how concepts are merely imputations, IT FOLLOWS THAT one does not necessarily realize that concepts are merely imputations. &#62;-&#34; Conceptual understanding and an actual realization are not identical. The respondent concurs, &#34;We speak of a general understanding of the formulation that concepts are merely imputations.... We say that concepts are merely imputations,&#34; and he goes on to argue, echoing Hegel, that understanding a formulation is less than a fulfilled understanding of its meaning or, even more vital, its habitual integration within one's everyday praxis. This latter interest, being the real motive for their philosophical inquiry, ought to serve to reduce the vulnerability of Tibetan philosophical practice to sophistry. However, the practical work of the debaters remains developing a logical discussion about not needing logic. Debate III.2 sustains a brilliant philosophical quandary, and gives no ground to sophistry, even at the price of irresolvable irony. These debaters acknowledge that realizing emptiness requires that one think the unthinkable. The clarifier of the reasoning summarizes,<br /><br />T: Although there the nature of things may be formulated as arising through the force of appearing to the mind, it is not formulated so. It's this way is it not? It is not formulated so, and although the wisdom that realizes just-how-it-is formulates the nature of things through the force of the mind, yah, the wisdom that realizes just-how-it-is does not formulate the nature of things as existing in that way.<br /><br />Even philosophical insight into the meaning of nonessentialism is &#34;a subtle notion that conceals as a customary practice.&#34; And despite such a splendid in-sight, the debaters themselves perform, by means of their apophansis, the work of concealing, in the form of the essentialism of trying to formulate the idea that an understanding of emptiness is not capable of formulation.<br /><br />More simply put, these Tibetan scholars are philosophers, which entails a double helix of original insight and sophistry. The fact that Buddhist philosophy takes for its topic the ways that philosophy betrays itself offers not the slightest protection that it itself will not betray itself every bit as quickly as any other culture's practice of reasoning does. Even great profundities, if they are to be communicated, must be thematized; and thematization leads naturally to betrayals. The founder of the Gelug sect Tsong Khapa formulates this universal human dilemma in a question about the pedagogy for meditation on emptiness: &#34;Although one travels across the sky-like suchness, that mode of traveling-the accomplished being's meditative experience-cannot be described by them. So how, by what witness, will a hearer ever be able to listen?&#34; It seems to be that it is humankind's curse and blessing that once the talk begins, even sky-like insight may be dragged earthward.should not have any particular agenda.

This latter interest, being the real motive for their philosophical inquiry, ought to serve to reduce the vulnerability of Tibetan philosophical practice to sophistry. However, the practical work of the debaters remains developing a logical discussion about not needing logic. Debate III.2 sustains a brilliant philosophical quandary, and gives no ground to sophistry, even at the price of irresolvable irony. These debaters acknowledge that realizing emptiness requires that one think the unthinkable. The clarifier of the reasoning summarizes,  <br />T: Although there the nature of things may be formulated as arising through the force of appearing to the mind, it is not formulated so. It's this way is it not? It is not formulated so, and although the wisdom that realizes just-how-it-is formulates the nature of things through the force of the mind, yah, the wisdom that realizes just-how-it-is does not formulate the nature of things as existing in that way. <br />Even philosophical insight into the meaning of nonessentialism is &#34;a subtle notion that conceals as a customary practice.&#34; And despite such a splendid in-sight, the debaters themselves perform, by means of their apophansis, the work of concealing, in the form of the essentialism of trying to formulate the idea that an understanding of emptiness is not capable of formulation. <br />More simply put, these Tibetan scholars are philosophers, which entails a double helix of original insight and sophistry. The fact that Buddhist philosophy takes for its topic the ways that philosophy betrays itself offers not the slightest protection that it itself will not betray itself every bit as quickly as any other culture's practice of reasoning does. Even great profundities, if they are to be communicated, must be thematized; and thematization leads naturally to betrayals. The founder of the Gelug sect Tsong Khapa formulates this universal human dilemma in a question about the pedagogy for meditation on emptiness: &#34;Although one travels across the sky-like suchness, that mode of traveling-the accomplished being's meditative experience-cannot be described by them. So how, by what witness, will a hearer ever be able to listen?&#34; It seems to be that it is humankind's curse and blessing that once the talk begins, even sky-like insight may be dragged earthward. <br />	2004-11-06

La Lucha Continues: Mujerista Theology by Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz (Orbis Books) Mujerista theology begins with personal experience and moves toward a theology that advances the dignity and liberation of all Hispanic/Latina women. This collection of essays combining personal narratives and theological discourse brings together important insights into the concerns of Hispanic women, the ways in which they can shape theology, and the roles they can take on in the church.<br /><br />Ada Mar&iacute;a Isasi-Diaz, a professor of theology and ethics at The Theological School, Drew University, is author of many articles and books, including Mujerista Theology and En La Lucha: A Hispanic Women's Liberation Theology.<br /><br />Excerpt:This book, La Lucha Continues: Mujerista Theology, the second volume of my essays, is in an attempt to present the theo-ethical elaborations that have occupied me for the last nine years. As was true in the first volume, Mujerista Theology: A Theology for the Twenty-First Century, my goal is to make women and men theologians, the churches, and society at large take note of the religious understandings and practices that are intrinsic elements of the struggles for survival and liberation of Hispanas/Latinas in the USA.<br /><br />An ongoing difficult task for me is to find ways to straddle the academy and the world of grassroot Hispanas/Latinas. My work in the academy-teaching, research, writing-and my work with grassroot Hispanas/Latinas-participating in liturgies and meetings, asking questions about God and meeting everyday obstacles-are very much of one piece. For me it is not a matter of applying what I learn in one of these worlds to the other. I engage in both of them consciously from a liberation perspective. My goal has always been and continues to be to help bring about justice for Hispanas/Latinas, for our communities, and for all oppressed people.<br /><br />Mujerista theology works to contribute, in the name of Hispana/Latina communities and for the sake of all the poor and the oppressed, to the ethical norms that guide society and its future. Our hope has always been to help build open and flexible relationships among all persons and between persons and institutions. These new dialogic, non-competitive relationships provide a firm foundation to create the kind of society we want, one that promotes the welfare of all, with a particular focus on those who are most vulnerable. Only on the basis of such a society can we hope for a truly democratic political regime with institutions and practices that enable the full participation of all its members, a society that leaves no one behind and that carefully guards against a few of its citizens flourishing at the expense of whole other sectors.<br /><br />How does mujerista theology contribute to such a society, to this kind of proyecto hist&oacute;rico (historical project), to this utopian vision? First of all, in mujerista theology utopia does not function to define social structures but rather to indicate theo-ethical understandings, values, norms, and virtues based on the religious beliefs and practices of grassroot Hispanas/Latinas who struggle for liberation in the USA. Hispanas/Latinas' proyecto hist&oacute;rico does not offer details for a political, economic or social model but rather a vision of what should/could be that is \\"sufficiently concrete to provide a guide for action and to elicit a commitment.\\" The proyecto hist&oacute;rico to which we seek to con-tribute is one that challenges present systems considered by the rich and powerful as ultimate, fundamental, permanent. What we seek to do is to insist on alternatives, on possibilities that are open to the unimaginable. We dream of a world beyond the limitations of the present, beyond those restrictions named \\"true universals.\\" Mujerista theology seeks to contribute to the elaboration of \\"reality-based universals\\" open to differences and diversity, seeking to include instead of excluding, reconciling instead of establishing hegemonic understandings that promote the privileges of the few at the expense of the many. The reality-based universals to which we seek to contribute are made up of \\"situated universals,\\" which start with the concrete reality of lo cotidiano and not with abstract understandings of the truth or the application of true universals to a particular situation.<br /><br />Reality-based universals, situated universals give us a firm basis for action and concretize our proyecto hist&oacute;rico. Our proyecto hist&oacute;rico, based on our daily struggle to survive and to live fully, is an action, a practice of resistance. Our reality-based universals lead us to understand that instead of attempting to bring about large changes, what we must insist on are small structural changes, changes taking places at many levels and in many places, changes that will make a difference someday precisely because they take into consideration the personal, the specific, the local. We are bent on changes that set processes in motion and do not seek \\"true solutions\\" because these seem to ignore particularity, diversity and differences. Our struggles give priority to what is needed and useful, to effectiveness on a small scale, at the level of everyday reality. We give priority to creating relationship instead of insisting on changing bureaucratic set-ups that will continue to ignore the personal. Likewise in our theological enterprise, we attempt to bring about fullness of life, committed as we are to hope for and to be open to the irruption of the divine in our everyday lives. Mujerista theology advocates and tries to live an on-going process of conversion that focuses on the need to bring radical change in those every-day, violent, and exploitative practices that oppress and marginalize us.<br /><br />Mujerista theology seeks to contribute to a liberating proyecto hist&oacute;rico by providing insights and understandings regarding norms, values, virtues, and understandings of the divine that are life-giving instead of silencing the cries of the poor. However, we also focus on Hispanas/Latinas as subjects of our own history, as moral agents who have much to contribute and who want to participate actively in bringing about justice for all. At the beginning of the twenty-first century the struggle to survive as moral agents fashioning our own history is ferocious, for we battle understandings that displace persons from the heart of reality and make capitalism and militarism-the market and weapons - the center of reality. Living in a society that continues to promulgate the myth that anyone willing to work hard can \\"make it,\\" Hispanas/Latinas have to be adamant about developing and sustaining dreams and hopes that are not acceptable as part of the present \\"American dream.\\" To do this we have to take responsibility for bringing about change in our lives and in our communities. To be subjects of our own history means that we cannot wait for others to better our lives. Only those solutions achieved by the sweat of our brows, by the work of our hands, and with the convictions that our hopes and dreams give us are acceptable. Living in the richest and most powerful nation in the world makes us all the more prone to look for an individualistic way out of oppressive structures. The temptation to do all in our power to participate in privileged structures, even when it means acting at the expense of our own people, makes our struggle for liberation all the more difficult.<br /><br />Mujerista theology insistence that grassroot Hispanas/Latinas are organic theologians perfectly capable of explaining their religious beliefs and the role these play in their daily struggles is a way of rescuing our thinking, imagination, and consciences from the hands of the dominant culture. Our religious beliefs and practices challenge the rationality of modernity that has so miserably failed the poor and the oppressed. They also challenge the non-rationality of postmodern thought that, though centered on the singularity of each person, proposes an individual-ism beneficial only to the rich and powerful. The non-rationality of individualism is countered by the acknowledgment of human sociality. It is the need for community and the recognition of common interests that moves us to true solidarity. It is precisely Hispanas/Latinas' commitment to family and community that makes hope flourish. However, to maintain the hope so essential to our proyecto hist&oacute;rico, we need to insist on a critical con-science not only about our reality but also about ourselves. \\"We are not subjects of a reality that is apart from ourselves, reality which is at the same time object of our actions. We are both cause and effect of such a world. . . . Therefore, there are no objective changes without a radical transformation of the political subject. There is no change of the political subject without action that radically transforms reality.\\" This is what mujerista theology embraces as its mission when it claims to be a liberative praxis: we seek to transform ourselves as Hispanas/Latinas by taking responsibility for our reality, by seeking to transform it so we can live fully.<br /><br />The essays in this book, then, are simply links in the elaboration of a mujerista proyecto hist&oacute;rico that seeks to transform oppressive reality by sustaining and enabling Hispanas/Latinas' struggle to survive and live fully at the beginning of the twenty-first century in the USA. Honoring our belief that we need to be accountable for our subjectivity, for our hermeneutics, and for demonstrating how our stories and practices intersect with other persons and with societal forces, the first part of this book has three essays that inform the reader about life-experiences that have influenced my worldview. I do not think my life-experiences and my worldview are exceptional or radically different from those of other Hispanas/Latinas. These beginning essays open the door not only to my world but to the world of many other Hispanas/Latinas and provide for the reader a different view into the reality that the rest of the book seeks to explicate.<br /><br />The second part of the book consists of nine essays that articulate a variety of mujerista ethical-theological understandings pertinent to our vision for a just future. They draw from a variety of sources: theology, ethics, literature, philosophy, epistemology, sociology. In each there are methodological understandings that insist on the importance of process, on the fact that how we do what we do influences and even delineates in specific ways the content of our theo-ethical enterprise.<br /><br />All of the essays are directed first and foremost to Hispanas/ Latinas. They are an attempt to give back to Hispanas/Latinas and to our communities what I have heard and learned from them. By sharing with Hispanas/Latinas the information they have given me I seek to enunciate a liberating mystique that will enable us to face our daily struggles and provide us with a sense of community to sustain us in situations we are not capable of facing alone. This book is also directed to other oppressed and marginalized groups in gratitude for what we have learned from them and in the hope that our perspectives and understandings will benefit them in their struggles. In this sense mujerista theology is a praxis of solidarity with other communities of struggle, for we are convinced that unless we build common under-standings and practices among those of us who are marginalized, our communities will continue to be denied access to what they need for fullness of life.<br /><br />This book is also directed to the academy at large, to theologians and ethicists who are committed to base their truth-claims in a reality that excludes no one. It is our contention as mujerista theologians and ethicists that theology and ethics need \\"to transcend the possibility of methodological alienation\\" by always expanding their \\"interpretative horizons.\\" This means that all theo-ethical enterprise has to be in dialogue with as many other theo-ethical perspectives and understandings as possible and always acting with theoretical and methodological rigor. For us, from a liberation perspective, this dialogue has to privilege the voices of the poor and the oppressed. Further, this dialogue has to be a praxis in which theory and practice are inexorably linked. Theology, therefore, is not something we read, study or write but an enterprise: liberative doing, liberative action.<br /><br />This book is an attempt as well to talk to the official church, that is, to church officials in charge of ecclesiastical structures and practices. It presents to them for their serious consideration the religious understandings and practices of Hispanas/Latinas that are part of the on-going revelation of God in our world today. Hispanas/Latinas, who constitute numerically a significant part of the Christian community in the USA, are indeed an important element of the people of God. Yet our religious beliefs and practices are not known and our communities receive little pastoral attention. It is our hope that the elaborations of mujerista theology will reach the clergy in our churches, enlightening them about what Hispanas/Latinas need and want from our churches, what we wish to contribute, and how we want to contribute it so we can indeed feel at home in our churches.<br /><br />Finally, this book is addressed to society at large. Mujerista theology is grounded in Hispanas/Latinas' reality and it seeks to bring about radical change in society that will allow us to free ourselves of oppressive understandings and structures. We can-not overemphasize that mujerista theology is a liberation praxis from the perspective of Hispanas/Latinas but not exclusively for us. Our proyecto hist&oacute;rico is all-inclusive, seeking to transform society and its institutions, including the churches. The space in which mujerista theology seeks to play an effective role is that inwhich Hispanas/Latinas move: the USA society. Our task continues to be a theo-ethical one but because we believe that all history is history of salvation, our theo-ethical scenario is history too. In this effort we contribute a history from the past re-interpreted from the perspective of the vanquished, and a history of the future into which we project ourselves as responsible subjects, as Hispanas/Latinas not afraid to struggle for liberation, for fullness of life.person, proposes an individual-ism beneficial only to the rich and powerful.

Johnson (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers) In Truth without Paradox, David Johnson purports to solve several of the traditional problems of metaphysics-those pertaining to truth, logic, similitude, morality, and God.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Johnson argues against the general acceptability of the schema \\"if p, then it is true that p,\\" claiming thereby to resolve the paradoxes of the liar and of the sorites. In the second chapter, he clarifies what was settled by Quine about \\"truth by convention.\\" In the third, he attempts to shed light on the obscure notion of \\"sameness\\" or \\"uniformity,\\" especially in its application to inductive extrapolation and to the \\"grue\\" paradox. In the fourth chapter, he purports to solve the seemingly insoluble is/ought problem of moral philosophy. And finally, the fifth chapter-which will be of interest to philosophers of religion-contains what the author calls a historical proof of the existence of God, based on a resolution of the lottery paradox.	2004-11-05

Two fundamental questions in this regard are: 1) Why does the Universe exist? (the unrestricted question of existence), and 2) Why does the World exist? (the restricted question of the World). Question 1 is unrestricted because the Universe is defined to include absolutely everything. Question 2 is restricted because the World need not include everything (for instance, it may be thought not to encompass God). Chapters 1-3 deal with the first question in relation to the logic of explanation. Chapters 4-6 deal with the second question in relation to certain ontological presuppositions in explanation.<br /><br />If, as argued in the text, explanation necessarily involves something beyond what is explained, the existence of the Universe cannot be explained. A point of special interest, however, is not just the impossibility of explanation, but the underlying incoherence of the question itself. To establish this point, a theory of explanation and a theory of existence are needed. The principal thesis in the theory of explanation advanced is that the logic of why-explanation is deductive subsumption under a generalization. This furnishes the sense in which explanation must go beyond what is explained. The claim also raises controversial issues about the role of induction in explanation and, generally, about the subsumption analysis of explanation. A detailed analysis of why-explanation is given in chapter 1 to address these issues. Questions about the logical form of reasoning, the foundation of induction, the role of probability in explanation, the relation between explanation and understanding, and the explanation of human action are questions that naturally arise in the course of this analysis. A conclusion of the chapter is that an answer to the unrestricted question of existence is inconsistent with the logic of why-explanation as deductive subsumption under a generalization. When coupled with the claim that every meaningful question is in principle answerable, it follows that the question of existence lacks meaning. Notably, the grounds of this conclusion, which are argued in detail, are distinct from any positivistic principle of meaning.<br /><br />Concepts of total explanation are analyzed in chapters 2 and 3. A total explanation is an explanation that explains everything. Most theories of total explanation are based on the idea that God (or the Universe) is a necessary being (or entity) that has the sufficient reason for its existence in itself. Ideas of necessary being and sufficient reason and their role in Cosmological and Ontological arguments for the existence of God are central interests in total explanation. A complete analysis of these ideas finally depends, however, on a theory of existence, which is given with close reference to the notion of designation. Alternative accounts of total explanation based on theories of extreme axiarchism and explanatory self-subsumption are considered in chapter 3. Though these theories involve unique and interesting issues, they cannot resolve the difficulties in total explanation. To complete the treatment of the unrestricted question of existence, concepts of the Universe and Absolute Nothing are analyzed at the close of chapter 3.<br /><br />Chapters 4-6 primarily concern the restricted question of the World. Unlike the Universe, the idea of the World does not immediately rule out the possibility of something apart from the World. The possibility of explaining the World depends, therefore, on whether there can be something apart from the World that is the cause or reason for its existence. Concepts of creation, theories of divine creation, and possible connections between divine creation and scientific cosmology are relevant to whether the World's existence can be explained. These issues are investigated in chapter 4. The hypothesis that the World is finite in space and time is the topic ofchapter 5. In addition to arguments that the World is spatiotemporally finite, special claims that time itself had a beginning, and that the World is finite yet unbounded are considered. Concepts of body, motion, void, place, space, and time are seen to require careful scrutiny in considering these matters. Chapter 6 concerns the hypothesis that the World is infinite in time or space. When taken together, the arguments of Chapters 5 and 6 prove that the World cannot be finite or infinite in space or time. The significance of this apparent contradiction is shown to indicate that we have no concept of the World as a whole, that it makes no sense to say the World exists or does not exist, and that the World is conceptually and ontologically prior to what exists. These conclusions preclude the possibility of explaining the existence of the World.<br /><br />Excerpt: An aim of this inquiry is to indicate certain logical and ontological limits of explanation. The conception of why-explanation as deductive subsumption under a generalization establishes logical limits of explanation. The fact that our explanations (in matters of existential import) cannot exceed the conditions of space and time establishes ontological limits of explanation. Though the following inquiry into the nature and philosophical limits of explanation was inspired by the question why anything at all exists, a main conclusion of the inquiry is that this question is meaningless. Indeed, the reader may be struck by the number of theses that are argued to be meaningless, incoherent, impossible, absurd, senseless, or by some designation conceptually defective. Since philosophical issues are usually conceptual in nature, error in philosophy is usually a problem of incoherence rather than empirical falsehood. Since words wingless\\" and \\"incoherent\\" often carry derogatory meanings however, the reader is informed that these words are not used or intended in this way in the following work. Although I argue that the question of existence is meaningless, it is a question that has stimulated my own intellectual development. In truth, I have nothing but respect for the question and for the wonder that inspires it in the mind of an inquisitive soul. Philosophical insight does not reside in the assertion or denial of coherence, but only in understanding the reason why.

Tilley (Orbis Books)  Theologians have long tried to solve the problem of faith and history with little success. This book argues that the time has come to dissolve the problem-\\"Both yield fictions; both seek to tell or reveal what is true.\\"<br /><br />After laying out the \\"problematic,\\" Tilley analyzes current approaches to the relationship between history and theology and then shows how they affect faith. He argues that there is no single pattern of relation-ships between the two disciplines and that multiple patterns should be recognized. When accurately understood and properly used, historical investigations, so often construed as undermining faith, do no such thing; indeed, they can actually increase or strengthen faith.<br /><br />Excerpt: This book has four goals. The first is to dissolve the modern problem of history in its \\"history and faith\\" or \\"history and theology\\" versions. The first three chapters of this book are devoted to delineating how the problem of history has been shaped in its modern formulations. Chapter one portrays the shape of the modern problem of history and some attempted resolutions. The modern problematic tended, at least in the Christian and Jewish context, to focus on scriptural texts. Chapter two shows that the literary forms and historic functions of the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible and the Qur'an give rise to different problems of history. The most important reflection on the problem of history was Van Harvey's book The Historian and the Believer, first published in 1966. I discuss this text at length in chapter three. In effect, Harvey fomented a revolution against the classic form of the problem. He argued against the abstract construal of the problem as a general or universal one of faith in tension with history or historical method. He argued for a new focus on the differing particular ways that historians and believers properly formed and warranted their beliefs. Harvey sought to turn theologians away from sterile debates about historical methods and to consider the ways in which historians war-ranted their judgments concerning historical claims and in which believers formed their beliefs. The key tensions were not between history and faith but between historians and believers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, too few theologians recognized the importance of this intellectual achievement. Many continue to attempt to solve or resolve \\"the\\" problem as defined by Troeltsch and his followers as if Harvey had never written. Some reformulate the issues (Tracy 1981; Schillebeeckx 1979; Fiorenza 1984, 31-33) but do so without extensive consideration of what historians actually do. They also tend to be more concerned with the use of historical evidence and argument in the tradition rather than for the tradition, an issue addressed directly in chapter ten. Perhaps Harvey's challenges to business as usual and insights about the problem of history were lost in the glare of the \\"death of God\\" movement in the era in which he wrote. Perhaps the weaknesses in Harvey's sketch of a solution to the problem of the differing intellectual \\"moralities\\" of historians and believers overshadowed his accomplishments.<br /><br />An implication of this book is that Harvey's transformation of the argument from the dualist classic problematic of \\"faith and history\\" to the dualist problematic of \\"historians and believers\\" was not radical enough. Nonetheless, some have learned much from Harvey's work, including the present writer. I read and reread The Historian and the Believer early in my career as graduate student and scholar, and returned to it and read it closely as I began work on the present book and after I had written articles (Tilley 1999; 2001), some of whose arguments have been adapted for use in the present text. I recognize and acknowledge how much his work has influenced my thinking, sometimes without my knowing it-at least insofar as attempting to dissolve the \\"problem of history\\" goes.<br /><br />Some of Harvey's later writings also helped me break down the dualistic or polar pattern of the earlier \\"problem of history\\" problematic and of Harvey's own dualistic contrast of the moralities of \\"the modern historian's principles of judgment and the Christian's will to believe\\" (Harvey 1968, front cover).<br /><br />Chapters four and five argue that the modern problematic of faith and history can and should be dissolved. Chapter four unpacks the unwarranted assumptions that theologians have often made in discussing the relationship of history and theology. Chapter five argues that unpacking claims of Jewish theologian Richard Rubenstein and Christian theologian Marcus Borg shows that historical investigations, often thought to undermine faith, do not do so unless one makes additional philosophical claims not necessitated either by religious convictions or by the practices of historical investigation. The first five chapters are the argument leading to the first goal.<br /><br />The second goal is to understand how history is related to religious traditions beyond the dualistic problematic. Chapters six and seven turn to specific theological issues beyond the modern problematic. Chapter six argues that there are specific religious principles that are immune to undermining by the evidence of history. These principles go far to give religious traditions their identity. The convictions that express those principles are not invulnerable, however, to historical evidence. Additionally, some persons may be in situations that render the convictions that shape their own faith incredible, in part due to the marshaling of historical evidence; that issue is explored more fully in chapter ten. Chapter seven shows the problems that arise when one neglects to distinguish between such identity-giving principles and the historically conditioned convictions that formulate them. A key component of this argument, then, is the distinction between enduring (but rather empty) principles in and of a religious tradition and the particular (and rather robust) articulations of them as operative convictions.<br /><br />The third goal of the book is to attend to the actual practices of historians rather than to the theories of history distilled by philosophers. I have argued elsewhere (Tilley 1995, 5-13, 53-89) that philosophers' distillations of religious propositions from religious practice in a tradition can be misleading. Similarly, I find that theologians dealing with the problem of history rarely, if ever, look at what historians actually do; theologians tend to use philosophical accounts of history and historiography, rather than to examine the practices of history. Chapters eight and nine show the \\"history\\" side of the issue: historians' principles and practices are much more complex and controversial than many theologians seem to recognize. Chapter eight analyzes the extensive disputes over the status of historical claims in light of the collapse of the \\"noble dream\\" of historical objectivity in the twentieth century. The argument there shows, in general, that history qua history cannot easily function as an \\"authorizing\\" discourse; pace the approach of many theologians to the problem of history. Chapter nine analyzes a specific dispute over how to approach the issue of the \\"historical Jesus\\" to show that religious historians are not immune from the progressive loss of the \\"authorizing\\" function of historical investigations.<br /><br />The final goal of the book is to show that the relationships between historical investigations, theological construction, and religious practice are ad hoc rather than systematic. The final two chapters analyze patterns that can be discerned in those relationships, though, since I claim the relationships are ad hoc, I cannot claim to have a complete account of those relationships. Chapter ten argues for a nuanced understanding of the relationship of history and theology. Chapter eleven shows how the problems of history-and theologians' attempts to work with those problems-can affect religious practice and belief. Both chapters presume a \\"practical\\" approach to the problem. As chapters eight and nine looked at the practices and responsibilities of historians, so chapters ten and eleven look at the practices and responsibilities of theologians and believers in light of the contemporary challenges (not the \\"modern problem\\") of historical investigations to theological construction and religious practice and belief. Underlying this work is the fundamental assumption that one's religious commitments have to do not merely with one's belief but with one's life and the practices which give that life structure and which give one's convictions their distinctive meaning (cf. Tilley 1995, 5-57, which argues against the construal, especially in philosophy of religion, of religion as constituted by \\"beliefs\\" or \\"propositions,\\" and argues for an understanding of religion as a set of practices; also see Tilley 2000, 50-87). A final chapter rehearses the argument and claims that it was and is necessary to make this journey.<br /><br />Both history and theology are quite different from what they were seen to be in the mid- to late twentieth century. Hence, it is time to dissolve the problem of history as we have construed it and to reconfigure our understanding of the relationships of historical investigations, theological constructions, and religious convictions. In sum, that is the task of this book.ring (but rather empty) principles in and of a religious tradition and the particular (and rather robust) articulations of them as operative convictions. <br />The third goal of the book is to attend to the actual practices of historians rather than to the theories of history distilled by philosophers.

That they had a horror of even numbers, hence the tendency for months to have an odd number of days? That robed and bearded Celtic druids stand behind our New Year's figurehead, Father Time? That if Thursday is Thor's day, then Friday belongs to Freya, Odin's faithful wife and queen of the Norse gods? That the word Easter may derive from the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring, Eostre, whose con-sort was a hare, our Easter Bunny?<br /><br />Three streams of history created the Western calendar-from the east, beginning with the Sumerians, from the Celtic and Germanic peoples in the north, and again from the east, this time from Palestine with the rise of Christianity. Michael Judge teases out the contributions of each stream to the shape of the calendar, to the days and holidays, and to thelore associated with them. Here he finds glimpses of a way of seeing before the mechanical time of clocks, when the rhythms of man and woman matched those of earth and sky, and the sacred was born.<br /><br />Unlike a watch or a clock, the calendar does not presume to duplicate time. Instead, it serves as a landscape of time, a description not of the thing itself, but of what the thing may mean; a cry not for scientific precision but for emotional understanding. Unlike other timekeeping devices, the calendar is organic: a social contract reminding hurried modern creatures of their debt to nature and to the past.<br /><br />Most people have forgotten, having surrendered their time to mechanisms, why Halloween falls at the end of October, why the birth of Christ is proclaimed in winter's darkness, why Easter and Passover come hand in hand with the spring. Yet it is exactly in answering these questions that we discover a remarkable world, far and yet near, ancient and yet as new as tomorrow's sunrise, where symbol and reality conjoin.<br /><br />I mean this: in late autumn, with the shadows growing, the calendar summons children to carve leering faces into pumpkin flesh; a tribute, though they do not know it, to all of their dead ancestors, returning for one night from the loam, and a reminder, though they need not yet heed it, of the ghosts that they will one day be-come.<br /><br />The calendar fences the latter days of December away from the rest of the common year, commanding the vulgar world to pause and await the birth of the savior and his symbol, the returning sun.<br /><br />The calendar commands that Easter can only occur after the vernal equinox, when Christ returns amid robins and blooming hyacinth, lengthening days, and sudden rains, and, like nature after winter's cruelty, is reconciled to the world.<br /><br />Halloween and the death of the year, Christmas lights shining in the depths of winter, Easter services held at the rising of the gentle spring sun: these things, the simplest things, recall a universe in which we were not strangers. That universe is with us still - in fact it lies one step beyond the stoop. Its story is ours, as old as humanity. Its cast is immense - wind and weather, stars and saints, kings and peasants - and the lead is none other than dear old Mother Earth herself, who waltzes around our sun in stately time, trailing the seasons in her train. Yet for many, that world remains hidden, just out of sense, like the half-heard murmur of an under-ground stream. Uncovering that stream, and inviting you to drink from its waters, is the purpose of this book.t is exactly in answering these questions that we discover a remarkable world, far and yet near, ancient and yet as new as tomorrow's sunrise, where symbol and reality conjoin. <br />I mean this: in late autumn, with the shadows growing, the calendar summons children to carve leering faces into pumpkin flesh; a tribute, though they do not know it, to all of their dead ancestors, returning for one night from the loam, and a reminder, though they need not yet heed it, of the ghosts that they will one day be-come. <br />The calendar fences the latter days of December away from the rest of the common year, commanding the vulgar world to pause and await the birth of the savior and his symbol, the returning sun. <br />The calendar commands that Easter can only occur after the vernal equinox, when Christ returns amid robins and blooming hyacinth, lengthening days, and sudden rains, and, like nature after winter's cruelty, is reconciled to the world. <br />Halloween and the death of the year, Christmas lights shining in the depths of winter, Easter services held at the rising of the gentle spring sun: these things, the simplest things, recall a universe in which we were not strangers.

In this new work, he reveals that science sometimes takes a path through the strange and the ridiculous to discover that Nature often simply does not follow common sense. One experiment, involving a bed, a plat-form scale, and a dying man, seemed to prove that the soul weighed the same as a slice of bread-or roughly 21 grams, as the title of the popular movie put it. But other experiments and ideas that seemed no less fanciful in their time led to the fundamentals of our understanding of movement, heat, light, and energy, and such things as the discovery of electricity and the structure of DNA.<br /><br />As in his previous book, Len Fisher uses humorous personal stories and examples from everyday life to make the science accessible. He includes a catalogue of the necessary mysteries of modern science: the anti-commonsense beliefs that scientists now hold and use as tools in their everyday work. In chapters that feature figures from Galileo and Newton to Benjamin Franklin and Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, among many others, he touches on topics from lightning to corsets and from alchemy to Frankenstein and water babies, but he may not claim the last word on the weight of the soul!<br /><br />Excerpt: This book tells the stories of scientists whose ideas appeared bizarre, peculiar, or downright nutty to their con-temporaries but who stuck to their guns through ridicule, oppression, and persecution. Some of their ideas were nutty, and most of these ideas (though by no means all!) rapidly be-came extinct. Other concepts, seemingly every bit as bizarre, passed every test that could be thrown at them and survived to be accepted and used by scientists such as myself as part of our everyday work.<br /><br />The ideas that scientists now use routinely can still seem ridiculous to people outside science. My wife certainly thought so when she came home one evening to find me riding her bicycle down the road with the wheel nuts removed, explaining to a radio interviewer that the counterintuitive physical laws discovered by Galileo and Newton predicted that the wheels would stay on. Her brief, pungent comment about scientists and their lack of common sense was duly recorded and broadcast on national radio.<br /><br />My wife was right; science and common sense often don't mix. It's not the scientists' fault; Nature is the principal culprit. Those who proposed bizarre-sounding ideas about its behavior were often forced to do so after recognizing that the accepted wisdom, or \\"common sense:' of their eras was simply insufficient to understand what was going on. Their contemporaries, with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, were not always as receptive to new ideas as the popular image of the dispassionate, rational scientist would have us believe, and the fates of those who advanced new ideas ranged from the loss of their jobs to the loss of their lives. Their histories belie the popular image of science as an orderly, logical progression. It is more like a procession, with leaders and followers, which is unwillingly forced to change direction each time it comes up against the barrier of a revolutionary new idea. This book traces the route of the procession through the stories of those who forced the changes and shows how many of their ideas, which seemed to be so at odds with the common sense of the time, are now used by scientists to under-stand and tackle everyday problems. It also reveals the true process of discovery, where the brilliant has often met the bizarre and only the wisdom of hindsight allows us to distinguish between the two. The message is that we need to allow for a certain amount of laughable nuttiness if we are not to lose genuinely original insights and developments. If we can't tell the difference between oddity and insight, then maybe it's wise not to laugh too loud.<br /><br />I am a scientist, not a historian, and when I write about scientists from earlier times it is from my perspective as a scientist. In consulting copies of original diaries, papers, and notes, I have often found I was reading about people who thought in the same way that modern scientists do but who happened to be working with a different set of questions and in a different environment of belief about the way in which the world works. I was particularly struck to discover the parallels between their struggles to understand how Nature works and my own efforts (rather less successful) as a child to understand for myself everything from movement, studied by Galileo, to light, space, and time, elucidated by Einstein. I have included some tales from this part of my life, partly to show that thinking like a child isn't necessarily a bad thing when it comes to science, and mainly to show that you don't have to be a genius to understand science - it just needs persistence, and the wish to know.ws us to distinguish between the two.

Field, Richard E. Behrman (National Academies Press) In recent decades, advances in biomedical research have helped save or lengthen the lives of children around the world. With improved therapies, child and adolescent mortality rates have decreased significantly in the last half century. Despite these advances, pediatricians and others argue that children have not shared equally with adults in biomedical advances. Even though we want children to benefit from the dramatic and accelerating rate of progress in medical care that has been fueled by scientific research, we do not want to place children at risk of being harmed by participating in clinical studies.<br /><br />Ethical Conduct of Research Involving Children considers the necessities and challenges of this type of research and reviews the ethical and legal standards for conducting it. It also considers problems with the interpretation and application of these standards and recommends steps that researchers, government agencies, and others can take to improve research conduct. The book argues that a robust system for protecting human research participants in general is a necessary foundation for protecting child research participants in particular. The report looks at the need for appropriate pediatric expertise at all stages of the design, review, and conduct of a research project to effectively implement policies to protect children.<br /><br />Those who care about and for children currently face a dilemma. We want children to benefit from the dramatic and accelerating rate of progress in medical care that is fueled by scientific research. At the same time, we do not want to place any children at risk of being harmed by participating in such research, even though their very involvement may be essential to improving the overall medical care of children. We also want to discourage research that is of minimal value. The concern is how best to balance these potentially conflicting objectives. Five important considerations should guide us as we seek to resolve our dilemma.<br /><br />First, because of the inherent vulnerabilities arising from their immaturity, infants, children, and adolescents need additional protections beyond what is provided to competent adults when they participate in research. This principle underlies all others.<br /><br />Second, the design of the research required to improve the health and well-being of infants, children, and adolescents must consider their physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. Similarly, when children of any age become participants in such research, the protections provided must be appropriate to their stages of development.<br /><br />Third, sharing in the advances in medical care for this vulnerable group includes a special emphasis on protecting them from harm caused by standard medical procedures and treatments based on research with adults when the benefits and risks for children of different ages have not been established through scientific research involving these populations. Except<br /><br />when it is not feasible or reasonable, research with animals, and adults should precede studies with children to minimize research risks.<br /><br />Fourth, the system for protecting infants, children, and adolescents involved in research, while ensuring such protection, should not unreason-ably impede research that may benefit them. The contribution of rules and regulations to desired outcomes as well as possible unintended negative consequences should be considered.<br /><br />Finally, all of those responsible for research involving infants, children, and adolescents need to understand the special ethical issues that are relevant to the conduct of such research and the additional protection that must be provided. In certain cases, ethical standards will preclude some otherwise desirable research.<br /><br />Overall, a satisfactory resolution of our dilemma can be achieved. Children involved in research can be appropriately protected as well as share fairly in the increasing benefits of biomedical science. This report suggests ways to balance sometimes conflicting objectives in ways that will contribute to children's health and well-being now and in the future.ildren involved in research can be appropriately protected as well as share fairly in the increasing benefits of biomedical science.

Blank (National Academes Press) Many racial and ethnic groups in the United States, including blacks, Hispanics, Asians, American Indians, and others, have historically faced severe discrimination-pervasive and open denial of civil, social, political, educational, and economic opportunities. Today, large differences among racial and ethnic groups<br /><br />., continue to exist in employment, income and wealth, housing, education, criminal justice, health, and other areas. While many factors may contribute to such differences, their size and extent suggest that various forms of discriminatory treatment persist in U.S. society and serve to undercut the achievement of equal opportunity.<br /><br />Measuring Racial Discrimination considers the definition of race and racial discrimination, reviews the existing techniques used to measure racial discrimination, and identifies new tools and areas for future research. The book conducts a thorough evaluation of current methodologies for a wide rage of circumstances in which racial discrimination may occur and makes recommendations on how to better assess the presence and effects of discrimination.<br /><br />Excerpt: In the United States, large differences among racial and ethnic groups characterize many areas of social, economic, and political life, including such domains as the criminal justice system, education, employment, health care, and housing. For example, racial differences-which generally disadvantage minorities-exist in arrest and incarceration rates, earnings, income and wealth, levels of educational attainment, health status and health outcomes, and mortgage lending and homeownership. There are many possible explanations for such differences; one explanation may be the persistence of behaviors and processes of discrimination against minorities.<br /><br />In this context, the Committee on National Statistics convened the Panel on Methods for Assessing Discrimination in 2001 to define racial discrimination; review and critique existing methods used to measure such discrimination and identify new approaches; and make recommendations regarding the best of these methods, as well as promising areas for future research. Because of wide interest in this topic, several funding agencies sponsored our study: the Ford Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Education.<br /><br />The work of this panel is a direct outgrowth of the project that resulted in the two-volume report America Becoming: Racial Trends and Their Consequences (National Research Council, 2001a). Several of the panel members who were involved in producing these volumes held conversations around the question \\"What do we need to know to understand more about the role of race in American society?\\" At least one answer was<br /><br />\\"We need better methods to identify and understand the effects of race-based discrimination.\\"<br /><br />The panel comprised a diverse group of experts in the fields of criminal justice, law, economics, psychology, public policy, sociology, and statistics. This diversity added a great deal to the creative debates among the panel members but also added to the difficulties in writing this report. It took time to develop a language and an intellectual framework with which we were all comfortable. In our report, we provide an extended discussion of definitions of discrimination and race, consolidating many aspects of a large social science literature on these topics. We also discuss various approaches to modeling and measuring discrimination in different fields. The interdisciplinary and diverse nature of the panel helped broaden these discussions, and we hope that our presentation of the definitional issues provides insight to those interested in the conceptualization of discrimination, just as we hope that our discussion of the methodological issues introduces new ideas to thoseengaged in measuring discrimination.<br /><br />The breadth and complexity of the topic of discrimination and its effects posed a challenge for maintaining a tight focus on our charge, which was to define discrimination and review methods for measuring it. To keep to that charge, we spend no time discussing policies intended to alleviate discrimination (such as affirmative action or programs to build recruitment pools). We acknowledge, however, that the panel members have diverse opinions about appropriate policy options to address problems of discrimination, and inevitably our debates over policy issues at times crept into our debates over methodological issues.<br /><br />Because of the charge and constraints on our time and resources, we focus our analysis on racial discrimination, particularly discrimination against African Americans, for which there is a very large literature. We do not address discrimination on the basis of nonracial factors, such as gender or age, nor do we discuss so-called reverse discrimination. Under the rubric of racial discrimination, we do include discrimination against ethnic groups, particularly Hispanics. The reasons have to do with the discrimination that has affected them coupled with the blurred nature of the definition of race and ethnicity for many Hispanics.<br /><br />All of the panel members recognize the difficulties in defining racial discrimination in a clear way and in finding credible ways to measure it. There are different types of discrimination, different venues in which it can occur, and different ways in which it can have an effect. This report cannot address all of these topics comprehensively, but we have attempted to focus on at least some of the more important definitional and measurement problems. The measurement issues we address are relevant for understanding and measuring other types of discrimination. Despite the difficulty of ourtask, the panel members are all persuaded that accurate methods to identify and measure discrimination are highly important, and as scholars and re-searchers, we were committed to carrying out our charge in the best way possible.ination. <br />The breadth and complexity of the topic of discrimination and its effects posed a challenge for maintaining a tight focus on our charge, which was to define discrimination and review methods for measuring it.

Most texts on the subject, however, are written at the graduate level for those with strong mathematics, economics, or business backgrounds.<br /><br />In a clear and refreshing departure from this trend, Introducing Game Theory and Its Applications presents an easy-to-read introduction to the basic ideas and techniques of game theory. After a brief introduction, the author begins with a chapter devoted to combinatorial games-a topic neglected or treated minimally in most other texts. The focus then shifts to two-person zero-sum games and their solution. Here the author presents the simplex method, based on linear programming, for solving these games and develops within his presentation the required background in linear programming. The final chapter presents some of the fundamental ideas and tools of non-zero-sum games and games with more than two players, including an introduction to cooperative game theory.<br /><br />Excerpt: This book will not only satisfy the curiosity of those whose interest in the subject was piqued by the 1994 Nobel Prize awarded to Harsanyi, Nash, and Selten. It also prepares its readers for more advanced study of game theory's applications in economics, business, and the physical, biological, and social sciences.<br /><br />This book is intended to be an easy-to-read introduction to the basic ideas and techniques of game theory. It can be used as a class textbook or for self-study. It also could be helpful for students who must learn some game theory in a course in a related subject (such as microeconomics) and have limited mathematical background.<br /><br />In recent years, and especially since the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded in 1994 to John C. Harsanyi, John F. Nash Jr., and Reinhard Selten for their research in game theory, people have been intrigued by the unusual connection between games and mathematics, and the author hopes that this curiosity may be satisfied to some extent by reading this book. The book also will prepare them for deeper study of applications of game theory in economics and business and in the physical, biological, and social sciences.<br /><br />The first part of the text (Chapter 1) is devoted to combinatorial games. These games tend to be more recreational in nature and include board games like chess and checkers (and even a simple children's game like Tic-Tac-Toe). There are also many such games that are challenging even for accomplished mathematicians and our study covers various clever techniques for successful play. The rest of the book deals with the general theory of games. Chapters 2 and 3 contain a thorough treatment of two-person zero-sum games and their solution, which is the most well-understood part of game theory and was developed from the 1920s through the 1950s. John von Neumann was responsible, almost by himself, for inventing the subject, which reached its climax with the elaboration of the simplex method. Chapter 4 introduces the reader to games that are not zero-sum and/or involve more than two players. Here it is often natural to consider cases where the players must no longer act as isolated individuals but are permitted to form coalitions with other players. Games in which this happens are called cooperative games. All of this is an area of current research and there is still no general consensus about its concepts, methods, and applications. Here we have only attempted to present the basic ideas and some of the less controversial results, so that readers can venture further on their own. The reader will find in this chapter some of the applications that make game theory so interesting, for example, in economics, in the theory of political power, and in evolutionary biology. We assume no previous acquaintance with the details of these subjects. Our treatment is intended to provide enough of the fundamental concepts and<br /><br />techniques of game theory to make it easier to understand more advanced applications.<br /><br />There are three Appendices. Appendix 1 reviews finite probability theory and provides whatever is necessary to understand all applications of probability in the book. Appendix 2 sketches an axiomatic treatment of utility theory. Although the utility concept is necessary for a proper understanding of game theory (and economics in general), we have avoided dealing with the subject in the body of the text because it would be a difficult and unnecessary distraction for the readers in their first confrontation with game theory. Appendix 3 contains two proofs of Nash's Theorem on the existence of Nash equilibria. The reason for consigning them to an appendix is that they depend on sophisticated results from topology, with which many readers will not be familiar.<br /><br />The section of Answers to Selected Exercises contains brief solutions to enough of the exercises for the readers to be sure that they understand what is going on, and then usually leaves some exercises to be answered on their own. There is an extensive Bibliography that contains not only the articles and books referred to in the text, but also many readings that may attract the readers' interest and extend their knowledge.no previous acquaintance with the details of these subjects.

By drawing upon the literary and the historical data available concerning the church in Rome, Spence seeks to discover when and how Christians came to see themselves as an identifiably distinct community. His findings will surprise those who see the \\"Parting of the Ways\\" as a slow process. He argues that although the \\"parting\\" was early, it was not without its complications. Drawing upon the work of Rodney Stark, a sociologist of religion, Spence suggests that within the church in Rome there was a struggle between those who saw the church as a Jewish sect and those who saw the church as a Roman cult - a struggle already under-way when the Apostle Paul wrote Romans. This struggle, however, was not an even one, because it was the cultists, those for whom the church's primary social location was the pagans of Rome, who held the positions of power over the numerically smaller sectarians who sought to maintain the church's primary identity as a Jewish sect acceptable within the synagogues of Rome.<br /><br />Stephen Spence was born in Scotland and raised in Australia. He has degrees from Melbourne University, Asbury Theological Seminary, the Bible College of Victoria, and a Ph.D. from Fuller Theological Seminary. In 1997 Stephen was appointed to the position of Lecturer in New Testament and Theology at Burleigh College (Adelaide, South Australia) and in 2001 he was appointed Principal. He is married to Colleen and has two teenaged children, Elissa and Jordan.<br /><br />Excerpt: It is the goal of this study to bring into focus what is often left in the background when the New Testament is studied - the struggles of a new religious movement to establish itself as an independent community. It has long been our conviction that each New Testament document addresses this struggle at some level, and to read these documents as if the Church as we have come to know it was already a conceptual, if not social, reality would be to seriously misread them. Not surprisingly, this anachronistic practice is epidemic among the members of today's Church. However, we believe that this practice can still be found in many current New Testament studies. Even when there is recognition of doctrinal development through the New Testament period, there is little recognition both of the social development of the Christian community and of the impact that this would have had upon the theologising of the early church.<br /><br />It is the intent of this study to consider the social development of one particular Christian community: the church in Rome.' This community was not chosen because it is representative of all the developing churches of this period; no church could function in this role. The historical and social accidents of each individual church are too great to generalise from one to another. Neither was this community chosen because the evidence available is complete; it is barely adequate, even though it is as plentiful as that of any first-century church. The church in Rome was chosen because the evidence associated with it provides us with an opportunity to see the changes that time brought. Snap-shots of the church in 49 C.E., in 57 C.E., in 64 C.E., and then around the end of the century, when juxtaposed, provide us with some sense of this community's development. Of course, juxtaposing does not tell the tale by itself. The connections that are made and the implications that are drawn from these connections owe themselves to the interpreter's under-standing of how such a new religious movement might be expected to develop.<br /><br />This study, then, mustnot only undertake the task of historical analysis but also that of sociological reconstruction. It is not a case of whether or not an investigator of the early church chooses to use sociological theory in this process, but a case of whether or not they will be explicit in their use of it. It is for this reason that we have chosen to investigate various theories associated with analysing sects and cults. This field within the discipline of the sociology of religion is a developing one, and it is our hope that the work presented here will contribute to a better-informed use of sect-theory.<br /><br />The church in Rome has already been the object of much study, so it is unlikely that our observations or our conclusions will provoke much surprise. Yet, we believe that the observations made will con-tribute to a better understanding of the church in Rome, that the methodology employed will contribute to a better understanding of the significance of these observations and that the conclusions reached will suggest new possibilities for how we read the texts associated with this particular developing Christian community.rtake the task of historical analysis but also that of sociological reconstruction.

Hawkins (Longman) Introduction to Asian Religions provides a straightforward and accessible overview of the religions of Asia, including Islam.<br /><br />Features of Introduction to Asian Religions<br /><br />* Geographically organized into three major areas: South and Southeast Asia (including Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Indonesia); China; and Northeast Asia (including Japan and Korea).<br /><br />* Covers all major Asian religions found in these regions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, Daoism, Shinto, Islam, and newer religious movements.<br /><br />* Includes extensive coverage of Islam and its historical and contemporary place in Asia.<br /><br />* Primary source material from each major religion gives students familiarity with the religious literature of each tradition.<br /><br />* Numerous full-color photos and art-both historical and contemporary-provide insight into the artistic expressions, sacred architecture, and people of the various traditions.<br /><br />* Photographs of contemporary rituals and practices give a feel for each tradition as a living religion.<br /><br />* Numerous maps provide valuable geographical and historical context. Relevant Web site URLs are provided at the end of each chapter, directing students to the Web for further research and information.<br /><br />* A combined glossary and pronunciation guide at the end of the book further help make the religions of Asia accessible to students.<br /><br />Excerpt: I must admit at the outset that I am old-fashioned. While I applaud the myriad of new teaching materials such as audio-visual material, computer programs, the Internet, and the like that are now available to teachers of religion, I firmly believe in the Asian concept that the most meaningful educational experiences are the result of a personal interaction between student and teacher. It is this philosophy that has guided the writing of the present text. It is self-evident that no textbook of any manageable size could be written that would exhaustively treat the magnificent diversity of Asian religious experience. Choices of methodological emphasis, what topics are to be included or excluded, to what depth these topics should be treated, and to what extent one should involve the beginning student in an examination of the many still unresolved scholarly debates associated with the study of Asian religions are all questions that need to be considered when deciding how to structure the tremendous mass of data available on the religions of Asia. Clearly, instructors of the subject will hold different opinions on all of these issues.<br /><br />Moreover, every class is unique in the mix of its students and the specific expertise of its instructor, not to mention the necessity of contending with the numerous unexpected factors that affect the conduct and evolution of each individual class from term to term. It is impossible to predict what aspects of the study of the Asian traditions will fire the imagination of the students and emerge at any given point as a living concern in the classroom, either for an individual or the group at large. Instructors must be the facilitators and sculptors of this educational experience, since they mediate between the purely intellectual facts of the study and the dreams, aspirations, and concerns of the students. It is through the teacher's inspiration and technical knowledge that students transcend the dry facts of Asian religion and come to understand it for what it truly is-a vital and living force in the lives of much of the human race.<br /><br />This text, then, is designed to support the instructor's efforts in bringing the Asian religions to life for the students who will use it. As such, it makes no pretense of being exhaustive in its treatment of Asian religious phenomena, nor of being \\"inspirational\\" in its own right. Rather it aims at providing a framework within which instructors are freeto develop their exposition of the material in the manner most appropriate to their own expertise and inclinations, and the conditions of their individual classrooms. With this goal in mind, I have chosen to present the religions of Asia in a primarily historical manner. As a historian of religion I believe that, far from being a static ahistorical phenomenon, religion is a living and evolving organ-ism, and that examination of the overall historical development of the Asian religions is the clearest way for the beginning student to gain an overview of these thought systems and their place in their societies. Readers of this text will also find that my presentation is conditioned by the assumption that religions are both influenced by the physical and social environments in which they develop and in turn influence those environments.<br /><br />This should not be taken to mean that I hold the reductionist viewpoint that all religion is nothing more than an outgrowth of human society and the human psyche. But given the intellectual boundaries within which the process of academic analysis takes place, scholars are committed to working with data as it presents itself, and it must be recognized that data can often be interpreted from a secular materialist point of view as well as in a spiritual manner. Nor does this method of interpretation necessarily negate the transcendental origins and possibilities advocated by the religious traditions themselves. As my grandfather used to observe, \\"The Lord moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform.\\"<br /><br />Even though the text is primarily structured along historical lines, the tremendous mass of information demands further organization. Consequently, I have divided the book into three main sections-South and Southeast Asia, China, and Northeast Asia. The pan-Asian religions such as Shamanism and Islam are examined at appropriate points throughout the narrative.<br /><br />Such wide diversity of geographic and cultural areas creates considerable challenges in transliterating the various languages of Asia into English. Since this is a textbook for beginners, I have chosen to use simple phonetic transliteration for the Indic languages. (In more advanced texts, Indic terms and names are transliterated using the excellent system that has been developed for these languages.) Likewise, I have simplified the transliteration of most of the other Asian languages encountered in the text. For Korean, I have adhered to the McCune-Reischauer system with the exception of using \\"&ouml;\\" and \\"&uuml;\\" to indicate the short sounds of those vowels. In the case of Chinese, I have used Pinyin; however, since so many seminal books on Chinese religion use the significantly different Wade-Giles system, I have also given that form of transliteration when words or names are encountered in the text for the first time.<br /><br />We live in a world full of electronic information resources, and present-day instructors and students of Asian religions have an immense volume of multimedia material no further away than their computers. I have chosen to use some of these newly available resources to construct what one might describe as a \\"counter text.\\" Whereas the printed text concentrates primarily on the systematic presentation of the historical and intellectual development of the Asian religions-subjects that are treated very unevenly in the Internet material that I have reviewed-most of the electronic sources quoted in the text are linked to sites that give the students the \\"feel\\" of the various religions. This material will hopefully convey a fuller under-standing and appreciation of the non-intellectual components of the various Asian traditions that make them so appealing to their devotees. It is where phenomenological information on festivals, rituals, and so forth is to be found, and here many of the literary and artistic expressions of the various religions are presented. Writings drawn from the variousreligious traditions of Asia are also printed at the end of this text, to provide immediate access to a representative selection of primary sources.ges of Asia into English.

He explains that the Qabalah is the root source of all Western mystery traditions-Kabbalist, Rosicrucian and Sufi-as well as the more modem, classic Western systems, such as the tarot, alchemy, angelology, and ritual magick.<br /><br />This is an experiential guidebook that explores Qabalah - \\"the Yoga of the West\\" - as a methodical system of spiritual enlightenment, providing exercises, meditations, visualizations, and prayers so readers can experience Qabalah directly.<br /><br />David Goddard is a Lineage-Holder and teacher of the Mystical Tradition of the West. He travels extensively, teaching internationally. His work enables others to experience directly their own divine consciousness, as well as to assist in healing the suffering of individuals and their communities. Goddard is the author of The Tower of Alchemy and Sacred Magic of the Angels. He lives in England.<br /><br />Excerpt: I have often been asked: Is Qabalah a religion? It is not. Qabalah is a spiritual tradition. Religion and spirituality are not the same thing. Religion is a means to get to a certain state of knowing gnosis. Spirituality is the state you are in when you get there. A spiritual practitioner is one who has come to know the realities that religious scripture and imagery indicate-directly, if imperfectly. The knowledge is imperfect because it involves realities that transcend form and dualistic thinking.<br /><br />This is very important to grasp. Religious image and scripture are metaphorical not literal; they need to be perceived wisely as poetic allegory, not as concrete fact. All religions, without exception, are time-fettered attempts to communicate with (and label) the inexpressible. Once you grasp this, you automatically move into a stance where you look for what you have in common with other religious expressions. If, however, you read your own religion as \\"prose\\" instead of as poetry, you automatically demonize others whose religious images conflict with your own deeply held beliefs.<br /><br />We see this in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, where three world religions-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (all derived from Abraham)-cannot tolerate one another because they each have different names and myths for the same deity. In the 21st century, it is time we outgrew such things. Such views cannot help us realize the Transcendent Mystery for which the term \\"God\\" is a metaphor.<br /><br />A realized spiritual practitioner can worship with other people in any setting-synagogue, church, mosque, temple, or grove-because they have learned to be conscious of the Divine in all places and in all beings. This is represented by the esoteric aphorism that teaches, \\"Mock not the name by which another knows God.\\"<br /><br />Skillfully applied, religion can be useful to spiritual practitioners by helping them communicate with others who use the same imagery or share the same associations. But we need not be bound by its practices. We choose it only because it is helpful. As with any tool, when it has done the job, we lay it aside. Or we may retain it for its inherent beauty, like a picture or a piece of music we personally find inspiring. The important thing is that we not impose our preferences on others or judge them by whether they like or dislike that picture or piece of music. Having \\"tasted\\" the One Reality, the truly spiritual personis no longer attached to religion, but rather sees it for what it is and continues forward to actualize that which religion can only suggest.r attached to religion, but rather sees it for what it is and continues forward to actualize that which religion can only suggest. <br />	2004-09-29

Olsson (Philosophical Studies Series, V. 95: Kluwer Academic) The authors who have contributed to this book were asked to take a closer look at Lehrer's epistemology from their own different perspectives. Many are, of course, critical; that is in the nature of the game. But the reader will also find several constructive attempts to defend or improve on Lehrer's theory. In the final essay, Lehrer gives his replies. All articles appear in this volume for the first time.<br /><br />After a survey Introduction by the Editor which outlines the main outlines of Lehrer' views the contributing essays are group under five topics.<br /><br />1.  The first topic, Externalism vs. Internalism, Ernest Sosa, \\"Epistemology: Does it Depend on Independence?\\" attempts to clarify and question the way coherentism undermines supervenience arguments but possibly may also undermine its own rationale by only using supportive arguments for independence without supervenience.<br /><br />In \\"Why Not Reliabilism?\\" John Greco raises the question why isn't agent reliability enough? Or better, why does knowledge require, in addition to agent reliability, further conditions regarding coherence? In pursuing this question, Greco considers Lehrer's three most important arguments for thinking that agent reliability is not enough, and that therefore something further is required, such as coherence. Greco argues that none of Lehrer's arguments against a non-coherentist version of reliabilism is persuasive.<br /><br />Knowledge has a functional role in science and in practical reasoning, and this functional role requires abilities involving articulation, reason-giving, and defense against objections. Hence the grounds of knowledge must be in an appropriate way available to the knower, as they are in a coherence theory.<br /><br />Externalism in general, and reliabilism in particular, are open to \\"the opacity objection.\\" More specifically, they are open to counter-examples such as that of Mr. Truetemp, in which a) the person in question is reliable in what he accepts, but b) this reliability is opaque to him. Contra reliabilism, such persons lack knowledge. However, coherence removes opacity and thereby issues in knowledge.<br /><br />Greco argues something like this: Depending on how we interpret Lehrer's conditions for coherence, we must say either a) that Mr. Truetemp satisfies those conditions and therefore knows, or b) that in ordinary cases of perception, people do not satisfy those conditions and therefore do not know. If (a), then the counter-examples employed by the opacity objection fail to distinguish Lehrer's coherentism from non-coherentist versions of reliabilism. If (b), then Lehrer's coherentism has unacceptable skeptical results.<br /><br />Gettier problems show that true reliable acceptance is not sufficient for knowledge. However, coherence requires further conditions, and these work so as to solve Gettier problems. Greco argues that a non-coherentist version of agent reliabilism can adopt a strategy very similar to Lehrer's so that his arguments are not persuasive.<br /><br />Jonathan L. Kvanvig in \\"Justification and Proper Basing,\\"  believes that there is more to be said on behalf of Lehrer's view that a causal account of the basing relation is defective than has been appreciated. Causality is ubiquitous in nearly all of our experience of the world, but it is not conceptually involved in the concepts of knowledge or justification. In particular, Lehrer is right that the basing relation is not a species of causal relation. Kvanvig attempts to show why.<br /><br />Todd Stewart in \\"Lehrer on Knowledge and Causation\\" takes up the same situation, arguing that Lehrer's theory of knowledge as it stands remains silent about the relationship of causation to justification. \\"Indeed, it seems possible to easily accommodate the view that causation is necessary for justification by simply understanding reasonsclaims as always being partly causal. Causation would enter the picture here because it is explicitly represented in reasons claims, and improper causation can make such reasons claims false. Of course, Lehrer's theory is also compatible with the view that justifying reasons need not be causal. Whether the incompleteness of Lehrer's theory is a virtue or a vice, and both the flexibility and difficulty of assessment this incompleteness reveals\\" is left up in the air.<br /><br />Lastly Volker Halbach in \\"Can We Grasp Consistency?\\" attempts to show that the arguments proposed to prove that consistency is as hardly accessible as purely external facts are not conclusive. Of course, consistency is not accessible, if `accessible' is understood in a very strong way, for general procedures for determining whether an arbitrary given set of sentences is consistent has not been formalized. But this kind of accessibility is not required for most epistemological purposes. For those purposes, we only need to establish the consistency of our own belief system or the consistency of our belief system with another belief. Which the bedrock of Lehrer's coherentism. Halbach asserts these discussed arguments are not conclusive. He does not claim that consistency actually is accessible in a relevant sense. Church's Theorem and G&ouml;del's Second Theorem makes it hard to assert a general account of how justification may be obtained, if consistency is to be used as a partial criterion for justification.<br /><br />2. Coherence and Personal Justification  section begins with Glenn Ross's: \\"Reasonable Acceptance and the Lottery Paradox: The Case for a More Credulous Consistency.\\" The skeptical and the inconsistency solutions to this paradox presuppose a principle of symmetry: that if I have equally good reason to accept of any ticket that it will lose as I have to accept that any other ticket will lose, I should adopt the same attitude uniformly. I should either accept of each ticket that it will lose or not accept of any ticket that it will lose. Lehrer accepts the principle of symmetry and argues that considerations of consistency show it is not reasonable to accept that any lottery ticket will lose. He then proceeds to show how he can get this result from his theory of rational acceptance. Lehrer analyzes personal justification in terms of coherence in an acceptance system. Whether a statement is reasonable to accept depends upon what statements compete with it.<br /><br />Ross proposes that we can slip through the horns by adopting a consistently credulous approach: one can rationally accept that one's ticket will lose, while not accepting that of many of the others, even though one is no less confident that they too will lose.<br /><br />There are good theoretical reasons to reject the Symmetry Principle. We accept in order to gain truth and avoid error. Basing acceptance on purely statistical grounds can be epistemically reasonable when the prospects for gain are great and the risks of loss small. A concomitant commitment to coherence provides the epistemological basis for our avoiding recognized inconsistency. Thus, Ross speak well of a position of credulous consistency as the most plausible of the three resolutions of the lottery paradox for reasonable acceptance. The lesson of the lottery is that we can sometimes have no better reason to accept, but reason enough.<br /><br />Charles B. Cross' \\"Relational Coherence and Cumulative Reasoning\\" begins by formalizing slightly simplified version of Lehrer's theory of relational coherence as a species of inductive reasoning. As an exercise in logic, the hypothesis that relational coherence is a species of inductive reasoning appears to be a success. Nothing could be more natural in the context of Lehrer's theory of knowledge than an account of inductive reasoning in terms of relational coherence.<br /><br />In \\"Lehrer Meets Ranking Theory\\" Wolfgang Spohn claims that ranking theory is the only existing theory suited for underpinning Keith Lehrer's account of knowledge and justification. However, the result of defining Lehrer's primitive notions in terms of ranking theory can disappoint. Justified acceptance has, depending on the interpretation, either an unintelligible structure or reduction to mere acceptance, and in the latter interpretation, knowledge will be reduced to true belief. Of course, this result requires a discussion of who would be disappointed.<br /><br />Carl G. Wagner's \\"Two Dogmas of Probabilism\\" rounds off section two, with a discussion of dogmatic restrictions on the representation of uncertain judgment, or on the way in which such judgment is revised, undermine the goal of faithfully representing the evidence regarding the state of the world.<br /><br />While Bayesian dogmatism has begun to yield to other principled methods of probability revision, the dogma of precision is still dominant in epistemic accounts. One source of resistance to working with non-additive upper and lower probabilities is the fear that such measures must necessarily be mathematically intractable. This greatly exaggerates the true state of affairs. There is a useful theory of upper and lower expectation, as well as a generalization of probability kinematics that provides new evidence. There is a theory of consensus for upper and lower probabilities that is remarkably similar to that in Lehrer and Wagner.<br /><br />3. Trustworthiness section begins with a contribution by James Van Cleve, \\"Lehrer, Reid, and the First of All Principles.\\"  Lehrer's groundbreaking work on the philosophy of Thomas Reid has revitalized Reid's philosophy. Cleve raises certain questions concerning Lehrer's interpretation of Reid's epistemology, especially with Lehrer's view that one among Reid's principles of common sense as a linchpin of an indispensably important metaprinciple.<br /><br />In \\"Self-Trust and the Reasonableness of Acceptance,\\" G. J. Mattey asserts that Lehrer's doctrine of reasonableness is based solely on acceptance, which leaves him open to a charge of broad circularity, a charge avoided by foundationalist accounts of reasonableness. It is only through a relation of mutual support that acceptances can make one another reasonable. Lehrer singles out a special acceptance, that I am trustworthy in what I accept, as playing a key role in providing that support. Mattey argues that acceptance of the principle makes the mere acceptance of a piece of information, including itself, reasonable to some extent, though in an entirely generic way. It does so in the context of the acceptance system as a whole.<br /><br />The principle of trustworthiness might also make itself reasonable by applying to itself directly, in which case it seems to be foundational and potentially to avoid the problem of broad circularity. But this direct application is narrowly circular and so holds no advantage in this respect over the indirect application. Because a direct application explains nothing that is not explained by the indirect approach, and indeed omits what ought to be included in any explanation of reasonableness, there is no reason to concede anything to the foundationalist. The essential ingredients in the explanation of reasonableness are to be found in the acceptance system as a whole, as is consonant with Lehrer's coherence approach to justification. The narrowly circular application of the principle of trustworthiness to itself is an aberration.<br /><br />Richard N. Manning in: \\"The Dialectic Illusion of a Vicious Bootstrap,\\" also finds self-trust problematic by thinking of a principle of general self-trust as not a member of one's acceptance system, but a kind of hand-stamper at the door, whose effect is to mark contents as accepted, thereby making them available in truth directed reasoning and justification. Self-trust, then, operates, not as a principle of detachment of an acceptance operator, but to distinguish which among those contents we canthink are to be exploited in epistemic inquiry. The way Lehrer conceives of self-trust-as a principle which is special, but special among acceptances to be exploited in bootstrapping-forces him to attempt give accounts of justification on two levels, the first subjective and doxastic, the second objective and veridical. The express purpose behind the objective accounts is in each case the avoidance of Gettier and Gettier related counterexamples. The lesson of Gettier and other cases may be that a certain kind of skepticism, the skepticism which claims that in any given case our justified empirical beliefs may fall short of knowledge, is unavoidable. The gap between personal, doxastic justification and veridical epistemic warrant will seem to need closing, by hook or by crook or by bootstrap, only if we fail to separate these two threats. And we will fail to separate them only if we think that the only way to ensure our grip on reality is through the identification of a justificatory procedure that will give us the ability to weed out the false from the true in our particular beliefs. The coherentist who feels the need for bootstraps shares at least that much with the foundational Cartesian: the urge for a principle the satisfaction of which by any given case of believing will show that belief to be true. Surely all the cooperation the world can provide will not make you knowledgeable if you lack the epistemic virtues embodied in the concept(s) of justification. And in this same way we can answer the question which motivated Lehrer's bootstrap in the first place, of how justification, in the light of these results, is epistemic at all. Justification is epistemic because of the intrinsically epistemic nature of what gets justified and does the justifying.<br /><br />4. Undefeated Justification and the Gettier Problem introduced in . Manning's essay is given a closer look by Hans Rott's \\"Lehrer's Dynamic Theory of Knowledge.\\" Rott uses the concepts and ideas borrowed from belief revision theory to elaborate Lehrer's dynamic theory of knowledge.

Rott refers to his worked out framework that characterizes the two fundamentally different perspectives on the process of belief revision. In the current theories of belief change, belief bases are not supposed to carry reductive connotations.

But at least one possible justification, a justification that the subject could use if asked, must be ableto survive the mentioned strong correction of the acceptance system. Then, and only then, is the true belief knowledge. In comparison with Lehrer-type proposals, this proposal for solving the Gettier problem has the advantage of involving just two belief systems, whereas the former have the advantage of using merely the concept of a justified belief (relative to a system of beliefs) and not the more demanding concept of (sufficient) reasons for a belief (relative to a system of beliefs).<br /><br />Rosenthal  offeres two proposals for solving the Gettier problem: first, the modified Lehrer proposal, and second, the one just mentioned. Rosenthal is not sure whether they are equivalent. But they could both be satisfactory solutions to the Gettier problem and yet not be equivalent, as long as they agree in all clear cases. There are borderline cases of belief in which one does not know whether to call the belief in question knowledge, because the intuitions are unclear or divided. No proposed criterion can be dismissed just because it decides a borderline case in this or that way. As long as it gets the clear cases right, it may count as a solution of the Gettier problem, and so there may be many nonequivalent solutions. But Rosenthal fears that sooner or later a clear example will come up for which the two proposals considered here fail, as was the fate of so many of their predecessors.<br /><br />5.

He, therefore, requires them as part of one's personal evaluation system and believes they carry through as truths to the ultrasystem. Knowledge requires this.

Further, we can coherently not accept the proposition (T) namely, I am trustworthy (worthy of my own trust) in what I accept with the objective of accepting something just in case it is true. However abstaining from accepting T does not necessarily lead to embracing academic skepticism. Such skeptics accept that T is false. The third alternative-the pyrrhonian alternative -is to withhold accepting T. That would bring with it withholding any proposition whose defense against objections depended upon accepting T.

J. Lawrence, Krystal Hemingway (Blackwell Science) The impact of pollution on fisheries and the potential health implications of eating contaminated fish are areas of considerable concern for the fishing and aquaculture communities, government bodies and the general public. Pollution, as well as over fishing, may well be contributory to recent serious declines in global fish stocks.<br /><br />Effects of Pollution on Fish brings together the work of many international experts each of whom have examined the literature on marine and freshwater fish and, where appropriate, invertebrates, to produce comprehensive chapters covering all major aspects of the impacts of pollution on fish and fisheries. The book describes these impacts in detail, from the molecular and sub-cellular level, through organism to population and community levels, and subsequently to socio-economic implications.<br /><br />The editors of this thorough and timely book have drawn together contributions encompassing molecular genetics, biochemistry, physiology, population and community biology, and fishery economics. As such, this important book will be of great use and interest to students and professionals studying and teaching in all those subject areas. Fish biologists, environmental scientists and ecotoxicologists, marine and freshwater ecologists, fisheries managers, aquaculture personnel and fish farmers, as well as fish veterinarians will all find much of great value within this book. Libraries in universities, and research establishments concerned with these areas should all have copies of this book on their shelves.<br /><br />The group of scientists involved in this book include individuals with expertise in each of the hierarchic levels of organisation on which pollution can impact. They encompass molecular geneticists, biochemists, physiologists, population and community biologists and fishery economics experts. Throughout the 2-year duration of the concerted action on which this volume is based, the group met on three occasions during which they worked on each of the thematic topics which form the basis to the chapters.<br /><br />Chapter 1 introduces the subject and context of the volume. It also presents a conceptual model which was developed following the first meeting of the group in Oslo, Norway. The model presented in this chapter is a simplified version of that presented in the report to the European Commission. The model describes the way in which pollution may impact on a fishery and highlights the potential linkages between the various biological levels of organisation from molecular to community and economic. It is used to identify the direct links<br /><br />The model additionally provides the framework around which the rest of the literature is presented in the book. Each of the following chapters were outlined at subsequent meetings of the group, first in Aveiro, Portugal, and later in Bilbao, Spain. The chapters represent linked technical themes which together describe the potential impact of pollution on a fishery. The chapters are designed both to describe the impact of pollution on the specific level of biological organisation and to highlight any linkages between this level and other, higher levels of complexity. The aim here was to confirm any pathways in which subcellular detection of pollution in the individual might lead to changes in population and community. A further important goal of the study was to identify and highlight any gaps in the literature that might help to direct future research in the field.<br /><br />Chapter 2 reviews the forms of genetic damage that occur within the cell, either as a direct result of pollution perturbation or due to the production of genotoxic by-products of the detoxification process. Forms of damage include those caused by oxygen radicals, and the formation of adducts and mutations, together with direct effects on chromosomes. The chapter links genetic damage to examples of the consequence of this at higher levels of organisation from tumour formation, cell death, lesions, production of neoplasms, altered enzyme function and protein turnover rates. In addition, protection mechanisms are identified. This chapter is seen to have clear links with many of the other chapters within the book.<br /><br />The links between molecular and cellular responses to pollution and the physiological response of individuals, including links to higher orders of organisation, are considered in Chapter 3. Principle components of this theme include the role of the lysosome and lysosome dysfunction related to altered rates of protein turnover and the energetic cost of altered gene expression. The chapter identifies links between these cellular events and organism effects including impacts on growth (including age/size trade-offs) and energy budget and scope for growth. Physiological effects examined included impacts on developmental processes such as osmoregulation, respiration and excretion, neuroendocrine and immune responses and impacts on reproduction.<br /><br />Chapter 4 examines aspects of the physical health and immune system of fish in relation to pollution exposure and the links between these responses and those seen at higher and lower levels of organisation. Aspects of macrohealth considered include parasite load, presence of lesions and papillomas, spine and other deformities, anaemia, fin rot and fungal infection. These are examined in relation to cellular and molecular damage and the causative agents. Disorders are classified into pathological, physiological and developmental.<br /><br />Chapter 5 considers one of the critical processes in the hierarchic chain of response through which impacts on the individual may be reflected in the population or natural homeostatic mechanisms override any pollution damage on the individual. Pollution impacts on reproduction and fecundity are linked directly to genetic damage in the gamete and impaired physiology through reallocation of energy. Additionally, the direct effects of endocrine disrupters on the reproductive process are considered. Evidence is reviewed on effects of pollutants on aspects of reproduction from egg size and viability to vitellogenic processes and fecundity.to pollution. Concepts of community structure together with functioning and effects of pollutants on these, through transfers of effects from cellular to individuals and then population and community, are considered in this chapter. The potential effects are analysed through the impacts on individual health in relation to condition and individual health in relation to production. Links between reproduction and population structure and survival to population yield are additionally reviewed. Production and yield are evaluated both in terms of quality and quantity of the population and quality of the individual.<br /><br />The implications to population genetics and fitness as a result of pollution exposure, genetic damage, and cellular and molecular events are reviewed in Chapter 7. The theme reviews microevolutionary processes including mutation, selection, genetic drift and inbreeding. Sublethal responses and the potential for selection are examined, including fitness effects such as viability and fecundity. The literature on existing polymorphisms in pollutant metabolising genes is reviewed, together with the molecular basis of adaptation and the evolution of tolerance. The consequences of these adaptations in terms of reduced genetic heterogeneity and future fitness are considered.<br /><br />Consequences of pollution impacts in relation to socio-economic effects are considered in Chapter 8. This incorporates the various bio-economic models currently employed b) fisheries scientists. These models give information on fish quality and population, both of which are impacted upon by the effects of pollution. An important elementof this chapter is not simply the impacts of pollution of fish and fish quality, but also the perceived impacts and the effects that this can have on individual fisheries and the overall resource. Direct links between lower order effects and impacts on the market are highlighted. Human health consequences are additionally considered.<br /><br />Finally, Chapter 9 summarises the evidence presented in each of the previous chapters with emphasis on the linkages identified between the hierarchic levels of biological organ. isation outlined in the conceptual model. The chapter highlights the areas in which recen advances have been made, as well as the aspects of the subject that require further study.

Always probing and speculative, Charles Burney has been a source of inspiration since the 1950s for archaeologists working in the highlands of east Anatolia, Trans-Caucasus and north-west Iran. Though this is a substantial volume of essays, written by pupils, friends and colleagues, the contributors are merely representatives of a much larger number who join us in honoring him.<br /><br />Charles managed, before the age of sophisticated gadgetry and the soul searching that accompanies much contemporary archaeology, to prepare solid foundations for future study and to point us all in the right direction. A breadth of vision accompanies his empirical approach in the field that is represented by pioneering surveys and excavations. Charles has always been adamant that sequences of sites or regions should not be merely parochial and his determination to set the highlands in the context of the wider Near East is reflected in the range of contributions in this volume.<br /><br />CHARLES BURNEY IN THE NEAR EASTERN HIGHLANDS<br /><br />Altan ÇILINGIROGLU<br /><br />Antonio SAGONA<br /><br />Mountains have always played a part in popular imagination. Their ruggedness and altitude foster a sense of danger and uncertainty. Beyond their peaks is fable and mystery. Often mountains are seen as borders and peripheries, promoting the idea of marginalisation and `the other'. At the same time, mountains occupy a central position in the ideology of those communities who live in their shadow, and who accord them individuality and often sacredness.<br /><br />In the history of archaeology of the Near East, the exploration of the highlands has lagged behind that of the lowlands. Initial interest in the Near East's antiquity was fuelled by an eagerness to unearth the ruins of civilisations mentioned in the Graeco-Roman and biblical historical traditions. Accordingly, discoveries at sites situated along the Mediterranean coast and in the Mesopotamian alluvium soon made the headlines of the popular press and further focussed attention on the lowlands. The monumentality and spectacular discoveries in Egypt also enhanced this riverine and coastal perspective of the past. This historical circumstance also suited a rather negative view of `mountain culture' prevalent in the nineteenth and early twentieth century that had endured since the time of Classical writers.' These populist images tended to picture lowland communities as innovators and the regions as more conducive for<br /><br />settlement, whereas mountain people were depicted as fiercely independent though dismissed as somehow culturally backward, living in remote regions and under inhospitable conditions. In the Near East, the highlands lacked their own `civilisation' and their exploration was not seen as a priority.<br /><br />In Anatolia, a mountainous landmass, the move beyond the western coastal plains, initially to the central plateau, came relatively early, where the homeland of the Hittites attracted attention, most especially the extensive site of Bogazk&ouml;y. But the most rugged highland regions to the east of the Euphrates, an archaeological wilderness, remained virtually unexplored. It was the material remains of the kingdom of Urartu that first caught the eye of early antiquarians. As early as the fifth century A. D., Moses of Khorene, in his narrative of Queen Semiramis, made reference to this ancient civilisation. But it was not until the French scholar, Friedrich Edward Schulz, carried out surveys of Van and its environs in 1827 that east Anatolia entered academic discussions, if only briefly. Although the untimely death of Schulz had interrupted investigations on Urartu, he should none the less be considered apioneer on the subject. The transportation of many findings obtained from the area of Van to museums in Europe - British Museum, Louvre and Berlin - increased scholarly interest in Urartu that led to the commencement of the first academic archaeological excavations at the end of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Many scholars have contributed to the development of Urartian archaeology. Hormuzd Rassam's excavations at Van, together with C. E Lehman-Haupt and W. W. Belck's excavations, in 1898, at Toprakkale were among the first. Likewise I. A. Orbelli, in 1911 and 1912, and Kirsop and Silva Lake, in 1938-39, played significant roles in publicising Urartu and its achievements. Shortly after, in the 1940s, Kiliç K&ouml;kten rode through the east Anatolian regions on horseback, noting some of the prehistoric heritage. He was quickly followed by another Turkish archaeologist trained as an ethnographer, Hamit Kosay, who excavated at Karaz, near Ezrurum, focusing attention on a distinctive culture noted for its red and black burnished pottery, often boldly ornamented.<br /><br />But this initial spurt of interest in the `mountain cultures' was short-lived and the archaeology of the highest altitudes in Anatolia once again languished until the 1950s and Charles A. Burney. Unaffected by the influential images of highland society and bristling with indefatigable energy, a young Charles tackled the Anatolian highlands, not on horseback, but on a bicycle, a feat that is justifiably considered one of those legendary accomplishments of Near Eastern archaeology. A scholar at the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara for 1954-55, Charles initiated a number of ground breaking reconnaissance, in swift succession, that soon changed our perception of ancient highlands. In 1954 and 1955 he surveyed northern Anatolia. The Annual Report of the British Institute for 1954 states:<br /><br />[Charles Burney] ...arrived in Turkey from Palestine in April 1954. He took part in the Beycesultan excavations after which he undertook a mound-survey covering an area approximating to the ancient province of Bithynia. Traveling mostly by bicycle, he made a thorough investigation, over a period of three months. The pottery notes and distribution maps prepared after his return to Ankara in the autumn should fill an important gap in our knowledge of northwestern Turkey.<br /><br />And the Annual Report for the following year, 1955, continues:<br /><br />[Charles Burney] ...spent the months of August-October in completing the mound survey of the northern provinces which he had begun in the previous summer. Mr Burney, who again traveled by bicycle (our emphasis), this year covered an area approximately corresponding to the ancient province of Pontus ...4<br /><br />Charles did indeed fill an important gap in the archaeology of northern Anatolia, but his attention would soon focus on the eastern highlands. There he recorded the key sites in the provinces of Sivas, Malatya, Adiyaman, Elazig, Mus, Bitlis, Van and Agri. (Map), paying particular attention to large mounds and Urartian sites. In four reports that remain fundamental to this day, Charles not only provided the first detailed and coherent account of the later prehistory of eastern Anatolia, he also published, with the assistance of G. R. J. Lawson, the first collection of plans and drawings of Urartian fortresses and towns located around Lake Van. This was the first systematic field research focused on Urartu. Years later, one of us (A. Ç.) with access to much improved equipment and facilities than were available to Charles, visited most of the castles around Van. It soon became clear that Charles had already visited all of them, except one, Ayanis. Though he later played down the impact of these surveys - \\"the [survey] was a preliminary reconnaissance without pretence of being definitive\\" - he had in fact opened up the archaeology of eastern Anatolia and had `empowered' the ancient highlanders by show casing their cultural achievements. Moreover, Charles' surveys and early publications on Urartu played a fundamental role in leading many scholars to work on Urartian history and art, and to conduct excavations in the area.<br /><br />After these surveys, Charles, now based at the University of Manchester, turned his hand to excavation and investigated the ancient mound of Yanik Tepe, near Tabriz, in north-west Iran, the first of four sites he has excavated.

Montgomery, School of Abbasid Studies (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 135: Peeters) The `Abbasids fascinate. Their fascination stems, in part, from their elusiveness, their chameleon-like ability to adapt and change, whether it be to suit the tempo of the times (and thereby prolong dynastic survival) or to steer the Islamic community in previously unwonted or uncustomary directions (and thereby to consolidate their hegemony). The `Abbasids represent an ever-shifting pattern of regnai identities, identities articulated through a complex matrix of negotiations and delegations of authority, of syncretistic and idiosyncratic ideologies, of malleable institutions, often very loosely constructed, and of a dazzling array of material and cultural splendours but rarely manifested in the civilized world.<br /><br />How do we begin to approach the study of a tradition which is liter-ate, and scriptorial (in addition to being scriptural too) as well as oral, and in which all three can be present at any one time, to varying degrees and in various combinations? Christopher Melchert and Joseph Lowry's articles bring out well the permutations to which so innocuous a phrase as qala 'l-Sh&auml;fi i (al-Sh&aacute;fi i said) can be liable, while Shawkat Toorawa highlights the major change in writerly practices which the Tenth Century heralded. The paradox here, of course, is that our only access to these fluid traditions is through the written word, i.e. through manuscripts. Nowadays, books are stable entities, finished products placed in the public domain with harsh penalties awaiting those who infringe upon the rights of the author conceived as intellectual owner of the book. It is almost a Pavlovian reflex to think of `Abbasid `books' as modern books, especially when printed editions exist, for they are books, are they not? Yet, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that authors revisited the same work on many occasions, that they allowed multiple and varying versions of a work to circulate, that they allowed students to record their words in a multiplicity of sessions, each of which was authoritative, in the sense that it stemmed from the author. In other words, and with the major exception of the Qur'an (quarrels over the text of which are so significant for the cultural notions they reveal in this regard), there is no notion of an `Ur-text' as it was conceived in mainstream philological scholarship of the Nineteenth Century and as it has persisted to our day. Even the Qur'an, the most stable text within Islam, is but a partial copy of the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahf&uuml;z), the divine prototype of an `Ur-text'. Not only do dangers of anticipation lie in treating these works as books, there are perils a-plenty in relying on the standard editions produced by our illustrious predecessors. De Goeje's edition of Ibn Khurrad&aacute;dhbih's Kit&aacute;b al-Mas&auml;zlik wa-l-Mam&aacute;lik (Leiden, 1889), for example, is a homogenized composite incorporating elements of the two versions which de Goeje himself identified as having been produced by the author. Elton Daniel's exposition of Houtsma's text of the history of al-Ya'q&uacute;bi and of the prejudices which an editor can bring to the mate-rial, and which any reader brings to a text, is of paramount importance.<br /><br />Our notion of the `book' is a cultural construct, one particular to our civilization. We should handle it with extreme caution, for it is, in the words of Michel Foucault, one of those phenomena `that encourage the consoling play of recognitions'.<br /><br />In several senses, this consideration arises out of the previous. Both terms derive from debates during the late 1960s surrounding the nature and potential of cognitive anthropology. Etic designates an approach to observable phenomena which is predicated upon the presumption, fundamental to logicalempiricism, of the objectivity of the observer and which is achieved through the recovery of particular instances of universal notions - in short (and to oversimplify), that what I understand by `virtue' will in a major or significant sense be tantamount to what an Athenian living in Plato's Athens would have understood by the term arete' or a Ninth Century intellectual living in Baghdad might mean when he uses the term muruwwa. The implications of this approach is very clearly, I think, exemplified by what I consider to be the problem of the political and the religious in `Abbasid society: when can a decision be described as political and when can it be deemed religious, if temporal (and by implication, political) power is localized in a religious institution like the Caliphate? What interests me most is not the partisan championing of a relativist over an objectivist hermeneutic, but rather what we stand to lose in the habituated application of a cultural commonplace from modem society to a society which could scarcely have entertained any such a notion.<br /><br />Standard political histories of whatever stamp will tend, for example, to interpret an action of a notable figure from the past as the consequence of a choice or a decision undertaken by that figure. Indeed, one could characterize this approach to history as the valorization of the concepts of choice and the autonomy of the individual. Modem Western societies tend to entertain what may be termed a `libertarian' notion of choice (i.e. the affirmation of freedom and the denial of determinism). For example, al-Ma'm&uuml;n could have chosen to stay in Mery to rule the Empire as Caliph or to return to Baghdad, a choice which he made in Jumada II, 202 (December, 817). But we should at least pause to consider whether, in a heavily determinist society in which action was taken in consultation with astrological predictions and in which the issue of divine Providence was never questioned or abandoned, al-Ma'm&uuml;n was free to choose otherwise than to return to Baghdad in Safar, 204 (August, 819), almost six years after the death of his brother al-Amin? Furthermore, did he have freedom in choice or freedom in action (which latter he exercised for six years by not returning)?' After all, the point at issue in the theological controversies concerning al-qadar wa-'l-qad&aacute;' is not the issue of free will as opposed to predetermination but rather the location of human responsibility within a providential universe governed by Allah's omniscient foreknowledge of events. The complexities of choice, for example, as a notion which we think we recognize but the nuances of which we eliminate through anticipation and recognition are nicely brought out in Peter Adamson's article on al-Kindi. Surely choice in a providential religion and astrological culture is an issue of burning importance for `Abbasid historiography? Indeed, are we to think that `choice' for a Hanafi or a Mu'tazili was the same process as that for a Hanbali, or an Ash`ari?<br /><br />I am repeatedly struck by how traditional, in terms of our methods, our disciplines are. The history versus historiography debate, for example, has alerted us to the presence of topoi, to the use of rhetorical devices in the creation of narrative and to the relevance of the forms in which content is expressed, but we persist in our belief that through careful and informed sifting of the evidence, like detectives in a murder case with only circumstantial evidence to rely on, we can still work out and decide what `really' happened. Again, I do not mean to fly in the face of standard practice, but we ought to cultivate the realization that the texts with which we struggle are anything but translucent or unsullied. Indeed, I find them to be recalcitrant, evasive, and often consciously impenetrable. In this respect, our disciplines lag far behind say recent developments in the Classics or Medieval English. In our fields, when a theory oran approach is chosen, it often acts as an ideological mincer through which everything is forced.<br /><br />In my capacity as editor of this volume, I have imposed the following divisions on the contributions, grouping them under the rubrics of Institutions and Concepts, Figures, and Archaeology of a Discipline. These divisions are, of course, entirely artificial, and do not correspond with the programme which we devised for the Conference. To be sure, my inclusion of some of the papers under a given category may at times seem quixotic. The considerable overflow between and interdependence of these categories reflect, in a manner which I find to be representative, the character of `Abbasid society which was, in keeping with many other pre-modem societies, at best but semi-institutionalised. Such institutions as existed were constantly changing, adapting and evolving. Many enjoyed an astonishing longevity. It may thus surprise some readers that I have included Julia Bray's paper on al-Tanikhi and Mu'tazilism under the rubric of Institutions and Concepts, though, as she brings out very well, Mu'tazilism could not only take the form of an inflection in a thinker's view of the world, it could also be a family tradition encapsulating long-cherished beliefs and as such attain to the status of an unofficial rather than a formal institution. Paul Heck's analysis of Ibn al-Muqaffa', al-Mawardi and Qudama b. Ja`far would fit easily in the context of the chronologically arranged section on Figures, were it not for his concentration on their presentation of the role of the ruler as the representative of the law. Equally, I was tempted to make a case for the inclusion of Herbert Berg's study of Ibn `Abbas under Institutions, for he understands the figure of Ibn `Abbas to be tantamount to an institution of `Abbasid polemical self-justification, evoked to legitimize their right to rule, and as such more than a figure-head and perhaps rather what one literary critic (it may have been T.S. Eliot) described as a zone of consciousness.<br /><br />Figures and institutions exist in a symbiotic relationship, for it is individuals who articulate, actualize and amend the institutions, while the institutions are designed in the first place to determine how individuals participate in society. One of the ways in which individuals interact with institutions is through the construction and maintenance of disciplines - without lawyers, for example, there would be no law. Disciplines would not exist were it not for figures to realize them, and so the figure of al-Shafi i looms large in the contributions by Christopher Melchert and Joseph Lowry, while Devin Stewart's bold excavations of the formal beginnings of Islamic jurisprudence provide a veritable portrait-gallery of early jurisprudents.t, 819), almost six years after the death of his brother al-Amin?

Written in a style accessible to undergraduates as well as specialists, McDermott's book makes an eloquent case for the importance of psychology to our under-standing of global politics.<br /><br />In the wake of September 11, the American public has been besieged with claims that politics is driven by personality. Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Kim Chong-Il, Ayatollah Khameinei-America's political rogues' gallery is populated by individuals whose need for recognition supposedly drives their actions on the world stage. How does personality actually drive politics? And how is personality, in turn, formed by political environment? Political Psychology in International Relations provides students and scholars with the analytical tools they need to answer these pressing questions, and to assess their implications for policy in a real and sometimes dangerous world.<br /><br />\\"This is a real tour de force. McDermott is a master of the diverse approaches to political psychology and international politics. Newcomers to the subject cannot find a better guide; skeptics, even if not persuaded, will be enlightened; even experts will see the field in a new way.\\" -Robert Jervis, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY<br /><br />\\"Realizing that terrorism incites fear for political objectives brings to the fore the new dynamisms operating between psychology and political science. Rose McDermott's extraordinary work breathes new life into political psychology, providing a comprehensive and accessible account of the discipline's fundamental principles and methods.\\" -Philip G. Zimbardo, STANFORD UNIVERSITY<br /><br />Rose McDermott is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a renowned expert on the connections between international politics and psychology.<br /><br />Excerpt: The events of September 11 profoundly shook the sense of personal security previously experienced by most Americans. In the light of the terrorist attacks, many of the questions and concerns that circulated in the media and in private conversations focused on the motivations of those involved. Why would someone do something so horrible? How might a leader induce his followers to give their lives for an abstract cause, and accomplish such a seemingly impossible goal even from a long distance away? How could people hate America and Americans so much when we mostly believe that we are decent and fair people who are concerned with the individual and human rights of others? How can a relatively small series of rare events puncture the sense of personal security of so many individuals not directly affected by the events? How can the government warn people to be careful without inducing fear and paralysis? How can individuals within a nation constructively channel bottomless degrees of anger, anguish, and abhorrence? Any one of these questions, along with many others, requires and deserves tremendous thought and consideration.<br /><br />Two main insights come out of this reflection. First, explanations for very important and influential events often lie in the personal psychology of leaders, participants, victims, and observers. Comprehensive explanations for the personal motivations of a suicide bomber cannot be complete without some understanding of the nature of individual thought, action, and emotion. Second, tragedy can shift values, beliefs, and behaviors. Most important, tragedy can bring people together in previously unexpected and unusual ways. And psychological comfort, social support, and resistance to isolation achieve whatno terrorist can dissolve: resilient individuals, community commitment, and political cohesion. These outcomes do not justify or ameliorate the impact of tragedy, but they do illuminate the ubiquitous nature of psycho-logical phenomena within the context of the political world. Accurate representations of the world around us demonstrate the link between politics and psychology in deep and myriad ways.<br /><br />Every year, a topic appears in the news that offers direct evidence of this interplay. One year the Monica Lewinsky scandal suggested the ways in which a bright and promising politician can fall victim to his own personal psychological weaknesses. Another year the Chinese shot down an American spy plane and held the crew hostage for a period of time during which crucial questions about the decision-making capacity of the new president were raised. And all of these events seem silly or trivial in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 2001. Those events left many feeling frightened, hopeless, and powerless.<br /><br />One of the best ways to handle a personal sense of impotence lies in action, particularly action designed to help others or to gain some sense of mastery over the source of the fear by trying to obtain a better understanding of its sources. Methodological and theoretical tools exist to illuminate the processes that go into creating terrorists, encouraging followers to obey leaders, developing ideologies, and channeling emotion. This book attempts to examine these tools and the insights they produce through the prism of political psychology.<br /><br />What is political psychology? Why it is important? If the field of political psychology is to be more than the sum of its parts, it must add value to the independent studies of political science and psychology. In fact, there are many important issues and questions where each discipline benefits from the contributions and insights of the other. There are myriad ways in which political science and psychology interconnect. Combining these disciplines can provide additional purchase in topics that include the study of political leadership, political judgment and decision making, public opinion and voting behavior, the impact of emotion on behavior, the interaction between individual processes and group behavior, and the formation and maintenance of dominant values in society.<br /><br />This book provides an introductory survey to the study of political psychology in international relations. The study of political psychology has produced a wide literature in American politics, particularly in American political behavior, as well. However, this book focuses on the application of social and cognitive psychology to the study of security issues in international relations.'<br /><br />In many instances, psychologists have focused on theory development while political scientists have emphasized theory application. Similarly, much scholarship has focused on the impact of psychology on politics and paid less attention to the impact of politics on psychology. Yet the relation-ship between these areas should be reciprocal. The goal is to pro-vide a genuinely interdisciplinary approach to the interaction of psychological processes and political outcomes.<br /><br />This book provides an overview of the relevant methods and theories that have been used in the examination of political psychology in international relations in chapters 2 and 3. Explanation concentrates on the particular strengths and weaknesses of these concepts for specific purposes. The impact of people's thoughts, actions, and emotions on political judgment, decision making, and behavior are discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6. Finally, the roles of psychobiography, leadership, and groups are analyzed in chapters 7, 8, and 9. Chapter 10 provides a summary of potential extensions and notable implications of these findings. The purpose of this approach is to offer a critical overview of the major literature and central issues and questions in the field, as well as to offer suggestions for promising directions in future research.<br /><br />What unifies political psychology and makes it distinct from other forms of political analysis is the search for explanation, description, and prediction at the individual level of analysis. The individual level of analysis informs and affects the kinds of questions that are asked, the forms of evidence that are sought, and the natures of inferences about causality that are made by political psychologists. This attentional bias is not always limited to the individual, for sometimes it incorporates the individual acting in concert with other individuals in group settings, but nonetheless it privileges the individual over organizational, bureaucratic, domestic institutional, economic, international, or other levels of analysis that diminish the significance of the individual.

The study of political psychology has produced a wide literature in American politics, particularly in American political behavior, as well. However, this book focuses on the application of social and cognitive psychology to the study of security issues in international relations.' <br />In many instances, psychologists have focused on theory development while political scientists have emphasized theory application. Similarly, much scholarship has focused on the impact of psychology on politics and paid less attention to the impact of politics on psychology. Yet the relation-ship between these areas should be reciprocal. The goal is to pro-vide a genuinely interdisciplinary approach to the interaction of psychological processes and political outcomes. <br />This book provides an overview of the relevant methods and theories that have been used in the examination of political psychology in international relations in chapters 2 and 3. Explanation concentrates on the particular strengths and weaknesses of these concepts for specific purposes. The impact of people's thoughts, actions, and emotions on political judgment, decision making, and behavior are discussed in chapters 4, 5, and 6. Finally, the roles of psychobiography, leadership, and groups are analyzed in chapters 7, 8, and 9. Chapter 10 provides a summary of potential extensions and notable implications of these findings. The purpose of this approach is to offer a critical overview of the major literature and central issues and questions in the field, as well as tooffer suggestions for promising directions in future research. <br />What unifies political psychology and makes it distinct from other forms of political analysis is the search for explanation, description, and prediction at the individual level of analysis. The individual level of analysis informs and affects the kinds of questions that are asked, the forms of evidence that are sought, and the natures of inferences about causality that are made by political psychologists. This attentional bias is not always limited to the individual, for sometimes it incorporates the individual acting in concert with other individuals in group settings, but nonetheless it privileges the individual over organizational, bureaucratic, domestic institutional, economic, international, or other levels of analysis that diminish the significance of the individual. In this regard, political psychology provides a particularly humanistic slant on politics by asserting the importance of individual psychological processes to political outcomes. <br />This chapter offers a background for the specific findings discussed later. Historical context provides a foundation for the emergence of the defining characteristics and central issues and questions that have preoccupied inquiry in this field. Resolutions and new research agendas that have emerged from this scholarship pose challenges for researchers who wish to understand the inter-section of psychological and political processes.	2004-09-09

Philanthropy in America-the first comprehensive treatment of the topic-examines America's remarkable history of charitable action from the early 1600s to the present day. The work was developed under the guidance of Dr. Dwight Burlingame, the nation's foremost expert on philanthropy, and represents a milestone in the study of philanthropy and nonprofit organizations in America.<br /><br />This all-encompassing resource:<br /><br />Is the first and only encyclopedia on the topic as a whole<br /><br />Includes over 200 A-Z entries on individuals, organizations, events, theories, and legislation, with reference to works for further study<br /><br />Features contributions from nearly 200 leading scholars from a wide variety of disciplines<br /><br />Offers over 75 essential primary source documents, such as the Poor Laws of 1601 and the Filer Commission Report of 1975<br /><br />Presents a philanthropic timeline, from the 1601 enactment of the Statute of Charitable Uses to the 1999 establishment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation<br /><br />Provides a deeper understanding and perspective of the role of philanthropy in the United States<br /><br />This groundbreaking, illustrated work fills the long-felt need for a comprehensive encyclopedia on philanthropy in America. In accessible fashion, it introduces the reader to information and<br /><br />ideas central to the study of philanthropy, making it a paramount resource for students, scholars, and anyone seeking a broad understanding of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector in the United States.<br /><br />Dwight F. Burlingame is professor of philanthropic studies and director of academic programs at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN. He is the author and editor of several works in the field of corporate citizenship, philanthropy, nonprofit organizations, and libraries.<br /><br />Excerpt: Philanthropic and nonprofit studies have enjoyed a major growth spurt over the past twenty-five years in the United States, with recent increased attention around the globe. However, some still see the field as a marginal academic enterprise. With substantial contributions by many scholars in various disciplines and professional fields, philanthropic and nonprofit studies programs have given students and teachers alike a fresh perspective on critical issues in our society. Philanthropic studies instructors relate their material to broader cultural, historical, political, and economic themes. This integrative perspective is a defining element that encourages analytic skill and develops an intellectual, global view that emphasizes the complexity and thematic relationships of a civil society. The authors of the articles in this encyclopedia have made this objective central to their work in contributing to a liberal education.<br /><br />In the mid-1990s, I had several conversations with my colleagues at Indiana University about the need foran encyclopedia of philanthropy. Those conversations usually ended with the conclusion that it would be an impossible task to get one's arms and mind around such a broad field. It wasn't until my friend and colleague in philanthropic studies at Indiana, David Smith, provided the sage advice that I should undertake this task as an opportunity to make a \\"significant\\" contribution to the field, that I decided to pursue the project. With support and encouragement from colleagues at the Center on Philanthropy and a former editor from ABC-CLIO, a contract was signed and work commenced.<br /><br />Deciding what to include in this three-volume set was not an easy task, as philanthropic studies is a very broad field. To select the entries, I worked with an advisory committee composed of scholars, nonprofit practitioners, and educators.Final determination for what was included, however, was my responsibility. Volumes 1 and 2 include articles on notable people, events, and associations as well as on numerous other important topics in philanthropy. Volume 3 brings together original documents in the field.<br /><br />More than 175 authors participated in the project. For the most part, the essays were written by well-known specialists in their chosen topical area. In a few cases, bright graduate students from the philanthropic studies or nonprofit management programs at Indiana University, Indianapolis, wrote entries.<br /><br />Needless to say, thousands of significant individuals have contributed and are currently contributing to the history of giving, volunteering, and social action in the United States. Therefore, my inclusion of a historical figure is very selective and has been made on the basis of a representative type of those who have shaped the history of philanthropy, that is, the history of voluntary action (giving of time, treasure, and talent) intended for the public good. I was greatly assisted in this selection matter by a previous project, Notable American Philanthropists: Biographies of Giving and Volunteering (2002), which was directed by Robert T. Grimm Jr. and made possible by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. Users may find more extensive philanthropic biographies of many of the people covered in this encyclopedia by consulting that work.<br /><br />Organizations selected for inclusion are those most directly related to the philanthropic infrastructure of the field and its development over time.

Again, it is important to note that this needed to be a selective representation, and the final decision of what to include was dictated by availability of material and subjective judgment.

Taking this perspective, American history reads like an ongoing tension play between morals and money, or between obligations to others and those to self.

US	52886341	R3DM2ZEN74F5LZ	0826468209	399070940	Language and Reality: Selected Writings of Sydney Lamb (Open Linguistics)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Linguistics Uncommon Sense	Language and Reality by Sydney Lamb, edited by Jonathan Webster (Open Linguistics: Continuum International Publishing Group) presents selected writings of Sydney Lamb, including five new works and several which have been re-worked for publication here. Professor Lamb's work in linguistics over the past four decades has been concerned with exposing illusions about language and with finding realities, including neurological realities, behind the linguistic abstractions that others have dwelt upon. His name is synonymous with certain landmarks in the development of linguistic theory, including stratificational grammar, relational network theory and more recently, neurocognitive linguistics. Although he is a leading figure in linguistic science, many of the papers included here are far from well-known, some of them having appeared in more obscure venues of publication and for the most part, unavailable to the wider linguistic community.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, the first of which includes papers offering insight into the man behind this pioneering approach to linguistics that might best be summed up as 'linguistics to the beat of a different drummer'. The papers in Part II explore the theoretical origins of Lamb's ideas about language that have often been described as ahead of their time. Part III includes more recent writings outlining work done in neurocognitive linguistics. Studies of the interconnectedness of language with other kinds of human experience and with history are presented in Part IV.<br /><br />Sydney Lamb is Arnold Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at Rice University in Texas. Jonathan Webster is Acting Head of the Department of Chinese, Translation and Linguistics, and Associate Dean in the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the City University of Hong Kong.<br /><br />From the Editor's Introduction: Professor Sydney Lamb acknowledges he is probably best known for \\"the collection of ideas connected with the term Stratificational Grammar\\" (Chapter 2). In fact, his contribution to linguistics as a discipline goes beyond the recognition of strata or layers in human linguistic structure to the realization that the whole of linguistic structure is a network of relationships - a realization with implications for our understanding of \\"the wider class of phenomena of which `natural spoken language' is just one type\\" (Chapter 5). The linguistic system, like other cognitive systems, is a composite of thousands of nections (\\"hundreds of thousands if we include conceptual structure\\"), which are \\"interconnected in multiple layers\\" (Chapter 25).<br /><br />Lamb began down the path toward this realization over four decades ago. As expressed by the title for Part One, it has been - to borrow a line from Robert Frost - \\"the road less traveled by.\\" Equally apt is the next line from the same poem: \\"And that has made all the difference.\\" Lamb's realization that \\"this puzzling, beautiful and complex human information system\\" is best described as a network of relationships rather than a system of symbols, rules, and entries, has made him \\"better equipped to understand what the real world is really like\\" (Chapter 1). Therein lies the difference between Sydney Lamb and many of his contemporaries. Lamb regards language as a semiotic to be studied for what it reveals about the workings of the mind. Taking Hjemslev's view, language is not an isolated phenomenon, instead it is at the very center of all science. So when, in the first chapter, \\"On the Aims of Linguistics\\" (1981), Lamb asks \\"what linguistics is and where it is going, or where it ought to be going, and what it is good for,\\" it is not surprising that he answers by affirming Linguistics as a discipline \\"sans frontiers.\\" Not only does he question \\"if there is any part of social science to which linguistics cannot contribute,\\" but also in terms of the relationship between linguistics and the humanities, he argues that<br /><br/>\\"boundaries no longer exist to separate linguistics from poetics, rhetoric, and the study of literature in general.\\"<br /><br />Also in this first part, the auto-biographical \\"Linguistics to the Beat of a Different Drummer\\" (1998) and \\"Mary R. Haas: Lessons in and out of the Classroom\\" (1998) recall the early influences on Lamb's ideas about language and reality, including most notably Louis Hjemslev's Prolgomena to a Theory of Language, M.A.K. Halliday's network notation, and Mary Haas' course in Phonetics and Phonemics. Chapter Four, \\"Translation and the Structure of Language\\" (2001) looks back at his experience in machine translation some four decades before, when he was leading the Berkeley MT Project team's effort to develop a system for translating Russian biochemistry texts into English. Taking the use of pointers in programming to the next level, recognizing that \\"a system in which all structurally relevant information is interconnected by means of pointers is equivalent to a network,\\" Lamb was closing in on the theoretically significant observation that \\"if all the information pertaining to a morpheme (likewise any linguistic unit) is accounted for by network connections to all of the components of that information, then the symbol that was being used to represent that morpheme becomes redundant - it can be erased with no loss of information. Where that symbol was, before being erased, there is just one point of the network, connecting to all of that information ... And so the symbol turns out to be superfluous, not part of the structure at all.\\" Lamb had succeeded in demonstrating Hjemslev's point \\"that a linguistic system is made up purely of relationships and that what seem to be linguistic objects are really nothing but points in a system of relationships.\\"<br /><br />Part Two, under the heading \\"The Structure of Language\\", includes seven papers, the first of which, \\"Epilegomena to a Theory of Language\\" (1966), introduces readers to \\"one of the classics of twentieth-century linguistics,\\" Hjemslev's Prolegomena. Chapter 6, \\"Lexicology and Semantics\\" (1969), deals with the lexicological and semantic structure of language, in particular, sememic syntax, sememic components, polysemy, and lexemic components. Chapter 7, \\"Some Types of Ordering\\" (1972), argues that rules of the usual kind (\\"rewrite rules\\") produce much needless complication that gets in the way of understanding linguistic structure. The next chapter, \\"Language as a Network of Relationships\\" (1974), which originally appeared in Herman Parret's Discussing Language, is uniquely presented in Q&A style, with Lamb responding to questions posed by Parret.<br /><br />A decade separates the next two chapters, \\"Mutations and Relations\\" (1975) and \\"Descriptive Process\\" (1985). \\"Mutations and Relations\\", presented at the First LACUS Forum (1974), argues against the process metaphor in linguistics, not just because it is unrealistic, but, more importantly, because \\"it has rather extensive unfortunate consequences for the overall view of linguistic structure of those who adhere to it, as well as for their ability to describe and explain the actual, real linguistic processes, particularly processes of speaking and understanding and those of linguistic change.\\" \\"Descriptive Process\\" revisits the same topic on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of LACUS at the Eleventh LACUS Forum (1984). Acknowledging what seems to be our natural bent toward the process metaphor, Lamb nevertheless urges linguists to \\"look beyond the subterfuge\\" brought about by the very same properties of language that contribute to its flexibility and transparency. Lamb rejects descriptive processes as fictitious, and instead focuses attention on the very real processes of speaking, understanding, and learning.<br /><br />The final chapter of this part, \\"Using Language and Knowing How\\" (1988), is from the second of two formal discussions to take place at The Claremont Graduate School between Sydney Lamb and M.A.K. Halliday - the first discussion having occurred sixteen years earlier. This chapter also follows some twenty years on from when the first chapter in this part, \\"Epilegomena to a Theory of Language\\", first appeared. The notion of nection as the basic organizing unit of linguistic structure begins to figure more prominently in Lamb's writing as his theory moves beyond the uniformly layered, neat system of early stratification grammar to the realization of the rich complexity of language as a cognitive system.<br /><br />Part Three, \\"Neurocognitive Linguistics\\", represents some of Lamb's more recent work, and also includes several new works. Lamb's relational network theory is shown to be both linguistically grounded and neurologically plausible. Leading off in Chapter 12, \\"Language as a Real Biological System\\", which is comprised of excerpts from a paper previously published under the title \\"Bidirectional Processing in Language and Related Cognitive Systems\\" (2000), Lamb makes clear that the notion of relational network was arrived at on the basis of linguistic, not neurological evidence. The chapters in this part describe areas in which Lamb has attempted to apply the ideas of neurocognitive linguistics. These include studies of language development, the interplay between language and thought, discourse interpretation, second language<br /><br />learning of syntax, and speech perception. Chapter 17, \\"Questions of Evidence in Neurocognitive Linguistics\\", presents both linguistic and neurological evidence \\"for the hypothesis that the neurocognitive basis of a person's linguistic system is a relational network.\\" By providing a plausible neurological basis for his theory, Lamb has accomplished the integration of linguistics with the rest of science.<br /><br />If \\"linguistics is what linguists do,\\" then Lamb's studies of \\"Language in the Real World\\" - the title of Part Four - have played a defining role in establishing the theoretical foundations for a more realistic linguistics. The papers in this section span four decades and cover studies of languages across time and space; language and music; and language in relation to animal communication systems, and other human information systems.<br /><br />Lamb makes no distinction between linguistic information and non-linguistic information; all information is stored and processed the same way, as connections in a vast network. Information processing consists of (a) the transmission of activation along pathways defined by the network and (b) changes in connection strengths. These mental networks (made up of nections) form the basis for our representation of reality: \\"We human beings, as we go through life, are engaged in a continuing process of building nections and interconnecting them, and of attempting to influence our fellow creatures in their nection-building\\" (Chapter 24).<br /><br />In the concluding chapter of this volume, \\"Philosophical Differences and Cognitive Styles\\" (2001), Sydney Lamb suggests our respective views on \\"language\\" may come down to something more basic than the reasoning process, \\"something so basic that it leads one to favor certain views and beliefs over others, even certain reasoning processes over others.\\" This something is cognitive style. Diversity in cognitive style may be accounted for in part by which portion of the brain one favors for mental activity. We think differently because we use our brains differently. How we respond to this diversity will decide if it enriches or impoverishes the human experience. What is important is that we each march in the linguistics parade not to the beats of more readily audible drums, but rather as Sydney Lamb has done, to the beat of a different drummer, oneself. At the same time, the more we respect each other's cognitive styles, the more we will learn about ourselves.guistics,\\" Hjemslev's Prolegomena.

US	52886341	R1ERTYEQKBQ66Y	0826471986	797169096	The Aesthetic in Kant (Continuum Studies in Philosophy)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Removing Beauty from Reason	Aesthetic in Kant by James Kirwan (Continuum International Publishing Group) Kant's Critique of the Power of Judgment is widely held to be the seminal work of modern aesthetics. In recent years it has been the focus of intense interest and debate not only in philosophy but also in literary theory and all disciplines concerned with the aesthetic.<br /><br />The Aesthetic in Kant is a new reading of Kant's problematic text. It draws upon the great volume of recent philosophical work on this classic text and on the context of eighteenth-century aesthetics. Kant's work is used as a basis on which to construct a radical alternative to the antinomy of taste - the basic problem of the aesthetic. In Kant's account is a theory of the aesthetic that, far from establishing its `disinterested' nature, instead makes it symptomatic of what Kant himself describes as the ineradicable human tendency to entertain `fantastic desires'.<br /><br />James Kirwan is Associate Professor in the Department of Anglo-American Studies at Kobe University of Foreign Studies, Japan, and author of Literature, Rhetoric, Metaphysics (Routledge, 1990), Beauty (Manchester University Press, 1999), and Sublimity (Routledge, 2004).<br /><br />The closing decades of the twentieth century saw the publication of several excellent full-length commentaries and a wealth of articles on `Kantian aesthetics'. Even now, it is a rare event for an issue of any of the major journals of aesthetics to appear without an article that concerns itself with one of the topics to be touched on hereafter. At the time of writing there is (for better or worse) no more scrutinized or controversial text in aesthetics than the Critique of the Power of Judgment. Despite this attention, however, there still remain a great many open questions, not merely regarding the interpretation of specific points in that text but also regarding its overall consistency, and ultimate significance for modem aesthetics. Such is the complexity (or, as some commentators would have it, confusion) of Kant's text, that any assertion about it - even one that pretends to be no more than descriptive - can only be made in the face of a contrary preexisting interpretation. Ideally this work would have begun with the present Chapter 5, or even 6, that is, with some agreed interpretation of what Kant was attempting, and what he had achieved, and confined itself exclusively to the necessary critical reconstruction that would highlight those fruitful discords which are my main subject. However, as the intense scholarly interest which Kant's text has aroused in the last few decades<br /><br />amply attests, an uncontroversial thumbnail sketch of Kant's aesthetics is, at present, quite simply impossible.<br /><br />Therefore, although Kirwan's main interest in Kant's text does not often overlap with the central concerns of the existing secondary literature - epistemology, ethics, the nature of art, the consistency of Kant's critical project as a whole, the rise of the bourgeoisie, a potential political role for `judgment' - it is, nevertheless, necessary that the present work acknowledge the diversity of interpretation to be found in this literature by making explicit the understanding of Kant's text upon which it is based. Though Kirwan's purpose here is to make sense of taste, to find an alternative solution to Kant's antinomies, the solutions to several currently contentious questions in the interpretation of Kant's text are here advanced as useful to those whose attention to the text is motivated by other interests.<br /><br />From the point of view of the existing literature, however, there is one large omission from Kirwan's work that must be noted. That epistemological and ethical concerns have dominated the recent resurgence of interest in Kant's third Critique would seem to follow naturally from the fact that Kant himself proposes that the `key' to the problem of taste lies in the realm of the epistemological, in the `harmony of the faculties'. It was, indeed, Kant's avowed intention that the Critique of the Power of Judgment should be a completion of his critical project as a whole. It is not, of course, the case that all recent commentators on Kant have accepted that the third Critique does represent the `bridge' between reason and understanding that Kant intended it to be, nor is there general agreement that the `riddle of taste', as Kant presents it to us, must ineluctably lead to a conclusion in these terms. Yet all recent commentators have largely given over their commentaries to an elucidation of what sense Kant's solution to the riddle of taste can be made to bear in Kant's own terms. Insofar as Kirwan  does not believe that Kant's exposition does lead ineluctably to the kind of solution he provides, nor, indeed, to the necessity for the introduction of any kind of epistemological account, a rehearsal of the relationship of the third Critique to the critical project as a whole would have been strictly redundant.<br /><br />The present work, then, in contrast to a great deal of the existing secondary literature, concentrates exclusively on the problem of taste. To this end, Kirwan steers as straight a course as possible through Kant's exposition to what he takes to be his final thesis, in order to proceed from there (albeit by regression) to Kirwan's own critique. The scope of the present work, then, is much narrower that that of the Critique of the Power Judgment itself,  For example,  Kirwan largely ignors what Kant says about the social role of judgments of taste, and the genesis of art. This study is concerned almost exclusively with the phenomenology of taste that Kant presents, and, more specifically, with drawing out the implications of that phenomenology in order to show why Kirwan believes that Kant was premature in his verdict on the inscrutability of taste.<br /><br />Chapters 1 and 2 sets out the nature of the judgment of taste as it is described in the Critique of the Power of Judgment, and seeks to establish that the indispensable condition of a judgment of taste is that it represents the subject's feeling of immediate delight in the object so designated. Because of this apparent autonomy, the object of taste appears to the subject to be an object of necessary delight, though reflection on the differences that do, as a matter of fact, exist in taste, should inform that subject that the object, paradoxically enough, is only an object of `necessary' delight for them. Kant's analysis, Kirwan argues, does not lead to a definition of `judgment of taste' as a judgment on an object of necessary delight, but rather as a judgment on what is cognized by the subject as an object of necessary delight. Chapter 2 deals particularly with Kant's contentious distinction between free and dependent, or adherent, beauty, and argues that the distinction can be shown to turn on the extent to which we are conscious that a concept has been active in the process of cognizing the object which is the object of our judgment of taste; so that the ultimate touchstone of whether a judgment of taste is a judgment on a free or a dependent beauty is the subject's feeling of whether it is the one or the other. Dependent beauty (pulchritude adhaerens), it is suggested, is best identified with judgments on aesthetic merits (in the modern rather than Kantian sense) other than beauty itself. Chapter 2 also proposes that the kind of concept one discerns in dependent beauty takes the form of what Kant calls an aesthetic idea: `that representation of the imagination that occasions much thinking though without it being possible for any determinate thought, i.e., concept, to be adequate to it, which, consequently, no language fully attains or can make intelligible'.<br /><br />Having dealt in Chapters 1 and 2 with the question of what judgments of taste are, Chapter 3 turns to Kant's explanation of their grounds. This chapter deals with Kant's notoriously unsatisfactory proposition that the determining ground of taste lies in the supersensible substrate of humanity in general, in the subjective finality of nature for the power of judgment. It argues that it is possible to provide an alternative grounding for the phenomenon that is Kant's starting point, and, moreover, that this grounding is immanent in Kant's own account We gain some hint of its possibility from the specific examples of taste that Kant gives, though it is only in the ostensibly 'supplementary' critique of the sublime that these hints are more fully developed. For it is specifically in dealing with the sublime that Kant's account shows how the conceptual may be introduced into taste without compromising its apparent autonomy. Though Kant denies that judgments on the sublime are judgments of taste at all, it is Kirwan's contention in Chapter 4 that Kant's own account shows otherwise and that, consequently, Kant's analysis of the grounds of the sublime is, in effect, the analysis of a particular form of dependent beauty. An examination of the structure of the aesthetic idea involved in this form of judgment of taste may then carry us beyond that, in effect, ineffable grounding of taste which Kant provides.<br /><br />Chapters 5 and 6 propose that the form of the idea discerned in the sublime does, indeed, conform to Kant's description of the aesthetic idea: it is not identifiable with an idea which can be cognized by the subject as grounded in either logic, or desire, it accounts for the subject's discernment of the object as an object of `disinterested' pleasure, and it is ultimately unintelligible to that subject: the subject may feel that the idea somehow justifies the judgment but is unable to show how it does so. Most importantly, the form which the idea takes will also account for how the aesthetic idea can be entertained as inextricable from the pleasure, while yet that pleasure also appears to be a pleasure `in' the object, rather than in the idea itself<br /><br />Chapters 7 and 8 offer two further examples of judgments of taste, on dependent and free beauty respectively, taken from the text, showing the constitutive role of the aesthetic idea in each case, and accounting for the original distinction between these forms of judgment in terms of their different grounding. The first example is one that Kant himself brings forward to illustrate the notion of the aesthetic idea; the second is an instance of free beauty that Kant renders problematic in his exposition of the 'pure' form of taste. Kirwan concludes from these examples that Kant has shown, albeit inadvertently, the operation of an interest in the judgment of taste; despite the fact that it is a defining characteristic of the experience of such judgments that they should by the subject, as disinterested. Kirwan proposes how this disinterest might be rendered necessary by the form of interest summarizes the conclusions of the book, and explicitly links the judgment of taste to Kant's own description of vain wishing, that is, to `the presence of desires in man by which he is in contradiction with himself'.<br /><br />In his preface to the Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant, in explaining his reasons for turning to aesthetic judgment, writes that if there is to be a metaphysics, `the critique must previously have probed the ground for this structure down to the depth of the first foundations of the faculty of principles independent of experience, so that it should not sink in any part, which inevitably lead to the collapse of the whole'. It is a central thesis of this present work that, in fact, the aesthetic is to be identified with that `vain-wishing', those `fantastic desires', that Kant describes, in the Critique of the Power of Judgment itself, as the chief psychological obstacle to the process of Enlightenment. Although there is no space in the present work to address the broader historical and philosophical issues that might arise from setting these two facts beside one another, Kirwan  is convinced that such a juxtaposition does not have profound implications for what has come to be known as `the Enlightenment project'. In order to show how it might one would first need to prove, what seems highly improbable, that a rational basis for taste is necessary to this project. The only lesson of more general application to be derived from Kant's unsuccessful attempt to push the aesthetic, in the form of the sublime, in the direction of the rational is that taste cannot be co-opted to serve the interests either of the cognitive or the ethical. Indeed, it is to Kant's credit that, in keeping with most British eighteenth-century thinking on the subject, he does not believe that the aesthetic in general can be so co-opted to either the true or the good. That particular fallacy had to wait until the following century, which then bequeathed it to the twentieth.

This should especially have been true with a work that describes the pivotal figure of Altan Khan, who signed the 1571 peace accord with the Ming dynasty and, most importantly, \\"reconverted\\" the Mongols to Buddhism. However, unlike the Secret History which had achieved an iconic status of near biblical proportions and had been appropriated within the gamut of intellectual agendas (Marxist, nationalist, philological, linguistic, literary, etc.), the Jewel Translucent Sutra languished in an archive for another sixteen years. The exact reasons for this are unclear, although the impact of Cold War politics and the unfathomable dislocations ensuing from Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution cannot be underestimated. Yet now, a generation later and in a much different world, the text and its attendant scholarly investigation has returned.<br /><br />On account of the ascendancy of literary-critical approaches to historical studies, how this work will now be read and interpreted, as opposed to when it first appeared nearly forty years ago, will undoubtedly have changed. And while such a process is seemingly inevitable, oddly enough it also seems appropriate in the case of this work. The reason is that this text meshes with the focus of most late twentieth century scholarship which questions dominant historical narratives, be it feminism, subaltern studies, post-colonialism, etc. All of these approaches entail lifting the blinders of ideological master narratives to reveal the past of those historiographically marginalized. This is not to suggest that Altan Khan has been ignored. Indeed, on account of the extraordinary 1571 Sino-Mongol detente, he has been the focus of extensive scholarship on Ming history and the politics that culminated in the peace process. Similarly, a discussion of Altan Khan's historic 1578 meeting with the Third Dalai Lama that presaged the conversion of the Mongols to Gelugpa Buddhism is a standard topic in all works touching on Tibetan or Mongolian Buddhist history. Yet, the Mongolian voice has been silent in all these works, since until now only Chinese and Tibetan sources have been available and utilized in reconstructing these events. The Jewel Translucent Sutra allows the heretofore marginalized natives to speak.<br /><br />In order to enable access to this source for the widest possible audience with an interest in this particular chapter of the past; however, it is necessary to provide a translation, since knowing or learning Mongolian is not a universal trait. And although currently it is the intellectual and institutional vogue to denigrate such work, to my mind, this is an unfortunate turn in intellectual culture as a whole. It must be recognized that translation is essential, not only in and of itself, but also on account of the fact that any form of critical interpretation is flawed without a proper understanding of the textual sources. A most striking example of such a case has recently been revealed in Davidson's work on classical Greece, which notes that Foucault's misunderstanding of the Greek terms katapugon and kinaidos resulted in his well-known interpretation of a phallocentric culture, as well as the attendant penetration-power schema that shaped his work on ethical systems and power relations. Foucault's views, based on his faulty Greek, still play a powerful role in all the disciplines of the academy. Thus, clearly, the need for accurate readings and translations is of paramount importance. It is with this goal in mind, and as grist for the discourse mill, that the following translation has been prepared.systems and power relations.

G. Collingwood: Philosophy, Politics and the Unity of Theory and Practice by Gary K. Browning (Palgrave Macmillan) Rethinking R. G. Collingwood reviews Collingwood's thought via his own rethinking of Hegel. It establishes the revisionary Hegelian character of Collingwood's defence of liberal civilization in theory and practice. Collingwood is seen as avoiding the pitfalls of Hegel's teleological historicism by developing an open and contestable reading of the rationality of liberal civilization, which neither reduces practice to theory nor philosophy to history. The pre-eminence of philosophy in Collingwood's early thought gives way to a view of experience in which the political defence of civilization arises from and sustains reflective theoretical activities. The contemporary relevance of Collingwood's standpoint is demonstrated by comparing it with those of recent defenders and critics of liberalism - Rawls, Lyotard and Maclntyre. Collingwood is recognized to be both a thoughtful critic of aspects of liberalism, and a provider of a comprehensive justification of its practice.<br /><br />Gary K. Browning is Professor of Politics at Oxford Brookes University.	2004-09-08

First of all, increasing globalization and interdependence, and especially the modem communication technology, have made it possible for us to take part in multicultural dialogue. Contacts across national borders are increasing both in quantity and quality. Globalization and especially the world media have made global problems, such as poverty, underdevelopment and deterioration of the environment, obvious to us. The new search for universal ethics is also due to changes in world politics. The end of the Cold War and the destruction of the Berlin wall, the breakdown of apartheid, and the new role of the United Nations, have spurred an interest in identifying cultural and value-based commonalities. Even though, after the Cold War had ended, it was at first argued that there would be unity around one set of Western values, the effect has rather been the recognition that there is in fact no dominant and persuasive cultural model that compels full admiration and emulation in the way the Western synthesis did in the past. This has opened a new and deeper international, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue.<br /><br />The issue of universal ethics can be studied from many perspectives. The texts of this book have been arranged in five different sections, each of which addresses a significant aspects, different questions and problems of importance in the discussion of universal ethics. In the first part universal ethics are discussed from philosophical and ethical perspectives. Some important and central concepts and demarcations are made. Universal ethics is discussed in relation to three ethical theories; specifically, contract theory, discourse ethics and natural law theory. In the second part, universal ethics is related to human rights. Here, questions on the relation between new and old declarations on universal ethics are investigated. The question of the justification of human rights across normative divides is discussed, as is the relation of human rights to nationalism and minority rights. In the third part, universal ethics is considered in relation to religion. The search for an interreligious ethic is critically investigated, as is the effort to create a European ethic out of Christian values. The question of religious affiliation for a universal ethic is also examined. In the fourth part of the book, universal ethics is discussed in relation to globalization and global governance. The role of the state in an age of globalization is debated, as is the role of culture. The asymmetry of globalization and ethical challenges posed by it are emphasized. In the fifth part, universal ethics is related to Scandinavian values. The question of \\"community values\\" is investigated through the existence and impact of social capital in the Scandinavian countries. The political cultures in these countries are also considered from a historical perspective.<br /><br />The texts of all five parts deal with an important problem of great interest both from theoretical and political perspectives. They give multidisciplinary perspectives on the question of whether universal ethics are at all desirable or even possible. They also give characteristic contributions in that they include not only ethical theory, but also results and perspectives from research within various fields other than philosophy and ethics.<br /><br />The aim of this book is not simply to provide an original contribution to the theoretical discourse on universal ethics within moral and political philosophy. Rather, its aim is to widen the discussion of universal ethics to include questions on how theoretical studies in philosophy and ethics relate to more empirical studies. There have been conferences and books dealing with universal ethics from a strictly philosophical or ethical perspective, but the broad perspective taken in this book is rather exceptional.<br /><br />Prominent researchers, representing several different academic disciplines, have been given the opportunity to relate and discuss their research to the question of universal ethics without demanding that they use a common set of concepts or deal with a specified set of problems. The task of each scholar has been to contribute to questions of the theoretical and practical possibilities of a new form of universalism in ethics from the perspective of the scholar's own discipline. The resulting diversity of this open approach gives the reader of this book a broad and interesting view on the manifold questions concerning universal ethics. The broad perspective does not mean that there are no general observations and conclusions to be drawn from the texts.<br /><br />It is not the intention of this introduction to engage all the texts with each other, but rather to summarise and introduce them. Nevertheless it is interesting to see that there has been no strong objections towards the need for and possibility of a universal ethics. It is obvious that all of the authors have been able to deal with the question of universal ethics in relation to their own field in a most interesting way. All of the texts provide good points of departure for future research of this topic.<br /><br />The texts presented here represent a spectrum of different perspectives on universal ethics. Nevertheless there are some interesting tendencies that can be seen when reading the texts. It is for example obvious that the discussion of universal ethics is considered to be an important concern for all the researchers of the different disciplines of this book. Besides this general approval of the question as such, it is interesting to see that none of the authors strongly reject the idea of a universal ethics of some kind. There are various critiques, problems and objections presented towards some forms of universal ethics, but there is no severe critique of the practical possibility or the pragmatic need for universal ethics as such. On the contrary, there is in most texts an approval of this need and possibility. This approval of the practical possibility and the pragmatic need of universal ethics are of different kinds, from models of justification to empirical findings in favour of existing value communities.

Burg (CABI Publishing) Postharvest Physiology and Hypobaric Storage of Fresh Produce is dedicated to preserving the existing theoretical knowledge, applied research and technology relating to hypobaric storage in order to promote an understanding and appreciation of the method. The author's views regarding the postharvest behaviour of commodities at atmospheric pressure were developed in an attempt to explain the documented advantages of LP vs. CA storage and do not always agree with currently accepted concepts in postharvest physiology. Scientific readers may respond to some of this background information with scepticism and disapprobation, but if at the end of the day researchers are motivated to test these concepts, Postharvest Physiology and Hypobaric Storage of Fresh Produce will have been well worth the time and effort expended in writing.<br /><br />`Controlled atmosphere storage has been the subject of an enormous number of biochemical, physiological and technological studies, yet it is still not known precisely how it works' (Thompson, 1998). Lipton (1977b) commented `It seems after 50 years of work on CA storage, we ought to at least try to see whether there is a common basis for our observations'. LP theory has been developed to a higher degree than the present empirical understanding of CA, but this knowledge is difficult for postharvest physiologists to evaluate unless they possess an intimate familiarity with thermodynamics, mass transport, refrigeration, vacuum technology and the physical laws applicable to an environment resembling that in which earth satellites orbit. It is not possible to plan an LP experiment and interpret its result without considering the manner in which mass and heat are transferred in the medium vacuum range and the influence this has on water loss and the gaseous gradients that arise within a commodity's intercellular spaces. The physical laws governing these processes will be reviewed to assist the reader in understanding the mechanisms that give rise to the unusual results attainable with LP described in the following Table. Postharvest physiologists can easily comprehend the biological factors, but may find the physical computations distracting. Therefore, relevant equations are presented in the Appendix, and computations are included as Examples at the end of each chapter, which the reader can ignore if he so chooses because the text summarizes each example's conclusions and interprets its significance.<br /><br />The low-pressure storage method originally was called LPS or LP. Later, Tolle (1969, 1972) suggested the term `hypobaric'; Rynearson proposed the trade name `DormavacTM' (dormant in a vacuum) to describe Grumman's intermodal hypobaric container and the original `wet' LP method; more recently the service mark `VacuFresh' became synonymous with the `dry' LP method, and `TransVac' with a new `square' LP container design. Frequently used abbreviations throughout the text include RH (relative humidity), CA (controlled atmosphere storage), MA (modified atmosphere storage), NA (normal atmosphere storage), ICC (internal concentration of CO2) and IEC (internal ethylene concentration). Other abbreviations are defined in the index or when they first appear. To simplify comparisons between results obtained at atmospheric and subatmospheric pressures, the O2, CO2 and NH3 concentrations are expressed as per cent [O2], [CO2] and [NH3], where 2% [O2] refers to an O2 partial pressure of 0.02 atm. According to international conventions, the pressure-unit conversion constants are: 1 atm (standard) = 101.33 kPa (kilopascals) = 1013.3 mbar (millibar) = 760 mm Hg (mm mercury) = 760 torr = 14.696 psi (lb/in2).ese processes will be reviewed to assist the reader in understanding the mechanisms that give rise to the unusual results attainable with LP described in the following Table.

His general rules for an ethical system are especially flexible without allowing any easy sophistry that allows us to hoodwink ourselves or others in behaving badly for supposed good reasons.<br /><br />In many ways Gert is the grand old man of practical ethics and this little book should make his procedures available to all who wish to act and access others actions upon a moral grid. A general account of morality with practical and accessible general rules could have revitalizing effect on public discourse and the holding our leaders and their decisions ethically accountable. However the skills suggested in this text may also help one clarify one's own values as well as assess the common good.<br /><br />Moral problems do not always come in the form of great social controversies. More often, the moral decisions we make are made quietly, constantly, and within the context of everyday activities and quotidian dilemmas. Indeed, these smaller decisions are based on a moral foundation that few of us ever stop to think about but which guides our every action.<br /><br />Here distinguished philosopher Bernard Gert presents a clear and concise introduction to what he calls \\"common morality\\"-the moral system that most thoughtful people implicitly use when making everyday, commonsense moral decisions and judgments. Common Morality is useful in that-while not resolving every disagreement on controversial issues-it is able to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable answers to moral problems.<br /><br />In the first part of the book Gert lays out the fundamental features of common morality: moral rules, moral ideals, and a two-step procedure for determining when a violation of a moral rule is justified. Written in a nontechnical style, the ten general moral rules include rules on which everyone can agree, such as \\"do not kill,\\" \\"do not deceive,\\" and 'keep your promises.\\" The moral ideals include similarly uncontroversial precepts such as \\"relieve pain and \\"aid the needy.\\" In the second part of the book Gert examines the underlying concepts that justify common morality, such as the notions of rationality and impartiality.<br /><br />The distillation of over 40 years of scholarship, this book is the most accessible version of Gert's influential theory of morality as well as an eye-opening look at the moral foundations of our everyday actions. Throughout the discussion is clear enough for a reader with little or no philosophy background.<br /><br />Excerpt: A complete moral theory should not be taken to be a theory that provides a unique answer to every moral question. Rather, a complete moral theory should explain and justify the overwhelming agreement on most moral matters while at the same time explaining and justifying the limited disagreement on some of the most important moral matters. Moral theories that provide no explanation or justification for unresolvable moral disagreement are incomplete; those that claim there are no unresolvable moral disagreements are false.<br /><br />A complete moral theory must not only provide analyses of the three concepts that are central to any account of morality-that of morality itself, of impartiality, and of rationality-but also show how these concepts are related to each other. A complete theory must also relate morality to human nature, making it clear why any beings having the essential features of human nature such as fallibility, rationality, and vulnerability would develop a system of morality with all of the features of our common morality. Al-though common morality is a system, it does not remove the need for human judgment. It is true that common morality is systematic enough that a computer could be programmed so that, provided with the facts of the case, it always comes up with acceptable moral answers. However, another computer could be programmed differently and still always come up with acceptable answers. There is no computer program that can tell you which of the competing computer programs you should adopt.<br /><br />We often hear the complaint that scientific advances are out-stripping moral advances, as if we need to make new moral discoveries to deal with the new scientific discoveries and technology. We do need to understand how common morality applies to new situations, but there is no need for moral advances. Common morality, together with an understanding of the new situations created by scientific discoveries and technology, is sufficient to deal with any problem with which we are confronted. However, many people would prefer to make morality seem problematic. It is much harder to act immorally if you recognize that what you are doing is clearly immoral. Hobbes claims that if our interests were as affected by geometry as much as they are by morality, we would have no more agreement in geometry than we have in morality. The purpose of this book is to provide such a clear, coherent, and comprehensive description of morality and its justification, so that no one will be able to deceive himself or others about the moral acceptability of his actions. This will not eliminate immoral behavior, but by making it harder to defend immoral policies, it may contribute to the goal of common morality, which is the lessening of the amount of harm suffered.ough that a computer could be programmed so that, provided with the facts of the case, it always comes up with acceptable moral answers.

And Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy shows how Sartre cannot be understood without taking into account his relations with the intellectual forebears and contemporaries, the lovers and friends, with whom he conducted o lifelong debate. His thinking was essentially a tumultuous dialogue with his whole age and himself. He learned from Gide the art of freedom, and how to experiment with inherited fictional forms. He was a fellow-traveller of communism, and yet his relations with the Party were deeply ambiguous. He was fascinated by Freud but trenchantly critical of psychoanalysis. Beneath Sartre's complex and ever-mutating political commitments, L&eacute;vy detects a polarity between anarchic individualism on the one hand, and a longing for absolute community that brought him close to totalitarianism on the other. L&eacute;vy depicts Sartre as a man who could succumb to the twentieth century's catastrophic attraction to violence and the false messianism of its total political solutions, while also being one of the fiercest critics of its illusions and shortcomings.	2004-08-26

The traditional account of education is that it not only teaches pupils the skills to earn a living, but also teaches a concern for the welfare of others, a love of the many cultures of learning and a commitment to the best values of society. Education and the Good Society examines these considerations and restores them to the centre of the educational debate. To this end, a group of distinguished educational theorists, social critics and practising teachers have come together to describe the many aspects of education which contribute to a good society and in particular those which encourage pupils and students to come out of their education fired by the high ideal to make their society a better place.<br /><br />The contributions deal with the practice of contemporary schools, the governance of learning, the nature of the virtuous teacher, the importance of a moral and political equality, as well as tackling the many defects - some of them wilful and philistine - which presently disfigure educational systems. The purpose of the book is to remoralize the debate about education and to remind readers of the true purposes of an admirable education.	2004-08-25

Improving human rights practices in transition societies should therefore be a central goal for domestic reformers and the international community alike. This makes sense not only because of the intrinsic value of improved human rights protection, but also because of the indirect effects that such improvements have on democratization, economic development, and conflict resolution.<br /><br />The book is a joint effort by 17 scholars from various parts of the world, specializing in political science, sociology, law, and regional studies. It explores the contemporary international human rights regime, the factors predominantly responsible for human rights violations in transition societies, longterm consequences of such violations, and political remedies.	2004-08-25

This is a solid introductory text which competently handles and encyclopedic load of research in a way as to invites the novice to want to learn about human biology, history, culture within the unique naturalistic holism of academic anthropology.<br /><br />Excerpt: Most anthropology instructors have two goals for their introductory classes: (1) to provide an overview of principles and processes of anthropology and (2) to plant a seed of awareness about human cultural and biological diversity in their students that will continue to grow and to challenge ethnocentrism long past the end of the semester. All eleven editions of Anthropology have tried to support and further these goals.<br /><br />The majority of our students come to class intrigued with anthropology but with little more than a vague sense of what it is all about. The first and most obvious aim of the text, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the discipline-its fundamental principles and key concepts. Drawing from the research and ideas of a number of schools of anthropological thought, this book exposes students to a mix of theoretical perspectives-in human evolution and human ecology, as well as theories about culture such as functionalism, structuralism, cultural materialism, and world systems theory. Such inclusiveness reflects our conviction that different approaches all reveal important insights about human behavior, biology, and beliefs. To employ the tools of a single approach at the expense of all others is to cut oneself off from significant insights.	2004-08-25

What are the consequences of such concentrated power for the great masses of people throughout the world? One clearly emerging pattern is the growing disparity between the developed nations and the rest of the world. In this excellent analysis of power distribution and its effects, sociologist Jerry Kloby presents data on the increase of wealth and income inequality, and argues that many of the policies pursued by the developed nations and transnational corporations have led to a deterioration of both living standards and the environment in many parts of the world. He also discusses a power shift in the United States that has weakened the working class.<br /><br />Kloby creates a comprehensive picture of global society from many diverse events and trends-local and international, contemporary and historical. The many graphs and tables containing supporting data guide the reader toward a heightened understanding of the complex forces underlying contemporary developments. He also clearly explains the meaning and relevance of such sophisticated but important terms as neoliberalism, dependency, civil society, and social capital.<br /><br />This fully revised and updated edition will have enduring value for students and scholars of sociology, political science, economics, and international relations.	2004-08-24

Dimitrova (Manchester University Press) (Hardcover) Will joining the European Union help achieve prosperity, stability and democracy in Central and Eastern Europe? This book addresses this question by analysing, from the perspective of new members and current candidates, how the European Union has approached this enlargement, what conditions and criteria have been set and how these have influenced post-communist transformations in a number of areas from constitutional changes to economic and financial reforms and public administrations.<br /><br />More specifically, the book shows how, in its enlargement to the East, the European Union has tried to guide the post-communist states of Central and Eastern Europe towards new institutions and changing rules. In addressing the little explored theme of the link between post-communist transformations and enlargement, the book presents the effects of enlargement governance extended by the EU on domestic processes of reform and transformation in various stages of advancement. While in some cases these effects are extensive, in others domestic reform has already advanced in such a way as to minimise the impact of enlargement preparation.<br /><br />With its rich empirical overview of the reform challenges to various sectors, the book acquaints those interested in the impact of enlargement on the domestic arenas of the new members with a number of scenarios of the interaction of EU rules with post-communist reform. In contrast to other books on enlargement, this book relies primarily on the perspective of scholars and practitioners from Central and Eastern Europe to illustrate the importance of the accession process to reform in their native country.	2004-08-24

It addresses two questions that are fundamental to the workings of local representative democracy: whom or what is it that the councillor elected on a party platform represents, and are those councillors elected to govern a local authority area or to serve and respond to the opinions of their electors. The book examines the impact that political party outside the council chamber and the party groups within it have on the very nature of local representation, on the way in which citizens are able to participate in local politics and on the conduct of council business and political decision-making.<br /><br />The book begins by analysing democratic theory and its relevance to local politics, before considering the role, organisation and activities of political parties in local government, both inside and outside the council chamber. It looks at the dynamics of council chamber politics and how these are influenced by the party system. It considers the approaches taken by the three main parties towards the conduct of local political activity and the way in which parties, and their members, interpret and experience local politics, representation and democracy. The book provides evidence to show that political parties have come to dominate the local political landscape to the almost total exclusion of citizens wishing to become involved in local politics outside the framework of a national party. Political parties serve to delegitimise any political activity not conducted within the very strict definition of local politics constructed and shared by the three main parties. Finally, the book sets out the changes necessary for political parties to make if they are to become meaningful and relevant to the citizens they claim to represent and if local politics is to no longer be the domain of the leviathan that is the political party.<br /><br />The main theme of the book is how those involved in party politics [in the UK] interpret politics, democracy and representation and how they equate representation with governing locally and more importantly with governing through and by the political party. The focus of the book is deliberately on the three main UK-wide political parties, as it is they that have responsibility for shaping and dominating the local political landscape. Indeed, it is the organisation, structure, activities and approach of the three main parties that has resulted in the homogenisation of the conduct of local politics. Smaller parties such as the Greens, the British National Party and the small array of local organisations that have secured election to council chambers, are far from having anything like a significant impact on the dominant practices of local politics shaped by the three main parties. Moreover, the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru are well-established elements of their own nations four party systems and conduct local politics and the politics of the council chamber in broadly similar ways to the three UK-wide parties. Thus, the Conservative and Labour parties and the Liberal Democrats face little challenge when it comes to the conduct of local politics, cast, as it is, in their own images. As a consequence the three main parties are the main, though not exclusive focus of the book.e the domain of the leviathan that is the political party. <br />The main theme of the book is how those involved in party politics [in the UK] interpret politics, democracy and representation and how they equate representation with governing locally and more importantly with governing through and by the political party.

So many of the topical articles in the literature made reference to the Arthur Ahlvers work that I began to feel that it might be of service to present-day classicists to make it available in English, it being less true nowadays than it was fifty years ago that a reading knowledge of German is an unconditional pre-requisite for serious classical scholarship. My casual entertaining of this idea was transmuted into firm resolve by the value of Zahl und Klang bei Platon for my own research. Despite the comparative obscurity of its Swiss author, and both despite and as a result of the unorthodoxy of his interpretations of Timaeus, it threw light on many questions, reinforced a few speculations as to their answers, and thus led me to the no doubt overblown conceit that in my own work I had something to offer the academic public. Translating Ahlvers' book for English-speaking classicists is thus repaying in a small way the multiple favours, presumably posthumous and certainly inadvertent, he has done me.<br /><br />Zahl und Klang bei Platon was published by Verlag Paul Haupt, of Bern, in 1952, as part of the romantically-titled series Noctes Romanae: Forschungen &uuml;ber die Kultur der Antike, under the general editorship of Walter Wili. It deals with a number of interpretative issues surrounding Plato's mathematically-based accounts, derived from Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, of reproduction among the ruling class of the Republic, of terrestrial and celestial music, and of atomic stereometry.<br /><br />More than this, it indicates surprising ways, to be explained later, in which these accounts are essentially connected.<br /><br />Thus, in Chapter I, Ahlvers offers a re-analysis of Plato's derivation of the nuptial number in the Republic, while Chapters II, III and IV are devoted mainly to Timaeus. Chapter II examines the issue of whether or not the Greeks recognized the musical intervals of a third, both major and minor, as consonant. Chapter III proposes a way to explain, by drawing upon a musical interpretation of the geometry of the triangles which compose their faces, Plato's choice of the \\"fairest,\\" half-equilateral, right-angled triangle as the basic unit of this composition, as well as some of the relationships between the atomic shapes of the four elements. In Chapter IV, which in many ways constitutes a postscript, Ahlvers argues that Plato's work in these areas is best understood as Pythagorean rather than Democritean in inspiration.<br /><br />The significant contribution made by Ahlvers to the discussion of the nuptial number concerns not its identification (as 12,960,000) - in which he agrees with most other commentators - but its precise derivation, which occurs in an exceedingly obscure passage of the Republic (VIII 546b3-d3). Ahlvers argues convincingly that Plato wishes the reader to conceive of this number as essentially constituted in terms of the factors 3, 4 and 5, multiplied together, the result being raised to the fourth power. Other commentators, as Ahlvers shows, have reached the same number via differing interpretations of Plato's intentions as to its derivation. To be fair to all, it must be admitted that Plato gives a number of compatible derivations all reaching the same figure of 12,960,000: it is only one part of the relevant passage whose interpretation Ahlvers disputes.<br /><br />In Chapter II the topic switches to the apparently unrelated one of whether Greek music acknowledged the third as a consonance. Contrary to the extant works of early commentators,' Ahlvers believes that the practice of Greek music did involvetreating the thirds as consonant, and,what is more, that Plato's theoretical contributions were fully cognizant of and fully in accordance with this practice. How plausible are his arguments on this score is difficult to assess: yet, while Ido not find them decisive, I think they are well worth examining in detail. The freshness of approach must commend them, even if they offend against orthodoxy. Of particular interest is Ahlvers' suggestion as to Plato's meaning in the passage (Timaeus 35b4-36a5) about inserting arithmetic and harmonic means between the notes defined by the musical tetractys in order to produce the series of consonant intervals, prior to the insertion of the whole tones and semitones required to generate the entire diatonic scale. This suggestion differs markedly, yet plausibly, from the received interpretation, with the result that both major and minor thirds are admitted to the realm of the consonant.<br /><br />Ahlvers turns in Chapter III to the composition out of triangles of the four regular polyhedra which, in Timaeus, form the shapes of the atoms of the four elements.' His distinctive contribution is in the explanation of why Plato uses the right-angled half-equilateral triangle with sides 1, 3 and 2, instead of the equilateral triangle itself, as the basic building block of those polyhedra which have equilateral triangular sides. Briefly put, Ahlvers' explanation is that the ratios of the sides of this triangle are, within appropriate limits of approximation, those required for specifying the proportions' involved in the intervals of the enharmonic division of the fourth. Given certain ideas, here attributed to Plato, about the aesthetics of enharmonicism and thus of this \\"fairest triangle,\\" Ahlvers draws a connection between the beauty of the style of music, the beauty of the triangle and the beauty of the universe constructed, he claims, on their basis. Plato's view then emerges as even more thorough than previously thought in its undisputed application of musical harmony to the composition of the elements of the world.<br /><br />In an interesting digression, Ahlvers builds on the above to offer a fascinating explanation of the uneasy relationship between the equilateral-triangle-faced polyhedra associated with fue, air and water and the square-faced cube associated with earth. The faces of the latter are composed of right-angled isosceles triangles, as opposed to half-equilaterals, and thus do not allow earth to participate in the normal processes of transmutation occurring between the elements, which operate by the dissolution of the atoms into their faces and the reconstitution of these into the other relevant polyhedra.' Plato seems, however, to be uncomfortable with this consequence of his geometric stoichiometry, for elsewhere in Timaeus he appears almost to contradict himself by including earth in the mutual transmutations. By referring to a method of exhaustion attributed to Theaetetus, Ahlvers shows how the square face of the cube can also be regarded as composed, within limits of approximation themselves defined by musical analogy, of the half-equilateral triangles so crucial to the other elements. He thus offers Plato a way to include earth in the processes of transformation, which gives rise, if one wants to explain the apparent self-contradiction, to the suggestion that Plato may have been drawing upon a tradition whose detail he had not fully assimilated.<br /><br />The final Chapter looks more closely at the question of what are the sources for the entire discussion in Timaeus, and in other dialogues which call upon the interrelated subjects of arithmetic, geometry, stereometry, cosmology and music. Ahlvers' conclusion, that Pythagoras looms much larger in the background to Plato than Democritus, seems unassailable on grounds independent of the analyses andinterpretations he offers in the earlier Chapters. Yet these also add to its support, and reaffirm the crucial place of both Plato and Pythagoras in the history of atomism...<br /><br />My goal above all has been to preserve the technical clarity of the original, and to present it to a modem reader in readily accessible form. Ahlvers typifies an approach to academic writing which is less common now than it used to be: he oscillates between steady periods of closely-argued exposition and analysis, on the one hand, and occasional polemical outbursts against competing commentaries, and commentators, on the other. Despite its value as identifying areas where the author is perhaps on slippery ground, I have found it difficult to avoid toning down the vituperation; for one thing, it seems foreign to contemporary philosophical discourse, and thus unnatural; for another, the high degree of invective can only appear unwarranted to a reader who is unfamiliar, as now we all are, with the context of scholarly debate in which Ahlvers was a participant; in each case the danger is that a reader will be distracted from the interpretative point by the tone in which it is expressed.<br /><br />Similar considerations have influenced my attitude to the complex syntax of the German, and in many cases I have resorted to simplification in the interests of clarity, while leaving some instances untouched for the sake of flavor. Ahlvers is fond of the inclusive \\"we,\\" drawing the reader into collusion with him as a co-developer of his account: I have eschewed this attitude in the English, preferring the use of the first-person singular to identify a view or an intention as the author's, but have allowed some innocent \\"we\\"s to remain, when, for example, they are used to invite the reader to accompany the writer in a change of topic.f the world. <br />In an interesting digression, Ahlvers builds on the above to offer a fascinating explanation of the uneasy relationship between the equilateral-triangle-faced polyhedra associated with fue, air and water and the square-faced cube associated with earth.

It has not only served as a reference source for professionals and students, but has provided inspiration to many young people as they developed their interest in science. The late Linus Pauling, in his Foreword to the 74th Edition, wrote \\"I attribute much of my knowledge about substances and their properties to my study of the information that the Handbook provided.<br /><br />Throughout its history the overall philosophy of the Handbook has been to provide broad coverage of all types of data commonly encountered by physical scientists and engineers, with as much depth as can be accommodated in a one-volume format. While the Internet has spawned numerous large, comprehensive databases covering narrow areas of science, we feel there is still a need for a concise reference source spanning the full range of the physical sciences and focusing on key data that are frequently needed by R&D professionals, engineers, and students. We hope the CRC Handbook, in its print, CD-ROM, and Internet formats, can continue to serve these needs.<br /><br />The 85th Edition includes updates and expansions of several tables, such as Aqueous Solubility of Organic Compounds, Thermal Conductivity of Liquids, and Table of the Isotopes.

First, we examine the origin of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Since the regressive turn in current Supreme Court jurisprudence is usually carried out in the name of the Framers' \\"original intent,\\" we look for what must have been the thinking of the Framers of the Constitution as they set up a tripartite government of checks and balances. We look especially at the role of the judicial branch and conclude that the Framers would applaud the expanded notion of religious liberty that emerged in twentieth-century jurisprudence.<br /><br />Second, we look at the record of the judicial system from 1789 through the 1930s. We learn that the narrow understanding of the First Amendment advocated by today's regressive justices does not reflect the thinking or intentions of the eighteenth-century Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights but rather reflects an understanding of church and state that emerged in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Third, we look closely at the last half century of U.S. Supreme Court decisions on church-state issues, seeing them as a critical battleground for progressives who would further expand religious liberty and for regressives who would subject that liberty to majority rule.<br /><br />The resolution of these two issues in favor of an ever-expanding religious freedom-what Justice O'Connor calls \\"well-settled First Amendment jurisprudence\\"-is now under assault. Religious liberty or conscience is in jeopardy, threatened by those who in our view woefully misconstrue the course of religious freedom in America.	2004-08-24

Ockham's is no exception. The principles of the divine omnipotence and the rule of parsimony of thought known as 'Ockham's razor', and others like the principle of non-contradiction, help to shape the entire range of his thought. Many of his conclusions on matters as diverse as God's knowledge, will and power, on creation and the causality of natural things, and on human intuition and morality are reducible to them. These principles are not unique to Ockham but were common to all the scholastics. Yet it is precisely in confrontation with the views of his predecessors and contemporaries such as Scotus, Henry of Gent, Aquinas and Chatton that the particular force and character of his thought are revealed. Over and again he sets each principle to powerful use, but allows no single one of dominate, or to yield all its consequences. Martin Heidegger once declared, 'Every thinker thinks but one single thought'. The original and focal point of Ockham's thought is the singular or individual thing (res singularis), as common nature (natura communis) is the central conception of Scotism, and the act of existing (esse) is of Thomism. With Ockham the traditional conjugations of being come to signify the thing itself in its ineluctable unity. The concept of being is univocal, standing for and signifying individuals. A being is radically diverse and incommunicable, differing from every other being not only in number but also in essence. Indeed, an individual thing can no longer be said to have an essence; it is an essence. Ockham takes his place among the great philosophers because, like them, he drew out all the implications of his insight. He remains a seminal thinker: his denial of common essences, his emphasis on language in philosophical discourse, all anticipate significant developments in modern philosophy.philosophical discourse, all anticipate significant developments in modern philosophy.	2004-08-23

Labrie begins with a discussion of the Catholic imagination and sensibility and considers the relationship between art and Catholic theology and philosophy.<br /><br />Central to Catholic belief is the doctrine of the Incarnation, wherein human experience and the natural world are perceived as both flawed and redeemed. This doctrine can be seen as the axis on which Catholic American literature in general rests and from which variances by particular authors can be measured. The optimism implied in this doctrine, together with an inherited American political consciousness, allowed a number of Catholic authors, from a culture otherwise perceived as outside the American mainstream, to identify with a political idealism that granted dignity to the individual.<br /><br />Counterpointing this emphasis on the individual, though, is the doctrine of the church as an intermediary between God and humanity and the belief in the community of saints. In concert with the doctrine of the Incarnation, these teachings gave Catholic writing a communal and prophetic dimension aimed at the whole of American society.<br /><br />Separate chapters are included for each of the writers considered so that the distinctiveness of their works is elucidated, as well as the unity and the rich diversity of Catholic American writing in general. Some of the authors considered are Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Allen Tate, Robert Lowell, Thomas Merton, and Mary Gordon.<br /><br />A concluding chapter examines the significance of the corpus of Catholic American writing in the years 1940 to 1980, considering it parallel in substance to the body of Jewish American literature of the same period.

As well as revisiting Aquinas's own work, Kerr brings together a range of views that have previously appeared in disparate places, thereby exploring alternatives to the standard understanding of Aquinas's writings. This book therefore represents a major revisionist treatment of Thomism and its significance, combining useful exposition with original, creative thinking.<br /><br />After Aquinas will become essential reading for all undergraduate students and scholars interested in the work of this great theologian.<br /><br />Excerpt: The hard question is to account for the rival ways of reading Thomas. The mid-nineteenth-century revival of interest, primarily in his supposedly Aristotelian philosophy, was intended to put it to use in containing and eradicating the supposedly Cartesian/Kantian subjectivist individualism by which Roman Catholic thinkers were then attracted. This use of Thomas, as we saw in chapter 2, remains effective in the context of analytic philosophy. It may, however, soon have to deal with a threat from medieval scholarship: anachronism is always a risk when one calls on earlier thinkers to refute current arguments. Anyway, the standard outsider's view of Thomas owes everything to Leonine Thomism: at worst, `arid Aristotelianism', at best a combination of natural theology and natural law ethics which satisfies some and repels others.<br /><br />On the inside, so to speak, among those educated in institutions where Leonine Thomism was all but mandatory, it was being rejected by the 1920s. Initiated by such remarkable interpreters as Pierre Rousselot and Joseph Mar&eacute;chal, many students of Thomas concluded that Cartesian/Kantian philosophy could not be outwitted by being regarded as a total mistake; rather, Thomas had to be reread in the light of modern philosophical considerations. The `Copernican revolution' inaugurated by Kant, in his focus on the active role of the knower and the autonomy of the moral agent, turned out, in this rereading, to be anticipated in Thomas's conception of the natural drive of the mind towards truth and being. Far from being a supposedly empiricist epistemology, with the 1 mind being conformed to things in the world, Thomas viewed every act of knowing and choosing as implicitly knowing and choosing the truth and goodness which is the mystery of the divine being. This generated transcendental Thomism.' Kant's analysis of experience is `transcendental', in the sense of getting behind actual experience to lay bare the conditions which make it possible at all. This reading of Thomas disclosed the a priori conditions that Thomas took for granted in his understanding of human experience: namely, that in every act of knowing and loving the human being is tacitly and no doubt mostly unwittingly growing closer to (or further away from) God.<br /><br />In a somewhat different way, theologians of the same generation, notably Henri de Lubac, reconnected Thomas's thought with the patristic tradition: in short, as we saw in chapter 8, retrieving his under-standing of the human spirit as created in the divine image and naturally desiring the face-to-face vision of God which of course can be granted only as a gift. This puts an end to the two-storey view of grace and nature, setting the two over against each other, in favor of under-standing human life under divine grace as the perfection of human nature. Opponents of this view feared that human nature as always already graced, human reason as always already anticipating beatific vision, and human desire as alwaysalready fulfilled in charity, smoothes out the tensions and contradictions and risks allowing nature, reason and desire to collapse into grace, faith and charity - or, by naturalizing the latter, turning Christian life into a form of secular humanism.<br /><br />In his book on Karl Barth, Hans Urs von Balthasar rejected `sawdust Thomism' in favour of de Lubac's retrieval of Thomas's doctrine of natural desire for God. Balthasar's main concern, however, was to put Thomas's thought back into the context of the entire Western meta-physical tradition, understanding this as repeated disclosure of the divine goodness, truth and beauty, consummated in the self-revelation of God in the Christian dispensation of grace. Above all, Balthasar sought to bring out the importance of Thomas's insistence on the distinction in creatures between their nature and their existence, or, rather, on the complete absence of any such distinction in God.<br /><br />Thomas, we may agree, is a transitional figure: later than the monastic theology and sacramental sense of the world which we find still in the early thirteenth century, earlier than the fourteenth-century developments that opened tensions and contradictions between nature and grace, reason and faith, and so on, leading eventually to the rejection (in the West) of Aristotle and Christian Platonism. It is not easy, nowadays, to believe in the harmony of reason and faith for which the High Middle Ages, or at least Thomas Aquinas, were once celebrated. It remains an option, on the other hand, to take Thomas either as a key figure in the development of modern theology or as primarily a continuator of pre-modernity. He can be read as inaugurating modern philosophy of religion, but only if his conceptual apparatus, and in particular his understanding of causality and substance, are assumed to anticipate the standard modern view. If, on the other hand, he has a notion of agent causality, and of self-diffusive substance, we find ourselves on a different hermeneutic line altogether.<br /><br />Similarly with his conception of moral theology as principally an ethics of divine beatitude, and with his conception of sanctification as deified creaturehood, we are once again reading Thomas in the light of theological traditions he inherited, rather than in that of modern and in particular post-Reformation problems.<br /><br />Sometimes, no doubt, this or that interpretation must be regarded as simply mistaken. On the whole, however, more complex factors are at play. For those who have been trained in analytic philosophy, and are inclined to accept Frege's principle that `existence is not a predicate', Thomas's talk of `Being' will (as Anthony Kenny says) be `sophistry and illusion'. On the other hand, for those who believe Heidegger's grand<br /><br />narrative about the forgetfulness of Being in the metaphysical tradition, Thomas's talk of `Being' will either be `idolatry' or (with Balthasar) the wonderful exception to Heidegger's rule. While there are recent attempts to show that analytic philosophy and hermeneutic/deconstructionist philosophies are not as radically incommensurable as they look, it seems unlikely that students of Thomas from these rival traditions will ever take each other very seriously, let alone come to any common understanding.<br /><br />Perhaps we should rescue Thomas from philosophy altogether - but then, after all, he is a great philosopher, indeed that is one of the sources of the ambivalence of his thought. He is a philosopher and he is a theologian, and we are never going to agree where to put the emphasis.<br /><br />In short, as some readings of his natural law theory seem to show, incommensurable yet equally plausible, Thomas's thought, perhaps over a range of issues, contains within itself the Janus-like ambiguities that generate competing interpretations which can never be reconciled. Working out a doctrine of God and of creation in conjunction with Jewish and Islamic metaphysics, a Latin theologian in the new university environment referring all the time to great monastic theologians of the Eastern Church, a Catholic theologian haunted by Catharist dualism, more concerned to protect the faith of friends in the arts faculty against Islamicized Aristotelianism than to avoid alarming his colleagues in divinity with his Aristotelian insights - all along the line Thomas's work, we may surely say, offers readers today little of the `synthesis' and `equilibrium' for which it was widely admired 50 years ago, but, on the contrary, reveals a loose-endedness in its constantly repeated discussions of finally unresolvable problems: `straw', Thomas called his work, in comparison with the knowledge of God for which he hoped and prayed; sketches, we may say, that he made in the course of his long and involved journeyings./>Similarly with his conception of moral theology as principally an ethics of divine beatitude, and with his conception of sanctification as deified creaturehood, we are once again reading Thomas in the light of theological traditions he inherited, rather than in that of modern and in particular post-Reformation problems. <br />Sometimes, no doubt, this or that interpretation must be regarded as simply mistaken.

The Catholic Tradition by Thomas Langan (University of Missouri Press)<br /><br />\\"This is a remarkable work. There are few who possess Langan's historical knowledge and philosophical depth. His reading of the past is informative, insightful, and provocative, all at once. . . . Anyone who wishes to know what Catholicism is, friend, foe, or uninformed Catholic, will find this volume a veritable treasure.\\"--Jude P. Dougherty<br /><br />In his Tradition and Authenticity in the Search for Ecumenic Wisdom, Thomas Langan argued that the close interaction of traditions in today's society calls for methodical critical appropriation of the beliefs fostered by the principal traditions. He also promised to demonstrate by example how such appropriation could be accomplished. In The Catholic Tradition, Langan successfully fulfills that vow by showing how a tradition--the Catholic--has shaped his own outlook.<br /><br />In this comprehensive study, Langan examines the history of the Catholic Church and the origins of its teachings since the Church's conception. Although committed to the Catholic religion, Langan does not obscure the Church's failings as he lays out the fundamentals of the Catholic faith.<br /><br />He provides insight into the great Christological councils, discusses the differences in the spiritualities of East and West, and portrays the crucial roles that the pope and bishops played during the Middle Ages. He incorporates the thought of Augustine, Aquinas, and medieval Catholicism as he traces the rise and decline of Christian Europe, the great issues raised by the reform: priesthood, the Eucharist, spirituality, and Church structure.<br /><br />Satan has no greater triumph, Langan asserts, than when Catholics, who are recipients of the Good News of God's universal love, allow selections from their tradition to be turned into sectarianism and ideology. This balanced history of the Church as human reality faces such perversions squarely. But despite betrayals by its own across the centuries, the Catholic tradition, with its origin at Sinai, remains the oldest and largest extant religious institution.<br /><br />In a last section Langan offers a unique overview of the church's present situation, its strengths and weaknesses, the new movement and the challenge of the \\"new evangelization.\\"enturies, the Catholic tradition, with its origin at Sinai, remains the oldest and largest extant religious institution.  <br />In a last section Langan offers a unique overview of the church's present situation, its strengths and weaknesses, the new movement and the challenge of the \\"new evangelization.\\"  <br />	2004-08-23

Hibbs (Revisions: a Series of Books on Ethics: University of Notre Dame Press) investigates the intent, method, and structural unity of Thomas Aquinas's Summa Contra Gentiles. In this innovative study Thomas S. Hibbs goes against the grain of most traditional interpretations of the work, which claim it serves a missionary or apologetic end, and argues that the intended audience is Christian and that its subject is Christian wisdom. In the process of making his argument, Hibbs also demonstrates that the Summa Contra Gentiles is the most important of Aquinas's texts on the relationship between faith and reason, theology, and philosophy.<br /><br />Since the prologue to the Summa Contra Gentiles has been the focus of nearly all the debates over the work, Hibbs begins with an examination of it and the controversies it has provoked, and tests various interpretations of the prologue in light of the actual text. He then goes on to suggest that the method of the Contra Gentiles is dialectical and that its unifying principle is provided by the narrative structure of scripture. The next chapters are devoted to each of the Contra Gentiles' four parts and Hibbs argues that any interpretation of the first three books must consider how the order of Aquinas's discussion is driven by a series of dialectical encounters with received opinions, especially those of Aristotle and his commentators. Hibbs further demonstrates how attention to the dialectical method of the work has two advantages: first, it enables readers to avoid misinterpretations of Aquinas's positions on various issues, and second, it allows the reader to recapture something of Aquinas's original pedagogical intent. Dialectic and Narrative in Aquinas also reveals how the dialectical method of the Contra Gentiles is crucial to Aquinas's project of subordinating philosophy to theology, and in the concluding chapter Hibbs considers in detail the narrative unity of the Contra Gentiles and brings themes from Aquinas into conversation with contemporary work in genre theory.nsiders in detail the narrative unity of the Contra Gentiles and brings themes from Aquinas into conversation with contemporary work in genre theory. <br />	2004-08-23

Taking us through Aquinas's theology of God as One and Three, he demonstrates that Trinitarian theology should be a spiritual exercise assisting our movement from self- to God-centeredness. Crucial to the spiritual exercise is the contemplative appropriation of biblical revelation, which, Levering argues, has to be joined to a correspondingly rich metaphysical analysis if the \\"God\\" who is revealed is to be understood in a non-idolatrous fashion. In chapters that broadly follow the structure of Aquinas's treatise on God in his Summa Theologiae, Levering engages with a wide range of contemporary theologians, biblical exegetes, and philosophers.<br /><br />Excerpt: For Aquinas, Trinitarian theology is ultimately ordered to contemplative union, and so at the outset we can note that his Trinitarian theology is not isolated from his doctrine of salvation. In the Eucharistic liturgy, in which the whole Mystical Body shares in Christ's sacrificial fulfillment of Israel's Torah, Christ's members (as the perfect Temple) manifest God's name by worshipping the Trinity. By sharing in the self-emptying form of Christ, revealed by the Spirit in word and sacrament, Christ's cruciform members already mystically \\"see\\" the Father. This liturgical union with the Trinity is contemplative, although as a liturgical union requiring the active holiness of Christ's members, Christian contemplation is not thereby bifurcated or cut off from Christian action. As the Fathers and medieval theologians recognized, the contemplative liturgical union with the Trinity that is enjoyed by believers whose faith is formed by charity, is expressed theologically in contemplative and metaphysical modes.<br /><br />The goal of this book, therefore, is sharing in the Church's manifestation of God's \\"name\\" by renewing the practices of theological contemplation. The first chapter of the book treats sacra doctrina, the sacred teaching or wisdom that is knowledge of God and all things in relation to God. This chapter argues that appropriating the revealed sacred teaching has always demanded, even for the biblical authors, metaphysical questioning. Indeed, the practice of metaphysical questioning constitutes a spiritual exercise that purifies from idolatry those who would contemplate the self-revealing God. This unity between rational investigation and contemplative beatitude finds wonderful expression in St. Athanasius's understanding of human sharing in the divine image:<br /><br />They would be no better than the beasts, had they no knowledge save of earthly things; and why should God have made them at all, if He had not intended them to know Him? But, in fact, the good God has given them a share in His own Image, that is, in our Lord Jesus Christ, and has made even themselves after the same Image and Likeness. Why? Simply in order that through this gift of God-likeness in themselves they may be able to perceive the Image Absolute, that is the Word Himself, and through Him apprehend the Father; which knowledge of their Maker is for men the only really happy and blessed life.<br /><br />The alleged opposition between metaphysics and salvation history in theology founders when confronted with this understanding of salvation (in history) as holy contemplation, an understanding shared by Aquinas.<br /><br />The remaining chapters continue in systematic fashion the book's discussion of divine \\"being\\" with various theologians, most importantly St. Thomas Aquinas.\\" The chapters span the themes contained in Aquinas's treatise on God in the Summa Theologiae 1, qq.2-42. While not directly treating q.43, on the temporal missions of the Son and Spirit, the bookengages this topic by emphasizing the scriptural and soteriological foundation of Aquinas's theology of God.\\" Chapters 2 and 3 address God in his unity, in dialogue with Jewish and Christian theologians whose concern is that Aquinas's account of God's \\"attributes\\" (what one can say about God as one) distort, in a supersessionist and onto-theological manner, the one living God revealed as YHWH to Israel as narrated in the Old Testament. Chapters 4 through 7 then explore aspects of the theology of the Trinity. Chapter 4 asks whether the Paschal mystery of Jesus Christ is revelatory of the Trinity in such a way as to constitute an analogy for the Trinity. This chapter inquires into the modes by which we understand the \\"distinction\\" of Persons in God. The fifth chapter extends this topic by directly considering Aquinas's account of the \\"psychological analogy\\" as a means of under-standing the Persons as subsisting relations. In both the fourth and fifth chapters, at stake is whether Aquinas's analogy for understanding the Trinity is grounded sufficiently in God's revelation in Scripture.\\"<br /><br />The sixth chapter turns to Aquinas's description of the Persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Here the theologians in light of whose work I contextualize Aquinas's views are biblical exegetes. Aquinas's description<br /><br />of the Persons can seem far from the narrative reality that one meets in the New Testament and in the \\"biblical theology\\" practiced by contemporary biblical exegetes. This chapter inquires into whether Aquinas's highly metaphysical (speculative) account treats the themes of \\"biblical theology,\\" and if so, what is gained by Aquinas's nonnarrative approach. Lastly, the seventh chapter addresses the movement in theology towards developing a metaphysics that is properly theological, in other words a Trinitarian metaphysics.

Aquinas's approach retains the integrity of the Old Testament revelation while fully displaying its integration into Christ Jesus' definitive revelation of God.<br /><br />In short, the book aims both at reordering contemporary Trinitarian theology and at identifying further \\"signposts,\\" as Walker Percy might put it, along the contemplative path marked out by God himself in Scripture and tradition.

This book illustrates the use of Laplace, Fourier and Hankel transforms for solving linear partial differential equations that are encountered in engineering and sciences. To this end, this new edition features updated references as well as many new examples and exercises taken from a wide variety of sources. Of particular importance is the inclusion of numerical methods and asymptotic techniques for inverting particularly complicated transforms.<br /><br /> Transform methods provide an alternative and bridge between the commonly employed methods of separation of variables and numerical methods in solving linear partial differential equations. The relationship between the techniques grouped as: Numerical<br /><br /> Techniques, Separation of Variables, Transform Methods and Asymptotic Analysis.<br /><br /> Transform methods are similar to separation of variables because they often yield closed form solutions via the powerful method of contour integration. Indeed, all of the results from separation of variables could also be derived using transform methods. Moreover, transform methods can handle a wider class of problems, such as those involving time-dependent boundary conditions, where separation of variables would fail.<br /><br /> Even in those cases when the inverse of the transform cannot be found analytically, transform methods can still be used profitably. A wide variety of numerical and asymptotic methods now exist for their inversion. Because some analytic aspects of the problem are retained, it is easier to obtain greater physical insight than from a purely numerical approach.<br /><br /> Prerequisites. The book assumes the usual undergraduate sequence of mathematics in engineering or the sciences: the traditional calculus and differential equations. A course in complex variables and Fourier and Laplace transforms is also essential. Finally some knowledge of Bessel functions is desirable to completely understand the book.<br /><br /> Audience. This book may be used as either a textbook or a reference book for applied physicists, geophysicists, civil, mechanical or electrical engineers and applied mathematicians.<br /><br /> Chapter Overview. The purpose of Chapter 1 is two-fold. The first four sections (and Section 1.7) serve as a refresher on the background material: linear ordinary differential equations, transform methods and complex variables., The amount of time spent with this material depends upon the background of the class. At least one class period should be spent on each section. Section 1.5 and Section 1.6 cover multivalued complex functions. These sections can be omitted if you only plan to teach Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. Otherwise, several class periods will be necessary to master this material because most students have never seen it. Due to the complexity of the problems, it is suggested that take-home problems are given to test the student's knowledge.<br /><br /> Chapter 2 through Chapter 5 are the meat-and-potatoes of the book.<br /><br /> The material is subdivided according to whether we invert a single-valued or multivalued transform. Each chapter is then subdivided into two parts. The first part deals with simply the mechanics of how to invert the transform while the second part actually applies the transform methods to solving partial differential equations. Undergraduates with a strong mathematics background should be able to handle Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 while Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 are really graduate-level material. The constant theme is the repeated application of the residue theorem to invert Fourier and Laplace transforms.<br /><br /> In Chapter 6 we solve partial differential equations by repeated applications of transform methods. We are now in advanced topics and this material is really only suitable for graduate students. The first two sections are straightforward, brute-force applications of Laplace and Fourier transforms in solving partial differential equations where we hope that we can invert both transforms to find the solution. Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 are devoted to the very clever inversion techniques of Cagniard and De Hoop. For too long this interesting work has been restricted to the seismic, acoustic and electrodynamic communities.<br /><br /> In Chapter 7 we treat the classic Wiener-Hopf problem. This is very difficult material because of the very complicated analysis that is usually involved. Duffy breaks the chapter into two parts: Section 7.1 deals with finite domains while Section 7.2 applies to infinite and semi-infinite domains.<br /><br /> Features. This is an unabashedly applied book because the intended audience is problem solvers in engineering and the applied sciences. However, references are given to other books that do cover any unproven point, should the reader be interested. Also Duffy tries to give some human touch to this field by including references to the original works and photographs of some of the leading figures.<br /><br /> It is always difficult to write a book that satisfies both the student and the researcher. The student usually wants all of the gory details while the researcher wants the answer now. Duffy tries to accommodate both by centering most of the text around examples of increasing difficulty. There are plenty of details for the student, but the researcher may quickly leaf through the examples to find the material that interests him.<br /><br /> As anyone who has taken a course knows, the only way that you know a subject is by working the problems. For that reason Duffy has included several hundred well-crafted problems, most of which were taken from the scientific and engineering literature.

Because many of these problems are difficult, The author has included detailed solutions to most of them. The student is asked however to refrain from looking at the solution before he has really tried to solve it on his own. No pain; no gain. The remaining problems have intermediate results so that the student has confidence that he is on the right track.

It involves applied biological sciences for investigating the present-day subjects of biosciences, mainly for the industrial, food, and environmental sectors. Principles from such scientific disciplines as biochemistry, bioprocess technology, chemical engineering, enzyme technology, food and fermentation technology, molecular biology, microbiology, microbial technology, etc., are strongly practiced by biotechnologists, chemical engineers, resource, energy, and conservation scientists, process technologists, applied microbiologists, farm and industrial waste technologists, etc., in applying bioresource technology for industrial, food, and environmental applications. Gradual emergence of new technologies for large-scale conversions of renewable raw materials of biological origin to various industrial and energy markets has further widened the scope of bioresource technology. The editor has made a conscious and careful effort to select and discuss vivid topics related with the subject, including biomass, bioenergy, biowastes, production technologies, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, agricultural and food processing residues, municipal wastes, environmental protection, bioremediation, recycling, aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, etc.<br /><br />Forty-four chapters are covered in this encyclopedia, describing the application of bioresource technology in three sectors-environmental biotechnology, food biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology.<br /><br />Part I, Environmental Biotechnology, comprises 11 chapters and 19 articles. The first chapter provides a brief overview of recent advances in biological wastewater treatment. Two related chapters are included, one on re-actors for wastewater treatment (biological reactors, membrane bioreactor, rotating biological contractors, trickling filters, and waste stabilization ponds) and another on treatment of industrial effluents (distillery effluent, pulp and paper mill effluent, removal of heavy metals from wastewater, tannery effluent, and textile and dye effluent). The development of such bioprocesses as biobeneficiation, biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, biofiltration, biological control of air pollution, biomethanogenesis, bioremediation, and microbiologically influenced corrosion are discussed in other chapters in this section.<br /><br />Part II, Food Biotechnology, includes 14 chapters, two of which deal with fermented products, i.e., fermented vegetables products and fermented milk products. Food products production is an important area of food biotechnology, hence several chapters cover the production of food additives, food-grade yeast, mushrooms, nutraceuticals, prebiotics, probiotics, single-cell protein, vitamins, and xanthan gum. A chapter on kefir yeast technology provides information on recent technological developments in this area. The section also includes three chapters on biopolymer application, biotransformations of citrus flavone glycosides, and molecular methods for microbial detection and characterization for food safety.<br /><br />The third and final part, Industrial Biotechnology, includes 19 chapters, incorporating 22 articles. The first chapter in this section, which covers alcoholic fermentation, describes bacterial alcoholic fermentation, fruit-based alcoholic beverages, fuel ethanol from renewable biomass resources, grape-based alcoholic beverages, malted barley, Scotch whiskey, beer, and thermotolerant and osmo-tolerant yeasts for alcoholic fermentation. Three chapters dealing with the production of alkaloids, aflatoxins and other secondary metabolites, amino acids, and antibiotics follow. A chapter on the applications of agro-industrial residues for bioprocesses describes specific examples of industrial residues from the cassava industry, coffee industry, palm oil industry, and seafood industry. Two relatedchapters discuss pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrates and recycling of agricultural by-products and residues for animal feeding. Yet another related chapter discusses solid-state fermentation for the bioconversion of biomass, providing insight about the general aspects, design, engineering, and modeling of solid-state fermentation. Several chapters describe the production of commercially important microbial metabolites and products, such as aroma compounds, biodiesel, biofertilizers, biosurfactants, pigments, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and xylitol. The process of biopulping, outlined in yet another chapter, is significant because it is environmentally friendly and offers several advantages. Enzymes and organic acids from microbial sources have important industrial applications. Several therapeutic enzymes have found new applications to treat dreaded diseases such as cancer. Articles in this section describe the production and application of important enzymes, such as inulinase, laccase, lignin peroxidase, lipase, pectinase, phytase, proteases, xylanase, and L-glutaminase, and organic acids, such as citric acid, gallic acid, and lactic acid.etreatment of lignocellulosic substrates and recycling of agricultural by-products and residues for animal feeding.

This anthology of recent papers is the first collection to address the relation of religion and emotion. Each of the selected pieces is a foundational interpretative essay in the renaissance of the study of religion and emotion. The authors examine attitudes toward and expressions of emotion in a wide range of religious traditions and periods, through various textually based, historical, and ethnographic approaches. Among the themes considered are the relation of emotion to moral or religious norms, the role of emotion in faith, religious emotion as a performance of feeling in ritual con-texts, and the relation of emotion to religious language. Specific topics range from filial emotions and filial values in medieval Korean Buddhism to weeping and spirituality in sixteenth-century Jewish mysticism. A substantial introduction places the essays within the broader context of the study of emotion and elucidates the major themes of the book. This volume provides a much-needed introduction to this growing area of study and will be a valuable resource for scholars and students of comparative religion, anthropology, and psychology.<br /><br /> Excerpt from Editors Introduction: The essays collected in this book is a remarkable interweaving of emotional life with morality, especially on the manner in which emotionality ex-presses, reinforces, is shaped by, and challenges social and moral orders. In this volume the settings for religious emotion vary widely, from medieval Europe and Japan to nineteenth-century Korea and twentieth-century Melanesia and India. An assortment of religious traditions is represented: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and indigenous religions. Much of the analysis in these various studies would comport with the observation of William A. Christian Jr. in Chapter i that &quot;People in society produce their own stimuli-entertainment in the form of theater, games, celebrations, religious rituals-that provoke necessary emotions, whether laughter and fun, tension and release, or weeping and sorrow.&quot; Christian explores the &quot;economy of sentiment&quot; underlying religious weeping in Spain in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. For Christian, Spanish weeping was a learned behavior, and expression of emotion in the religious context accordingly was a matter of individual discernment of cultural expectations for feeling and of the effectiveness of theological ideas and social mores in organizing the timing and expression of emotion in tears. Religious weeping expressed feeling, but at the same time it served as a means to produce a desired emotional state. The public performance of weeping at various times in the annual Catholic calendar was a collective testimony of religiously licit feeling toward God, and the expectation of the performers was that God would respond benevolently.<br /><br /> The investigation of culturally shaped emotional performances in religion has borne fruit with regard to a number of religious traditions. Another body of research illustrates the manner in which the display of emotion in ritual settings, or the depiction of emotion in religious literature, challenges, rather than cooperates with, dominant social mores. In a study of Sufi emotionality, Helene Basu details, in Chapter 2, the way the emotional element in the religious life of Indian Sufis is fundamental to the construction of resistance to traditional social hierarchies. Basu shows how groups of low status manipulate culturally derived understandings of emotion in such a way as to lay claim, through their emotionality, to the pinnacle of social status, and how religious ritual facilitates the performance of such status reversal. Her expositionof the complex nature of local Sufi ritual, where numerous ideological threads-good and evil, male and female, hot and cold, and so forth-are interwoven, reveals both the clarity and ambiguity of a culture of religion and emotion. Her study also exemplifies how a focus on emotion can lead to the discovery of previously unsuspected linkages among the various elements of religious ritual. For Basu, the subversive aspect of religion consists of emotional experiences and cognitions interwoven in the liminal contexts of ritual, where status reversal takes place.<br /><br /> Another challenge to the social order framed by religiously grounded conceptualization and performance of emotion is represented in a study of religious literature and family structure in Korea. In Chapter 3, JaHyun Kim Haboush demonstrates how the depiction of emotion in Buddhist-based popular literature provided a framework for challenging Confucianist insistence on primogeniture and resistance to female filiality. Engaged by Koreans as myth, that literature was embraced as counter-hegemonic discourse and served to delegitimate a dominant Confucian worldview. Its effectiveness in so doing rested on the fact that although it shared with the Confucian worldview a valuation of filial emotion, it depicted love of one's parents in such a way as to critically confront the social logic of Confucianism, to advance a view of the social consequences of filial emotion that Confucianist policy disallowed. Haboush, in focusing on characterizations of emotion in religious literature, is able to identify key contradictions in Korean social life and to demonstrate how ideals and imagery drawn from one religious tradition can be marshaled both to reinforce and to undermine another.<br /><br /> The place of emotion in religious literature is likewise the subject of Debora K. Shuger's study of Renaissance literature in Chapter 4. Shuger aims squarely at the view of the history of Western thought as a struggle between philosophy as the pursuit of truth, and rhetoric as sophistic discourse characterized by emotional play. Offering the example of Renaissance sacred rhetorics-religious writings published between 1500 and 1700-Shuger argues that emotion, taken to be a key element of religious experience, was linked with knowledge in premodern epistemology. Sacred rhetorics were important because they were conceived as the means by which knowledge that was hidden from the mind was made visible. Rhetorical writings, through their appeal to the emotions, allowed persons to fully apprehend truth that was otherwise only vaguely sensed. Religious writings opened pathways to truth by sparking the imagination with images that &quot;make what is unseen accessible to both feeling and thought.&quot; Emotion accordingly was fused with argument. In the sacred rhetorics, emotion and knowledge were &quot;mutually dependent,&quot; joined in the perception of truth and the judgment of propositions, and thereby equally represented in the construction of moral visions.<br /><br /> The association of emotions with cognition likewise is the subject of Harvey Whitehouse's analysis of Melanesian initiation rites in Chapter 5. The &quot;rites of terror,&quot; that is, the ordeals undertaken by initiates, are for Whitehouse more than simple cognitive processes in which the transmission of religious knowledge takes place through a transaction between teacher and pupils. Drawing on psychological research supporting the daim that events are better remembered if they are emotionally rich, and emphasizing the collective aspect of initiation rites-initiates together with their supervisors-Whitehouse argues that &quot;extreme emotions and cognitive shocks become intertwined&quot; in the rites of terror, leaving a &quot;flashbulb memory&quot; of the events. In this way the proceedings form an occasion of collective revelation for all involved, leaving a powerful 1 and living residuum of images (of persons and particular events) that continuously shape religious and political community.<br /><br /> For Shuger, images that appealed to the emotions were the portal to philosophical truth for Renaissance religious writers, and for Whitehouse, the formation of commanding images in initiation rites came about through the combination of emotional and cognitive elements in those events. In Chapter 6, Steven M. Parish, in a study of the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley, proposes, like Shuger, that emotions are judgments and, like Whitehouse, that emotions engage people more powerfully with their world and &quot;prepare people to be agents. The experience of emotion mediates engagement with life, priming social actors to find meaning in events and experiences . . . readying them to act.&quot; Like Whitehouse, he views emotion as more than cognitive judgment, as more than moral discourse. In proposing a middle ground between theories that decontextualize emotion (i.e., in favor of universal psychological/physiological processes) and those that disembody it (i.e., those that focus exclusively on its cultural embeddedness), he argues that the Newar feel moral evaluations as well as experience them cognitively. For Parish, moral emotions are moral judgments in the sense that feelings embody moral evaluations. Persons do not form judgments based solely on their understanding of social norms, but actually feel the pain of shame or remorse in their moral orientations. The heart, nuga: as the center of emotional life, actually hurts, flutters, and sinks. Through this embodiment of emotion and moral judgment, Newars frame a worldview, they &quot;ethicize and sacralize mind, emotion, and self and come to know themselves as moral beings.&quot;<br /><br /> Like Parish, Gary L. Ebersole, in Chapter 7, complicates our understanding of the relationship between emotional expression and moral discourse. In a study of ritual weeping, he observes the tendency of some researchers to vie the tears of other peoples and times through a lens ground by the ideas and cultural assumptions of their own situations. This inclination to universalize the meaning of tears, especially with regard to the moral dimensions of weeping, sometimes includes a view of ritual weeping as faked behavior. Ebersole criticizes such projects as shortsighted, first of all, for their inability to recognize how actors exploit ritual weeping for their own purposes-how they turn cultural expectations into legitimations for personal rather than collective ends-and second, for how they depersonalize those who participate in ritual weeping, rendering them passive players, emotionally disconnected as they go ' through the motions of a collective drama. He proposes that ritual weeping be viewed as &quot;symbolic activity that marks out the existence or the breach of social and/or moral relationships&quot; so that some weeping might be understood as resistance to social norms, rather than performance of them. Or, as in the case of filial emotion in Korea, weeping may have contested meanings. For Ebersole, the moral discourses represented in incidences of ritual weeping are complex, at times even contradictory, and consist of meanings framed by personal interests as well as social expectations.<br /><br /> The fact of variant meanings of an emotional performance is directly addressed in Chapter 8 by Paul M. Toomey in observing three bhakti traditions at Mount Govardhan. Arguing that bhakti devotionalists objectify emotion as food, Toomey takes a forthrightly constructivist position, and as such his approach shares much with Basu's. But where Basu focuses on evidence of conceptual correspondences across an extended sample of contexts-cosmic, gender, social status, and so forth-to strengthen her claim for coherency among seemingly diverse aspects of religious life, Toomey takes a more explicitly comparative tack. He organizes his study in such a way as to account for variations in the construction of the emotional component of religious pilgrimage. He analyzes how emotion is objectively represented in the ritual of eating, which includes all aspects of setting, menu, preparation (including the identity of the preparer), calendar, duration, and consumption. Material aspects of religious culture, especially icons and food, are associated with emotion as repositories for it, in fact serving as a reservoir for emotion that is transmitted to devotees in the course of the food ritual. In consuming food, persons take into themselves holy emotion supplied to them by the deity. Toomey then shows how variations in the experience of emotion-as motherly love, erotic passion, and so forth-rest on differences in the background of the performers, determined by their membership in one or another of a particular sect of pilgrims.<br /><br /> The association of emotion with material substance is present in many religious traditions. The identification of emotion with food, as in certain cases of bhakti devotionalism, and the association of shame with the pain of the heart among the Newars are two examples of the ways certain aspects of emotionality and morality are materialistically coded. In her analysis of emotion in Bengali religious thought in Chapter 9, June McDaniel writes about the way emotion is &quot;substantial rather than conceptual&quot; in Indian traditions, one part of the Indian universe that is experienced as networks of continually flowing substance. Emotion is not a passive response to the world, but an active engagement in it, a matter of aesthetic and spiritual self-making, in which per-sons arrange emotions (raga, colors) as paints on a canvas as they construct the &quot;subtle body,&quot; or ideal self. McDaniel's interpretation is grounded in analysis of language, especially with regard to the complexes of metaphors that are deployed by Indians in addressing various aspects of emotional life. And, like several of the other authors whose work is represented here, she stresses the difference between Western and Indian approaches to emotion, in particular the Indian focus on intense emotion as opposed to the everyday.<br /><br /> Elliot R. Wolfson in Chapter 10 also focuses on extreme emotion in writing<br /><br /> about sixteenth-century Jewish mysticism. In his exploration of the emotional dynamics underlying the Kabbalists' ecstatic journey to the heavenly realms, Wolfson proposes that weeping served as the focal point for a complex of religious ideas and behavior. Sixteenth-century Jews linked ecstasy with esoteric knowledge and cultivated weeping as an &quot;ecstatic technique&quot; that would gain them that knowledge. Wolfson invokes testimony from the diary of a Jew from that period, Hayyim Vital, arguing that Vital viewed weeping as both the avenue to ecstatic experience and a means to knowledge. Weeping opened the gates of the higher realms, and as such was associated with the ascent of the soul. In this study, Wolfson also demonstrates the manner in which ideas about gender, the phallus, seminal emissions, the symbolism of the eye, sleep, and death were interwoven in Kabbalists' views of the meanings of ecstatic weeping. The picture of Jewish mysticism that emerges is one in which emotional experience itself is the goal of the mystical ritual of weeping, as well as the means by which the soul makes its ascent and obtains gnosis. The performative aspects of mystical emotionality accordingly stand side by side with the acquisition of religious knowledge in this form of Jewish mysticism.<br /><br /> The focus on a single individual, such as Hayyim Vital, can reveal some-thing of the complexities and subtleties of emotional life that the investigation of collective emotional experience cannot. Moreover, in certain cases it is possible to situate an actor within a historical context in such a way as to illustrate that person's creativity in negotiating overlapping individual and collective frameworks for emotional life. In Chapter ii, Catherine Peyroux sets out to describe the &quot;affective world of Frankish nobility&quot; through an analysis of St. Gertrude's furor. Gertrude's anger is linked to her rejection of a suitor proposed to her by her parents. By demonstrating the location of Gertrude's emotionality within the world of feeling of the seventh-century nobles, with particular attention to Gertrude's self-understanding of her betrothal to Christ, Peyroux is able to explain the intensity of Gertrude's response, its religious meaning, and the appeal of the story to her subsequent hagiographers. Gertrude's rage at her parents' presentation to her of a prospective husband reveals both her devotion to God, whom she takes as her only true husband, and her realization that she will open herself to the charge of adultery should she agree to the marriage her parents have arranged. Working from a hagiographic text, Peyroux examines the various possible meanings of the furor therein described on the way to concluding that the saint's rage was in fact taken by her community as a sign of her status as the beloved spouse of Christ. For those who knew her as abbess and for those who engaged The Life of St. Gertrude, her anger represented her religious identity as the bride of Christ, her authority as a spiritual leader, and her keen grasp of the socioemotional codes of the Frankish aristocracy.<br /><br /> Just as cultural codes govern the emotional lives of persons as they interact in various social settings; certain cultural assumptions about emotional aspects of self can frame a group's understanding of the relationship between humans and superhuman beings. Charlotte E. Hardman, in observing Lohorung Rai in Nepal, notes how emotion saturates the relationships of Lohorung with the powerful spirits of ancestors (sammang). In the relatively seamless world of people, nature, sammang, society, mind, body, past, and present, emotion experienced by the sammang is also experienced by the Lohorung. Because of the interconnectedness of all phenomena, the anger of sammang, which can be the result of persons' transgression of social codes for behavior, is also experienced by Lohorung, usually as physical pain or misfortune, such as a landslide. Just as the social expression of anger is accepted and even encouraged by Lohorung in certain situations, so, too, are maladies engendered by the angering of sammang understandable as part of the dynamics of emotion on a grand scale. The &quot;emotion rules,&quot; as it were, are not merely social, they are cosmic. By focusing on emotion as a key to understanding Lohorung conceptualizations of morality, self, and the superhuman, Hardman is able to demonstrate the profundity of the linkages among those aspects of Lohorung culture, and contribute as well to discussions about the embodiedness of emotion alongside its construction in culture.<br /><br /> By linking various aspects of religion-ritual, authority, community, ideas, and other features-to a new center, the study of religion and emotion promises to disclose meanings previously hidden. Thus far, research has taken shape as an assortment of approaches and themes. Like most new academic ventures, it enjoys the luxury of relative freedom from confining academic discourses and, in the absence of a tradition of investigation that maps and authorizes specific terrain, it can explore where it wishes.<br /><br /> The study of religion and emotion is in an early stage, well-begun but still finding its feet, and not yet invested in a secret language, an exclusivistic discourse that identifies it as a field of study and reduces its view to a handful of official themes.

But in the course of that enterprise, it must avoid doctrinaire taxonomies. It must look beyond disciplinary boundaries in theory and method.

The research represented in this volume exemplifies some of the most promising approaches to religion and emotion, but it by no means exhausts them.

As investigation of religion and emotion<br /><br /> from all of these perspectives progresses, it is likely to challenge current paradigms for the study of religion, and it may lead to the reconsideration of the study of religion as a whole.analyzes how emotion is objectively represented in the ritual of eating, which includes all aspects of setting, menu, preparation (including the identity of the preparer), calendar, duration, and consumption. Material aspects of religious culture, especially icons and food, are associated with emotion as repositories for it, in fact serving as a reservoir for emotion that is transmitted to devotees in the course of the food ritual. In consuming food, persons take into themselves holy emotion supplied to them by the deity. Toomey then shows how variations in the experience of emotion-as motherly love, erotic passion, and so forth-rest on differences in the background of the performers, determined by their membership in one or another of a particular sect of pilgrims. <br /> The association of emotion with material substance is present in many religious traditions. The identification of emotion with food, as in certain cases of bhakti devotionalism, and the association of shame with the pain of the heart among the Newars are two examples of the ways certain aspects of emotionality and morality are materialistically coded. In her analysis of emotion in Bengali religious thought in Chapter 9, June McDaniel writes about the way emotion is &quot;substantial rather than conceptual&quot; in Indian traditions, one part of the Indian universe that is experienced as networks of continually flowing substance. Emotion is not a passive response to the world, but an active engagement in it, a matter of aesthetic and spiritual self-making, in which per-sons arrange emotions (raga, colors) as paints on a canvas as they construct the &quot;subtle body,&quot; or ideal self. McDaniel's interpretation is grounded in analysis of language, especially with regard to the complexes of metaphors that are deployed by Indians in addressing various aspects of emotional life. And, like several of the other authors whose work is represented here, she stresses the difference between Western and Indian approaches to emotion, in particular the Indian focus on intense emotion as opposed to the everyday. <br /> Elliot R. Wolfson in Chapter 10 also focuses on extreme emotion in writing <br /> about sixteenth-century Jewish mysticism. In his exploration of the emotional dynamics underlying the Kabbalists' ecstatic journey to the heavenly realms, Wolfson proposes that weeping served as the focal point for a complex of religious ideas and behavior. Sixteenth-century Jews linked ecstasy with esoteric knowledge and cultivated weeping as an &quot;ecstatic technique&quot; that would gain them that knowledge. Wolfson invokes testimony from the diary of a Jew from that period, Hayyim Vital, arguing that Vital viewed weeping as both the avenue to ecstatic experience and a means to knowledge. Weeping opened the gates of the higher realms, and as such was associated with the ascent of the soul. In this study, Wolfson also demonstrates the manner in which ideas about gender, the phallus, seminal emissions, the symbolism of the eye, sleep, and death were interwoven in Kabbalists' views of the meanings of ecstatic weeping. The picture of Jewish mysticism that emerges is one in which emotional experience itself is the goal of the mystical ritual of weeping, as well as the means by which the soul makes its ascent and obtains gnosis. The performative aspects of mystical emotionality accordingly stand side by side with the acquisition of religious knowledge in this form of Jewish mysticism. <br /> The focus on a single individual, such as Hayyim Vital, can reveal some-thing of the complexities and subtleties of emotional life that the investigation of collective emotional experience cannot. Moreover, in certain cases it is possible to situate an actor within a historical context in such a way as to illustrate that person's creativity in negotiating overlapping individual and collective frameworks for emotional life. In Chapter ii, Catherine Peyroux sets out to describe the &quot;affective world of Frankish nobility&quot; through an analysis of St. Gertrude's furor. Gertrude's anger is linked to her rejection of a suitor proposed to her by her parents. By demonstrating the location of Gertrude's emotionality within the world of feeling of the seventh-century nobles, with particular attention to Gertrude's self-understanding of her betrothal to Christ, Peyroux is able to explain the intensity of Gertrude's response, its religious meaning, and the appeal of the story to her subsequent hagiographers. Gertrude's rage at her parents' presentation to her of a prospective husband reveals both her devotion to God, whom she takes as her only true husband, and her realization that she will open herself to the charge of adultery should she agree to the marriage her parents have arranged. Working from a hagiographic text, Peyroux examines the various possible meanings of the furor therein described on the way to concluding that the saint's rage was in fact taken by her community as a sign of her status as the beloved spouse of Christ. For those who knew her as abbess and for those who engaged The Life of St. Gertrude, her anger represented her religious identity as the bride of Christ, her authority as a spiritual leader, and her keen grasp of the socioemotional codes of the Frankish aristocracy. <br /> Just as cultural codes govern the emotional lives of persons as they interact in various social settings; certain cultural assumptions about emotional aspects of self can frame a group's understanding of the relationship between humans and superhuman beings. Charlotte E. Hardman, in observing Lohorung Rai in Nepal, notes how emotion saturates the relationships of Lohorung with the powerful spirits of ancestors (sammang). In the relatively seamless world of people, nature, sammang, society, mind, body, past, and present, emotion experienced by the sammang is also experienced by the Lohorung. Because of the interconnectedness of all phenomena, the anger of sammang, which can be the result of persons' transgression of social codes for behavior, is also experienced by Lohorung, usually as physical pain or misfortune, such as a landslide. Just as the social expression of anger is accepted and even encouraged by Lohorung in certain situations, so, too, are maladies engendered by the angering of sammang understandable as part of the dynamics of emotion on a grand scale. The &quot;emotion rules,&quot; as it were, are not merely social, they are cosmic. By focusing on emotion as a key to understanding Lohorung conceptualizations of morality, self, and the superhuman, Hardman is able to demonstrate the profundity of the linkages among those aspects of Lohorung culture, and contribute as well to discussions about the embodiedness of emotion alongside its construction in culture. <br /> By linking various aspects of religion-ritual, authority, community, ideas, and other features-to a new center, the study of religion and emotion promises to disclose meanings previously hidden. Thus far, research has taken shape as an assortment of approaches and themes. Like most new academic ventures, it enjoys the luxury of relative freedom from confining academic discourses and, in the absence of a tradition of investigation that maps and authorizes specific terrain, it can explore where it wishes. <br /> The study of religion and emotion is in an early stage, well-begun but still finding its feet, and not yet invested in a secret language, an exclusivistic discourse that identifies it as a field of study and reduces its view to a handful of official themes. To realize its ample possibilities, however, it eventually will have to generate classifications of its subject matter and develop linkages among its various foci. But in the course of that enterprise, it must avoid doctrinaire taxonomies. It must look beyond disciplinary boundaries in theory and method. It must remain sensitive to the differences and similarities between culturally constructed standards for emotion and the actual emotional experiences of people. The research represented in this volume exemplifies some of the most promising approaches to religion and emotion, but it by no means exhausts them.

The consequences of all of this research may be far-reaching.

Kirk, Kristin Marholm, Gretchen L. Wagner, Milwaukee Museum of Art (Hudson Hills Press) 531 colorplates and 9 black-and-white illustrations A good overview of prints by early 20th Century masters.<br /><br />Widely acclaimed as one of the most significant bodies of German Expressionist prints in the United States, The Marcia and Granvil Specks Collection is noted for its high quality, breadth, and profound graphic power. In celebration of its gift to the Milwaukee Art Museum, it is presented here for the first time as a whole, as a body of imagery that reveals the myriad concerns of the age-the joys and pain of life in Germany from the 1890s to the 1930s.<br /><br />The Specks collection is a vast mirror reflecting that complicated and fiery period when printmaking asserted itself, when images impressed on paper became the most profound and exacting expressions of the age. From the tragic and sorrowful prints of K&auml;the Kollwitz to the profoundly human religious woodcuts of Karl Schmidt-Rottluff to the biting satire of radical artist George Grosz, the collection illuminates the sense of urgency, originality, and vision of a wide range of artists, all attempting to limn a shifting world of despair, hope, and renewal in the fragile years from the Second Empire to the rise of the Nazis. Etchings and drypoints of biting spontaneity and intensity, lithographs of corrosive ingenuity, woodcuts to stir the soul, heralded an era of individuality and democracy in visions of a new society that could be reproduced, illustrated, and mass produced to reach the most remote and casual of observers. Emotionally, technically, and rebelliously, prints offered artists fresh directions and challenges at a time of intense preoccupation and ultimately disillusionment with society and the world.<br /><br />Within this broad terrain, the publication of The Marcia and Granvil Specks Collection constitutes an extraordinary opportunity to delve assiduously into an entire generation of remarkable images and artists. The stunning quality and vast range of prints, personally researched and selected by the Specks during countless trips to Europe over three decades, offer riches unparalleled in any other American collection of Expressionist prints-everything from the most iconic, rare impressions to remarkable prints by artists little known in the United States. In its totality the collection invites repeated viewing and comparison of similar themes and media by an array of artists over several decades. In its specifics there are areas of strength that reach the highest levels of excellence, importance, and expressive mastery.<br /><br />In addition to the illustrated catalogue of over 475 prints accompanied by biographies of the artists, the book includes essays discussing issues of visual culture and representation by leading scholars in the field: Reinhold Heller, Professor of the History of Art at the University of Chicago; and Stephanie D'Alessandro, Assistant Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at The Art Institute of Chicago.

Major Milton Reference Released.<br /><br /> Paradise Lost, 1668-1968: Three Centuries of Commentary edited by Earl Roy Miner, co-edited by William Moeck, Steven Edward Jablonski (Bucknell University Press, Associated University Presses) This creative resource compiles and checks the best of previous commentarial scholarship on Paradise Lost. Over 15 years in the making, this volume should become the preferred companion for a close reading of the poem.<br /><br /> This Commentary, the first book-length work of this kind on Paradise Lost since the Richardsons' in 1734, combines resources in lieu of a true variorum edition no longer possible. It includes the best commentary from &quot;Annotations&quot; like Patrick Hume's (1695), the first full-length commentary on any English author, as well as annotations to the variorum editions of Newton (1749) and Todd (1801-42) and the modern professional editions culminating in Alastair Fowler's (1968).<br /><br /> Other elements combined in this Commentary include an essay on the pre-annotative criticism from 1668, including that by Marvell, Dryden, and Dennis; copious use of the OED; numerous cross-references to Milton's other works and passages in Paradise Lost; fourteen excurses and other contributions by the present editors.<br /><br /> This Commentary uniquely presents biblical, classical, and vernacular citations in which every cited passage is quoted, and every quotation is in English. It is itself a research library for Paradise Lost, and only a text of the poem is required.<br /><br /> The Editor, Earl Miner, was Townsend Martin, Class of 1917, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Princeton University. A scholar of inestimable breadth and quality, he distinguished himself in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century studies, in poetics, translation, and the Classical traditions in English literature, as well as in Japanese literature and comparative literature.

In Part II, mystics from five religious traditions are selected to examine the complexities of mysticism and morality. In Part III, the relation of types of mystical experience to morality is discussed, as will the issue of social action. Finally, what impact classical mystics' ideas on values and morality can have on the contemporary world is addressed.<br /><br /> In Part II, the truth of the traditions' factual claims is not be questioned but simply accepted; the objective of this study is to examine the ethics of these traditions and to see how morality does or does not figure in them. Both values (in particular, the central issue of concern for others) and factual beliefs (whether they permit or foreclose morality) is examined. The mystical path and the enlightened state are of central importance to the shape of moral claims. The amount of exposition varies from tradition to tradition-Daoism requires more because it is open to so many diverse interpretations, while Jainism requires very little because only a few points are of importance here. This a philosophical study of the moral status of mystical traditions, rather than a comprehensive survey of the ethical rules and norms of the different traditions.<br /><br /> From the various tradition individual mystics as exemplars are selected to illustrate the variety of positions and the issues involved examining mystical attainment and ethical behavior. The study is necessarily selective and not a comprehensive assessment of all mystical paths in these traditions. First, Jones focuses upon the &quot;classical&quot; mystics unaffected by modem Western scientific, philosophical, and ethical thought (although a few contemporary practitioners are noted in passing). Second, even within the selected religious traditions the survey snapshottish: only basic texts and representative mystics of chosen subtraditions are discussed. The foundational texts of a tradition or subtradition is the focus for the Eastern traditions, but for Christianity Jones' focus is especially on the medieval period with its rich scholastic mystical practice. The selection within Hinduism and Buddhism is partial but at least sufficient enough to show that there are different points of view within the same tradition. I missed some recognition of Judaism and Islamic mystical traditions but it is doubtful that their inclusion would have affected the analysis in the philosophical portions of the book, especially in part III where modernity as antimystical is most strongly asserted.).

Ever since its first appearance, when Callimachus called it a great evil, Argonautica has been regarded as a weak imitation of Homer. And yet all the critics (except perhaps Callimachus) have agreed that Apollonius' treatment, in Book III, of Medea's falling in love is sensitive, skillful, and shows a deep understanding of human psychology. How can a blunderer like Apollonius have created something so sublime?<br /><br />In this work Byre gives this neglected some refreshing analysis, if not dispelling the distain with which it is held, then at least demonstrating that this text has more literary levels than previously supposed.<br /><br />Byre raises the daring suggestion that perhaps Apollonius was not a blunderer and that perhaps he was not trying to be Homer. Byre further suggests that much of what has been criticized in Argonautica- Jason's indecisiveness, the confused and conflicting aims of the gods-reflect the same skillful psychology for which his portrait of Medea is praised; an awareness of the conflicts that are a continual part of all our behavior, and our uncertainty about the respective roles of fate and chance in our careers.<br /><br />Byre shares with Apollonius a shrewd appreciation of the human mind, combined with the kind of scholarly meticulousness that shaped Argonautica. In this book he reveals Argonautica to be a poem of surprising depth and complexity, in which things are seldom what they seem and never to completely understood. Perhaps Apollonius would have approved.	2004-07-27

Peterson, Raymond J. Vanarragon (Contemporary Debates in Philosophy: Blackwell Publishers) (Paperback) Contemporary Debates in the Philosophy of Religion features newly commissioned debates on some of the most controversial issues in the field. For example: Is evil evidence against belief in God? Does science discredit religion? Is God's existence the best explanation of the universe? Is eternal damnation compatible with the Christian concept of God? Is morality based on God's commands?<br /><br /> This first title in Blackwell's Contemporary Debates in Philosophy series presents important philosophical issues in a stimulating and engaging manner. Twelve central questions are posed, with each question addressed by a pair of opposing essays. The debates range from vigorous disagreements between theists and their critics to arguments between theists of different philosophical and theological persuasions. Both students and scholars in the philosophy of religion will readily sense the value of rigorous debate for sharply defining the issues and paving the way for further progress.<br /><br /> Contributors: William R. Alston, Lynne Rudder Baker, David Basinger, Michael Bergmann, Craig A. Boyd, Peter Byrne, Stephen T. Davis, Evan Fales, Richard M.

Schellenberg, Thomas Talbott, Raymond J. Vanarragon, Jerry Walls, John Worrall, Keith E. Yandell, Dean W. Zimmerman<br /><br /> This is the first book in Blackwell's &quot;Contemporary Debates&quot; textbook series. It is designed to feature some of the most important current controversies in the philosophy of religion. In the Western philosophical tradition, theism - the belief that an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God exists - has been the focus of much philosophical debate and discussion. Although not a living religion itself, theism forms a significant conceptual component of three living religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Moreover, beliefs within living religions - particularly beliefs of the historic Christian faith - have also occupied the attention of philosophers of religion. So, in staking out the territory for this book, we selected some issues related to classical theism and some related to Christian faith in particular.<br /><br /> Most Anglo-American philosophy is oriented toward the rigorous analysis of ideas, arguments, and positions - and this orientation certainly flourishes in the philosophical treatment of religion. Since the analytic approach lends itself to crisp, straightforward debate, we have made &quot;debate&quot; the central motif of the book. With its most notable origins in Socratic dialectic, debate is essentially the interplay between opposing positions. Each debate here is organized around a key question on which recognized experts take drastically different positions. For each question, one expert on the subject presents an affirmative position and develops his or her argument, and another presents a negative position with a corresponding argument. Brief responses are also included to allow writers to clarify further their own positions, identify weaknesses in the opposing position, and point out directions for further discussion. Each debate on a given question has a short editorial introduction, and then the following structure: affirmative essay, negative essay, reply to negative position, reply to positive position.<br /><br /> Teach the conflicts! We are convinced of the pedagogical value of teaching vigorous, well-argued debate for encouraging students to sharpen their own critical abilities and formulate their own points of view. The noteworthy growth and vibrancy<br /><br /> of contemporary philosophy of religion provide a wide range of exciting topics for debate. From this rich vein of discussion, we have chosen topics that fall into three general categories: those involving attacks on religious belief, those involving arguments for religious belief, and those involving internal evaluation of the coherence or appropriateness of certain religious beliefs. In the first two categories, the debates are waged between theists and nontheists; in the last category, the debates are largely between religious believers who differ over the implications of their faith commitments. In all, these debates provide an ideal format not simply for students but also for professional philosophers and interested nonprofessionals to explore issues in the philosophy of religion.en topics that fall into three general categories: those involving attacks on religious belief, those involving arguments for religious belief, and those involving internal evaluation of the coherence or appropriateness of certain religious beliefs.

Everitt, Andrew Pickles (Imperial College Press: World Scientific) About 8000 clinical trials are undertaken annually in all areas of medicine, from the treatment of acne to the prevention of cancer. Correct interpretation of the data from such trials depends largely on adequate design and on performing the appropriate statistical analyses. In this book, the statistical aspects of both the design and analysis of trials are described, with particular emphasis on recently developed methods of analysis.<br />According to Sir David Cox, the randomized controlled clinical trial is perhaps the outstanding contribution of statistics to 20th century medical research. Nowadays about 8000 such trials are undertaken annually in all areas of medicine from the treatment of acne to the prevention of cancer. Although the vast majority of these trials take place away from the glare of public interest, some deal with issues that are controversial enough to make even the popular press; an obvious example is the use of AZT for the treatment of AIDS.<br />There are many excellent books available which give comprehensive accounts of how clinical trials should be carried out and organized. The aim of this book is different; the authors attempt to give relatively concise descriptions of the more statistical aspects of the design and analysis of clinical trials, particularly those methods developed over the last decade or so. Topics discussed in this text include randomization, interim analyses, sample size determination, the analysis of longitudinal data, Bayesian methods, survival analysis and meta-analysis. Many examples are included alongside some of the necessary technical material, the more difficult parts of which are confined to tables. An Appendix gives details of relevant software. The book should be useful to medical statisticians and others faced with the often difficult problems of designing and analyzing clinical trials.<br />The controlled clinical trial has become one of the most important tools in medical research and investigators planning to undertake such a trial have no shortage of excellent books to which to turn for advice and information. But unlike the many other books dealing with clinical trials, this text is primarily concerned with the statistical issues of certain aspects of their design (Chapters 2 and 3) and, in particular, their analysis (Chapters 4 to 10), rather than their day-to-day organization. This restriction will enable us to give fuller accounts of some recently developed methods that may be particularly useful for the type of data often generated from clinical trials. Some details of the software available that implements the methods described will be given in the Appendix.ing and analyzing clinical trials.<BR>The controlled clinical trial has become one of the most important tools in medical research and investigators planning to undertake such a trial have no shortage of excellent books to which to turn for advice and information.

Divine, T. H. Breen, George M. Frederickson, R. Hal Williams, Ariela J. Gross, H. W. Brands, Randy Roberts (Pearson Longman Publishers) America Past and Present, Brief Sixth Edition, is de-rived from the full-length America Past and Present, Seventh Edition. The Brief Sixth Edition shares the goal of its parent text: to present a clear, relevant, and balanced history of the United States as an unfolding story of national development, from the days of the earliest inhabitants to the present. The goal of the abridgement is to produce a condensation true to the original in all its dimensions-a miniaturized replica or bonsai, as it were-retaining the style and tone, and the interpretations, with their nuances and subtleties intact. This Brief Sixth Edition contains about two-thirds of the text of the full-length book, more than one-half of the maps, charts, and figures, and a commensurate proportion of the illustration program.<br />Presenting American history as the story of a nation in flux, America Past and Present, Brief Sixth Edition, goes beyond recounting the major events that have helped to shape the nation-the wars fought, the presidents elected, the treaties signed. The impact of change on human lives adds a vital dimension to the understanding of history. How did the American Revolution affect the lives of ordinary citizens? What was it like for both blacks and whites to live in a plantation society? How did the shift from an agrarian to an industrial economy affect men and women alike? What impact did technology, in the form of the auto-mobile and the computer, have on patterns of life in the twentieth century? As the narrative explores answers to these and other questions, it blends the excitement and drama of the American experience with in-sights about the social, political, economic, and cultural issues that underlie it.<br />America Past and Present, Brief Sixth Edition, espouses no particular ideology or point of view; instead the text encourages readers to explore the American past and reach their own conclusions about its significance in their lives. And yet the text does not avoid examining controversial issues but seeks to offer balanced and reasoned judgments on such morally charged subjects as the nature of slavery and the use of nuclear weapons. Although history may rarely repeat itself, the story of the American past is relevant to the problems and dilemmas facing the American nation and the American people today.<br />TEXT REVISIONS<br />The principal revisions in America Past and Present, Brief Sixth Edition, have been undertaken with the goals of clarifying the prose and sharpening the analysis, taking account of new scholarship, and offering new perspectives. As in previous editions, the roles that women and minority groups have played in the nation's development merit particular attention. These people appear not as passive witnesses to the historical narrative but as active participants in its evolution. New and expanded material throughout the chapters includes the following:<br />* Chapter 1, expanded coverage of Native Americans before encounter with Europeans.<br />* Chapter 6, new opening vignette highlighting the search for balance between public morality and private freedom in the new republic; additional coverage of political and social reform.<br />* Chapter 9, expanded discussion of treaties negotiated with Great Britain following the War of 1812.<br />* Chapter 11, revised and reorganized to enhance and emphasize coverage of the lives and lifestyles of slaves and their experience of slavery.<br />* Chapter 12, expanded discussion of black abolitionists and women's rights reformers.<br />* Chapter 16, restructured and revised to devote greater attention to lives of former slaves during Reconstruction; includes new sections on Black Codes and Jim Crow laws.<br />* Chapter 17, new opening vignette exploring a Native American's experience of conquest and exploitation of the American West.<br />* Chapter 26, new opening vignette highlighting personal experiences of hardship during the Great Depression; revised discussion of the stock market crash of 1929.<br />* Chapter 30, expanded discussion of the student protest movement of the 1960s.<br />* Chapter 31, shifts in the labor movement in the 1970s, including the rise of public employee unions; the changing American family at the turn of the century.<br />Chapter 33, revised and restructured to concentrate on the shifting economy of the 1990s to the present and the role of government policy in shaping American economy; updated with new discussion of foreign policy and homeland defense post-September 11, including new sections on the war on terrorism and war in Iraq.<br />FORMAT AND FEATURES<br />The more spacious page design of America Past and Present, Brief Sixth Edition, allows for larger maps and figures as well as the addition of marginal definitions of key terms in each chapter.<br />America Past and Present, Brief Sixth Edition, includes eight essays entitled &quot;We Americans,&quot; each focusing on some aspect of diversity or multiculturalism in America.

The topics in the present book are rather different. For example, automorphism groups of automata and the partially ordered sets of automata are systematically discussed. Moreover, some operations on languages and special classes of regular languages associated with deterministic and nondeterministic directable automata are dealt with. The book is self-contained and hence does not require any knowledge of automata and formal languages.<br />The theory of formal languages began with the classification of languages by N. Chomsky in Syntactic Structures in 1957. Now, this classification is called the Chomsky hierarchy of languages. On the other hand, the theory of automata was initiated by M.O. Rabin and D. Scott in 1959. Their work can be regarded as the most important first step in the theory of automata in spite of its simplicity. Since then, these two fields have been developed by many researchers as the two most important theoretical foundations of computer science.<br />In this book, the author mainly handles formal languages and automata from the algebraic point of view. In the first two chapters, Ito investigates the algebraic structure of automata and then he deals with a kind of global theory, that is, partially ordered sets of automata. In the following four chapters, he studies grammars, languages and operations on languages. In the last section, ito introduces special kinds of automata, i.e. directable automata. The subjects in the book seem to be unique compared to other books with similar titles. The contents of the book are based on the author's work which started in the mid 1970s. His work offers some alternative ways to conceptualize ideas in Wolfram's New Kind of Science.<br />This book consists of 9 chapters:<br />* In Chapter 1, Ito mainly deals with the automorphism groups of strongly connected automata and (n, G)-automata, that is representations of strongly connected automata.<br />* In Chapter 2, he generalizes the results in Chapter 1 to the class of general automata.<br />* In Chapter 3, he considers partially ordered sets of automata where partial orders are induced by homomorphisms of automata.<br />* In Chapter 4, he deals with the compositions and decompositions of regular languages under n-insertion and shuffle operations. Moreover, Ito considers a decidability problem with respect to the shuffle closures of regular commutative languages.<br />* In Chapter 5, he determines the structure of a shuffle closed language.<br />* In Chapter 6, insertion and deletion operations is treated in details.<br />* In Chapter 7, shuffle and scattered deletion operations is dealt with.<br />* In Chapter 8, first Ito provides the concept of directable automata and then the deals with nondeterministic directable automata.Chapter 1, Ito mainly deals with the automorphism groups of strongly connected automata and (n, G)-automata, that is representations of strongly connected automata.<BR>* In Chapter 2, he generalizes the results in Chapter 1 to the class of general automata.<BR>* In Chapter 3, he considers partially ordered sets of automata where partial orders are induced by homomorphisms of automata.<BR>* In Chapter 4, he deals with the compositions and decompositions of regular languages under n-insertion and shuffle operations.

Flaherty (Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol 27: Analytic Press) Much of this volume of Adolescent Psychiatry focuses on trauma and violence. These are not new issues to psychiatrists, especially those who work with adolescents. Indeed, they are hardly new issues for the world. What is new is a growing awareness of the psychological, biological, and social impact of trauma on its victims, especially on the young. What awaits is the translation of this new knowledge into public policy, so that the effects of trauma can be mitigated and, ultimately, so that children and adolescents can be protected from harm.<br />The two Schonfeld Award papers in this volume deal with violence. Michael Kalogerakis has devoted much of his career to developing programs for violent youth in New York, where he served as Commissioner of Mental Health. He reviews the history of the pendulum swings in juvenile justice, revealing how far we have come from the original aims of the juvenile court. At the same time, the link between trauma and violence in adolescence is now firmly established, and there are programs that have good data for their effectiveness. My paper on terrorism attempts to show the appeal of ideologies that espouse violent revolution to young people.<br />Christopher Thomas et al. present a study from their groundbreaking work on youth violence in Galveston, Texas. The study links gang membership with serious violent crime, and by demonstrating the importance of the peer group, it points to ways that youth can be socialized away from gang membership.<br />The federal regulations on seclusion and restraint in inpatient settings that went into effect in 2001 were greeted with much apprehension. The study by Theodore Petti et al. shows that effective interventions can reduce the use of seclusion and restraint even with the most difficult state hospital adolescent populations. Most crucial to their findings is the importance of staff support.<br />Mani Pavuluri and colleagues present a comprehensive review of what we know about early-onset schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.<br />They discuss differential diagnosis and treatment strategies, with emphasis on newer pharmacological agents.<br />A series of papers by the Committee on Adolescence of the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry deals with the nature, scope, and impact of trauma as well as implications of what we know for training and public policy. Freud's early discovery that histories of psychic trauma were prevalent among his patients-later put aside as he developed his theory of unconscious conflict-has been rediscovered as we have become aware of the appalling prevalence of child abuse and its lasting impact on its victims. Epidemiological studies have shown that traumatic stress is so prevalent in many societies and in subcultures of our own society that it can almost be considered a normative part of growing up. In areas as disparate as the inner cities of the United States and war-torn countries throughout the world, adolescents are traumatized by man-made violence. Natural disasters and disasters caused by human negligence take their toll everywhere.<br />Thanks to developments in neurobiology, we now have compelling evidence that this impact is in part mediated by measurable changes in brain function, as Patricia Lester et al. discuss in their paper on neurobiology and trauma. Cultural and gender issues are equally important in understanding the impact of trauma, as Warren Gadpaille demonstrates. These new awarenesses are being translated into clinical practice, as Monica Green's paper on intervention discusses. Finally, in this section, Max Sugar looks at the vulnerability of a particular group-late adolescents-to combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder, linking their vulnerability to developmental features of this period. His findings have particular significance for public policy, as late adolescents and young adults make up most of the frontline troops in combat.<br />Saul Levine dissects a multitude of self-deceptions and myths that he sees as having infected the mental health professions. Some of these involve beliefs (or purported beliefs) on the part of policymakers and funding agencies, others have been accepted uncritically by professionals themselves. All, in his view, have led to neglect of appropriate therapeutic care for adolescents.<br />James Gilfoil discusses the importance of families' attitudes toward psychotherapy in the outcome of therapy with teenagers. His paper includes a series of illustrations that constitute clinical pearls for the adolescent psychiatrist.<br />The final section consists of a resource paper on youth violence written by Charles Huffine, chair of the ASAP Topical Studies Council. This paper, which discusses the contributions of societal attitudes about youth to the perpetuation of violence and lack of appropriate interventions, was adopted as an official American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry (ASAP) position paper.ung adults make up most of the frontline troops in combat.<BR>Saul Levine dissects a multitude of self-deceptions and myths that he sees as having infected the mental health professions.

US	52886341	R36F9YK6YNJXHE	0415310016	956988373	Knot Theory	Books	5	11	19	N	N	Best of Knots	Knot Theory by Vassily Manturov (CRC Press) The aim of the present monograph is to describe the main concepts of modern knot theory together with full proofs that would be both accessible to beginners and useful for professionals. Thus, in the first chapter of the second part of the book (concerning braids) we start from the very beginning and in the same chapter construct the Jones two-variable polynomial and the faithful representation of the braid groups. A large part of the present title is devoted to rapidly developing areas of modern knot theory, such as virtual knot theory and Legendrian knot theory.<br />In the present book, we give both the &quot;old&quot; theory of knots, such as the fundamental group, Alexander's polynomials, the results of Dehn, Seifert, Burau, and Artin, and the newest investigations in this field due to Conway, Matveev, Jones, Kauffman, Vassiliev, Kontsevich, Bar-Natan and Birman. We also include the most significant results from braid theory, such as the full proof of Markov's theorem, Alexander's and Vogel's algorithms, Dehornoy algorithm for braid recognition, etc. We also describe various representations of braid groups, e.g., the famous Burau representation and the newest (1999-2000) faithful Krammer-Bigelow representation. Furthermore, we give a description of braid groups in different spaces and simple newest recognition algorithms for these groups. We also describe the construction of the Jones two-variable polynomial.<br />In addition, we pay attention to the theory of coding of knots by d-diagrams, described in the author's papers. Also, we give an introduction to virtual knot theory, proposed recently by Louis H. Kauffman. A great part of the book is devoted to the author's results in the theory of virtual knots.<br />Proofs of theorems involve some constructions from other theories, which have their own interest, i.e., quandle, product integral, Hecke algebras, connection theory and the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, Hopf algebras and quantum groups, Yang-Baxter equations, LD-systems, etc.<br />The contents of the book are not covered by existing monographs on knot theory; the present book has been taken a much of the author's Russian lecture notes book on the subject. The latter describes the lecture course that has been delivered by the author since 1999 for undergraduate students, graduate students, and professors of the Moscow State University.<br />The present monograph contains many new subjects (classical and modern), which are not represented in the author's earlier Russian version of this book.<br />While describing the skein polynomials we have added the Przytycky-Traczyk approach and Conway algebra. We have also added the complete knot invariant, the distributive grouppoid, also known as a quandle, and its generalisation. We have rewritten the virtual knot and link theory chapter. We have added some recent author's achievements on knots, braids, and virtual braids. We also describe the Khovanov categorification of the Jones polynomial, the Jones two-variable polynomial via Hecke algebras, the Krammer-Bigelow representation, etc.<br />The book is divided into thematic parts. The first part describes the state of &quot;pre-Vassiliev&quot; knot theory. It contains the simplest invariants and tricks with knots and braids, the fundamental group, the knot quandle, known skein polynomials, Kauffman's two-variable polynomial, some pretty properties of the Jones polynomial together with the famous Kauffman-Murasugi theorem and a knot table.<br />The second part discusses braid theory, including Alexander's and Vogel's algorithms, Dehornoy's algorithm, Markov's theorem, Yang-Baxter equations, Burau representation and the faithful Krammer-Bigelow representation. In addition, braids in different spaces are described, and simple word recognition algorithms for these groups are presented. We would like to point out that the first chapter of the second part (Chapter 8) is central to this part. This gives a representation of the braid theory in total: from various definitions of the braid group to the milestones in modern knot and braid theory, such as the Jones polynomial constructed via Hecke algebras and the faithfulness of the Krammer-Bigelow representation.<br />The third part is devoted to the Vassiliev knot invariants. We give all definitions, prove that Vassiliev invariants are stronger than all polynomial invariants, study structures of the chord diagram and Feynman diagram algebras, and finally present the full proof of the invariance for Kontsevich's integral. Here we also present a sketchy introduction to Bar-Natan's theory on Lie algebra representations and knots. We also give estimates of the dimension growth for the chord diagram algebra.<br />In the fourth part we describe a new way for encoding knots by d-diagrams proposed by the author. This way allows us to encode topological objects (such as knot, links, and chord diagrams) by words in a finite alphabet. Some applications of d-diagrams (the author's proof of the Kauffman-Murasugi theorem, chord diagram realisability recognition, etc.) are also described.<br />The fifth part contains virtual knot theory together with &quot;virtualisations&quot; of knot invariants. We describe Kauffman's results (basic definitions, foundation of the theory, Jones and Kauffman polynomials, quandles, finite-type invariants), and the work of Vershinin (virtual braids and their representation). We also included our own results concerning new invariants of virtual knots: those coming from the &quot;virtual quandle&quot;, matrix formulae and invariant polynomials in one and several variables, generalisation of the Jones polynomials via curves in 2-surfaces, &quot;long virtual link&quot; invariants, and virtual braids.<br />The final part gives a sketchy introduction to two theories: knots in 3-manifolds (e.g., knots in RP3 with Drobotukhina's generalisation of the Jones polynomial), the introduction to Kirby's calculus and Witten's theory, and Legendrian knots and links after Fuchs and Tabachnikov. We recommend the newest book on 3-manifolds by Matveev.<br />At the end of the book, a list of unsolved problems in knot and link theory and the knot table are given.<br />The description of the mathematical material is sufficiently closed; the mono-graph is quite accessible for undergraduate students of younger courses, thus it can be used as a course book on knots. The book can also be useful for professionals because it contains the newest and the most significant scientific developments in knot theory. Some technical details of proofs, which are not used in the sequel, are either omitted or printed in small type.es a representation of the braid theory in total: from various definitions of the braid group to the milestones in modern knot and braid theory, such as the Jones polynomial constructed via Hecke algebras and the faithfulness of the Krammer-Bigelow representation.<BR>The third part is devoted to the Vassiliev knot invariants.

It is based on a unique corpus of more than 20 hours of private conversations between partners in bilingual marriages. Adding to its breadth of coverage, these private conversations are supplemented with larger public discourses about international couplehood. The volume thus offers a corpus-driven investigation of the ways in which ideologies of gender, nationality and immigration mediate linguistic performances in private cross-cultural communication. The author embraces social-constructionist, feminist and postmodern approaches to second language learning, multilingualism and cross-cultural communication. In contrast to other titles in the field which have focused almost exclusively on the socialization of bilingual children, this book explores what it means to one's sense of self to become socialized into a second language and culture as a late bilingual.<br />The conceptual framework for this study informs the data collection and analysis. It also informs the data collection in that Piller attempts to arrange a diverse corpus that would incorporate data from both written and spoken genres, as well as public and private genres. The decision to collect a diverse corpus is based upon the premise that language ideologies mediate language use. It inform Piller's data analysis in exploring how discourses are played out in discourses. Specifically, Piller is concerned with the ways in which linguistic and national border-crossers through marriage perceive and perform their identities. Piller asks which identities do they do in which ways and how do they juggle contradictory facets of their identities? How do they enact their couple identities in their conversations? What are their hopes and plans for the identities of their children? Which beliefs enable or constrain their language choices and bilingualism, as well as that of their families? How are conflicting ideologies played out in private conversations?<br />This book is divided into two broad sections. The first one, which comprises Chapters 2-4, deals with data collection and introduces the participants. The second one, which comprises Chapters 5-9, describes the findings of the research.<br />Chapter 2 lays the groundwork for the research by reviewing research into linguistic intermarriage and the findings of this research. It is the purpose of Chapter 2 to present a comprehensive state-of-the art report of research into the linguistic practices of bilingual and cross-cultural couples. Where appropriate, Piller also refers to the literature on monolingual marital communication. Chapter 3 documents the conduct and engagement of the empirical linguistic research this work is founded upon and it describes the corpus. It details the process of data collection and the challenges Piller encountered in collecting &quot;couple talk.&quot; These challenges include the pervasive private-public boundary. The initial failure to collect &quot;authentic&quot; bilingual couple talk led me to re-conceptualize the very notion of &quot;private conversation?' The reliance upon a diverse corpus is also justified by the polyphonic stance adopted in this re-search. Chapter 4 provides brief biographies of the 36 couples whose conversations constitute Piller's core data. The chapter provides a sense of &quot;the real people&quot; behind the data, which, for the sake of the description of patterns and the continuity of the argument cannot be offered in the chapters of the second section.<br />Chapter 5 describes the linguistic backgrounds of the participants. It is concerned with their mother-tongue claims, as well as their self-assessments of their L2 proficiency. The ways in which mother-tongue claims and L2 proficiency assessment are mediated by ideologies of language ownership and success in language learning are of particular concern. Chapter 6 then goes on to describe how the participants deploy their linguistic resources in their language choices, both in the couple domain as well as in their extended families and their public lives. The chapter is particularly concerned with an ideology that pervades the research literature on linguistic intermarriage, namely the be-lief that bilingual couples will most often choose the majority language as their common language. Chapter 7 analyzes how the couples position themselves vis-&agrave;-vis two powerful - and contradictory - beliefs: an ideology of unity and similarity in the family, and an ideology of national difference. The chapter asks which discursive strategies the couples employ to reconcile those contradictory ideologies and how they perform their common couple identity. Chapter 8 is also concerned with the linguistic performance of couple identity. However, it moves away from discourse strategies to conversational styles. In particular, it explores the participants' descriptions of their private languages and de-scribes one particular feature of their conversational styles, the collaborative floor. The collaborative floor in bilingual conversation is quite different from the collaborative floor in monolingual conversations and, consequently, Piller specifically focuses on the bilingual characteristics of the collaborative floor in the conversations.<br />Chapter 9 is devoted to the couples' language planning activities and language transmission across generations. Simultaneous bilingual acquisition is a traditionally strong concern for bilingualism research. Chapter 9 differs from this work in that it is concerned with the parents' perspectives rather than the children's acquisition. The participants are all highly committed to their children's bilingualism and the chapter explores the reasons, educational practices and outcomes associated with that commitment. Chapter 9 continues the theme of Chapters 7 and 8, namely the constitution of private discourse in multiple public discourses. However, it also resumes the topic of language choice addressed in Chapter 6. While the focus of Chapter 6 is on language choice in the partnership domain, Chapter 9 addresses questions of intergenerational transmission.<br />Finally, Chapter 10 concludes the volume by tying the case study of English- and German-speaking couplehood in with the larger concerns that motivated this research. Specifically, these relate to the interrelationship between intermarriage and language choice, the negotiation of identity in a language contact situation, and the interrelationship between private talk and public discourses.y assessment are mediated by ideologies of language ownership and success in language learning are of particular concern.

To accomplish this, of course, a great deal of disciplinary inertia would have to be overcome. Images, Le Doeuff correctly observes, are considered by most professional philosophers to be extrinsic to the real theoretical labor of a philosopher's writings. To dwell upon them is much like focusing on the wrap-ping of the gift of truth that the philosopher is supposed to give. Nietzsche's image-album is so extensive and so vivid that it has hardly gone unnoticed. Indeed, it might be said that it is precisely because Nietzsche's works are laden with images that there was, and perhaps continues to be, such reluctance to recognize his work as philosophy rather than literature. Le Doeuff's work endeavors to show that images are not only rhetorically interesting but that, despite various philosophers' protests to the contrary, such images play an essential role in the properly philosophic development of ideas (i.e., aside from questionable persuasive functions, such as slipping in unjustified claims and asserting dogmatic positions). Risking what Derrida calls &quot;the troubling stakes of a philosophical bestiary, of a bestiary at the origin of philosophy,&quot; our intention in this volume is to display object lessons in support of Le Doeuff's gambit as it applies to Nietzsche' One of the project's motivations, then, is to enable an appreciation for the philosophic purposes of Nietzsche's metaphorical expression by focusing on this particular and prominent set of terms, perhaps illuminating paths for others to follow.<br />Another motivation for this project was our desire to intervene in con-temporary discussions on the traditional concept of &quot;human nature&quot; and in the emerging field of &quot;animal studies.&quot; Research in the life sciences by figures as diverse as Frans de Waal, Steven Pinker, and Donna Haraway have given new currency to old debates regarding the definition of humanity as such. Controversies of an earlier generation over the political ramifications of sociobiology have morphed into philosophic disputes about the ontological import of primate ethology, evolutionary psychology, and cyborg biotechnology.' In addition, as walls of anthropocentrism are deconstructed, a multidisciplinary movement across the domains of science and &quot;the humanities&quot; is busily forming to reconsider the nature of nonhuman lives and cross-species encounters.' In the context of these explorations, we believe, an investigation of Nietzsche's &quot;animal imaginary&quot; can serve to illuminate historical developments of zoological constructs of other animals as well as self-conceptions of human animality.'<br />Following the keynote chapter that provides a thematic entryway into the topos of Nietzschean animality, the main body of the book is divided into five parts. The first one, &quot;On `Lowly' Origins,&quot; is populated by animals that are given a low priority both in cultural currency at large and, at least superficially, in Nietzsche's own philosophic imaginary. The characteristics of these animals are typically associated with what is base and brutish in animality generally, with what humans pride themselves on having overcome. Each of the chapters in this division addresses Nietzsche's ambivalence toward these creatures and shows how they offer resources for what Nietzsche envisions as necessary to the future development of humanity as such. The second part, &quot;Zarathustra's Animals,&quot; continues to develop the issues explicitly raised in the preceding part and ties them to prominent concerns in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, including the ideas of eternal recurrence and the overcoming of morality and humanity. The third part focuses on the most infamous creature in Nietzsche's bestiary, namely, the beast of prey, who is also associated with the blond beast, black beast, and lion. The three contributions to this division work together to trace Nietzsche's sources for this animal, its relation to creativity and violence, and the role it plays in his conception of the human animal. Various forms of human animality, including deficient and enigmatic forms, hybrids, and possible future forms are the subjects of the fourth division, &quot;Human Animals.&quot; In these chapters, the authors consider the ways in which their subjects are figured as animals in order to devise a diagnostic tool or measure of the fitness of the human in relation to other animals. Nietzsche's goal in these cases is to develop therapies that would enable a more vibrant possibility for the human animal's future. The fifth and final part focuses upon Nietzsche's conception of himself as animal. These chapters reveal how Nietzsche thinks of his own &quot;inner animal&quot; and how he conceives the enterprise of philosophizing as drawing upon and cultivating various animal energies to appropriate different animal &quot;styles.&quot; Finally, we conclude the volume with a set of reflections on Nietzsche's philosophic use of metaphor, focusing on the metamorphoses effected in his accounts of animal parts-paws, claws, and jaws-for the purposes of both imagining and instigating the transformation of human physis. This after-word is followed by materials that we expect to be especially useful to those who wish to pursue the themes of the volume, including a brief discussion of source materials for Nietzsche's famous account of the metamorphosis in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, a bibliographic essay that explores how Nietzsche's conception of animality is developed in the work of philosophers following Nietzsche, and an index of animal references in Nietzsche's works.

Nickelsburg (The Bible and its modern interpreters: Scholars Press) This volume documents the major developments in the study of &quot;early Judaism&quot; (ca. 330 B.C.E. to ca. 138 C.E.) from about the mid-1940s. Because this field of investigation is not as clearly defined or as well established as the areas covered in the other volumes of this trilogy (Hebrew Bible and New Testament), we have included a lengthy introduction that discusses the field itself and current interest in it, new tools and approaches, major topics and problems, and the types of study we feel are needed in the future. The introductory essay was drafted primarily by George Nickelsburg and edited into its current form by Robert Kraft.<br />The bulk of the volume is organized into three major sections. The first deals with &quot;synthetic approaches&quot; to the political, social, and religious history of the period. The original plan was to include in this opening section a major essay on problems of definition, with a focus on Judaism as religion, but that was abandoned and comments on these issues are now included in the introduction. Part 2 focuses on the recent discoveries that have stimulated and enriched the renewed study of early Judaism, from the Dead Sea documents and other written materials to archaeological and numismatic data of relevance. As the introduction points out, the sheer bulk of new materials renders many aspects of the older synthetic treatments obsolete and justifies the need for careful descriptive analysis at various levels before comprehensive new syntheses are attempted. Part 3 surveys work on the literature of early Judaism organized according to different types (form and/or content) of material. The concern here is primarily with the Jewish apocrypha and pseudepigrapha and the writings of Philo and Josephus, although some attention is also given to literary aspects of the Qumran scrolls (which are treated as such in chapter 5). The final chapter of the third part differs somewhat from the earlier ones in that it addresses the question of how the Jewish rabbinic materials, which mostly postdate the chronological limits that we have set for early Judaism, have been used or can be used responsibly in the study of early Judaism. The chapter that had been planned to begin this part, on the languages used by Jews in the Greco-Roman world, had to be omitted (see the general comments in the introduction).(which are treated as such in chapter 5).

Such global events can be reconstructed with the help of reliefs, sediments and palaeosoils and their specific morphological, chemical and mineralogical properties. Desert margins represent inter-sections between arid and humid ecosystems. Their geographical position will react very sensitively on climatic changes. The broad regions of transformation between recent humid ecosystems and the fully arid deserts are the proper areas where palaeoclimatically different phases will be remarkably recognized and interpreted.<br />Aeolian sediments, e.g. dunes, can be used as palaeoclimatic indicators: palaeodunes in todays more humid climate may indicate arid conditions at the time of their deposition. As an example, fossil dunes are widely distributed in the Sahel south of the Sahara. In resting periods of sedimentation a cover of vegetation appears, and chemical weathering processes and hence soil formation takes place on the sediments in humid climates (see Felix-Henningsen, Heine, R&ouml;gner et al., Smykatz-Kloss et al.). In deeper positions of the relief fluvial sediments in wadis and limnic sediments in palaeolakes and playas were deposited. They can be recognized by their sedimentary structures and by characteristic mineral associations, such as for example transformed evaporites (see R&ouml;gner et al., Schutt, Heine), by diatomites and lacustrine sediments (see Baumhauer et al.) or by bog ores (see Felix-Henningsen). At some rare occasions the coastline of a former lake is traced by fulgurites (see Sponholz). The organogenic components of soils and sediments mirror the palaeoecological conditions and changes (see Smykatz-Kloss et al.). The pollen communities in upper soils and sediments show the spectrum of the vegetation and thus deliver important criteria for palaeoclimates and relative ages (see Baumhauer et al.). Anthropogenic relicts in soils and sediments are a proof for humid phases. The existence of humid phases and their relative occurrences in the stratigraphical context and the kinds of sediments and palaeosoils allow the re-construction of the frequency, relative age and character of palaeoclimatic changes (see R&ouml;gner et al., Mischke et al.). Absolute dating of aeolian sediments by using luminescence methods such al TL or OSL (see J&auml;kel, Smykatz-Kloss et al.) and organic substances (14C) - where present - indicate the age position. If the sets of data are sufficiently dense, a picture can be obtained about the time periods of the humid and arid climate phases (Eitel et al., R&ouml;gner et al., Smykatz-Kloss et al.).<br />The signals of arid periods can partly be discovered widely distributed, e.g. over the desert margins to off-shore regions in the oceans. Thus, Leuschner, Sirocko et al. describe layers of (aeolian) dust from Saudi-Arabia in drilling profiles of the Arabian Sea: the geochemical and sedimentological evaluation of these palaeo-loesses in the marine sediment cores contributes to the reconstruction of palaeo-monsoon movements (Leuschner et al.).<br />Questions on the palaeo-ecological interpretation of drylands and desert mar-gins are explored in the German working group &quot;desert margins&quot; and in many interdisciplinary projects. The group conferences are held annually in January at the Rauischholzhausen castle near Gie&szlig;en. This working group, which has also acted as the German representation for several international geological correlation programmes (all concerned with desert research: IGCP 250, 349, 410), was established seven years ago by the editors of this volume. It is made up of approximately 50 geoscientists of (nearly) all disciplines: geomorphologists, geologists, mineralogists, geochemists, soil scientists, geochronologists, sedimentologists - as well as several palynologists, geobotanists and archaeologists.<br />At the beginning a pilot project built the core of the research (group) comprising nine projects from the edges of the Sahara (Reichelt, Baumhauer et al., Felix-Henningsen, R&ouml;gner et al., Schulz et al., Smykatz-Kloss et al., Sponholz) and of the Namib (Eitel et al., Heine). After a while the study areas were extended to-wards the north-west (Spain: Schutt, G&uuml;nter) and - primarily - (north-) eastwards across the Arabic world (Leuschner, Sirocko et al.) towards Central Asia (Grunert &amp; Lehmkuhl; Mischke, Hofmann et al.; Walther). Methodical questions on age analysis (dating of young sediments and aridic soils) and the correlation between chemical weathering (geochemistry, soil science) and palaeoecology are the themes that raise the regional and subject specific results onto a global scale (J&auml;kel; Eitel, Bl&uuml;mel &amp; Huser; Felix-Henningsen; Heine; Leuschner, Sirocko et al.; R&ouml;gner et al.; Schutt; Smykatz-Kloss et al.).<br />The investigation of the desert margins as suitable indicators for global climatic fluctuations belongs to the basic research in palaeoecology. The obtained results contribute to the efforts of several earth scientific disciplines in order to under-stand and reconstruct the causes, frequencies and time periods of palaeoclimatological events and changes. This is especially important on the background of the recent global temperature increase, which is mainly anthropogenetically initiated, and of regional climatic catastrophes. The prognosis of long-term consequences on the base of modeling exhibits many uncertainties concerning the frequency, duration and amplitude of natural climatic fluctuations.<br />Additionally, the results of studies on desert margins enrich our knowledge on the complexities of landscape formation and on the distribution pattern of their re-sources (e.g. soils and groundwater) in dependence on extremely different climatic conditions and changes. Ecosystems of savannahs and semi-deserts in the regions of desert margins and the people living there are endangered in their existence by short- and long-term climatic fluctuations. The research data of the working group contribute to a more pronounced understanding of these ecosystems: not only the studied structures and processes, but their development in time, their formation and disappearance under the influence of global climatic changes have to be regarded. Geomorphological research in these climatic regions (e.g. the desert mar-gins) will only be effective if the various geo- and bioscientific disciplines will work together.

MacRae (Scholars Press) (Hardcover) This volume has been designed both to survey and to evaluate New Testament scholarship since World War II. In several respects this period of about forty years comprises one of several eras in NT studies that were extraordinarily productive both in quantity and quality of work and also in significance of results. Similarly productive periods surely are to be identified around 1835-1840, when David Friedrich Strauss stirred up a world-wide debate on the historical Jesus and when the priority of Mark seemed secure; or around 1865, when the basic Two-Source theory of Synoptic origins seemed assured and C. Tischendorf was discovering or publishing some of the most important NT manuscripts; or around 1900, when the impressive scholarship of Adolf Harnack and the other learned \\"Old Liberals\\" set the modern standard for excellence in critical scholarship and at the same time misled two generations on the kingdom of God and the historical Jesus, and when Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer effected a revolution in NT scholarship on the latter issues; or around 1920, when Karl Barth's Epistle to the Romans (1918) had appeared and when the stage was set by Martin Dibelius and Rudolf Bultmann for the form-critical analyses of the NT, but especially by Barth and Bultmann for new theological/ hermeneutical approaches that were to have far-reaching influence in the post-World War II period and down to our own times; or, finally, around the mid-1930s-just before the war - when Rudolf Otto and C. H. Dodd emphasized (and Dodd overemphasized) the reality of the present kingdom in the ministry of Jesus, and when the Chester Beatty papyri were published and brought new life to textual criticism.<br />Our forty-year period began in 1945 and the immediately following years with the reestablishment of those international scholarly ties that had been broken and had lain dormant during the war years when North America and virtually all of Europe were involved in conflict. Obviously, British-American ties were quickly and almost automatically restored, but perhaps most striking in this reconnection was the early and close cooperation of German and American NT scholars. This was symbolized, for instance, in the broad use of English-language publications in the work of European scholars like W. G. K&uuml;mmel and others, but was demonstrated very concretely, for example, in the interconnection between the German \\"Neutestamentlicher Arbeitskreis\\" and the American \\"New Testament Colloquium.\\" Prominent in the former group were scholars like Hans Conzelmann; the latter group emphasized \\"the study of issues raised by or resulting from the scholarly work of . . . Rudolf Bultmann\\" (as described in the<br />Encyclopedia of Associations, 10th ed.) and included among its senior members Hans Jonas, Kendrick Grobel, and Amos Wilder, as well as (then) younger members such as Robert W. Funk, Helmut Koester, George MacRae, Norman Perrin, James M. Robinson, and about a dozen others. Fully half of these members of the American group were either European by birth or had studied on the Continent. Renewed recognition and cooperation between those on both sides of the Atlantic were not limited, of course, to the German-American scene, but were worldwide, and no longer would any national group form an isolated \\"cell\\" of NT scholarship.<br />At the same time, due primarily to the encyclical of Pope Pius XII in 1943, Divino afflante spiritu, Roman Catholic NT scholars no longer traveled a separate path, but began to walk in the mainstream of critical scholarship (see Brown: 18-19, 117). This dramatic change can be seen, symbolically and in actuality, by observing in North America the extraordinary degree to which the memberships of the Society of Biblical Literature and of the Catholic Biblical Association now overlap-and also in recent years by the numerous Roman Catholic presidents of the former and the recent Protestant president of the latter. As a further instance, Joseph Fitzmyer, a Jesuit, has served as editor of both societies' journals, first of the Journal of Biblical Literature for six years (1971-1976) and then of the Catholic Biblical Quarterly (1980-1984). Examples could be multiplied, such as the appointment of Roman Catholic (and Jewish) NT scholars to permanent positions and endowed chairs in Protestant theological seminaries (and conversely), or the \\"denominationally blind\\" appointments now made in most of our college and university programs in the study of religion. These developments, which appear matter-of-fact to us now, could not have been foreseen or even imagined prior to World War II. Anyone who doubts this statement will find striking confirmation of its accuracy in a 1947 article in The Study of the Bible Today and Tomorrow-a collaborative volume similar to the present one-by J. H. Cobb on \\"Current Trends in Catholic Biblical Research,\\" where the \\"Catholic\\" and the \\"liberal\\" scholars are seen as radically different in their approaches and results:<br />The Catholic scholar, on the other hand, begins with Scripture and tradition, the total deposit of the faith as, and only as, this is officially interpreted by the living magisterium of the church.... He cannot doubt the reliability of the channels by which the biblical literature has been transmitted, nor can he consider portions of it as mere myth, legend, fiction, symbol, etiological explanation, or apologetic. He cannot employ one portion of it to disprove the factual character of another portion. To illustrate, when accounts of a given event, such as the resurrection narratives, differ widely in detail, he must harmonize the records in such a way as to affirm both the truth of the detail and the truthfulness of the total story of which it is a part. (117-18)<br />Raymond E. Brown, S.S., speaks for the current view on the relationship between the magisterium and the theologians or biblical scholars:<br />I do not think that the members of the magisterium can speak authoritatively about matters of theology or Scripture unless they have elementary competence in the field, either by their own learning or by consultation. . . . I am saying that bishops must listen to theologians and acquire information, and pray over it, and think over it, and then teach pastorally what they judge the Church must hear. (48-49)<br />To be more specific, he speaks, for instance, of the Catholic Church's \\"acceptance of a developmental approach to the Gospels, recognizing that the final Gospels go considerably beyond the ministry of Jesus and that later Christology had been retrojected into the accounts of the ministry\\" (67), and he cites as one example Matt 16:18: \\"Today, the majority of scholars would recognize that Mark is older than Matthew and that the sentence about building the Church upon Peter is a Matthean addition (from post-resurrectional material) to an account which originally lacked it, as we see in Mark and Luke\\". These somewhat random statements from Brown are symbolic of a fresh and refreshing ecumenical unity among NT scholars that is a distinctive feature of the postwar period.<br />Another refreshing change has been the steady decline of anti-Semitic expressions and anti-Jewish sentiments in NT scholarship, though the task has not been finally completed. As one example, the pejorative (and inaccurate) description of the Judaism of the general NT period as Sp&auml;tjudentum (\\"late Judaism\\") has in our time largely disappeared from our parlance. In addition, a new openness to face the issues of anti-Semitism within the NT - and to face them honestly-has been evident throughout the post World War II period, involving both Protestant and Catholic -and, of course, Jewish-participants in the continuing discussion and the growing literature.<br />Bultmann's brief but provocative essay, serves appropriately as the pivot between the prewar and postwar phases of NT scholar-ship, for not only does it bridge chronologically the gap created by the war, but it is symptomatic of widespread changes that were to take place when studies resumed on a broad scale. This is evident, as examples, in renewed investigations of the Christian kerygma and its meaning to moderns, in hermeneutics generally and in the application of existentialist categories to the NT in particular, in the study of NT language and \\"language-event\\" and the new literary-critical approaches to the NT, in the application of Greco-Roman religion and philosophy to the study of the NT, and in the so-called new quest of the historical Jesus. Indeed, when one takes into account the other aspects of Bultmann's work-form criticism and the sayings of Jesus, NT theology, and Pauline and Johannine studies-it is obvious how pivotal he and his work have been in our discipline. Even those who may eschew the \\"Bultmannian\\" or \\"post-Bultmannian\\" points of view will admit both his deep influence and the character of his work as a turning point in postwar NT studies.<br />This list of significant contributors, long as it is, represents only a small portion of the highly influential scholars who have shaped NT studies over the centuries. It does, however, bring us to the beginning of World War II, where the present volume again takes up the narrative of the ongoing development of NT studies.<br />It will be obvious that the essays that follow have at least two significant omissions, for there are neither separate chapters nor substantive discussions of either the social world of the NT or feminist perspectives on NT scholarship. Perhaps the editors were remiss in not assigning separate contributions on these subjects, but in the late 1970s, when this trilogy on The Bible and Its Modern Interpreters was planned, investigations of the NT social world were only beginning and a distinctive feminist perspective on NT studies was even less well articulated than were such perspectives on the study of religion generally, or on theology, or even on the OT-from which NT studies has so often taken its cue-for in that field also only a modicum of work had been done prior to the present decade. It will be the responsibility, therefore, of the next generation to assess NT scholarship in these two areas, for surely during the coming decades NT social world and anthropological studies will demonstrate their vital significance for interpreting the NT, and all along feminist perspectives will continue to correct the male-dominated biblical scholarship of the past eighteen centuries and more.and the theologians or biblical scholars:<BR>I do not think that the members of the magisterium can speak authoritatively about matters of theology or Scripture unless they have elementary competence in the field, either by their own learning or by consultation. . . .

In addition, a new openness to face the issues of anti-Semitism within the NT - and to face them honestly-has been evident throughout the post World War II period, involving both Protestant and Catholic -and, of course, Jewish-participants in the continuing discussion and the growing literature.<BR>Bultmann's brief but provocative essay, serves appropriately as the pivot between the prewar andpostwar phases of NT scholar-ship, for not only does it bridge chronologically the gap created by the war, but it is symptomatic of widespread changes that were to take place when studies resumed on a broad scale. This is evident, as examples, in renewed investigations of the Christian kerygma and its meaning to moderns, in hermeneutics generally and in the application of existentialist categories to the NT in particular, in the study of NT language and \\"language-event\\" and the new literary-critical approaches to the NT, in the application of Greco-Roman religion and philosophy to the study of the NT, and in the so-called new quest of the historical Jesus. Indeed, when one takes into account the other aspects of Bultmann's work-form criticism and the sayings of Jesus, NT theology, and Pauline and Johannine studies-it is obvious how pivotal he and his work have been in our discipline. Even those who may eschew the \\"Bultmannian\\" or \\"post-Bultmannian\\" points of view will admit both his deep influence and the character of his work as a turning point in postwar NT studies.<BR>This list of significant contributors, long as it is, represents only a small portion of the highly influential scholars who have shaped NT studies over the centuries. It does, however, bring us to the beginning of World War II, where the present volume again takes up the narrative of the ongoing development of NT studies.<BR>It will be obvious that the essays that follow have at least two significant omissions, for there are neither separate chapters nor substantive discussions of either the social world of the NT or feminist perspectives on NT scholarship. Perhaps the editors were remiss in not assigning separate contributions on these subjects, but in the late 1970s, when this trilogy on The Bible and Its Modern Interpreters was planned, investigations of the NT social world were only beginning and a distinctive feminist perspective on NT studies was even less well articulated than were such perspectives on the study of religion generally, or on theology, or even on the OT-from which NT studies has so often taken its cue-for in that field also only a modicum of work had been done prior to the present decade. It will be the responsibility, therefore, of the next generation to assess NT scholarship in these two areas, for surely during the coming decades NT social world and anthropological studies will demonstrate their vital significance for interpreting the NT, and all along feminist perspectives will continue to correct the male-dominated biblical scholarship of the past eighteen centuries and more.	2004-06-24

Greenstein, Theodore J. Lewis, David Marcus, Simon B. Parker (Society of Biblical Literature) (Paperback) The Ugaritic narrative poems all come from the ancient city of Ugarit, which lies half a mile inland from the Syrian coast opposite the eastern tip of Cyprus. The city was discovered after a farmer's accidental exposure of an ancient tomb nearby in 1928 and has been excavated almost annually since 1929. The excavators have uncovered a large palace; an acropolis with two temples, the house of the high priest, and the house of a divination priest; and numerous other large and small buildings, both sacred and secular. These all date from the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C.E. The levels from this period lie closest to the surface, have been most extensively excavated, and have yielded several archives and libraries. The uninscribed and inscribed remains together disclose many aspects of the city's culture during the Late Bronze Age.<br />Ugarit was well situated for trade. Trade routes extended by land east-ward to the other major cities of Syria, to Mitanni, and to Assyria; by sea westward to Cyprus and the Aegean; by land and by sea northward and westward to Asia Minor and the territory of the Hittites; and southward to Palestine and Egypt. Through economic and cultural contacts with these various regions, Ugarit became a rich and cosmopolitan city in the Late Bronze Age.<br />Excavators have found in the city the scripts and languages of several of the cultures with which it had relations. Two languages and scripts predominate, however. Akkadian, the language of the Assyrians and Babylonians, was the international language of the period and was used especially for communications between states, including Egypt. (Ugarit was predominantly under Egyptian influence in the first part of the Late Bronze Age but after ca. 1350 B.C.E. was dominated by the Hittite state to the north.) Akkadian was written in the complex cuneiform writing system, in which each of several hundred signs consisted of a cluster of wedge-shaped impressions on soft clay and represented a syllable, word, or indicator of a semantic category. But Ugarit also had its own native language, related to several Semitic languages, but generally classified as Northwest Semitic, reflecting its proximity to the hypothetical ancestor of the first-millennium languages of Syria-Palestine: Aramaic, Hebrew, Phoenician, and so on. To write this language, the scribes of Ugarit devised their own script. They exploited the alphabetic principle that had already inspired the invention of the Canaanite alphabet farther south, but devised signs using cuneiform impressions on clay, as for Akkadian. The Ugaritic alphabet consists of thirty simple cuneiform signs, each one representing a consonant (except for three which represent the same consonant -a glottal stop-with three different vowels). In this script the scribes of Ugarit wrote numerous internal administrative records of the city government, many letters and religious texts, and a few literary texts.<br />The Ugaritic texts include the only collection outside of the Bible of native poetry and narratives from pre-Roman Syria-Palestine. These narrative poems are of unique value as a source of information about Syro-Palestinian poetry, narrative, and mythology toward the end of the Bronze Age. As such, they also provide us with a sample of the traditional background of some of the poetic, narrative, and mythological material in the Hebrew Bible. We find in the Ugaritic narrative poems representatives of a developed poetic tradition that lies behind the poetic achievement now pre-served in the prophetic, liturgical, and wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible; versions of traditional tales or motifs that are later recast in Hebrew prose narratives; and a world of gods, with their conflicts and assemblies and interventions in human affairs, that is still dimly reflected in the surviving Hebrew literature.<br />The Ugaritic narratives are all apparently poetic; that is, they consistently use parallelism and/or poetic formulas. Parallelism, familiar from most biblical poetry, refers to the juxtaposition of phrases or clauses in usually two, sometimes three, and occasionally more, poetic cola of similar syntactic structure and/or semantic import. Poetic formulas include standard epithets for common characters, including gods; standard expressions for the introduction of direct speech, for a character's arrival at or departure from aplace, for the passage of time, and so on; and standard pairs of words or phrases used in parallel cola. Many formulas constitute a complete colon and even appear in pairs or larger clusters of cola. While a prose translation that did away with these features would offer a more fast-paced and engaging narrative to the modern reader, we have retained them in the interest of giving a sense of the traditional, poetic character of narratives that would have been not read silently but recited orally.<br />The first three narratives translated here, Kirta, Aqhat, and Baal-stories of a king, a patriarch, and the gods respectively-are recognizably literary works, whatever the social purposes they served. Several of the other, shorter narratives, however, appear to have some more immediate, practical use, as is suggested by references to ritual acts, prescriptions, or social circumstances in conjunction with which the narratives were recited. This suggests the immediate power of specific narratives in relation to specific situations.<br />The first three works are best known and have been translated several times. The other, shorter texts have in many cases not been included in the standard translations of Ugaritic texts, and the translations that are available sometimes exhibit the translator's creativity and imagination where a sound basis for determining the meaning of the original is lacking. The more fragmentary and obscure texts are included because of their obvious relations with those that are better preserved and understood and also because they have been used in some bold hypotheses concerning Ugaritic mythology and religion.he surviving Hebrew literature.<BR>The Ugaritic narratives are all apparently poetic; that is, they consistently use parallelism and/or poetic formulas.

Tzvi Abusch (Brown Judaic Studies) These essays resulted in the study of Mesopotamian magical and medical texts centering on witchcraft and sorcery. They address difficulties typology in the sorting of texts into coherent categories and to understand individual prayers and incantations. These studies focus on individual texts and suggest solutions to complications and intricacies in the material to aid in understanding of magical texts generally. Part One follows a diachronic approach, Part Two a synchronic one. In this sense, the studies are broad: while unraveling knots in individual texts, they highlight textual problems while exemplifing some solutions for common problems in traditional Mesopotamian therapeutic literature.<br />In Part One, Abusch examines such well known Akkadian incantations and prayers as KARL 226 IV 3ff. and related texts (Chapter 1), Mag1û VII 119-146 and related texts (Chapter 2), and KAR 26 and BMS 12 (Chapter 3). This examination grew out of various attempts to determine the limits of the witchcraft corpus and to categorize the many texts that display divergent and sometimes contradictory textual features. These texts contain indicators that suggest that they were used not only to combat witchcraft but also for other purposes as well. Such changes resulted in the appearance of disjointed and/or contradictory statements and of features pointing to multiple and often unrelated uses of the text. Accordingly, Abusch argues that a determination of the stages of development of such compositions is necessary for an understanding of the text and is one way to decide whether a text should be included in, or excluded from, the corpus.<br />Part Two focuses on an individual incantation, Maglû I 1-36, an address to the gods of the night sky. Although this opening incantation in Magli is a famous and oft-cited example of magical literature, Abusch's initial study of the text raised new questions and revealed unexplained details. He constructs a coherent and comprehensive statement of the meaning and function of the incantation. Accordingly, Abusch subjects this incantation to a detailed and sustained analysis. The painstaking examination of the individual elements of an incantation and of their relationship to each other is laborious, but at least in this case it resulted in a fuller understanding of the text and of its place in Maglaî. Moreover, this type of analysis showed the incantation to be the product of a literary creativity that draws together magical and legal imagery for the purpose of creating an indictment in which social and moral dimensions of the witchcraft accusation come into play.vealed unexplained details.

He begins by developing a solution to the problem of induction-a solution whose key idea is that the regularities in the workings of nature that have held in our experience hitherto are to he explained by appeal to the controlling influence of laws, as forms of natural necessity. His second line of argument focuses on the issue of what we should take such necessitational laws to be, and whether we can even make sense of them at all. Having considered and rejected various alternatives, Foster puts forward his own proposal: the obtaining of a law consists in the causal imposing of a regularity on the universe as a regularity. With this causal account of laws in place, he is now equipped to offer an argument for theism. His claim is that natural regularities call for explanation, and that, whatever explanatory role we may initially assign to laws, the only plausible ultimate explanation is in terms of the agency of God. Finally, he argues that, once we accept the existence of God, we need to think of him as creating the universe by a method which imposes regularities on it in the relevant law-yielding way. In this new perspective, the original nomological-explanatory solution to the problem of induction becomes a theological-explanatory solution.<br />The Divine Lawmaker is bold and original in its approach, and rich in argument. The issues on which it focuses are among the most important in the whole epistemological and metaphysical spectrum.<br />The Divine Lawmaker is a slightly revised version of a series of lectures that Foster gave at the University of Oxford under the title of `Induction, Laws of Nature, and the Existence of God'-a title that explicitly indicates the topics that form their subject matter.<br />Foster covers quite a lot of philosophical and theological ground. And, on the face of it, diverse ground. But there is a connection between the different topics. One of his main aims is to provide an argument for the existence of God-a personal God of a broadly  Jewish Christian type. Foster develops his arguments in four stages that include the topics of induction and laws of nature.<br />Foster begins by looking at the familiar problem of induction, claiming that certain ways of attempting to solve it do not work. The idea of induction occupies the first two lectures. Next-at stage two- Foster introduces and defends what he asserts is, in its core, the right solution to the problem of induction. It is a solution that the Australian philosopher David Armstrong has also proposed independently at virtually the same time-Armstrong presenting it in his 1983 book What is a Law of Nature?, Foster in his 1983 paper to the Aristotelian Society entitled `Induction, Explanation, and Natural Necessity'. Armstrong and Foster are at opposite ends of the metaphysical spectrum. Armstrong is the foremost modern champion of total materialism. Foster is one of the few modern defenders of a Cartesian conception of the mind; and, more exotically, Foster combines this mind-body dualism with an idealist view of the physical world (though claim is not developed in the context of this book). Both Armstrong and Foster find it amusing, and in a sense reassuring, that, with such contrasting metaphysical outlooks, they manage to converge on the same view in this understanding of induction and natural law.<br />Now this proposed solution to the problem of induction involves accepting the existence of laws of nature, and it involves recognizing these laws not just<br />as regularities in the behavior of things (consistencies in how the world works in different places and times), but as forms of natural necessity-as laws whose obtaining ensures that things behaveand interact in certain regular ways. It is this that brings the discussion to its third stage in Foster's argument. Foster demonstrates that accepting the existence of laws of this kind, though facilitating a solution to the problem of induction, creates its own problem. The problem it creates is simply that, given the kind of necessity these laws involve, it is hard to see how to make sense of such laws-how the relevant notion of a law can be considered coherent.<br />It is in relation to this new problem that, in the fourth and final phase of the discussion, Foster constructs an argument for the existence of God. For he argues that, given the problem of unintelligibility or lack of coherence, one can only achieve a satisfactory account of the of the coherence of laws if we entertain that there is a God of the relevant (broadly Jewish and Christian) type, and that it is God who is the creator of the natural world and the source of its laws. With the argument for theism in place, Foster concludes the discussion by looking again at the issue of induction, and showing how his earlier proposal needs to be reworked, in certain key respects, in response to the theistic necessity of holding moral and natural law. Foster's arguments, if one is able to follow them, may bolster faith and might seems irrelevant to those with nonthestic neutrality.ct in certain regular ways.

Excerpt: To summarize my story therefore: The greatest long-term risks facing humanity will not come from such apocalyptic threats as terrible weapons of mass destruction, prolonged global war, devastating disease or famine, or extinction by a huge wayward meteor. Rather they will come from the debilitating attrition caused by the rising tides of bureaucracy and control. These trends are steadily strangling human ingenuity and undermining our very ability to cope.<br />The good news is that we can do something about these problems, and in principle, they should not be too difficult to solve. However, deeply entrenched attitudes can be a formidable barrier. Our major problem is that at the margin where greatness lies bureaucracy is strangling scientific creativity. Everything we value came out of the blue, out of the greatness of pioneering scientists and engineers. Such scientists as the Einsteins, driven solely by their restless spirits of enquiry, laid the foundations for a vast series of such unforeseen developments as the transistor and integrated circuitry, nuclear power, lasers and optoelectronics, and computers that today dominate everyday life. It is difficult to imagine life without them. Their work was not encouraged or stimulated. Revolutionary discoveries once emerged in the natural course of things. Human ingenuity does not need stimulating; we merely have to ensure that it is not being routinely suppressed. That vital condition was broadly satisfied from about the Renaissance until the 1970s, when the current obsessions with optimization and efficiency began. Our most urgent need, therefore, is to make the modest changes that will allow it to be satisfied once again.	2004-06-23

It has to be said that these practices constitute a normative component of science, if only because one broad and obvious sense of \\"norm\\" applies whenever practices of any sort provide any sort of guidance.<br />Jonathan Knowles, as I read him, has no problem with any of this, despite the perhaps overly dramatic subtitle of his new book Norms, Naturalism and Epistemology: The Case for Science without Norms. (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003) His phrase \\"science without norms\\" (which he refers to as a slogan) is not meant to be taken as strictly literal or exceptionless. (See page 145, for example.) Knowles is making the case, not for the silly view that science has no normative practices, but for a naturalistic reconception of epistemology and the philosophy of science, one which jettisons the traditional notion of norms as comprising an a priori philosophical foundation for science that is separate from scientific theory itself.<br />Anyone familiar with the work of the late and revered philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine will recognize that just such a reconception of epistemology and the philosophy of science is a project that Quine was engaged in. Indeed, the seminal essay for this was his \\"Epistemology Naturalized.\\" In a nutshell, a \\"naturalized\\" epistemology of science would be one that justifies scientific theory using only the resources of natural science itself. Others, most notably Nelson Goodman and Thomas Kuhn, can be read as sharing in this project, as well. The particular contribution Knowles makes is in terms of exploring the abandonment of the philosophical pretension of separate norms, and the implications of naturalism for the deflation of philosophical pretensions somewhat more generally.<br />For this, he draws upon Quine, Goodman and Kuhn, as well as upon others, including Hilary Kornbluth, Larry Laudan and Edward Stein. While at times critical of the views of these philosophers, he clearly rides the wave of the overall project of naturalizing epistemology.<br />Nevertheless, he rejects the pretensions of naturalized epistemology to provide better answers to at least some of the questions of traditional epistemology. Questions about the norms of science, as those questions have traditionally been conceived in epistemology and the philosophy of science, are to be rejected, on his view. Rather than seeking to provide better answers to these questions, the outcome of naturalism for Knowles is to dissolve the questions in Wittgensteinian fashion.<br />This book is likely to be of interest to, and useful for, those familiar with the analytic tradition of naturalized epistemology and concerned about the relationships, at the most abstract level, between substantive scientific theory and the practices which guide the revision and development of science. Like other work related to the grand project of naturalism, it presents an intriguing view of the scientist as fundamentally autonomous. What is perhaps most distinctive here is the extent to which Knowles believes this epistemological independence goes. The scientist, according to Knowles, is in no need of aid from the philosopher or anyone else in the legitimating of scientific practice.rnbluth, Larry Laudan and Edward Stein.

Arpey (Syracuse University Press) Antebellum culture is compellingly exposed in this book of horrific multiple murder and madness in Upstate New York. Andrew W. Arpey offers insight into a wide variety of subjects that will have broad appeal to historians and scholars of law, journalism, religion, psychiatry, politics, and race and reform.<br />In 1846 William Freeman, a young man of African and Native American descent, stabbed to death four members of the Van Nest family with no apparent motive. His victims, all of whom were white, included an elderly woman, her pregnant daughter, and her two-year-old grandson. Free-man was quickly apprehended, but his mental health soon became a matter of controversy. Led by future Secretary of State William H. Seward, his counsel entered a plea of insanity, one of the first uses of the insanity defense in the nation.<br />The Van Nest killings and the trial of William Freeman, though illustrative of many aspects of antebellum society and culture, have never received in-depth attention. Drawing on newspapers, trial accounts, and private papers, Arpey firmly shows the political machinations of the case, the heated debate it set off on the relation-ship between race and crime, the use of punishment, and the boundaries of legal responsibility. His superb reconstruction of the trial, the motivations of the many actors, and the trial's status in American history place this book alongside the best crime novels of its kind.<br />Excerpt: On Friday, March 13, 1846, the editor of the Albany Evening Journal received details, via telegraph from Utica, of a `Most Horrible Murder' that had taken place the previous evening. The earliest details of the bloody scene were shocking, and were made all the more terrifying by the fact that the perpetrator was still at large... . Freeman's arrest did not result in an immediately satisfactory answer to the question being asked across the state: Why did this man kill violently this particular family? That the victims included a pregnant woman, a two-year-old child, and an elderly woman made the crime seem incomprehensibly brutal and bizarre. . . . In Auburn, local residents of `every class and sex' flocked to the county jail to cast their eyes upon Freeman. ... The brutality of the killings and Freeman's bizarre behavior following his capture thrust his mental health into question.... Anger and suspicion regarding the man in custody for the atrocities committed at Fleming only increased with time. `Since his confinement he has endeavored to convince him [sic] that he is insane, by talking to himself, saying that they were asleep that he killed, and using all sorts of incoherent expressions,' the Rochester Daily Advertiser reported several days after Freeman's arrest. . . . Suspicion that Freeman feigned insanity was not surprising. To many, insanity seemed but a clever conspiracy concocted by crafty lawyers to spare their depraved clients appropriate punishment.\\"the state: Why did this man kill violently this particular family?

(Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society) (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Major Scholarship	Baccio Bandinelli and Art at the Medici Court: A Corpus of Early Modern Sources by Louis Alexander Waldman (American Philosophical Society) More than five centuries after his birth, the contradictions embodied by the Florentine sculptor Baccio Bandinelli (1493-1560) remain as mysterious as ever. Revered by contemporaries as one of the most important sculptors of his time, he was reviled by his enemies as a truculent, foul-mouthed, avaricious, sycophantic, craven humbug-the farcical image immortalized as the character of Fieramosca in Berlioz's 1838 opera Benvenuto Cellini. But the originality and power of Bandinelli's work, and the long shad-ow it cast over the arts in sixteenth-century Florence and Rome, are as unmistakably clear today as they were to the artist's Medici patrons, who recognized his art as a potent tool for constructing an image of dynastic legitimacy.<br />Based on a decade of research in archives all over Italy, Baccio Bandinelli and Art at the Medici Court: A Corpus of Early Modem Sources brings this great but often neglected Renaissance artist into sharper focus for modern scholarship. It comprises a comprehensive collection of the documentation on Bandinelli's life and work. The great majority of the texts included in this volume were discovered by the author and are published for the first time, and many come from the private archive of the Bandinelli family.<br />This book presents a rich, balanced, and at times surprising picture of an artist whose career has all too often been viewed through the jaundiced eyes of his enemies-especially Giorgio Vasari and Benvenuto Cellini-whose far from impartial accounts have long exerted an unduly preponderant influence on Bandinelli's place in art history. All of Bandinelli's major artistic commissions are fully documented, as is his establishment of one of the earliest artistic academies. The sources presented here make it possible to know Baccio with a degree of intimacy that has few parallels in the historiography of Renaissance art. In this rich mosaic of contemporary sources, one can watch Bandinelli wringing commissions and rewards from his patrons, and one can hear his pithy views on art, artists, and the Medici family. But there are also many glimpses of Baccio the man-his amorous exploits, his brawls at fisticuffs, and his persistent struggles to elevate himself to the status of the Florentine patriciate through a trumped-up claim of nobility.<br />All the documents are furnished with historical commentary and textual apparatus discussing their broader historical con-text, problems of chronology and interpretation, and later interpolations-including hundreds of forged passages inserted by the artist's grandson, the genealogist Baccio Bandinelli the Younger (1578-1636), whose role as forger of the Bandinelli legacy is exposed here for the first time.riography of Renaissance art.

B. Yeats wove Indian, Japanese, and Irish forms together in his poetry and plays, Irish writers found kinships in Asian and West Asian cultures. This book maps the unacknowledged discourse of Irish Orientalism within Ireland's complex colonial heritage. Relying on cultural and postcolonial theory, Joseph Lennon examines Irish impressions of Asia and West Asia, understood together as the Orient in the West.<br />British writers from Cambrensis to Spenser depicted Ireland as a remote borderland inhabited by wild descendants of Asian Scythians-barbarians to the ancient Greeks. Contemporaneous Irish writers likewise borrowed classical traditions, imagining the Orient as an ancient homeland. Lennon traces the influence of Irish Orientalism through origin Iegends, philology, antiquarianism, and historiography into Irish literature and culture, exploring the works of Keating, O'Flaherty, Swift, Vallancey, Sheridan, Moore, Croker, Owenson, Mangan, de Vere, and others. He explores a key moment of Irish Orientalism-the twentieth-century Celtic Revival-discussing the works of Gregory, Casement, Connolly, and Joyce, but focusing on Theosophist writers W. B. Yeats, George Russell, James Stephens, and James Cousins.<br />Excerpt: The dominant imperial discourse of European Orientalism emerged in Britain and France; this discourse had considerable impact in Ireland, but Irish Orientalism has a distinct history. Native Irish representations of Asian and West Asian cultures date back to an Irish tradition in the ninth century. Many of these representations depict Irish ancestors migrating from Asia. Following these early narratives of the Orient, Ireland has been identified, compared, and contrasted with various Asian cultures. For early modern and medieval Irish writers, parts of the Orient signaled Ireland's ancient heritage. Later, because of Ireland's complex relationship with the British Empire, the Orient also came to signify another arm of British conquest for many Irish writers. Witnessing the process of cultural misrepresentation given by British commentators and historians of Ireland, Irish writers often highlighted the constructed nature of cultural representations when discussing both Irish history and the Orient. Imperial British texts had long compared Ireland with other Oriental cultures, at first in order to textually barbarize Ireland and later in order to discover intra-imperial strategies for governing its colonies. Such British representations further encouraged Irish writers to use the Orient allegorically and indirectly comment on cultural differences, nationalism, unionism, sectarianism, and imperialism. To study Irish writings on the Orient, therefore, is also to study Irish cultural narratives of antiquity, Celticism, and nation.<br />The pervasive nature of the Celtic-Oriental affinity has long been seen as an underlying tissue of Irish culture, based on legends of successive migrations to Ireland from the Orient recorded as Ireland's origin legends in the medieval chronicle Lebor Gab&aacute;la &Eacute;renn. Evidence of such affinities has subsequently been claimed in race, language, and culture and more particularly in music (Arabian-Moroccan-Celtic), knot work (Ethiopian-Arabic-Celtic), mysticism (Indian-Persian-Irish), travel and trade (Scythian-Phoenician-Celtic), architecture (Egyptian-Indian-Eskimo-Celtic), physiognomy (Mongol-African-Gael), ancient dress (Chinese-Scythian-Celtic), ancient law (Brahmin-Brehon), warfare (Egyptian-Scythian-Celtic), politics (Irish-Indian-Persian-Egyptian-Chinese), and, generally, sensibility ( on the Orient not only brought these origin legends appear in a variety of texts: grammatical texts, genealogies, histories and pseudohistories, pastoral dialogues, pseudo-letter collections, travel narratives, antiquarian studies, Orientalist romances, Celticist studies, popular fiction, anti-colonial critiques, syncretic Irish-Asian works. Viewed apart, these texts have seemed idiosyncratic to literary scholars. Viewed together, they coalesce as a history and constitute an unacknowledged discourse in Irish culture and European imperialism-a discourse that seeded decolonizing critiques of imperialism around the globe.<br />Scholars have dismissed Irish Orientalist representations as significant because they seem provincial borrowings from British, French, and German Orientalism or because they are based in legend and speculation, not in science or modern historiography. Until recently, studies of Irish nationalism have also passed over Celtic-Oriental and Irish-Asian representations, dismissing them for being self-deprecating or reactionary, for merely reversing the imperial stereotypes of Orientalists and Celticists. Supposedly defined by the semiotic binary of imperial assertions and nationalist reversals, Irish Orientalism has been dismissed as a distinctive discourse, seen as an impossibility by nationalist critics in British, Irish, and postcolonial arenas. But this dismissal is valid only if the supremacy of the imperial-nationalist dynamic is admitted. Because arguments that dismiss Irish Orientalist writers as defensive joiners or opportunistic chanters (on either the imperial or the nationalist side) are discussed later, I will not discuss them here. This study itself runs the danger of also being dismissed as the latest in a long series of illogical discussions about connections between the Oriental and the Celt. But the goal of this work is not to reassert the legendary Oriental origins of the Irish. The goal is to re-veal a semiotic history, as well as the cultural contexts and the ramifications of Ireland's Oriental imaginings.-colonial critiques, syncretic Irish-Asian works.

Cahnman, edited by Judith T. Marcus, Zoltan Tarr (Transaction Publishers) Studies of the Jewish experience among peoples with whom they live share some similarities with the usual histories of anti-Semitism, but also some differences. When the focus is on anti-Semitism, Jewish history appears as a record of unmitigated hostility against the Jewish people and of passivity on their part. However, as Werner J. Cahnman demonstrates in this posthumous volume, Jewish-Gentile relations are far more complex. There is a long history of mutual contacts, positive as well as antagonistic, even if conflict continues to require particular attention.<br />Cahnman's approach, while following a historical sequence, is sociological in conception. From Roman antiquity through the Middle Ages, into the era of emancipation and the Holocaust, and finally to the present American and Israeli scene, there are basic similarities and various dissimilarities, all of which are described and analyzed. Cahnman tests the theses of classical sociology implicitly, yet unobtrusively. He traces the socio-economic basis of human relations, which Marx and others have emphasized, and considers Jews a &quot;marginal trading people&quot; in the Park-Becker sense. Simmel and Toennies, he shows, understood Jews as &quot;strangers&quot; and &quot;intermediaries.&quot; While Cahnman shows that Jews were not &quot;pariahs,&quot; as Max Weber thought, he finds a remarkable affinity to Weber's Protestantism-capitalism argument in the tension of Jewish-Christian relations emerging from the bitter theological argument over usury.<br />The primacy of Jewish-Gentile relations in all their complexity and variability is essential for the under-standing of Jewish social and political history. This volume is a valuable contribution to that understanding.<br />Cahnman's historical account runs from Roman antiquity through the Middle Ages, into the era of emancipation and the Holocaust, and finally to the present American and Israeli scene. To be sure, as far as the &quot;present&quot; American and Israeli scene is concerned, the account appears unfinished as well as dated. But the basic similarities and dissimilarities throughout history are laid out and analyzed. He tests the theses of classical sociology implicitly, yet unobtrusively. For example, he traces the socio-economic basis of human relations emphasized by Marx and others, and considers Jews as &quot;strangers&quot; and &quot;intermediaries.&quot; He disagrees with Max Weber in that for him Jews were not &quot;pariahs&quot; although he finds a remarkable affinity to Weber's Protestantism-capitalism argument in the tension of Jewish-Christian relations emerging from the bitter theological argument over usury, where the antagonism between Jews and Gentiles took on a pronouncedly socio-economic rather than religious character. It is depicted how the nineteenth century added a nationalist dimension as well as the distortions of biology and race, with fateful con-sequences.<br />For Werner Cahnman, the sociological study of Jewish Gentile relations was of importance for more than one reason. For one, he held that the preservation of past history &quot;must serve as pillars of the new Jewish consciousness which is to arise out of the memories of the past.&quot; And similarly to his promotion of intercultural relations that guided his establishment of The Rashi Association, he counted this time too on the psychological and educational impact of the examination of Jewish history that proved to be part and parcel of Gentile history. Finally, it attests to Cahnman's self-understanding as a sociologist and a student of Jewish life. On the occasion of his seventieth birthday, he was asked about his approach to Jewish history. His answer? An approach from the vantage point of the historical sociologist, and a scholar who is not chiefly concerned with &quot;isolated phenomena but with relations between phenomena.&quot; In fact, he continued,<br />When I came to understand that the trader and the peasant live in symbiosis and conflict, I was relieved....The Jewish people dwells among the nations, whether in Israel or in the Diaspora, and the tensions between intimate symbiosis and bitter conflict remains a guiding theme of Jewish history.'<br />In sum, for Cahnman the primacy of Jewish-Gentile relations in all their complexity and variability seemed essential for the under-standing of Jewish social and political history. While it is evident that the history of post-Emancipation German Jewry and of the Holocaust aftermath has received considerable scholarly attention, the study of Jewish life in the Diaspora, or the migrational movements has been somewhat neglected; Cahnman clearly was intent to fill the gap. His research data, his personal experiences, and historical view combined resulted in a scholarly lifework that should constitute an important element in any future large-scale historical account. Reminiscent of Martin Buber, Cahnman makes a confessional statement in this regard: &quot;I shall try to testify... in the belief that what I have to say will stand for the truth which, while it becomes manifest only in personal experience, nevertheless transcends it.&quot;nomena but with relations between phenomena.&quot; In fact, he continued,<BR>When I came to understand that the trader and the peasant live in symbiosis and conflict, I was relieved....The Jewish people dwells among the nations, whether in Israel or in the Diaspora, and the tensions between intimate symbiosis and bitter conflict remains a guiding theme of Jewish history.'<BR>In sum, for Cahnman the primacy of Jewish-Gentile relations in all their complexity and variability seemed essential for the under-standing of Jewish social and political history.

Here, he maintains that the shifting styles and techniques of Joyce's work are a function of two interacting realities-the external reality of a particular time and place and the internal reality of a character's mental state. In making this case Gordon offers up a number of new readings: how Stephen Dedalus conceives and composes his villanelle; why the Dubliners story about Little Chandler is titled &quot;A Little Cloud&quot;; why Gerty MacDowell suddenly appears and disappears; what is happening when Leopold Bloom stares for two minutes on end at a beer bottle's label; why the triangle etched at the center of Finnegans Wake doubles itself and grows a pair of circles; why the next to last chapter of Ulysses has, by far, the book's highest incidence of the letter C; and who is the man in the macintosh.<br />Gordon, whose authoritative &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;: A Plot Summary received critical acclaim and is considered one of the standard references, revises-and challenges-the received version of reality. For instance, Joyce features ghost visitations, telepathy, and other paranormal phenomena not as 'flights into fantasy' but because he believed in the real possibility of such occurrences.<br />This book is what Hollywood would call a prequel to my earlier &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;: A Plot Summary. There, I set out to show that for all its verbal arabesque, Joyce's most perplexing work nonetheless maintained its author's lifelong commitment to his own brand of realism, to the mimetic rendering of a world in which real things happen, in chronological succession, according to laws of cause and effect. That phrase &quot;his own brand of realism&quot; requires some explaining, which is where this book comes in. I am undertaking to explore, through Joyce's work leading up to Finnegans Wake, the evolution of Joycean reality and the Joycean strategies for expressing and dramatizing it.nnegans Wake, the evolution of Joycean reality and the Joycean strategies for expressing and dramatizing it.	2004-06-15

Decrane (Georgetown University Press) it is widely recognized that postmodernism has shaped contemporary approaches to theology and ethics) Given this fact, a writer must make clear at the outset the ways in which she responds to the postmodern challenge regarding the use of classic texts and universal claims. However, the issue is not as simple as responding to a singular postmodern challenge. Rather, the postmodern critique of modern, liberal, Enlightenment-based convictions holds within it a range of orientations toward purported universal truths. This book is a response to these postmodern positions. At the same time, it offers a constructive method for retrieving a classic text from the Christian tradition-Thomas Aquinas's principle of the common good-from a feminist, liberationist perspective, and applying this text to contemporary issues in women's health care in the United States.<br />Some postmodern positions reject many, most, or sometimes all classic texts as no longer relevant or usable because they bear the enduring (some would say imprisoning) presumptions of the contexts in which they developed and which render the texts otiose, having little or no cultural, philosophical, scientific, sociological, religious, or ethical bearing on the current situation. From a feminist perspective, the misogyny identified in many classic texts-or the negative presumptions about women (and nonwhite persons) embedded in universal claims-appears so blatant and/or pervasive, that it seems impossible to find in these texts any contribution to the human project. This is also true for most feminist scholars in the Christian tradition who find in the classic texts-especially, but not limited to, the Scriptures-and in many Christian doctrines judgments about women presented as universal truth claims that in themselves are denigrating and untrue, and which have functioned historically to justify social, economic, and religious relationships of power that are extremely harmful to women. In the face of this critique, some Christian feminist scholars withdraw the designations \\"canonical\\" \\"authoritative,\\" or \\"revelatory\\" from Christian texts or from parts of texts that reveal insupportable presumptions and judgments about women. Rosemary Radford Ruether's now classic statement represents this position:<br />Whatever denies, diminishes, or distorts the full humanity of women is, therefore, appraised as not redemptive. Theologically speaking, whatever diminishes or denies the full humanity of women must be presumed not to reflect the divine or an authentic relation to the divine, or to reflect the authentic nature of things, or to be the message or work of an authentic redeemer or a community of redemptions.<br />Other Christian feminist scholars have responded to the scriptural and doctrinal aspects of the Christian tradition that denigrate the dignity of women by withdrawing from the Christian tradition altogether, judging it to be irredeemably misogynistic.<br />Postmodernity has given rise to another trajectory. Here, efforts to find rapprochement between diverse views-such as Hans-Georg Gadamer's notion of the \\"to and fro\\" of conversation as a model of interpretation, and David Tracy's effort to bring the wisdom and values of a theological tradition into the public arena-are rejected. Rather, the classic texts and traditional doctrines (and traditional interpretations of the doctrines) of the community are given pride of place by the community or person. This approach finds expression in the Christian tradition in the writings of George Lindbeck. In his framework, priority is given to the Scriptures among the various sources for Christian theology, and reason and experience are given less weight.<br />Decrane's argument is that many of the postmodern critiques regarding the oppressive, crippling presumptions identified in many classic texts (as well as in traditional formulations of many Christian doctrines) are deeply needed in order to argue effectively against the texts, interpretations, and doctrines judged by women to be facile, erroneous, oppressive, and reductionistic. This critique is not simply a worthy intellectual exercise, but extends to a critique of systems, institutions, and policies that are based on these texts and doctrines and which have harmed women in particular. At the same time, however, a feminist, liberationist retrieval of the principle of the common good not only contributes to the project of feminist ethics but makes the Christian moral tradition richer by exposing the relevance and significance of the classic principle in a venue very different from its historical origins.<br />The more radical forms of postmodern relativism, which reject the possibility of virtually any universal claims, are a shortsighted response to the abuses of universal claims in the past. In fact, classic texts of a tradition may serve as sources of insight and wisdom if retrieved through a rigorous, critical process. To reject classic texts leaves the human community stripped of enduring sources of human wisdom and moral insight. In order to defend this claim, however, one must demonstrate a critical way to adjudicate and retrieve both classic texts and traditions that have been part of sustaining the oppressive social and religious systems against women. This is essential if one is to prevent merely cosmetic realignments of the same oppressive insights and conclusions.<br />In order to accomplish this, Decrane retrieves Thomas Aquinas's principle of the common good-a fundamental ethical proposition in the Christian (and particularly the Roman Catholic) tradition-and apply it to two issues in health care in the United States: women's health in general, and black women and breast cancer in particular. Retrieving this principle is significant in that it will demonstrate that a feminist, liberationist approach to ethics can accommodate and appropriate a universal claim that has seemed, for centuries, to oppress-not liberate-women.n doctrines) are deeply needed in order to argue effectively against the texts, interpretations, and doctrines judged by women to be facile, erroneous, oppressive, and reductionistic.

The author explains how the diverse and dynamic nature of New Age spiritualities requires methods of research that highlight plurality. His analysis of current descriptions of the field shows that many typologies of the thought and practices of those within the New Age have not reflected the actual experiences and beliefs of those they seek to describe. This text proposes a new theoretical model, and a detailed methodological framework for research using the idea of a weblike network. The empirical investigations into organizations and individuals provide ideographic evidence for the web model. Corrywright offers some empirical survey research as an corrective to the too bookish studies of New Age religions where the literary output of leaders is given often scarily critical scrutiny.	2004-06-15

Most Euro-Americans would tend to answer this question by highlighting the politics of the globalization process whereby a particular cultural project, the Euro-American project, is being transformed into a global one. They would do so, what is more, in a characteristically Euro-American way, promoting in the process the sort of person Euro-Americans tend to represent.<br />What, then, is world politics? Read with the word &quot;world&quot; italicized, other agendas begin to emerge, that locate these politics in larger contexts. Such a reading not only suggests the possibility of seeing world affairs as world ones. It also anticipates a world affairs discipline more worthy of the name.<br />This study attempts to answer the questions posed above, though to answer the second reading (what is world politics?) it must first of all answer the first. It begins, then, by briefly outlining the modernist study of world affairs. It goes on to compare these world affairs- and the culture of which they are a part-with world affairs as described and explained from other politico-cultural perspectives. It ends by comparing these world affairs, and the religion of which modernist culture is part, with world affairs as described and explained from other politico-spiritual perspectives.<br />The key purpose of this work is to show how the modernist prioritization of reason as an end in itself not only clarifies and extends our capacity to explain world affairs, but also constrains and skews every relevant explanation. These limits and distortions are most clearly demonstrated by subjecting modernist world affairs to analyses from communalist and sacralist perspectives, analyses that not only transgress the limits modernity sets, but also compensate for the distortions they create.<br />In attempting to extend the reach of the discipline, this is a study that moves outside the discipline's mainstream concerns. The discipline itself continues to grow, however, as the singular character of the cultural milieu in which these particular world affairs arose becomes more apparent, and as the singular character of the sacral milieu in which this particular cultural milieu arose becomes more apparent too.<br />When particular current events challenge the discipline's construction of its own mainstream, the need for a more comprehensive account of world affairs is seen to be acute. The need is a chronic one, however, since the modernist project never ceases to skew and constrain how world affairs are described, explained, and prescribed for in policy terms.<br />In seeking to augment what the discipline represents, the following study is obliged to interrogate the theoretical integrity of the foundations of modernist world affairs. It should be said at the outset, however, that it does not seek to abandon these foundations. Rather, it seeks to under-stand the consequences these foundations have for the study of the subject, to bring to bear upon them some relatively unfamiliar cultural and spiritual outlooks and insights, to extend the perimeters that modernist analyses impose, and to counter the misrepresentations that modernist analyses make.oves outside the discipline's mainstream concerns.

Will the execs heed?	Hollywood Economics: How Extreme Uncertainty Shapes the Film Industry by Arthur De Vanyn (Routledge) (Hardcover)<br />What do stars do for a movie? Aside from earning a higher least revenue, a star movie has only a slightly higher chance of making a profit than a non-star movie De Vanyn shows. If the star's agent extracts the higher expected profit in the star's fee, then the movie almost surely will lose money. This De Vanyn calls the curse of the superstar.<br />Opening big and leading at the box office is a momentary success. A movie has to attain or sustain box-office dominance over many weeks to make major money. The size of the opening does not predict how the ensuing battles will evolve or how much money the film will take in. Why do executives compete so strongly for stars when they can assure no more than a higher expectation of a movie's least revenue? It seems to be based on a belief that the opening predicts how much a movie will make. That turns out to be false, as this study shows.<br />The articles are grouped into four parts: dynamics, wild uncertainty, judges and lawyers and extremes. There are three chapters in each of these parts. De Vanyn  writes a brief introduction to each part noting the main issues, techniques and results of the papers contained therein. De Vanyn  has not sacrificed rigor or completeness; these are refereed articles, published in scientific journals and their results have been independently confirmed and replicated by other authors many times over.<br />De Vanyn  also provides a couple of new chapters that were not published previously. One of these concerns artists, primarily actors and directors. It examines how productive they are and how they are paid. De Vanyn establishes the Price-Evans law of artists, estimate the half life of a star and see if one can separate luck from talent in career patterns. In another new work for this book, De Vanyn puts all this work into a more complete model, a model that begins to bridge the gap between standard management and economic models and the reality of the business.<br />In the Epilogue he muses on how one might manage a business where nobody knows anything. It is here that De Vanyn takes up the fundamental flaws his research reveals about the way the modern corporate studio manages the movie business.<br />Finally perhaps we will see why conventional models fail spectacularly to explain the movies and why De Vanyn had to invent a new kind of economics to come to grips with this endlessly fascinating business. Perhaps De Vanyn has built a consistent and fundamental model of the industry that is of interest not just to scientists, but to movie fans and moviemakers, too. And De Vanyn shows that these models can be applied to other industries as well.<br />In science, as in the movies, creativity takes you to unexpected places. This study is exciting because we get unexpected and wonderful discoveries. It is hard to imagine at the outset that by applying high-brow mathematical and statistical science we end up proving Goldman's fundamental truth that, in the movies, &quot;nobody knows anything.&quot;<br />None of these results is more surprising than finding out that, hard-headed science puts the creative process at the very center of the motion picture universe. There is no fool proof formula. Outcomes cannot be predicted. There is no reason for management to get in the way of the creative process. Now tell then that!

One after the other he would turn them out after the day's work on his fiction was done-letters to close and distant acquaintances; obligatory letters of social courtesy and professional correspondence with publishers and his agent; long, thoughtful, or just gossipy letters to his family and to friends of various degrees of intimacy. His contact with so many when he was living quite reclusively as well as when he was sociable was remarkable. Letters maintained his connection with the America of his youth even after he had settled permanently in Europe. Letters sustained the relationships that wove his life into the foreign scene. But if one reads them in their calendar order in a comprehensive published gathering-even the lamentably incomplete selections of Percy Lubbock or Leon Edel soon to be superseded by a complete collection of James's letters-one can see the differences among letters written simultaneously.' Some of his letters to particular correspondents<br />that have been extracted from the mass and published separately in the last decade or so-particularly those to Wharton, William James, William Dean Howells, Henry Adams, Edmund Gosse, and Jessie Allen-exhibit the history of those partial Jamesian selves each relationship called into being.'<br />In the present volume, seventy-eight letters James wrote between 1899 and 191 5 to the Norwegian-American sculptor Hendrik Andersen have been transcribed from the original manuscripts and edited by Rosella Mamoli Zorzi.

In recent years, French literary scholars have been exploring the interpretive possibilities of textual history, turning manuscripts study into a recognized form of literary criticism. They have clearly demonstrated that manuscripts can be used for purposes other than establishing an accurate text of a work.<br />Although its raw material is a writer's manuscripts, genetic criticism owes more to structuralist and poststructuralist notions of textuality than to philology and textual criticism. As Genetic Criticism demonstrates, the chief concern is not the final text but the reconstruction and analysis of the writing process. Geneticists find endless richness in what they call the \\"avant-texte\\": a critical gathering of a writer's notes, sketches, drafts, manuscripts, typescripts, proofs, and correspondence. Together, the essays in this volume reveal how genetic criticism cooperates with such forms of literary study as narratology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, sociocriticism, deconstruction, and gender theory.<br />Genetic Criticism contains translations of eleven essays, general theoretical analyses as well as studies of individual authors such as Flaubert, Proust, Joyce, Zola, Stendhal, Chateaubriand, and Montaigne. Some of the essays are foundational statements, while others deal with such recent topics as noncanonical texts and the potential impact of hypertext on genetic study. A general introduction to the book traces genetic criticism's intellectual history, and separate introductions give precise contexts for each essay.<br />An important and timely examination of the interpretive possibilities of textual histories, Genetic Criticism provides a comprehensive survey of an increasingly significant form of contemporary literary criticism.<br />The volume ends with essays on topics of recent interest to geneticists. Philippe Lejeune addresses the paradox of reading autobiographies for their avant-textes, and Jean-Louis Lebrave argues that the theory of hypertexts has now reached the point where it can provide new and more accurate models for genetic studies, even of centuries-old manuscripts.<br />Jed Deppman has written separate introductions that outline each author's career and discuss each essay's specific purposes, methods, and arguments.<br />The collection begins with Louis Hay's overview of genetic criticism and continues with jean Bellemin-Noël's essay on the value of a psychoanalytic approach to genetic study. Pierre-Marc de Biasi's encyclopedia article, which spells out the principles and procedures of genetic study, closes the opening trio of general studies.<br />Next come six essays on the texts and avant-textes of specific authors. Raymonde Debray Genette studies the manuscripts of Flaubert's \\"A Simple Heart° to see how he crafted its ending; Jacques Neefs compares and contrasts the ideas Chateaubriand, Montaigne, and Stendhal had about the posthumous fate of their writings; Henri Mitterand inscribes Zola's Rougon-Macquart writings into their author's personal circumstances as well as broader cultural contexts; Daniel Ferrer and Jean-Michel Rabat&eacute; study the way Joyce manipulated and modernized the structure of the literary paragraph; closing this middle section, Almuth Gr&eacute;sillon and Catherine Viollet use concepts from linguistics to analyze Proust's manuscripts, Gr&eacute;sillon taking up issues of temporality and Viollet concentrating on gender and sexuality.

The Eighth Edition of Small Group Communication likewise draws on previous editions to produce a cutting-edge reader that should sustain the intellectual needs and pique the interest of today's students.<br />As in the past, this anthology was to serve as a general reader. Therefore, the editors have included materials that are broadly based and comprehensive. They avoided advocating any one particular theory or methodological approach to studying small group communication, preferring instead to give the reader a balanced sampling of the diverse philosophies and concepts that constitute the fascinating study of small group communication.<br />This edition continues a long-standing tradition of providing students with the most current thinking from the top scholars in the field of small group communication. Carry-over selections from previous editions have been updated, and a number of new readings have been added to make this anthology as up-to-date as possible.<br />What has not changed in this edition is the philosophy on how this book is put together. Group communication is a social activity with consequential outcomes. In other words, communication makes a difference in small groups. The reader will note that all selections focus on the link between communication and its group outcomes.<br />The Eighth Edition presents an organizational structure that departs from the &quot;mini-textbook&quot; format of the previous edition. Here, the readings are organized into eight parts. Part I, The Nature of Groups, presents three chapters introducing students to the definitions and characteristics of small groups. Part II, Theories of Small Group Communication, provides three chapters that elaborate on major theories of group communication. Part III, Organization of Groups, contains two chapters that discuss how groups and their communication develop and change over time. Part IV, Group Processes, has three chapters that present different aspects of group communication processes as they are exhibited in small groups. Part V, Groups and Teams, includes four chapters that focus on communication and performance in various kinds of groups and teams. Part VI, Leadership in Groups, provides three chapters that review major concepts and theories relevant to an understanding of small group leadership. Part VII, Diversity in Groups, features three chapters focusing on diversity and intercultural issues related to small groups. Part VIII, Analyzing Group Communication, consists of three chapters that elaborate on different methodological approaches to analyzing and studying communication processes in small groups.<br />The Editors begin each part with a short introduction explaining the importance of the area and topics covered.V, Group Processes, has three chapters that present different aspects of group communication processes as they are exhibited in small groups.

Thurman, Jihong Zhao (Roxbury Publishing Company) A primary purpose of this anthology is to provide readers with an up-to-date perspective on contemporary policing and emergent is-sues. In part we focus on controversial topics, of which there is certainly no shortage; we also look at the components of policing that might be broken or antiquated, of which there are also more than a few, and which are in need of resolution or reform. Finally, in addition to controversies and challenges, we also seek to offer the reader some examples of solutions that appear promising, and surprisingly enough, we did find some of these.<br />In putting together this anthology we committed ourselves to looking at excellent scholarship that is also very recent-the oldest article in the bunch is from 1996, ten of the thirty featured articles were published in 2000 or later, and six articles are new. This anthology may indeed be the most contemporary collection of policing articles currently available to academicians, practitioners, and students.<br />This anthology brings together an outstanding collection of articles on contemporary policing, written by some of the leading experts in the field. The first four selections examine the major new developments with respect to re-thinking the role of the police in American society. Lawrence W. Sherman opens the collection with a discussion of the basic issue for the police in a democratic society: the trust and confidence of citizens in criminal justice institutions. Ronald V. Clarke discusses both problem-oriented policing and community policing. Eli B. Silverman examines CompStat, a new administrative tool that has emerged as the most important innovation for enhancing police response to crime and disorder and responsiveness to community needs. Williard M. Oliver, meanwhile, looks at the processes by which innovation such as community policing and CompStat are diffused (or fail to diffuse) through the law enforcement community and become institutionalized.<br />Part II covers specific programs for controlling crime and disorder. Lawrence W. Sherman opens the section with a discussion of the larger police goal of crime prevention. The common theme of the other selections in Part II is problem-oriented policing. David Weisburd and Lorraine Green Mazerolle ex-amine the effectiveness of \\"hot spot\\" policing, a place-oriented approach that is widely regarded as the most promising police strategy. Glensor, Peak, and Correia examine another problem-oriented program that shifts the focus to crime victims and away from criminal offenders. Finally, Hochstein and Thurmanlook at another problem-oriented program that seeks to ensure safety in public housing units by screening out suspected offenders.<br />Part III examines a set of issues related to the internal management of police departments, including the role of middle management, job satisfaction among officers, early warning systems for identifying officers with performance problems, and the selection and training of new officers.<br />Part IV covers the external environment of policing. It examines the particularly controversial issues of the use of force, high-speed pursuits, policing gangs, and racial profiling. In each of these areas there are new public concerns, new data, and new administrative controls designed to reduce misconduct.<br />Part V is devoted to a variety of innovations in policing. It includes selections devoted to aspects of community policing and problem-oriented policing, and three selections cover new technologies and their applications to policing.<br />Part VI examines police misconduct and is-sues related to police ethics. Two selections cover traditional issues, corruption and drug-related misconduct, while two others look at new issues-at least, issues that have not been publicly examined-using citizen complaints as a management toolfor identifying officers with problems and sexual misconduct by officers.g officers with problems and sexual misconduct by officers.	2004-06-13

Gibson (Blackwell Publishers) (Paperback) From Naming to Saying examines the classical question of the unity of the proposition: how the parts of the sentence which separately name an object and a property combine to say some single thing or express a proposition.<br />The volume presents and discusses three great historical theories: Frege's doctrine of concept and object, Russell's analysis of the sentence, and Wittgenstein's picture theory of meaning. It explores whether the semantic distinction between subject and predicate can be explained, as P. F. Strawson maintained, by the metaphysical distinction between the things named, particulars and universals. And it offers a novel solution, arguing that the utterance of a sentence expresses a unitary proposition because of the interlocking causal explanations of the constituent utterances that comprise the act of uttering a sentence.<br />This book is a study of the unity of the sentence. Part I presents and criticizes three classical theories: Frege's doctrine of concept and object, Russell's analysis of the sentence, and Wittgenstein's picture theory of meaning. Part II focuses on the relation between the semantic distinction between subject and predicate (referring vs. predicating) and the grammatical, logical, and metaphysical distinctions that are drawn between subjects and predicates. P. F. Strawson has elaborately defended the view that the difference in the kind of thing that is designated by subjects and predicates - the difference between particulars and universals - lies at the basis of the grammatical, semantic, and logical distinctions. Gibson questios whether a unified theory of predication can explain these various phenomena, and whether the metaphysical difference between particulars and universals does, in fact, explain the semantic function of subjects and predicates.<br />In Part III, Gibson develops a pragmatic explanation of the unity of the sentence, arguing that the utterance of a sentence expresses a proposition because of certain unity in the causal explanations of the constituent utterances that comprise the complex act of uttering a sentence. In particular, she arguse that the differing functional role of subject and predicate in virtue of which the sentence expresses a proposition can be traced to a distinctive, asymmetrical causal explanation of the tokening of the expression serving one role or another in the speech act. Gibson proposes that there is an interconnection and interdependence of the cause of the utterance of the predicate on the cause of the utterance of the subject that explains the unity of the sentence. The unity of the sentence is explained in terms of the unity of the act of the utterance and the pragmatic character of the expressions rather than by the ontology of what those expressions denote. The account has it roots in the pragmatic distinction between subject and predicate set out by John Cook Wilson and F. P. Ramsey, and in the idea, worked out in different ways in the writing of J. L. Austin and H. P. Grice, that the meaning of sentences is a function of what a speaker is doing in uttering words. The account Gibson provides was conceived within the framework of the kind of causal or information-based theories of meaning that have been developed by Dennis Stampe and Fred Dretske, among others. In the end, however, the view she proposes does not depend upon an acceptance of those views of meaning.

Gaillard artfully inter-weaves fresh stories of ordinary people with the familiar ones of the civil rights icons.<br />We meet Vernon Johns, King's predecessor at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, who first suggested the bus boycott and who wrote later, &quot;It is a heart strangely un-Christian that cannot thrill with joy when the least of men begin to pull in the direction of the stars.&quot; We hear from John Hulett who tells how fear of lynching forced him down into ditches whenever headlights appeared on a night road. We see the Edmund Pettus Bridge beatings from the perspective of marcher JoAnne Bland, who was only a child at the time. We learn of E. D. Nixon, a Pullman porter who helped organize the bus boycott and who later choked with emotion when, for the first time, a white man extended his hand in greeting to him on a public street.<br />How these ordinary people rose to the challenges of an unfair system with a will and determination that changed their times forever is a fascinating and extraordinary story that Gaillard tells with his hall-mark talent. Cradle of Freedom unfolds with the dramatic flow of a novel, yet it is based on meticulous research. With authority and grace, Gaillard explains how the southern state deemed the Cradle of the Confederacy became, with great struggle, some loss, and much hope, the Cradle of Freedom.	2004-05-26

One reason for Schelling's lack of popularity is that he is something of a problem case for traditional narratives about the history of philosophy. Although he is often slotted in as a stepping stone on the intellectual journey from Kant to Hegel, any attention to his ideas will show that he does not fit this role very well. His later philosophy suggests a materialism and empiricism that puts him outside of idealism proper; his connection with the romantic movement suggests an aestheticism that challenges traditional philosophy as such; and his mysticism allies him with medieval, pre-critical philosophies considered antiquated by the nineteenth century. And if Schelling was not entirely at home with his contemporaries, he seems, on the face of it, to have fared little better with his future: there has been no Schelling school, he has had no followers. No historical trajectory announces Schelling as its point of departure.<br />And yet Schelling's influence has been an extraordinary one. He has inspired physicists, physicians, theologians, historians and poets. A wildly diverse set of philosophers have claimed that their ideas have resonance with his. Perhaps the question of Schelling's influence can be approached by looking at what Kant says about works of genius - that they should give rise to inspiration, not imitation. Paradoxically, to imitate genius is not to produce an imitation but a new creative work. Whether or not Schelling should be strictly viewed as a genius, Kant's notion suggests a sense in which Schelling should be understood as a 'philosopher's philosopher': he inspired creativity, not repetition. In this perspective, the lack of a 'Schelling school' is a sign of strength; Schelling is continually being rediscovered, and his works have retained a fresh and untimely character. If Schelling does not have any obvious historical successors, it is because his influence cannot be charted by the usual methods. New philosophical tools are needed in order to understand his philosophical significance, his impact on contemporary thought and relevance for contemporary concerns.<br />Perhaps Schelling's thought presents these challenges because it is 'unsystematic' (although, of course, this does not preclude a certain unity of problematic). This 'unsystem' arises, on the one hand, from Schelling's attempts to produce a philosophical encounter with the irrational and, on the other hand, from the fact that the sheer number of `systems' he created undermines the notion of unitary system in the sense intended by Kant or Hegel. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that twentieth-century European thought is motivated by a struggle to escape from this notion of a unitary philosophical system imposed largely by German thought in the previous century; consequently, it comes as no surprise that Schelling's thought allies itself with so many different - and mutually incompatible - strands in the contemporary. We see traces of Schelling in both twentieth-century idealism and materialism, in existentialism, Marxism, psycho-analysis and even deconstruction. But it also follows from this notion of `unsystem' that these alliances or affinities often cannot be expressed in terms of the standard conception of influence, with its institutional presuppositions of schools and expositors that form the concrete correlates of the philosophical conception of system. Rather, we need some other conceptualization of Schelling's reach into the present. Karl Jaspers wrote:<br />To study Schelling, to look with new eyes at who Schelling is and where he leads, to follow him from his great beginnings, to see through his magic and to let him speak to us from his prevailing modes and ways of thinking - this largely means: to grasp the possibilities and dangers of contemporary philosophy. Schelling's reality, his rich mental life, the way he presents himself is not an example [Vorbild) to be copied, but rather a prototype [Urbild) of modern possibilities.'<br />The pieces in this collection will view Schelling as Urbild rather than Vorbild, and explore the possibilities he opened up for modern thought.<br />Schelling's impact on and relevance for twentieth-century thought can be seen most strongly in four different areas: materialism, existentialism, psychoanalysis and religion. The heterogeneity of the articles collected in this volume is testimony to the diversity and fruitfulness of Schelling's thought, evidence that Schelling articulated a wide range of ideas that other and later traditions would follow through to their limit. Most of all, these articles show that, after 200 years, Schelling is still new., his rich mental life, the way he presents himself is not an example [Vorbild) to be copied, but rather a prototype [Urbild) of modern possibilities.'<BR>The pieces in this collection will view Schelling as Urbild rather than Vorbild, and explore the possibilities he opened up for modern thought.<BR>Schelling's impact on and relevance for twentieth-century thought can be seen most strongly in four different areas: materialism, existentialism, psychoanalysis and religion.

The cosmos was bound in a sphere. The world was gridded and plotted, the seas navigated, and the land was surveyed. Spatial practices were codified, a spatial sensitivity was created, and a cartographic literacy was established through the increasing use of maps and the creation of a cartographic language for new map-pings of the world, state, and city.<br />Short establishes that such spatial revisioning is connected to the promotion of commercial and national interests. Developments in navigation, for example, were often encouraged and promoted by both the state and merchant companies. Surveying was closely connected to the rising cost of land and the increasing commodification of agriculture. The long price rise of land in the sixteenth century was an important factor in developing the spatial practices of map-ping and surveying. In addition, Short highlights the role of occult practices in the new spatial sciences. The cosmographers of the sixteenth century encompassed a wide arc of intellectual endeavors.<br /> Excerpt: Modern space-the space the modern world inhabits and `sees'-was created in Europe between 1475 and 1600. It was produced using a variety of means, including the use of the grid to plot the world; the use of the cosmographical sphere as the starting point for the mathematically derived practices of navigation and surveying; the increasing use of maps; and the creation of a cartographic language for new mappings of the world, states, and cities. In this new spatial practice, the world was enmeshed in a grid, laced with compass lines and seen through the lens of the theodolite, back-staff, and cross-staff. New techniques of spatial surveillance were employed by the state, private companies, and powerful individuals in acts of land commodification and colonial appropriation.<br />The space in which most of the contemporary world is viewed, a gridded space empty of history yet full of promise, was constructed in Europe between 1475 and 1600. This period marks a transition zone between two differing views of space. The first view saw space and time as being deeply intertwined, with history as well as geography forming an important part of geographical representation. The second view, however, began to visualize a space more independent of history. These views do not constitute a simple dichotomy between an easily demarcated &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; The medieval period was not an unchanging block, and the Renaissance was deeply marked by a medieval heritage. How-ever, it is possible to discern the construction of a modern space of the grid, the map, and the survey. Plotted on the grid of latitude and longitude, this new world was produced on maps and negotiated in new methods in navigation and surveying that allowed the world to be not only seen but also explored and appropriated.<br />Mapping was never politically neutral or socially indeterminate. The Renaissance introduced a new way of seeing the world, describing the world, and mapping the world that anticipated both the Enlightenment and colonialism. Maps of the Renaissance reflect and embody new forms of scientific understanding and new techniques of territorial appropriation.were employed by the state, private companies, and powerful individuals in acts of land commodification and colonial appropriation.<BR>The space in which most of the contemporary world is viewed, a gridded space empty of history yet full of promise, was constructed in Europe between 1475 and 1600.

Through Cady's treatment, the politician, philosopher, scientist, artist, athlete, and entertainer is presented in his or her unique greatness-or infamy.<br />The rare black-and-white photographs in Icons establish the book's unparalleled visual impact. They are by turns elegiac and haunting, celebratory and enchanting-all are arresting portraits of the century's most familiar faces caught in unfamiliar and revealing lights. Culled from archives around the world, the images in Icons represent the best of modern photography, with works by such masters as Henri Cartier-Bresson himself one of the icons), Helmut Newton, Cecil Beaton, and Robert Capa.<br />Powerful, intriguing, and informative, Icons is a visually stunning, historically sweeping work, destined to become a collector's item.<br />The two hundred individuals included in Icons of the Twentieth Century were chosen with the help of a multi-national Board of Advisors, respected leaders in the arts and sciences, in politics, publishing, education, fashion, entertainment and technology. Asked to base their deletions, nominations and rankings on their following definition of an icon: &quot;Individuals whose names and faces have impacted us all and whose deeds-for good or ill-have literally shaped the course of modern history.&quot; When the ballots were tallied, about fifteen percent of the 200-name list-the nominations which garnered only a few votes each-fell at the thin end of the statistical bell curve. It was here that the combined efforts of the author, the publisher and the project's editors and researchers were called into service.<br />No grouping, of course, can ever be complete, nor can there be any objective criteria for hierarchical importance-not even for who is included and who is not. Questions will immediately arise: Why Nasser and not Khomeni? Why not Idi Amin, whose face came to symbolize the destruction of Africa in the post-colonial period, or Kwame Nkuma, whose independent Ghana initially offered a better hope for a continent in turmoil? Why not Konrad Adenauer, who out of the ruins of the Third Reich established the beginnings of post-World War democracy in Germany? And why Emperor Hirohito and not Tojo whose leadership of Japan may have had more to do with World War II in Asia than the imperial family? In the end, it would have been impossible to include every famous political leader of the century without eliminating key individuals in, say, music or literature.<br />Acknowledging that in this century government leaders-whether mass executioners or sun-kings-ipso facto dominated the world stage, it was decided they would not overrun Icons.<br />There were many others who made us think differently about our world-originals like Alfred Kinsey, Buckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan-who were not included. In some cases, it was because heir faces were simply not as recognizable as others, an important consideration because of the book's defining concept of eikon, or image. A similar point can be made for many of the century's innovators, individuals whose inventions-the television, the computer, the jet engine, the Pill, penicillin-are much more well known than they are. But Icons was about people not things.<br />Given that the major categories of human endeavor were to be represented, choice was difficult when there were too many candidates in one category, which was often the case. Why Nureyev and not also Nijinsky or Balanchine? Why Billie Holiday and not also Bessie Smith and Ella Fitzgerald? Marcel Proust and not also Thomas Mann and William Faulkner? Why Babe Ruth and not Joe DiMaggio? Why not dozens of other high profile sports stars and performers, all iconic in their way due to the development of mass media in our century? Behind each inclusion and exclusion lie endless arguments. But the selection made at the end of the day is at best a selection.Marshall McLuhan-who were not included.

The role of the Security Council and the General Assembly in the mechanism will be discussed, and the origins of United Nations peace-keeping will be studied by means of four case-studies of observation missions and peacekeeping missions. Also, an examination will be made in Chapter 1 of the constitutional basis of United Nations peacekeeping operations, as well as the competence of the Security Council and of the General Assembly to create peacekeeping forces, and of the role of the Secretary-General in the area of international peace and security. The lastsection of Chapter 1 will deal with peacekeeping operations by regional arrangements or agencies in the context of Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.<br />Chapter 2 commences with a historical overview of the United Nations peacekeeping operations. An extensive review of varied definitions and theories of peacekeeping will follow which illustrates the evolution of United Nations peacekeeping operations. The review demonstrates that two features can be found in peacekeeping operations after the end of the Cold War, as described above. To clarify the concept of peacekeeping, the legal distinction between peacekeeping and enforcement action will be discussed. Chapter 2 concludes with a focus on non-military functions of peacekeeping, which in practice contains peacemaking and peace-building functions. Human rights are essential elements of such functions. The first two chapters thus explain how the Organisation reached the point of being largely involved in human rights work within the framework of peacekeeping.<br />The four chapters thereafter are devoted to case-studies. These chapters contain a detailed examination of the actual human rights activities per-formed in four different areas of the world by UN peacekeeping missions or a UN human rights field operation. The areas being examined are El Salvador, Cambodia, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. The operations in each area approached and challenged the human rights problems differently, which shows that there has been a consistent lack of effort by the Organisation to study and make use of the skills and experience gained in preceding operations.' Several points of analysis will be set up for examination in each case-study for the purpose of enabling a comparison of similar functions in different operations. One important factor for future peacekeeping operations when they undertake human rights functions will inevitably be institution-building, such as the reform of the judicial system or the restructuring and training of police forces. Peacekeeping, as a temporary measure to create the environment for sustainable peace, needs to assist in the establishment of domestic structures and mechanisms which<br />protect and promote human rights. As is manifest in the case of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), institution-building is becoming an integral part of peacekeeping.'<br />Chapter 7 considers the possibility of the use of force in protecting human rights. Given that the presence of UN peacekeepers did not succeed in protecting civilian lives either in Rwanda or Srebrenica (Bosnia-Herzegovina), we will examine the recent practice of the Security Council of contracting out enforcement operations to volunteering states. We will also consider the &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot;, unilateral or multilateral intervention by one or more states without any authorisation from the UN Security Council. The problem represents a deviation from collective security as envisaged in the UN Charter. Seeking the possibility that peace-keeping forces can contribute in protecting human rights through non-military means, the potential role of peacekeepers as a &quot;protecting power&quot; will be studied. The potential of peacekeepers to carry out human rights functions will also be discussed.ial role of peacekeepers as a &quot;protecting power&quot; will be studied.

This is the feeling one may get once alerted for it. Everyone is familiar with all kinds of biological rhythms ('biological clocks') that create some kind of conformity in time and in nature. This includes for instance neural activity and brain activity, but also the cardiac vascular system. Clearly, there are numerous other examples to be mentioned, sometimes much more controversial like the claimed synchronicity of the monthly period of nuns in a cloister, and so on.<br />Synchronous motion was probably first reported by Huygens (1673), where he describes an experiment of two (marine) pendulum clocks hanging on a light weighted beam, and which exhibit (anti-)frequency synchronization after a short period of time. Synchronized sound in nearby organ tubes was reported by Rayleigh in 1877, who observed similar effects for two electrically or mechanically connected tuning forks. In the last century synchronization received a lot of attention in the Russian scientific community since it was observed in balanced and rotors and vibro-exciters. Perhaps an enlightening potential new application for coordinated motion is in the use of hundreds of piezo-actuators in order to obtain a desired motion of a large/heavy mechanical set-up like for instance an airplane or Mm-scanner, or the coordination of microactuators for manipulation at very small scales.<br />In astronomy synchronization theory is used to explain the motion of celestial bodies, such as orbits and planetary resonances,  In biology, biochemistry and medicine many systems can be modelled as oscillatory or vibratory systems and those systems show a tendency towards synchronous behavior. Among evidences of synchronous behavior in the natural world, one can consider the chorusing of crickets, synchronous flash light in a group of fire-flies, and the metabolic synchronicity in yeast cell suspension.<br />The subject of synchronization has received huge attention in the last decades, in particular by biologists and physicists. This attention probably centers around one of the fundamental issues in science, namely curiosity: how come we find synchronous motion in a large ensemble of identical systems? Also, new avenues of potential use of synchronicity are now being explored.<br />Synchronization has much in common - and is in sense equivalent to-coordination and cooperation. In ancient times it was already understood that joint activity may enable to carry out tasks that are undoable for an individual.<br />The authors' interest in the subject of synchronization is strongly influenced by a desire to understand what the basic ingredients are when coordinated motion is required in an engineering system. We therefore have concentrated in this book on synchronization or coordination of mechanical systems, like in robotic systems. This allows to delve, on the one hand, in the theoretic foundations of synchronous motion, but, on the other hand, made it possible to combine the theoretical findings with experimental verification in our research laboratorium.<br />This book concentrates therefore on controlled synchronization of mechanical systems that are used in industry. In particular the book deals with robotic systems, which nowadays are common and important systems in production processes. However, the general ideas developed here can be extended to more general mechanical systems, such as mobile robots, ships, motors, microactuators, balanced and unbalanced rotors, vibro-exciters.<br />The book is organized as follows:<br />Chapter 1 gives a general introduction about synchronization, its definition and the different types of synchronization.<br />Chapter 2 presents some basic material and results on which the book is based. In Section 2.1 some mathematical tools and stability concepts used throughout the book are presented. The dynamic models of rigid and flexible joint robots are introduced in Section 2.2, including their most important properties.The experimental set-up that will be used in later chapters is introduced in Section 2.3, where a brief description of the robots and their dynamic models is presented.<br />Chapter 3 addresses the problem of external synchronization of rigid joint robots. The synchronization scheme formed by a feedback controller and model based observers is presented and a stability proof is developed.<br />Simulation and experimental results on one degree of freedom systems are included to show the applicability and performance of the proposed controller. The main contribution of this chapter is a gain tuning procedure that ensures synchronization of the interconnected robot systems.<br />The case of external synchronization for flexible joint robots is addressed in Chapter 4. The chapter starts by explaining the differences between rigid and flexible joint robots and the effects on the design of the synchronization scheme. The synchronization scheme for flexible joint robots and stability analysis is presented. The chapter includes a gain tuning procedure that guarantees synchronization of the interconnected robot systems. Simulation results on one degree of freedom systems are included to show the viability of the controller.<br />The problem of internal (mutual) synchronization of rigid robots is treated in Chapter 5. This chapter presents a general synchronization scheme for the case of mutual synchronization of rigid robots. The chapter includes a general procedure to choose the interconnections between the robots to guarantee synchronization of the multi-composed robot system. Simulation and experimental results on one degree of freedom systems are included to show the properties of the controller.<br />Chapter 6 presents a simulation and experimental study using two rigid robot manipulators and shows the applicability and performance of the synchronization schemes for rigid joint robots. Particular attention is given to practical problems that can be encountered at the moment of implementing the proposed synchronization schemes. The robots in the experimental setup have four degrees of freedom, such that the complexity in the implementation is higher than in the simulations and experiments included in Chapters 3 and 5.<br />Further extensions of the synchronization schemes designed here are discussed in Chapter 7. Some conclusions related to synchronization in general and robot synchronization in particular are presented in Chapter 8.set-up that will be used in later chapters is introduced in Section 2.3, where a brief description of the robots and their dynamic models is presented.<BR>Chapter 3 addresses the problem of external synchronization of rigid joint robots.

Janiskee, Ken Masugi (Rowman &amp; Littlefield) This collection has its origins in a scholarly conference and has been enhanced with more recent contributions. The Claremont Institute celebrated California's one hundred fiftieth anniversary of its birth by hosting &quot;Democracy in California: Sesquicentennial Reflections on Equality and Liberty in the Golden State,&quot; October 27-28, 2000. The editors of Nexus, the law and policy journal of the Chapman University School of Law, graciously offered an issue of their journal for the revised papers from the conference. Many of the articles in this volume first appeared in Nexus. We thank them for their generosity, especially editor-in-chief professor Hugh Hewitt, professor John Eastman, and managing editor Jeanette Lee.<br />The essays presented a political and legal history of the development of a Progressive regime and its conditions of freedom. To this end, the conference sought to emphasize the themes of political philosophers such as Aristotle and Alexis de Tocqueville and the statesmanship of Abraham Lincoln and thus help foster a new generation of scholarship on California. We later obtained the participation of not only established scholars of California but also others whose expertise would profitably be directed to California issues. Obviously, the essays could not cover every important element of its culture or politics, yet we hope nonetheless this collection might guide serious students in the way they study this vital state.<br />Often lauded as having the fifth (or sixth or seventh, depending on what measure one uses) largest economy in the world, California seems to lead the nation in other measures as well-particularly cultural and political trends. But were it an independent state, it would be one of the world's strangest democracies. Understanding this strangeness, this exoticism, was our task. Even before its national preeminence, and well before the staggering budget crisis, the need to understand California as a necessary part of understanding America was abundantly clear. In order to understand, to quote Abraham Lincoln, &quot;where we are and whither we are tending,&quot; we were forced to reexamine the political principles of the Compromise of 1850, of the early state constitutions, and of the American founding, just as we must keep in mind the mores and practices of American citizenship. The essays strive to make these connections and thus lead us to self-knowledge. They had been organized into four themes: the conditions of democratic statehood; Progressivism and its statesmen; mores, multiculturalism, and citizenship; and the future of Progressive democracy.minence, and well before the staggering budget crisis, the need to understand California as a necessary part of understanding America was abundantly clear.

First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk.	2004-03-24

A few words on the book's methodology are in order. The turn to finitude and contingency as fundamental conditions of existence, as well as the focus on the issue of human freedom, are features that reflect the author's commitment to approach ethics from what is best de-scribed as a Roman Catholic point of view. That is to say, it is deeply in-formed by Roman Catholicism's embrace of turning to nature and reason to make its case, from a perspective that is profoundly and foundationally shaped by the Christian story as told in the New Testament and by the Christian hope for humankind and redemption more generally. As such, it is a project that is meant to be open and persuasive to Christians and non-Christians alike, although the articulation of religious acceptance in the final chapter will of course resonate more with Christians.<br />But more is at stake than a specific point of view, however important that may be. The methodology itself was also chosen to help make progress beyond three perplexing difficulties for theologians and philosophers today, including the religious ethicist. The first is the problem of justifying any type of claim about what it is to be a human being that does not violate the particularity of each human being. Compounding this has been a problem especially relevant to the ethicist: the difficulty of making a case for the existence of human freedom, where the entire discipline in some way engages or depends on the need for human beings to make choices, and evaluate their choices, in the context of their lives. The long-standing and all-dominating view of the world as it is leaves little room for a theoretical grounding of freedom, and so philosophers and theologians alike have taken a variety of tacks to try to assume, evade, make compatible, or soften the significance of human freedom vis-&agrave;-vis determinism.<br />The description of finitude and contingency in the first chapter seeks to ad-dress the first problem, that of saying something about what it is to be human that is universally true to a practical extent without violating particularity.<br />The description in chapter 1 identifies finitude and contingency as conditions that are fundamental for human existence and therefore common to all, but since it is our finitude and contingency that give rise to our particularity, these conditions of existence seem good candidates for articulating what is universal while respecting what is particular.<br />The second problem is taken up in light of the answer to the first. That is, the very fact that our finitude and contingency create particular lives, lives that encounter particular choices, requires that the question of freedom be addressed. Because chapter 2 offers a new, more scientifically sound account than mechanistic determinism as an overarching view with room for freedom-a view, moreover, that also gains support from the very considerations of finitude and contingency explored in chapter 1-we may begin to think again about human persons as substantively free in a real sense. This means that we no longer need to restrict ourselves, theoretically at least, to thinking of human persons only `as if' they were free, or to constructing models for considering freedom in nonsubstantive ways. Yet if this makes it possible to speak of human persons as possessing some degree of freedom, it does so with the implication that freedom is had in a context where finitude and contingency profoundly shape our lives. This approach also recognizes that it is not possible to speak of human persons as free in an absolute sense. Freedom, to the extent that it exists, can beonly a matter of degree.<br />Making some progress on these two fronts, however, could leave us with a third problem, one common to an endeavor of this kind: abstraction. Having worked on the topics of finitude, contingency, and freedom for some time, the author is keenly aware of how easily abstract wanderings can bedevil such considerations. However, the methodology that risks creating this problem is also its antidote. Finitude and contingency are taken up precisely because these are features of concrete existence, and the issue of freedom must then be considered because it arises directly in relation to them. These features literally confront us as we live. Moreover, the decision to turn to literary analysis from an ethical point of view reflects not just a turn to a source of deep reflection and a presentation of experience, but also a commitment to keep the ethical analysis grounded, that is, consonant with the conditions of particular lives, the conditions under which all ethical action occurs.<br />This book seeks to move beyond the three problems noted above and clear the way for the development of a fruitful new approach that is philosophically sound, consistent with key Christian understandings, and productive of a concrete ethics that arises from a conception of the human person as finite, contingent, and free. The final chapter offers a specific approach to ethics that can assist us in understanding morality anew and in discerning how we are to act if we are indeed finite, contingent, and free. Admittedly, seeking to develop a way of understanding that avoids the three problems noted above and generates a new approach to ethics is an ambitious agenda. But the book is in-tended as a beginning, as a new way of asking questions about ethics, not as the answer to the ongoing ethical questions that life poses for us.of degree.<BR>Making some progress on these two fronts, however, could leave us with a third problem, one common to an endeavor of this kind: abstraction.

Were there no other reason, this alone would make the literary legacy of the Baptist Anne (Williams) Dutton (1692-1765) significant.<br />In 1731, Anne and her minister husband, Benjamin Dutton, settled in Great Gransden, Huntingdonshire. After Benjamin's death, Anne became known on both sides of the Atlantic primarily through her extensive writings, including tracts, treatises, poems, hymns, and letters.<br />Among her many correspondents were Howel Harris, Selina Hastings, William Seward, Phillip Doddridge, John Wesley, and George Whitefield. Harris believed God had entrusted her &quot;with a Talent of writing for Him.&quot; Whitefield, who helped promote and publish Anne's writings, commented upon meeting her that &quot;her conversation is as weighty as her letters?'<br />She wrestled with the question of whether it was &quot;biblical&quot; for a woman to be a writer of theological matters. But in a tract entitled &quot;A Letter to such of the Servants of Christ, who may have any scruple about the Lawfulness of Printing any thing written by a Woman&quot; (1743), she stated that she wrote not for herself but &quot;only the glory of God and the good of souls.&quot;<br />Dutton's writings impacted evangelical revival in England and America. Not since 1884 have any of her writings been readily available. Now extensive portions of her letters, her tracts and booklets, and her poetry and hymns are once again available.	2004-03-17

Lambrecht (Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Resurrection Revisited	Resurrection in the New Testament: Festschrift J. Lambrecht edited by Jan Lambrecht (Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium, 165: Peeters Publishing) In 1990 Professor Jan Lambrecht received the status of professor emeritus from the K.U. Leuven after having served as a member of the Department of Biblical Studies of the Faculty of Theology since 1969 and Dean of the Faculty since 1985. In 1991 he celebrated his 65th birth-day. To mark these two occasions, we invited his former and then cur-rent students to contribute to a modest Schiilerfestschrift in his honor. Their very positive response resulted in the publication in 1992 of &quot;Sharper than a two-edged sword&quot;. Essays in Honor of Professor Dr. Jan Lambrecht S.J. in a special double issue of Louvain Studies.<br />However, Professor Lambrecht's influence was not only on his students at K.U. Leuven. He has been for many years an active member of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas, a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, a regular contributor to the Colloquium Biblicum Lovaniense, an attendee at American SBL and CBA meetings, a respected author of scholarly exegetical writings as well as academic material directed to a wider audience and a sought-after retreat preacher. His concern to actualize the message of Scripture has been evident throughout his career.<br />After leaving Leuven, Professor Lambrecht taught at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome until 2001, when he was honored by the publication of a third volume of his collected essays, titled Collected Studies on Pauline Literature and on the Book of Revelation. Nevertheless, since the publication of the original Schulerfestschrift, we have had it in mind to attempt to honor him in a more extensive way, so on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 2001 we invited a number of scholars to contribute to a Festschrift in honor of that occasion and in celebration of his distinguished scholarly and pastoral career both before and since his retirement. Responses were received from his colleagues at K.U. Leuven and Rome, as well as many international scholars he has interacted with through the years, including some of his former doctoral students.<br />In seeking an appropriate theme for this volume, we wanted to take into account Professor Lambrecht's wide-ranging interests, which have included, but not been limited to, the Synoptic Gospels, the Pauline corpus, in particular 1 and 2 Corinthians, and the Book of Revelation. We decided on the topic of Resurrection in the New Testament because it was broad enough to include all these interests while allowing for inclusion of some material from other than a strictly exegetical perspective, and, as well, because<br />Professor Lambrecht's concern with questions related to resurrection is longstanding. In 1975 he entered the debate as to whether resurrection or exaltation was primary in New Testament christology'. In 1981 he published a collection of articles that deal with both the resurrection of Christ and of Christians', and since then he has returned to the topic several times, especially in his studies on 1 Corinthians 153 and on 2 Corinthians 54.<br />The first two articles in this volume discuss influences on the New Testament treatment of resurrection from the Greco-Roman (Dieter Zeller) and Jewish (Daniel J. Harrington) backgrounds. Henk Jan de Jonge considers visionary experiences of the Old Testament as an interpretive clue for understanding New Testament references to appearances. The articles by Martin Rese, Benoit Standaert, Otfried Hofius, and Gergely Juhasz deal with interpretive questions that range through several books of the New Testament and to varying degrees again bring into discussion previously debated issues. From this point, with the exception of the final two, the articles appear in canonical order. Adelbert Denaux and Wim J.C. Weren treat issues in Matthew, John Gillman in Luke-Acts, Maarten J.J. Menken and Thomas Soding in John, John J. Kilgallen and Florence Morgan Gillman in Acts, Veronica Koperski, Margaret E. Thrall, and Johan S. Vos in the Pauline letters in general, Morna D. Hooker and Eduard Lohse in Romans, Joel Delobel and Peter J. Tomson in 1 Corinthians, Frank J. Matera in 2 Corinthians, John Reumann in Philippians, Raymond F.

There is hardly a newscast or a newspaper that does not mention them on a daily basis. The issues range from the changing global climate to how those changes affect a nearly extinct owl in the forests of the western United States. Global climate change is a worldwide phenomenon, but concern on such as air quality in congested cities will differ greatly in Los Angeles and Mogadishu. Thus some responses to environmental problems need to be inter-national or national, while others will be highly localized.<br />The broad issues deal with our approach to the natural world. To what degree do we really understand it and the inter-actions of the various forces of nature? The decisions that we make are not abstract; rather they involve the underlying philosophies of different groups and religions. Are we to live with nature, or shall we dominate it and place it at our service? With either approach, or several others that are possible, the precise meaning of these concepts needs to be identified.<br />If nature is to be preserved, then the question of what is enough is instantly raised. Do minor species, about which, granted, we know very little, deserve to be taken into consideration? If we preserve large areas primarily for future recreation, how sacrosanct shall they be and when can they be considered for some development?<br />Economic considerations play a major role in all environmental decisions. Global issues bring about a conflict between the developed lands and those of the Third World. Can the latter develop without going through the polluting stages of industrialization? On the local level, there is always a price to be<br />paid for cleaner water and air or reduced levels of noise. The struggle between different economic groups is continuous and often quite bitter.<br />Human welfare is always at the core of the discussion, but the term has very different meanings for those who are well-off and those who are hungry. Shall food production, cheap transportation, and basic housing take priority over a declining infant mortality rate, longer life expectancy, and better medical care?<br />These questions have not been raised in a significant manner till the last half century. Some concerns were always expressed, but in a very limited and localized fashion. As major portions of the world remained unexplored, and relatively untouched by modern developments there was no need to deal with these issues till the latter part of the nineteenth century. Such questions are endless, and we know that the answers will determine the quality of life for future generations. As we seek answers, we naturally turn to our religious heritages. Each tradition has been asked the same questions by its adherents, and each faces some-what the same predicament.<br />Judaism has been no different from the other world religions. Our tradition dealt with small segments of these issues, but they were secondary or even peripheral to earlier generations. Although there is some isolated appreciation of the natural world and concern for it in the midrashic literature, the halakhic tradition has even less. As this latter tradition depends largely on questions asked, in other words on real-life situations rather than on speculation, little material is available as no one raised the issues or asked the questions.<br />This means that modern Judaism must build on a slim foundation of the few issues that have been raised and then look at the underlying principles to see what guidance may be given. This requires a major effort and new approaches. It may also require an entirely new and different outlook upon the natural world from what we followed in the past.<br />The essays in this volume seek to make a beginning in this direction. They wish to go beyond the hortatory rather vague approaches of others who have written about Judaism and the environment. We need an underlying philosophy and a halakhic approach that will develop into detailed guidance. Discussions on these issues is vital as questions on these matters continue to be raised with increasing urgency.<br />The Freehof Institute of Progressive Halakhah is a creative research center devoted to studying and defining the progressive character of the halakhah in accordance with the principles and theology of Reform Judaism. It seeks to establish the ideological basis of Progressive halakhah, and its application to daily life. The Institute fosters serious studies, and helps scholars in various parts of the world to work together for a common cause. It provides an ongoing forum through symposia and publications, including the quarterly newsletter Halakhah, published under the editorship of Walter Jacob, in the United States.

This book provides a clear and straightforward account of the development, doctrines, and practices of these faiths. The emphasis throughout is on the personal consciousness of believers and their own accounts of their religion and its relevance in contemporary life.<br />One of the unique features of this text is personal interviews with followers of each faith. This material provides interesting and informative first-person accounts of each religion as perceived from within the tradition. This volume includes special boxes featuring interviews with a Jewish holocaust survivor, a Southern Baptist Christian, who is now manager of a wilderness camp for inner-city youth, an Egyptian pharmacist, who returned to Islam because he learned to appreciate it from a scientific point of view, and a German follower of the Unification Movement. In addition, first-person accounts have been interwoven throughout the text.<br />Living Religions - Western Traditions also includes feature boxes on &quot;Religion in Public Life.&quot; These portray the spiritual roots of selected followers of Western religions each of whom is making a significant contribution to modern society-Senator Joseph Lieberman, Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, and Muslim scholar Farid Esack. In their stories, one recognizes that deep religiosity can go hand-in-hand with deep social commitment.<br />There are also feature boxes on &quot;Religion in Practice,&quot; such as Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity, and &quot;Teaching Stories,&quot; which can serve as take-off points for discussions about core values imbedded in each faith.<br />Violence perpetrated in the name of religion is often in the news these days. Living Religions: Western<br />Traditions includes probing discussions of this disturbing factor in the major Western religions and also in new religious movements. Distinctions are made between the basic teachings of religions, none of which condones wanton violence, and the ways in which religions have been politicized. There is extensive coverage of the socio-political context of the contemporary practice of religions, especially the changes that have come in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.<br />Throughout the book, women's contributions and women's issues are carefully considered. Women's voices are woven into the discussions throughout, including those of female theologians who are bringing vital new perspectives to religious scholarship. African and African-American religious experiences are also of increasing interest, and these are extensively covered in this volume. There are poignant descriptions, for instance, of the lives of American Muslim converts who are trying to maintain traditional piety in the midst of modern materialistic society.<br />The opening chapter, &quot;The Religious Response,&quot; brings critical scholarship to bear on underlying issues in the study of religion. Throughout the book the latest scholarship has been applied. The book incorporates extensive quotations from primary sources to give a direct perception of the thinking and flavor of each tradition. Particularly memorable brief quotations are set off in boxes.<br />One of the most engaging features of Living Religions: Western Traditions is its illustrations. 120 illustrations, 64 of them in color, helps to bring  the religions to life. Narrative captions accompanying the illustrations offer additional insights into the characteristics and orientation of each tradition and the people who practice it.<br />Each tradition is presented clearly and without the clutter of less important names and dates. Key terms, defined and highlighted in bold-face when they first appear, can also be found in an extensive glossary. Because students are often unfamiliar with terms from other cultures, useful guides to the pronunciation of words that may be unfamiliar are included in the glossary.<br />Maps are used throughout the text to give a sense of geographical reality to the historical discussions as well as to illustrate the present distribution of the religions. There is also a map of the missionary journeys undertaken by the apostle Paul in the chapter on Christianity. Timelines are used to recapitulate the historical development of the major religions up to the present.<br />Readers who want to delve further into the literature, there is, at the end of each chapter, an annotated list of books that might be particularly interesting and useful in a deeper study of that religion.tudents are often unfamiliar with terms from other cultures, useful guides to the pronunciation of words that may be unfamiliar are included in the glossary.<BR>Maps are used throughout the text to give a sense of geographical reality to the historical discussions as well as to illustrate the present distribution of the religions.

His background both as a professional horticulturalist and cultural geographer provides him with a unique orientation to understand and to interpret their relationship. In a wider sense, his perception opens our minds to the larger perspective of environmental appreciation motivating a much larger population<br />than the peakbaggers.<br />There is something about the mountain landscape which offers a never-ending fascination for humankind. The quest of mountain conquering clearly relates to something deeper and more spiritual. Tobin's concept of peakbagging as pilgrimage presents an explanatory device for understanding the Transcendental philosophy in a modern-day guise. Hopefully, it will mark the path for others to follow, investigating other aspects of the modern world's approach to Nature. While writing this book within the disciplinary framework of cultural geography, Tobin realized that an inquiry into mountain climbing would appeal to a wide range of students and scholars. The inquisitive mind in the disciplinary fields of not only cultural geography, but also American studies, history, Nature studies, outdoor recreation, and religious studies as well; can utilize the book as a means whereby to conduct further investigations identifying the scope of American Transcendentalism.<br />The fifty-four 14,000-foot mountains, or 14ers, are the focal points in the cultural geography of Colorado mountaineering. Since 1920, individual climbers known as 14ers peakbaggers have attempted to climb all of Colorado's 14ers. After ascending these mountains they become 14er Club members, a venerated group within the Colorado Mountain Club. Their personal narratives and literature indicate ties to American Transcendentalism, a religion promoted by Ralph Waldo Emerson. I developed two unique models, the Transect Model and the Transcendental Ziggurat Model, to assist in data retrieval and analysis of these writings. Incorporation of the two models reveals that the Colorado 14ers peakbaggers, by exhibiting Transcendental belief and pilgrimage activity, create a cultural geography supporting American Transcendental pilgrimage.<br />Though many Americans have been exposed to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson with American Transcendentalism widely diffused throughout American culture, it requires a specialized study of a particular population to identify the adherents of a religion relying on transcendental ideals. Simultaneously, a focus upon religious practitioners requires the identification of their actions. Pilgrimage, the spatial movement to a venerated object, enables us to identify American Transcendentalists due to the necessitated movement of practitioners. Consequently, solely observing a solitary or collective act of visible movement will not suffice for documentation of belief. As curious scholars attempt documentation of Nature belief systems, Tobin anticipates future queries with individualized models and approaches, similar to the ones found in this book, recording the voice of each American Transcendentalist.<br />The Transcendentalist philosophy has a surprising capacity to be reborn with succeeding generations. This is probably to be explained by its attractive reconciliation of the environment and the spiritual. Segments within each generation or so, seem to grasp its offerings intuitively often without totally recognizing them as guiding principles. Nevertheless, not even in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is Transcendentalism ultimately appreciated, or even widely recognized.ountains they become 14er Club members, a venerated group within the Colorado Mountain Club.

G. Davies (SCM Press, London 1972, 2nd ed. 1986), it is not merely a further edition of that work, but rather its successor. While the vast majority of the headings used in that earlier volume have been adopted here, some have been deleted, new ones added, and other subjects rearranged. For example, `experimental forms of worship' has been eliminated because it now seems an outdated category, and for a similar reason `feminist liturgical movement' subsumed within the wider category of `women and worship'; while entries referring to more recent developments, like `praise and worship movement', have been inserted. The broad entry on `liturgies' has been replaced by two separate entries, on `eucharist' and on `word, services of the'. In some cases entries have been placed under new headings that would be more commonly used today. Thus, for instance, `year, liturgical' has been substituted for `calendar'; `daily prayer' for `canonical hours'; `eucharistic prayer' for `anaphora'; `inculturation' for `indigenization'; and so on.<br />All entries have been entirely rewritten, and in nearly every case by a new contributor. Contributors have been chosen on the basis of their expertise in the particular subject, in some instances from within the particular worship tradition under discussion, in others from outside, since both views shed valuable and complementary light. All the entries, except the shortest, have been broken up into numbered sections with sub-headings for ease of use and provided with bibliographical resources for further study. Where appropriate, the literature listed has been divided into selected texts and studies, with works containing a more extensive bibliography indicated by the symbol (bib.). It is the editor's earnest hope that with these changes and improvements the volume will serve as a comprehensive guide to the subject for future years as well as Davies' work has done for the last thirty years.these changes and improvements the volume will serve as a comprehensive guide to the subject for future years as well as Davies' work has done for the last thirty years.	2003-12-23

Statements about what is good or bad, fair or unfair, legitimate or illegitimate, express axiomatic beliefs about human existence. The fact that values differ from culture to culture and century to century opens many questions for the student of values. How can differences be explained? Can some values be accepted as true and others false? Can the question of validity be ignored in favor of identification of the causes of belief? Thinkers from Adam Smith, Nietzsche, Durkheim, and Weber to John Rawls and Jurgen Habermas have developed theories, rooted in economics, psychology, or biology, to explain why people endorse or reject certain value statements. In The Origin of Values, Raymond Boudon offers empirical, data-based analysis of existing theories about values, while developing his own general perspective as to why people accept or reject value statements.<br />Boudon classifies the main theories of value including those based on firm belief, social or biological factors, and rational or utilitarian attitudes. He discusses the popular and widely influential Rational Choice Model, critiques the postmodernist approach, which sees all values as the emanation of singular cultures. Boudon investigates why relativism has become so powerful and contrasts it with the naturalism represented by the work of James Q. Wilson on moral sensibility. He follows with a constructive attempt to develop a new<br />theory, beginning with Weber's idea of non-instrumental rationality as the basis for a more complex idea of rationality.<br />Applying Boudon's own and existing theories of value to recent and current political issues and social ideas-the end of apartheid, the death penalty, multiculturalism, communitarianism---The Origin of Values is a significant work. Boudon fulfills a major task of social science: explanation of collective belief. His book will be of interest to sociologists, philosophers, psychologists, and political scientists.<br />About the Author<br />Raymond Boudon is professor at the University of Paris-Sorbonne (Paris IV).

Gregory Lande (Brassey's) describes the struggle of the medical and legal professions and the US. government to cope with insubordination, substance abuse, and crime in the Civil Warera military<br />During the American Civil War, as in all wars, soldiers were wounded not just physically but emotionally as well. Good men traumatized by the violence of war were sometimes driven to their mental limits, while criminals and troubled individuals who had joined the ranks of the citizen armies found themselves in a more rigid environment in which to commit their transgressions. In the Civil War military, justice was swift and harsh and forgiveness difficult to come by. Citing numerous period documents, Dr. Lande demonstrates that the scientific understanding of mental illness and substance abuse was in its infancy during the mid-nineteenth century. He chronicles cases in which soldiers' mental afflictions or problems with severe alcohol abuse contributed to their misconduct, soldiers such as Leroy Shear, a.k.a.. &quot;Lorenzo Stewart,&quot; whose arrest after deserting from two different Union units resulted in an even more serious crime.<br />Once charged with disobeying orders or committing a crime, soldiers faced an uncertain fate. While the requirements of military law have always differed from those of civilian law, Civil War troops did not have access to legal counsel unless they could afford to hire a lawyer themselves. The sad result was that many mentally ill, incompetent, and poor men were imprisoned for long periods or even put to death. Though a more sophisticated understanding of mental illness and substance abuse developed after the war in the emerging field of forensic psychiatry, it would take many years for American society to reform the treatment of those deemed &quot;criminally insane.&quot;<br />Madness, Malingering and Malfeasance shows that the effects of war unfolded in numerous compelling, tragic, and shocking events beyond the battlefield.

More specifically it examines situations where Western democracies, the United Nations, the OSCE and even the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have attempted to transform the media sector in third party states. By examining the legal and political context of the new interest in media before, during, and after conflict, the contributors make current trends more visible and illuminate the relationship between speech and force in international affairs.<br />Together the contributors consider how international law is changing to encompass, reflect, and channel intervention practices. They each from various academic, legal and diplomatic perspectives look at `information intervention' through the lens of human rights principles, especially those relating to restrictions on hate speech and the right to receive and impart information. They examine the distinctions between State-authorized and rogue uses of media to incite conflict; between authorized and unauthorized incidents of information intervention; and between preventive intervention as opposed to that directed towards resolving conflict. And they test some of the justifications that are articulated for different forms of information intervention, actions that range from mere monitoring of broadcasts to the total reformulation of media laws, and ultimately the seizure or bombing of transmitters, and full-blown cyberwarfare.	2003-07-30

True, such knowledge may not yield pure gold, but there might still be a few nuggets one can mine, specks of gold ore that can be used to enrich one's knowledge of human history and of human ideas. It is perhaps ironic that what Max Muller had observed in his &quot;Lecture on the Vedas&quot; became true of his own scholarship. For while he thought the Vedic hymns &quot;tedious, low, commonplace,&quot; he still believed that &quot;hidden in this rubbish there are precious stones.&quot; In the same way, one will find some &quot;precious stones&quot; hidden in the writings of Max Muller, but only if that person is willing to mine them.<br />Compiling an anthology of the essential writings of E Max Muller is no mean task. While the aim throughout was to include Muller's best-known and most often cited essays and addresses, page limitations have restricted the number of selections to fewer than twenty. As a result, those that have been included represent a mere sampling of his voluminous output, but a sampling, nevertheless, that presents to the reader the range of Muller's research interests in the origins of language, mythology, and religion. In addition, in view of Muller's wide-ranging interests in the comparative study of religion, mythology, folklore, linguistics, metaphysics, and human cognition, it is hoped that the selections in this &quot;essential Max Muller&quot; will be of interest to scholars and students in fields as diverse as religious studies, philosophy, anthropology, early linguistic theory, and the history of Western ideas.<br />There were a number of problems Stone encountered in editing this collection of essays that needs to be mentioned. The first has to do with the problem of multiple editions of and revisions to his catalogue of works. For instance, there are two published versions of Muller's famous 1870 &quot;Lectures on the Science of Religion,&quot; an original edition, first published in 1872 under the title Lectures on the Science of Religion, and an expanded edition, published in 1873, that Muller retitled Introduction to the Science of Religion (as a point of interest, the latter edition was dedicated to Ralph Waldo Emerson). Further complicating matters, each version ran through several printings in Britain and the United States. Worse still, with each printing, Muller suggested corrections and revisions. In absence, therefore, of a definitive edition, for the selection included in this current anthology, &quot;Lecture One,&quot; Stone decided to use the 1872 edition, which is closest to the actual lecture his audiences would have heard him give. It is shorter, &quot;edgier,&quot; and less circumspect than Muller's revised and expanded versions.<br />With respect to other essays in this anthology whose originals were not available to me, Stone  has had to content myself with using Muller's later and sometimes final versions, such as those essays he himself had selected for his Chips from a German Workshop, which by 1881 had grown from two to five volumes, as well as those he republished in his two volumes of Selected Essays (1881). Additionally, the three chapters from Muller's Lectures on the Origin and Growth ofReligion (1878) reprinted here are from his new edition, published in 1882. For this new edition, Muller updated some of his sources as well as tightened up his prose.<br />A second set of problems the editor encountered were numerous stylistic and mechanical incongruities. Muller was sometimes inconsistent in his spelling, in English transliterations of foreign words and phrases, and in his use of accent and stress marks. In addition, at least by modern standards, Muller made awkward use of commas, colons, and dashes and tended to write highly complex and overly long sentences and paragraphs. Many of the inconsistencies, of course, can be accounted for in the stylistic differences between his several Britishand American publishers. But his awkward use of punctuation was probably idiosyncratic. Though, for the reader's benefit, Stone has attempted to bring some consistency in both spelling and punctuation and have sought to reduce and simplify other res extraneae, in the end, it seemed inappropriate to &quot;restyle&quot; Muller's essays to fit modern tastes. For one thing, Stone did not want to dilute the nineteenth-century &quot;flavour&quot; of Muller's writings; and, for another thing, because a large amount of his published work had been written for lecture audiences, retaining most of the original accent and punctuation marks may preserve for the reader Muller's own speaking style; that is, it may allow the reader to &quot;hear&quot; his voice-which, according to contemporary reports was clear, passionate, erudite, and engaging. For instance, as Nirad Chaudhuri relates, after presenting a lecture on the Science of Language in the Council Chamber at which Queen Victoria and the royal family attended, Muller wrote to his wife that the Queen &quot;listened very attentively, and did not knit at all, though the work was brought.\\" When his lectures are read aloud, Muller's punctuation does indeed add variety to the pacing of his phrases and underscores their aural intensity. What is more, his indulgent use of commas and semicolons lends greater coherence to his long but carefully constructed sentences.ican publishers.

The leading idea of the book is that rituals are a autonomous form of expression of the human mind. The human mind expresses itself in rituals, as it does in language, the arts, and mathematics. Rituals are not performative translations of symbols and ideas, and in religion, of any kind of theology. Theology does not explain how rituals are done and how they accomplish what they claim to do.<br />The book begins with a general discussion of what rituals are, and argues that the ritual theory of each ritual is not in any general theory of ritual but embedded in the ritual act itself. Every ritual is structured in such a way that its details create the behavioural logic that makes ritual work. The difference is explored between the early and institutionalised phases of the religion of ancient Israel. Here the role of the economic ethos is the focus of the discussion. The book explores the links between myth and rituals, arguing that the connectedness with ritual endows a story with a myth essence. Detailed discussions of various rituals exemplify the major theoretical discourse.<br />The book is of interest to scholars in the areas of Halakhah (law and ritual), religious studies, and the anthropology of religion.	2003-07-02

Opdahl (Bucknell University Press) Emotion as Meaning offers a new model of the mind based upon a new understanding of emotion. It resolves the debate between the Imagists and propositionalists by tracing the translation of language into vicarious<br />experience, showing that the mind represents Its imagined world by means of not only image and idea but emotion. Emotion as Meaning surveys existing theories of mental representation and demonstrates its thesis by analyzing the mind's construction of several literary texts.<br />How does the reader of a novel (or a person remembering or daydreaming) construct that internal, imagined world that extends over time and seems to occupy a space of its own? Until twenty years ago, most believed that we imagine within the medium of language. Then psychologists like Allan Paivio and Stephen Kosslyn showed that we think also by means of Images, triggering a debate between the propositionalists, who define thought in terms of idea (or word), and the imagists, who insist we think in picture-like ways. Opdahl shows that emotion repesents elements that elude those two codes: relationships, intangible mental states, large entities like cities or eras, and-always context or background Emotion provides the primary mode of the identifying reader, as he or she shares the emotions of the protagonist Although the affective code is ignored today, it is natural and even inevitably-a process we know even if we are not aware of it Emotion is meaning because it represents first the significance of the object and then the qualities that create that significance: the object itself<br />Some readers will appreciate this book as an analysis of several novels or as a definition of an affective criticism, as it studies the function of emotion in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, John Updike's The Centaur, and Toni Monison's Beloved. Opdahl shows that an emotion criticism is practical, effective, and illuminating.<br />Other readers will appreciate this book as a survey of the literature on emotion and mental representation, noting its solution of a major problem. How freeze an otherwise fleeting emotion long enough to examine it? How make what is exquisitely private public? The answer lies in the work of literature, which stabilizes human emotion on the page, for all to see.<br />For all readers, however, the ultimate point must be the demonstrated existence of the affective code. Emotion not only gives voice to our feelings but stands for something other than itself: it is depictive as well as expressive, serving as an effective mode of thought. To understand this fact is to revise the currently accepted models of the mind, shared by aesthetic critics and cognitive scientists alike. It is also to understand the important contribution the humanities can make to our understanding of the processes of thought.and Toni Monison's Beloved.

Yet, clinicians facing the multiplicity of wishes, fantasies, and conflicts reported by their patients typically find a guiding focus on attachment security inadequate to the complexities of therapeutic work. How, asks Geoff Goodman in The Internal World and Attachment, can we progress further in integrating the fruits of attachment research with the accumulated clinical wisdom of psychoanalytic theorizing about the internal world of object representations? The key, he answers, is to look more closely at the basic assumptions of each body of theory, especially those assumptions, whether embedded or explicit, that bear on the formation of psychic structure.<br />Taking his cue from the contributions of Kernberg, Fonagy, Lieberman, Silverman, and others, Goodman argues that contemporary object relations theory, with its emphasis on object representations organized within a psychic structure, can be profitably integrated with attachment theory's Internal Working Models, with their emphasis on external reality and defensive exclusion. Drawing on Kernberg's insights into the affective and instinctual substrata of psychic organizations, Goodman proposes that insecure attachment categories can be correlated with particular constellations of self and object representations. Such convergences provide a springboard to further theoretical explorations, most especially to the relations between attachment and adult sexual behavior. Indeed, one outstanding feature of<br />Goodman's proposals is the light they cast on various forms and meanings of sexual psychopathology, as he delineates how both promiscuity and retreats from sexual intimacy can be differentially interpreted depending on the patient's pattern of attachment.<br />Destined to provoke lively debate, The Internal World and Attachment is a powerfully informative attempt to go beyond the researcher's view of attachment as a motivational system oriented principally to cues in the external world. For Goodman, attachment is informed by an internal logic that reflects fantasy and defense, and an appreciation of the interaction of attachment pattern with various constellations of self and object representations can deepen our understanding of the internal world in clinically consequential ways. Vividly reported case material drawn from work with adults, children, and mother-child pairs demonstrates Goodman's claims and underscores the clinically grounded nature of his integrative project. Keeping his eye resolutely on the clinical texture of attachment observations and the clinical phenomenology expressive of internal object relations, Goodman provides the reader with an experience-near basis for viewing two influential bodies of knowledge as complementary avenues for apprehending the internal meaning of externally observable behavior.ient's pattern of attachment.<br />Destined to provoke lively debate, The Internal World and Attachment is a powerfully informative attempt to go beyond the researcher's view of attachment as a motivational system oriented principally to cues in the external world.

Not only did Noailles create a distinctive voice in the world of French letters but her influence reached writers of both genders in France, in other European countries, and across the Atlantic. Best understood in terms of a Dionysian aesthetics, her work is sensual, erotic, and playful, but also reflective, violent on occasion, and always marked by a tragic undercurrent that becomes magnified with time. Beyond the prominent place she held in the world of French letters, Noailles' lifelong commitment to artistic creation invites a reconsideration of her work.<br />Through the focusing lens of Anna de Noailles, Persephone Unbound revives multiple facets of the culture in which she wrote. More crucially still, it reevaluates a writer whose historical stature and whose incorporation by the French establishment as a representative of \\"feminine\\" poetry have tended to overshadow her literary merits. With respect to her poetry in particular, critics have often failed to recognize the modernity of its lyric voice on account of its traditional verse patterns. Reflecting a dual attitude of competition and cooperation with her cultural world, Noailles held a similarly doublevoiced discourse toward conventional interpretations of woman. Her classification in literary history as a belated French Romantic further obfuscates the significance of her work While recognizing her predecessors, Noailles was frequently unable to find adequate models in their works for a distinct poetic identity. In seeking new versions of the feminine self she acknowledged women who were unable to write and, more broadly, she attempted to provide a formerly silent Muse with voice and presence. Noailles' Greek inheritance also enabled her to reclaim mythical figures such as those of Persephone and Antigone, and thus to invigorate the link that French poetry had established with antiquity. The book finther evaluates Noailles' unique positions on social-sexual politics as they find expression in her little-known relationship with the nationalist writer Maurice Barres. First made available to readers in 1991, their correspondence discloses how Barres found in Noailles a long-sought muse even while he rejected her progressive politics. The author analyzes both Noailles' renditions of this relationship and the oscillation in Barrbs's works between the symbolic significance he attached to Noailles as a quasi-miraculous incarnation of his fascination with Dionysian values and his equally forceful denial of a poet whose inspiration clashed with his philosophy of nationalist action.al interpretations of woman.

While there are no new concepts involved, the application of science, religion, intuition and logic together enabled the accomplishment of what could never have been achieved by such applied separately. More than seventy cases of living persons, many who are widely recognized today, are included in this work. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George W. Bush, Jesse Ventura, Oprah Winfrey, Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, John and Robert Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr., are among the reincarnated revolutionaries.<br />Here is a book that rests upon an all encompassing concept found in the world's great religions; that whatsoever a man shall sow, that shall he also reap. At the same time, it melts away the basis for racial prejudice and religious prejudice and makes irrational all the exclusive conditions that various religions impose upon their followers to ensure their salvation. It verifies the Golden Rule as Natural Law in operation.<br />Even more remarkably, it offers evidence that must transform our understanding of heredity. It provides a basis to recognize that our character traits, natural abilities, artistic talents and inclinations are not the product of fortunate or unfortunate combinations of genes but are entirely our own creation and are preexisting to any particular life that we have in the earth. This is an Ancient Wisdom teaching that has been on record through out all time. This understanding transforms the concept of DNA from its being the source of characteristics of the individual to its being the composite result of the thoughts and actions of the individual soul-entity down through the centuries.<br />How can a book about the reappearance by reincarnation of the Founding Fathers of America, the revolutionaries, possibly be associated with the foregoing statements?<br />Science is based upon probabilities. Computer science provides a basis to examine an hypothesized probability and correlate vast data to establish it as an aspect of Natural Law or dismiss it. The accurate preservation of physical appearances through photography, in combination with the computer's capacity for storing data and making vast accumulations of records instantly accessible, is the basis for the existence of this crucially important book. The combination of a brilliant mind, a lawyer's ability to build a sound case, a broad background of scholarship regarding the subject matter, an open mind and exceptional capacity for reasoning, in addition to his exceptionally developed sensitivity to respond to guidance by intuition, has enabled Dr. Semkiw to produce a book that has established the above statements as matters of Natural Law.<br />This is not to suggest that there is anything pedantic or tedious about the presentation of the material. It is fascinating reading and for many people it will be difficult to put this book down. The opening portion is devoted to information concerning how the author came to dedicate himself to write such a controversial work and to his over view of the subject of reincarnation. He does this astutely, presenting such in a highly readable manner. Then follows his perception that individuals return in bodies that are similar to those of their last appearance in the earth and how they are inclined to again associate in families and socially. He disarmingly describes his own reactions to learning of his identity as the return of President John Adams. By his forthright presentation of his thoughts, he becomes like a personal acquaintance to his reader.<br />It is a great adventure to be taken along with Doctor Semkiw as he unravels each of the cases of reincarnation. The implications of his findings are momentous for our civilization. The returned founders of our nation are now dedicated to restoring the ideals that it was founded upon and contributing to its spiritual awakening. Accurate knowledge of the Natural Laws governing our lives will provide the incentive for the most able, the most intelligent, the most ambitious, the most energetic, of our citizens to dedicate their lives to serve the best interest of their fellow man and posterity.<br />Joseph R.

The subject arises when noting that exorcism was an unconventional activity in Greco-Roman society during Christianity's early centuries. Despite this, by the middle of the third century of the Common Era, as we learn from a letter of Cornelius, Bishop of Rome, to Fabius, Bishop of Antioch, the church of Rome had &quot;fifty-two exorcists, readers and doorkeepers&quot; on its roster of 154 clergy. This letter raises the question of how a phenomenon held at the<br />periphery of conventional healing activity not only survived in the early church, but apparently flourished to make the transition from superstition to institution in the Greco-Roman world.<br />Within the context of the Christian scriptural background the logic behind exorcism's eventual institutionalization is understandable.' Jesus' own exorcistic activity as presented in the synoptic gospels, and his command to his disciples to do the same, grant to exorcism a place of consequence in early Christian tradition.' But it also makes it a subject with which the church would eventually have to come to terms in its missionary appeal to Greek and Roman audiences. The continuation of exorcism in the westward expansion of early Christianity is noteworthy because it appears to have survived in an environment that relegated its demonology and the human powers involved with it to a magical or an occult status rather than a cultic one. In Greece the charge of magic is brought against neither medical practitioners nor the activities of the Asclepius healing cult. On the one hand, doctors rarely claim to do the extraordinary, but follow instead a naturalistic therapy of diagnoses and prognoses based upon observed precedent. Even should they solicit divine powers in this process the method remains essentially unchanged. On the other hand, although the Asclepius cult claims to do the miraculous, it operates within a healing tradition whose authority is recognized by the state. The accusation of magic, then, rests not upon extraordinary activity per se, but ultimately upon the authority from which that activity is perceived to derive. This is echoed in the Palestinian setting for the synoptic portrayals of Jesus, where critics question Jesus' authority to heal, not his ability to do so.<br />Sorensen explores how exorcism also played a role in the process of conversion, as Christianity formally introduced itself to the host cultures of Greece and Rome. In order to argue the relevance of exorcism to Christian mission, one must make a case for either a change in Greek thought that led to its accommodation of the exorcist (Near Eastern influences on Greco-Roman thought and practice), or a change in the practice of exorcism that may have brought it more into synchronicity with the Greek world-view, or a synthesis of both. The issues of cultural adaptation will be discussed under five chapter headings. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss analogous practices from the ancient Near East that, although initially rejected in the biblical texts, gained a credibility during the intertestamental period that would add legitimacy to the portrayals of exorcism in subsequent Judaism and early Christianity. Chapter 4 discusses the Greek cultural background that undermined this legitimacy. Chapter 5 discusses the various uses of exorcism in the New Testament that would have facilitated its adaptation in the early centuries of Christian expansion. Chapter 6 discusses the actual reception of the Christian exorcist as it can be gathered from the literary sources, to determine where changes may have taken place either in the Christian practice of exorcism to accommodate the sensibilities of the audience to be converted, or in the world-view of the audience that the exorcist hoped to convert. The present study's time frame for early Christianity extends from the first to the early fourth centuries of the Common Era. The closing terminus reflects Constantine's favorable recognition of Christianity, and assumes that the acceptance or tolerance of Christianity that followed thereafter would have affected the contemporary perceptions of its traditions, exorcism included.the early fourth centuries of the Common Era.

In Hegel: A Feminist Revision, Hutchings examines the philosophical connections and debates between Hegelian thought and feminist philosophy. However, Hutchings does not simply to catalogue ways in which Hegel figures in different feminist philosophical arguments. Instead Hutchings demonstrates that Hegel's thought has something to contribute to significant philosophical arguments within feminism over sexual difference, epistemology and moral and political theory. The fulfilment of claim clearly requires both the articulation of a particular perspective within feminist philosophy and a specific interpretation of Hegel's thought. Feminist philosophy is not a uniform body of thought and my characterization of feminist debates will reflect a perspective which some feminist philosophers would want to reject. Similarly, Hutchings' interpretation of Hegel is a contestable, left-Hegelian one with which other feminist philosophers and Hegelian scholars will find plent to contest This means that the persuasiveness of any of the arguments in Hegel: A Feminist Revision depends on the extent to which readers recognize and identify with the kind of feminist philosophy and the kind of Hegelian philosophy that Hutchings articulates and defends. It should be clear from the outset, however, that Hutchings  does not argue that Hegel himself was in any sense a feminist. It is patently obvious from his own remarks on sexual difference that, even in the context of his own time, Hegel's attitude to women was patriarchal and at times misogynist. If Hegel's work is useful to feminist philosophers it is in spit of his own ideological position on the `woman question'.<br />Hegel famously complained of the inability of Prefaces or Introductions to accomplish the intellectual journey on which a book is designed to take a reader. In line with this complaint, in this review one can only assert the main claims about feminist philosophy and Hegel. The heart of the argument is the claim that Hegel is battling with the same conceptual conundrum that constitute debates in feminist philosophy. Central is the conundrum of how to escape the conceptual binary oppositions (between culture and nature, reason and emotion, autonomy and heteronomy, universal and particular, ideal and real) which have associated women with the denigrated term and prescribed the exclusion of women from the practices of both philosophy and politics. As Hutchings expoundas it, feminist philosophy can be defined as a project to think the world differently, but one which is forever prey to a tendency to lapse back into the terms it is seeking to transcend. This is particularly clear in debates internal to feminist philosophy, in which the difficulty of \\"thinking differently\\" becomes apparent in feminist characterizations of opposing positions. Hutchings argues that Hegel prefigures the reductive pattern of internal philosophical debates within feminism in his account of the temptations of modern thought to lapse into onesidedness and exclusivity in his Phenomenology of Spirit and Science of Logic. In addition, Hutchings argues that Hegel provides a resource for resisting the temptations of modernist transcendence, through his insistence on the inseparability of being from truth and his historicization of both being and truth. Having made this argument, Hutchings puts forth an account of its implications for feminist ontology, epistemology and moral and political theory. The later part of the book attempts to show how a Hegelian feminism would respond to contemporary feminist debates about knowledge, morality and politics.l journey on which a book is designed to take a reader.

In this study Leib Moscovitz systematically surveys the development and impact of abstraction and conceptualization in the various legal corpora of rabbinic literature, illustrating the critical and unique role that conceptualization plays in talmudic reasoning. He demonstrates how; the analysis of rabbinic conceptualization can shed light on numerous important aspects of rabbinic scholarship, such as the character and development of rabbinic legal thought, techniques of rabbinic legal exegesis, rabbinic jurisprudence, and various philological and historical issues in rabbinics, such as the chronology of the anonymous stratum of the Babylonian Talmud.<br />Rabbinic conceptualization, though unique in many respects, shares certain features with cognate disciplines, and this study utilizes these disciplines (mainly jurisprudence, cognitive psychology, and philosophy) to illuminate rabbinic conceptualization wherever relevant. The themes addressed in this study, include the use of casuistics, generalization, and implicit conceptualization in the earlier strata of rabbinic literature, classification and legal definition, legal fictions, legal explanation, analogy and association, and the development and use of explicit legal concepts and principles in the later strata of rabbinic literature.	2003-04-09

The first is the rapidly increasing breakdown of the long-accepted paradigm for interpreting Plato along developmental schemes that rests on a broad division of the dialogues into \\"early\\" (and \\"Socratic\\"), \\"middle,\\" and \\"late.\\" There is growing disaffection with many of the assumptions that sustained this paradigm, such as, for example, the ability to isolate a \\"Socratic\\" phase of Plato's thought, or the usefulness of the chronology of composition to establish the development of that thought. Indeed, the whole idea of a developmental interpretation of Plato's ideas has perhaps lost much of its allure, not least in view of increased attention to ancient interpretations of Plato that do not invoke development. But while the established paradigm-which, of course, many have always resisted-is losing its hold, no generally accepted alternative has emerged to replace it. Rather, the reverse: any disinterested observer, surveying current books and periodical articles on Plato, might easily gain an overwhelming impression of fragmentation--even if the survey restricted itself to publications in English. (There have long been significant differences, within the modern period, between the types of approach to Plato adopted within different cultural traditions, whether in English-speaking counries, in Europe at large, or in Latin America; the present tendency toward \\"fragmentation,\\" if such it is, is a new phenomenon, belonging chiefly to those areas in which English is the first language.)<br />The second major change which lay behind the original idea for the Colloquium was the gradual emergence of a new debate between philosophers and classicists about the relationship between form and argument in the Platonic corpus. This debate is informed to some degree by currents in modern literary theory, which have helped to produce an increased sensitivity to the problems and possibilities of interpreting the highly complex and elusive set of texts contained in the Platonic corpus. But it too increasingly recognizes the relevance of ancient approaches to Plato (and to Socrates) and their potential usefulness to modern interpreters, especially in offering perspectives and preoccupations different from our own.<br />Seven speakers were invited to address some aspect of these problems. Each invited presentation also had a respondent who presented critical comments and context to the remarks of the principle speaker. After presentation and a recording of comments from the floor the essays were reworked and reordered for presentation in this volume.:<br />Julia Annas's (with Dorothea Frede responding) investigation of how should we categorize the \\"middle\\" and \\"late\\" periods, acts as an introduction to the essays. Middle period in the Platonic corpus used to mean \\"optimistic,\\" \\"constructive,\\" while \\"late\\" meant \\"critical\\"; but that seems to depend too heavily on a particular reading of Parmenides. Certainly, some dialogues must have been written \\"in the middle,\\" between those written earlier and those written later, but that by itself obviously carries no implication for our interpretation of them. Have we perhaps gone on using categories whose justification has actually been forgotten, and indeed lost?<br />Next David Sedley (with David Blank responding) comments on the Ancient Platonic perspectives on Socratic irony. Academic skepticism, Middle and NeoPlatonism all contribute to images Socratic irony which contracts significantly with modern philosophical interpretations.. What do these ancient interpreters have to offer us, if anything? One position thatis widely held, at least by implication, is that anything which makes Plato look less like a modern academic philosopher will simply make him look less like a philosopher. If, then, we are (modern) philosophers, we had better go on interpreting him as one-and ignoring the Neo-Platonists, at any rate, whose Plato is often about as far from the model of a modern philosopher as it is possible to be. Is there anywhere to go beyond this position? Is it inevitable that we reject later Platonist interpretation, or does such interpretation, however alien it may seem to be, have something of value for us?<br />Christopher Taylor (with Brad Inwood responding) comments upon the modern origins of our present paradigms. At what point, and precisely why, did \\"Socrates\\" begin to be separated off from \\"Plato\\" in the interpretation of Plato? (In one sense, perhaps, with Aristotle; but the particular notion that one group of dialogues is essentially Socratic is a modern one. Who invented it, and why?) When did scholars of Plato first begin systematically to detect, or assume, a difference between \\"middle\\" and \\"late\\"?<br />Charles Kahn's (with Charles Griswold. Jr. responding) offers a summary of Platonic chronology. What are the grounds for supposing that knowing when a particular dialogue was written (if we could know it), whether absolutely or in relation to other dialogues, should significantly affect our understanding of it? Kahn provides an adroit reading of the historical approaches that have given us the developmental perspective.<br />Christopher Gill (with Kathryn Morgan responding) looks at the dialogue form and the nature of dialectics. Is there any such thing as \\"the\\" dialogue form? Discussion has usually centered on the \\"Socratic\\" dialogues, treating the rest as a kind of falling-off from the real thing-the real dialogue; but is Laws, for example, written as it is-as a conversation-merely, as it were, out of habit? Do we have anything to learn from ancient reactions to Plato as a literary artist?<br />Terry Penner (with Christopher Rowe responding examines the philosophical implications of \\"Socratic\\" dialogues How distinct are they from the \\"middle\\" and \\"late\\" ones? Some reconstructions of the \\"Socratic\\" positions allegedly contained in these dialogues suggest that they are more or less interestingly different; on the other hand, different forms of unitarianism do not seem obviously silly, and there are some indications that Plato thinks the methods we see deployed in the \\"Socratic\\" dialogues are compatible with those deployed in the \\"middle\\" and \\"late\\" period. Is the notion of \\"Socratic\\" dialogues ultimately tenable or useful?<br />Andrea Nightingale (with R.B.

If, then, we are (modern) philosophers, we had better go on interpreting him as one-and ignoring the Neo-Platonists, at any rate, whose Plato is often about as far from the model of a modern philosopher as it is possible to be.

Throughout the Old Testament there has been no more popular name, no more beloved biblical figure, no greater icon than King David. Through the millennia he has been portrayed as a pious and humble man, a goodly king whose heart was with the Lord, a monarch who composed lyrical poetry, divine music, defeated a giant and warded off the enemies of the ancient Israelites.<br />The Sins of King David creates a different and altogether fascinating and thrilling portrait of the man. Gary Greenberg shows King David for what he really was-deceitful and corrupt, a tyrant and a murderer. From the slaughter of seven sons of Saul, whom he hung, and the death of Goliath, whom he did not slay, to the murder of one of his most loyal lieutenants, whose wife he seduced, he was not the man that history has embraced.<br />Follow King David and his subjects, successors and usurpers on a fantastic journey of discovery, and trace this unusual story through the written clues unearthed in one of the most holy texts.<br />The Bible offers two contradictory stories of David, one written by his allies, and the other by his adversaries. Only in the last century have scholars belonging to the Literary-Critical school of biblical analysis taken a fresh look at those conflicting stories, attempting to unravel the written skeins that weave through the biblical texts. This book is the fruit of those scholars' works, and the author's own endeavor, in which he attempts to portray David as the people of his time saw him and actually knew him.	2003-02-13

Ibn Arabi, edited by Michel Chodkiewicz, new introduction by James W. Morris, English translations by William Chittick and James W. Morris (Pir Press) Perhaps no mystic in the history of the world has delved as deeply into the inner knowledge that informs our being as did Ibn 'Arabi. He was born into the cultural and religious crucible of Andalusian Spain in 1165, a place and time in which Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars learned from each other and from the Greek classics that were then being translated and circulated. Drawing from the most advanced philosophical and metaphysical thinking of his time and from his extensive knowledge of the religion of Islam, Ibn Arabi created an extraordinary mystical theosophy that essentially sprang from his own spiritual realization into the divine unity of existence. Because of the advanced nature of his teachings, he has been known for 800 years as the Sheikh al Akbar, or the Greatest Master. Because of the subtlety of his language and complexity of his thought, access to Ibn Arabi has always been difficult and translation daunting. Previously only short extracts were available in English. This volume, the first of two, contains 22 key chapters of Al-Futuhat al-Makkiya, an encyclopedic Sufi \\"summa mystica,\\" on such issues as Ibn Arabi's doctrine of the Divine Names, the nature of spiritual experience, the end of time, the resurrection and the stages of the path that lead to sanctity.<br />Al-Futuhat al-Makkiya soars beyond time, culture and any particular form of religion. Describing what is fundamental to our humanity, it is astonishingly universal. Finally, readers in the West have a pioneering entree into one of the most important, profound works of world literature.<br />Any work on the Al-Futuhat al-Makkiya in English is provisional and exploratory and it will require several generations of scholars and some further development in philosophical hermeneutics before anything like a coordinated complete translation could yet be attempted. The importance of this work, and its future volume two that will include English translations of the French from the original 1988 French edition, is that it inaugurated the first systematic exploration in the West of this profound theosophical encyclopedia.  As a result, the years since the first appearance of these translations have seen an ongoing worldwide transformation- in the Islamic world at least as much as in Western academic and spiritual circles in the understanding and appreciation of the nature and wider significance of Ibn 'Arabi's writings. When ibn `Arabi's thought is more fully explored and more widely known its unique contribution to a future global religious plurality and harmony may become apparent. Ibn `Arabi proposes unique formulations of divine reality which when understood in depth may radically transform world theological discourse, not only in Islam but also in liberal and conservative Christian and Jewish hermeneutics.<br />Pir Press is to be commended in re-issuing this important selection of chapters from the gargantuan Al-Futuhat al-Makkiya because the French edition of 1988 its size, cost and foreign publication made access difficult in the English speaking world from the start, soon became utterly difficult to get to due to problems at the original publishers. Generally, for the past decade, only those with ready contact to university libraries and Islamic research collections have been able to refer directly to these essential translations. The translators have gone on to provide significant studies and translations of ibn `Arabi's work as Morris summarizes in his new introduction to this partial reprint edition. The second volume should include Chodkiewicz's original long Introduction to the key themes and opening chapters of the Al-Futuhat al-Makkiya, as well as outlines the contents and location, in the overall scheme of theFutuhat and translations of both the original French chapters.

Though widely studied, his views<br />on Important philosophical issues remain unexplored. p'Bitek's importance was in linking poetry and everyday living to philosophy and his insistence on the inseparability of any genuine philosophy from a specific context of socially constructed meaning. Much contemporary discussion in African philosophy would benefit from further exploring this linkage. Although the focus of this book remains throughout on p'Bitek's work, there are strands of p'Bitek's themes that are echoed in contemporary philosophical writing in Africa that merit examination.<br />Chapter 1 explores the question of the ever changing idea of Africa. From the multiplicity of visions of Africanity, we can begin to build consensus regarding the enduring elements. p'Bitek's songs preview V Y. Mudimbe's lament about European inventions of Africa. The coming together of European and African cultures raises crucial questions for Africanity. Four visions are compared to explore the multiple meanings of African identity. To explore the complexity posed by the diversity in Africa and the African experience, p'Bitek's assumption about the importance of blackness and African origin to Africanity is examined. I find p'Bitek's vision somewhat impoverished and suggest an alternative that is more flexible and that allows the telling of a multilevel story of Africa.<br />Chapter 2 explores the differing assumptions of what constitutes the philosophical and the religious and indeed whether such a dichotomy is appropriate in the African context. The abstract orientation in Western philosophy is contrasted with the narrative African bent. One of the themes of discussion is the different set of assumptions adopted by, on the one hand, African theologians such as John S. Mbiti and Bolaji Idowu and, on the other, by philosophers such as Paulin Hountondj i, Kwasi Wiredu, and Tsenay Serequeberhan. The history of Western philosophy is sketched with a view to finding openings for cross disciplinary dialogue.<br />A characteristic of p'Bitek's songs is that they are composed primarily to be sung out loud and performed, and only later did he translate and write them. This characteristic frames the discussion for chapter 3. Are the songs suitable vehicles for transmitting rigorous, intellectual discourse? How does one resolve issues of author(ity) and ownership of oral traditions? A discussion of the imagined benefits of written over oral texts provides an opening for rethinking the notion of what constitutes a text.<br />Chapter 4 examines the issue of whether depictions of women, strangers, and \\"others\\" within oral traditions marginalize these groups. Are oral traditions misogynistic? This question of whether the assumptions that marginalize women are deeply rooted in oral traditions is a crucial one in light of the underrepresentation of women in academic African philosophy and the political mainstream.<br />p'Bitek's passion, Africans religions, forms the theme of chapter 5. If religion is the most important aspects of a people's culture, it is crucial that this aspect be understood as the people themselves practice it. One of the key areas of interaction between Europe and Africa was religion and the work of missionaries and their African accomplices. The discussion in this chapter is mainly about the interaction of Christian missionaries with African religions. The chapter ends with a criticism of p'Bitek for failing to grasp the centrality of Islam to the lives of many Africans.<br />Whenever different cultures interact, a familiar problem arises. Chapter 6 poses the problem of the search for equivalent concepts across cultures and languages. If languages are not comparable in terms of their vocabulary and concepts, how do interested parties transmit important concepts across the languages? The discussion is indeed one aboutwhether the determination of \\"important\\" concepts is culturally or linguistically dependent. The implications of this problem are explored. What are the cultural universals and particulars? The possibility of understanding other cultures and other societies lies at the heart of the question. The implications for positions that extol uniqueness, such as negritude and Afrocentrism, are also discussed.<br />Chapter 7 takes up again an aspect of the discussion of African understandings of the self. The discussion here is about the place of the individual in society. The body of work that shows Africans to privilege community over individual is examined. In particular, Julius Nyerere's Ujamaa, Kwame Nkrumah's \\"African personality,\\" and Leopold Sedar Senghor's negritude are contrasted with the work of philosophers such as Ifeanyi Menkiti and Kwame Gyekye.<br />\\"What ought I to do?\\" is the guiding question of chapter 8. The task ahead is seen differently by African scholars. p'Bitek's view is discussed side by side with Frantz Fanon's call for revolution. Africa, despite its current problems, is indeed full of possibilities. There are many paths open to her future. Taking seriously the need to articulate African solutions to African problems, this chapter compares scholars who exhibit a creative resourcefulness in synthesizing and understanding African history with those that expertly ape Western theories and solutions. p'Bitek's challenge that the African scholar and philosopher must engage with African ideas and experiences forms the basis of the discussion.determination of \\"important\\" concepts is culturally or linguistically dependent.

Jewish Worship in Philo of Alexandria by Jutta Leonhardt (Texts and Studies in Ancient Judaism, 84: Mohr Siebeck) Leonhardt's focus attempts to move Philo back to the center of the Jewish cult life of Alexandria.<br />Jewish Worship in Philo of Alexandria describes the approach to worship of Philo of Alexandria as a knowledgeable contemporary of the later Second Temple and his view of the essence of Jewish worship. It includes discussions of his views on the Jewish festivals, especially the Sabbath, on prayer, psalms, hymns, praise and thanksgiving, and on Temple offerings, sacrifices and purification rites. Philo accepted and participated in Jewish worship and even knew about details of various Jewish traditions of his time. His writings, however, do not refer to them directly and cannot easily be used to reconstruct Jewish rituals of his time. His main aim is to discuss the rites as presented in the Mosaic Torah, which are binding for all Jews. These laws are frequently presented using the terminology of pagan cults and interpreted with recourse to Greek philosophy. In this philosophical description of actual rites there are parallels to Plato's references to religion<br />The Greek term for worship as a special term for Jewish worship was introduced by the Septuagint. Philo follows its use closely, applying it specifically for Jewish worship as fear and love of God (Dt. 10), but he also mirrors the use of the term in Greek culture, which comprises a variety of activities. Its use is similar to the Hebrew idea, and includes prayer, dedication (both included in worship), sacrifice, and rituals (including purification). But Philo adds consistently and at a prominent place in the lists of rites another aspect, the festivals. Festivals were also extremely important in the pagan Greek world. For the pagans they were mainly an occasion and opportunity for other acts of worship, especially for sacrifices. For the Jews, however, and especially for the Diaspora Jews, there was one particular festival that had a deeper importance, beyond the sacrifices and rituals offered on the day: the Sabbath. On this day they rest, meet and read the Torah to the present day. The Sabbath was  and still is  one of the main features of Judaism. Already in antiquity it was recognized by non Jews, and Philo's view of the Sabbath as link between God, the creation, and the Jewish people in particular, suggests that it was the importance of the Sabbath that prompted him to include references to the festivals whenever he mentions specific aspects of sacrifice.  This demonstrated that, even when he writes as a Hellenistic writer in the classical style, Philo is deeply immersed in and influenced by his Jewish tradition.<br />This is in the following discussion of worship. Most terms are taken from Philo's use of the term; thus chapter Two studies the festivals, i.e. Philo's use of worship and especially the Sabbath, chapter Three describes prayer and chapter Four the Temple offerings, sacrifices and purification.<br />The Greek term for worship can be used to describe  any number of rites, so that a choice must be made to limit the terms studied here. The basic structure is given by the above mentioned terms derived from Philo's use of worship. But in chapter Three the inclusion of two sub chapters was necessary, one on psalms and praise singing, and one on thanksgiving. The reason for this is that in the texts on worship Philo consistently reserves some terms for human addressing God. These, however, have two meanings: in one sense they are most general terms for prayer, \\"als umfassendster Ausdruck far die Anrufung der Gottheit\\", comprising the manifold aspects of communication with God; and in this general sense Philo uses the terms in the above mentioned passages on prayer as address. But it is shown that in a more specific sense they refer more often to the aspect of supplication (part of which is the vow). Therefore, in addition to a study of address, acts of praise as a vow more emphasis on praise is included as an act of joy. Any reference to praise in the Jewish context must consider the aspect of psalm recitation and singing, as the Old Testament associates praise with singings, and thanksgiving, as the fulfillment of supplications is another important aspect of communication with the deity. In the present context a comprehensive study of every aspect of prayer is offered, but the more general points are discussed to further illustrate Philo's idea of prayer.<br />Thus the description starts with the festivals and prayer, aspects of worship which were not only practiced in the Temple but which Philo experienced in one way or another in Alexandria, then it moves on to the Temple tax which was brought there, and the overview ends with the Temple sacrifices and the purification rites connected with the Temple. Every aspect of worship has links to the Temple; therefore, several passages are studied more than once and from different angles. But as the Temple, unlike prayer, the Sabbath, and the synagogue, did not form part of Philo's everyday life, this study starts with the general and moves to the particular aspects of worship. In chapter Five the different strands are drawn together, outlined and interpreted the way in which Philo understood Jewish worship as a whole in the context of Greek and Jewish parallels.praise as a vow more emphasis on praise is included as an act of joy.

This study considers who these women were, their social status, the sources of their wealth and their motives for acting as they did, in addition to examining the various buildings, tombs and artefacts that they chose to spend their money on and the practical details involved. Questions are raised concerning the nature of female patronage as well as the means by which their aims were achieved. Focusing on the activities of women from different social strata as patrons of a range of artistic enterprises has revealed much, not only about their artistic intentions, but also about their individual piety, interests and concerns, and about the cultural and social context of their lives.<br />Surviving buildings, tombs, manuscripts and seal impressions provide the evidence on which this investigation has been based, together with relevant wills, documents and contemporary texts. The period chosen, from the accession of Henry III in 1216 to the death of Edward III in 1377, has provided an opportunity to assess the evolving impact of religious and social developments over several generations on the women concerned with artistic patronage.<br />Medieval culture was intensely visual. Although this has long been recognised by art historians and by enthusiasts for particular media, there has been little attempt to study social display as a subject in its own right, although display goes directly to the heart of the values, aspirations and, indeed, anxieties of past societies.<br />Contents: MAURICE KEEN Introduction; DAVID CROUCH The Historian, Lineage and Heraldry, 1050 1250; PETER CROSS Knighthood, Heraldry and Social Exclusion in Edwardian England; CAROLINE SHENTON Edward III and the Symbol of the Leopard; ADRIAN AILES Heraldry in Medieval England: Symbols of  Politics and Propaganda; FREDERIQUE LACHAUD Dress and Social Status in England before the  Sumptuary Laws; MARIAN CAMPBELL Medieval Founders' Relics: Royal and Episcopal Patronage at Oxford and Cambridge Colleges; BRIAN & MOIRA GITTOS Motivation and Choice: The Selection of Medieval Secular Effigies; NIGEL SAUL Bold as Brass: Secular Display in English Medieval Brasses;<br />FIONN PILBROW The Knights of the Bath: Dubbing to Knighthood in Lancastrian and Yorkist England; CAROLINE BARRON Chivalry, Pageantry and Merchant Culture in Medieval London; JOHN WATTS Looking for the State in Later Medieval Englandganda; FREDERIQUE LACHAUD Dress and Social Status in England before the  Sumptuary Laws; MARIAN CAMPBELL Medieval Founders' Relics: Royal and Episcopal Patronage at Oxford and Cambridge Colleges; BRIAN & MOIRA GITTOS Motivation and Choice: The Selection of Medieval Secular Effigies; NIGEL SAUL Bold as Brass: Secular Display in English Medieval Brasses; <BR>FIONN PILBROW The Knights of the Bath: Dubbing to Knighthood in Lancastrian and Yorkist England; CAROLINE BARRON Chivalry, Pageantry and Merchant Culture in Medieval London; JOHN WATTS Looking for the State in Later Medieval England	2002-08-13

Useful, but needs to be read carefully.<br />In the course of more than 30 years as a missionary among the people of India, Abbe Dubois found ample opportunity to observe and record Hindu practices. His first manuscript on Hindu religion and sociology, written in French, was completed in 1806. This comprehensive, annotated translation of Dubois's 1815 thorough revision of his work was completed by Henry K. Beauchamp in 1897 and revised in 1905.

Rosenkrantz (Exploring the Philosophy of Religion: Blackwell) (PAPERBACK)<br />Written with a clear presentation of the basic arguments of a rational justification of the idea of God. The Divine Attributes is excellent: thoughtful and systematic work that has an unusual clarity and intellectual rigor. It enables the reader to understand the attributes  omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, eternality, etc.  that make up the dominant idea of God in Western civilization.<br />The Divine Attributes is an engaging analysis of the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam from the perspective of rational theology. An ambitious study that rationally explores the nature of God, differentiates the idea of God from other historical ideas of the divine, and identifies the core qualities of a maximally great, or perfect, being. It includes detailed discussions of the fundamental divine attributes, such as divine power, knowledge, and goodness. It also addresses whether God is to be understood as eternal, within or outside of time, existing necessarily or contingently and whether God is to be understood as a physical or a spiritual substance.<br />In The Divine Attributes the authors analyze the idea of God (understood as a maximally great being). This exercise belongs to a philosophical discipline known as rational theology. In developing their analysis, they go through the following stages; (i) describing the nature of rational theology, (ii) differentiating the idea of a maximally great being from other historical ideas of the divine (and identifying the core great making qualities of a maximally great being), (iii) defending the coherence of maximal greatness and the mutual coherence of the divine attributes it includes, and (iv) elucidating those divine attributes.<br />They contrast various historical ideas of the divine with the idea of a maximally great being. The key great making qualities of a maximally great being are identified.<br />The divine person is traditionally thought to be concrete and substantial (though not corporeal). They elucidate these ideas by analyzing the concrete/abstract distinction and the concept of substance.<br />According to traditional theology, God is soul (a purely spiritual being). They clarify the notion of a soul, and argue that a soul cannot literally be omnipresent. It has been charged that the notion of a soul is unintelligible, and similarly, that body soul interaction is impossible. They answer these charges. Finally, they argue that there is a sense in which a soul must be simple.<br />God is said to be a \\"necessary being,\\" that is, a being that exists in every possible world. They elucidate the notion of a necessary being and in so doing will assess competing accounts of possible worlds. It is sometimes thought that God is a \\"self existent being,\\" that is, a being whose existence is explained by itself. They argue that this notion of self existence is incoherent.<br />The orthodox view is that God exists outside of time. They dispute this view, arguing instead that God is temporal and mutable (but nonetheless incorruptible).<br />They develop an analysis of omniscience (understood as maximal knowledge) and examine its implications for the nature of God. Their analysis implies that if an omniscient being foreknows the occurrence of a contingent event, then this event is causally determined. As we shall see, our analysis implies that God would not foreknow the occurrence of human actions that are free in the libertarian sense. We will discuss the implications of this analysis for the problem of divine foreknowledge and human freedom.<br />What are the implications of God's moral perfection for the character of what God creates? They attempt to advance our understanding of these implications by describing the moral principles or rules that guide the actions of a maximally great being. We will also attempt to resolve an alleged paradox that claims that moral perfection is incompatible with moral admirability.<br />The divine attribute of omnipotence seems puzzling, even paradoxical, to many philosophers. They wonder, for example, whether God can create a spherical cube, or make a stone so massive that God cannot move it. They defend the consistency of omnipotence (understood as maximal power). As a part of this defense, They analyze omnipotence and examine the implications of this analysis for the nature of God. At the end of this book, the authors provide an overview of the prospects for justified belief in the existence of a maximally great being from the perspective of rational theology.laims that moral perfection is incompatible with moral admirability.<br />The divine attribute of omnipotence seems puzzling, even paradoxical, to many philosophers.

N. Middleton (Ashgate) This book explores and evaluates evolutionarily theism  which asserts that God subject to change as humanity is subject to, change  charting the way it surfaces as a theme in classic, modern, and postmodern forms of creative writing philosophical theology, and cultural theoryv. Probing texts by process thinkers such as Whitehead, Bergson, Teilhard, and Hartshorne, as well as the literary of figures such as Aeschylus, Byron, Goethe, Greene, Joyce, Kazantzak Levertov, and Shakespeare, the twelve scholars in this volume reflect on God and the world, on reading and interpretation, and on being and becoming. The contributors emerge with fresh perspectives that promise to make a substantial contribution to the field of literature and religion today.<br />Although it is true to say that the field of literature and theology is growing and becoming more sophisticated and articulate, it is equally correct to say that few scholars working in the particular area of process studies have explored the potentially fruitful exchange between process thought and creative writing. A routine search of the library at the Center for Process Studies in Claremont, California, reveals very little; in fact, only a handful of articles and book chapters exist. Having said this, the researcher who digs beneath the surface of literary art  classic, modern and postmodern  uncovers a treasure trove of items, a fecund series of resources for thinking theologically in a relational world. Consider the English novelist David Lodge. One of Lodge's most engaging characters, Bernard Walsh, is a selfproclaimed agnostic theologian, who has a professional interest in Paradise. But, having come to Hawaii to escort his reluctant father Jack to the deathbed of Jack's estranged sister, he does not, like his fellow tourists, hope for a heavenly holiday. Here is Bernard's opinion of, and challenge to, process theology, culled from Lodge's 1991 novel, Paradise News:<br />Bernard sat at his desk and took out his notes on a book about process theology he was reviewing for Eschatological Review. The God of process theology, he read, is the cosmic lover. `His transcendence is in His sheer faithfulness to Himself in love, in His inexhaustibility as lover, and in His capacity for endless adaptation to circumstances in which His love may be active.' Really? Who says? The theologian says. And who cares, apart from other theologians? Not the people choosing their holidays from the travel agent's brochures. Not the drivers of the car transporters. It often seemed to Bernard that the discourse of much modem radical theology was just as implausible and unfounded as the orthodoxy it had displaced, but nobody had noticed because nobody read it except those with a professional stake in its continuation. God, Literature and Process Thought outlines and promotes the novel view that there is much to be gained when those who value the insights of process thought `encounter' the many and varied writers of literature and literary theory, and vice versa, and it celebrates process poesis, a fresh way of reflecting theologically and philosophically that takes account of literary forms, and which promises to transform creatively the very structure of process thought today.<br />In the last two decades, scholars have written some important books and a substantial number of essays on process thought and science, economics, spirituality, psychology, and theology, Christian as well as Jewish, but a book devoted to the alliance between process thought and literature has not been written or published. God, Literature and Process Thought seeks to correct this oversight. It does this by providing, in one volume, an instructive tool for studying a variety of process thinkers in conversation with numerous literary theorists and artists. Our book is divided into three parts. In Part I, four scholars reflect on the dynamic interplay that occurs when process thought and literary theory are brought together in a creative nexus of sorts. In Part II, seven writers attempt to serve as fairminded arbiters of a lively exchange between various process thinkers (Whitehead, Bergson, Teilhard and Hartshorne) and numerous creative writers (Aeschylus, Blake, Byron, Coleridge, Goethe, Greene, Joyce, Kazantzakis, Levertov, Schelling and Shakespeare). Finally, in Part III, one writer with training in process theology offers her own poetic reflections on the processes of reality, thereby suggesting that our anthology is capable of embodying the very thing it celebrates: process poesis.occurs when process thought and literary theory are brought together in a creative nexus of sorts.

Such a person was Confucius.<br />The similarities continue. Although all three were literate, perhaps all highly so, neither Confucius, nor Jesus, nor Socrates left behind any of his own writings. We know each only through the later writings of his admirers and detractors. In addition, each had a distinctive, charismatic, and complex personality. These three common features have made each the object of love, hatred, admiration, denigration, and debate for over two millennia.<br />Though Confucius is referred to in a variety of early Chinese texts, one of our most important sources of information about him is the Analects, a collection of sayings, brief discussions, and observations by and about Confucius, his disciples, and his contemporaries. Despite its great importance, prior to this volume there has never been a collection of secondary essays in English on the Analects. This volume is a collection of essays on the Analects, and on Confucius as seen (primarily) in that classic.<br />For the last two millennia, most scholars (whether Eastern or Western) have taken all twenty &quot;books&quot; of the Analects as an accurate record of what Confucius and his disciples have said. But scholarship in recent centuries has become more suspicious, investigating such issues as the historical composition of the text of the Analects and the sectarian motives behind various conceptions of Confucius. Consequently, the essays in this anthology are loosely grouped into two sections (based on an aphorism from Analects 2:11: &quot;One who can keep warm the old, yet appreciate the new, is fit to be a teacher&quot;). &quot;Keeping Warm the Old&quot; consists of essays that do not call into question the view that the received text of the Analects represents a coherent worldview. In contrast, the essays in &quot;Appreciating the New&quot; either call into question the integrity of the received text of the Analeces, or explore aspects of the image of Confucius that have been neglected by some of the dominant interpretive traditions.<br />Why has Confucius been, and why does he continue to be, such a source of fascination? One easy answer is that he has been a symbol for a variety of different (and often contrasting) things: meritocracy, aristocracy, traditionalism, rationalism, aestheticism, &quot;feudalism,&quot; secularism, wisdom, ignorance, Chinese culture, virtue, hypocrisy, and &quot;the Orient.&quot; On this explanation, Confucius is almost a cipher that functions to mediate our interest in other ideas and institutions. This explanation is not completely inadequate. All of us, at our worst, reduce Confucius to the father figure we either love or love to hate. However, I am enough of a traditionalist to believe that there is something about genuine classics that draws us to them, again and again, independently of accidents of historical association or privileging. Some texts and thinkers touch on central aspects of human life in a way that is elusive, yet unendingly evocative.

Though his individual works have often been classified according to the dominant medium in which they have been executed, his unrestricted movements among the arts of sketching, watercolor, printmaking, and poetry demonstrate his disregard of the conventional aesthetic parameters that are thought to separate one medium from another. Though Blake is just as unapologetic in trespassing the boundaries between here and the hereafter, most who celebrate the principle of free?play in his art squirm at his professed practice of the same principle in his life. His alleged sightings of spirits have by and large embarrassed his admirers, many of whom have chosen to look the other way. Blake's liberal experiments in mediumship, nevertheless, raise an intriguing question: is there a correlation between his textual and his spiritualistic practices? This study offers an answer.<br />In Knight of the Living Dead, Lundeen investigates Blake's work in the context of his spiritualistic practices, and shows how he attempts to create a discourse that circumvents the binary of natural and arbitrary signs. Her examination of his word?image art demonstrates that, in Blake's view, what we recognize as word or image depends upon our epistemological orientation, just as what we term &quot;matter&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; is determined by our state of perception. It further shows how Blake critiques textual theory in both his songs and prophecies by stabilizing the two sets of parameters that are used to define and classify signs: the general and particular, and the literal and figurative. Moreover, she argues, Blake provides an epistemological alternative to empiricism and rationalism in his poetry and art. Through verbal and visual experiments he defies the logic that is rooted in sense perception and reason, and he attempts through those experiments to return textuality to a divinely literal condition. By treating spiritualism as an aesthetic practice and art as an otherworldly communication, he undermines the institutionalized boundaries in art and life, and presents a formidable challenge to the whole matter/spirit dualism upon which Western culture is based.<br />An Excerpt from Knight of the Living Dead: We see just how closely affiliated the verbal and spiritual realms were to Blake in his memorable comment to Crabb Robinson: &quot;I write . . . when commanded by the spirits and the moment I have written I see the words fly abot [sic] the room in all directions?It is then published &amp; the Spirits can read.&quot; It is common enough for an artist to claim that his work is aided by spiritual intervention of one sort or another, but to suggest that one's art is directed toward otherworldly beings leaves earthly readers in a predicament. How are we to respond to art for which we have been deemed by the artist ontologically unfit? Blake's lifelong problem of getting his work published might in part be due to his choice of readership. Writing for spirits may demonstrate one's artistic range, but it is somewhat imprudent from a business standpoint ....<br />Though I will not presume to reconstruct Blake's interpretive community, it might be closer to home than we realize. Heaven, to Blake, was a mode of perception=`tho it appears Without it is Within / In your Imagination&quot;?and archangels, those who sympathized with his artistic endeavors .... [In a letter] he writes, &quot;You O Dear Flaxman are a Sublime Archangel My Friend &amp; Companion from Eternity.&quot; Such a rhetorical gesture mitigates the mysticism of his remarks about spiritual beings, but those remarks cannot be dismissed as mere hyperbole. The celestial referents in his writing are neither wholly literal nor wholly figurative. His language cannot be situated on the familiar tropological axis since his perception does not synchronize with a dualistic metaphysics. To Blake, the archangel Flaxman was as otherworldly as the archangel Gabriel was tangible since he regarded matter and spirit, not as polar realities but as different states of perception.perception does not synchronize with a dualistic metaphysics.

A.E. Taylor is a true guide to what Plato actually says and provides useful classical context that will keep out the most egregious error. This is an essential volume in any philosopher's library.<br />One of the greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato instigated groundbreaking inquiries into morality, ethics, and the quest for happiness that continue to inform and influence philosophical discussion today. In this outstanding work of scholarship, a renowned expert on Plato presents a scrupulously accurate historical view of the great philosopher's life and works. Distinguished by its dispassionate scholarly analysis, Professor Taylor's discourse is refreshingly free of the biases that have frequently tainted other studies.<br />A brief introductory chapter acquaints readers with the known events of Plato's life. The author then proceeds to an illuminating examination of the philosopher's voluminous writings, including the minor Socratic dialogues, as well as such major works as Phaedo, Symposium, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedrus, Timaeus, Laws, and other influential dialogues. The final chapter, \\"Plato in the Academy,\\" attempts to pin down?with the help of some of Plato's former students, such as Aristotle the philosopher's beliefs about numbers. In a substantial appendix, \\"The Platonic Apocrypha,\\" Professor Taylor examines writings that have sometimes been attributed to Plato, including several letters, and offers cogent reasons for accepting or rejecting them as Plato's work.<br />Praised by Dean William R. Inge of Theology as \\"a great book, an honour to . . . British scholarship,\\" this volume is an invaluable guide for students, teachers, and other readers interested in philosophy.	2002-06-17

Museum attendance is steadily on the rise; galleries devoted to the art of our times and the art of the past are flourishing; and there are probably more artists of note today than at any other point in the history of humankind. In New York alone, it has been estimated that there are some 60,000 practicing artists. As the contemporary painter and sculptor Frank Stella noted recently, with some astonishment, &quot;Until now, there weren't even 60,000 artists since the beginning of time.&quot;<br />Ours is also an increasingly visual culture, more and more dependent on signs and images instead of the written text. Television sets flicker for part of the day in most households; we cruise the Internet, encountering new forms of visual stimulus; our public spaces are littered with ever?larger billboards and neon advertisements. What a pleasure it is, then, to walk into a gallery or museum, into the relative sanity and quiet, where the eye can feast on images by artists long?gone or of the moment. And small wonder we are curious about the people who made these images, so many of which?like Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Rodin's Thinker, or the woodblock prints of the eighteenthcentury Japanese masters?have become instantly recognizable as touchstones of our cultural past.<br />When I was a high school student, thirty?some years ago, there was no comprehensive volume that offered easily accessible information on art and artists. The standard references were H. W. Janson's History of Art and E. H. Gombrich's The Story of Art, both excellent books and still fortunately very much in use. Janson's text is now in its sixth edition, published 2001; the sixteenth edition of The Story ofArtwas published in 1995. Neither, however, is in an encyclopedic form, and each has its biases. Gombrich, for instance, offers scant discussion of photography, which in the last 150 years has gained sufficient respectability as an art form to merit museum departments and prestigious exhibitions. Like Gombrich, Janson's history takes a European perspective that does not convey the sweep of Asian or African art. Nor was there a reference that handily defined the many terms that the average student (or adult!) reader runs across in discussions of art?contrapposto, sfumato, impasto, cuneiform, apse, caryatid, and the like. One had to work with a glossary at the back or keep a dictionary of art terms within easy reach.<br />Because of the growth of interest in art history, scholars have started to reassess traditional ways of thinking about art and culture. What was once called &quot;primitive&quot; art is more carefully studied and weighed; the contributions of men and women outside the Western mainstream are increasingly recognized; and little?known artists and schools of art are steadily being evaluated and re?evaluated. Without losing perspective on what makes some artists great and many more worth the acquaintance, the contributors and editors of the Schirmer Encyclopedia of Art have kept abreast of new findings and incorporated them herein.<br />In addition to offering sophisticated and up?to?date information for the older student and the general reader, the Schirmer Encyclopedia of Art was designed to present information in an approachable A to Z format. The nearly 300 biographies focus on the kinds of facts and anecdotes that will be of interest to young and questing minds, while over 100 topical articles cover eras, movements, and genres.

From acupuncture and chiropractic treatment to homeopathy and nutritional supplements, &quot;CAM&quot; therapies are widely accepted by much of the public but frowned upon by most physicians and researchers practicing orthodox medicine. In The Role of Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine, fourteen scholars from the fields of medicine, philosophy, sociology, and cultural and folklore studies examine the clash between growing public support and the hostility of clinicians and medical researchers.<br />At the center of the debate over complementary and alternative medicine is how to measure scientifically the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Proponents and critics have different methodologies and standards of evidence, thus raising the question of how much pluralism is acceptable in a medical context. Implicit in the debate is a deep conflict over differing worldviews and a struggle to define medicine in the modern age. The contributors' essays fall into two major categories: those addressing the methodological problems of assessment and those focusing on the differing cultural perspectives at work in a patient's choice of treatment. While all the contributors are sympathetic to CAM, they offer careful critiques of its claims. They suggest a variety of ways that it can both be taken seriously and subjected to careful scrutiny.<br />Written for medical practitioners and researchers and scholars of medical issues, this book offers a rigorous yet balanced evaluation of the meaning and value of alternative therapies.	2002-04-23

Enlightenment, this discourse claims, is neither a goal to be achieved nor a potential to be realized but the true status of all things. Every animate and inanimate object manifests the primordially enlightened Buddha just as it is. Seen in its true aspect, every activity of daily life?eating, sleeping, even one's deluded thinking?is the Buddha's conduct. Emerging from within the powerful Tendai school, ideas of original enlightenment were appropriated by a number of Buddhist traditions and influenced nascent theories about the kami (local deities) as well as medieval aesthetics and the literary and performing arts.<br />Scholars and commentators have long recognized the historical importance of original enlightenment thought but differ heatedly over how it is to be understood. Some tout it as the pinnacle of the Buddhist philosophy of absolute nondualism. Others claim to find in it the paradigmatic expression of a timeless Japanese spirituality. According to other readings, it represents a dangerous antinomianism that undermined observance of moral precepts, precipitated a decline in Buddhist scholarship, and denied the need for religious discipline. Still others denounce it as an authoritarian ideology that, by sacralizing the given order, has in effect legitimized hierarchy and discriminative social practices. Often the acceptance or rejection of original enlightenment thought is seen as the fault line along which traditional Buddhist institutions are to be differentiated from the new Buddhist movements (Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren) that arose during Japan's medieval period.<br />Jacqueline Stone's groundbreaking study moves beyond the treatment of the original enlightenment doctrine as abstract philosophy to explore its historical dimension. Drawing on a wealth of medieval primary sources and modern Japanese scholarship, it places this discourse in its ritual, institutional, and social contexts, illuminating its importance to the maintenance of traditions of lineage and the secret transmission of knowledge that characterized medieval Japanese elite culture. It sheds new light on interpretive strategies employed in premodern Japanese Buddhist texts, an area that hitherto has received little attention. Through these and other lines of investigation, Stone problematizes entrenched notions of \\"corruption\\" in the medieval Buddhist establishment. Using the examples of Tendai and Nichiren Buddhism and their interactions throughout the medieval period, she calls into question both overly facile distinctions between \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" Buddhism and the long?standing scholarly assumptions that have perpetuated them. This study marks a significant contribution to ongoing debates over definitions of Buddhism in the Kamakura era (1185-1333) , long regarded as a formative period in Japanese religion and culture. Stone argues that \\"original enlightenment thought\\" represents a substantial rethinking of Buddhist enlightenment that cuts across the distinction between \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" institutions and was particularly characteristic of the medieval period.ightenment thought is seen as the fault line along which traditional Buddhist institutions are to be differentiated from the new Buddhist movements (Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren) that arose during Japan's medieval period.<BR>Jacqueline Stone's groundbreaking study moves beyond the treatment of the original enlightenment doctrine as abstract philosophy to explore its historical dimension.

Wollheim is well conversant with the philosophical issues while bringing a depth and expertise to the appreciation of the art and craft of painting within both broad historical contexts and the minutiae of a particular artist and this unique painting.  So that what he says about any painting becomes a phantasmagoria of informed facts and conjectures that is a marvel approaching Keats' truth, beauty; beauty, truth.  Wollheim's interpretations are intrepid corrections of received wisdom and well-argued virtuoso interpretations. His scientist's appreciation of the subtle effects of perception blends well with an informed style; not an easy read, but one likely to educate one's sensibilities anew.	2002-02-28

Preventive mechanisms have also emerged and continue to gain ground at the national level.<br />These new realities, however, seem to have received little attention by the academic community. Yet they raise many important issues, which need to be further explored. The above considerations prompted the Marangopoulos Foundation for Human Rights to mark its twentieth anniversary by organizing an International Colloquy on the topic of the prevention of human rights violations.<br />The present Volume contains contributions by the participants, based on the reports they presented at the Colloquy, substantially revised and updated. It constitutes the first attempt at a systematic analysis of the subject of the prevention of human rights violations, focusing on the following five aspects: conventional regimes, non-conventional monitoring mechanisms, international commissioners and Ombudsmen, national Ombudsmen and human rights institutions and the development of a human rights culture. It closes with a theoretical synthesis of the various approaches to the prevention of human rights violations, focusing on the context, the concept and function, as well as methods and techniques of prevention.	2002-02-27

During the past fifty years there have been spectacular advances in our knowledge of how that system works and it seems possible that it might provide explanations for a range of musical phenomena. This book begins by discussing the early evolution of simple `western' tonal music; what exactly were the characteristics of the intervals and scales which hearing selected? It then considers problems such as what hearing has selected as instrumental tone, and why we have such a peculiar assessment of loudness; why is that independent of pitch, and why is hearing so sensitive to time? Does the mechanism of hearing determine our pitch discrimination, which differs so much across our hearing range? Amongst other things, this discussion leads to the conclusion that the harmonics of musical sounds, which are the basis of so much theory about music, did not and cannot play the role which has been so widely attributed to them ever since the work of Helmholtz in 1870.<br />There follows a simplified account of the hearing mechanism: how musical sound is coded by the ear, the nature of the processing stations through which the information passes before it creates sensation in the cortex, and the extent to which it provides answers to the questions which have been raised. This produces a rather different view of the basis of<br />some fundamental features of music from those which are commonly held. It also leads to the conclusion that music started with primitive instruments rather than with the human voice. Finally, the biological reasons for the hearing mechanism behaving as it does are explained, and thus the reasons for the sensations of music being experienced in the way they are.<br />No scientific knowledge is assumed; any simple physical acoustics required is explained, and there are no mathematical equations.	2002-02-13

The text is designed to meet a new and relatively unique niche in the neurosciences. The first two chapters provide the basic neural and physiological foundations for the remaining chapters. The text then continues by focusing on the neurological processes associated with each sensory modality. Although the emphasis is on the neurological aspects of each sensory system, perception is not disregarded. Perceptual processes are introduced and discussed from a neurological perspective. A unique aspect of the text is the inclusion of anomalies and dysfunctions for each sensory modality. In addition, a Glossary provides definitions for each highlighted term or concept discussed in the chapters. Given this approach, the content of the book is most likely to attract individuals interested in neuroscience, psychology, and biology. Sensory Processes, however, also recommends itself to those in other disciplines (anthropology, pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, pre-veterinarian)<br />For over three decades Soderquist taught graduate and undergraduate courses in psychology. Although the courses have varied in their depth of presentation, content, and titles (Introductory Psychology, Perception, Sensation and Perception, Sensory Processes, Biological Psychology, Auditory Perception, Animal Psychophysics), they all focused on or emphasized particular perceptual aspects of human and animal existence. Because perception is one of the major intellectual pursuits of psychologists, it is well recognized that \\"There is nothing that is in the intellect that is not first in the senses\\" (Blaise Pascal).	2002-02-05

Specifically Odin examines the notion of beauty as a function of psychic distance in Western and Japanese aesthetics, including both the philosophical and the literary traditions. On the Western side Odin underscores the notion of artistic detachment that developed from the revolution in aesthetics initiated by Kant's much celebrated (as well as much criticized) idea of beauty as a function of disinterested contemplation. On the Eastern side Odin highlights the Japanese notion of beauty as hidden depths apprehended through artistic detachment, a concept developed both in traditional Zen aestheticism and its reformulation in the Kyoto school of modern Japanese philosophy. Insofar as representative philosophers in the Kyoto school adopt an East?West comparative framework rooted in a Japanese Buddhist metaphysics of nothingness, they set forth a theory of disinterested aesthetic contemplation that synthesizes elements from both the Kantian and Zen Buddhist traditions. In addition, Odin clarifies how artistic detachment has been developed as a central motif in &quot;portrait?of?the?artist&quot; novels in Japanese and Western traditions of literary aestheticism. Portrait?of?the?artist novels in both traditions articulate a detachment theory of art in which beauty is a function of an act of disinterested contemplation. Moreover, the artistic detachment motif is related to plot and character development insofar as the protagonist is typically a young artist who cultivates heightened aesthetic consciousness through disinterested contemplation to the point of extreme alienation. Moreover, artistic detachment is built into the structure of an impartial narrative that records satori?like epiphanies, or haiku moments of sudden illumination, whereby the hidden depths of ordinary events are disclosed through acts of disinterested contemplation. Ultimately the goal of portrait?of?the?artist novels in both Japanese and Western literature is transmutation of life into art through psychic distance.<br />Implicit in the schematization of both Eastern and Western ideas about disinterestedness is the contemplative basis inherent in the Hindu, Chinese and Japanese Buddhist views and even the nature of German Pietism is not far removed from Kant. Yet as much as this practical contemplation approach to cultivating consciousness that is non-egocentric and hence \\"objective\\" Odin does not explicitly develop his theses in this direction. Rather he considers the literary reflections as for instance the fundamental tensions that emerge in such novels between what has been characterized in Ivory Towers and the Sacred Founts by Maurcie Beebe as representing the oppositional Apollonian/Dionysian impulses of detachment versus sympathy, distance versus involvement, disinterestedness versus participation.<br />Odin concludes that beauty is not just the fixed and given property of an object but requires an &quot;aesthetic attitude&quot; of disinterested contemplation. Against various criticisms leveled against aesthetic attitude theories, Odin emphasizes that artistic detachment is not exclusive of its opposite, namely, interest, feeling, desire, sympathy, or passion. Unlike renunciation, which rejects both desires and their objects, artistic detachment neither accepts nor rejects desires but instead objectifies and observes them. Again, disinterested contemplation of beauty does not mean that one is &quot;uninterested&quot; in the object. It simply means that one enjoys beauty for its own sake apart from concerns for self?interest. Whereas &quot;uninterested&quot; means bored, &quot;disinterested&quot; means impartial. The attitude of artistic detachment is not an anaesthesia, apatheia, indifference, or insensitivity but a heightened state of embodied intersensory awareness that maximizes both clear observation and affective feeling. For this reason cultivation of an aesthetic attitude of artistic detachment is widely regarded as the prerequisite of the connoisseur who fully enjoys the exquisite refined sensations of immediate experience. Furthermore, the aesthetic attitude includes both a negative or inhibitory phase of detachment and a positive or creative phase of imaginative reconstruction. A complete description of the aesthetic attitude of artistic contemplation therefore includes not only elements of disinterestedness, distancing, or detachment but also intense emotional sympathy and creative imagination. Thus the perception of beauty as hidden depths requires an aesthetic attitude including at least three interactive aspects-detachment, feeling, and imagination unified in an act of psychic integration.or insensitivity but a heightened state of embodied intersensory awareness that maximizes both clear observation and affective feeling.

In recent years there has been an extended debate about Enlightenment thought. Though many scholars have concluded that there were several &quot;Enlightenments,&quot; some continue to make generalizations about the Enlightenment and some speak about &quot;the Enlightenment agenda.&quot; After discussing the cult of the deathbed scene in eighteenth?century Britain and France, the author looks at three currents of Enlightenment thought implicit in the deathbed &quot;projects&quot; of David Hume, Samuel Johnson, and Jean Paul Marat. Although Hume and Johnson hold profoundly different views of religion, their political thinking has much in common. Their reformist thought differs radically from what might be called the transformist thought of Marat, who hoped the French would become disinterested citizens whose civil religion was patriotism.<br />The book also looks at the response of James Boswell, Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, and Edward Gibbon to the deathbed projects of Hume and Johnson, and it discusses how their political thought differs from Johnson's and Hume's. It also considers the complex relations between reformist and transformist thought in Britain during the last three decades of the century, showing how the views of the two reformist groups and of such transformist writers as Richard Price, Joseph Priestley, and Thomas Paine were affected by a number of political events, from the Wilkes crisis to the French Revolution. Though the book focuses on AngloScottish Enlightenment thought, it often refers to the French Enlightenment, and the chapter on Marat looks at the connection between transformist thought in Britain and France.<br />The author argues that Enlightenment thought was more varied and?in its reformist currents?less hostile to tradition than many observers have allowed. Enlightenment thought was less a cluster of ideas than a debate about a number of questions, especially the following: how to contain religious and secular fanaticism (or what was called enthusiasm); what are the effects of luxury; and what is the nature of the passions. There was, as J. G. A. Pocock says, &quot;a family of Enlightenments,&quot; and &quot;there is room for the recognition of family quarrels...&quot;<br />Why look at deathbed scenes to chart the currents of Enlightenment thought? Because an interest in deathbed scenes was widespread in eighteenth?century Britain and France. The final days of Hume stirred up a controversy that lasted for at least a decade and the final days of Johnson also attracted a great deal of attention, but Marat's death had the greatest impact of the three. His assassination gave impetus to the Jacobins' attempt to eliminate the influence of the church and greatly expand the influence of the state. Marat's project to transform France failed, but so did the projects of Hume and Johnson. Hume argued that religious belief was based on the foolish fear of death, yet religion remained a strong force in Britain. Johnson hoped for a return to God-fearing religion, yet the educated classes continued to prefer a more benign brand of Christianity in which God's benevolence was stressed far more than his judgment.nthusiasm); what are the effects of luxury; and what is the nature of the passions.

The work then offers more a tour of European enlightenments as they influenced this major British historian. It will add to the pleasure of reading the Decline and Fall as it provides the subtext of how Gibbon transformed the epochs of the Roman Emperors and Byzantium into post-Christian school lessons for modern history. Given the breadth of Pocock's erudition it is not recommended for the academically shallow. The style is challenging, the references intermittently difficult to understand. But even when tempted to subject some of his findings or even his take on major cultural issues to task, his indefatigable marshalling of evidence and telling detail makes this a major work of distinction.

The result is hardly hard science but it does provide further inclination toward a reconsideration of the possibility that what we call consciousness, though species specific as a biological and cultural artifact is at is root reflective of the innate intentionality, or intelligence or design of the universe or spacetime or matter itself in some way. This is the tendency of many books on science and religion and consciousness.<br />The transformative power of spiritual experiences is well known-drug addicts have recovered after them, and hardened criminals have reformed. But is there a scientific explanation for this phenomenon, which Indians call &quot;yoga&quot;? Although Eastern traditions have long pondered this mystery, Western science has tended to dismiss spiritual experiences as whimsy on the part of believers.<br />In The True Path, Mathew draws on his own extensive knowledge of neuroscience to prove the age-old Indian idea that spirituality is a state of mind, a higher form of consciousness. He shows how the latest brain research supports the idea that quieting the neurons that control everyday activities allows for a more spiritual contemplation of life. As this part of the brain slows down, other parts become more freely expressed, promoting relaxation and pleasure in one'ssurroundings. With scientific evidence that this &quot;pure consciousness&quot; truly exists, Mathew shows how to use meditation, yoga, and other traditional Indian methods of contemplation to achieve this spiritual state of mind. The work makes some important connections about the nature of yoga and emerging neuroscience. Worth a read.	2001-07-23

In tackling head-on the highly charged issue of God's relevance to contemporary cosmology, the breadth of Gibson's perspective on his subject matter is amazing: from virtual reality to the meaning of life and from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. Books like this do not come along very often. I suggest one take a couple of mornings off and read through it. God and the Universe will provide some important novel perspectives about how things can mean from the smallest to the largest and how perhaps best to go about learning more. God and the Universe is a preliminary exploration to suggest strategies to discover ways out of this impasse, conceived as the first of a series of books. It displays many limitations: does the book cover too much ground and too many subjects? Gibson does not engage with Hegel, and is content only occasionally to treat Kant. The book addresses Aristotle's Poetics, rather than, as one might expect, his Metaphysics, and instead attempts to construct metaphysical problems out of our contemporary astrophysics, without introducing the significance of the reception of Aristotle's thinking into Christian theology. But, however one assesses, for example, Kant's contribution to `faith and reason' and `God's relation to the world' debates, the effect of systematically commenting upon Kant's great opus, or other seminal authors, is to be regulated by the controlling notions of relevance and commentary to which they subject us, and to which they have been subjected. This is not a whim by which one denounces or discards such authors, but to attempt, however imperfectly, to stand as far as is possible independently of these histories of influence and to think afresh. Yet to ignore them is both impossible and to delight in alienation. Gibson has tried to produce a different sort of use and this avoidance of authorities. The learning is staggering and can leave one wondering what are Gibson's premises. Still this read is pure adventure that many will find plenty to think about, even if the details eventually take us in different directions.It's an important read.ion.

Now he returns to study of Milton in this magisterial book. Fish is popularly known for inadvertently setting off the most embarrassing scandal in the science wars when Alan Sokal's hoaxing contribution to Fish's journal, Social Text was denounced by Sokal as a paradoy of postmodernist cant. Fish's own pathetic comeback dampened the brief hegemony of postmodernist political trends. Fish is also a controversial legal theorist (The Trouble with Principle) and a glib combatant in the culture wars (There's No Such Thing as Free Speech and It's a Good Thing, Too), but it is as a reader of John Milton that he first made his most enduring mark, with 1967's Surprised by Sin.In the wake of the Sokal disaster, Fish has left the demoralized English department of Duke University for the University of Illinois, Chicago where he has returned his attentions to his once-revolutionary reader-response criticism in this surprisingly jargon free study, How Milton Works. This book concentrates on the whole range of Milton's oeuvre in prose and poetry. Fish asserts that the core of Milton's significance is richly theologically, in that &quot;there is only one choice to be or not to be allied with divinity.&quot; In various chapters Fish reworks the rich mythic structure of Paradise Lost to show how the Fall that separated Satan from Heaven parallels Adam and Eve loss Eden. So the meaning of human existence is the attempt to find restoration in the Divine image. This is perhaps ironically the single foundation of meaningful action, politics, individuality, and poetry, including Milton's own. It is obvious that not all readers of Milton will so easily agree with Fish's premises or conclusions but it is likely to quicken Milton study as his earlier study did. Also his painstaking close readings and carefully wrought arguments, enough so that perhaps many will be encouraged to return and read anew this most British of our poets. The rich architecture of Milton's epics, it abstract phrasing and taut moral reach and ambivalence that is at once immobile in its traditionalism and radical in it modernism makes Fish's readings and argument another milestone in Milton studies.king close readings and carefully wrought arguments, enough so that perhaps many will be encouraged to return and read anew this most British of our poets.

Stroyar's study of the deep disorientation of torture victims fuels the plot development though as she admits in her notes she actually down played worst of common modern torture practice.

Torrance (Templeton Foundation) focuses on a new worldview, emerging from the science of the last decades of the second millennium. Its metaphor is the cosmic dance, or the harmony existing between systems that are so strongly interdependent that they behave as a single entity. This dance image hints at a general, evolving pattern in which all objects in the universe participate-like the ordered chaos of an African open-air market. Some of the chapters discuss the nature of processes in the universe, including chaos and chance in the game of life. The reconciliation of variety and unity are addressed in reference to the space-time continuum and the unified field of relativity theory. Del Re continues the investigation into an exploration of the origins of freedom and ethics, suggesting that science indicates that the human species may have a specific task in the universe: building a bridge between matter and spirit. Del Re ponders alchemy, the significance of symbols, and the meaning of the soul. Woven throughout a variety of esoteric and scientific inquiries is the underlying sense of the unifying principles of science and a spiritual outlook. The questions raised are issues that will be discussed by an emerging network of scientists and spiritual seekers, and this book will add a valued and informed perspective to these conversations. The Cosmic Dance is a playful book that takes a broad view of the subject of science and religious aspiration. Del Re wants us to keep an open and playful imagination about how we think and experiment with the universe. The book may please some who are naturally inclined to an esoteric science and irritate material reductionists if there are really very many of them left. If there are this book is to braod  in its humanistic reach to engage them to reconsider their entrenchment. For the rest of us The Cosmic Dance is a pleasure to read. &quot;This book is intended to take you on a voyage through the main ideas and discoveries of contemporary science, from physics to biology; a voyage aimed at finding out how the wonders the scientists have discovered can contribute to a wholesome personal outlook on life and the universe. &quot;The times are over when our voyage would have been a royal visit to the empire which human ingenuity has conquered for our welfare and pleasure; it will be a humble and patient search for the meaning of the greatest concepts of science in the context of poetry, history, and philosophy.

Ray (Shambhala) Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet by Reginald A. Ray (Shambhala) are companion volumes that can be read together or apart. It is approaching 30 years or so that authentic Tibetan Buddhist teachings became generally available in America for Americans. Ray is a Buddhist scholar who is also a disciple of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the founder of Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado; where Ray now teaches. These two books represent a brilliant synthesis of the general outlines and assumptions, degrees and types of Buddhist practice within the Tibetan American tradition as it has become popular in American religious practice and thought. Ray is pretty clear about the narrow scope of his writing. It is not Tibetan religion per se that is being described but the uniquely evolving hybrid that is adapting to American spiritual needs. Seen baldly in such a light, the volumes might be seen as a product of this synthesis, but that does not mean what Ray writes is inaccurate, quite the contrary. Learning Tibetan Buddhism can be an overwhelming emotional intellectual whirlwind of strange demonesque gods and bodhisattvas, complex, time-consuming rituals, complex and simple meditations, and mountains of scriptures with even more massive commentaries. In Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism, Ray not only provides an accessible new introduction to the history, the religion, and the philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism, which may quell the concerns friends and relatives of new practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism. Ray provides important relevant context to what Tibetan Buddhism is trying to do and historical and religious explanations that makes intelligible these practices to outsiders and neophytes alike. The information presented in these volumes gives a Tibetan overview of the whole of Buddhist tradition with some special pleading toward a new emerging nonsectarian ecumenical Buddhist practice that attempts to embrace and transcend postmodernisms so that a devout Catholic or Jew can remain within their own tradition and still seek enlightenment from a Tibetan guru. Even if one is not so blithe to such a pluralistic eventuality these volumes come close to explaining what Tibetan Buddhists are up to and what one is likely to be challenged to do if one is persuaded toward Buddhist practice. And as popular marketing these books should work wonders. They are likely to attract many newcomers to experiment with Buddhist practice and at the same time calm the fears of people who do not understand what all the fuss is about. It is unlikely that those of serious narrow religious conviction will actually be tolerant enough to read these volumes, but for parents and friends concerned about a youth's choice to practice Buddhism, they provide a reasonably honest portrait of what Tibetan Buddhism has been coming to meaning within America and Western Europe today. With meticulous care and poignant specify, Ray tells how Buddhism ended up in Tibet from the great universities of Mahayana teachings in India. We are regaled with fantastic tales of scholar monk saints pioneering into the Tibetan frontier, laying the foundation for various schools of Buddhist practice that developed over the centuries. Ray is neither popularizing nor secularizing the images and history of Tibetan Buddhism, nor does he diminish its magical and mythical elements. Ray introduces to a shamanic cosmos populated gods and demons, an animistic cosmos that also integrates the major agnostic and antimetaphysical tenets of Buddhism, highlighting the resulting practices and their schools. Ending Indestructible Truth, Ray shows how the various schools of Madhyamika, Buddhist centrist philosophy, developed to current consensual particle and debate today. It is fare to say that Indestructible Truth offers a fine introduction to Tibetan Buddhism as Mahayanapractice. The recently published Secret of the Vajra World continues to unveil the meaning of Tantric practice within Tibetan Buddhist American context. Many fine points are offered,explaining rationales for teacher worship (not the zombie mind-control so common in the media but a sort of high ethical introject, or transference for personal maturation), visualization of gods and goddesses, the meaning of mahamudra and dzogchen, and the importance of retreat. Both Indestructible Truth and Secret of the Vajra World represent important landmarks for explaining how Tibetan Buddhism is becoming Americanized and how Buddhism is appealing to those with spiritual longings. If you want to get a good idea about what Tibetanism Buddhism is in America then these two books provide a grand roadmap. Highly recommendedpractice.

Aspects of the Screenplay deals extensively with film dialogue: how best to write it and still address issues of structure, plot, and character. It is one of the first books to focus on the craft of dialogue writing, offering invaluable advice that will encourage you to sit down and want to write. Just as there is more than one way to write a script, there is more than one way to write a &quot;how to write a script&quot; book. Axelrod begins where every book on screenwriting should begin, with Aristotle's Poetics, and finishes where every book should end, with notes about the business. Throughout the text, he offers as examples some of the best&amp;#64979;known screenplays in recent years, including Rocky; The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover; Rain Man; Citizen Kane; The Big Chill; Ordinary People; Breaking Away; Four Weddings and a Funeral; Romancing the Stone; The Name of the Rose; The Fisher King; One Flew Over the Cuchoo's Nest; The Graduate; and Pulp Fiction.

Now perhaps we are more aware of power and shape of female sexuality than we were then. Also it was easier to be accepting of stereotyping as some form of archetypal mandate of gender polarity than it is now. Again homosexuality and bisexuality seem now more normative (even if you are straight), so some of the gay bashing and other rigid gender typing imported from a superficial glance at sexual symbolism around the globe makes the book a little out of focus. Still for many of us, that God wants us to be sexy seems a sinful idea, then this little book will titillate us out of that ugly life-denying myth. So cheers for the effort even if the culture has moved into a wider and more sophisticated grasp of esoteric energy work and meditation than this book can possibly suggest. As a how-to the book is too superficial, and the esoteric meditations are not adequately reported as to become welcome guides on how to let divine energy catch afire in our lovemaking. The colorizing of some of the black and white line drawings definitely adds to the erotica appeal of the work, and it is as a mild piece of sacred sexuality that the work best serves, that is as entertainment rather than instruction.	2001-06-17

True Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism provides a biting critique of western presumptions upon spiritual practice, but in the brief poetic reflections we are shown in Mudra suggest how simple gestures, slight alterations of attitude shift one from suffering to bliss.

Ibn `Arabi can rightly be regarded as the greatest mystical thinker in the history of Islam and as might be extrapolated from this study, perhaps some future global mysticism that is inter-sectarian. In the Islamic world Ibn 'Arabi  is often referred to honorifically as al-Shaykh al-Akbar (the Greatest Master).  Among the literalists and reactionary legalists in Islam the profound readings of the Qur'an and hadith, that is the staple of just about everything the Shaykh al-Akbar' wrote, is regarded with shrewd suspicion, if not outright hostility and censor. Among a core of Sufis the Shaykh al-Akbar's works have been savored with a relish and delight as often his lengthy considerations show a nearly unfathomable grasp for the living presence of the divine in all aspects of life. Any mystic can find much to ponder in a studied reading of Ibn 'Arabi's texts. For the many Christians and some Jews who are still perhaps unconsciously swayed by the centuries of anti-Islamic polemic in the west, an astute reading of Shaykh al-Akbar's work should banish many of the silly sectarian ideas that cling to our ideas about Islam. Muslims themselves are still extreamly divided over the worth of Shaykh al-Akbar's views and common misattributions to him of pantheism and even incarnationism are still common slurs betraying a willful misreading of Shaykh al-Akbar's ideas. Though it is unlikely that The Unlimited Mercifier  will seriously affect this perennial debate about Shaykh al-Akbar's ultimate worth as a Muslim, Hirtenstein does offer a useful introduction to ibn `Arabi that has not existed in English before. I believe that as scholarly work proceeds on translating the profound depth of Islam as a spiritual path toward knowing self and the divine will become more widely appreciated. The perspective of Shaykh al-Akbar, acknowledged and not, definitely sets the standard of any spiritual reading of the Qur'an. Also in the emerging world spirituality ibn `Arabi may yet play an unique role is forging a link between the monotheisms of the west to the pantheisms and non-theisms of the east and of a rationalist scientific humanisms of modernity. The Unlimited Mercifier provides not only an introduction to the life and ideas of ibn `Arabi but without too strong a reading between the lines that the importance and perennial relevance of Shaykh al-Akbar's ideas for emerging global civilization become apparent. Given this breath I highly recommend this introduction and eventually a closer consideration of the of Shaykh al-Akbar's works as available in the works reviewed below.

Both Dzogchen and Mahamudra represent important indigenous developments of Tantric teachings in Tibet. Like all wisdom traditions, Buddhism rests upon the transmission of heart-essence realization and dharma from one generation to the next. Dzogchen, literally &quot;great perfection,&quot; is the primary teaching of the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism, having been carried to Tibet in the eighth century by Padmasambhava, who is recognized as a &quot;second Buddha.&quot; This actualization of what Dzogchen is is sent out through this collection of empowerments given from 1982-1989 by the 14th Dalai Lama. Sogyal Rinpoche (The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying) requested these teachings, and His Holiness the Dalai Lama obliged with emphasis on the 5th Dalai Lama's visionary receipt of Dzogchen teaching, which is summarized simply by the verse: &quot;Ema! Phenomena are, without exception, Perfect within the continuum of self-arising rigpa.&quot; Ema is an expression of wonder and astonishment. Whereas rigpa is a technical term for root single awareness that illuminates all; whereas ordinary awareness is that but as refracted into various experiences of subject and object, so that the unity becomes a secret, except for those who are aware of the nature of the root awareness then everything is the root awareness. To attempt to understand enough so that one can cut through the veils of separations that is usually the habit mind. Of course the development of habitual indwelling in non-divisive bliss might be more fun than reading hundreds of books. But as the verse say there is no difference at the root or in the stem and branch or such preferences seeming important. Empowerments are a principle way the Tibetans are bringing Buddha dharma to the west. An empowerment is the oral recitation of the teaching with impromptu commentary for the audience. It is done with a ritual format so that there can be prayers, chants and other meditation aids going on but the most important aspect of the empowerment is that the teacher and his assistants as well as the whole audience is speaking at the time from within the nondual realization of what is being taught. In other words the Dalai Lama and his retinue are all within a state of actualization of the reality to which the teaching refers. As the audience is also so attuned the psychic contagion can be intense and experiences can quickly and deeply cut through the fog of our surface consciousness. Now this volume is likely to be popular among students of Buddhism, but, except for the Appendix: Compassion, the Heart of Enlightenment; the texts would confuse the novice. Because of this I recommend several other texts that provide more systematic accounts of the Dzogchen traditions and how they fit in with the wider traditions of Buddhist practice. The Golden Letters: The Three Statements of Garab Dorje, the First Teacher of Dzogchen, Together With a Commentary by Garab Dorje, edited and translated with a commentary by John Myrdhin Reynolds (Snow Lion Press) In many ways the best guide to Dzogchen teachings.

The letters of Paulinus and his correspondents portray an early Christian 'web' of shared concepts, intellectual discussion, and group development. Catherine Conybeare examines how the very process of writing and transmitting letters between members of a community helped to bind that community together and to aid the creation of ideas that would continue to reverberate for centuries. Paulinus was key to that group iconic as a model of behavior, as a conversion success story, and as an intellectual contributor able to bridge the old world and the new. A subtext shows how neoplatonism was christianized by this network of new converts which included Augustine among others.	2001-05-18

He studied divinity and later lectured at Trinity College, Dublin. He went to London to muster support for a venture to establish a college in Bermuda for colonists and Indians in America. Although his college never came to be, he spent three years in the colonies and was a stimulus to the development of higher education in America. This venture also laid the foundation for public reputation for piety. In 1734 he was appointed bishop at Cloyne, in which office he devoted himself to the social and economic plight of Ireland. Berman's biography is a subtle introduction to the life and thought of the second of the three great British empiricists, the first being John Locke and the third David Hume. Berkeley most remarked upon philosophical view is best expressed in the Latin expression esse est percipi, &quot;to be is to be perceived.&quot; This is a type of philosophical idealism that considers that nothing can exist apart from minds and the contents of minds. To say that a material object exists is to say that it is or can be seen, heard, or otherwise perceived by a mind. Philosophers such as John Locke had adopted the view that human knowledge depends on the existence of material objects independent of minds or ideas. These objects causally produce ideas in our minds. Locke held that in some respects our ideas resemble objects in the material world, but some qualities that objects appear to have are not in the objects but depend upon our minds. That is, material objects possess in reality the measurable, quantitative qualities, such as size and weight, but their sense qualities, such as color, odor, and taste, depend upon the mind. Against this view Berkeley held that all the qualities of the object depend upon the mind. Since objects have stable and regular existence, the mind they depend on must be divine rather than human. In Berkeley's view, therefore, the existence of a divine mind follows directly from the commonsense belief that physical objects exist when no one is perceiving them. Berkeley believed that the Lockean view gave a basis for skepticism and atheism. His arguments have been of continuing interest to philosophers. In this biography the whole cloth of Berkeley's ideas and theology as well as his enthusiastic endorsement of tar-water as a replacement to strong spirits and a general aid to health are given full form. The philosophical Berkeley is important but the Bishop Berkeley, social reformer and enthusiast is definitely more interesting. Highly recommended as a humanist introduction to the good Bishop of Cloyne.e mind follows directly from the commonsense belief that physical objects exist when no one is perceiving them.

Now over ten years in print this major account of the world's religions is the best resource for authoritative information on the world's major religious traditions. Still the work remains especially uneven in the quality of articles. Eliade died soon after the work was in production and there was not as strong or even editorial control over the quality and depth of information presented. Some scholars did excellent contributions, others are rather slap-dash and the selection of article length and topics selected seem somewhat bewildering and idiosyncratic. The work did show something of the creative ferment in religious studies but it tended to avoid controversy or provide a systematic view of history or of religions. But even with these qualifications it is the only current Encyclopedia of religion though it is hoped that some of the Internet projects now in creation will eventually make up for its generally uneven executions.

Not because the text was scarce but that the technical command of Tibetan scholastic language, logic, hermeneutics, and exegeses of Buddhist scripture were needed to approach this powerful work.

It is hoped that the next two volumes will quickly follow However there is currently two  provisional translations of these sections by Alex Wayman. The second volume describes the path of the Bodhisattva path. This work is available in part in Ethics of Tibet: Bodhisattva Section of Tsong-kha-pa's Lam Rim Chen Mo translated by Alex Wayman (SUNY Series in Buddhist Studies; State University of New York Press).  Asanga's Chapter on Ethics With the Commentary of Tsong-kha-pa: The Basic Path to Awakening, the Complete Bodhisattva translated by Mark Tatz (Edwin Mellen Press) also addresses stages of the path and basic Buddhist morality but draws upon another commentary by Tsong-kha-pa. Alex Wayman's Calming the Mind and Discerning the Real (Columbia, 1978) provided a pioneering translation of the third part focuses on the practical integration of quieting techniques with spiritual discernment that leads to wisdom. It is true that Wayman's translations have been held up to censure by the Lama trained cadre of scholars who are now making this new edition. It is also true that some of their reservations are deserved but I still find much of value in the Wayman editions and until the next two volumes of The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment are available I suggest they be consulted.  All told  The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment is one of the masterpieces of world religion, a non parallel introduction to the fundamentals of Buddhist practice in all its subtlety and powerful psychological insight. The work will repay close study for anyone drawn to the salvific motive of religion, anyone who wishes to engage in-depth the nature of life and the way to knowing through meditation.

Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History by James Carroll In this complex, personal and yet deeply thought attempt to respond to the core of Anti-Semitism which is NT anti-Judaism within the long night of Shoah, Carroll struggles with the complexity of history and identity and the need to deeply repent (without consolations of redemptive suffering) the profound injustice of Christianity that asserts its own reason for being in the rejections of Judaism. It is odd how people find the discomfort this book attempts to address so threatening that some reviewer's think that some jingoistic appeals to various Bishop's condemnations to pogroms throughout the Churches history cannot address the deeper core of how Christianity (as well as Judaism and Islam) needs to deeply reconsider normative visions of their respective faiths and identity to approach the Unity of the God to which they all turn to worship. Carroll attempts to address these issues well. His insights are often too editorializing but given the need to invent more sophisticated harmless and non-antagonistic religious messages within that do not hurt humanity that is not within and is without any of their saving message, this work moves in the right direction by considering these issues. Conservatives within Catholicism may not understand that ignoring the wider non-Christian world is no longer a luxury they can afford without seriously compromising the truth of their Faith. At least Carroll has made an attempt to move the discussion along.	2001-03-01

She now has turned her efforts to the translation of the Ennarationes in Psalmos, a collection of preached sermons and written commentary on all one-hundred fifty psalms. This first volume includes commentaries on the first thirty-two psalms, with two expositions of six psalms, three of Psalm 32, and four of Psalm 30.<br />These expositions show Augustine at prayer, albeit public prayer in front of a congregation, and addressing a mixed audience, i.e. one composed of more learned and less learned hearers, a distinction he sometimes make reference to as determining the nature of his discourse on a particular day. And thus they show Augustine to be the great preacher and teacher he is. Some of the expositions show Augustine thinking aloud, as when he considers verse six of the first psalm, &quot;I rested and fell asleep,&quot; which he variously interprets. He notes that different translations interpret the original Greek differently, and he offers his own thoughts on possible interpretations.<br />For one not used to patristic interpretation of scripture, Augustine's commentary can be jarring, since he does not just deal with the text on the level of literal interpretation, but he also includes what have come to be known, since the middle ages, as the analogical and anagogical interpretations, i.e. interpretations of what the psalm means in terms of Christianity and what it says to us about moral behavior, all part of Augustine's sensus plenior.<br />Some of his well-known themes appear, also, and the commentary offers another light on them. In the exposition of Psalm 5, Augustine treats of lying, commenting on the verse, &quot;You hate all those who work iniquity.&quot; He gives a  brief summary of the discussion on lying and concealing the truth that are found in more expansive forms in his treatises on that subject. The footnotes often are helpful in noting echoes of other works, although here, strangely, there is no reference to his other discussions of lying. He also offers a reflection on God as father and mother in Exposition 2 of Psalm 26, a discussion that might be surprising to some readers.<br />Overall, the Expositions of the Psalms offers what amounts to a mini-course in Augustinian theology, since all of his keys themes are treated in an abbreviated manner at some point in the exposition. And Augustine offers his advice to the people on praying the psalms in his fourth exposition of Psalm 30: &quot;If the psalm is praying, pray yourselves; if it is groaning, you groan too; if it is happy, rejoice; if it is crying out in hope, you hope as well; if it expresses fear, be afraid.&quot;<br />Michael Fiedrowicz's introduction offers a good exposition on how to read this work, placing it in historical and literary context, with an especially good explanation of Augustine's method of interpretation.  At the back of the book is an index of Scripture citations and a general index.bject.

Generally analytical chemistry is concerned with the detection and identification of atoms, ions or radicals that of which a substance is composed, the compounds they form, and the proportions of these compounds that are present in a given substance. The editors define analytical chemistry as the measurement, characterization and mapping of chemical species or sys­tems varying from (1) the components of life, such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, clinical samples, biomedi­cal spectroscopy, forensics; (2) threats and safeguards to life as in chemical weapons agents, pesticides, environ­ment, industrial hygiene and forensics; (3) life critical or enhancing analyses, such as food and pharmaceuticals; and (4) analyses required by industry, such as coatings, particle size, polymers, rubbers, metals, pulp and paper, process, petroleum and surfaces. The techniques utilized span the in-situ analysis of soil, water, waste, air and the human body, to laboratory analyses, remote sensing and stellar spectroscopy.<br />This major reference work, an epoch in a practical and summary statement of basic methods and procedures in many material sciences, will become a foremost location for baseline descriptions of chief features of analytical chemistry. The contributors to Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry: Applications, Theory and Instrumentation included over 800 authors, more than 600 peer reviewers, 42 Section Editors and 13 distinguished Board Members and Advisors worked on the production of the Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry: Applications, Theory and Instrumentation for more than three years. Their objective was to prepare the largest, most comprehensive compendium of analytical chemistry ever. Indeed, this work has twice the bulk and breadth of any other such compendium, such that a chemist (organic, polymer, inorganic, biochemist, molecular biologist as well as, of course, an analytical chemist), or a physicist or engineer (environmental, industrial or materials) can find all the essential information required to analyze any analyte in any matrix for any purpose or application, interpret the results and also to gain a thorough knowledge of the theory and instrumentation utilized.s well as, of course, an analytical chemist), or a physicist or engineer (environmental, industrial or materials) can find all the essential information required to analyze any analyte in any matrix for any purpose or application, interpret the results and also to gain a thorough knowledge of the theory and instrumentation utilized.	2001-02-08

In his commentary on Aristotle's text, 'Simplicius' insists that the intellect in question is not something transcendental, -but the human rational soul. He denies both Plotinus' view that a part of the soul has never descended from uninterrupted contemplation of the Platonic Forms, and Proclus' view that the soul cannot be changed in its substance through embodiment. He also denies that imagination sees things as true or false, which requires awareness of one's own cognitions. He thinks that imagination works by projecting imprints. In the case of mathematics, it can make the imprints more like shapes taken on during sense perception or more like concepts, which calls for lines without breadth. He acknowledges that Aristotle would not agree to reify these concepts as substances, but thinks of mathematical entities as mere abstractions. Addressing the vexed question of authorship, H. J. Blumenthal concludes that the commentary was written neither by Simplicius nor Priscian. In a novel interpretation, he suggests that if Priscian had any hand in this commentary, it might have been as editor of notes from Simplicius' lectures.	2001-01-09

I knew it would be a defining work because at that time there was little in print that described current Wiccan practice. Soon after its publication, if memory serves me right, the Reclaiming Collective was founded, attempting to create a living model in non-patriarchal political power and interpersonal relationships. It has been, as viewed from the outside, an ongoing experiment in applied feminist ethics, anarchist principles of consensus building and activist confrontational political witness. Now some 20 years into the experiment we have some subtle reflections on the practice of magic as personal and collective transformation hung upon a common fairytale. Unlike many works on Wicca this work has more implied in its practice than what is explicitly stated. Twelve Wild Swans will be considered a benchmark in the emerging and ever morphing traditions of neopagan magic practice. It is a good book to study and adapt to one's own coven's magic practice. Twelve Wild Swans is much appreciated and highly recommended for repeated readings.	2000-11-17

The Bible has been used to name, claim, oppress, and exploit natives and the diaspora populations in the Caribbean, and it continues to define Caribbean reality and morality in the twenty-first century. In this anthology, Caribbean scholars and scholars of Caribbean studies analyze the most fundamental assumptions and practices derived from different readings of the Bible at different epochs in Caribbean history. From the doleful slave narratives and missionary misreading of biblical text in the 1700s to the modern militant chant of Rastafari; from the Jamaica Maroon uprising to the Grenada Revolution; from Indo-Guyanese women's reality to Rastafarian &quot;Sistren&quot; spiritu-ality; from the quiet waters of Anglo-Barbadian cultural experience to the high seas of Latino American relations, the anthology tells a grip-ping tale of the struggle of ethnic peoples to find meaning, &quot;existence,&quot; and reality in a world they did not create. In a region charac-terized by colonialism and now functioning as a postcolonial environment with a dominant presence of Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and Rastafarians, the possibilities with all their complexities are infinite.	2000-11-17

For Des-cartes, science was possible only because of certain features of the very nature of human beings. Schouls focuses on two largely neglected aspects of Descartes' position: the intellectual imagina-tion and free will. Joining these top-ics together within the context of Cartesian doctrine, Schouls opens up a substantially new reading of the Meditations and a more complete picture of Descartes as a scientist. This revisioning of science follows from Schouls' previous study Descartes and the Enlightenment that considers how the philosopher's rationalism became a principle ingredient in the ideological hegemony of Enlightenment reason. In Descartes and the Possibility of Science Schouls asserts that Descartes viewed the intellectual imagination, the source of hypotheses, as crucial to the development of scientific thought. Descartes placed consider-able emphasis on mental power in his discussion of the paths by which humans were to proceed in science, from pure to applied disciplines. Schouls explores the roles of differ-ent kinds of imagination in meta-physics, in pure physics or geome-try, and in the applied sciences. He inquires further that, for Descartes, free will was also indispensable in the pursuit of knowledge. Without it, the scientific enterprise could neither start nor continue. Descartes and the Possibility of Science closes with a discussion of the metaphysi-cal bases of free will, intellectual imagination, and other human functions necessary to the advance-ment of science.	2000-10-17

The writings of Francis himself were collected in the first volume, as were the earliest lives of Francis and some liturgical documents. The editors represent the three branches of traditional Franciscanism, and together offer what are as far as I can tell all of the primary sources dealing with the first years of the Order, along with introductions and copious notes. While much of the material is repetitious, what emerges is a portrait of Francis from several different perspectives, not all of them flattering.  The documents collected here represent that period of time in the life of the Order when the followers of Francis were trying to determine how to live the life that he had left them. They show various attempts to interpret his wishes for his followers. Even the different biographies were written with a view toward advancing one or another interpretation of the Franciscan Rule.  Presented in roughly chronological order, the documents show the developing views on Francis and his legacy. The first, The Beginning or Founding of the Order, treats of the development from a group of companions informally gathered around him to the beginnings of what would become the Order of Saint Francis.  The Assisi Compilation, dated 1244-1269, collects personal reminiscences of Francis, and offers a multi-faceted portrait.  In introducing the legends and sermons by Bonaventure of Bagnoregio, the editors show how Bonaventure used the information at his disposal to a certain extent to his own ends. They note that Bonaventure's portrait of Francis became normative for a time, but was later contested.  What results is a fascinating collection of documents illustrating the influence of this great man, and the struggles his followers went through in their attempts to interpret his rule in changing circumstances.  Scripture quotations are put in italics, and the reference supplied in the margin. I did note one mistake: On p. 168, the reference is given as Rv. 4:12, a verse that does not exist. Surely the reference is to one of Paul's epistles.  The editors have critically examined the documents, and indicate where one is dependent on another. The footnotes make reference to varying interpretations of certain passages, and relate the works to earlier Christian writings. An appendix has eleven maps, some showing the geographical or political features of the area, and two showing Assisi at the time of Francis. While the critical apparatus make this work especially valuable for scholars, all those interested in Francis of Assisi or the history of Christianity at the time will appreciate having all of these text gathered into a convenient volume.s his followers went through in their attempts to interpret his rule in changing circumstances.

Hymers' views are perhaps more generous but his proposals do portend a possible shift in the languages of inauthenticity.	2000-09-28

(THEOLOGISCHE BIBLIOTHEK TOPELMANN)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Exceptional insight into the pivot of Tillich's thought	Paul Tillich was one of the more philosophically informed Christian theologians, whose work embodied a sophisticated paradoxality and dialectal rigor. Uwe Carsten Scharf study of Tillich offers a searching study of central movements of Tillich's thought, the clarification of Tillich's concepts of paradox and breakthrough as they illustrate the divine-human interplay of revelation in ontological-metaphorical language. Scharf advances the thesis that the two concepts embody a central tension in his thinking about revelation. The interrelationship of paradox and breakthrough is suggested as each breakthrough happens as a paradoxical event, and that each paradox, then needs to breakthrough to the recipient of revelation. These parallel ideas are constructed upon the base that paradox is not contradiction, and breakthrough is not a breaking apart; so that they are related to a unitive or transcendental reason in the following way. A paradox does not destroy reason but upsets and surprises it. Paradox startles reason. It expresses not contradiction but tension between two elements, or poles, which are affirmed simultaneously, even though they look contradictory. The two poles are also simultaneously negated. The real paradox therefore consists in this tension that there is neither a yes for one pole and a no for the other. Breakthrough likewise then is not a disintegration of insight but open to affirming in the karios, the event of Transcendence that is otherwise than self or expectation. The thesis this study can be broken down into three movements: 1. Tillich expresses his understanding of revelation through the core concepts of paradox and breakthrough. 2. A connection of meaning between the two concepts can be discerned in their usage, and 3. Tillich uses both concepts to distinguish his understanding of revelation from the extremes of naturalism, or idealism, and supranaturalism. The structure of this dialetetic is close to middle way thought of Buddhism though such comparative insights are not considered in this study. Rather Scharf develops this as a historical investigation, advancing a second thesis that Tillich does well in choosing these concepts, for they seem to capture the experience of being approached by the dimension of the ultimate in appropriate and intelligible image-concepts. Paradox and breakthrough approximate the dynamics and form of the unspeakable divine-human encounter (revelation) by using conceptual-symbolic imagery of structure (paradox) and of event (breakthrough). The autobiographical aspect of this study is that Scharf provides the first provisional translation of Tillich's &quot;Systematische Theologie&quot; of 1913. This was his earliest known attempt to give system to his thought. The polarity between paradox and breakthrough are seen to be central to his earliest and most mature expressions of his thinking. Few theologians should ignore this consummate exploration of the pivotal tensions in Tillich's thought.comparative insights are not considered in this study.

Each  volume is a museum of sexual explicit images as conceived by some of the  best known and otherwise unknown illustrators of  viewable penetration. The  first volume of EROTICA UNIVERSALIS I gathered together a wonderfully  in-depth selection of the erotica that has thrived in a parallel art world.  It starts with ancient Greek and Roman, but is mostly devoted to painting  and drawing of the last few centuries. There are about 750 images. Each  illustration is given a full page and many are accompanied by a brief but  revealing summary of the original text.  Now the companion volume, EROTICA  UNIVERSALIS II, documents the rich history of erotic art created as book  illustration. Tucked away in every important national library and countless  private libraries are the restricted or banned books to which the public  has limited access. Gilles Neret has assembled a remarkable collection of  artwork created by artists like Rembrandt, Boucher, Fragonard, Dali,  Picasso and Matisse to accompany the writings of such literary giants as  Ovid, Voltaire, Verlaine, and de Maupassant. Equally compelling are the  astonishing contributions of lesser-known but prodigiously talented artists  expressing the arousing variety of human sexual expression.	2000-08-11

Carefully crafted translations, versions of his poems are more universally  popular than most contemporary poet's work. His imagery and mystical fervor  inspires and informs the hearts of lovers everywhere, yet there has been  very little accessible scholarly work available about the Sufi and his life  and times for many years. Most accounts of Rumi have stayed toward the  legendary rather than the critical and historical account of his life. With  Lewis work we are given a wonderfully fulsome account of the scholarly work  about Rumi, not just in English but throughout the world. Lewis provides us  with a critical account of his life and times as well as a brief history of  the Sufi order that has thrived in his name. This work is now the best  thorough introduction to the poet and mystic both for scholars and public.  Highly recommended.	2000-08-08

It combines chronological and personality-based approaches to the subject with a thematic discussion  of principal Sufi notions and institutions. As a general introduction the  volume obviously serves a need. Sufism is examined from a variety of  different perspectives: as a vibrant social institution, a specific form of  artistic expression (mainly poetic), an ascetic and contemplative practice,  and a distinctive intellectual tradition that derived its vitality from a  dialogue with other strands of Islamic thought.<br />The book emphasizes the  wide variety of Sufism's interactions with the society and its institutions  from an ascetic withdrawal from the world to an active involvement in its  affairs by individual, masters and organizations. ISLAMIC MYSTICISM by  Knysh is a comprehensive survey of the interesting and fascinating world of  Islamic mysticism written for scholars and students interested in Islamic  Mysticism, Islamic Studies, Religious Studies and the History of Religions.  The work will have to most appeal to students attempting to get a general  scholarly grasp on this field as an academic field of inquiry.	2000-07-26

This near legendary state of some advanced contemplative is here given an autobiographical setting. It is  important for its hints of psychological insights but even more revealing  as an historic document to show how difficult such states are in the  context of current spiritual culture. This an extraordinary account of the  experience of selflessness points to the heart of spiritual experience that  is fully gifted and not an achievement of practice as self-control. The  simplicity of the narrative and its reasonable honesty provides an  illuminating account of one woman's experience of loss of personal identity  and constant sense of Emptiness. Her eventual discovery, after much fear  and pain, the emptiness become a calm entrance to unity and peace.  Segal's  opinions in COLLISION WITH THE INFINITE will also poke holes in the  work-ethic of Buddhist practice and other forms of spiritual go-gettering.  Highly recommended.	1999-05-05
