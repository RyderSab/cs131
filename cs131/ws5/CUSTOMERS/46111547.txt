I brought this book because I had a good vibe about it and I was so right. Both Storm Constantine and Elousie Coquio have a deep love and respect for Bast and Sekhmet. They give historical facts and the myths of Bast and Sekhmet as well as the other feline gods and goddesses of Egypt. Then they have some real good ritual and meditations. Its not extremly Wicca orintaded at all so if youre looking for Egyptian Wicca then this is not the book. But I am having a real hard time putting this book down. They also go on describing about aura colors, and breathing techniques that I never found in any book. This is one of a kind and if you are intereted in these goddesses then the price is worth it. This is not traditional Egyptian magick as even both authers stress this. This is something their group does. I am not quite finished with this book but I have learned some new information and techniques. The book is nicley written and well organized. The charges are beautyful. They also have a section in the book on recipes to make oils and incenses. Their spells use a ritualized pathworking and meditation. Its not something that is simple and easy. But its not so complicated where you just wanna throw this book off a wall. Rven those who hav a little experience with magick will find this book satisfying. And for those who have a lot of time under their belts with magick you may find this book satisfying as well. I have yet to do all their rituals in this book and I look forward to doing them. I also find that their way of raising the cone of power interesting and more intricate than what Im used to. I really love this book. Thank you Stom and Elouise for writting such a wonderful book on Bast and Sekhmet!	2004-01-27

The pictures are beautyful and the book is loaded on info and is very easy to follow and understand. The spells look interesting as I have yet to do them. I am dedicated to Isis as her priestess and as Her priesstess this book is great for anyone who is feinging to learn of the Holy Mother Isis. Its worth every penny its being sold for.

Welch dismisses the myth that were instilled by Christianity that the male gods were in total control. See back then (duringh the burning times) you could write about the gods as long as they were treated as myths and as long as you do not write about how women and goddesses were seen as important. So this myth gave the people even in modern days that the Norse had little respect for the goddess and women. I love the way Lynda describes the goddesses as been more than &quot;Maiden, Mother and Crone.&quot; She even describes the Yggdrasil as a goddess and she gives an excellent point of view as to why she wrote that. The book describes how Jacob Grimms faiery tales are laced with the stories and descriptions of the Goddess. This book is the first one ever written soley about the Divine Feminine of the North. She does not just grab things from the air as she basses her book on practice, research and meditation. She descriibes Yggdrasil (not in depth), the Goddesses, Giatesses, Norns, Disir and the valeries. She also gives some details on the major religious positions of women back during ancient times before Christianity invaded the lives of the Northern people. This is a must for those who are Goddess worshippers and those who follow the asatru religion. Any pagan would find this a treasure house of information. Though there is no information on spell casting or rituals you can find them in other books. This is a book soley on real good information. This book was hard for me to put down!	2003-04-07

This is a book of not only healing but of spiritual wholeness. This is suitable for any one wheather you are a Wiccan, a New Age Christian, A spiritist, Ceremonial Magician, shaman, atheist no matter what you will find that this book is spiritual but in no way static. The Middle Pillar ritual is discussed here. The auther and editer even state that you can alter it as long as it stays within the proinciple of the ritual. Meaning you can chant the English traslations. Example instead of vibrating Eheih for the crown galgal you can chant &quot;I am&quot;, I see, I speak instead of YHVH Elohim. I love instead of YHVH Eloah ve-d'ath. I create instead of Shaddai El Chai. and I bless instead of Adonai Ha-Aretz. Also you can do a silent vibration for the God names as well. The color scale they use for the MP here is the elemental scale instead of the Briatic col! ors of the Tree of Life. For Wiccan you can change it to your traditional colors of the elements. But the suggestion here is when you first begin is to see each galgal gold or white and to actually vibrate the god names. Also there is a variation of using the chackras instead of just using the galgals. (They are diffrent in ways, too many authers confuse the galgals with the chackras). This is a very easy to read and easy to understand and is suitable for the beginner.  Also they give out the basic associations of the planetary powers and colors. The positive color is given out as well as the negative color. This is not to be confused as good or bad. The Sun positive color is orange the negative color is yellow. The moon the positive color is blue the negative color is puce. Mercury the positive color is yellow the negative color is orange. Venus the positive and negative color is both emerald green. Mars the positive and negative color isboth red. Jupiter the positive c! olor is purple the negative color is blue. Saturn the positive col or is Indigo the negative color is black. Now when visualising something for yourself and using color you use the negative colors. Why? Because the negative colors are receptive and bring in. You want to attract these thing to yourself. You want to be a magnet to these forces. When using color visualizations for someone else you would use the positive colors and direct the energy you have built up using the MP to send the energy. This way the active energy is being sent to that person or animal. Its practical and makes total sense. This book will give you the prelimenary guide in healing yourself and then others. It is important to heal yourself so that the energy you send out is balanced. If you are mentally stressed or drained or tired how can you heal anyone else? In the afterword of this book Marc Allen gives a few variations of the Middle Pillar and gives a basic lesson (very, very basic) on Tree Of Life and shows how the the sign of Venus or the Ankh can be formed from t! he Sephiroth on the Tree this shows the power of love, life and healing that this system can give you if you work at it. The introduction by Marc Allen in very interesting and nice, those who get this book should read the intro first before jumping into this book as it will give you a grip on what you will be learning and experiencing. This book is only 110 pages long and is a true work of beauty that will help in achieving the Great Work.	2003-02-25

Of course he did not add any of her letters but he added his. He explains a lot about magick, Thelema, and spirituality. Its more a book on very good information than a ritual instruction book. You wont find out how to do the Middle Pillar or how to properly evoke a goetic spirit, but if you are looking for a book that gives good info on the subject of Magick then this is a good book to get. This one is pretty easy to understand, some of Crowleys works can be confusing to some. When my copy of this book fell apart I purchased a new copy, its that good.

Too me its one of those treasures I considder priceless and I will hold on to for good! ! ! I am very pleased at what has been put into this book.

I like the fact that he gives a small lesson on magick and how to empower the herbs that one is to use in magickal workings. He also expalins the importance of empowering the herbs to use right before using them in a spell. The reference is very good and loaded with information about many herbs. Also he lists the safety issue with every herb he has listed. This is very important, not all herbs are healthy to use. Like cats claw, it should not be used by those who have had a transplant, nursing or pregnant women. Some people thinks its fine to use herbs on a daily basis, well after a while it can build up toxcity.

He served as a priest in the Dakashineswar Kali temple in Calcutta India. He was a priest of Kali. He died of lung cancer. In this gospel there is history about the man-god Sri Ramakrishna and his teachings. Although I personally dont agree 100 percent on everything he said, not because he was wrong or right, its because I have my own beliefs. But his teachings are very much alive today as they were back then. His teachings are spiritually uplifting. Im attracted to him because I had some of his experiences and if he were alive today in the flesh he would totally understand where Im comming from. This is a book I wont ever give away.

I really love his works. He never adds dribble to his writtings and he knows what he is talking about. This book clears up the silly untrue myths about Aleister Crowley. The myths of Crowley being a Satanists and a baby killer. And how he died. Lon Duquette describes how these myths became circulated in the first place. This book is to the point and easy to understand. He also gives the reasons why Crowley used the averse pentagram and the controversy that started up from him doing so. Duquette is a True Magician and Thelemite and also a Crowley expert.. There is much to learn from this book. He teaches you how to do the Magick of Thelema step by easy step and gives the reasons for the importance of the steps and the rituals themselves. He also teaches you about the pentagrams and hexagrams and how the Unicursal Hexagram was developed. You can find the Star Saphire Ritual, Hexagram Ritual, Star Ruby, Pentagram Rituals, Mass Of The Phoneix, Gnostic Mass, and more. (my comment every Sunday the Gnostic Mass is done in the OTO) Also in this book you can find THE BOOK OF THE LAW, an illustration of the Tree of Life, The paraphrase of the inscriptians upon the overse and the reverse sides of the Stele Of Revealing and a color plate of the Stele of Revealing as well.  He gives a short description of the Aeon Of Isis, the Aeon of Osiris and the New Aeon  of Horus. Duquette also gives descriptions of the Thelemic orders the OTO and the A^A^ (the A^A^ stands for Argenteum Astrum(Silver Star) founded by Aleister Crowley and George Cecil Jones.)  The OTO stands for Ordo Templi Orientis the founding father was Karl Kellner later Crowley was given leadership of the order in the English speaking world in 1912 and pretty much changed things around. The book is forwarded by Hymenaeus Beta X Frater Superior. There is so much more goodies to this book and once I picked it up I just could not put it down. So for thoses who are interested in Aleister Crowley, Thelema, or Ceremonial Magick do not pass this one up.

But the true Vitki will love this one i bet. There is nothing satanic in this book as a few others have claimed. This book goes into the rune and gives you the inner vision of the power of each rune. This is a great companion to his other  book Futhark. Both are great and accurate. Edred Thorsson is a true master of his craft.	2002-12-31

This is a great book on potion making. But be careful all because something is natural does not mean it cant make you sick. Like Cats claw is not good for a pregnant woman to drink. She does not put these warning on her book. Regardless of the reader not being warned it is a great book. O love the mandrake section and I have incorporated some of her potions in my spells. The Mandrake potion for revenge is a good one. Im glad this book is not a wishy washy goodie two shoe book. She has postive uses for her potions as well most of these potions are for positive purposes. By the way if your back is against the wall and you need to use a spell to get someone away from you I dont see that as negative I see that as survival. Anyway this is a great book to get wheatehr you are a Witch, Santarian, Shaman or whatever your magickal/spiritual path is this book is of use.	2002-12-31

This is all too much for a beginner to take in at one time. I mean the auther puts a lot in it. The information is awesome but can be overwhelming for a beginner. I would only reccomend this to a beginner if the student would read it slowly and carefuller or else she/he will not get too much out of it. I love the color plates and you can use these for meditation and tantric purposes unless you feel you are crafty enough to make your own mandalas. He lists the 10 Mahavidya mandalas and in the end section he has instructions for Ganesha Puja. This is not your everyday book on Tantra nor is it filled with useless garbage. The man knows his stuff pretty well.	2002-12-28

CIRCLE OF ISIS<BR>By Ellen Cannon Reed<br />The title is decieving becasue the book is not all about Isis and thats the big reason I ordered this book. But I understand why she called it the Circle of Isis for her love of Isis is so strong. I think Egyptian Wicca would have been more appropiate. Now Mrs Reed doe not claim that she is recreating the magick that the ancient Egyptians used, she states that she is adopting the Egyptian pantheon into her Wiccan beliefs. She gives the experience that she had with the Egyptian deities and the experience that her coven had with them as well. You will find magick in this book but not spells like &quot;to get a lover&quot; or to &quot;to heal a burn&quot; the magick you will learn is with the deities. She gives some wonderful information on quite of few of the gods and goddesses major and minor deities. She gives you recipes for oil and incense for diffrent deities. Also she gives out guided meditations on meeting the deities and ritual on how to contact them. She gives out rituals that are suitable for solitary practice and rituals suitable for a group of people. there are wonderful hymns to the gods and goddesses, instructions on making an Egyptian wand, sistrum, kilt, scarab, wax and ushbati figures and more. She also includes Hierogyphics and their translations and other stuff as well. I honestly could not put this book down I was so fascinated with it. This book is indeed interesting. The book is pure devotion you can feel the authers love for the gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt. <BR>Im giving it 4 stars	2002-12-28

Ok this is a good book but its not the best one out there. I did learn how to pronounce and understand some of the words with the help of this book and another one by the Schuelers. But their pentagram ritual and hexagram ritual is not that good. especially  their hexagram ritual as they put lets say the hexagram of air in the east. WRONG! when on a higher level as the hexagram ritual originally is the hexagram should be placed in the west. Let me explain when you want to stay on your earth realm and skry the east fine face east. But when you want to travel the watchtower of air you need to face west. This is because on the astral which is a higher less dense realm fire is in the east, earth is in the south, air is in the west, and water is in the north. Now for their pentagram ritual look at the star you thrace on your self it does not complete the circuit. an open circuit will not work right. When you need to do the LBRP or BRH follow the OTO or Golden Dawn way. As for their rituals I have done it. But as for me I prefer Sir Aleister Crowley's way. Now on to the good stuf. The book has accurate information. I have learned from this book and i do not regret buying this book. When a copy was stolen from me I brought another one regardless of the fact i am not a mere beginner in this system of magick. I also like the writting style of the Schuelers as they do not play loads of head games with the readers. Even though Enochian is a complicated system thet make it more easy to understand.	2002-12-28

It is user friendly and is good for both the beginner, intermediate and advanced prationers of Enochian Magick. This has helped me in some of my ceremonies when I wanted to speak only Enochian to lest say the Seniors. Unfortunatly I could not find a few words I wanted to use so I would say 98 percent was used in the Enochian language. But dont be fooled Enochian is not only &quot;the language of the Angels&quot; it is also a system of magick so you will eighter need a teacher or other books on this subject. This book is excellent as it is a companion to any book you buy which deals with the subject of Enochian magick. Lon Milo Duquette makes a wonderful introduction by sharing his experience with the reader. He realy brings the book to life. This is one of the better books on the subject of Enochian. You will also find the Enochian keys which are very important in the Enochian magickal system.	2002-12-28

The only beef i have with this book is that she wrote all the offerings in spanish! Like I understand spanish! Even my friend from Ecudar did not understand the dialect. But Ms. Wippler reveals very good information and the legends of each Orisha. She gives you each Orisha's color(s), number(s) and day(s). This is the book to get if you are interested in the Orishas. Its not at all about the religion of Santaria its all about the Orishas. This book and Santaria by the same auther makes a good pair. This is a very good book on the Orishas.	2002-12-27

Im glad she reveals a lot of the stuff that is written in spanish. Though I also realize that eighter she made a few mistakes in her book orshe was deliberatly mislead with some of the information. She does give a crate load of information on the religion and beliefs of Santaria. If you are interested in Santaria or you are just curious about it than this should be your first book on the subject. Also her other book The Power Of The Orishas is pretty good as well. In her book Santaria she gives you information about some of the major orishas like Oshun, Chango, Yemaya, Elegua and more. She discusses the taboos and unfortunatly the macho part of it. Unfortunatly it is true a woman can not achieve the same high ranks a man can even though she can reach a centain rank on a Santera (priestess) a man can rise above her to higher ranks. If you are a gay man you can only reach the same rank a woman can. There are some things she did not mention like a woman can not sacrifice animals even as a Santera unless A) she has a warrior Orisha that rules her head or B) she is past menapause. To me thats a load of BS made up by men but thats the religion. Maybe one day it will change. But back to the book she is the only auther that i know of that revealed a lot years ago with her writtings. I brought this book years back and I will never give it away.	2002-12-27

Although its too simple for the more advanced this book is wonderful for those who are just beginning to learn witchcraft/Wicca. this is also good for those who have studied Magick and Wicca but it still is aimed for the beginner. It is a very good book and well written. By the end of this book Raven Grimassi teaches a little bit on working with your dreams and creating a dream gate for those who are interested in this, than this will be a good primer for you.	2002-12-27

The information is on target. Its not a big book, but for its sized it has a good amount of information. The auther knows her stuff. I cant stand it when people write about Kali and have no idea what they are talking about and believe me people I see it often. Kali is not all about destruction, or hexing, or the end of time. Shes not just a goddess in her &#34;Crone phase&#34; Shes not just a Goddess of the moon. Kali is used for many things even for healing. In her Bhadra Kali aspect shes a young virgin. But some people do not know this about her. If there's one complaint about this book is that sometimes the author can get off the subject of Kali. But regardless all the information is informative and wonderful. Its well researched. Its not as devotional as Kali by Elizabeth U Harding but its definitely a compliment to her book as well as to the book Kali Puja. I recommend all three.	2002-12-27

The secrets are still safe. Maybe one day the public will know, then again maybe not. Is this book still worth it? Oh yes. Raven Grimassi is one of a kind with the Italian tradition of Strega (Strega=Witchcraft) He made up his own tradition the Araidian tradition from an older tradition. Here in this book you will learn about the history of the witchcraft of Tuscany and Italy. He teaches about the diffrent aspect of the Goddess Diana. He also teaches about her consort Dianus. He gives out wonderful rituals and spells. He also gives a bit of info on the Lasa and Lare (the fairey folk) and how to make your own Lara and Lasa shrine. This is a good primer on Italian Witchcraft and wonderful for the beginners of the Craft as well. The auther does a wonderful job.	2002-12-27

This is ment for the beginning student. Her other book To light a Sacred Flame is good but in a lame fashion. I would reccomend both. the To ride a Silver broom Stick for the Novice and The To Light a Sacred Flame for the Intermediate. In this book To Ride A Silver Broomstick she presents the chapters as lessons. She gives good Ritual scripts and outlines so you may write your own. This can be trickey for the beginner. This book is also aimed at the solitary practioner as well. Sometimes it can be hard to find a good teacher so this book can help improvise as one. But the best teacher of all is experience. I have read and worked with this book many years ago and it works! This is a book that I do reccomend for the beginning student in Wicca and Witchcraft. There are important things in this book the the novice student should learn. Also she gives some pretty solid and sound advice on meeting with other witches and webweaving. She also shares some of her experiences as well. This is actually very good for the novice. I have learned from it way back when. The only thing I find shes way off is with the color black. So take the information there with a grain of salt.	2002-12-27

This book explains a lot. I have benn a magickal person for over 15 years and I enjoyed this book. Be aware this book is not on the hermetics or Thelema it is on the ogdodic tradition. I would recommend this book to anyone on any path of magick. Unlike some authers Denning and Phillips do not mess with the readers head. Instead they make things as clear as possible. Its mostly a lecture book so if you are looking for loads and loads of rituals you wont find it in here. But nevertheless it is a serious book, one that will help you understand the powers of magick more better. Also the book is also great since there is no useless dribble.	2002-12-26

Nor does it follow the rede made up by Gerald Gardner \\"an it harm none, do as ye will\\" It does not claim to be Vudu. The ingredients were not hard for me to find. I am a Ceremonial Magician and Witch (not wiccan by a long shot) I found this book to be very useful. Hey I even liked the Catholic stuff as I grew up in a Catholic household. This is defenitly a good spell book for pagans and non pagans. Hey if the Catholic stuff bothers you then just substatute pagan ideas for the Catholic ones. I actually thought this book was going to reek but was I ever wrong. The spells use plenty of candles and herbs, so if youre into that then this book of spells is the one to get. Ok His style is not much diffrent from Raymound Bucklands style so if you like Mr. Bucklands stuff you may just want to get this book.	2002-12-26

In lesson 7 the olympic/planetary seals are totally messed up. Meaning he assinged Hagith (venus to the the seal of Phalec (mars) and so on and so forth. Now to the experienced magician they could spot this right away, but the beginner will have absolutly no clue that there is a mistake here. Now it does not matter if this is the authers fault or the editor's fault there is a mistake. Otherwise the book is very, very good but not excellent. I give the first edition four stars. Plus the talismans are ok I like the way he describes a way on how to make talismas and amulets in a pagan way.It has pretty good info on the subject of amulets and talismans. If you are interested in making talismans get Making Talismans by Nick Farrell. This may be the only book you may need for powerful and postive magick using talismans and amulets. <BR>The second edition is much better where the mistake is corrected. But the auther from what I read did not mention there was a mistake in the first edition. Now on to the more postive review. The book is excellent for those who are interested in Ceremonial Magick. It deals with the magick of the Golden Dawn tradition. The chapters are divided in lessons. There are a total amount of 11 lessons. There is information of the Qabalah and the Tree of Life. He gives many rituals throughout this book, including the ritual of the pentagram, the hexagram ritual, the rose cross ritual and much more. The Watchtower ritual he gives is a more simplified version although very effective. You will find a lesson on sex magick here as well (you may not want to have your youngster read read chapter 10). In lesson 9 you will learn a bit on the Goetia. Also you will learn how to make some of the tools used in CM. Although he does give a brief history on wi! tchcraft and the oppersion of it throughout time this book does not have anything to do with Wicca at all.You will learn about talismans and amulets and how to create your own. You will learn so many thing from this book. This is suitable for the beginner who knows nothing about magick and is suitable for those who know about magick and has a lot of experience and wants to get into Ceremonial Magick. This book also makes a wonderful reference as well. Also I would like to mention that the second edition has a section on the frequently asked question on magick as well. Also at the end of each lesson this is refering to the first and second editions there are questions at the end of each chapeter about each lessons. I find this book to be valuable and intelligently written. This book is a hot seller the first edition has over a 100,000 copies in print! This is a book that I seriously recommed to anyone who is interested in learning CM. Kraig did great work with this! one!<BR>Five stars for the 2nd edition *****	2002-12-24

I have seen no book on incenses, oils and such as great as this one. Anyone can do make these recipes, and I mean anyone. He even teaches you how to empower everything you make. Of sourse I knew how do do this for many years now, but for the beginner this is crucial. There is so many oils, sachets, potions, powders, incenses, soaps and tinctures to make here. If you want to know how to make any type of astrological oil its in here. If you want to know how to make Pele incense or Isis incense its in here! For those of you who want to learn how to make your own incenses and such or for those of you who are looking for more recipes, do not pass up this book. This is a true gem. Although I am not crazy about the title, how can anything be complete? in that respect the book is misleading. But its still a wonderful book to own.	2002-12-21

Hyatt, Ph.D.<br />Does Enochian Magick make you want to pull the hair out of your head because it is a complicated system? Then you may want to pick up the book Enochian Sex Magick even though Enochiana can be a complicated system Lon Duquette and Chistopher Hyatt make it more easier to understand. They clear up the publishing mistakes of the past and give you a basic Enochian dictionary in the back. They put in a lot of the works of Crowley but they make comments on it to help those who find Crowley complicated or who are just learning about the Enochian system of Magick. They also include some very important work that Crowley wrote Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh (Enoch in Hebrew). This book gives out the fundamentals in an understandable user friendly way. Also they give you hints on things that will help your learning to become much more smoother. Also there are important illustrations in here as well. This is a book that will require to be read again and again from tim! e to time and also it makes a nice reference as well. Also the authers add their own experiences with Enochian magick as well. By the end of this book they give you a basic example of sex magick. Also you will find the Ritual of the pentagram & the Hexagram ritual  and not the kind of ... ritual that the Schulers pulled off eighter. My only real big ole complaint about this book is why the heck did they make this book so short? I wish they added more since I really love this book! My sugestion to the authers would be to make another Enochian book! The book is 162 pages long and I doubt the serious magician who is interested in Enochian magick would find this gem disapointing. Well we all have our opinions on whats is good but I love this one. I will tresure this one until it falls apart.<BR>out of a possible 5 stars this one gets all of them.	2002-12-20

The information on the Mahavidyas is well researched and correct. the only thing about David Kinsley is that for the most part according to him Kali is wild and destructive. But he does give very good information about her. Many who are into goddess religion and spirituality have no clue about the Mahavidyas. So if you are interested in the Hindu Goddesses you will be pleased with your purchase of this wonderful book. Also he includes some real nice illustrations of the Gooddesses. The Mahavidyas are independent Goddesses, if they are with a male God, the male divinity is eighter in a submissive or in a humiliating position. But usually the Mahavidyas are seen without the male deities. I have seen Kali without Shiva. I have this book and I love it.	2002-12-15

Dont get me wrong its a nice tradition but it has nothing to do with Sicialian Strega which is kept as a guarded secret. So far there is no book that has published these secrets... So if the pantheon of the Strega calls to you or the way of the Strega is right for you than this is the closet you will get to this tradition.

(even though they were not gay) <BR>This book goes deep into the Goddess Kali in her many aspects of Kali names such as Shyama Kali, Maha Kali, Raksha Kali and more. This book tells of her benign side (Dakashin) and her terrible aspect (Smashan or Vama)<BR>It describes the daily worship and the special puja of Kali. It explains her symbols the reason why she is seen with 50 human <BR>severed heads and a girldle of arms. This book is truly for those who are devoted to the Mother Kali.<BR>The auther describes how life is in India and how the devotees act toward the Mother Kali.<BR>The book has many devotional prayers and writtings that were made to the Great Devi Kali.<BR>She has wrote about Kalis Goddess intoxicated saints Rama Krishna, Sarada Devi, Ramprasad, and many of the lives of the devotes of Ma Kali.<BR>This book will dispell any of the myths of what you heard of Kali, as Kali is greatly misunderstood by so many people. Kali is beyond good and<BR>evil she is pure love and will but make no mistake she is also she who creates and she who destroys. The auther has added some of the writtings from the Gospel of Sri RamaKrishna and some of his visions of the Mother is there as well.<BR>She also adds some information on Shiva and Tara as well. Ramprshad made no dstiction between Kali and Tara. Tara is so much like Kali in her Hindu wratful aspect. Tara is the next Mahavidya right after Kali. She also describes the life of Bamakhepa Taras goddess intoxicated saint.She also writes about the left hand tantricts (this is not an evil path of tantra) Left hand tantra defies whatis considdered morally right and is useful in free the enslaved mind from human made restrictions.Devotes and saints would sit on top of a corpse in a crematorium and go<BR>into deep traces and do other societies\\"unacceptable things\\" NO im not talking of human sacrifices. Also Elizabeth Harding writes about the Rani (Queen) who had the Dakashineswar temple built and what <BR>goes on there.There are many wonderful pictures in this book and rare ones as well. Rare because pictures are forbidden to be taken of the <br />inside of templesonly the temple officials can take them.  The Christians and the English<BR>rule could not pull the whole country away from the Hindu religion no matter how bad the tyranny became. This book is inspirational and one of<BR>pure beauty, it is a book of hope against struggle. The book delves into the mysteries of Kalima. In this book Kali is brought to life and dances<BR>with her laughter, you can feel the soirit of the Great Devi in this book. This book has been praised by many Hindu and Goddess <BR>devotees.

The author in this book can be annoying, irritating, obnoxious but truthful. He speeks about free will and how it is taking off us. That many people are like programed machines.  We are programmed from the very star by family, relatives, friends, peer pressure, Television, politics, work, religion. sometimes when we make a decision its based on those view and not our own. He also describes the vicious cycle of the family, you know how when you have someone in the family with troubles and the family is after this one person to get help, when this family member does get help and becomes better, the family gets all messed up again and tries to break this person down again. He also describes DOGMA and not just dogma from religion but from politics, peer pressure and so on. And he also describes how addictive it can be, and how when one person gets away from one dogma they go to another dogma. Dogma spelled backwards is.....Amgod...Am-god. He talks about dogma withdrawls and how society pushes its dogma onto others. As he adds when a child is raised in a family where the child is taught to feel guilty, self loathing, etc the brain density is less flexible than those children that are raised in a loving family enviroment. Also the shape of your brain also changes as to what you read! When you are thinking of saying something notice how your vocal cords move ever so slightly even though you dont say a word. Its true. He describes some Qabalah and tantra here and gives you some exercises to help you break out of this. There are some things that he gives that to me are obnoxious but thats what its supposed to be. To wake you up! Christopher Hyatt is a Thelemite he also tells a little bit about Aleister Crowley here. He also gives a brief description of the chackras as well. There are two nice introductions in this book one is by Israel Regardie and another introduction is by Robert Anton Wilson, ph.D. The book I am describing is the 4th edition of Undoing Yourself.	2002-12-07

KALI PUJA<BR>by Swami Satyanananda Saraswati and Shree Maa<br />For those of you who want to worship the Holy Mother as Kali this is a great book to get. It offers a traditional way of worshipping Kali. You will learn the mantras, the mudras, traditional worship and tantric offerings to Kali. It is written in Sanskrit, Roman phonetic translation, and in english. I do wish the Roman phonetic translation was more understandable. Also I wish that they listed all the things that are required for the diffrent sections of this book as well, otherwise its a wonderful book on the Worship of Kali. You can do this book all the way through which will take hours or do a chapter or two at a time. The chapters are: Kali Puja, Sankalpa, Ganesha Puja, Kali Dhyanam, Adya Stotram, Puja Naivdeya- Offerings of worship, Adya Kalikadevyah Shatanama Stotram, Kali Kavacam, Sri Kalisahasranama Stotram, Consecration of Tantric Offerings, Gharbha Dhana Viddhi, Mudras for Worship. The Mudras are hand signals that are used to call the diety into yourself are call forth the ancestors. The Ganesha Puju is a small chapter in calling Ganesha and worshipping him the son of the Divine to remove all obstacles and to announce your desire to worship Kali. Sometimes when i can not pronounce the mantras in the sanskrit I use the english translations mixed with the Sanskrit or should i say the Roman phonetic translations. <BR>From the back of the book<BR>Kali is the Goddess who takes away darkness. She cuts down all impurities, consumes all iniquities (evil) purifies Her devotess with the sincerity of Her Love. Now we can worship Her according to the ancient tradition. Kali puja is a treasure house of Her Wisdom. It contains abundance Kali's living tools for living: Her sattvic worship, Her Hundred Names, Her Thousand Names, Her Armor, the mantras for offering bhanga, alcohol, animal sacrifice and how to give birth to spiritual children. These offerings have great spirtual significance when preformed withthe mantras which explain the meanings and appropiate circumstances for such worship. Shree Maa, the Respected Holy Mother from Kamakhya in Assam, has devoted her entire life to the worship of the Divine Mother. Swami Satyananda Saraswati has translated numerous volumes of Samskrita Scriptures published in India and abroad, and both are teachers respected around the world. Kali Puja is presented in the original Samskrita, a Romanized phonetic transliteration, and a complete English Translation. This is without doubt the first time that many of these mantras have been translated from their original language. At last the rest of the world is invited more deeply into the mystery of the Divine Mother.<BR>This is a great book as now the secrets have been revealed! Finaly we the rest of this world can worship Ma Kali traditionally. There is no other book that I know of today that gives details into the worship of the Mother like this, at least not one that is published in English.<BR>Despite my two gievences with this book it deserves 5 stars	2002-12-06

THE MAGICAL PANTHEONS<BR>a golden dawn journal<BR>edited by  Chic and Sandra Cicero<br />This is one amazing and powerful book. Its useful for those on the path of Ceremonial Magick, Greek path of the Samothrace tradition, Celtic path, Faery path, Asatrue path, and other pagan paths. Its diffrent ideas and beliefs from diffrent authers. Each auther has contributed wonderfu information to make this book as wonderful as it is. Its a must. There is not a lot of ritual outline just lots of info. Once you read this you will find you will want to keep reading it over and over again. My favorite article in this book is from the Ciceros it had so much good information on goddesses and gods from diffrent panteons. I have to say once again the Ciceros has done it again with their writting and making a great journal. Its ecceltic and open minded.  Pat Zalewski had published a topic in this book that Mathers and Yeats had worked on but never published.  The Irish Pantheon is something that these two magicians of the Golden Dawn were working on. According to Zalewski he writes &quot;according to the Ithel Colquhoun in her book Sword Of Wisdom, a full or partial manuscript of the Mathers/Yeats colllaboration does exist, though it has never been published.&quot; also he goes on to write how the Norse pantheon was referred to quite often by the Golden Dawn. The one draw back by this auther is that he writes about these deities as if they are dead and gone. This is quite untrue at least for me. Also the work that Harvey Newstrom did on the article In The Beginning was the word was wonderful indeed. The Samothracian Fire by Steven Cranmer was good as well although in the consecration of the ring he does not give out the proper sigils.<BR>Here are the list of authers and their articles they contributed<BR>Gods and Humans--Chic and Sandra Cicero<BR>Pagans and Neo-Pagans--M. Isadora Forrest<BR>Samothracian Fire-- by Steven Cranmer<BR>The Ancient Ones of The Irish Faery-Faith--Kisma K. Stepanich<BR>In The Beginning Was The Word--Harvey Newstrom<BR>The Incomplete Mythological Pantheons of the Golden Dawn--Pat Zalewski<BR>Hebrew Hierarchical Names In Briah--James A. Eshelman<BR>Osiris And Christ--John Michael Greer<BR>Do the Gods Exist?--Donald Micheal Kraig<BR>As you can see there are some pretty well known authers iin this book. It has a diverse perspective on the subjects of the gods and goddesses. Of corse it does not cover every pantheon but its a great book none the less. The Ciceros has written many wonderful books and they are not some pretend to know it all and arm chair magician. No quite the opposite is true. If you are interested in the magick of the Golden Dawn than I would suggest getting some of their books.	2002-12-06

ISIDORA FORREST<br />Isis the Great Mother, Isis the Goddess of Magick, Isis the Lady of wisdom these titles fit her suitably. M. Isidora does a beautyful job of describing the Great Isis. She describes her worship in ancient times. How in the ancient world her worship spread throughout Egypt, Rome, Greece, Romania and many other parts of Europe. She tells the myths of Isis, her history, and how through out the ancient world and to the present about how people love and worship her. Isis is the magician, the initiater, the warrior queen, the goddess of those who travel by water, the Goddess of mothers, the Goddess of children, the Goddess of love, the Goddess of marriages, The protectress, she is this and many more things. The auther describes the plight of women in the ancient world and the history of the queens of Egypt and the famous queens the Ptolomy royal family. She describes many of Isis' aspects even her Black aspect. She tells! how the Golden Dawn and many other famous magicians adopted Her.She describes people's love and experience with the goddess Isis. She also describes how Isis became a prominent Goddess in the ancient world.  She has some info on Nepthys, Osiris, Anubis, Set, Ra, Horus in this book as well. She has two parts to this book one is the information on Isis the second part is the rituals that allow you to dedicate yourseld to Isis step by step. The second part you start out as the votary of Isis, the next step is becomming the handmaiden or servent of Isis, when you are ready you become the magician of Isis, then you become the prophet/ess of Isis. Even if you have been her priest/ess of Isis for a long time or a priest/ Goddess there is nothing wrong with starting the rituals as a votary (where there is humility there is no room for the ego) The rituals in this book are lovely. The Goddess Isis is alieve in this book! For those of you who are witches/magicians you may enjoy th! is book, for those who are interested inlearning about Isis or the Egyptian path than this is a great selection. For those who want to have more contact with the Goddess and the feminine power of the universe than this is a great book for you. The autho!r's love for Isis really shows by her dedication to this huge 624 page book. This book is one you probably will not be lending out at all! M. Isidora Forrest  did a wonderful job with Isis Magic! She must have spent a very long time writting Isis Magic. This book is a true masterpiece. May Isis bless the author!<br />Kalimir~Kalamere	2002-12-05
