This is one of the few exceptions in the last few years.<br />Face is tedious at best.  And I don't particularly mind tedious if there's some decent writing behind it.  Sadly, Face wasn't compelling enough for me to finish.  Its quite obvious that Lebbon has talent.  He's got enough praise and awards to make me think he's definitely got some talent going for him.  But sadly, Face doesn't display any of it.  Sure, his characters are decent but I had a hard time liking or empathizing with any of them.  Brand, our intrepid bad guy, is just a mystery.  He's not well developed enough to hate or even to scare the reader.<br />I've got a copy of The Nature of Balance by Lebbon on my \\"to read\\" shelf.  Its been there awhile.

Throughout my time spent reading this collection (which admittedly was brief as this is a short collection), I found myself flipping to the blurbs on the back extolling the \\"heart\\" and \\"compassion\\" of the stories.  And I've got to say, I really think a lot of people read an awful lot into this collection.<br />The stories themselves are pointless.  There's no emotional payoff as far as I can see.  And how many three-legged dogs do we have to read about?  I realize there's probably a far larger population of three-legged dogs running (or limping) around the world than I would believe but by the time we hear about the last three-legged dog, the idea is tired and worn out.  <br />Pointlessness is okay by me.  I'd hate it if everything had an emotional punch.  But what bothered me most about this collection (and the praise for it) was the quality of the actual writing itself.  It was just not good.  It wasn't awful but high school freshmen could be expected to string these sentences together.  I saw very few signs of true writing talent.  <br />Strange ideas are great but without solid writing skills they're worthless.  Like many of the dogs he writes about, this collection just wobbles around on three-legs and never really struts as advertised.  I'd advise all but the most desperate of readers to pass this by.	2003-05-28
US	52526368	R20B0HUQ4QUTH0	0449006530	541544893	Midnight Voices	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Saul - Midnight Voices	With Midnight Voices, Saul continues the fascination with New York he introduced in his last effort, The Manhattan Hunt Club.  Yet, unlike that novel and most of his output since The Blackstone Chronicles (a must-read novel), Midnight Voices is quite well done.<br />Centering on a creepy Manhattan apartment building, Saul takes a page out of Rosemary's Baby and delivers an eerie, disturbing tale.  While the plot is strong, for the most part, it was easy to predict its direction and ultimate outcome early on in the novel.  In addition, Saul missed a good opportunity to expand the story to include plot lines only uncovered in the novel's epilogue.  Unlike many contemporary thrillers or horror novels that run on for too long with too little substance, Saul had a lot to work with and he didn't fully utilize it all.<br />Despite these flaws, Midnight Voices is a fast-paced, creepy thriller worth the few hours it will take readers to finish it.	2003-03-25

But lately, having discovered John Sanford's Prey series, I decided they weren't all bad.  Hence my discovery of Lincoln Rhyme and The Bone Collector.<br />If the idea of a brilliant bed-ridden quadriplegic forensic investigator doesn't break the mold of normal crime novels, the content truly will.  The focus here is on forensic evidence - how its gathered, how its processed and the clues it yields.  And the results are fascinating.  Of course, the fact that the characters are well developed and engaging only enhances this well thought out novel.<br />The Bone Collector is an excellent novel.  Don't miss it.	2003-03-25

While not as good or impressive as his Prey novels, Sandford delivers a strong and entertaining novel.<br />Readers are treated to a fast-paced techno-thriller that doesn't seem nearly as dated as previous efforts.  Yet little new information is revealed about our heroes.  One of Sandford's most impressive talents with respect to the Prey novels is writing a back story just as engaging as the main body of the novel - familiar characters and places come back and are developed, issues and questions are resolved.  Unfortunately this series just doesn't have that strength going for it. <br />All-in-all, however, its an entertaining read.	2003-03-25

I've read a few King novels - mainly earlier (and shorter) ones - but I've never fallen head over heels for his work.  Until, perhaps, Bag of Bones.<br />I was informed by my wife, a King fan, that Bag of Bones is somewhat atypical but did showcase his writing talent.  And I agree.  You get what you're promised - a haunted love story, according to the back flap of my copy.  The novel is often slow yet the writing is magnificent.  King's first person narration is enough to keep you plowing through even the most tedious chapters.  His humor shines through and he paints a picture of small town life that's believable and appealing.<br />So now I'm thinking that, despite having read some previous novels, I may have finally discovered King.	2003-03-25

Since then, I've experienced good and bad sides of Bentley Little.  Little is truly talented - he has a gifted imagination and a laid back style of writing.  There are usually a few good scares and some genuinely humorous moments in all his novels.  Unfortunately, The Town is not one of his better efforts.<br />The Town is quite simply not well written or well executed.  Dialog is just plain dumb, ideas and plot lines are muddled and the book is just not that scary.  And while the source of the evil is kind of interesting, it really just sounds silly by the end of the novel.<br />Little's written better novels - try The Association or The Store before wandering through the pot-holed, badly mapped streets of The Town.	2003-03-25

The story moves slowly - and that would be okay if it weren't for the poorly developed characters and complete lack of suspense - and I found myself expecting, at some point, something jarring to happen, for the plot to really kick in.  And it never did.  Even going into the final 100 pages, I hoped that something was going to happen to redeem the time I'd invested in the first 300 pages.  There was no payoff.  And the ending?  Don't get me started.  Its as if Grisham, like me, had just had enough and stopped working.<br />I've no doubt that there are better Grisham novels out there.  I just sincerely wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one.	2003-02-14

What do you expect to happen when two close friends, one male, the other female, shack up with each other?  Unfortunately, Just Friends didn't deliver on its promise...at least, until it was too late.   There's always a certain amount of...what's the word...angst in friends-destined-to-be-lovers comedies like these.  But because our future couple clearly wasn't even interested in one another until late in the novel, that angst was missing from the first three quarters of the book.<br />That said, this was a well-written and amusing novel.  The characters were well established and portrayed, dialog was crisp and realistic and the settings executed perfectly.  Overall, Just Friends was a very entertaining read.    Just a little light on the angst.	2003-02-14

Critically, Meltzer is not the world's greatest writer but he does have a knack for coming up with intriguing and entertaining stories that keep readers turning pages.  Millionaires is just that - entertainment.  It's a quick read despite its length.  The characters are well developed given the category of fiction this falls into (thrillers typically don't excel in character development), dialogue is swift and realistic and there exists a great sense of humor and playfulness about the novel.<br />Overall, Millionaires is a good, quick and entertaining read.	2003-02-14

What I got was more intricately plotted yet yielded fewer thrills.  I was disappointed.<br />I've never read anything by Klavan and The Uncanny doesn't exactly inspire confidence.  The premise is uninspired - American movie producer who's got some health problems (to say the least) ends up hunting down the answers to an old ghost story in England.  It also becomes - of course - a somewhat sappy boy-meets-girl story.<br />I think what truly bothered me most about the novel was the portrayal of the main character.  He lived up to every stereotype of the typical American movie producer.  Worse, he adopted these qualities only after the first quarter of the book had passed.  As an American (and I acknowledge that many of these traits can be somewhat accurate, but are rarely seen in one single individual) I was put off by the portrayal.  The whole John Wayne, movie producer, father-was-a-movie-star-cowboy, protect-the-women, suffer-in-silence hero thing was just a little too over-the-top.  And while this character is overdeveloped, the others are quite poorly developed. <br />I don't think Klavan did himself or his readers any favors by making this more of a \\"literary thriller\\".  It was just slower and more weighed down.	2003-02-14

Like a Catcher in the Rye for the 21st century (set, however, in the 70's), Perv takes an honest look at adolescence, the perils of family life, and the tail end of the days of hippies and free love.  Stahl obviously has talent and he uses it well here.	2003-01-15

In that respect I was not at all disappointed.  Fountain Society is a cookie-cutter thriller.  There's nothing about the novel that distinguishes it from hundreds of others.  The plot is decent and interesting but nothing special.  The characters are fairly two-dimensional and their dialogue is nothing special.  In fact, one of the few things I found unique about the novel was the setting. <br />Don't get me wrong - Fountain Society is not a BAD novel.  It's just not overwhelmingly impressive either.  It's entertainment.  Nothing more.	2003-01-15
US	52526368	R334WSNHCHEDYO	0449225046	475389971	Black Lightning	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Saul - Black Lightning	In looking over previous reviews I've seen words and phrases like \\"point of view\\" and \\"character development.\\"  This leads me to believe that people are either expecting too much of Mr. Saul or they're over-thinking the book.  Saul writes horror and thriller novels - he does not attempt to reach the modern literary equivalent of War and Peace each time he puts pen to paper.  If that's what he was trying to accomplish, he would be an astonishing failure.  To the contrary, he's actually quite successful and good at what he does.  He writes entertaining, escapist thrillers that are, at best, amusing and, at worst, a cheap thrill.<br />Black Lightning is no different than previous Saul novels although it deals less with the traditional supernatural horror elements and focuses on fairly standard \\"serial killer\\" fare.  But there are problems.  The novel is probably 100 pages too long, the ending is poor and the overall plot is merely a slightly enhanced version of hundreds of novels already on bookshelves.  <br />Saul has written better - check out The Blackstone Chronicles.  There are better novels and authors but there are also worse.  Saul is, as always, middle of the road.	2002-11-14

But he sure does write the occasional fun and entertaining novel.  Reading The Ignored was refreshing for me after struggling through his awful new release, The Return a few months back.  The Ignored is stylistically different from other novels, as its told from the first person.  And while many of his other novels focus on evil inherent in everyday places or groups (The Association, The Town, The House, etc), The Ignored focuses on broader issues.  Instead of targeting chain stores or homeowners associations, Little takes aim at society as a whole and, specifically, the way in which we all live and work.<br />As he proves in The Ignored, Little is able to write a great novel when he puts his mind to it.  While its not my favorite Little novel, The Ignored certainly is among his best.	2002-11-07

There's a somewhat cohesive overriding story here but it's the pieces of that story that make the book wonderful.  This might be an example of the parts being greater and more important than their sum.<br />Drury has a fantastic wit, a true gift at characterization, and an astonishing eye for emotional detail.  I found myself in local bookstores trying to find Drury's other novels before I had even managed to finish The Black Brook.  Yet, despite the talent displayed here, the novel failed to pack the final emotional punch of which I thought it capable.  The end was a let down, but in hindsight, those minor miracles were worth it.	2002-10-28

The Traveling Vampire Show is no exception.  A coming of age story, Laymon populates \\"Anywhere USA\\" with a well-developed cast of characters and throws in a few thrills for good measure.  Island still remains my favorite Laymon novel but The Traveling Vampire Show runs a close second.	2002-10-25

I'm afraid that I can't honestly continue the string of rave reviews.  Every character in the novel was flat and few were likable.

Sandford got the series back on track with the gripping Winter Prey and that momentum is obviously still working for him with Night Prey.  As usual (and forgive me if I sound like a broken record), the subplot is just as interesting as the main story itself.  The language is straightforward, the characters well developed and the action quick.  Night Prey is an entertaining and valuable addition to the Prey series.	2002-10-25

While I dislike calling it \\"experimental fiction\\" - this usually implies style over substance from which this novel did not suffer - this novel is a prime example of what an author can create when abandoning traditional novel structure.  Not only does Dunn draw the reader in through his absorbing story, but also through the challenge he set for himself - to tell a story using a rapidly disappearing alphabet.<br />Ella Minnow Pea is a quick but satisfying, absorbing read.  Not only is it a satire about the world in which we live but its also a celebration of language.  So, you're thinking all this sounds rather boring?  Think again.	2002-10-21

Because of this unique setting, Lightning on the Sun becomes a highly-charged thriller.  What truly separates this novel from others in the same genre is the fact that Bingham is obviously familiar with the historical, political and social intricacies of daily life in Cambodia.  Add to that well developed characters and you're left with a powerful, fascinating story.	2002-10-18

Thankfully, I read The Empress File first, as it is a far better book.  Had I read The Fool's Run first, I'm afraid I would have been left with a poor impression of the characters, especially LuEllen who was an interesting, exciting character in The Empress File but was merely a cocaine-snorting burglar in this installment.  In addition, The Empress File characterized LuEllen and Kidd as essentially moral in what they did.  Sure, they were criminals but they were doing what they did for the right reasons.  In The Fool's Run, that's not so clear and causes them to be somewhat less redeemable.<br />All-in-all, this might be the least engaging Sandford novel I've read thus far.  It is, however, entertaining enough to keep the pages turning.	2002-09-30

Thunderhead joins Riptide as a well-executed archeological adventure and thriller.<br />As always, Preston and Child develop an almost irresistible mystery and compelling characters.  The action is swift and relentless, the setting authentic and mysterious, and the background, as always with these guys, based in fact.  <br />Overall, Thunderhead provides an entertaining, quick read with an age-old mystery impossible to resist.	2002-09-30

Fortunately or unfortunately, Gordie finds he can't ignore his journalistic curiosity (or his hormones for that matter) when a mystery slowly begins to unravel around him.  <br />Its difficult to stress how wonderful this novel is.  It has both humor and heart and left me speechless.  Shreve is obviously a talent to watch.  His characters were rich and well developed, the suspense subtle, and the end result was powerful.  Not to be missed.	2002-09-17

With Winter Prey, Sandford relocates Davenport yet again, this time to the frozen countryside of Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Sandford's last Prey novel, Silent Prey, tried something similar, moving Davenport to NYC but it was, unfortunately, not at all successful.  Luckily Winter Prey proves to be a much better installment in the series.<br />Much of the action and plot of the book follows Sandford's \\"prey format\\" and Sandford doesn't disappoint in Winter Prey.  Quite a bit of the appeal in these stories is derived from the evolving back-story and the development of Davenport.  And while Winter Prey largely ignored recurring characters seen in previous novels, Sandford's characters were likable and I can only hope that some of them return.<br />Overall, if you felt burned by Silent Prey, you'll feel much better after Winter Prey.  A real page-turner.	2002-09-17

Despite the fact that I had several of his earlier novels sitting unread on my bookshelves, I was excited to see The Return hit shelves.  I immediately picked it up and started reading.  I'll admit to being mildly interested in the beginning however The Return quickly became tedious - at best.  <br />I don't expect realism in a horror novel - let me get that out of the way upfront.  Little, however, has consistently written novels in which normal, everyday people and places have become gradually sinister - haunted houses (The House), homeowners associations (The Association), discount store chains (The Store).  Because of this subtlety, I was surprised when The Return featured such blatantly outrageous action.  For example, while reading The Association, it was conceivable to me, in the manner in which it was presented, that residents of a community could be terrorized by an evil homeowners association and find themselves with little recourse.  Its more difficult for me to believe that, as was the case in The Return, entire towns could be wiped out across the Southwest with little more reaction from the country than a little bit of news coverage.  <br />The Return is the least enjoyable of the Little novels I've read so far.  In a shorter format, The Return would have been at home in his recently published collection of short stories, The Collection.  Its too bad - many of the short stories collected there would have been far more successful as novels than The Return.	2002-09-17

Davies' style of writing is quirky enough that it takes a few pages to settle into but its that quirky style that helps endear this novel to the reader.<br />Where Davies' excels is in his character development.  The characters are so richly constructed, its quite easy to become entangled in their lives.  I fell for Evie, despised Judith and wanted to punch Harry when he messed up (which he invariably did at every opportunity) yet I felt genuinely sorry for the guy.  Rarely do I get that involved in characters in a novel like this.  I think it's a true testament to the overall quality of the novel.<br />Viva la Evie...viva el Frog King!	2002-09-11

I wasn't quite sure what he meant so when I saw copies of the Fletch novels in my local bookstore, I couldn't resist.  Admittedly, while the novel and the movie have quite a few things in common, the novel is far superior.<br />The plot of both the movie and the book are essentially the same but the genius of the novel is the crisp, concise dialog.  Mcdonald relies not on narrative but dialog to convey the majority of the characterization and action.  With Fletch, he crafts a dialog-driven, witty and unconventional mystery.  <br />For those who enjoy mysteries or simply want to read a wonderfully written book, Fletch is a must.	2002-09-05

Unlike some of his other works of horror or suspense, this is pretty much a straight murder mystery.  Because of the toned-down plot, Laymon's writing is somewhat milder as well.  Not too much gore to be had, fewer random acts of violence and much less sex.  Yet Among The Missing is still a wonderfully entertaining, quick read.  Not Laymon's best - for that, read Island - but definitely one to check out.	2002-08-23

It seems like a lot of the time, mysteries and suspense are written for the lowest common denominator - easy language, a plot that's just engaging enough to keep a reader moving, a few stereotypical characters that readers feel comfortable with, etc.  Ridley's Everybody Smokes In Hell, however, provides a refreshing voice in crime fiction.<br />The plot isn't much to write home about.  Down and out youth in L.A. stumbles into a bad situation and finds himself on the run from all kinds of nasty folks.  The way this plot is executed is amazing.  The characters Ridley comes up with are unique and colorful, each with unique motivations subtly sketched by the author.  Dialogue is fresh and crisp, presented the way people talk, not just an author's bland translation.  Action is quick and descriptions show no restraint.  Often funny, sometimes heartbreaking, the story is an exceptional one.  Fiction's lucky to have an author like Ridley.  It's a reminder that there's more than cookie-cutter mysteries out there.	2002-08-23

Taking a normal situation and turning it upside down, eerily so, Levin blazed a trail for authors like Stephen King or Bentley Little.  Levin presents readers with the town of Stepford, a remote suburb away from the grind of big-town living.  Idyllic, inviting and almost utopian, Levin begins to introduce oddities, imperfections that lead both the protagonist and the reader to conclude that certain things aren't what they seem.  And of course, they're not.<br />After reading The Stepford Wives, I was immediately surprised at how much influence the novel obviously had on some more contemporary horror and suspense authors - Andrew Neiderman's Amnesia and Neighborhood Watch as well as Bentley Little's The Association owe a lot Levin's Stepford.	2002-08-19

The Collection shows off his penchant for the gory, the twisted, the perverse and the just plain strange.  Contrary to previous opinions, I don't really believe that Little is the \\"thinking man's horror writer.\\"  He's strictly entertaining.  His imagination, however, is unparalleled.  I've always enjoyed his novels and, while I'm not normally a fan of short story collections, I did get a kick out of The Collection.  Like all Little's work, it was a quick, entertaining read.  I didn't find it all that scary, just creepy and twisted.  Fine by me.  The Collection is not going to recruit new legions of fans or change anyone's mind about Little, positive or negative, but it is an interesting insight into some of the ideas running around in Little's mind - as scary as that prospect may be.	2002-08-09

One thing that Sandford does so well is develop the life of Lucas Davenport - his life and the characters in it are almost as interesting as whatever crime he's working on.  Silent Pray stripped away that detail, putting Davenport in New York City and only briefly visiting characters we've grown to know in previous novels.  Perhaps it was a good move to break the formula but it wasn't entirely successful.  But like all of Sandford's Prey novels, it was entertaining and worth the time.	2002-07-25

With it, he established himself as a bold, fearless writer with an incredible sense of humor.  I wish he was able to write a novel that consistently exhibited these same strong qualities.  <br />Teeth is a fine, funny novel, its reasonably well written, the humor is brilliant and his characters are well developed.  Yet there's something that keeps this from becoming a truly great novel.  Perhaps is Gallagher's reliance on 90's clichés (yet Coupland's been able to pull it off and Bret Easton Ellis has used the entire decade of the 80's to his advantage).  Gallagher satirizes the decade, its culture and its music with fake brand names, bands and magazines that are, perhaps, a little too close to their real counterparts (Rage Against the Chili Peppers?).  <br />Overall, Teeth is good.  Its worth reading and you won't regret picking it up.  Contemporaries like Douglas Coupland, Brett Easton Ellis, and Dave Eggers have produced similar - probably better - novels but Gallagher's talent is well worth experiencing.	2002-07-24

Its well written, quite funny and poignant at the same time.  All of us have a little underachiever in us - some more than others - and this is a perfect testament to that.  My only complaint is that the book just ends.  There's no real conclusion, no defining moment in which our hero mends his ways or comes to any profound realization.  It just ends.  All-in-all, a fine novel.	2002-07-24

And he's headed to jail after one more night of celebration. During the course of the story, we're introduced to his girlfriend and his two best friends. In 210 pages, I felt like I knew these characters, truly understood them. This is no small accomplishment for any writer. The characters are all tragically flawed, especially Monty. But as flawed and pathetic as they are, they're likable and they seem more realistic for all those faults.<br />I go through a lot of books but there are only a few that truly astonish me.

The blurb for this novel makes it sound as though there's a mysterious house responsible for a series of freak, horrific events occurring all over the world.  That's true but its not until halfway through the novel that we see the first reference to the house.  I found myself wondering if somehow the wrong blurb was printed on the book.  Then there's the resolution to the novel - or lack thereof.  Too many things go without explanation.  Too little is resolved.  Its as though the author just gave up.  <br />All-in-all, the book is good.  Characters are well developed.  The author's style is easy, fast and action packed.  However, I can't help but think he was planning a much larger work - something about twice the length - but ran out of steam a third of the way through.  From the last chapter of the book, I can't help but think that there's a sequel in the works.  Maybe it would tie up all the loose ends.	2002-07-10

While not as strong as the first, Rules of Prey, Shadow Prey is an amusing thriller.  The plot, as always, is well conceived and the action is great.  What I believe is most unique about these novels is the degree to which we're given insight into the main character's life.  The background story is almost as important and interesting as the main case Davenport's working on.  Its interesting to see how this character evolves.<br />Overall, Shadow Prey is great fun.	2002-07-05

Eyes of Prey is slightly better than its predecessor, Shadow Prey and shows detective Lucas Davenport at his most vulnerable.  A point I've made before:  the sub-plots in the Prey novels revolving around Davenport are almost as interesting as the cases and crimes he's working to solve.

It shifts from a murder trial, in which the main character is the defense attorney, to ghost story to urban legend.  The main character himself is sleazy, unlikable and incompetent and I gave up on finding anything redeeming about him after the first 50 pages.  That said, its difficult to care what happens to him.  The \\"lady in the lake\\" legend is an element that never pans out for Pyper and shouldn't have made it past the editor.  It merely adds static to an already precarious plot.  <br />Overall, its obvious that this was a first novel and it makes a good case for the use of editors.  Sentence fragments and passive voice abound.  If the story itself was better, it would be easier to forgive these things but, alas, its not.  <br />Leave it sitting on the shelf.  There are better things to read out there.	2002-07-05

While his science fiction series, Hyperion, remains my favorite piece of work, his horror novels are excellent.<br />Summer of Night follows a group of friends through the horror that was the summer of 1960 in the small, rural community of Elm Haven, Illinois.  Simmons paints a vivid, lifelike portrayal of young boys growing up in a small community and he exhibits his gift for excellent characterization.<br />I've always found it difficult to be truly surprised or scared by anything I read - sure, some things are unsettling or creepy but rarely am I actually startled.  Summer of Night scared me to death in parts.<br />Sure, it could be said that this is a run of the mill horror novel, similar to King's many coming of age novels from the same genre.

His science fiction isn't always \\"hard sci-fi\\" - he often prefers to rely on strong ideas and characters to drive his stories.  He seems to have fun with his novels, not allowing himself to take his characters or ideas too seriously.<br />While Ancient Shores revolves around the discovery of an ancient craft of unknown origin in a field in North Dakota, it's not the scientific discovery that McDevitt focuses on but the effect that such a discovery has on the people involved a well as the larger societal, technological, and economic implications.  In addition, McDevitt examines the plight of the Native Americans in the region and portrays their strong belief in the sanctity of their land.  <br />Ancient Shore ends with a bang...some might say a cheesy bang but its an emotionally satisfying conclusion to a well-done novel.	2002-06-05

But after finishing Island by Richard Laymon, it was nearly impossible not to pick up another one of his novels.  And while One Rainy Night doesn't match the achievement of Island, its still a great read.<br />The premise of the novel is simple:  after a racially motivated killing, a black rain begins to fall driving anyone exposed to it into a homicidal frenzy.  Following a small collection of people, Laymon illustrates the effects of the black rain and the actions taken to stop it.<br />Like Island, the characters are somewhat shallow but that's really not the point of his novels.  Laymon writes to entertain and he's ridiculously successful.  Above all, One Rainy Night is a lot of fun to read.  Think of it as a low budget horror movie in novel form.  <br />Laymon writes a good book - they're entertaining, easy and quick yet thoroughly engaging.  Definitely check this one out.	2002-06-05

It's not hard to figure out the components:  one demented killer, one detective, usually above the law with some interesting quirk or hobby that makes him unique, a love interest or two, the hero's haunted past...I think you get the idea.  I always wish that some writer somewhere would break out of that formula but very few do successfully.  But on occasion, a writer uses that formula to his advantage and just writes a darn good book.<br />Rules of Prey is the first novel in what has become a rather extensive series featuring Lucas Davenport, part playboy, part rogue cop, part vigilante.  And the Davenport character is a good one.  Throw in a generic psychopath playing the part of serial killer and you've got a decent but predictable thriller.<br />Readers of thrillers are familiar with portrayals of the bad guys and usually writers delve deeply into the motivations behind their actions.  One strange thing about Rules of Prey is that Sandford does not elaborate on the killer's motivations.  While I was curious what was driving him, I must say that I found the lack of childhood flashbacks and psychological ramblings refreshing.<br />Overall, the story was simple, neat and effective.  The writing was good, the characters far more developed than those normally encountered in this genre, the action fast paced and the outcome surprising.  I will definitely be continuing this series.	2002-06-04

But what I got was neither.<br />I'm normally a very quick reader, flying through books.  So I knew there was something wrong when it took me a week to read Abandon.  The problem wasn't me, it was the book.  Almost nothing happens in the novel.  It's slow moving and, quite frankly, boring.  Much of the narrative is repetitive, focusing on the inner turmoil a narrator we don't know enough about to care.  Characters are poorly developed, the action isn't well plotted and the entire book moves in fits and starts.  And as our narrator describes his \\"descent into hell\\" things only get more confused and more boring.<br />Desmond's attempt to write a more literary horror novel fails in almost every respect.

The way in which it was written seemed like an easy way out - its no great feat for any writer to narrate as an 18 year-old sex-obsessed kid.  And the story itself seemed juvenile at best, reminding me more of a low-budget slasher film, complete with jiggly, scantily clad scream-queens.  Like something you'd watch in junior high school at a slumber party.  But as I kept reading, I realized what a fun, well-done novel Island was.<br />Rupert (our intrepid narrator) has got a problem - he's marooned on an island with four beautiful women.  The only hitch is that their husband's are there as well.  Until they start disappearing, that is.  Before too long he finds himself in the enviable position of sharing a deserted island, alone, with four women.  And it would be great except for the fact that they're being hunted.<br />Island is a fun, quirky suspense novel but it has a dark side as well.  Drenched in sex, Island delves into the darker side of perversion from time to time.  Readers can expect to run across a few graphic and uncomfortable scenes.  All this, though, is combined to form an entertaining, engrossing novel.  Bottom line:  it's a lot of fun.  Don't miss it.	2002-05-17

Not that that's a bad thing - his novels are usually compelling and, at the very least, fun to read. Manhattan Hunt Club provides Saul fans with a different twist however. No supernatural occurrences, no possessed children, no haunted houses. Instead, Saul gives readers a pretty standard thriller.<br />As with most of Saul's novels, the characters are under-developed, the plot is straightforward, the action often intense but the outcome predictable. Manhattan Hunt Club is a simple novel yet the plot is interesting enough to draw readers in. I personally thought that Saul could have introduced a little more background about the NYC underground world. Additionally, as other reviews have pointed out, the coincidences in the novel were ridiculous. While the novel wasn't at all plausible, these coincidences made it seem even more ridiculous. <br />Overall, Manhattan Hunt Club is a fun read. Its not a fabulous novel, nor is it horrible. Just entertaining.	2002-05-13

Yet there are some similarities:  nameless (almost), young, male narrator; cute, quirky, attractive, young female character with whom the narrator is enamored; mystery; and the occasional unusual setting.<br />Sputnik Sweetheart follows the story of K, his love for the quirky Sumire, her attraction to the mysterious Miu and the mystery surrounding Sumire's disappearance on a remote Greek island.  Filled with plenty of angst, unrequited love and unrealized dreams, Sputnik Sweetheart is perhaps more introspective than many of Murakami's novels but it's no less enjoyable.  Murakami's sense of humor, despite the sullen subject matter, shines through and his overall style makes this a unique novel.	2002-05-08

Unfortunately the author bravely tries to pull off some time-travel surprises but only succeeds in making the last third of the book choppy and confusing.  It was a good idea but the execution wasn't great.  And if I see the Doctor described as \\"diminutive\\" again, I'm going to scream.

The Sparrow, however, is one of them.<br />I picked The Sparrow up soon after it was released after reading a brief review from an obscure source.  When I started reading the novel, I found it almost impossible to put down.  Mary Doria Russell's characters are well developed and the plot is intriguing.<br />There has been some criticism concerning the more science fiction oriented elements of the novel - that they're not complex or well thought out enough or that the technology is just plain silly.  And I'd have to agree to a point.  However, remember that Russell is not a science fiction writer.  She's an anthropologist by background.  By her own account, she didn't want to write a science fiction novel.  Instead she wanted to write a novel of first contact but she recognized that most of the traditional ways of accomplishing that had already been done. So she took the idea of Jesuit missionaries into space.<br />Sure, there are flaws.  Some of the novel is implausible.  Some of the novel is perhaps a bit too idealistic.  But the fundamental themes and messages of the novel outweigh any criticism.  The Sparrow is a fantastic book.  If you find yourself enjoying The Sparrow, make sure you have a copy of the sequel, Children of God, on hand.	2002-05-03

I was between books so I bought it, got it home and started on it right away.<br />Bones of the Moon is familiar territory for any readers who have read other Carroll novels.  Carroll deftly blends real life with fantasy to form his unique hybrid.  Unlike other books I've read by him, however, Bones of the Moon dragged a little bit.  And I'm not sure why.  By the time I reached the end, I was emotionally involved and was very pleased overall.<br />This or any other novel by Carroll is worth a read.  His imagination is unparalleled and its plain to readers that he enjoys what he does.  I think Carroll's books are, to adults, what the Narnia or Oz series were to us when we were kids.	2002-05-02
US	52526368	R2HHPHPBQNKHD	0671787454	609092345	The Girls He Adored	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Run of the Mill Thriller	With The Girls He Adored, Jonathan Nasaw has created a thoroughly evil serial killer in the style of Hannibal Lecter.  Fortunately, Nasaw is a more proficient writer than Thomas Harris.  On the other hand, while Nasaw does a great job characterizing Maxwell, the killer, he does a poor job with other characters.  He's able to present a complex character in Maxwell, complete with countless multiple personalities, but spends little time on other characters.  The other flaw is that the action is completely predictable.  While some of the characters' motivations are revealed over time and are somewhat surprising, the overall action doesn't deviate from standard thriller/suspense fare.  The Girls He Adored is neither great nor horrible.  It's an entertaining, quick read.  If that's all you're looking for, you'll be pleased with it.  If you're after anything deeper or more creative, look elsewhere.	2002-04-23

Finally, it was shoved in my hand and I received sufficient encouragement to read it.  And while it wasn't as great as I was lead to believe, it was a good, fast-paced, action-packed read.<br />For some strange reason, I generally shy away from typical private investigator/crime novels that involve recurring characters.  I was disappointed to find out that A Drink Before The War was the first volume in the Kenzie/Gennaro series of novels.  But I kept reading and thoroughly enjoyed the book.<br />It's a brief novel, lasting only 300 pages and it reads very quickly.  The plot is straightforward and well conceived.  Just enough twists are thrown at the reader to keep him or her engaged but it is, on the whole, uncomplicated.  Complete with tortured heroes, the novel does not break any new ground in the genre.  The writing, however, is very well done.  The narration is full of humor and provides the novel with a unique voice.	2002-04-18
US	52526368	RNZNWIK8YSH5N	0451203593	897342569	24 Hours	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Cliche But Worth Reading	Much of what I can say about 24 Hours can apply to many novels in the thriller/suspense genre - the characters are not well developed, the action is formulaic and the outcome is predictable.  Having said that, 24 Hours is reasonably well written and fast-paced enough to keep even seasoned suspense readers turning pages.<br />My main complaint with 24 Hours is that it could have reached the same conclusion in half the amount of pages.  As I said, the book was sufficiently fast-paced so length wasn't an issue, however, the plot was established early and there were very few revelations throughout the last half of the novel.  The content wasn't filler but it wasn't exactly essential to the plot.  In addition, the characters Joe and Huey seemed to be taken directly from Of Mice And Men.  Perhaps it was intentional.  Perhaps not.  It just made the action that much more predictable.<br />All-in-all, a good read.  Certainly not the best suspense novel I've read lately but definitely not the worst.	2002-04-15

A Canticle for Leibowitz deserves to be mentioned along with the greats - Foundation, Hyperion, Ender, Dune and Stranger In A Strange Land.  What many authors were able to accomplish across multiple volumes, Miller accomplishes in one intricate novel.  And while its `science fiction,' Miller's story is based on emotions, faith, belief...things that are of value not only in the world he creates but in ours as well.	2002-04-15
US	52526368	R2P5YT93RCIYOT	0679735771	92932803	American Psycho	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Graphic and Intense	I've read quite a few books and consider myself fairly well read.  Having read the majority of Ellis' novels, I figured I was well prepared to read American Psycho.  I was wrong.  American Psycho is the single most disturbing novel I have ever read.<br />The novel follows an unspecified period of time in the life of Patrick Bateman - all-knowing fashion consultant to the 20-something Manhattan scene, gourmand, young upwardly mobile professional on Wall Street, music critic, ladies man, talk show fanatic, recreational drug user, rapist and serial killer.  Ellis plunges readers into the life and mind of this Renaissance man and we're given a glimpse into something truly horrific.<br />American Psycho is not for the timid.  Both the sex and violence are extremely graphic, bordering, in parts, on the literary equivalent of a snuff film.  And although there is a strong desire to throw the book across the room and walk away from it at times, its utterly impossible to put down.	2002-04-09
US	52526368	R1YXMWNO6G61PT	0425098605	525781628	The Vision	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Decent, Simple Thriller	Mere days ago I slammed Mr. Koontz for his horrible novel Demon Seed.  From it one would (and probably should) get the sense that I was unwilling to give Koontz another chance.  But I'm forgiving and often a glutton for punishment so I picked up The Vision.  And I was not, for once, overly disappointed by Koontz.<br />The story itself is not unconventional or overly imaginative - a psychic who helps police capture serial killers gets caught up in a little danger and mystery of her own.  It is, however, well written and the characters are well developed and likable.  Despite the fact that Koontz tries to convince readers otherwise, it's pretty obvious who the \\"bad guy\\" is, the novel is no less thrilling.  <br />Its not excellent but its certainly better than some other novels by Koontz.	2002-04-01

Hurwitz seems to go out of his way to avoid using those elements that might distinguish The Tower.<br />With Jade Marlow, Hurwitz creates a hero who's difficult (at best) to like.  But at the same time we see his personal motivation, revealed through dreams and flashbacks, so his attitude is, for the most part, excusable.  Plus, he gets the job done.  But while the references to Jade's past help the reader understand what's driving him, they really don't add to the story and I was left wondering why they were included at all.  Unfortunately, Hurwitz doesn't take full advantage of either character in the novel that seems to be able to stand Marlow - his best friend or the FBI agent with whom he only briefly begins an affair (yet another unresolved element of the plot).<br />The tower itself is perhaps the most under-utilized creation in this novel.  It was an intriguing creation, although from a legal point of view I'd have a hard time seeing such a thing ever getting built - I think the whole `cruel and unusual' civil rights arguments would stop a project like this from getting any further than the drawing board but the tower and its residents were a relatively minor part of the entire novel.<br />The psychological and profiling aspects of the novel were interesting and displayed that Hurwitz had clearly done his research.  While The Tower had a lot going for it, it had little to differentiate it from every other thriller on the market.	2002-03-26

Banks), The Crow Road is an outstanding novel.  This time around, we find Banks taking on a family saga.  Amazingly Banks is able to pull off such a story.  He weaves a complex and intriguing family story and for extra bite, adds a little mystery to keep things interesting.<br />There's something haunting and magical in everything I've read by Banks and The Crow Road is no exception.  It's a shame it can't be found in the United States.  Hopefully Banks begins to receive the attention he deserves.	2002-03-26

Despite my love for High Fidelity, I honestly believe that About A Boy is a stronger, better book.<br />In his first three novels, Hornby focuses on relationships in various stages.  In High Fidelity, his focus was on dating and the fear of commitment while How To Be Good found Hornby exploring the end of a relationship (among other things).  About A Boy finds a single 30-something exploring a pseudo-parental relationship with 12-year-old Marcus.  The end-product is both emotionally satisfying and absolutely hilarious - especially the duck incident).<br />If you're not yet a Hornby fan, check out About A Boy.

US	52526368	R3PFBZWWWSPBGD	0425158594	545448747	Demon Seed	Books	1	4	7	N	N	What A Waste of Paper	Quite a long time ago I read a few Dean Koontz novels.  Then I promptly forgot about him and moved on to other things.  Recently, however, I've picked up a few of his novels.  And while most have been decent escapist fiction, they've reminded me why it was so easy to walk away from his novels to begin with - they're not bad but neither are they earth-shattering.  In a recent attempt to give Koontz another chance, I picked up Demon Seed (it was the first one I saw on the shelf).  I can't begin to describe how bad this novel is.<br />Let me say that the idea is good.  When Demon Seed was originally written, the idea hadn't been played to death.  At the time of conception, it was creative.  Or marginally creative - HAL had already gone nuts in 2001:  A Space Odyssey close to ten years before.  But as far as I know, few people had thought of the potential peril caused by the mechanisms that insulate our lives.  So that was an accomplishment.<br />The novel itself, however, was a horribly written, badly developed piece of trash.  If I didn't object to the concept of burning books, I'd have lit this one the minute I finished it.  There's virtually no suspense, readers have a pretty good idea how the story will play itself out by page five and the dialogue is just plain bad.<br />Don't get me wrong - I've read other novels by Koontz that I've really enjoyed.  This just isn't one of them.  Instead of reviving and updating Demon Seed, Koontz should have asked that it be mercifully destroyed by the publisher.	2002-03-25
US	52526368	R2MV3YU7KKQT97	0843947667	187446020	Mischief	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Below Average Horror	Despite being unimpressed by Halloween Man, I wanted to give Clegg another chance and checked out Mischief.  Unfortunately, it didnt really change my mind about Clegg whatsoever.<br />As I see it, there are three different types of horror/thriller writers:  there are the fairly literate and imaginative ones like Stephen King or Clive Barker.  Then there are the ones who write well, have good imaginations and clearly have fun with the genre  think Bentley Little or John Saul.  Then there are the hacks  the writers that just crank out endless reams of fiction and are neither decent writers nor imaginative.  From what Ive been able to see, Clegg falls somewhere in between the last two categories.<br />Clegg can write when he wants to.  His characterization is good.  The pacing of his stories is decent and his ideas are okay.  Mischief, however, was a typical horror story that could have been written by any author, anytime.  There was nothing about it that caused it to outshine any other examples of its genre that Ive read recently.	2002-03-25

Hard-Boiled Wonderland is no exception.<br />Unfolding through two separate narratives, Murakami deftly paints the pictures of two contrasting realities and the actions that inevitably tie them together.  It recalled Iain Bank's `The Bridge' and Irvine Welch's `Mirabou Stork Nightmares' - both novels that dealt with characters inhabiting multiple realities.  <br />Murakami pulls off something wonderful and magical here.  Not to be missed.	2002-03-21

Tell No One is one of the few exceptions to this rule.  Coben has accomplished two things with Tell No One:  he's created a good, solid, strong mystery and he's written a story with likable, well constructed characters with emotions that we can all identify with to a certain degree.  Despite the top-notch characterization, the action of the story never falters.  As promised, there are plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing.  While it's a relatively easy read, the story is clearly well thought out and engaging.  A fantastic, fun read.  Enjoy!	2002-03-21

While many suspense and mystery novels are formulaic and the language seems designed to appeal to the least common denominator, Howard defies tradition and creates a well written novel with fully developed characters.  Because of this, the novel moves more slowly than many typical suspense novels but the experience seems to run a little deeper than most as well.  The action is slow and the revelations are few and far between but this does not count against the novel as a whole.  If you're tired of formulaic suspense novels or mysteries, try Discovering the Body.  And if you're a fan of well written fiction, you'll like it as well.	2002-03-20

Its unfortunate that the book is poorly written.<br />Preston has a gift for explaining the complex concepts of bio-warfare, forensics and biology to the layman.  But Preston doesn't know when he's the voice of the narrator and when he's the teacher.  Throughout The Cobra Event, he interjects explanatory sentences and paragraphs.  While this helps the reader, it doesn't do much for the flow of the story.  It feels as if he's constantly shifting points of view and the book becomes inconsistent in parts.  However, as I mentioned, these explanations are needed and very helpful.  I only wish he had found another way to incorporate them without disrupting the flow of the story.<br />Preston doesn't manage to handle his characters well either.  There's not one character in the book that could be considered well developed.  That said, you don't typically expect perfect character development in a novel like this.  <br />Regardless of all the flaws, this is a very interesting novel.  Its not perfect but its worth reading.	2002-03-08

Unfortunately, I found the book somewhat disappointing.<br />The premise of Mothman Prophecies is interesting but the actual execution of the book doesn't live up to the promise of the subject matter.  Keel tries to include too much information and too many diverse happenings.  While everything in the book contributes to the premise - that strange things did indeed happen in West Virginia one year in the mid-sixties - he never really focuses on any one aspect.  Mothmen are one of many phenomena he describes.  And while he gives a great deal of background on the many phenomena, he never really lets us know what he thought caused the upheaval that year.  There are many case studies but very few conclusions as to the cases he encounters first-hand.  And when he does cite previous studies or encounters, his sources seem a little shaky.  Citing established sources is one thing but citing what I would think of as fringe publications causes me to question the validity of both his conclusions and the original source material.  I do, however, understand that legitimate, well done research is produced by less established organizations and publications.<br />While there are flaws, Keel does make the book enjoyable.  It could be dry and lifeless but he injects a good sense of humor into his study keeping the reader engaged.  And while you may believe nothing about what he claims happened, he does make a strong case for himself.  Its hard to avoid admitting that something outside our collective realms of experience happened that year.	2002-02-25

Preston and Child team up to deliver an action-packed, entertaining tale of lost treasure and greed.  Unlike many adventure novelists, Preston and Child create fully realized characters and intricate plot lines.

And it's a shame that I'm so persistent because I should have put this one down and started something else.  I've read some bad stuff and this ranks right up there.<br />Patrick McCabe is a talented author.  Both The Butcher Boy and Carn were excellent novels.  So I was confused when I got through the first few pages of Breakfast on Pluto.  Was it me?  Was this genius and was I failing to recognize truly brilliant writing?  I've figured out that the answer is no.  Breakfast on Pluto is just plain bad.  Unfortunately, its had the side effect of turning me off Patrick McCabe in general.

Wrack is a love story, a mystery and a history (although the author admits he did flub a few things) of the discovery of Australia.  On each of these levels, Bradley succeeds.  He's able to create characters readers can both relate to and care about and involve them in an irresistible archeological mystery.

While his first two novels have a definite setting and time period, Three To See The King does not. Instead the story revolves around a man living alone on a windswept plain in a house of tin. Alone until Mary Petrie arrives, that is. Through his introduction Mills explores male/female relationships and we see our unnamed narrator change his ways. As his friends begin picking up (literally, their tin houses and all) and moving away, the narrator begins to realize that he might be missing something. Indeed when he investigates the spot where his former neighbors have chosen to live, he finds them clustered together in a large community of tin houses. All following one man on his quest to accomplish the impossible.<br />This is a story that operates on a few different levels. Like his previous works, Mills plops a character in the middle of the setting without any explanation. But his first two novels were grounded in reality - realistic settings, action and characters (for the most part). <br />I agree with previous reviewers. When you pick this one up, suspend all perception of reality. Take it at face value and interpret from what you're given. It could be a fable, could be a religious metaphor, could be a comment on our dreams of a utopia that can never exist. Or it could just be a story about a guy who lives in a tin house in the middle of a windswept plain.	2002-02-21

He wasn't able to pull it off in Neighborhood Watch.  You'd get a better answer from Bentley Little, who was successful in The Association.  <br />Reading the synopsis on the back of the book, it sounds as though Neiderman used Little's idea for The Association verbatim.  Once you start reading, however, its clear that Neiderman isn't going to be able to pull it off nearly as well.  Neiderman's ideas, while suitably strange and creepy, lack real imagination.  He doesn't take many risks with the plot and while his characters are well developed, they're not altogether likable.<br />Having read two Neiderman novels, I also have to say that he doesn't use supernatural elements wisely.  They'd be all too appropriate in Neighborhood Watch but his explanation of events is quite banal and down-to-earth.  However in Amnesia, he introduced supernatural elements when his tale could be perfectly told with a realistic explanation.<br />Regardless, Neighborhood Watch is an entertaining read but it doesn't live up to its potential.  Instead, check out The Association.	2002-02-21

In search of the occasional light read, I picked up Neiderman's Amnesia not long ago.  I have to say that it was a far better reading experience than Neiderman's Neighborhood Watch.  The premise - commuter Aaron Clifford `wakes' in Grand Central Station with no clue who he is, where he's headed and why he's there - is simple but manages to play on irrational fears we all harbor.  While Mr. Clifford does eventually make it home and adjusts to his `new' wife, home, daughter and job, he senses that something just isn't right.  While he feels guilty for questioning it, there's something too perfect about his marriage, his daughter, the town of Driftwood and the people who populate it.<br />Amnesia is a satisfying, quick read.

I will say that, while this isn't literature in its finest form, The First Counsel is a top-notch thriller that I thought was very exciting to read.  It was only after I finished the novel that I realized how entangled I was.  Meltzer pulled off a good plot and great characterization.

The Revelation is unfocused and I thought falling back on ancient Indian spiritual lore was too easy for a writer living in Arizona and not at all worthy of Little's imagination (which is considerable).  As with other books, Little writes clean, readable prose, very easy to digest.

I read The House a few years ago but don't remember being overly impressed.  However, reading The Association recently changed my mind about Little and I became a believer.<br />The Store, like The Association, is a great deal of fun to read.  Little has a gift for making the reader uncomfortable and he uses this gift to great effect.  The plot - discount chain opens a store in small town Arizona and strange things begin to happen - is simple enough but very creepy.  Little capitalizes on reader's fears of the horrible taking place in everyday life, in everyday settings.<br />The Store is not as good as The Association (and if you're wondering why I keep making the comparison, read both and you'll find out) however The Store has a more satisfying ending.

Blood Crazy is one of them.<br />The premise is pretty simple - take The Stand, cross it with Lord Of The Flies and you pretty much get the idea.  What makes this work, however, are strong characters and an action-driven plot.  Clark develops well-rounded characters that readers can actually care about.  And while a lot of the action in the book is pretty disturbing, there's some definite emotion here.  Clark fuels his story with fast paced action and some very intense imagery that's very easy to get caught up in.<br />All-in-all, I find it hard to believe that Clark isn't a little better known outside of the horror genre.  He's obviously talented and deserves more recognition.	2002-02-20

It is not engrossing, rather it is slow moving with poorly developed characters and absolutely no action to drive what little plot there is.  The only shred of hope for this little novel is the language with which it is written.  DeLillo is clearly a fine author.  But there's not a great deal of proof to back it up here.	2002-02-20
US	52526368	R1C5XZREKSEGYF	0451205553	634041775	Trauma	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Only Lukewarm	Prior to reading Trauma, I'd never read anything by Masterson but I've been enjoying some lighter fiction, specifically horror, to offset a heavy workload and a long winter.  Trauma seemed like it would be a good read and I was curious about Masterson, as he seems to have a good reputation.  Unfortunately, Trauma doesn't live up to expectations.  Masterson is able to setup a decent story with reasonably well dreamed up characters however the entire novella seems like a setup for a larger story that never really happens.  I found myself waiting for the story to kick in but it never really gained speed.  The ending?  Marginally predictable.  Having said that, it is a quick read and it is moderately entertaining.	2002-02-20
US	52526368	RDJHOMQ1FE6QC	0684865114	239727018	The Restraint of Beasts	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Darkly Comic Debut	Magnus Mills, bus driver and first time novelist, has created a darkly humorous portrait of blue-collar work in Britain with Restraint of Beasts.  I can't share much wisdom that previous reviews haven't already imparted although I do have to agree with some who have said they didn't find this as hilarious as they were led to believe.  I found it darkly amusing but not laugh out loud funny.  What impressed me most about the novelist and his story was the fact that he took events to an extreme - not content to let his characters deal with one bad situation, Mills makes it worse.  An appropriate subtitle for Restraint of Beasts could easily be \\"when bad things happen to bad people...and get worse all the time.\\"  Yet he's constructed his characters in such a way that you do feel for them.<br />While the end is somewhat unsatisfying, Restraint of Beasts is an excellent first novel.  Mills' All Quiet on the Orient Express is also recommended.	2001-10-29

If you've read any of Jeff Noon's other novels, you know that he's maniacally brilliant and quite off-the-wall.  Automated Alice doesn't do anything to dissuade readers of that notion.<br />Noon tries, rather successfully in my opinion, to write a third Alice story...one in which she finds herself in present day Manchester, England after climbing through a grandfather clock.  Noon uses Carroll's fine use of language and wordplay to create this very entertaining story which does fit into the Manchester he created with Pollen and Vurt.  <br />This is a story written as only Noon could write it.  Some will say it's a rip-off and a poor imitation of Carroll but I think it's a great tribute and a fun read.	2001-10-29

I can say that this is a very funny and memorable read.  Rarely do I laugh out loud at things I read but this one had me roaring.  Especially \\"You Can't Kill The Rooster\\" - hilarious stuff.  I'm withholding one star because the collection seems a bit uneven.  It starts out strong but levels out towards the middle, eventually picking up some steam towards the end.  The pieces become less slapstick and more speculative, concentrating on life abroad in the last section of the book.  That's not a bad thing - it just makes the collection seem uneven.<br />Everyone needs a good laugh, especially now.  Read this.  Soon.	2001-10-29
US	52526368	R2J7DQDB6QYD7V	0375724508	79158641	Ghostwritten	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Threads of a Novel	I must echo most previous reviewers' sentiments about Ghostwritten.  It is well written - of that there can be absolutely no doubt.  Each of the nine stories is unique.  It's difficult to imagine that these nine pieces could come out of the same mind.  The characters are well developed (as well developed as they could be from first-person narratives) and the settings convincing.  <br />What doesn't work here is the idea that this is a novel comprised of nine interlinked stories.  It just doesn't satisfy the way a novel should.  When I picked it up, I was prepared to be confused, trying to put all the pieces together but I did expect them to all fall into place in the end.  And while some ideas did come together, the majority didn't.<br />So, why the four stars?  As I said, each piece was well written and intriguing.  Plus there's a certain amount of mystery that compelled me to keep reading.  That sense that the reader was a part of the mystery Mitchell was setting up.  That it didn't pan out the way I'd have liked it to didn't really disappoint me because it was so well done.  <br />My suggestion - look at this as a collection of individual works of fiction tied together by loose threads.  If you like more cohesive \\"tales of coincidence\\" try Geoff Nicholson's Bleeding London or Richard Beard's Damascus.	2001-10-25

Give the reader the real story behind the Hook Man, the one-armed man who plagues parking hot spots.  And while the reader did get some of this, what they really received was a half-developed quirky character that I personally didn't really care too much about.<br />Clark could have developed an intriguing character in Leonard Gage but all he was able to really do with the character was give the reader a neurotic and slightly pathetic character.  While the narrative leapt between past and present showing the development of the Hook Man, too much was left out.  By the time I was finished, I didn't feel as though I had received an accurate, complete portrait of the character.  I don't believe that Clark ever decided on what he really wanted to do with Hook Man Speaks.  He straddled the line between a funny and quirky story based on urban legend and biography of troubled childhood.  Not that these two things are mutually exclusive but it did seem he had trouble defining the tone of Hook Man Speaks.<br />All-in-all, Hook Man Speaks was a unique experience and not at all an unpleasant read.  It's worth reading despite the flaws.  Unfortunately, it would be Clark's first and only novel.	2001-10-18

McDevitt never really tells the reader what happened - the events are only referred to as the \\"plague\\" and specifics aren't mentioned.  Fortunately for the readers, the main characters decide to search for the mysterious \\"Haven\\" where, during the plague, the vestiges of society were supposedly rounded up and saved for all eternity.  <br />To me, this concept was irresistible.  McDevitt not only delivers on wonderful and innovative ideas but also creates very real, fully developed characters.  While reading, I couldn't help think of similarities between the movie Logan's Run and A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter Miller. Eternity Road is a wonderfully entertaining novel well worth the time and money.	2001-10-17

Seven travelers all find themselves on the same journey and each tell the story that brought them to that point.  And thus Simmons creates an incredible universe through the eyes of seven unique and well-crafted characters.  <br />Hyperion ranks with great science fiction creations of all time, from Asimov's Foundation to Heinlein's Lazarus Long or Herbert's Dune.  The fiction is both character and idea driven.  Simmons' storytelling abilities are also excellent - the tales he writes range from brutal and violent to beautiful and poignant.  <br />As previous reviewers have noted, please have Fall of Hyperion ready to go.  It picks up where this one leaves off and you'll want to have it handy.  The other two books in the series are also definitely worth reading.  Too bad Simmons moved on to other genres of fiction.  One can only hope he'll revisit the universe he created here.	2001-10-17

It sounded quirky and fun and I hadn't read anything by the author despite the fact that I have seen his work in quite a few bookstores. I am very glad that I picked it up - this was a very honest look at American life at the turn of the millennium. Lives seen through the naive eyes of an outsider. Well concieved and written. And while lives and cultures are being examined, the author makes no value judgements; he leaves it to the reader to interpret. <br />Bottom line: great read.	2001-10-02

And my first foray into his universe was The Stone Canal.<br />While The Stone Canal is a relatively short book, it's absolutely packed with ideas and is not a light read by any stretch of the imagination.  The plot follows two distinct time-lines giving readers a history of the events that happen in the more distant future portion of the book.  While the basis of all conflict in the novel (and the others in this `universe') is the practice of communism, the arguments and diatribes by the characters and some of the events themselves seem tedious.  It is idea-driven science fiction but the over-explanation of these ideas slows the action of the book down making it tedious in places.<br />I have the rest of the books in this series and I'm eager to read them.  However I do hope that MacLeod allows the overriding political concepts behind his novels to remain in the background and let his other very creative and brilliant ideas shine in future works.  So I give The Stone Canal five stars for creativity, some great characters and wonderful world-building but three for the uneven pacing of the book.  Hence the four stars.	2001-10-01

All are appropriate and easily applicable to Walking on Glass.<br />As previous reviewers have mentioned, the construction of the book is odd  each chapter is divided into three parts, each following a different story line.  Each is very intriguing on its own and, until the end, these lines seemingly have little to do with each other.  While it can be maddening trying to find a common thread and hard not to just skip ahead to figure it all out, the scenes that Banks sets up are irresistible.<br />Its difficult not to like this book, or at the very least be intrigued.  Unfortunately its difficult to find in the United States but easy to order from the Amazon UK site.  And well worth the extra shipping costs.	2001-10-01

Feeding off the drum and bass culture in London combined with urban myth, King Rat is a very hip but very dark book.  Despite liking books very similar to it, I did find it somewhat hard to get into but once I did get fully immersed in the plot, it was hard to put down.  Great action, incredible use of language, and an interesting explanation of an age-old myth.  For fans of urban fantasy, this one's a must.	2001-10-01

Actors singing, singers acting, actors writing.  And very few of these efforts are ever very successful.  However, Ethan Hawke might be on to something here.<br />The Hottest State finds a character based, we may assume, on Hawke himself.  Newly arrived in New York seeking acting jobs, he meets a girl, falls madly in love, and suffers the ups and downs of the relationship.  The story itself is fairly predictable, the outcome never in much doubt.  But what's striking about the novel is that, even though you know whats going to happen, you feel as though you have an emotional stake in it.  <br />Hawke's skills need work and refinement but he's definitely got talent.  He's able to engage readers, lure them into a story despite its predictability.  I certainly hope he continues his literary endeavors.	2001-09-21

Like any collection of fiction by multiple authors, there are some duds but all-in-all this is a satisfying read.<br />Especially brilliant are the pieces by Nick Hornby, John O'Farrell, Melissa Bank and Zadie Smith. But the stand-out performance really comes from Roddy Doyle. Irvine Welsh's entry is excellent but its harshness is a little out of keeping with the rest of the stories (but typical for Welsh). Another pleasant surprise is the piece by Colin Firth - actor seen in Bridget Jones' Diary and Fever Pitch.<br />As I said, there are a few duds. I didn't think Helen Fielding's piece was very well done at all - it seemed more like rambling than short fiction. Dave Eggers' piece was also a disappointment. I truly loved his Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius but the piece he contributed here seems like he knocked it out in an hour and gave very little thought to it. In that respect, it seemed out of place here.<br />Proceeds from the collection benefit educational programs for autistic children both in the U.S. and Great Britian so even if you're not a fan of all the contributors, it's a worthy cause.	2001-09-21

With The Foreigner, Meg Castalado has written a fast-paced, intriguing novel full of interesting characters and plot twists.  The Foreigner is plainly written with little or no traces of a unique writing style on the part of Castalado.  Where she shines is in the ability to construct an even, exciting page-turner.  It's exciting and entertaining, plain and simple.  Nothing more.  But sometimes all you need is a cheap literary thrill ride like this.	2001-09-21

I remember reading something horrid by him many years ago and deciding that he was just a hack writer and not worth my time.  But recently I found myself curious about Kings appeal so I picked up The Long Walk, not one of his more mainstream titles.  And Im impressed.<br />Within the first few pages, King manages to setup an entirely surreal situation and he does this with little explanation up front.  Instead, he feeds readers small pieces of information throughout the main body of the story.  Of course, he kept the answers to many questions from the reader  when this story takes place, what drove society into such a state, etc.  But perhaps that makes the story that much more interesting and riveting.<br />Bottom line:  Ill go for any novel that really proves to be a mind-trip and this is one of them.  This is a fabulous novel and has truly changed my opinion of Kings talent.<br />Other great mind-trips:  A Hard-Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World by Haruki Murakami, The Bridge by Iain Banks and Marabou Stork Nightmares by Irvine Welsh.	2001-08-16

Each successive novel has become a bit more serious in tone yet no less entertaining.<br />How To Be Good follows Katie Carr through the emotional ups and downs of a failing marriage and her quest to be \\"good\\". Yet she has a bit of competition when it comes to be good because of her husband's sudden shift in attitude. What ensues is a very well rendered and quite humorous look at relationships, why we stay in them and how fragile they are.<br />How To Be Good is definitely not as funny as Hornby's past novels but it seems more heartfelt than his previous efforts. The trade-off is a positive one. So read How To Be Good and enjoy.	2001-07-20

Like another recent read of mine, The Sleep-Over Artist by Thomas Beller, it's hard to tell if Kissing is comprised of chapters or interlocking short stories.   Beller might have been slightly more successful at writing a cohesive piece of fiction but only because he was a bit more reserved with the format - his stories all followed a very structured time-line, following the main character from a very early age through his thirties.  Schickler doesn't really keep to any kind of time-line so the reader has no real frame of reference.  A few of the \\"stories\\" are one-offs - aside from a few characters that crop up in other portions of the book, the action has little to do with other parts of the book.  But what makes this unique is that most of the loose ends somehow end up getting cleaned up and the whole thing ends of making sense.  <br />As for the writing, it's obvious very early on that Schickler is a gifted writer.  The various plot-lines are imaginative and well thought out as are his characterizations.<br />All-in-all, well worth a read.	2001-07-18

And, all-in-all, I have a very positive impression of We after reading it.  But I was let down in a couple of ways.<br />First, I found the book difficult to read due to the pace of the book.  I believe that this was largely due to the fact that I wasn't expecting something with quite as much of an introspective slant to it.  Perhaps had I begun the book knowing that, I might have been more receptive to what it had to offer.  We often takes a very sharp introspective turn during which the narrator examines his mortality, his desires and the world as he knows it.<br />Second, the action of the book seems to occur in fits and spurts.  And perhaps the book is too short to describe the action that takes place and is so essential to both the plot of the book and understanding of the characters.  The reader is also not presented with a great deal of background and I, for one, was very curious how this 26th century Earth came to be.<br />On the whole, We deserves a great deal of credit.  It was the precursor to Brave New World and 1984 and clearly paved the way for new forms of speculative fiction.  Considering the time and country in which it was written, its clearly a bold book.  But unfortunately some of its flaws overshadow its importance, though only slightly.	2001-06-20

It's got the perfect combination of a UNIT adventure and the &quot;strange goings on in small town England&quot; story line going for it.  The characters are well rendered and the whole thing is just fun.<br />While I doubt that any Dr. Who novel would win the Booker or the Noble Prize for Literature, they are a fun break from the &quot;hard stuff&quot; - read and enjoy.	2001-06-12

I loved the show growing up and found out a few years ago that, while times have definitely changed, I still do.  And the books are great fun.  Normally...<br />Unfortunately Mick Lewis chose to use an insane amount of violence and gore in Rags.  Not that I object to that kind of thing as long as its appropriate to the story.  But in this case it wasn't.  I'm used to a Dr. Who with cheesy monsters, maybe a few chills and surprises and certainly, bad things do happen.  A few of the Dr. Who books have been quite graphic but this takes the cake.  <br />What bothers me most is that the author did this to the Third Doctor and Jo - my favorite combination.  If you don't have to read this one, don't.  If you absolutely must, don't say no one warned you of possible dissappointment.	2001-06-12

If you were to read the synopsis on the back of The Sleep-Over Artist, you'd be incorrectly led to believe that this is a novel or at least a book containing a somewhat normal flow of events and plot.  However, Beller has constructed a \\"fiction\\" of short stories linked only by their main character and his romantic experiences.<br />The fact that the blurb on the back of the book was misleading does not mean that this is a disappointing book.  In fact, from a writing perspective, its very interesting the way in which Beller constructed The Sleep-Over Artist, following one character and revealing snapshots of his life to the reader.  But this structure is also maddening at times.  While the stories follow a standard time-line, tracing the main character from youth to his late 20's, almost all of these stories go unresolved.  And following stories merely give slight insight into any resolution that has occurred.  In fact, some characters are re-introduced as though the reader has not yet met the characters.<br />All these things combined, I'm not sure I understand Beller's intent.  Did he originally start off writing short stories involving a central character and then decide to throw them into one volume?  Are these autobiographical stores in which he changed the names and arranged them into this collection?  Or did he begin with the intention of taking snapshots of the life of his main character and lose his way somewhere along the line?  It's not clear.  The Sleep-Over Artist is worth reading for its humor and insight into the frailty of relationships but the flaws of the structure of this fiction often overshadow the actual prose.	2001-06-12

However in this case, the father doesn't just give up.  He is forced to rise to the occasion of fatherhood and deal with all the consequences this holds.<br />It's easy to assume that this story would fall into one of two categories - it could become either a \\"Mr. Mom\\" story or one in which the normal roles of post-divorce parenthood play themselves out.  Luckily, Parsons does not follow either of these to avenues, instead choosing a more difficult but rewarding path for his characters.   And he handles all this with a great deal of humor and wit, writing a very funny, often heartbreaking story about the trials and tribulations of raising a child alone.  I laughed, I cried...no, really!<br />All said, Parsons never really takes the easy way out, never falls into the trap of conventional outcomes and stereotypes.  In the end, the reader is left with an emotionally gratifying story.  Strongly recommended if you're a fan of Nick Hornby's About A Boy.	2001-05-29

What I got met both of those criteria and so much more.<br />Observatory Mansions, as previous reviewers have summarized, revolves around the life of Francis Orme and his ancestral home, Observatory Mansions.  Throughout his 37 years, Francis has seen Observatory Mansions lose its grandeur, change its name and be divided into flats.  And the inhabitants of those flats are as unique as the history of the building and Francis himself.  While the population of Observatory Mansions has stayed static for many years, Anna Tap moves in and upsets the balance.<br />Through first-person narrative, a \\"history\\" of Observatory Mansions written by Francis, flashbacks and insightful characterization, Carey writes a memorably story that proves difficult to forget.  Although, it's so remarkable, you're unlikely to want to.<br />Edward Carey is truly a novelist with talent.  His experience as a playwright has helped him take a unique approach to novel writing.  Let's hope he continues his career as a novelist.	2001-05-22

Throughout his work, Markson runs through details about how famous literary figures have died, what philosophers believed and what artists said.  There are no characters except, perhaps, for the elusive \\"Writer\\".  There is no plot.  Nothing thrilling happens.  And yet its amazing to me how drawn in to the book I was.<br />Bottom line:  I don't know what it was but I'm glad I read it.  Experimental fiction can either be disastrous (see The Castle of Crossed Destinies by Italo Calvino) or monumentally successful (see 253: The Print Remix by Geoff Ryman) - there's usually no middle ground.  This Is Not A Novel definitely fits into the latter category.	2001-05-22

I'm torn between two assumptions - either Rachel Cusk writes beautifully and intends on challenging readers or she's pompous and likes using big words to show how good a writer she thinks she is. My guess is that the truth lies somewhere in between.<br />The premise of Saving Agnes is wonderful - professional woman working in London trying to find herself. It's not a very original premise but its one that's worked for many other authors. The very first paragraph of the book draws you in and is hard not to like. But aside from the decent premise and that first paragraph, Saving Agnes doesn't have much going for it. What little happens in the book and what resolution there is can be gleaned just as easily from the blurb on the back of the book without having to wade through 200 pages.<br />That said, Saving Agnes is an interesting read. Perhaps I'm better off for reading it as it makes me appreciate good solid writing even more. Cusk has potential but needs to shy away from her intense and overly indulgent writing style.	2001-05-15

The Business is his latest contribution to the \\"regular\\" fiction genre.  And Banks does not disappoint.<br />The Business follows the life of a woman who works for \\"the business,\\" an age-old company shrouded in mystery.  Without revealing plot or storylines, let me just assure that Banks continues to do all the things he does so well - excellent character development, mystery and intrigue, excellent storytelling and settings and an overriding sense of morality that seems to guide most of the characters in his novels.  Again Banks proves why he deserves such respect as an insightful and innovative author.<br />Frankly the only reason why I can't give The Business five stars is that, compared to some of his other works such as The Bridge and The Player of Games, The Business, while excellent, does not quite measure up to his potential.  But almost any effort by Banks is worth reading.	2001-05-15

And again, he's done an impressive job.<br />Asimov's original robot novels were generally straightforward.  While not predictable by any stretch of the imagination, the mysteries themselves were fairly simple.  Tiedemann has taken Asimov's \\"universe\\" but made the mysteries more complex and expanded the scope of the setting to fully explain political situations, alliances, development of society in settler and spacer worlds...many of the things Asimov himself never fully developed.  This all amounts to a fairly complex mystery novel set in Asimov's vision of the future.<br />The novel is not without problems.  One criticism I had of Tiedemann's first novel still holds true - two of the main characters have an extensive past together yet Tiedemann makes no mention of this fact.  Some of the ideas in Chimera also come across as a bit far-fetched in the context of the setting that Asimov established.<br />All-in-all, Chimera is an entertaining read.  If you're a fan of Asimov's original robot novels, its definitely worth picking up.  If you've not had exposure to the originals, however, start with them.	2001-05-01

Call me cheap but it seemed like a lot to ask of me to shell out $20 for a 130-page book.  But when the paperback came out, I immediately picked it up.  And I'm pleased that I did.<br />When reading The Name of the World, one honestly gets the sense that Johnson takes great care crafting each sentence.  Each one is loaded with meaning.  Johnson's got a great gift for understated humor as well.<br />The only flaw I saw is that the story goes nowhere.  Johnson brings the reader up to speed on events that transpire after the bulk of the story but he takes care of that long before the last page.  The reader is then left with a story that just ends with little resolution.  All-in-all, I would highly recommend The Name of the World and am planning on picking up something else by Mr. Johnson in the near future.	2001-04-30

Now, I've never been a fan of Gatsby nor will I ever become one, however Macy has weaved a story of such depth and breadth that one cannot help becoming intimately involved in the characters and their lives - lives of money, posh private clubs, boarding schools and Ivy League colleges.<br />I think what strikes me as unbelievable is that this story is written by a woman.  Ms. Macy is so astonishing a writer that she can have readers truly believe in the male narrator.  All characters are very well developed and multifaceted, retaining both enviable and less-than-admirable qualities.  <br />I had this sitting on my \\"to read\\" shelf for quite a while but now I'm pained that I waited this long to read it.

From the talent he has displayed from the beginning of his career, it should come as no surprise that Steve Martin is able to write a good novella.  And yet for some reason Shopgirl is surprising.  Maybe it's the subject matter - you'd expect something funny from Steve Martin, and this isn't all that light-hearted.  Martin deals with some basic human emotions and is able to realistically portray the life of his protagonist.<br />My reason for the missing star?  Martin's scope seems to constantly change.  He often throws the reader a few pitches that end up going wild.  There are references to characters and events that deserve more detail and resolution but never get them.  Because he's new to the genre, this can be understood but a good editor should have been able to sense these elements and change them.<br />Overall, this is a really entertaining read and shows depth and talent thus far untapped from a truly talented indvidual.	2001-03-08

Being an English major, I'm not quite sure how that happened but nevertheless it did.  So, whilst in the bookstore recently, I had to pick up a copy. I had prepared myself for a boring read but I was pleasantly surprised to find a very good challenging story.  <br />The first thing that really jumped out at me was Camus' writing style.  It took time to develop a knack for reading the short, abrupt sentences.  The feeling was akin to sitting in traffic - from 50 miles and hour to a full stop repeated over and over again.  But I warmed to the style of writing and soaked in the language, the story and the setting.<br />I now understand why this is considered by many to be a cornerstone of European literature.  And I highly recommend reading it.  Its not as daunting as the literary world leads you to believe.	2001-02-26

I was so enthusiastic about The Stranger and Camus in general that I went out and picked up The Fall.  As it turns out, I was a little too enthusiastic.<br />This was a very difficult book to get through for me - and I read just about everything out there.  This is basically one side of a conversation in which the protagonist explains himself and his past to a stranger.  The one redeemable thing about The Fall is that there is a certain striking and scary truth in the protagonist.  I believe we can all see parts of ourselves in the character and the character is not very appealing.  But there are certain truths revealed by The Fall that are universal.  <br />While we can all gain some insight into ourselves, this is not an enjoyable read.  Frankly, it was a struggle.  Sometimes these literary struggles have a big payoff.  This, however, did not.  Consider it a 150 page character study.  While very well executed, it lacked substance.	2001-02-26

This was my first exposure to Carroll's writing and it definitely won't be the last.  I think what Carroll does so well is blend everyday life with the absurd and perhaps bring out some of the magic we'd all like to see in our everyday lives.  That's not to say that we'd actually like everything that happens in The Wooden Sea to come true...just the possibility that it could, perhaps.  <br />I've read quite a few reviews of Carroll's works and many have been reluctant to compare him to other authors or are simply unable to.  Three authors that spring to mind, however, are Charles DeLint, Iain Banks, and Nicholas Christopher.<br />Read and enjoy.  This is a treasure.	2001-02-26

He claims that this is his first thriller but I think its easy to argue that most of his previous works have had equal amounts of \\"thrill\\" to them.  What Joyce does so well is quickly set up an intriguing situation with captivating characters.  He accomplishes in one chapter what most authors would do in several.<br />While the ending seems a little rushed and lacks some of the resolution I would have liked to see, the book is entertaining.  Its easy to see why he's earned the respect of the British writing community and been able to nab so many awards.  I'd be more apt to recommend Dreamside or Tooth Fairy before Indigo but this is a satisfying read.	2001-02-21

But an Excellent Addition To The Ender Universe	I was apprehensive when I heard another Ender book was hitting the shelves, having enjoyed all of the original series as well as Ender's Shadow - I didn't want anything to ruin the previous books.  But I needn't have worried.<br />Orson Scott Card has done a remarkable job filling in gaps in his original story line.   For those who were curious what was happening on Earth while Ender was settling a new colony in Speaker for the Dead, this book will be very enlightening.  Card does an excellent job describing the events that take place following Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Some of the true strength in the novel is that it plays on the same themes (leadership, morality, spirit and determination) that made Ender's Game such a strong and powerful novel.  And the good news is that Card states in the afterward that there's more to come.  Until then, enjoy Shadow of the Hegemon.	2001-01-03

So, I picked it up and promptly finished it and it left me somewhat disappointed.  The story was just way too easy.<br />I'll agree with previous reviewers who have stated that this is like a Jules Verne novel only worse.  Verne could at least invent some likable, well developed characters.  Carr seems to gloss over most characterization in favor of a quick read. <br />While I wasn't impressed with the book on the whole, I did enjoy Carr's ideas of the future especially coming from one who so frequently studies the past.  I would have expected and enjoyed a more complex story however.  <br />The verdict:  Wait for the paperback.	2000-12-29

Actually, I've always found the idea a little silly.  But I've enjoyed Dr. Who for years and having run out of the BBC-released video tapes, I decided to try out a book just for a laugh.  Surprisingly, each one I've read has been very well written and very entertaining.  Grave Matter is no different.<br />While this particular incarnation of the Doctor is not my favorite, I must admit I found him appealing in this story.  The plot was a mixture of horror, suspense and science-fiction written with a decidedly British and Dr. Who-esque twist.  This is not serious literature but it is well written and, like most Dr. Who books, defies the stereotypes that normally plague books based on TV shows.  The only problem with reading these books is that its easy to regret that the show is no longer being produced - so many of these stories would make excellent shows.	2000-12-19

I've never been a huge Steinbeck follower - I've read a few of his works but I'm probably not as well-versed as I should be.  That, however, will change after having recently read Once There Was A War.  <br />This compilation of reports from England, North Africa and Italy in 1943 provides excellent descriptions of what life was really like during the war.  There are very few recounts of battles and strategy.  But there are stories of the people that were involved in the war - the souls behind the uniforms.  Steinbeck does an excellent job showing that the war wasn't just made up of nameless soldiers - it was made up of people, each with personalities, each scared, each struggling to deal with life in such hostile conditions. <br />Aside from the historical value, these posts are amazingly well written.  I have to admit I was reasonably surprised by the quality of writing.  Steinbeck is an accomplished author, and on that I think everyone can agree, but to be able to put pieces like this together in London during the Blitz, in the deserts of North Africa or on a troop ship heading into the European theater is amazing to me.<br />Bottom line:  I've got a new respect for John Steinbeck and an added appreciation and understanding of WWII.  For both of those, I am grateful for having read this book.	2000-12-18

However, the story he writes is a compelling one.  While these topics - what happens to an alien race when humans want their planet for something else, the desire for other sources of resources, man's incredibly strong penchant for killing themselves - have all been dealt with in countless science fiction books and television shows, Blish eloquently deals with these subjects using four unique characters and four unique points of view.  Possibly falling into the category of a modern parable, A Case of Conscience remains an interesting and provocative novel.<br />It's a light book but fulfilling and a genuinely good read.	2000-12-18

When I finally got around to reading it, I was both captivated and repulsed.<br />The House Of Leaves is a complicated book.  My compliments to the author for managing to arrange it in such a fashion.  But this works both for and against the book.  The basic premise the author came up with is a fascinating one - a house that is larger on the inside than it is on the outside (a kind of residential TARDIS).  And if the author had just stuck to that element of the plot, I believe it would have been a much more rewarding read.  Instead he frames this story inside another...and perhaps another depending on how you read it.  The author augments the basic story line with the story of the life of Johnny Truant and  how he came to intercept the manuscript that describes the dimensionally-challenged house.<br />There were too many instances in which I became bored by the recounting of Johnny and his troubled life.  And too many times in which I began to think that the author was attempting to keep too many balls in the air at the same time.  Most of all, I was so intrigued with the portion of the plot about the house and its investigation, I became even more disinterested in those parts that seemingly had no connection.<br />All-in-all, Danielewski did an admirable job putting this book together.  The way in which it was arranged is truly unique.  The layout aides in conveying the horror and confusion of the events of the novel.  However, I can't help but think there was a little too much reliance on technique and not enough on good story telling.  I do, however, look forward to his next work.  I'm sure it will be something completely original and compelling.	2000-12-18

They were  generally quite negative and I was surprised due to both my positive  experience with Auster's work and the praise it usually received.  So I  held out, waited for the paperback and even that sat on my &quot;to  read&quot; pile for a while.  <br />The major lesson learned here:  don't let  other reviews make up your mind for you.  I am very pleased that I finally  picked Timbuktu up and read it.  It is a fine book, well written in a style  that is almost conversational.  The characters are rich (or as rich as they  can be in a 180 page novel) and telling the story from the point of view of  Mr. Bones was a fantastic idea.<br />This might not go down as Auster's best,  but its certainly worth the time and is a valuable addition to the Auster  bibliography.	2000-09-18

I must admit that I accidentally picked this one up without reading the second, Terraplane, so I can only compare it to the first of the series,  Ambient.<br />Heathern sees Womack showing a bit of restraint.  While his  story is brutal in its own right, its much more tame compared with Ambient  (or Random Acts of Senseless Violence which might be seen as the  predecessor to Ambient).  Because of his focus on the story, the reader is  left guessing about certain developments in this futuristic New York City.  <br />All in all, a good story but its not as strong as the beginning of the  series.	2000-06-27

My conclusion: I'm most impressed with Canin's work.  <br />The tale of two college friends, one acquainted to a posh New York City lifestyle, the other from the heartland - not a new concept but one that  deserved revisiting.  I have noticed many comparisons to The Great Gatsby  and I have to agree that there are some similarities (although I disliked  the Great Gatsby and enjoyed For Kings and Planets).  This is a wonderful  story, written with great care.  If I have any criticism of the novel, its  that the post-college portion of the novel seeemed slightly rushed, not  nearly as detailed or heartfelt as the first half of the novel.  However,  this is good writing!	2000-04-24

It seems to be generally agreed upon that this is not one of Iain Banks' finest works.  In Song of Stone, Banks has plucked some successful elements from previous works and placed them in a new novel.  It's not, however, a retread of ideas but some of the imagery might be familiar to Banks fans.   Normally, Banks could make something like this work, however the story that  he developed in A Song of Stone is not all that gripping.<br />That being  said, this is still a piece of Banks' fiction.  I don't blindly praise  favorite authors' works but there is something inherent in Banks' fiction  that exists here as well.  Banks is wonderful at making the reader  uncomfortable. If for nothing else, this book is a perfect example of  Banks' darkness and the quiet horror he can cause readers - something he  has in common with J.G. Ballard.<br />My advice - read all the Banks stuff you  can get your hands on.  Some are better than others but all are worth a  read.	2000-04-24

It's actually all of the above deftly written by Christopher.  I don't think any description would do this work justice - it's fun, very  well written, and exemplifies what a creative writer with a broad  imagination can do.  Check it out and enjoy!	2000-04-24

The Asimov universe has been respectfully added to since his untimely death - first there were the Robot City novels, then came the new Robot novels by Allen and then the Second Foundation Trilogy.  And now this, a new Robot novel.  In truth, while there have been some dissappointments,  most of the new novels set in Asimov's universe have been fairly good.  As  is this offering.<br />In Mirage, the author does a very good job capturing  the sense of mystery Asimov used in his own novels.  He also shows a good  grasp of Asimov's ideas and universe.<br />What is surprising to me is the  fact that no history is mentioned about the main characters who spent 6  novels together in the Robot City chronicles.  Nor is any indication given  as to when this story fits into the Asimov timeline - while the reader can  certainly guess, the author could have thrown the reader some sort of  lifeline from the original Asimov books to let us know what else was going  on.<br />At any rate, its an interesting read.  Very nice to see that the  spirit of Asimov is well remembered and appreciated.	2000-04-24

Its a universe created by Banks but you don't necessarily have to read all the books in the series - these books stand quite well on their own.  You won't be lost if you decide to plunge into The Player of  Games.<br />Simply put, this is a masterful piece of literature.  Banks is  often quoted as saying that this is the novel he had the most fun writing  and you can see why.  Part space opera, mystery and morality play, the  Player of Games is a satisfying read and one of my favorite works of  science fiction.<br />Do yourselves a favor and pick this one up.  Banks is a  true talent, unfortunately not one well recognized on this side of the  Atlantic.	2000-04-24

And its not because this is the finest piece of literature I have ever read.  It's just a very good, very funny book with a great deal of heart.<br />Scepticism, Inc. is a  look at the ways in which religion makes people act and manifests itself in  society.  Through farcical extremes, Fowler puts religion and human nature  under a microscope.  And its funny...and true.<br />It's very hard to review  something like this without giving away the magic.  It's not for everyone -  those with strict religious beliefs might not appreciate the fun Fowler  pokes, but for those with open minds (or even those with closed minds with  good senses of humor), Scepticism Inc is worth the read.	2000-04-10

I really thought that was an excellent piece of work.  So, I was in the mood for another horror yarn and I picked this up.   And I was dissappointed!<br />It seems like Saul knocked this one out as  quickly as possible just to have a presence on the bookshelves - its plot  was cliche and its ending very predictable.  Characters were tragically  underdeveloped and certain elements of the story that appeared as if they  were intended to be important, went nowhere.<br />All-in-all, not the best  thing I've read this month.  Not awful but bordering on a waste of time.	2000-04-10

That said, I'm wondering if preceeding reviewers have read this book  and judged it on its own merits.  From the sound of it, the author would  have been better off to have just written in the name &quot;Harvey&quot;  instead of &quot;PJ&quot; and &quot;Kate&quot; instead of  &quot;Ruth.&quot;<br />The book isn't horrible but its no literary classic  either.  It reads more like an expanded screenplay (which seems to be what  it is) than a novel.  The plot is interesting and the characterization  good.  But, having had a great amount of experience with dialogue because  of their careers in movies, I'm surprised at the quality of dialog in this  novel.  Frankly, its not great.  Ruth's speech is dotted with &quot;blah,  blah's&quot; as if the authors just got tired of putting words into her  mouth.  And PJ uses phrases unique to Australians (and most British) but  usually unheard in the United States.  It doesn't seem like much of an  effort was made to have PJ &quot;sound&quot; American.<br />Like I said, its  not a bad book.  Its close relationship to the movie can't be ignored but  it deserves to be evaluated on its own.  This is not great  literature...there's a lot better stuff out there to read than Holy Smoke!  but its entertainment.	2000-02-08

It sounded quirky and fun and I hadn't read anything by the author despite the fact that I have seen his work in quite a few bookstores.  I am very glad that I  picked it up - this was a very honest look at American life at the turn of  the millennium.  Lives seen through the naive eyes of an outsider.  Well  concieved and written.  And while lives and cultures are being examined,  the author makes no value judgements; he leaves it to the reader to  interpret.  <br />Bottom line: great read.  I wish there was a 4 and a half  star rating...I'm stingy with my 5's but this one is almost there.	2000-01-17
US	52526368	RNOPZE8NQKRRU	0393316165	848922126	Bunker Man	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A Different Take On Bunker Man	I am somewhat reluctant to post a review only a few days after I've read the book but I've had Bunker Man on my 'to read' pile for several months.  I read all the reviews long before I bought the book but I finally decided it was something that I wanted to read despite the negative reviews, being  a fan of Scottish fiction.  And I've got to say that I was marginally  impressed.<br />To address previous reviews, yes, the book is graphic,  offensive, contains horrible language, is not a mystery, is hardly a  thriller, and lacks a certain amount of character development, as most of  it is spent on protagonist Robbie Catto.  Having said that, if you don't  mind any of the above, I think that Bunker Man is a fine piece of Scottish  fiction.<br />This book paints a rather unsettling picture of a school janitor  as he sinks into a psychotic paranoia.  And yet, the reader can't help but  see some good in him even after he's done his best to alienate himself from  society and the reader's sympathies.  At the very least McLean is gifted at  eliciting emotion from the reader.<br />If you're a devotee of Scottish  fiction and have a strong constitution, give it a try.  I was more than  happy I took the time to read it.  I guess its because of the presence of  the bunker, but I was immediately reminded of Iain Banks' similarly  controversial yet brilliant Wasp Factory.  McLean's style of fiction fits  well into that of his contemporaries such as Banks, Irvine Welsh, Alan  Warner and James Kelman.	1999-08-18

It might not be the sort of reading material one is necessarily used to and the setting would be largely unfamiliar to most Americans.  Neither of these reasons, however,  justifies not reading this  book.  If nothing else, it is a brave literary  experiment.  Somehow, Ryman is able to take the quickly delivered details  of the lives of 253 people (and a bird) and create an overriding powerful  story.  Read it!	1999-01-06

Present day?  I don't know and it doesn't really matter.  This is one wild book, so energetic that turing the last page and  finishing the book is remarkably like getting off of a rollercoaster.  Not  classic literature that will be forever remembered but a great deal of fun.	1999-01-06

Very impressive.  Amis is truly gifted.  By his  brilliant use of the English language, he gets the reader to look at things  his way.  While this is the goal of all writers, not many are as successful  as Amis.  The only drawback, hence the four stars instead of five, is the  ending.  While it was a very intriguing novel, I was left thinking that I  had missed something by the end of the book.  Either that, or Amis got a  little tired of writing and ended it prematurely.  All in all, however, it  was well worth the read.	1998-10-09

But I kept reading anyway.  Smith's  language is, indeed, beautiful.  Unfortunately, language is only one of the  many facets of a well written, well thought out novel.  Smith has developed  a small slice of the world that used to be part of the United States,  shrouded it with the mystery of its past and introduced its inhabitants and  the strange problems surrounding the lives and deaths of their children.   But nowhere does Smith answer any of the questions she has posed.  Nowhere  does she explain the truth behind the mystery.  The characters are  underdeveloped and I could find myself caring less about their fate.  And  her ideas about adaptation and evolution are just plain silly.  It would  take much longer for the evolutionary or adaptive process Smith is  describing to take place than she has allowed for...certainly the ruins of  lighthouses would be nothing but dust by the time such evolutionary changes  in humans could take place.  The very foundation for Other Nature is, to  put it bluntly, bad.  There are better things out there to read.	1998-09-22
