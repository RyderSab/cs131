It doesn't lack in anything at all; complete with detail, orginality, suspense, and character depth. If  you're ever going to read a book, read this one (well, and the sequel too,  (Whatever Happened to Janie?&quot;). Happy reading!	1999-09-10

It's kind of dumb and pointless, and it drags big time. I'm disappointed in this book, because there's only one more until the whole Seniors series is over, Gradution  Day. With so many seniors left, we already know that lots of people will  survive. Read this book, but don't hold your breath.	1999-05-30

It's the most moving book I've probably ever read in my whole life. It's amazing how your life can change in one second, and Ann (or her editors) portrayed Mary  Anne's overnight life alter extremely well. When you finish reading this  book, you will almost definitely look around your atmosphere and feel a  warm, fuzzy feeling- LoL. Anyway, read this book- it's like no other BSC  book, and it's the last one. Can't wait for the new series, but I'll miss  the old one. At least there are 131 books to read over!	1999-05-30

But while Mary Anne was being interviewed, she seemed very out of character. She's almost never angry, though I guess we all have those days.  Also, Jessi's secret seemed a lot more shocking than Mary Anne's, and she  should've been in the summary. But it was still a great book, so I suggest  you read it.	1999-05-27

Personally, I think Sweet Valley Twins was a much better series. I don't know why Pascal, who was such a good writer before, had to twist Jessica and Elizabeth's lives  around so drastically. That's totally unrealistic. I'll stick with the old  series.	1999-05-02

For one thing, you already know who the &quot;killer&quot; is in the middle of the book. Also, Jan and Dawn put so much emphasis on their bottle of Evian water,  that you KNOW it will be somehow related to the ending- which didn't make  sense anyway. The book is also really gross when it deals with the frogs. I  know it's a Fear Street book, but that was just digusting.	1999-05-01

But the summary was pretty far off from the real plot. After D.J.'s party for getting good grades in college, Stephanie feels like she needs to win something. So, she decides to run for  class president. But there's a problem; Allie, her best friend, is running  for president too. Stephanie goes all out in her campaign, giving away  candy, pulling showy-stunts, while Allie's campaign is much more  conservative, and only focuses on the school's issues. Allie and Stephanie  aren't really getting along, so Allie decides to drop out and become  Stephanie's running mate. Then, Stephanie and Allie win! But things aren't  turning out the way Stephanie plans. She forgets almost everything for the  student councel, and Allie does all of Stephanie's work. Finally, Stephanie  realizes that she can no longer be president, since she can't handle the  job. But Steph is already president and stuck! Uh-oh. How will she get out  of this mess?	1999-04-06

First of all, Kristy and Abby are 13, and they don't seem to have a mature interest in guys. That's kind of unrealistic, but that's not really the reason I didn't favor the  book. The plot is sort of boring. It might be a good subplot, but not a  real plot. It dragged, and it was pretty tedious to say the least. I really  don't suggest you read this book.	1999-04-05

Just because Claud isn't exactly like her family, and not some genius like Janine, that is no reason to find out if she is adopted! That's plain dumb.

Anyway, Darcy's birthday is coming up, and  Stephanie, along with Allie and Maura want to throw her a surprise party.  Meanwhile, Darcy has been getting up early to help Alex run, so he'll win  the huge track competition. But then, Darcy's mom finds out, and tells her  she can only run three days a week with Alex. So Darcy forces Stephanie to  run with him the other two days. At first, Stephanie doesn't like getting  up early, but then, she finds herself falling head over heels for Alex, and  Alex likes her too. Soon, Stephanie is dating Alex, behind Darcy's back.  Then, Darcy finds out. She is furious at both Stephanie and Alex. Stephanie  is pretty upset too, but she reminds herself she at least has Alex, even if  she feels horrible about it. Then Stephanie sees Alex at the mall kissing  another girl! Now Stephanie feels REALLY upset. She gave up her friendship  with Darcy for a guy who's cheating on her. When Darcy finds out that Alex  was kissing the girl at the mall, she and Stephanie team up to give Alex a  taste of his own medicine!	1999-03-14

Poor Mallory ranks as one of the top five BSC books ever written. It was fabulous. Mallory's father has just lost his job. Mallory tries to help her family out, by forming the Pike club, and baby-sitting as much as she can.  She also studies extremely hard, because she feels the need to get straight  A's. Soon, a few snobby girls find out about Mallory's father, and make fun  of her and her dad. Meanwhile, Mal has taken a daily job at the Delaney's.  One problem: the kids are spoiled rotten. They have a real fountain and a  $400 cat.  With a father out of work, a group of snobs on her case, and two  rich kids to baby-sit for, will Mallory be able to handle it all? With the  help and support of the BSC, she just might.	1999-03-01

It was wonderful. The book is compiled by bestselling Sabrina the Teenage Witch authors. It is split into 8 chapters/days. Sunday-Sunday. On Sunday, Sabrina breaks a mirror and  prepares herself for a week of bad luck and 7 temptations. Monday, she  loses a very important interview. Tuesday, Harvey is hanging around with  some other girl whom Sabrina is envious of. Wednesday, Sabrina and Harvey  (also Salem) go to France, but Harvey thinks it's a dream and does some  pretty weird stuff! Thursday, Sabrina is forced to make Puzzle Babies which  totally drives her crazy. Friday, she ruins the school play. Saturday, she  sees into the future and sees a terrible one! Finally, Sabrina thinks her  week of bad luck. But her all-time worst temptation is yet to come... I  enjoyed this book a LOT.

And I have to agree that Claudia and the Terrible Truth is the strongest one ever written. But the thing is, people interpret it more as PHYSICAL abuse instead of EMOTIONAL abuse. Mr.  Nichols is not so much as physically abusive to his kids, he's more into  verbal abuse. In one part of the book, Claudia says something like &quot;I  remembered my parents not touching us when we were little...&quot; Or along  those lines. I mean, COME ON! Almost every single child has been slapped by  their parents before! Not because the PARENT is being mean, because the  CHILD is being bratty! The book makes you feel like you're in a bad  household if your mom has ever slapped you before!  Anyways, I didn't like  the book very much. The last straw was when Mr. Nichols slapped Joey.  Claudia and her mother shouldn't have been that dumb. They should've known  that Mr. Nichols was an abusive man and trusted their instinct.	1999-01-09

It starts out in 1965, at a New Year's Party a few seconds after mindnight, when Beth is trying to calm down Jeremy, a boy who is kind of wimpy and has just been the victim of a cruel  prank.  Jeremy is so angry after the prank is revealed, he leaves the party  and gets into his car. Beth comes along with him, and Jeremy begins to  drive along the icy roads.

Which means that Karen and her little brother are getting a nanny. Karen doesn't want a nanny. She is  tired of all of these changes. So Karen decides that her New Year's  resolution will be not to change. She  even makes a schedule! Karen can  only have smooth peanut butter on whole wheat bread for an after school  snack. She can only do homework between 4 to 5. She has to raise her hand  in school every other question. Even if Karen doesn't know the answer! This  schedule is making everyone go crazy! Especially Karen! What is she going  to do? Break her resolution, or keep it? Either way, her life will be  miserable! Meanwhile, Karen's mother is interviewing three nannies for  Karen and Andrew. Andrew liked the first one, but hated the second. Karen  didn't like the first one, but thought the second was okay. Will the third  nanny be okay with both Karen and Andrew? Karen's Nanny got five stars from  me. It was great. The only thing wrong with it was, the book was mainly  about Karen's NOT CHANGING resolution. Only a few chapters were about a  nanny. But the book was still great. Especially Karen and Addie's Project  Jupiter assignment. Read it!	1998-12-25

It's just like the other  Garfield Fat Cat 3-Packs, but it's in color. Also, they are based on  television episodes of Garfield. My favorite was 'A Garfield Christmas.' I  loved the price, and highly recommend it for holiday gifts.	1998-09-27
