This book can start the engine of my mind and direct my head to the positive direction. It teaches you to live your life in the fullest. Explanations in the book are straight forward and make good sense to me. The content of the book can be applied to anything you do in life. I am glad I read it.	2005-10-12

Since I am not religious I had a difficulty, but I am sure readers with Christian faith will find this book wonderful.<br /><br />This is an intellectual approach to the content of Bible, and because of it I find it readable even though I am non Christian. I think the author did a great favor to human kind to point out how we have freedom to define our lives.	2005-10-06

Its content is very dark as it deals with a character disorder. I interpret it as someone's troubled life as a choice yet the main character does not realize that she constantly choose the path without knowing it. As a literature I find it extremelyl well written yet the content is sad and depressing as readers read through in detail how her life gets screwed up. There is no help coming to her. She does not seek help at all.<br /><br />I moved from a very cold state in North to Florida after a brief vacation during winter, and I know what tropical weather does to people. After I moved to Florida I met many people from Canada who would do anything to stay in south Florida. It is not only hurricanes that are dangerous in tropical weather. What I believe is the tropical weather makes ones overly optimistic, believing that everything is going to be okay. Being optimistic is a good thing, but optimism under the influence of tropical weather detouches you from reality and causes serious consequences.<br /><br />I think this book has a psychological significance because it describes how people with character disorder think, act, and justify their behaviors as a result of the disorder.<br /><br />If the story was not this sad I would have given 5 stars, but this book gave me a chill in my spine as I finished reading it. But the intensity of the \\"after taste\\" of the book tells me that this story telling has a high quality as a literature. The ending does not have a specific direction and letting readers imagine (or hope to imagine ) how the main character would have lived the rest of her life. Its \\"open ended\\" ending is effective in some story tellings and certainly in Jackpot.	2005-09-18

I enjoyed this book, but this one is just a fun novel but not a literature. Though entertaining, it lacks the depth that other Murakami books have. I think Murakami's attraction is the \\"life and death\\" issue in stories, but this book is very light in terms of that. I still give 5 stars because I felt thrilled as the story evolves, and especially I enjoyed the feeling of Europe.<br /><br />I read this in the Japanese language (the orignial the way Murakami wrote) in a Japanese public library while I visited Japan. It took me about two hours (would have taken days if in English), and I thought it was like having watched a movie because a movie usually runs a little less than two hours and also the story is lighter than other Murakami books.<br /><br />However I may compliment this book, I don't consider this to be one of the best Murakami books.	2005-05-01

I saw advertisement banners in trains, buses, everywhere in town, and of course in bookstores, but I was a twisted kid then that I refused to read it just because everybody was reading it, thinking people were just after a trend that would go away after a while.<br /><br />Many years have passed without reading Murakami, and I now live in America, being told by Argentineans and Americans, that they like Murakami. After 12 years of not visiting Japan, I did visit Japan in 2004 and could no longer ignore Murakami's book because Norwegian Wood was still in every bookstore and even in train stations! People in Latin America and Europe are also reading Murakami, and I would only look stupid if they can talk about Murakami and I, a Japanese person, have no idea what it is. Casual talks at parties with intellects became a proof of my ignorance. So finally I read the famous \\"Norwegian Wood\\" in the original Japanese language while visiting Japan.<br /><br />I felt as if a huge hammer, as huge as a truck, hit my head at once. For years and years I was clinging to my own assumption of the silly pop writer, but now I cannot possibly deny the good quality of the writing when I finally read it. \\"Work of Art\\" was what I had to conclude.<br /><br />I don't like the cover design of the English version. I like the original cover design when the book was published in 1987 in Japan.	2005-05-01

But it is too bad I cannot buy this as it is out of print. Unlike other art books, this book is not limited to pictures but has lots of useful information to read.<br /><br />Agnes Martin died in December of 2004. I encountered her art in March of 2005. I have a lot of catching up to do, for she was in the art world for many many years until her death at age of 92. This book has certainly been helping me on the catching up.<br /><br />The best part of this book, to me, is the selected wrinting of Agnes Martin. Her writing, just like her art work, is characterized by contentment, conciseness, and beauty.<br /><br />This book is extremely informative for artists especially minimalist and abstract artists. Not only showing us her version of beauty, but also her version of the definition of good art and bad art are explained here in a very clear form. Agnes Martin was indeed an ORIGINAL being after all. This book comfirms it.	2005-04-30

His stories are so tangible that I don't feel like calling them stories as his writing is capable of making me feel that those stories are real. I, of course, know that they are made-up stories, but I think some people can make something feel as if tangible, and Murakami possesses such ability.<br /><br />Murakami, as he stated in one of his essays in another book, always deals with life and death. Living is dying because living implies death to come, and life does not exist without death coming. All of his stories get to the point of life and death, either directly or indirectly. That's why I like Murakami. Murakami remind me of the state of living - the bare fact that I am alive and will die. I will die someday. Therefore, I am alive now. I am an odd creature that has to read things like Murakami's in order to feel alive.<br /><br />This book is a collection of short stories. Although they all have something to do with the earthquake, they are independent from each other. Although each is short, none of them is short in its content and depth. Compared to his other books, this book does not require deep knowledge of Japanese culture, although it may help follow the stories if a reader is knowledgeable.	2005-04-28

Of course her death is not recorded in this book, but I felt as if the news about her death was a part the book. Her death was a part of Taos Moderns.<br /><br />I think Taos Moderns were interesting enough to make a movie about it because all the people who had something to do with it were interesting individuals - often out of ordinary.<br /><br />This book is informative if you are interested in any of Taos Modern artist or minimalism art.	2005-04-24

I am writing this several days after I saw the show.<br /><br />To me, the \\"mystery\\" was his paintings. Why do they look like more than mere images? Why other realism painting don't catch my attention like those of Wyeth's? His skills as a painter is without a doubt a perfection, but that's not it. What, then, does make his work special?<br /><br />That was all I wanted to know, and reading Chapters 1 and 2 were enough for me to draw my own conclusion. I found some important keywords that I don't list here because important keywords differ from person to person. I am sure if you read this book with a mission you can find some keywords that helps you - as a painter.<br /><br />I think that each chapter should have had a name instead of just chapter 2, chapter 3, and so forth because not everybody has time to read this thick book and not everybody is interested in knowing the every detail of the painter. Some chapter had less importance to me, although I am sure they may be important to other people. They were description of his family members and people who had something to do with the painter, but I find them too detail for my purpose of reading.<br /><br />I think this book can be compressed and will still be as good as it is if compressed wisely. It is too bad that a reader has to read the whole book to see what is written in each chapter. If I was a writer I would have had a chapter for Christina Olson, a chapter for Wyeth as a young person, a chapter for his inspiration, a chapter for the influence from his family especially his father, and so on. That way it is easier to read and go back to where you want to go back to find something that captured your attention. I had to flip pages after pages because the book is not organized.	2005-04-21

I would call this type of book \\"pathology book\\" in stead of calling it \\"recovery book.\\" It helps to understand why certain issues arise, but in life, what you do about it is more important than understanding it. This book left me so sad without a lead to a hope of living. The solution suggested in this book was not effective to me. It would have been better if a book had pathology part and EFFECTIVE treatment part.<br /><br />I believe readers should note that the book was written 15 years ago, and there has been much improvement in psychology and psychotherapy. I would have given five stars if this were to be written ten years ago, but due to the gap in time and situation, I had to reduce it to four stars. It is still a great book as far as understanding your association with your care takers.	2005-04-18

In some countries, France for instance, the organization is considered to be a cult.<br /><br />The content of the book itself is written very simple, and perhaps too simple. It is easy for people to start believing that the wisdom comes from Soka Gakkai International, but I would like to insist that the wisdom comes from Buddhism, not the organization.<br /><br />Instead of promoting Buddhism, the book's intention is to promote the organization. The Soka Gakkai International (SGI for short) believes that what they do is the ONLY correct religion in the whole world, and its members can be very aggressive in an attempt to bring you into the organization once you are hooked up with SGI.<br /><br />If you can use this book as self-help book and become more self-reliant instead of blaming everthing for yor life, good for you. But use it with caution. The content of the book is not too bad. The book is written in the way that even people whose reading skill is rather poor can read.	2005-04-18

If you have BPD or even if you don't have BPD, this book will help in some form. But treating BPD is not as easy as fixing a broken door or broken toilet. It takes so much time and patience. Above all, the individual with BPD must be motivated to get well.<br /><br />I even think that the publisher should make a self-help book with same content for general public because the methods used in this book can benefit any human being with any status of mental health. There are many enough menthods in the book that even though one method doesn't work for you there are plenty of options you can try next. There must be something that works for you. But do not self-treat yourself, though.<br /><br />Stop being sorry and start doing something.

When the book was written (1987), pshychotherapy was not as good as what they can offer today. Even in a year or two, things can improve, and psychotherapy and psychology are not the exceptions. It has been 18 years since this book was written. On the other hand, if I wrote this review 10 years ago, I would have given five stars.<br /><br />I think this book, written 18 years ago, may give today's readers an inaccurate impression of what therapy can do today. Although the description of Inner child is a very good one and it helps readers understand the nature of the life issues, I would like to warn that to readers.	2005-04-18

I would like to stress the importance of knowing how old this type of book is. This one was published in 1992 - 13 years ago. Just like science and technology, psychotherapy develops and improves. In 1992, BPD was considered to be a difficult-to-treat or even almost-impossible-to-treat condition. Treating it may still be difficult today (2005), but things are quite different than 13 years ago. Mental health services throughout the USA are much more prepared to treat the condition now.<br /><br />This book did a good job in explaining what BPD is in the way that most people with no knowledge of psychology can understand and start recognizing BPD. Unfortunately a typical BPD book for general public lacks the lead to treatment, and this book is not an exception.<br /><br />A reader already familiar with BPD may find nothing new in this book.

Above all, Ivan Ilyich is an imaginary person who did not and does not exist at all. Yet, the description of how this man felt while he was dying feels so real. I once read a theory, somewhere I don't recall, that the moment you are dying is the summation of how you lived your life and until you are about to die you will never know how your life has been.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately I cannot testify the truthfulness of the theory as I obviously have not experienced the moment of my death. However, I can speculate how I may feel if I must die next week, tomorrow, or even later on today. Then I realize that we all tend to be in a strong denial as far as death is concerned, although death is the undeniable reality that coexists with life. The fact of living now means death will come for the most accurate certainty. That's why ancient wisdom called Buddhism created something called \\"meditation on death\\" By realizing death as a reality, we realize the fact of being alive and we can actively live instead of passively passing the lifetime without actually living lives.  <br /> <br />Some quotes I find significant to me: <br /> <br />\\"Everything you lived by and still live by is a lie, a deception that blinds you from the reality of life and death.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Perhaps I did not live as I should have, but how could that be when I did everything one is supposed to?  Then what do you want now?  To live?  Live how?  Live as you did in court when the usher proclaimed: The court is open! The court is open, open, Now comes the judgment! But I'm not guilty! What is this for?\\" <br /> <br />My interpretation of this novel is that Ivan Ilyich realized that he did not live a real meaningful life of his own. Only his realization of death as a reality enabled him to open his eyes to happiness, which he did not have though he thought he did have, and when the realization came to him, it was too late. So he would try to deny death yet find it impossible to do so. Then he would try to deny the reality, concluding internally that his reality is unreal, in an attempt to make him feel less miserable.    <br /> <br />Very well written novel, indeed.	2005-04-16

The author calls a person who wants to be heterosexual, a \\"struggler.\\" I like that name. The book, however, is written realistically. It states that the change from gay to ex-gay is harder if the struggler has already engaged in actual sexual activities instead of mere thoughts.<br /><br />I did not know that pre-gay had a hard time being accepted by LGBT public. I also did not know that \\"homosexual gene\\" was an unconfirmed statement. I did not know that it was possible for a gay to become a ex-gay. I did not know that there are a group of people who believe that most homosexual feelings are strongly related to the relationships with caretakers while growing up.<br /><br />I appreciate the way the author expect those who do not want to change the way they are and accept them the way they are instead of trying to convince them to become ex-gay.<br /><br />Though I know of the teaching of Christ, I do not call myself a Christian. With that being said, the book was still informative to me. If I were to be a Christian I would have been able to relate to the religious content of the book, but I did my best to understand it.  The focus of this book is not to convince something. The focus of this book is unconditional love and useful support in case someone wants to come out of homosexual feelings and also information to those who do not want to change so they can understand what ex-gay is all about.<br /><br />I am heterosexual, but I enjoyed this book, leaning things I did not know. Though the author is very religious, I did not feel the pushiness I often feel from other books by religious authors. I recommend this book to anyone with any sexual orientation, any religious background, and any vocation.	2005-04-15

But I believe that people who are determined to end their lives will do so eventurally no matter how we try to stop it. I hear lots of suicide that ended up in taking so long and so painful. Those who really want to die already experienced so much pain mentally and physically prior to the suicide, and I believe that at least when they die it should be painless as they don't need more pain on top of the pain they went through.<br /><br />If I could choose, I would like to die from a natural cause, that is, an old age. That is my choice, and as much as my choice being vaild, I value other people's choices. Everyone has a different curcumstances, and I don't think I completely understand how others feel. I wish I could help all beings, but I am very limited.<br /><br />Since I have not read this book, it is impossible to tell if the content is fit in terms of physiological effectiveness.

This book should have been<br />targeted to both Japanese intellects who can read<br />English and non-Japanese intellects who can read<br />some Japanese and Chinese texts. As a Japanese<br />reader who can read English, I found myself<br />frustrated as I read it.<br /><br />It should have dauntlessly had more Japanese<br />texts in parentheses to supplement the<br />understanding and facilitate the further readings<br />for the above mentioned readers. The book already<br />has a glossary and notes with Japanese texts just<br />for some terminologies, but in a sporadic way.<br />The incomplete insertion of Japanese texts, as<br />odd bits of information, created an inconvenience<br />to Japanese readers. Those words in italic all<br />should have had Japanese texts in parentheses.<br />Those were Buddhism terminologies, names of<br />people, and old literatures, and I was unable to<br />identify the exact kanji(Chinese) for some words<br />due to the poor references in Japanese texts even<br />though I am a native Japanese reader.<br /><br />If you can read Japanese, Amazon Japan<br />(www.amazon.co.jp) has reviews on this same book,<br />and you can find the same complaints described as<br />a weakness of this book. This weakness, however,<br />is a small weakness and does not cause me to<br />value this book any less.<br /><br />I had skeptically read this book, considering the<br />author being non-Japanese. However, I must<br />conclude that the author describes Japanese<br />culture and history quite accurately. The degree<br />of his understanding of Japan deserves a high<br />respect. To those who have a strong interest in<br />Japan, not limited to martial arts, will find<br />plenty of information in this book, for history,<br />politics, religion, philosophy, culture, and art,<br />as well as Miyamoto Musashi's portrait, are dealt<br />with in this book.<br /><br />I would assume casual martial arts fans may find<br />it difficult to read as its content far more<br />elaborate than my expectation.

If you understand the content of this book well, the illustrations make you laugh heartily. I find them entertaining.<br /><br />I would have never understood what Kierkegaard's work is all about if I didn't start with this book because Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) is said to have used more ink than anyone on Earth, having written more than what an average person can read in one lifetime. I would have understood nothing if I had to read several of his major books and try to figure out what they are all about. The author did a great job in summarizing his philosophy.<br /><br />Though Christianity pervades his work, I do not think his philosophy is about Christianity. Instead I would say that he established a universal philosophy by using concepts of Christianity. In other words, his philosophy can be applied to any area of life in any culture.<br /><br />One can spend money on a book and let that book sit somewhere, but this type of book becomes valuable when digested with effort. It becomes something money cannot buy.	2004-12-28

I have read several of his books in Japanese, the original language Murakami's books were written in. The only reason why I read this in English was because a friend of mine gave it to me on my birthday. I usually find translated books not as good as the ones in the original language, but this book impressed me to the extent that I even forgot it was a translation while reading it.<br /><br />Having read the book, I wondered how many writers, in the whole world, are capable of writing people's life stories like Murakami did in this book. He wrote those reports of people's experiences concisely as though they are beautiful music pieces. Murakami is not a typical Japanese person. He is different in that he is capable of viewing Japanese people and culture as an outsider. Yet he is not an outsider. He is as Japanese as other Japanese. \\"Underground,\\" however, is beyond the scope of being Japanese or non Japanese. It is in the scope of humanity. I believe only Murakami could possibly write a book like this one. Also, this book differes from other books of Murakami's in that \\"Underground\\" is a unique form of a documentary whereas others are considered novels or journals.<br /><br />One of the most talented writers alive in this era put his version of humanity in a book that could not have been written by anyone else in any other time. That's \\"Underground.\\"	2004-12-05

I find it helpful understanding why we dream and how we can use dreams to get in touch with our mind in a way that we cannot do while we are awake. The book does not end with mere interpretations of dreams; instead, it explains what we can do when we have dreams with negative implications. Also the book explains some dreams have less importance and need no interpretations. Having read this book, I no longer feel that a scary dream simply means something bad. The use of this book requires no knowledge of Kabbalistic views. I recommend this book to those who are wondering what dreaming itself means and how dreams correlate to actual life.	2004-12-05

The content is simple enough for anyone to understand, but I got an impression that the book oversimplified matters. In other words, it lacks solid explanations of the actual specific information in terms of psychology and philosophy. Without such explanations, there is nothing unique about Kabbalah, for I find other religions, psychotherapies, and even cults using same arguments about operating our lives by taking responsibility for our actions. Also, I believe if the book eliminated repetition, it would have been a much thinner book with a less expensive price.<br /><br />Kabbalah does not exclusively represent the transformation of our lives by understanding how the mind works, but this book presents it as the only source of this wisdom. Anybody who has studied other major religions easily realizes that the ideas introduced in this book appear also in other faiths. After all, it does not matter where the idea came from originally. Regardless of the source of the wisdom, by either calling it Kabbalah or Buddhism or whatever, the laws of life and universe are the same. Whether or not the author has been exposed to other ancient religious knowledge is unknown to me, but except for the \\"only-Kabbalah-can-help-you\\" atmosphere, the book represents how life and the universe work in ways that are beyond our comprehensions.	2004-12-05
