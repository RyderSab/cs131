When I showed this book to my son he was very excited and proceeded to skim through the pages. Not even half way through Why Do Volcanoes Blow Their Tops? Questions and Answers About Volcanoes and Earthquakes, he found a page that portrayed a volcano model to do in your own home. In four easy steps the picture guides you along with the text on watching your own volcano blow its top.<br /><br />This was truly the highlight of the book for my two children and they insist on repeating this experiment. But on to the forty-eight pages of the book that includes an index at the back listing where you can find craters, epicenter, foreshocks, landslides, lava, nuclear bomb, seaquakes and volcanic ash. The illustrations portray craters, ash and eruptions in various stages and color.<br /><br />The authors also welcome letters from any readers that have experienced either a Volcano or Earthquake as they prefer research to experience on these matters. There are answers to seventy-eight questions on both these topics. A Volcano will erupt due to pressure. Lava comes out as a red-hot liquid before it cools and becomes solid. A cinder Volcano is when rock and ash shoot into the air and fall back around the opening. Composite Volcanoes are also known as Strato Volcanoes, which would be the Mount Fuji in Japan.<br /><br />At the top of Volcanoes are craters that can be measure from a few feet to one mile. Australia is the only continent where a Volcano does not exist. They are near the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean Sea. Rift Volcanoes erupt under the sea and happen more frequently than Volcanoes on land. Venus and Mars also have Volcanoes.<br /><br />I felt that Why Do Volcanoes Blow Their Tops? Questions and Answers About Volcanoes and Earthquakes was quite fascinating and worth investing in for the facts and details on these two events that can happen at any given time.<br /><br />The recommended age is from kindergarten to second grade and older as well as adults. I learned much about Volcanoes that I never knew about or thought I would care to know but found it informative as well as always wanting to know about Earthquakes. This happens when you live in what we call \\"earthquake country\\".ts.

The best aspect for me was the photos of moles and the chapter on skin warning signs.<br /><br />Part I of the book starts with recognizing and preventing melanoma.  Part II of the book focuses on Melanoma and the treatment.  Part III is the less common types along with research.<br /><br />I found this book to be a wonderful resource as I hit 45.  The diagrams are useful as well.	2005-09-13

They listen intently to the lady from the principal's office\\" when she visits them with a box of papers. These boxes contained some tests. All the students were lined up in their desks with pencils in hand as the teacher explained to read the questions carefully. Then take your pencil and fill in the box next to the right answer. You must work quickly.\\"<br /><br />George was the first to raise his hand and ask a question. It seems that the first set of questions were puzzling to George. rabbits eat: lettuce, dog food, sandwiches.<br /><br />The next question was just as puzzling to Sammy when asking what firemen do. This time he nudged another student to tell him what he thought about firemen getting their heads stuck. The next question is even better because the picture is of a girl and boy and the student has to pick which one is taller. This time Jim struggled with trying to figure out what kind of sandwich the girl was holding and what that had to do with the picture.<br /><br />When the teacher informed the students that it was time to stop taking the tests many of them hollered out they were not finished. Anna Maria was the only one who had completed the test on time and boasted to the others how easy it was. The next day the lady from the principal's office stopped by to take Anna Maria down the hall to a new classroom. \\" Anna Maria is in the special class because she did a good test!<br /><br />This is when they all started calling each other \\"dummy\\". On these pages the students have been seen drawing with crayons, building blocks, petting a rabbit in a cage and playing with a stuffed animal. The girls always had on sweaters over their dresses with the boys in overalls and long striped shirts. Their teacher wore flowery dresses and had a vase of flowers on her desk.<br /><br />I thought First Grade Takes A Test did not accurately portray what takes place daily in the first grade. It seemed similar to Kindergarten instead, then again school standards have changed a lot since this was printed.<br /><br />The illustrations appear to be watercolor and have the little dots for the eyes, nose and mouth. At least the children were drinking from milk cartons with straws which is not always the case now at school functions. Teachers certainly do not dress like this anymore nor do the children.er wore flowery dresses and had a vase of flowers on her desk. <br /> <br />I thought First Grade Takes A Test did not accurately portray what takes place daily in the first grade.

(Pooh: Just Be Nice)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Help Eeyore Find his Tail	A nice tale of friends coming to the aid of another who lost something of importance.<br /><br />The cover features the lovable Donkey known in the Hundred Acre Wood as Eeyore. The story begins with Eeyore waking up to find his tail is once again missing. The picture shows the tree branches all lined up to form his fort where he calls home. In most stories that include Eeyore if his tail is not missing than his house is usually destroyed.<br /><br />The next page has Eeyore looking for his tail in his favorite thistle patch. Now I have never heard this term used on any video or when watching the television show or on cable. I looked up \\"thistle\\" in the dictionary to learn it means \\"weedy plants having prickly leaves and bracts and usu. purple flowers\\". I used The American Heritage Dictionary, third edition. If you are reading to a child who asks what each word means that is in the story you might have to utilize a dictionary like I did for the correct answer. My only problem was now I had to look up \\"bracts\\" since I did not want my son to think I was using the word \\"brats\\", they do sound similar!<br /><br />Well before you put that dictionary away just yet the next page talks about searching in the \\"bog\\" where Eeyore gets stuck every day. I must have missed all those videos and episodes, never heard them say \\"bog\\" before! The meaning is \\"An area of soft, naturally waterlogged ground\\".<br /><br />Once Eeyore left the bog he went into the cave where he would hide from dragonflies, only they followed him in. Eeyore decides to find his friends to enlist their help in finding his tail. Eeyore arrives at the window of Pooh's house to see Pooh on his chair eating honey. As soon as he is done with the honey Pooh tells Eeyore he will help him find his tail.<br /><br />Just Be Nice...and help a friend is in an easy to read format for any fan of the show Winnie the Pooh. The cover has a great picture of Eeyore with a smile, not a sad face for a change.<br /><br />In the end all the animals come together to celebrate friendship and finding the tail for Eeyore. It shows how the animals each chose to continue with their own plans and once done they did not disappoint or forget their friend. When they all gathered each one questioned their decision in choosing their own chores over helping a friend and this made them think of others as well as themselves.r />In the end all the animals come together to celebrate friendship and finding the tail for Eeyore.

The book has about twenty-three pages with Sooki meeting other animals in the jungle.<br /><br />The Sappy Baggy Elephant begins with him dancing around in the jungle. While dancing his feet would pound the jungle so that it shook all around. Next his kicking would knock over trees as he continued further into the jungle.<br /><br />One day he met a parrot that asked him why he was shaking the jungle to pieces and asked him just what kind of animal he was. In answer to this question the elephant replied he had no idea what he was since he was alone. He had given himself the name Sooki and thought it suited him well. The parrot told Sooki that his ears and his nose were too big for him. He also thought his skin was much too big for him and suggested his name be Saggy-Baggy.<br /><br />The Saggy Baggy Elephant is a nice story of the elephant fitting in after all and finding his own kind in the jungle. This is a quick read and small enough for a toddler to hold and help turn the pages. The pictures are detailed and colorful.<br /><br />Many children can identify with the elephant feeling discouraged due to his large ears, nose and wrinkly skin. Along the way he meets many other animals similar to the way a child meets new kids that might not be friendly at first. We like to read this a few times a week. My son likes to see the page with the crocodile and the elephant blowing water out his trunk having fun. This also reminds me of the elephant scene with Bill Murray in the movie, Larger Than Life.	2005-09-13

It has become enjoyable to follow the stories of this first grade class and see how it applies to today's schooling.<br /><br />The boys wear long sleeved striped shirts while the girls have flowing dresses with tights on and ribbons in their hair. Both boys and girls wear sweaters to so this indicates the time of year must be winter. The children represent multi-cultures and have dots for their eyes and nose. These kids bring lunch in either paper bags or boxes and have a thermos for the drink.<br /><br />In Jim Meets the Thing many of the kids are wearing scarves around their necks. Lunch is outside within the playground with the boys and girls playing on the swings, with a ball and climbing a jungle gym. The story begins with Jim at home in front of the television watching a show entitled The Thing. He was so scared that night he could not sleep thinking that The Thing would come out of the television set to get him.<br /><br />Upon his arrival at school the kids were gathered at the playground discussing The Thing. Danny loved it, Willy thought The Thing was very strong and Anna Maria liked when The Thing swallowed the car with four people in it. Jim wanted the conversation to stop. The kids were inside now hanging up their sweaters, hats and scarves when Jim said not to talk about The Thing anymore. The teasing started but no one paid attention to Jim as he tried to tell the others that he was not scared. Silently Jim wondered if he was the only kid in first grade to be get scared.<br /><br />My son liked reading Jim Meets the Thing and laughing about what the kids thought was scary and seeing how they played on the playground. My son was able to read this through in under an hour and is able to recite the names of the classmates with ease now that he has read So What?, Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire! and First Grade Takes a Test. Some of the words he got stuck on were gymnastics, squashed and Dracula.<br /><br />Reading through the books in the Welcome to First Grade! series gives me a little glimpse into the daily happenings of kids as they spend the day at school.

I liked having this data listed so I could make adjustments in my diet.<br /><br />The book covers MSG, eggs, sweeteners, binge eating, time management, allergies, food sensitivities and much more in six steps to follow.<br /><br />I already eliminated Aspartame from my diet and liked seeing the list of what types of items this can be found in.  The book also touched on the confusion between assertive and aggressive - an issue I have faced many times in deciphering the two meanings.<br /><br />There is a food seduction test in step two.  The index is extensive and covers every aspect for this no-diet plan to permanent weight loss.	2005-09-12

We have started working on it this summer to help learn what will be covered during the fourth grade.<br /><br />I was happy to read that the library plays an important role in the fourth grade since my son loves visiting there on a daily basis.  He started going during recess to the library the last part of third grade and soon other kids went along.<br /><br />We just got test results in mail today so my son does not need to focus on math (95%) and I noticed that the activities were a bit childish and things he has gone over in 2nd and 3rd grade.<br /><br />We liked reading about social studies is an important aspect of the fourth grade and have been studying this section to get a grasp on the subject.<br /><br />Each section has general tips and test preparedness and it is laid out in an easy to read format - especially for the student/child to grasp.<br /><br />School supplies and testing standards are covered, friendships, peer interactions and crushes are explored.  I was not pleased to read how many children start drinking and snorting items in the fourth grade.<br /><br />Do make sure you read the section on responsibilities of the parents and follow the plan.  This is a good book to keep for the year and then pass it on.	2005-08-25

The book is helpful to perimenopausal women since we are prone to toxic stress. There is a list of what triggers this stress that settles in around the waistline. We must learn how to distinguish between hunger and stress induced appetite. Hormones play a big part in how we consume food during various times of the month as well.<br /><br />The book is presented in two parts that includes the three templates of stress-resilient regrouping, nutrition and physical activity. There is also a chapter on how to learn to lift weight to lose the weight. Part I goes into how stress puts on fat. There is also a glossary, index, listing of major muscle groups as well as a walking test.<br /><br />The woman who are in this age group now are also the first ones to have been on the pill so this is interesting to the researchers on dieting and stress. Many years ago physical activity was a major part of daily life but that has changed over the years with this generation suffering.<br /><br />Before you can begin the weight training you need to evaluate and assess your level. Fight Fat After Forty has two worksheets to complete the same day as the heart check is done. The keep it sublimely simple (KISS) home workout plan is the primer for the over forty woman with the reminder to drink plenty of water and avoid dehydration. The saying, \\"fitness over forty rules\\" seems to work for me!<br /><br />Fight Fat After Forty is based on research from the National Institute of Health. Dr. Peeke is a clinician and scientist who first read about Stress and eating in an article in Shape magazine back in 1988 that spoke of the correlation between stress and fat. There are many stages of stress, which result in making you sick, fat and frazzled. I have used the term frazzled to describe me many times.<br /><br />I feel this is a book to start reading at the age of thirty-five to identify your target stress factors, changing the way you identify foods and implement an exercise plan that is life long benefiting.

The times my son was in the Hospital it was suggested he get a g-tube and I found relevant information under the chapter, Feeding the Child with Special Needs.<br /><br />In this chapter an eating phobic child is discussed and the addition of a behaviorist. It is also discussed how to teach a child the steps in chewing and swallowing. There are children who have poor muscle control and those that were tube fed that might have issues now with gagging and the muscles at the back of the throat get tight.<br /><br />There is another useful chapter, Nutritional Tactics for Preventing Food Fights where the author was referred by another Dietitian to a Mother with a 2.5 year old who would not eat very much. The author wanted to go to observe the parent feeding the child but this Mother took issue with that. The alternative was to have the parent videotape the feeding process. I felt better realizing that I was on the right track when I had a nurse consultant over for the very same thing.<br /><br />What I was not happy about in this book was the numerous times she made reference to another chapter where you will find this subject. I spent a great deal of time flipping around trying to get the whole scope on these issues. Most of the information I felt was pretty basic for newborns and toddlers. It is explained also about the developmental chart and how children are progressing at their doctor visits.<br /><br />I feel the discussion of eating disorders should be included which this book talked on. I feel there is an anorexic factor that needs to be looked at but felt How to get your kid to eat...but not too much did not assist me in that chapter. This seemed to be more about teenage girls and the typical eating disorders.<br /><br />I felt the book helped me learn more in seeing the big picture and I learned some techniques on how to get my son to take some food.<br /><br />The Appendix has tools and strategies that include the portions and sizes for meat, vegetables and the food groups. The milk group portions are included as well choosing nutritious snacks. The index is easy to use for specific areas you want to read without wading through all the chapters. You can find pages of help under breastfeeding, dieting, feeding cues, genetics, hunger and obesity.<br /><br />This book would help any parent who is at the toddler stage, a first time parent trying to experiment with solid foods and those who are working in the fields for eating disorders, disabilities and nurses aides.g picture and I learned some techniques on how to get my son to take some food. <br /> <br />The Appendix has tools and strategies that include the portions and sizes for meat, vegetables and the food groups.

Books	5	100	101	N	N	If only it were that simple a command - Just Take a Bite	The cover of Just Take a Bite is adorable.  My nine-year old son has severe autism, is non-verbal and has feeding deficits.  For three years now he has been attending feeding therapy.<br /><br />The chapter covering the stages of sensory development for eating was very informative. This is very similar to what has been utilized in the feeding therapy we attend on a weekly basis.<br /><br />The case studies are highlighted in gray throughout the chapters. The ages range from babies through elementary age. Issues covered include steps to create a meal or snack schedule, awareness of movement, limited communication skills, vestibular movement, behavioral factors and visual stimuli.<br /><br />Each chapter has a gray box with an exercise in eating, which are tips and guidelines for the specific area being discussed. There is a table listing textures with a description, example of foods with this texture and how the child can succeed with these textures.<br /><br />You begin with three new foods to the child. The procedures and materials are all listed for the steps. The cue cards are in black and white and a bit advanced for my son.  This is the perfect book for preschoolers and toddlers who are resistant eaters.<br /><br />There are many activities for the preschool aged child to explore with a parent, teacher or therapist.  The section on food jags is reassuring to parents.<br /><br />This is a great first book to read in the area of eating issues.  I wish this had been published several years earlier so we could have progressed quicker.  If you think your child needs feeding therapy - Just Take a Bite should be read so you can start implementing these suggestions.	2005-06-26

I am very glad I purchased this book since it covered Deodorant, shaving, growth spurts and using a urinal.<br /><br />My 10 year old is high functioning and his almost nine year old sibling is non-verbal and could benefit from some of the chapters as he gets older.<br /><br />Throughout the book the stories are told in various points of views, either in the first, second or third person. Visual cues, communication aides and assistive technology is shown within the chapters. Mary also suggests starting self-care skills as young as three for brushing teeth and washing hands.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the fonts change throughout the book. The pages that discuss developing a program and teaching various skills are presented in an easy to read manner, mostly for the adults teaching the curriculum. The remaining pages are activities and social stories that have larger fonts that are bolded. This seems to be easier to follow for my son as well.<br /><br />All the diagrams inside are in black and white, plus the cover is not overstated and should not be embarassing to a pre-teen or teen.<br /><br />Your student or child will not read about birth control, sexual intercourse, reproduction or sexually transmitted diseases. It is recommended to supplement this curriculum as the students become young adults. I was glad to know these issues would not be covered, yet my son ran into two words when looking up puberty in the dictionary - reproductive and sexually.<br /><br />He was disappointed not to find a glossary, but liked learning about growing a mustache and how old he would be when he finally gets to high school.<br /><br />None of the steps listed in the book are numbered, which I think is a good thing so the students do not get stuck on certain numbers instead of the actual steps.<br /><br />The information presented is repetitious in nature, but that is needed when teaching children on the autism spectrum.  There is plenty of room for note taking and creating your own social stories.

At the back of the book Ann Martin mentions this and the book she wrote before The Babysitters Club series, entitled, Inside Out.<br /><br />Introducing a character with autism in The Babysitter series was a good idea, just presented in a way I did not like.  Having a child with autism should never be a secret.  This book is a start by educating children about those with autism.<br /><br />The premise of The Babysitters Club is to meet three times a week for thirty minutes to get calls for sitting jobs. Each of the members has a title and function. Kristy and The Secret of Susan is written in the third person, by Kristy. Kristy is President of the Babysitters Club, thirteen years old and in the eighth grade.<br /><br />There is a Babysitters Club notebook that contains the writeup of all the jobs they do. They learn how their friends solve problems and what is going on with the kids they watch.<br /><br />I often found myself looking back to the beginning recap on each of the members since it was confusing to recall the sibling names for all the girls.<br /><br />The reason for me perusing The Babysitters Club #32, Kristy and The Secret of Susan was due to the topic of autism, so I tried to keep track of all the members.<br /><br />One day Mrs. Felder called to get someone to sit Susan. Susan went to a special school far away, currently home for one month before heading off to another new school.  Mrs. Felder wanted a sitter for three days a weeks from 3:30 - 5:30, so she could have a break. Mrs. Felder mentioned to Kristy on the phone that Susan was autistic.<br /><br />At the Babysitters Club meeting the girls discussed what autistic meant. Kristy looked the word up in the dictionary, which mentioned Childhood Schizophrenia. When checking that word out Kristy became more confused, \\"withdrawing from reality\\".<br /><br />I liked that the storyline had them check the dictionary. In fact that was the first place I looked when I read \\"autistic like\\" in a report seven years ago relating to my own son.<br /><br />Right away I had mixed feelings about Mrs. Felder. It did not seem right to me as the single parent to two boys on the autism spectrum that this parent needed so many breaks during a one-month period her eight year old autistic daughter was home. I felt this was the wrong message and would have preferred if she needed to keep up with some obligations she had year-long. It seemed a bit drastic for respite time with the time-period chosen.<br /><br />We learn that Susan plays the piano and remembers dates. She can sing and recite music she just heard, but does not speak. Although not mentioned within the pages of The Babysitters Club, Kristy and The Secret of Susan these are savant skills that affect about 10% of the autistic population.<br /><br />Susan is in her own world, she wrings her hands, clicks her tongue and rarely makes eye contact. Her yard is fenced in for she gallops back and forth. My son is also eight and he has been skipping merrily along for several years now and does not speak either.<br /><br />The month went by quickly and then it was time for Kristy to help Mrs. Felder pack for Susan and say goodbye. This was when Kristy met Mr. Felder and told him of her dream to keep Susan home with them and make friends in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Mr. Felder explained to Kristy about the special school and how they used music to get through to kids. It was also shared that Mrs. Felder was going to have another baby.<br /><br />Kristy thought about being a teacher working with special kids like Susan. The Babysitters Club, Kristy and The Secret of Susan covers fifteen chapters within 145 pages. It is a quick read for a pre-teen or teenager. It might be helpful for a sibling to see how others in their age group learn about autism through trial and error.<br /><br />Although the reader hadsome insight into the special talents of Susan, it was not really made clear why she needed the special school far away from home. It almost seemed like since Mrs. Felder was having another baby that they shipped off Susan so they could be the family they had wanted.<br /><br />This book is from 1990 and attitudes were different regarding disabilities and autism..  <br /> <br />Although the reader had some insight into the special talents of Susan, it was not really made clear why she needed the special school far away from home.

His mother wants his room cleaned up before it looks like a Pigsty. This first picture of Wendell makes him appear to be older than one would believe. The facial features along with his hair seemed to indicate he was a young adult. The next page he enters his room with toys all around the room. There is a train set on the floor with farm animals, a football, pillow and stuffed green dinosaur. A book entitled Farm Animals also on the side of his bed looks like one a younger child would read.<br /><br />Wendell finds a surprise in his room upon his bed, a large pig. On the other side of the bed is an open window, which may explain how the pig landed in his bed. The very next page has the Pig eating potato chips and reading a strange stories book with the cover showing a pig behind the wheel of a car leaving a barn.<br /><br />Pigsty is an easy to read book with the pictures telling most of the story for someone not at the reading stage yet. For a child interested in animals this is fun to read and listen to the story. Wendell learns about taking responsibility for his room and puts his foot down to the pigs when he has had enough.<br /><br />Pigsty also shows team work among the animals and the boy with the best of both worlds having the pigs visit once a week for a game in a clean room. For a child who may like picking items out of the pictures this is a good book for that since you see the various items on the floor and can name them and see where they end up on the next page.	2004-11-06

A fun way for a beginning reader to see the good and bad ways of bedtime behavior with clever illustrations.<br /><br />Each of the thirty pages inside portray a different set of parents, dinosaur, room set up and items for each room. The beginning of the book emphasizes what many children have done when told to turn out the lights. The last few pages portray what should be done when told it is bedtime. The book is also done with rhymes with the first two pages showcasing all the dinosaurs on their beds with their names underneath. One is blowing bubbles, another jumping on the bed while others play together, eat or read a book.<br /><br />The parents also represent various nationalities in How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night? One mama is in an apron, one is casual while another appears to be dressed up. The papa(s) are in business attire holding a briefcase, hands over ears, wearing glasses and scratching his head. The last pages than show that Dinosaurs do not cry but give a big kiss, turn out the light, say good night and sleep like a good little Dinosaur.<br /><br />This is a fun book that can be read in many ways by trying to find all the differences in the rooms, the parents and the ten Dinosaur names. This would have appeal to any child that likes Dinosaurs and learning to read or already a reader. I would think the age limits are wide from a preschooler to possibly eight or nine years of age.	2004-11-06

With each page of text consisting of up to two paragraphs with one or two sentences this was a breeze for my son to read while marveling at the insects and plants. The last page of the Rookie Read-About® Science - Plants that Eat Animals lists an alphabetized index of said insects and plants as well as credits for all the photographs presented.<br /><br />The facts discussed inside Rookie Read-About® Science - Plants that Eat Animals begin by explaining All plants need water and minerals to grow. The photograph depicts the soil surrounding the plant. There is a photograph that captures a fly trapped inside a plant that gives the reader an eye view of this process clearer than the naked eye would allow.<br /><br />There is a photograph showing the leaves of a Venus's flytrap as well as how it looks when catching a cricket. Each of the leaves looks like a clam's shell with sharp spines and soft hairs inside. The leaves have a sweet juice smell that draws the insects in. Once an insect touches the hairs on the leaf they will snap shut until the plant has removed the minerals from the insect's body.<br /><br />For descriptive details on how plants eat animals perfectly suited for kids that can read. My son thought it was very neat to see the plants in action as they captured the insects. I had to remind him how he acted when he found a lizard in the front yard a few weeks ago and wanted to run it over with a tricycle. We went inside and watched it from the window safely. The text was easy for him to read as well as the underlying captions for each photograph.<br /><br />Even though my son is no rookie when it comes to animals and the topic of science, this still was a worthwhile book to borrow and learn through visualization how some plants we have never seen before go about catching insects for their meals.	2004-11-06

One evening at dinner his sister, D.W. announced that Arthur wanted a puppy.<br /><br />After his parents considered the options of having a pet they made Arthur a deal that if he could show them he was responsible he could get a puppy. Arthur and D.W. were trying to come up with ways to prove this that night in her room. At the table D.W. had her cash register advising Arthur to get a job to pay back the seven dollars he owed her. The pictures in the book are detailed showing the items in her room, such as a dollhouse, toy duck and rocking horse.<br /><br />For anyone that has watched any of the episodes of Arthur they know the dog is called Pal and a part of the show. The book is a nice story that has funny antics while watching pets, but shows how Arthur takes the business seriously and is rewarded in the end.<br /><br />The entire family shares in all responsibilities as is demonstrated through out the book with them making decisions together on the dog and caring for the visiting pets. Arthur sticks with the business at hand through the week he is caring for the pets and accounts for all of them. When presented with the dilemma of how to show his parents he can handle responsibility, Arthur sets out to accomplish that task.<br /><br />My six-year old at one time wanted a pet and loves Arthur's Pet Business. The book tackles the issues of caring for various pets by showing they need food, rest in their own sleeping sections, cleaning of their cages and plenty of fresh air by taking walks. Showing Arthur reading the dog care book and concern about Perky reinforces that having a pet is serious business.	2004-11-06

I Pledge Allegiance consists of forty pages with the first printing completed in 1990. This is a children's book offering easy to understand background on the history of The Pledge of Allegiance. The idea behind the book is to help children learn more about what they are reciting daily in their respective classrooms.<br /><br />The book begins with the 1880s as Henry Ford is building a buggy that runs on gasoline and electric lights coming into homes. Most of the pages contain a paragraph with a matching image, such as the skyscraper that stood eleven stories high being built in Chicago. Next the frontiers were becoming States. In 1888 there was a children's magazine called, the Youth's Companion that was delivered weekly through out the United States. \\" It was filled with adventure stories\\".<br /><br />The text within these pages has the key words to learn in bold - pledge, allegiance, Republic, Nation, indivisible, liberty and Justice. While the first four words were used within the same page to make comparisons of the meaning, the others needed one to two pages to guide the students. Republic was explained as a kind of government where everyone can vote with Nation being another term for country. The illustrations show the students in the classroom, people voting and the White House. Indivisible is when something cannot be divided or pulled apart. The illustration shows a war between the northern and southern states as an example.<br /><br />Most of this was difficult for my son to absorb, partly due to his disability and also he was not interested in learning this in one session. It helped to go over a few pages in I Pledge Allegiance daily so he could comprehend it fully. The students in the book all knew that liberty meant freedom and then learned that Justice was about being fair with the same laws for everyone. \\" The children now understood that they were promising to help the government of the United States give freedom to all and treat people.promising to help the government of the United States give freedom to all and treat people. <br />	2004-11-06

I saw the cover and placed the book in my cart at the store when purchasing videos. We have a collection of a Little Golden Book stories, as well as numerous books by Gina and Mercer Mayer.<br /><br />The book is written from the Little Critter's perspective beginning with the arrival of the new neighbor Zack and his family. Zack has rabbit ears like his Mother with a turtle shell like his Father.<br /><br />The two families greet one another by shaking hands on the front lawn. The girl critters have bows in their hair and the Mothers always have an apron on. Later in the day the critters have baseball practice when the subject about asking Zack to join gets shot down. The little critter speaks to his parents about how his friends made him mad by rejecting Zack. His Mother explains the good in being different.<br /><br />This family discussion takes place in the living room with the dog sleeping on the floor and the mouse and cat at the top of the couch. The Father has a magazine in his lap with the Mother laying a book on her lap. The expressions on their faces are very thorough showing the father thinking with his arm on his knee.<br /><br />Just A Little Different shows how even kids at first make judgements based on looks and similarities. This helps in showing how to reach out to others that may be different in appearance and the positive results once you get to know someone. The message is clear that persistence pays off and the family comes together to discuss how the critter feels in the beginning.<br /><br />The book shares the point that one person/critter can make a difference in how they perceive others. Once all the critters stopped looking at Zack and saw him for the fun person he was they got past the first impressions.<br /><br />There are many lessons in this short book that is easy to read and follow along with great pictures of the critters and surroundings. Each book in the Mayer's Little Critter series sends a message and offers tips for living life in various situations. Whether a new baby is arriving or time spent with a parent or a book about feelings, these are worth so much more than the small price tag placed on them.in the Mayer's Little Critter series sends a message and offers tips for living life in various situations.

Classic folktale in easy to read style by Scholastic.<br /><br />The Three Billy-Goats Gruff took ten minutes to read through for my son. We did stop and look at illustrations here and there, but my son was not too keen on them to begin with. There is a lot of repetitive lines in this story about the three billy-goats that trip and trap over the bridge, one at a time tricking the troll in the process. All three bill-goats have the same name, Gruff, but their appearances are different allowing the reader to identify each billy-goat.<br /><br />They all have bells around their necks, but the horns are shaped in other ways as well as the color of their fur in varying shades of brown. The billy-goats were going \\" up to the hillside to make themselves fat\\". The exact reason why was not given so if you have an inquisitive child you may have to expand on the folktale to speed the flow along. In order to get to this hillside they needed to cross over a bridge, where below an ugly Troll \\" with eyes as big as saucers and a nose as long as a poker\\" lived.<br /><br />My son had never heard the term \\"Troll\\" before and wanted an example of what eyes like saucers would look like. If anyone has ever worked with autistic kids you will find this often because they need examples in order to grasp the story, otherwise they take most of the details quite literally. When the billy-goats started the journey to the hillside the youngest crossed over the bridge first. In a rather loud voice, \\" WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge? Roared the Troll.\\" My son had difficulty with the word \\"roared\\" each time he came upon it. I changed my tone to show him what roared would mean, allowing him to continue further with the book, The Three Billy-Goats Gruff.<br /><br />The billy-goats did get very fat at the hillside, so much so they could not walk back home again. One more sentence that was hard to decipher for my son, \\" And if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why, they're still fat\\". I find it hard to explain how fat falls off of someone and did not attempt to try that one. His reaction was this was one silly book and eagerly placed it back in the book packet and into his backpack for tomorrow. I agree this was an interesting choice for homework reading.nd it hard to explain how fat falls off of someone and did not attempt to try that one.

However you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of The Doorbell Rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. The mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen.<br /><br />With just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. The favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. The Doorbell Rang begins with a Mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son Sam and daughter Victoria. \\" I've made some cookies for tea, said Ma\\". The children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to Grandma's.<br /><br />By flipping through the pages of the Doorbell Rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. The cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. More kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. It is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. The serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. Meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail.<br /><br />The final arrival for this story is Grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. All the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. Not very sanitary as far as I am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. The dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.<br /><br /> The portrayal of the Mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. The kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.<br /><br />At least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the Mother finally sat down. For a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read I highly doubt there would be interest. There is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's Grandma's cookies. There are roughly two to four sentences on each page. The good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this.inks at the table.

On the left page is the text with the right page showing Maisy doing each task to prepare for bedtime.<br /><br />Maisy has a toy panda that she likes to cuddle up with and the story starts with Maisy looking at the clock heading up the stairs with panda because they are sleepy and it is time for bed. Maisy wears a green jumper with a blue shirt.<br /><br />Once Maisy is in her room she walks over to the window to draw the curtains, placing the panda on the windowsill. The owl is outside the window hooting, while we see the stars and the moon one last time before closing the curtains.<br /><br />Maisy's Bedtime is a easy to follow format for any child to make part of their nightly routine. The similarities and routines for the mouse are the same for children of all ages. I think the only thing missing was going for the drink of water or milk like so many little ones do in stalling the inevitable bedtime.<br /><br />The book has great vibrant colors that are the same as on the television show. Maisy has the pink ears and tail while Panda is black with the white tummy and face.<br /><br />It would also be nice to have cassette tapes to go with the books so we could sing the Maisy song and hear the narrator's voice. Other than my two suggestions this is the perfect addition for the family library. Also the features of Maisy and the pictures are very easy to copy with my son drawing pictures of Maisy, plus we have the coloring book.	2004-11-06

I figured he would enjoy exploring the activities among the last two pages in Hear Your Heart like How to Measure Your Heart Rate and How to Make a Stethoscope.<br /><br />There are several kids, adults and babies illustrated among the thirty-three pages of Hear Your Heart in various settings as well as illustrations of the heart in pink, red and black colors. The areas are identified to which is a vein and artery with other illustrations showing arrows in how the heart actually beats.<br /><br />Hear Your Heart begins with a girl at the Doctor's office showing a real stethoscope that is cold and making the girl shiver. She much prefers her homemade stethoscope made out of a cardboard tube. There are a few pages showing the girl and her sister listening to each other's heart and then other kids doing the same thing.<br /><br />Hear Your Heart is easy to follow written in a way that kids can understand and comprehend based on the detailed illustrations.  The style Hear Your Heart is written in offers all the answers that my child has along the way. This encourages my son to watch the second hand while he counts how many times his heart beats in one minute. There are times we learn like when exercising that the pace will be faster. Also noted is the ninety times a minute for an eight-year old. This is now a figure my son is striving to reach. A man's will be in the area of seventy-two while an infant is around one hundred twenty times a minute.<br /><br />My son is much more aware of his heart and pulse rate and wants to check everyone that he comes in contact with, including his teddy bear.

There are two distinctions for the captions above each student. If there are a few bubbles leading to the student this is a thought they are having that adds to the story. The squared captions located at each person, throughout the book is part of their dialogue. In reading the story to a child you can differentiate between these quite easily.<br /><br />Before any visitors show up Ms. Frizzle announces to her class that they were invited to a dinosaur dig. Some of the kids wondered what would happen to visitor's day if they just left but grabbed the toy dinosaurs and video camera on the way to the bus. \\" When you have the wackiest teacher in school, you need all the luck you can get!\\" Displayed on the pages are lists about fossils that were done by the students as they ride along the bus to the site.<br /><br />The bus drove through to the present time where they ended up back at the site where the paleontologists were worried about them. Ms. Frizzle gave them some advice on where to find fossils and they headed back to their classroom.

Wonder if his poop is still out there, now that I know what it looks like?<br /><br />The page my son breezed over shows a man with a pipe reading the paper, a boy sitting on a toilet, a boy on a duck potty and then the most realistic poop picture in the whole book, a baby sitting on the floor wailing with its legs in the air with its hands holding the legs and the poop sitting there in the diaper for me to see.<br /><br />I would quickly turn that page too. You see how kittens like to clean up after themselves and a rhino pays no attention to his poop. One of the last pages is a boy showing his duty in the toilet, two turds to be exact, and ready to flush it to the great beyond. The next two pages has animals eating in a line from the Giraffe to the boy at the table . Turn the page and there are the same animals lined up along with the boy and their duties left behind. And of course, the saying is Everyone Poops.<br /><br />My only regret is they do not show the boy putting on a pull up. But they did not have them in Japan in 1977 and the book was translated into English. This is a book for the kids who have yet to be toilet trained or are in the process. I think it is geared towards the age group of 3-5 and up for special needs kids.the age group of 3-5 and up for special needs kids. <br />	2004-11-06

Examples of longevity include taking classes at any age and working on a hobby or employment after retirement.  A body needs nutrients and water.  Most diseases stem from nutritional deficiencies and we need to train the body to eat healthy and exercise.  We become deficient in minerals that our bodies need.  We need to maintain the correct balance with knowledge and awareness to create energy and sustain life.<br /><br />A lot of the data comes from the author's years of public speaking on nutrition and health and is through research and schooling.  The message seems to be to learn more about how our bodies work and start treating it right.  Within the autism community many are administering supplements to their children and chelating heavy metals and using enzymes.  Living to 102 does not promote any diet but a lifestyle change to include herbs, exercise, fasting and proper nutrition along with daily exercise.  The author has achieved success by motivating others and sharing with her example and explanations.  After reading Living to 102 the reader will know more about their body than before.<br /><br />A chapter is devoted to the functions of the body like tears are a defense against disease, our bodies take in one pint of air with each breath, red blood cells grab up oxygen and get rid of waste, (carbon dioxide).  The idea is to take care of ourselves like we do our computers, cars and appliances and get checked out at the first sign of distress or illness.<br /><br />I did learn more about endometriosis and diabetes in the chapter that covered diseases.  The fasting and elimination chapters were of interest, but I know without a doubt that I would never fast, it is just not something I can consider or willing to at this time.<br /><br />There are several photos within the book showing the author and friends visiting the Garden of Gods in Colorado, Solvang, CA and at the ocean.  There is a lot of scripture within the chapters of Living to 102 that I glossed over since I am not a religious person.  Food processing and elimination are discussed in another chapter that explains the intestines and process.eral photos within the book showing the author and friends visiting the Garden of Gods in Colorado, Solvang, CA and at the ocean.

Little boys love bugs and this is the book to help them identify those creatures they come in contact with on a daily basis!  Learn the name of any bug you can imagine.<br /><br />To first understand the book you will find page two most helpful. This explains how the pages are set up. This is a puzzle book and many of the bugs are hidden in the pictures among the background of their surroundings in their daily life.<br /><br />When you open up the following pages there is a picture laid out in the two pages in the middle. The top, bottom and side borders have pictures with descriptions and facts on all the bugs. Some of the pages are horizontal and others are vertical.<br /><br />For each picture you will find approximately one hundred bugs. It is important to teach the youngster that you would not normally find that amount in the same spot. The Big Bug Search is an asset for the child who is learning to count, what a fun way to learn your numbers than by counting bugs! This is also similar to the types of homework we receive from the Kindergarten classroom with the searching for items that are hidden and hard to find.<br /><br />This search book series will provide countless hours of exploring, learning, counting and memorizing of every name listed in here for my son. I feel he will be having fun this summer as well as experimenting with the outside world of bugs, beetles and the like from the knowledge taken from The Big Bug Search .<br /><br />By looking through the pages with the pictures he has learned where to find certain spiders, what color trees some bugs like to hang out while others like the water scenery best.<br /><br />For the child who is a beginning reader this will be more of an interactive book with an Adult to read and help with the search of where each bug is lurking. With a magnifying glass a child can explore further. With this being a large paperback book you can use a pen or pencil to circle those that are of interest and answer the questions.

The following pages then show the Mama Cat washing her paws with the next double page showing Fluffy and Skinny doing the same, while on the opposite page Boris naps. Fluffy is the same coloring of the Mama cat with Skinny being brown and white. Boris is an orange cat that naps.<br /><br />While Mama Cat, Fluffy and Skinny sharpen their claws, chase leaves and walk along the stone wall, Boris naps. When the time comes for Mama Cat and Fluffy and Skinny to take a nap, Boris slowly awakens with stretches, yawns and cleaning his paws. While one page looks like Boris is about to pounce on flowers and start having some fun, he lands on Mama Cat, Fluffy and Skinny to nap some more.<br /><br />The picture shows Mama Cat, Fluffy and Skinny now with their eyes open curled around with Boris napping and eyes closed. It appears that Boris is a lazy cat and would rather stay put with his family than go off alone when he is awake. The pictures display the other kittens following the Mama Cat's lead but always in the background behind the bushes is Boris napping.<br /><br />This is an easy to follow book for a young child not yet a reader and enjoy the antics of the kittens. Also a good pick for a teacher to read to the classroom when studying pets. This would also make a good project at school for trying to make images in the same manner as the author.	2004-11-06

You can count all eight arms on one page and watch him eat a shrimp and crab on the next. It seems sharks like to eat Octopus but they are able to shoot out water to make their escape. At other times they shoot out black ink, faster than some can blink.<br /><br />In each illustration the Octopus Under The Sea is a different shaded Octopus. One is set in a grayish tone, another is speckled red and orange with another being green. The shape of them reminds me of a spider walking along with its legs. The places under the sea that an Octopus calls home are caves and holes below the ocean waves.<br /><br />The illustration of the black ink resembles a charcoal color and it seems like you could touch it and feel the heat. There are ways an Octopus can camouflage in the sea when someone dangerous approaches. The sea life is plentiful with purple starfish, red berries and greenery. It would be nice to know what the names are of these items under the sea because it is worth noting and learning.<br /><br />Octopus Under The Sea is an enjoyable read for my son who likes to stop and discuss what the Octopus is doing and predict what the next page will have or who will try to eat him. \\" An Octopus eats, hides, and flees in every one of Earth's blue seas.\\" This would serve as an introductory book on the Octopus and spark the discussion on sea life and how colorful it is down below. My son is very happy to be able to read Octopus Under The Sea on his own and share with his class as a reminder of their class trip.	2004-11-06

The classroom was equipped with pillows for each sloth as well as a place for slippers and robes. Adorning the walls are individual drawings of a chair that reclines, a bed and a pillow that made a B+. The schedule listed shows nothing for morning and afternoon with a chalkboard showing the counting of sheep.<br /><br />Sometimes the teacher would arise to instruct the class to yawn, roll over or to keep the snores coming. Through out the day the sloths were found in chairs sleeping, on the floor and on top of the desks. Lunch hour showed the most movement of the day when they had three lunch hours, \\" when the sloths would amble around the slotherteria taking a berry at a time, slowly chewing each one ever ... so... carefully.\\"<br /><br />Once lunch was over it was time for the sloths nap, then study hall and on to recess. Each of these activities shows them in various positions such as being slumped over a swing or on top of the swing set. During the study hall they each had a book opened and placed over their faces. Yes they had their faces in the books fast asleep with pencils still lying on the floor. These sloths were able to sleep in any position as their bodies were twisted in balls, sometimes with tails tucked underneath them.<br /><br />Although the bell rang daily at three these sloths did not leave willingly, but with a push from the janitor at six. Usually one would complain about a leg hurting and they argued over who would get up to get the door. This is what caused them to stick around till six each day. They were literally swept out the door and rolled home in their same positions of slumber.<br /><br />The sloths banded together in the end to save their school and Sparky fit right in. My son was not too interested in this book because it is only about sloths and they are too slow and old.

Located in the upper left-hand corner of each left- sided page is a large sized question mark in a blue shade.<br /><br />Some interesting questions to ponder along with an inquisitive child before prodding along through the book for the answers to those puzzling thoughts. It turns out that there are mountains and hills under the sea. Sea mounts are the correct term used for volcanoes under the sea.<br /><br />The illustrations in I wonder why the sea is salty and other questions about the ocean are in soft pastel shades nestled among three or four paragraphs relating to each question as it pertains to life under the sea.<br /><br />For anyone interested in learning more about sea life and its environment this is the perfect answer book for when you stumble on these questions through out childhood. The cover border consists of seashells with the index listing A-Z items. The table of contents covers the first two pages with illustrations mixed within.

What better time to read What Do Animals Do in Winter? than at the start of the season. Even though we reside in California and my son has not experienced snow this is still a good subject to explore. The first half of the book goes into detail on which animals hibernate and how they go about doing this. We learn they travel most usually south for the winter and return come spring. They come back the time things start to grow and the colors start to change plus the weather is getting warmer.<br /><br />This book gives great descriptions on how the animals combat the cold, where they travel to and how they change from the seasons. This would make a great addition for winter reading for kids that are interested in animals, nature and to learn about why animals behave certain ways. My son is a beginning reader and the pages are brief with short sentences on many for him to tackle in a topic he enjoys. This would also make a good gift for a teacher or to share with the classroom as a winter project.	2004-11-05

The illustrations are that of a boy and his parents visiting various places and in different settings. This makes sense to showcase since the passing of gas can happen anywhere and not restricted to private areas.<br /><br />The book begins with the boy and father getting flown to the ground due to the force of the fart that erupted from this huge Elephant, \\" BAAAROOMM\\". They were knocked on their butts with the boys' hat being removed from his head due to the force, since Elephant farts are really big.<br /><br />The illustrations are amusing, yet one page I found disturbing and not so much because the boy is standing up in the tub having his penis visible, but the fact that his father is also in the tub. Different cultures do things other ways so I am not sure if this is or was common back in Japan during the 1970s. The reason this illustration of the tub is shown in The Gas We Pass: The Story of Farts, has to do with what happens when you fart while in water. The bubbles rise with the boy looking behind him to see about five bubbles coming out of his rear moving toward the top of the water level. However the father is sitting in the back of the tub and his four bubbles look like they are coming from his stomach, so maybe he burped, although the text states, \\" People fart too,\\".<br /><br />There are lines around the father in many of the illustrations showing emotions of some kind, perhaps embarrassment from the noises his body emits. His parents each BURP! after the meal while the boy and a pet animal let loose with a fart. There is an illustrated adult body chart that shows the internal organs explaining the path of air and food.<br /><br />Another illustration shows the man holding his nose after cleaning up a rather stinky mess from a lion at the zoo. Every time we go to the zoo we see animals poop droppings waiting to be removed. Too bad the illustration of the lion makes him look not too happy after releasing his fart.<br /><br />This is a silly and educational book for kids to joke about and get comfortable asking questions while perusing the pages.rom a lion at the zoo.

Depending on the time of year, my son knows when the sun sets it is time to prepare for sleep, very much like the barnyard animals do in Going to Sleep on the Farm. The illustrations are so serene in style that I cannot help but yawn as I watch the little boy and his Father discuss how each animal goes to sleep.<br /><br />The back cover illustrates the twilight hour casting darkness over the farm with a lone owl on top of a fence post. In the distant it also seems cloudy this evening. My younger son seems to delight in observing the contrast to these two cover sides of Going to Sleep on the Farm. My son actually removed the pages of the book to expose what he liked best, after constantly pushing the pages back and forth until he came upon these two images beside one another.<br /><br />With each illustration of the boy and his father they are both in a more relaxed position. The father is dressed in what appears to be a brown velour shirt. At first he is reading a book while resting on the pillow that at times the boy lays his head or legs on as well.<br /><br />Reading Going to Sleep on the Farm has been a joy for us over the years as well as observing the way the vibrant illustrations have affected my children. I think most kids dream of living on a farm, even those who reside in the city. By watching the animals prepare for sleep it helps reinforce quiet time as the same happens in the home as on the farm. This gives the opportunity to see close up what the farm looks like in two descriptive settings.<br /><br />Going to Sleep on the Farm shows by example how a small box of barnyard animals and a fence can be used to enhance the wonders of a child into creating a story from their curious minds. As the boy puts away each of his animals he inquires as to how they go to sleep, which makes this a valuable lesson in teaching as a child is playing.	2004-11-05

(Scholastic Question & Answer)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Flies can walk upside down	A page has anywhere from two to four questions with the answers provided below and illustrations to enhance the readers' knowledge on that specific insect. The book is broken into a few sections, first Insect Ways, Growing Up and Insects you might meet. The very first question is How Do Flies Walk Upside Down? with the answer that they use their claws to grip rough spots. They explain that there is some sticky stuff covering their feet that makes it similar to walking with gum on your shoe sole.<br /><br />The illustrations showcase all the insects with their names beside them as well as documenting the four stages of metamorphosis. This is when certain insects change. Some insects do not pass through the four stages while others might grow wings. The insects you might meet would be butterflies, moths, ants and mosquitoes as well as flies. A butterfly will hold its wings straight up while a moth spreads its wings out flat.<br /><br />There are many questions inside How Do Flies Walk Upside Down? with interesting answers sure to amaze and interest any child with a curious mind. These books usually open up the discussion for more questions with more books to search for. This sparks the imagination and opens up the world of science and nature to my six-year old. He has become a walking encyclopedia on many animals and when we go outside he gets to see many of the same insects profiled inside the book. The illustrations show the insects up close and in their natural environment. There is one of a mosquito on skin as well as bees making honey. The colors are vivid and full of life showing all parts of the insects.	2004-11-05

My seven-year old after reading a few times What Mommies Do Best/What Daddies Do Best can now breeze through it so much so that I feel it is more rote reading than mastering reading fluency. This is a bit too easy for him, but I liked the book for showing how Mommies and Daddies can do the same things, if they are so inclined to do so. My son learned to pronounce Mommies and Daddies very clearly by continuing to read this book and he does not sound monotone now.<br /><br />My son also liked to go back and forth between sides to see how the other parent handled that particular page. The changing of the animals kept the imagination going and predicting which would next appear when he first started reading What Mommies Do Best/What Daddies Do Best. Each book consists of seventeen pages although they are not numbered.<br /><br />The section entitled, What Daddies Do Best starts off with the same text as What Mommies Do Best, with the only differences being the animals and illustrations to suit the gender. For example the Mommy was on a bicycle pedaling up the hill with the child behind on a smaller bike. When we get to What Daddies Do Best the Daddy is pushing the kid on the bike. Their cake is quite a masterpiece with them both donning the white bakers' hats with a four tiered cake decorated in pink and blue icing.<br /><br />This winning combination of author and illustrator shows how equally either parent can do something that still helps the child feel special and loved. They are different but the love for the child shines through in their role as parents in all that they do.<br /><br />For those that have spouses with a sense of humor this would be an ideal book for Father's Day, without letting on the other side is all about What Mommies Do Best. The reading level would be about five to seven with the interest for kids from toddlers through elementary age.	2004-11-05

I guessed that the teacher ordered extra books or was just cleaning out the room since she will be teaching another grade come this fall.<br /><br />Whatever the reason we read the book two times and I discovered it the other day under my son's bed ripped in the middle throughout the book. It seems my son is not fond of the book either and did not want to endure another read from me on this one.<br /><br />It seems Mrs. McNosh likes to hang up whatever she can find and within sight including the turkey she is roasting for dinner. Every Monday by dusk she is finished with this chore and takes off her apron, lets her hair down and hangs herself up on the clothesline while sitting in a chair.<br /><br />It takes Mrs. McNosh all morning to get her laundry washed and she hangs it up when the sun is out.

On page 24 they go into detail on melanin, which is grains of color to protect the body from the sun. He states that Mark's skin makes a lot of this while Henry and Mary's skin does not. There is no explanation on how he knows this or why it is different.<br /><br />He has freckles on his skin and in the summer his skin does not make enough of melanin so he needs to rub on lotion. It is explained that darker skin can get burned by the sun so all should wear sunscreen. Mary and Henry have light brown skin and Mark has dark brown. This boy with freckles is the only one to have white skin.<br /><br />This little boy and his sister helped their Mother clean the attic while wearing their bathing suits. This seemed funny to my son and he wondered why the boy was not wearing a shirt and the girl almost knocked over a lamp while chasing a spider with the broom. It must have been summer time since the siblings went outside to hose off the dirt from cleaning. He said his Mother thought this was easier than washing more dirty clothes. This is one idea I wish that was not in the book, as my son will want to do this as well. The last page has the kids cooling off with lemonade explaining how they were cool on the inside and out.<br /><br />My son did not agree with the toenails and hair cuts not hurting, he did not learn why his fingers get wrinkled and funny looking after taking a bath. Just the past two days we had a new worker in our house and he was full of questions for her as her skin is darker than ours. He wanted to know why her feet were dark, her hair was another shade, how she did the braids and what happened to her nails since they were red. Then he wanted to know about the things in her ears and if they hurt. I still have a need for a book that will help explain differences to my son as this did not really touch upon that aspect. Your Skin and Mine is a nice book but goes off in directions that are of no interest for us at this present time.

It is never mentioned where exactly this class trip is and hard to tell by the way they are dressed. What is portrayed is how much fun it would be to be the train that takes the kids on the school trip. Before they depart the trains, known as Henry, Thomas and James are scrubbed so their engines are shiny and bright. \\" The train yard is ready.\\"<br /><br />Thomas the Tank Engine is all excited when the children arrive wanting them to see him push and pull. But it turns out that Thomas the Tank Engine has work to do on his regular branch line, which makes him sad as he would rather have fun taking the children on their school trip. \\" Sir Topham Hat has an idea. Do your job, Thomas. Then hurry back. You can take the children home.\\" This sets the train in motion to rush about his regular routine just so he can take the kids home. What this shows in my opinion is Thomas the Tank Engine slacking off on his duties just so he can have fun. This is not a good message for my son to learn at this point in time.<br /><br />Instead of the happy Thomas the Tank Engine content on his rides he is sad and thinking of hurrying back for the kids instead of focusing on the task at hand and gets upset when he has to wait for his loads and obstacles along the route. His face is red as he is riding up a hill and over a bridge and then through a tunnel. All the while the coaches Annie and Clarabel are reminding him to hurry back so they can take the children home. If they are late another train will do the job. Up ahead Thomas sees Bertie the Bus broken down, but first he ponders whether he should stop and help or continue on hurrying to get to the station before another train to take the kids home.<br /><br />My son was able to read through Thomas the Tank Engine and the School Trip several times, but it was boring for him since he knew the ending. He also had many questions like where the kids were going on the trip and why they were all dressed in the same clothes. The last page is a green background that makes the text hard to read for my son also. He also wanted to know about what age the kids were on the school trip. It was hard to tell but they appear to be older like ten to thirteen perhaps.<br /><br />For kids who are fans of Thomas the Tank Engine they will like the book.

There are A-Z stickers included.  These truck stickers list the kind of truck it is to help guide the reader to placing them on the correct spot.<br /><br />The first two pages open up to the town of Elwood with various vehicles driving about as we follow Arthur's family setting out on their vacation. Arthur and his sister D.W. are waving out the windows in their blue car that has baggage on the top rack. They are passing by a construction site on the right with a house ablaze as a firefighter is on the ladder with what appears to be a tool to break the window to the room where the fire is coming from.

No adults are present on these pages and no evidence of any of the friends showing money to pay for any of the items. The book does not flow very well since we start out on a vacation with the kids in the back seat of the car and then the friends are in other pages of Arthur's Truck Adventure.<br /><br />What would seem like a book geared toward sparking the imagination of a child instead offers bad choices in the examples. The theme is not followed through the story of Arthur's Truck Adventure and children are allowed to do as they please with no supervision.

This is accurately illustrated with the sponge acrylic brushings in the background adding to the softness of the pages. The reader feels the closeness of the bears when viewing their position as well as noticing the loving look in the eyes of Mother Bear.<br /><br />The snow was falling outside the first evening they tried to settle into the cave where they would sleep for many months. Baby Bear was uncomfortable in these surroundings having always slept under the sky. It seems that Baby Bear wanted to continue with his customary snack before bed even though there were no snacks to be found in the cave.<br /><br />Mother Bear made the journey outside into the snow to a nearby tree for an apple. Before Baby Bear even finished the apple Mother Bear was fast asleep. Baby Bear tossed and turned trying to get into a comfortable sleeping position, but nothing worked. With a poke to Mother Bear who managed to open one eye to hear the request for a drink from Baby Bear.<br /><br />My seven year-old enjoyed reading Good Night, Baby Bear and wonders each and every time what will happen to the snow once it has melted. I like to show my son the similarity between the Baby Bear and his nightly requests for water.

The sun is breaking behind them as they trot with eagerness enjoying the air. It first looks like the boy has red skinned knees, but the way the illustrations of the boy blend in with nature it is hard to really tell.<br /><br />This happens to be a journey exploring nature with this boy and dog as the pages reflect the scenery changing, as well as the weather with the boy removing his socks and shoes at one point along with his shirt. The second set of pages has the boy leaping for joy with his arms outstretched among the mountains to the left.<br /><br />This illustration looks like leaves are on his shirt, as he becomes one in nature in what started as a white shirt. My son says it was a pretty good book but he wanted to know the name of the boy and his dog. This is a Scholastic book authored by Michael DeMunn, who is a prominent conservationist, with the illustrations by Jim McMullan, a celebrated artist. This would make a wonderful addition to a classroom that has a study on nature or earth to have kids take turns reading the pages and discuss the surroundings on these pages. The theme is that all is good with nature setting positive settings to appreciate the earth and all its gifts, as they are seen through the eyes of the boy with the illustrations. The boy and his dog enjoy a carefree day that is worth reading for budding nature lovers. The age range could easily fit from three to eight and handy for when Earth Day rolls around next year.	2004-11-05

They should not take the actions of the kitten seriously. The book appears to be capturing a kitten let loose in a house amidst the Christmas tree and decorations. It is very cute but a warning should go with every reading of this book as it shows the kitten climbing the tree as well as climbing a top of the mantle while a fire is ablaze. I am also uncomfortable seeing a kitten wearing a ribbon as this could be tangled around the neck or stuck on an item.<br /><br />There are also three stockings over the mantle while the fire is glowing with some ornament balls on top of the mantle. It certainly looks like the kitten went from the chair to the mantle. The reader is not sure if it is the balls on the mantle that is interesting to the kitten or just the climbing part that is fun. Well the kitten then gets wrapped up in a few ribbon rolls of red and green while a bone toy sits next to them. It is hard to describe the look on the face of this kitten in this illustration as it clearly does not look to be enjoying this.<br /><br />Please use your own judgement and decide if this book is suitable for your family or just pass it by.	2004-11-05

A group of fossil hunters ride along in a jeep in search of fossils of birds from dinosaur times. When they first started looking around they found some rocks about the size of a grapefruit. Upon further inspection these turned out to be dinosaur eggs. \\" For fossil hunters, this was like striking gold. Some of these eggs still had baby dinosaurs inside them!\\" Because these babies had never hatched they turned into fossils, and some even had skin.<br /><br />The illustrations show the progression of the eggs with the skulls and bones inside.  The illustrations are vibrant with the eyes on these dinosaurs looking mean while others scurried away. The scientists discovered that the grown-up titanosaurs had bony plates in their skin, similar to a crocodile, while the baby dinosaurs did not have these.<br /><br />Through out the story of these fossil hunters in Dinosaur Eggs are questions for children to ponder and explore further within the pages. \\" So, why didn't these babies hatch? What happened at the nesting ground?\\" This sparks the imagination in my son and offers him the chance to respond when reading along with various thoughts and ideas.<br /><br />The series is entitled, All Aboard Reading, this being a level two book. The level two has a smaller text than the previous level with the sentences broken down in an easy to read fashion.<br /><br />For any dinosaur enthusiast this would be worth the purchase so they can master the art of reading on an interesting subject. Each page covers roughly one or two sentences along with the illustrations that were prepared by Pamela Johnson. The fossil hunters are shown in the early pages with the bulk of the illustrations being the background settings with the dinosaurs.	2004-11-05

For anyone living in Florida this is an awesome sight to take in as well as listening as the shuttle orbits. There are times when landings must take place in California when Florida is having severe weather problems and this is worth observing as well.<br /><br />You're Aboard Spaceship Earth shares how everyone must do their part to keep the Earth clean and green and show how we never run out of these vital supplies for our ride along space while living here on Earth. We learn the importance of air, water, plants and animals along with the oxygen we breathe. This also presents other aspects of recycling that children might not of been aware just yet. This would be of interest to any child that has shown an interest in space and what is needed to function while on a shuttle. The examples show how You're Aboard Spaceship Earth is very similar to being in a shuttle with all the same vitals needed to stay healthy and alive.<br /><br />The illustrations offer both male and female examples with the age suited from five to eight for kids in the primary grades benefiting from this Stage 2 book that includes hands on activities and thoughts to ponder and explore soil and gardens in their own yards. My son was interested in reading You're Aboard Spaceship Earth a few times before moving onto another book. Any child that enjoys science and how the world works will find this book useful.	2004-11-05

Each of The Teletubbies heard this but were not sure what exactly it was. They have their hands over their ears due to the level of noise with three rabbits hopping along the grass. There were three clouds up in the sky overhead in various shapes and sizes. Po was the first to use this magic drum and make his own pom pom pom racket.<br /><br />Each flapped page shows another Teletubbie using The Magic Drum with the background still being the clouds, rabbits and other Teletubbies. Once Po started banging on the drum they noticed the clouds changed places. When Tinky Winky started banging pom pom pom on The Magic Drum the rabbits changed places. It seemed that the rabbits were going around the drum in a circular motion. Each of The Teletubbies repeated the same phrase for the clouds and rabbits changing places.<br /><br />This is a silly board book that is durable with the pages easy to wipe clean. The back cover shows a page from The Magic Drum as well as a small picture of The Teletubbies reading books. The Magic Drum would be suitable for toddlers through pre-school aged children and especially those who are fans of The Teletubbies.<br /><br />I actually had a hard time in deciphering how you could tell the rabbits had changed places since they all look alike, where with the clouds and The Teletubbies it is more noticeable. The Magic Drum is white on top and the sides show stars and circles in red, orange, green and blue. There is only one hammer to bang on The Magic Drum.<br /><br />My children seemed to enjoy The Magic Drum for a few days until it got tossed in the bottomless book collection.	2004-11-05

There are several pages that have arrows pointing from one item to another and it gets confusing trying to sort it all out.<br /><br />We begin with seeing a caterpillar eating a leaf on an apple tree until he becomes the dinner of the arriving wren. When a hawk comes around he eats the wren. In this example the food chain begins with the leaf and ends with the hawk. It is described how the animal at the top of the food chain is the last eater because it is the one no one else will eat.<br /><br />There are other short chains like when you eat an apple off a tree or drink milk in a glass. The cow eats the grass and the milk comes from the cow. There is a detailed diagram with a girl eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, an apple and a glass of milk. Food keeps us alive and animals need to catch the food they need to survive. First we begin with green plants, as they are the only living things that can make their own food and do not need to eat something else. Animals depend on green plants as well.<br /><br />During the summer months Antartica comes alive with tiny green plants that are eaten by krill. The squid will in turn eat the krill, which looks like shrimp. The killer whale can eat a sperm whale or a blue whale.<br /><br />When you change your eating patterns you are changing the food chain as well. Fishermen kill krill but they cannot kill them all since this is what happened when they almost wiped out the sea otters in the Pacific Sea. It is important to take care of the earth so all living things have something to eat and in turn we help them and ourselves in the process.	2004-11-05

The book consists of 176 pages of these ideas with seven to ten on each page with many being similar and pretty basic in concept. There are some tips that are used for more than one room, so when another room is discussed this tip is presented again with examples.<br /><br />I think if someone stopped and tried to come up with ideas for how to organize their house they would easily have the format for this book, because it read like many thoughts jotted down in sentence form.<br /><br />Many of the tips make sense and may be overlooked when trying to tackle the task of uncluttering years worth of collections and junk. Finish one room before attempting another, for every new item brought into the home toss out five items, plan activities around garbage day.<br /><br />There are a few tips and recommendations that I did not agree with or really understand the need. When going through your home to decipher what is clutter, think in terms that each item is sacrificing space. The question to ponder is do you want the space for this clutter or for breathing space. The tips are presented with suggestions, but I did not get the sense that the author has done all these steps due to the lack of personalization to these ideas.<br /><br />Unclutter your home: 7 Simple Steps, 700 Tips & Ideas is a quick read, good for someone who might need a push in this direction and certainly a wise investment for someone to kick in their new year resolution come holiday time.

I purchased this book at the event for roughly ten dollars. It consists of one hundred thirty-one pages broken into sixteen chapters as well as an index and appendix.<br /><br />Autism Treatment Guide has an outline on Autism Defined and Diagnosis that discusses the tools used to observe the child and make the diagnosis. These include the CHAT (Checklist for Autism in Toddlers), Form E-2 from ARI (Autism Research Institute) and the DSM-IV, which is the American Psychiatric Association's Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.<br /><br />The CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) is not mentioned, which is what I used when diagnosing my second son while observing behaviors not presented by the older son already diagnosed. As stated in Autism Treatment Guide, \\" Autism is treatable. Autism is behaviorally defined.\\" This section gives an overview of PDD and PDD-NOS. This simply means Pervasive Development Disorder - Not otherwise specified. There are children that fall into this category and it depends on the score on the particular tests to see where the child fits in the spectrum.<br /><br />The resources offer a wide range of where to obtain these services and therapies. There is no personal experience offered in way of what the author has achieved with her own son within these treatments. In my opinion this is a good resource book to start with but certainly there are other aspects to these treatments and discussing with other parents before attempting any of these is the right step to make.<br /><br />The resources are national and might not be available in your area and there is no section that mentions how to get these funded and what options to choose and how to get second opinions, etc. There are theories explored that mention some researchers but no idea of what organizations found this data.ed that mention some researchers but no idea of what organizations found this data.	2004-10-21

I think every parent that has a child with special needs would hope that friendship and acceptance would come as quickly to them as it does to Timmy in What's Wrong With Timmy?<br /><br />The story begins with Kate and her mother at the park. Kate is always so full of questions and wonders why the boy she observes playing basketball seems different. Kate learns his name is Timmy from her Mom who happened to be friends with his Mother before they moved away when both kids were babies. When Kate asked her Mother about Timmy her Mother proceeded to speak in the same way as when she has something important to say.<br /><br />It turns out that Timmy is a child with special needs. He talks slower, cannot walk or run as fast as Kate but he wants the same things as other children do. Kate kept asking her Mother more questions indicating that she was scared of Timmy because of his differences. Her Mother explained that when we first come in contact with someone different we may feel uncomfortable and that is okay. She than relays in detail about a friend of hers when she was in school who had a sister that was in a wheelchair. To this day Kate's Mother cannot recall if she ever said hello to Rosie the first time she met her when playing with Tina. Kate says that back in those days people were in institutions or just stayed in their homes.<br /><br />I am not sure how many typical developing children are as inquisitive as Kate, but find all her questions and feelings quite fascinating. As a parent to two special needs children it is hard to know how other children view those who have disabilities and are different.<br /><br />This is certainly a story that can be read to children before they enter the school system and learn about all types of children they will encounter. We should be encouraging all children not to fear another child because they are different but to seek out the similarities within	2004-10-21

David knows everything about his brother, but he does get frustrated at times when he walks slower or talks funny. Matthew was born with disabilities that required him to remain in the hospital with tubes and wires connected to machines. The parents were at the hospital all the time leaving David with his grandmother to do puzzles. He was not happy being in the dark about his brother and it all materialized for him when he was allowed to view his brother through the window. This was a confusing time for David because no one had any answers to why his brother could not eat or breathe the way other babies could.<br /><br />Within the pages of My Brother, Matthew it looks like the boys are two to three years apart since they are older and close in size. The book jumps in time quite a bit from Matthew being just a baby to an elementary school aged child. I am not sure how effective it is to gloss over so much time, but the illustrations are very engaging. The boys have light skin with blonde hair and for many of the pages are wearing the same clothing.<br /><br />My Brother, Matthew shows the impact a disabled child has on the other sibling in the family and follows along with the development of their relationship. Instead of instant bonding one would find in a movie of the week, the gradual process is believable by going through the process of loneliness, jealousy, frustration and acceptance.	2004-10-21

Charts are organized with the student's name, person trained and position in the top left corner. The columns allow for six dates to be entered under the following headings, Name and Procedure, Preparation, Identifies Supplies and Procedure. Located within these sections are numbered specifics anywhere from five to twenty. Many of the lists are two pages with the final line for the parent or guardian to sign and date.<br /><br />My main purpose in borrowing Children and Youth Assisted by Medical Technology in Education Settings: Guidelines for Care was to learn the correct terminology for the variations used in tube feeding along with the precautions and tools needed. There are diagrams that show the placements of the tubes as well as the pump, feeding bag, syringe and clamp.<br /><br />Also listed are points to remember, observations and possible problems that require immediate attention and those that are non emergencies. There are step by step guides on how to change tubes, along with the clean up of the area and how to dispose of tools and waste. The pages with explanations have these listed in italic font.<br /><br />The details and diagrams help to grasp the enormity of this decision while explaining how the education system handles students with special health care needs.

Since writing another book on her autistic children, the editor Catherine Maurice received so many calls from parents inquiring on behavioral programs and combining them with the countless types of therapies that families are trying to incorporate. She refers to the countless breakthrough treatments that parents flock to in order to cure the autism their child has. She feels that unless you can provide concrete scientific research to support said statements no one is really an authority on autism. There are an alarming number of professionals and parents that have come to rely on educators and therapists and they may not have all the facts, yet we rely on them to have the answers for our children.<br /><br />The last chapters are personal stories, about the authors and the index. This was co-edited by Gina Green & Stephen C. Luce. I had the preschool teacher several years ago make copies of Chapter five and incorporate them in her program. The curriculum guide was in a beginner, intermediate and advanced sections broken down into various skills.<br /><br />There is also a flow-chart that explains the system for behavior modification and the steps to go through depending on yes or no responses. At the end of each chapter lists conclusions, acknowledgements and references accordingly. Throughout the book are examples of steps or exercises to use and tables with the tasks being broken step by step.<br /><br />This manual should be in the home of every parent who has an autistic child, those that teach children should have a copy in the classroom as well as therapists, doctors, nutritionists and other professionals that come into contact with the special needs community.	2004-10-21

The book consists of thirty-two pages sharing discussions between a girl named Kate and her mother. The mother is very sad one day and explains to Kate that grandma died. Kate is full of questions that the author's own daughter had asked.<br /><br />On each page the pastel illustrations portray the scenes described on that particular page. Sandra Speidel has won awards for her previous pastel illustrations in children's books. The first picture shows a girl sitting among the flower pots with her mother sharing a special moment, possibly reflecting on the life of the loved one who just passed away. Next Kate asks about Angels and the illustration shows an Angel sailing through the sky.<br /><br />Kate learned that each member of her family carries a piece of the relatives that are in Heaven and she was taught to believe in herself. Kate went outside to play and glanced up at the sky leaving a message for her great-grandmother, \\" your spirit will always be alive in me\\".<br /><br />I was pleased with the way this book handled the questions young children might ask at a time when a loved one dies. I felt this was suitable for any faith, as this did not delve into any certain religious practices. I would think this would be a good book for a Sunday school class to read as well as for children over the age of four or five in a pre-school setting and regular classrooms.<br /><br />I would certainly get this book when the time is right and the subject needs to be addressed. It would be worth having on staff in the Hospital for families to read when someone passes on, especially in the Children's ward. With more families having their elderly relatives living with them, this is a subject that might need to be addressed.

She can recall names of teachers and actual events that took place from the time she was a small child. There are many references to the similarities of cows in the slaughtering houses she designs and works at to the way an autistic persons mind works.<br /><br />Temple discusses how many parents are looking for a magic cure thinking their child has to have ten hours of intensive therapies. She cites that there are studies showing that twenty to twenty-five hours a week requiring the child to constantly interact with their teacher was most effective. Her own mother spent thirty minutes a day reading to her and Temple says that a neurologist gave her mother the best advice to follow her own instincts.<br /><br />It should be noted that Temple is in her fifties and things that took place during her childhood are not happening in this day. Back then children were placed in institutions. Most of the issues Temple refers to she gives scientific background and then her personal history on how she has progressed through the years. For example she explains that most autistic people do not realize that their sensory processing is different. The reader learns of her medication intake and how this has developed over time.<br /><br />Temple is a lecturer on autism to professionals and parents and recounts many meetings she has had and the exact conversations as well. Temple designed a squeeze machine that was the result of studying the behavior of the cows during their walk through in the slaughter houses. Temple has always hated to be hugged, saying it triggered something in the nervous system. Many autistic children do crave deep pressure stimulation even though they cannot tolerate it .<br /><br />I do advise any relative of an autistic person read this extraordinary look at life from the perspective of one with the disability.f the cows during their walk through in the slaughter houses.

It was not until page 58 that the reader learns that Donna lived in Australia, now residing in England. I was wondering why there were so many Italian families in the 1970s when reading Nobody Nowhere!<br /><br />The way Donna saw things was bit by bit, a string of pieces strung together. Donna got her first job at the age of fifteen, sorting goods in a department store. Donna got a goat from a service station when she was twenty-one, naming it after her late grandfather.<br /><br />For years Donna slept with her eyes open and her dreams would come true years later. Donna had brothers older and younger than her and a Mother that abused her, calling her a drug addict and slut. Donna was three people, Carol, Willie and Donna. She would escape into the characters and felt it was okay to feel only three years old.<br /><br />It was confusing at times since Willie and Carol are described as personalities. Donna saw Mary from the Psychiatric outpatient department for several years, who thought Donna was Schizophrenic. As Donna explained, \\"Carol was always sent out to test the waters before Donna decided it was safe to jump in.\\"<br /><br />Donna referred back to friends she met throughout the book and moved every two months since it felt like two years to her. She had many male friends as well as female friends that came and went.<br /><br />Nobody Nowhere does not touch upon the Special Education Laws or assessments that I have experienced with my two autistic children. Since her diagnosis was later in life that aspect of the disability is not mentioned since she did not experience it.<br /><br />This was an interesting account of Donna's life and how she dealt with the outside world and intertwined her three personalities to cope. I feel this is a worthwhile read for any parent or relative of an autistic person. Teachers and psychologists as well as therapists would better understand how an autistic person sees themselves.ts would better understand how an autistic person sees themselves.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-21

Each phase has three sections, The environment, the training steps and helpful hints.<br /><br />Phase I - The physical exchange,Phase II - Expanding Spontaneity<br /><br />Phase III - Picture Discrimination, Phase IV - Sentence Structure, Phase V - Responding to \\"What do you want?\\", Phase VI - Responsive and Spontaneous Commenting<br /><br />PECS was first developed for use with preschool children with autism that had little or no speech.  For the first phase there needs to be a reinforcer assessment. This means picking five to eight edibles that the child/student likes. The items preferred would be picked within five seconds. For those items that were picked at least three times remove them and conduct assessment with remaining items. This continues until a pool of three to five preferred items have been determined.<br /><br />There are diagrams explaining how this system works. The process starts as backward chaining with the trainers delaying the verbal praise until the student has released the picture into the open hand of the trainer. The helpful hints in this first phase discuss finding the right symbol system.<br /><br />Some will use black and white line drawings or product logos. Then the size of the photo is determined, usually two-inch. The trainer should wear a apron or waist pack to keep the pictures in and purchase lots of velcro!<br /><br />Phase II has the trainer moving further away from the student and have the student remove the card from the board and hand to the trainer. The trainer can get up to make the student than have to stand up to hand the card. Verbal praise is continued with reinforcement while the exchange is in motion. A helpful hint is now to have a three-ring binder for the cards, as you move to more pictures.<br /><br />A diagram in the book shows how this process is done in an easy to understand format. Picture-take picture to materials-materials (no interruptions)-take materials to work area (no interruptions)-activity(no interruptions)-get reward-finish activity-get reward-put materials away-take picture-go back to schedule.Picture-take picture to materials-materials (no interruptions)-take materials to work area (no interruptions)-activity(no interruptions)-get reward-finish activity-get reward-put materials away-take picture-go back to schedule. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-21

The only mention is on the back cover, \\" Sammy is autistic, and in this wonderful book two brothers find out how to really love each other.\\" The cover design is consistent with how the pages are illustrated with the flowing brushed watercolor theme.<br /><br />I cried after reading My Brother Sammy the first time and still get emotional when I peruse through the pages. My seven-year old thought the kids had orange faces and did not like some of the illustrations, especially when Sammy was angry.<br /><br />The illustrations of Sammy blended with the background, making it seem as if he was part of the scenery at times. I believe this was done to show how autistic children tend to drift away from crowds, preferring to stay in their own world.<br /><br />The story begins with the narration of the older brother offering insight to the differences between his day and his brother Sammy. Within each example the explanation is the same, \\" My mom says it's because he's special.\\"<br /><br />The text on the page of Sammy nestled in the leaves of the trees' mentions how embarrassed his brother is for he wishes Sammy would just join in his games. The following page really captures the intent look on Sammy's face as he watches sand pour out from his hands while in the sandbox. His older brother is building castles and tunnels wishing Sammy would build creations with him instead.<br /><br />Sammy repeats whatever his brother says to him so he will say \\" Hello, Sammy\\" right back to him without knowing any other way. Just like the book Ian's Walk the sibling finally seems to understand autism and enters the world of the autistic sibling.<br /><br />At times while reading through My Brother Sammy I felt the collages of color were distracting as did my son. I would have rather had less emphasis on the special aspect of being different and more on what exactly is autism with some of the symptoms and how they fit into the world Sammy lives in. It certainly seems to be catching on to the siblings of autistic children that in order to converse with the sibling you need to get to their level, instead of trying to draw them out and force them into a world they cannot adjust to.f the symptoms and how they fit into the world Sammy lives in.

Joey than quickly calls out Mommy to come get Sam so he can get some sleep. Sam has started his ritualistic behaviors by waving his hands in the air, walking on his toes and making sounds that Joey could not understand. \\"Why can't he be like other brothers?\\" asked Joey. \\"Why is he different?\\"<br /><br />To me it reads like Joey cannot accept his brother until his friends do and that goes against what was previously stated from the Epilogue. Nowhere in the text did either parent help Joey with his feelings for his brother and there was no compassion shown in the home privately.<br /><br />I liked the premise of Joey and Sam: A Heartwarming storybook about Autism, a family and a brother's love but the brother who showed what love really is would have to be Sam. The book fell short in these areas of compassion and dealing with the family unit. The parents were more of a back drop with Sam having the big heart living happily in his own world while his brother was in denial earlier on. Joey cared more about what his friends thought.<br /><br />It was such a contrast going from what the classroom for Sam was like and then Joey focusing on the quiet of his class or the fact that he ate lunch with his friends and had recess with them. I liked the way the therapists and teachers were involved with the children in the autism class. Another complaint would be how the classmates for Joey were considered friends but for Sam they were just classmates. In the end Sam is a very happy and content kid going about his routines while Joey focuses on his friends and frets about having a brother like Sam.<br /><br />I still recommend this book for families as a whole to read but not to place too much emphasis on the story line for siblings to autistic children. The illustrations would warrant five stars as well as the portrayal of autistic behavior and the positive role of the classroom teachers and assistants.ive role of the classroom teachers and assistants.  <br />   <br />	2004-10-21

The author, Daniel Mont, shares his frustrations along with observations as the primary caregiver to Alex, his first born son. While his wife Nannette was working outside the home the first few years, Daniel was spending hours reading books to Alex.<br /><br />When Daniel got a teaching position at Cornell they moved to upstate New York with Nannette taking over the daily duties pertaining to Alex. They noticed that Alex did not take any interest in other children when at the playground and had difficulty at the store. Since this was their first child when Simon was born a few years later they realized with regret how much slower Alex was with milestones and the lack of social skills.<br /><br />Daniel shares the relief once the diagnosis was made and the steps taken to get there, including the time a preschool teacher accused them of being abusive parents. There are a few choice words at this point in the book when Daniel incites the rage he was feeling from this attack and how he and Nannette focused on getting some assistance with Alex instead of getting on the defensive. For most families that have a child on the autism spectrum this is a predicament that happens often, and due to the lack of awareness for those who work with small children. Many of his colleagues and family members thought they were spoiling Alex, but later they learned how additional measures need to be put in place to help the autistic child fit in with society and how things work.<br /><br />Daniel wrote about growing up with a sister who had a disability, but never received a formal diagnosis for her handicap. When Alex was diagnosed Daniel was able to reach out to his mother and learn from her experience. Alex received speech therapy early on with the therapist assisting him in social situations, guiding him in the art of the conversation and how to relate to others.<br /><br />There is no mention about vaccinations or questioning why Alex is the way he is. Time is spent trying to get inside the world of Alex and how he thinks. The book is written in a style that is easy to comprehend for anyone who lacks information on autism. Daniel mentions a few books that helped him early on and how he joined some internet groups and the guidance he received from adults with autism. The family accepted autism and made adjustments to accommodate Alex so that he could thrive being himself. Daniel and his family grew up in New Jersey, which is where I was raised as well and have a sibling with a disability.<br /><br />A Different Kind of Boy: A Father's Memoir About Raising a Gifted Child with Autism covers the time from when Alex was born to fifth grade. At this point in time Daniel is picturing life when his sons have moved on to college and their own lives. This was something he was not sure would happen, but now he believes that Alex will have success in life. Family relationships are mentioned and how they handled the loss of Daniel's mother.<br /><br />I felt the second half flowed smoother than the first. The beginning chapters I had to go back and see what age Alex was at the time since I was confused with the timeframe, due to chapters being out of sequence. Every so often when reading a chapter the author would refer back to his childhood or a few years back with either Alex or Simon.<br /><br />The author does not gloss over any issues and gives honest feedback on how he felt at pivotal times in his life and the anxiety about school, plus finding friends for Alex. He finished this book after his mother passed on and pursued his acting career further.<br /><br />This book is perfectly suited for anyone who wants to know more about living with a child who is autistic and would be beneficial to family members who have someone on the spectrum and may live out of town or in another state. This will help parents know what struggles other families have gone through and give guidance on how to navigate the system to enable your child to thrive in their surroundings.who have someone on the spectrum and may live out of town or in another state.

That book is about a neighborhood girl with autism who goes to a special school. The author of that series, Ann Martin, mentioned at the back of the book that she had some personal experience with autistic kids and this is how she was able to discuss the topic in a book. It was also noted that before she created The Baby-Sitters Club series she wrote an earlier book entitled, Inside Out, also on the subject of a child with autism.<br /><br />Inside Out is written in the third person via an eleven-year old boy named Jonathan. He has a younger brother, James who at four years of age has autism and keeps the family up nightly with his screaming. Lizzie is the other sibling at eight years of age. There are nineteen chapters covering 152 pages for young readers and those adults interested in learning how autism affects an older sibling along with his friends on a daily basis. Comparing the two books by this same author I felt more connected with the characters in Inside Out. I preferred the writing style and felt it was an easier read.<br /><br />I was interested in the activities Jonathan and his friends pursued, the relationships between siblings and parents and how everyone handled their stress. It was very enlightening as a parent to boys to learn about behaviors and coping mechanisms, things I can relate to more than the other book centering on girls who offer babysitting services.<br /><br />A shopping trip with James was a nightmare and they tried to have someone home watching him so no one had to endure a scene. Once when Jonathan came home from school his Mother was crying after such a trip.<br /><br />There are conversations between Lizzie and Jonathan about their parents and they assume that their Dad works late so he can avoid James. They clean the house and prepare dinner often so their Mom can take a nap after a rough night being up with James. They always talk about James in front of him as if he were not there. There are times that James acts like a wild animal and scares the family.<br /><br />Inside Out shows the compassion for another sibling and the bonds that are formed when the family takes part in the therapies and schooling of the special child. This offers a glimpse into the family dynamics with an autistic child. The characters were developed and realistic.

There are thirteen chapters, covering February through February with the chapters actually covering a specific month.<br /><br />The acknowledgments went on for three pages, thanking everyone he could possibly think of! The introduction gives a recap on his \\"pseudo celebrity\\", appearing on the Oprah show and the chance meeting on an airplane that led to the writing of the book. The afterword covers the period from The Bachelorette to The Bachelor and explains the airplane meeting.<br /><br />In the middle is a nine page black and white spread showcasing baby photos through college football days. I would have rather had photos from the television series, like behind the scenes. If your intent on reading this self indulging book is to learn tidbits from either show you will be sorely disappointed. The only insight I learned is that there were seventy pages of questions to answer for the television show. Not one example was shared for the reading audience. He had literally only three weeks from the time he learned he was chosen as a Bachelor to appear on The Bachelorette for taping. As a viewer of the show I would have preferred learning more about how he prepared and what he was allowed to pack for the trip.<br /><br />The marriage did not last three years, yet Bob was devastated at the breakup. Jennifer left him in a bizarre way, leaving a post it note behind with her intentions on ending the marriage. Bob was a partner in a mortgage business, which he did not discuss while on The Bachelorette. He writes that he is just the average guy next door that will mow your lawn. It came as a surprise to the other men on the show that Bob was in a band and had played college football.<br /><br />He only briefly mentioned The Oprah Show. I feel that show is what made him more popular and she was the one he had consulted before agreeing to be The Bachelor. It was evident when reading that Bob was not really interested in starting a relationship with Trista while he was on The Bachelorette since he was still mending his broken heart.<br /><br />The best part of reading through this book was getting to the end.fore agreeing to be The Bachelor.

Chapter 2 does break down how a cat should look before you bring it home and advises to have a vet look it over. This did not cover pet stores though.  This should be done between 6-8 weeks. The domestic shorthair kitten will have a moist nose, bright eyes and shiny fur.<br /><br />MY CAT: How to Have a Happy, Healthy Pet is a great book, each chapter covers from 2-3 pages in an easy to read format for a child with accompanying photos and pictures to grasp the information. My son is nine, high functioning autism and loved learning about cats since he has an interest in a neighbor's cat.<br /><br />There is no age recommendation, but I would estimate from K-5th graders would gain insight into obtaining a cat or kitten.

This is not the case as the illustrations by Bob Tore are black and white. Although this was a disappointment at first, I think it draws the readers away from distractions so they can focus on the situation presented on each page.<br /><br />There are four choices for each dilemma with no set answers, meant for discussion.  Encourages parents and children to talk through the presented situations while exploring choices and examining the resulting consequences.<br /><br /> I chose Judge Judy Sheindlin's Win or Lose by How you Choose! for my son to assist him in social dilemmas that would require some thought. Children with autism are literal thinkers and lack in social situations, so having a book to go over before any of these challenges took place was the key factor in the purchase. It is somewhat similar to a social story many high functioning autistic children use to assist in the learning process as well as a stepping stone for promoting further socialization. By knowing the situations beforehand my son can reflect on these pages throughout the structure of his day.<br /><br />There are no page numbers inside Judge Judy Sheindlin's Win or Lose by How you Choose!. We jumped right into the book going through the scenarios until my son was ready for a break. The recommended age group is seven to twelve. With my son being at the bottom of this age bracket, I wanted to make sure we did not go through the entire book in one sitting, thus gradually making our way through the sequences of events profiled in the pages.<br /><br />There are several situations that could have more than one correct response. Judge Judy Sheindlin's Win or Lose by How you Choose! helps parents and children communicate which decisions fit the situation and discuss the outcome via these methods. These are everyday occurrences that involve not only children but adults and people that are going about their daily lives when they are confronted with a child or situation that needs to be rectified. The illustrations do not give away any answers, but do capture the confusion some of these dilemmas bring about.<br /><br />This would also make a good classroom book for a teacher to make copies of pages and give as an assignment and to utilize as a discussion forum. Parents will be enlightened by the responses their children make and know when their children are ready for more challenges ahead. This will encourage better understanding of social situations and offer some perspective on what they face on a daily basis.<br /><br />Judge Judy Sheindlin's Win or Lose by How you Choose! was a big confidence booster for my son. He enjoyed the discussions and laughed at some of the answers. These challenges brought new questions for him to explore and help him maneuver through the social mazes he encounters.

Second Edition	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Bankruptcy - Nolo Press guide	There are eleven chapters that cover Chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies. A bankruptcy is either liquidation (7) or reorganization (11,12,13). They can last from a few months (7) to several years (11). Chapter 12 pertains to a large debt due to a family farm.<br /><br />The questions and answers are categorized for Chapter 7 and 13, like the trustee and going to court. The meeting of creditors takes place 20-40 days after you file. My meeting took place a few weeks ago.  This is a meeting you must attend and have no input into the date and time it takes place.<br /><br />Filing the papers costs $209 in California. Once they have been filed all creditors must cease to contact you, utilities will not be disconnected if they were going to be, an eviction will be stopped, foreclosures and judgments get an automatic stay. It is mentioned that in some states loss of driver's license happens because of a liability for damages stemming from an automobile accident. The automatic stay will stop this from occurring as well. If you are dependent on the vehicle for family support filing bankruptcy might be the reason to keep your license.<br /><br />Filing bankruptcy does not stop the enforcement of child support or alimony. The book goes into this topic in various chapters. Federal, Local and State taxes are not discharged through Chapter 7. Student loans are not covered either, although if you can prove hardship a portion might get discharged.<br /><br />There is a checklist in a box format that covers each chapter. The back cover has a listing of questions referencing which chapter is covering that topic. There are some cartoon sketches in black and white that take reduce the stress level of this process. The index breaks down all the topics.<br /><br />It is also recommended that your maiden and married names be cited in your papers. The section with questions about how the bankruptcy affects your personal life discuss employment and living. This should not impact your job and there is no reason why they would know about it, unless your wages were being garnished. This will be listed on your credit report and you will need to be diligent to make sure the creditors report this accurately. Filing for bankruptcy has nothing to do with jail, you did not break the law or lose your right to vote.<br /><br />Bankruptcy: Is it the right solution to your debt problems will help you learn the schedules, how to pick your exemptions and decide if you are using a paralegal, lawyer or doing the forms yourself. This is a great guide to show you all the necessary documents needed to prepare with examples.<br /><br />The author is a consumer debt expert.

The Primer For Parents are only two pages in length. There are some black & white photographs and stick figure drawings within the pages. The authors of this book have a 14-year old son with autism, they have been there, they get it and want to help the newly diagnosed families through the first steps when acquiring the diagnosis.<br /><br />There are ten chapters, glossary and acronyms, a note about the authors and illustrator as well as a look back at their journey into autism. The preface mentions offering insight into what you can expect and hoping the readers will feel validated in their own struggles. Autism: Now What? The Primer For Parents is an easy read that is not overwhelming. It is the ideal book for therapists, support groups, workshops, teachers and extended family. Since many receive the diagnosis or mention of the word \\"autism\\" in a report by an SLP (Speech Language Professional) this would be perfect for therapists to give to parents when new to this process.<br /><br />The section entitled, A Family's Journey into Autism - the authors share their experience from the diagnosis stage at three years of age, includes photos, a list of signs of autism they missed (not wanting to open gifts, difficulty nursing, a fascination with overhead lights and ceiling fans), denial, cycle of grief. This cycle includes denial, guilt, shame, isolation, panic, anger, bargaining, hope, acceptance, shock and depression.<br /><br />This book covers from getting the diagnosis to therapy, coping strategies, IEP, Glossary and Advocating. This is a good book to start with and grandparents would find it useful as well.	2004-10-20

While reading these two books any parent with a child on the autism spectrum will be shocked to learn what the parents ahead of us endured via professionals and the media based on their incorrect perception of autism.<br /><br />What I do not agree with is the promotional aspect of these books, suggesting autism can be cured and these kids have overcome the disability. The Sound of a Miracle is touted as a tribute to a mother's courage, yet after reading the same book, I feel that the mother failed the daughter and did not gain the proper insight into her autistic daughter Georgie.<br /><br />There are two parts to The Sound of a Miracle, with auditory training not being discussed for the first half of the book. Not wanting to criticize the author too harshly I feel the book delved more into her older daughter Dotsie, who passed away from Leukemia, the Mother's two marriages and her own addictions and religious beliefs. This could have easily been written into two or three books covering each topic in depth.<br /><br />There was a gap of many years from when Georgie graduated from college and the author wrote the book. Maybe by that time she could see more clearly how Georgie needed help right from the beginning. It was obvious that the author was not confident in her parenting skills and questioned herself throughout the process of raising children. The author had a hard time cuddling and receiving eye contact from the time Georgie was born in 1965, plus she knew there was something odd about her eyes, and she had a low apgar score. There always seemed to be turmoil at their apartment in New York. Her husband Bill was not very involved in the parenting aspects of the girls. Early in the story Annabel took the girls away for a few weeks one summer for a vacation. During this time Bill had an affair with her best friend and things went downhill drastically.<br /><br />Bill was not mentioned too often after that, and only briefly when Dotsie died and then when Annabel wanted to take Georgie to France. The Sound of a Miracle was upsetting to me because after Dotsie passed away Georgie was institutionalized for many years. This started as a trial since there was no alternative for Georgie. Annabel was intimidated by the staff at the institution and believed them when they stated her lack in parenting was to blame. At one point she was drinking and taking many prescriptions, ended up being committed herself. I found that period of time to be confusing because her mother and siblings were only involved intermittently. For a moment there I did not want to finish perusing this because I was not sure which direction The Sound of a Miracle was headed and found the passing of Dotsie very sad.<br /><br />How a parent at that time never heard of Dr. Bernard Rimland is beyond me. It certainly seemed to me that the author would not act on her own parental instincts and needed reassurance for every move and then it even took others to persuade her to remove Georgie from the institution and try the auditory training by Dr. Berard. While Georgie was at the institution her Mother met and married Peter and had two more children.<br /><br />The author actually pondered several times leaving Georgie at the institution and starting her own life with her new husband and children. She was not as devoted to her daughter as she wanted to have a normal child in her new son and not risk her daughter coming home and possibly hurting her baby.<br /><br />As the parent to two children with autism I did learn a great deal about the auditory aspects, but this was due to Georgie sharing her personal experience and not anything the author shared as the parent. All those years Georgie just assumed everyone saw and heard things the way she did, but she was crazy for not being able to handle these issues in the same manner.<br /><br /> On one hand I was truly disappointed in the first section of the book after reading the suffering Georgie had to endure due to no one researching further her issues. I was questioning the author remarrying and starting another family when I felt she had abandoned and failed her daughter. The most shocking part within the book was when the institution contacted her ex husband, Bill to try to persuade him to keep her from taking Georgie out of the country. Bill had some relative look into the Dr in Switzerland and agreed with Annabel that this was worth trying. Had it turned out otherwise I would have been very upset and feel the professionals should have been punished for their wrong doing and interference with her life.<br /><br />I do prefer books that have a positive outlook on autism and not those that base the outcome on a miracle. Although this is one of those in some aspect, it was still a worthwhile read to know firsthand what the journey has been like for others. But my children are autistic and from what I gather always will be since I am not looking for a cure, but do hope to actually hear the sound of my child's voice one of these days.<br /><br />As a reader I cared about Dotsie and Georgie and was heartbroken over the death of one and the lost childhood of the other. I came away learning more from the trials and tribulations of this family and know what to avoid when pursuing therapies and searching for schools for my children for future reference.he way she did, but she was crazy for not being able to handle these issues in the same manner.<br /><br /> On one hand I was truly disappointed in the first section of the book after reading the suffering Georgie had to endure due to no one researching further her issues.

There are also a few black and white photos in some of the chapters. The photos did not really have any affect on me and could have been left out. Also quite bothersome to this reader was the habit of smoking cigarettes that Julie had, plus the fact that never was this discussed on how detrimental it could be to her children.<br /><br />I would advise future readers to read the foreword after the book was been finished. I found it confusing reading about the test scores and mention of whether Drew was actually autistic or not better digested after learning the family dynamics beforehand. It is hard to comprehend on one page the dedication to several people who volunteered in the fight for Drew's life and then learning he has been cured and no longer viewed as being on the spectrum. I find that hard to believe as a parent and really did not focus on that aspect.<br /><br />Unfortunately Autism: From Tragedy to Triumph did not delve too far into the therapy, but centered more on the feelings of the mother through out the process of raising her kids and dealing with the stigma associated at the time known as Refrigerator Mothers. She left her husband who was not very involved with the kids and did not believe Drew was different from other kids. She did move to another State and the book glossed over much of their lives.<br /><br />The only parts I could relate to was doing most of the work herself by seeing professionals and caring for the daily lives of her children and the hassle of driving on freeways with a child that might open a door or get out of their seat. I did feel for Julie when they first started working at the autism clinic at UCLA with her viewing from the two-way mirror and cringing when her son would cry and they would continue at the same pace.<br /><br />Dr. Lovaas comes across as a caring and understanding professional and one of the first Julie came in contact when learning about autism. I did not agree with the requirements they maintained for being in the program. Julie was not allowed to mention that Drew had a disability when she enrolled him in school. I am not sure I would have done the same thing, but she maintained that secrecy and Drew supposedly turned out to be a normal child. The book really does a good job of sharing the struggles on a daily basis in the early years while raising three small kids and the sacrifices the siblings had to endure. In order to enroll Drew in the autism program Julie was informed her other son who was younger would have to be in a daycare program so she could concentrate fully on Drew.<br /><br />I would have liked to read more about the progress Drew made with the therapy. It just seemed to focus much on the autism in the beginning sharing the habits of the child that clearly indicated he was autistic and then after an unspecified amount of therapy he no longer had the diagnosis. Apparently I missed something in the book to have it happen so quickly. I was not happy when I read how to keep Drew focused on therapy Julie would not be able to feed him in the morning and the appointment was set closer to the afternoon. The therapy seemed very rigid and not flexible with more focus on that than the child, but they triumphed in the end so what do I know.ional and one of the first Julie came in contact when learning about autism.

This was one of the hardest books as a parent I have ever read through. The time period covered is late 1970s through the 1980s, when life was much different raising an autistic child.<br /><br />Tony was born in 1978 to Mary and Rich. After one week home from the Hospital Tony had crying spells that lasted hours. His six-week checkup showed nothing wrong, yet the crying would continue nightly for hours. Mary thought that nervous mothers made nervous babies and cringed each time the crying would start. Rich was not interested in having kids but Mary prevailed and they agreed to have two children. Mary found out she was pregnant when Tony was just seven months old and still crying four hours out of each day. The crying would start with interruptions like when a plumber entered the house or a barking dog while taking his nap.<br /><br />Although hard to believe, Mary was a Registered Nurse working in the Pulmonary unit. As a result of several ear infections Tony was on antibiotics often and at fourteen months old had an operation called a myringotomy.<br /><br />Tony was seventeen months old when Rene was born and not playing with other kids appropriately. Rich thought Mary was looking for flaws and hoped that with caring for Rene the problems surrounding Tony would subside. Tony showed no interest in Rene and Rene helped boost the parenting confidence that Mary lacked.<br /><br />The child development specialist was the first person to mention autism to Mary, who experienced terror after hearing this and some sort of psychic pain. The diagnosis was early infantile autism and functionally retarded. It was at this point in Fighting for Tony after the diagnosis that the profanity and abuse started.<br /><br />Mary described her family as one wounded cub, one normal baby and a depressed husband. Mary was overcome with sadness while Rich retreated deeper into his depression. Rene was the salvation and the one that Mary turned to when she needed comfort. Mary started doing more for Rene even though these adventures were feared by Tony who did not need the break in his routine. She packed the kids up and went to New Mexico to visit a friend. Tony screamed all night and the verbal abuse was evident in front of her friend who did nothing.<br /><br />By page 58 of the 170 pages the abuse was hard to read because this dialogue was so disturbing to me. I needed constant breaks from the tone of these parents and could not comprehend these thoughts shared on the pages of the book.<br /><br />It seemed that the light went on way past when it should have for Mary and she should have been focusing on learning and reading books much sooner than she did. One summer when Rich took one month break in the summer things spiraled out of control with Rene and Tony. Mary found a day-care center that was open around the clock so she could work the night shift. Turned out her kids kept the other kids up all night and Mary in turn paddled their bottoms on two occasions.<br /><br />There were some disturbing incidents of breakins from the teenagers in the area that Mary moved to after the divorce.  I felt this was really confusing and detracted from the book.  It was quite evident that Tony took a backseat to everything. Soon after they stayed at Rich's apartment and their lives resembled a regular family. They both decided at the same time to give marriage another shot so they remarried.<br /><br />It is amazing that no one ever reported Mary for abuse to her children. She had her children living in a bad neighborhood, all their items were being stolen and it took a long time for them to finally move or as she wrote they were driven out of town.<br /><br />The back cover states this is a book about misdiagnosis and how a Mother brought her child back. That is a bunch of bull based on the book I read. There was noreal evidence to this reader of Fighting for Tony. There is obvious distress by both parents in learning about autism and their fears and guilt play a big role in their daily lives.<br /><br />I would not want someone who just received a diagnosis to read such a book or to think such horrid thoughts just because their child is autistic.  Fighting for Tony includes eight pages of black and white photos of the family through the years. The most important lesson from reading this book is to love your child and treat them kindly.book I read. There was no real evidence to this reader of Fighting for Tony.

It is about being a sibling to an older brother and what life was like in his household. His father came and went and his Mother never pursued a diagnosis for his brother.<br />There are some very touching moments in the story about the author's two sisters and how they left the house and their marriages and how the older brother was perceived in the family unit.<br />Charles goes off to college and has a hard time leaving his brother behind with his mother. At this point in time there is no diagnosis for his brother. They did not send him to school. I believe this was around the 1950s. His brother is much older than he and Charles is more of a father figure to him.<br />Charles gets married and then has a son. It is around this time that he begins noticing similarities between his brother and his son. Once his son receives the diagnosis of Autism he approaches his Mother to have his brother tested.<br /> learned many lessons from his experiences. In this book he explains how people with autism cannot understand the words \\"before\\" and \\"after\\". The sequence that allows you to understand cause and effect. The sense of time can be radically impaired or absent. Other words we take for granted and not understood are then, sometime, did, will and so on. Autistic people have a hard time using a calendar and the concept of time as well as a lack in judgment.<br />One of the stories Charles retold is how when his son was about the age of thirteen and in a residential home, he broke either a window or a mirror. At the hospital, he asked Doctors and nurses not to give signs of sympathy or offer any kindness that an autistic person might misinterpret as reinforcement for their actions.<br />Instead he wanted to reinforce the message that glass can hurt. He stated that this incident never happened again. As a mother to two autistic preschoolers I have read about this type of behavior and I wrote these notes down when reading the book. I cried for the author as well because I can understand how difficult that must have been for him.<br />The one question that is most difficult, in my opinion, is WHY, for an autistic person. They cannot comprehend this. The author gives some very good examples of how they got around using that word and still got an answer.<br />I am also the sibling of a sister who had a brain tumor in the early 70's and the similarities of the author's experience and mine are parallel. I found this book to be the best family account of living with autism.<br />This is a fantastic book for all people who are involved in disabilities as well as for parents or siblings or even an adult with a disability.ote these notes down when reading the book.

I was a bit surprised to see this much detail being included. There are a number of penciled drawings accompanying some of the essays by Cary Pillo.<br />I imagine some of the essays could cause embarrassment for some families since the kids were quite honest with their feelings and interpretations.

Some of the essays offer advice on how to treat your sibling, while others have attended Sibshops and kept in contact with other siblings.<br />Each sibling cares for their brother or sister, worries about them when they are at school and has a basic understanding of the therapies involved with their siblings. The older siblings were able to express themselves with details on school placement and going out in the community with their special needs sibling.<br />A common statement from the siblings is how it is hard for them to do things they like because there is no one to watch their sibling with a disability and too hard to bring them along on outings in the community.<br />This has helped me as a parent to two autistic children because my older son is verbal and can comprehend that his brother is not like other kids.<br />I only wish books like Views from our Shoes: Growing Up with a Brother or Sister with Special Needs and Laughing & Loving with Autism: A Collection of \\"Real Life\\" Warm & Humorous Stories were around thirty years ago to assist me as a sibling.

Although it is not mentioned why this move took place, I assumed it was related to the father's employment. Adam's older brother is Jeremy, in the seventh grade and attending the junior high school. Jeremy is neurologically impaired and needs tutors in the home plus takes special classes in school. After playing baseball at the neighborhood field Adam caught the attention of a seventh grader named Eddie Gordon. Adam is flattered that someone wants to be friends with him since his brother's outbursts usually cause others to bypass him.<br />Mr. Gordon is the coach for the Little League team where Adam and Eddie are both pitchers. Adam's Mother encourages him to have his brother involved in the same things, so Jeremy ends up on the Little League team, even though he hates it, but his Mother wants him to be around his peers. Eddie has been picking on Jeremy since they moved into town, but Adam is not really aware of this due to being at different schools, so he ignores his brother's constant complaining of how Eddie calls him a retard on the bus and looks at him with mean eyes.<br />Throughout And Don't Bring Jeremy are many conversations with Adam, Jeremy and their parents at the kitchen table. It is quite funny to read how the author was able to convey just what a sixth and seventh grader feel and how they describe certain aspects of their parents in detailed observations. When Adam remarks how when his Mother makes a certain noise with her nose when she is exasperated I chuckled and tried to imagine such a noise! It is clear that his Mother has the last word all the time, but on the other hand she tends to push Jeremy off onto Adam and that seems unreasonable at times. I felt as a parent there was a lack of parental involvement on her part as she was always busy fixing and decorating the new house.<br />Jeremy likes to take his bike and ride around the block and this worries Adam, but as Jeremy says he is older and can do it too. But there is a third grader down the street that Jeremy stops and plays with to the discord of his Mother. She has repeatedly warned Jeremy to not go there and try to make friends with kids his own age.<br />Adam has described his brother as walking funny, eating gross and dressing sloppy with frequent outbursts that always caught him off guard and waiting for the next one to happen. He could feel when they were in stores and shopping that people were looking at them as the family with that boy.<br />And Don't Bring Jeremy is a quick and easy read for an Adult and geared to those who are between the ages of nine and twelve, especially anyone in the sixth and/or seventh grades. This would help those that have a child that is different in preparing for what is ahead once the child is at this age or grade level. The author has really captured the feelings of Adam and what he goes through on a daily basis because his brother is different.<br />Much of the story centers on the baseball game and how they make it to the All-Star Game as well as the friction between Eddie and Adam over pitching and the fact that Jeremy is jealous of his brother. Adam is cautious around Mr. Gordon as well because he is Eddies' Father and thinks he looks like a Sergeant.<br />I was very pleased to read And Don't Bring Jeremy, highly recommending this for anyone who has a child in this age range to teach about compassion and understanding of those who are challenged and different. I loved the way the boys transformed through the pages and really got a sense of being there with them in the town of Glen Haven.

Five years later Noel has not really responded to his brother due to his disability. Jacob now understands autism but sometimes is embarrassed to bring friend's over because his friends will think that Noel does things on purpose. Noel prefers to sit for hours rocking back and forth on the floor or watching a train move about without even moving a muscle.<br />As noted in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Autism chapter, a team of professionals such as a speech therapist, a child psychiatrist, a psychologist or a social worker will be the ones making the diagnosis of autism. It is not mentioned but I would also add that nursery school teachers, assistants, relatives and other school settings autistic tendencies or behaviors/symptoms can be prevalent and any of these individuals might make the suggestion of having an assessment done on the child.<br />The book explores what it is like to be a teenager with a sibling who is autistic and the feelings of isolation, guilt, pressure and resentment. There is also a list of what you need to know about autism and what you as a sibling can do to help. Autistic individuals tend to be visual learners and seek out the computer or television screen. A sibling can encourage the abilities the autistic child has by reading to them and speaking in a softer tone.<br />It is mentioned that the siblings have the longest relationship within the family unit. The older sibling could benefit from a support group at this time and learn from other siblings at \\"sibshops\\".<br />Other disabilities were mentioned, but Tourette's Syndrome was overlooked.

His wife Alice, son Matthew and daughter Meredith have all had to endure his OCD symptoms, but up until that moment they never knew what caused him to behave and act certain ways. It actually took a year from the date of the television show for Marc to contact Eric Hollander, M.D. again and seek help such as behavior therapy and medication.<br />The chapters are not all in chronological order. In one chapter he discussed waiting for Alice at the church and how his OCD symptoms flared up. He reflects back at this, since at the time he was unaware of OCD and that this was the reason for his behaviors. Alice was late in arriving at the church along with her family, causing Marc to panic and yell at her once she did show up. This was the first time Alice had seen him in this state of mind. The next chapter he explains how they meet, so it was a bit confusing for me at first reading of their wedding and then going back.<br />He brings along flip-flops for using in bathrooms at Hotels. He cannot have his bare feet touch any floor but his own at home. He laughingly described how he cleans in the shower with the flip-flops on and removes one while balancing on the other. He has rituals in how he gets dressed, such as he lays clean socks on sheets but never on the bedspread.<br />As a child Marc rushed home to watch Art Linkletter. Instead of wanting to be a kid on the show Marc dreamed of one day hosting a similar show. His brother at the time played the drums and toured with famous acts, causing jealousy in Marc and sibling rivalry. College dorm life was not pleasant for Marc. He ended up persuading them to give him a single room so he could have it clean at all times.<br />One disturbing symptom or character flaw that Marc has exhibited is the need to win no matter who he is playing against. He discussed playing basketball with his son and also playing monopoly with both his children. I wondered why his wife never initiated a strategy for his need to win, and why they allowed him to beat his kids and not teach them differently. There are some lessons here that I have picked up on how he was raised and then what his family avoided and never discussed.<br />The therapy methods the Dr used seemed a bit off in my opinion and unnecessary. They started with Marc waiting five minutes and worked up to an hour I believe that he would wait after the maid left to fix the house. In my opinion I feel the Doctor should have encouraged Marc to discuss this with the maid and try to avoid this anxiety and stress by explaining how the house should be cleaned. I imagine with the book out for a number of years now that the maid must know about this, unless she does not speak English.<br />I would have liked seeing a list of OCD symptoms from the Foundation and/or the criteria to have a diagnosis of OCD from the DSM-IV. I feel this would be beneficial to readers who may see themselves and/or family members in the traits that Marc describes.<br />The book is a good read, although it does lack the correlation between OCD and Tourette's syndrome and other disabilities.monopoly with both his children.

The reader gets to observe from a distance the delightful play between Ben and Spike, as well as the concerned look on Mr. Wayne when contemplating why Ben is never talking. I enjoyed observing the maneuvers Ben cooked up in an attempt to avoid talking. The concern that Ben showed for the dog increased as the weeks went by, drawing the reader into this blossoming friendship.<br /><br />One aspect in the text of the book was a bit different to me. Each time a comma was placed on the page it was followed with a period. I tried not to let it distract me, but I did find myself trying to copy the format when taking notes. Basically the period was on top of the comma, making them look like one character of text. I am not sure why this was done, maybe a signature style for the author.<br />As far as books go about teaching children on issues relating to disorders I did not feel this book did that great a job. I was impressed more by the illustrations than the neat story that had the happy ending, if only it were this easy to overcome stuttering for a child.	2003-08-18
US	47419134	R2SA4VK2VKHGA5	0807532185	281625617	He's My Brother	Books	4	4	4	N	N	The Invisible Handicap	He's My Brother is written about a boy named Jamie who suffers from an \\"invisible handicap\\", from the viewpoint of his older brother. When reading through the book you feel you are going through this process along with the brother as he is sharing snippets of Jamie's life alternating between black and white illustrations and then colored pages.<br />At first it seems like the black and white illustrations are when the brother interprets Jamie is sad and then the colorful pages are when he is home safe with his family, happy just to be himself.<br />The first page has an image that really makes you stop and think of what life is like for these children, especially those that cannot verbally express themselves. This one is black and white and has Jamie looking out a open window with a blank stare. The author/illustrator really captures the empty feeling that Jamie most likely has as the words describe his brother's thoughts, \\" Jamie's my brother. He doesn't have many friends.\\"<br />There is no mention of exactly what disability Jamie suffers from, but a hint that it could be a learning disability when the subject matter is school and his brother notes that when it is noisy James gets mixed up at school.<br />I really enjoyed reading through He's My Brother and sharing it with my eight year old son to help him understand his own brother a bit more.<br />This book is suitable for those with children who have a learning disability, sensory integration dysfunction, autism, ADD, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, PDD, OCD, MR and other disabilities that might be considered an invisible handicap. Perfect for teachers, school libraries, sibling support groups, and relatives.<br />Although it is an older book, the illustrations and text are well suited to the current year.	2003-08-18

It just so happens that the new girl Sarah who carries a large backpack has taken notice of Andy.<br />From the very first sentence, \\" Andy was a real puzzle to Sarah.\\" I get a sense that the author knows first hand the trials and tribulations of raising a child with autism, since the autism ribbon is known as a \\"puzzle\\".<br />During recess each day while Rosie was playing soccer she would watch over at the hopscotch area where Andy was engrossed with his yellow frisbee. She was not pleased when Sarah started observing her brother and getting closer to him. All Rosie could think about while trying to focus on her soccer game was whether Sarah would invade Andy's space and be able to understand his speech if he tried to talk to her.<br />The soft pastel illustrations play out the story line with the body positions of Andy and Sarah and the busyness of the other kids in the background. While sitting there during recess Sarah pondered what it was like being new at the school as she checked her teddy bear inside her backpack. Rosie had noticed the large backpack of Sarah's when she first arrived at the school and was cautious, but it turns out this was to keep her favorite item with her for extra comfort. Sarah decided that Andy's yellow frisbee could be a comfort item like hers.<br />This was an interesting spin on comparing how a new student at school feels to the child who prefers to be alone in their own world. Something about Andy and his daily routine in spinning the yellow frisbee caught the eye of the girl allowing her to open up and meet others because of this.<br />The relationship between the siblings shows the compassion and lengths Rosie goes to keep her brother safe and make sure his environment is comfortable so he can continue with his spinning. Instead of showcasing him as being different he almost seems carefree and not strange as other books have portrayed those with disabilities. I highly recommend Andy and His Yellow Frisbee to those within the special needs community, special education system and families and neighbors of those with various disabilities. This will open the lines of communication and get children to discuss their feelings and how they view those who are challenged.erent he almost seems carefree and not strange as other books have portrayed those with disabilities.

The attention to detail that Stephen Shore includes from both his experience as one growing up autistic but not really knowing it to his teaching children with autism is very powerful.<br />I was thrilled when I read how one of the Mother's to a student he was teaching music to insisted on the Mayer-Johnson augmentative communication device as this is what my non verbal son is using within his speech and occupational therapies.<br />Stephen discusses the first time he learned to shave which has resulted in having a beard all these years, and it looks good as well.  The fascination with spinning and how it led to his love for bicycling as well as his insight into the world of dating helped prepare me for when my children are older.<br />Having listened to Stephen Shore this past March at a Convention in Los Angeles I found myself wanting to re-read Beyond the Wall and share it with many other families, teachers and therapists.<br />After reading Beyond the Wall I felt like I really got to know the author and like him very much.  He proves that that success can be achieved for those who have autism or asperger syndrome.<br />This is one of the best on the market and a must have for all families who have a member on the spectrum.	2002-05-10

For any parent of an autistic child you might want to read this alone the first time because it can be quite emotional.<br />You will become more aware of the day in the life of one who is autistic and never take a simple walk to the park for granted and see through the eyes of all those who resemble Ian.	2002-05-10
