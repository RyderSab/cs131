But after getting the book and removing the shrink-wrap, it is nearly impossible to read.  The layout is similar to ESPN's Magazine, with small colored print on top of colored background, pictures without captions, etc.  This was supposed to be for my Dad, but at his age he won't be able to read this.  Heck, I can barely read it, and I don't even wear glasses.  I'll never buy a shrink-wrapped book again.  I should have known better.	2003-06-03

In addition to dozens of simple factual errors, such as when Jim Rice joined the Red Sox and when the DH was instituted, there are many more that reflect the authors' ignorance of baseball, such as his statement that a Red Sox infielder lost track of a ground ball hit by Johnny Bench in Bench's shirt (!?!), or that a major league hitter has one half a second to decide whther or not to swing at a pitch.  Well, the former would mean the ball was tracking the runner as he ran and staying about five feet off the ground, violating several laws of physics, while the second is true for slow pitch softball - but a 90 mph fastball reaches the plate in about .35 seconds - that batter must decide to swing in about .15 seconds.  Every time I pick this book up I find something in it that infuriates me, simply because it treats its subject so cavalierly, as simple fodder for the author's indulgent word escapades.  He should have just written a novel instead of pretending to write history, but hey, it's easy when you can make things up. Very disappointing - I feel bad for the readers it has misled.	2003-05-06

This book is the best writing about the team ever put together, mostly from the newspapers, so it includes stories by guys who write now like Tony Maz and Buckley and Shaughnessy (not his obnoxious stuff) and old timers like Gammons, George Frazier and even Dave Egan. I'm a huge Sox fan but I hadn't read most of what is in here.  Original stories from ther 1903 1912 and 1918 World Series, too.  I mean this as a compliment, but it's perfect for the beach or the bathroom, or just to have next to your chair as you watch the Sox this summer.  It's perfect to browse through while watching a game.  I just wish it ended with the Red Sox finally winning the world series.	2003-04-15

Although the pictures range from very good to spectacular, the book reads like it was written by committee.  This is a sugar-coated history of the team, and not a very accurate one at that.  You would have thought that a team that prides itself on being the greatest franchise in sports would have paid more attention to their own story and paid more respect to their fans, but the words here are strictly to fill up the pages.  The official retrospective is just a picture book, and a very pricey one at that.	2003-04-15

In Madden's eagerness to write a Yankee love letter, profiling former greats reminiscing about their careers as a Yankee, he forgot to include any insight or much else of interest.  There are better interviews and profiles of just about every figure in this book in a host of other Yankee books (including some by Madden), and it simply gets tiresome to read the same sentiments (and often the same stories) over and over again. The books reads as if the author decided ahead of time what he wanted from his subjects and once he got that, moved on.  There are plenty of missed opportunities to probe further into the lives of his subjects, but I guess the marketing reports indicated that readers weren't interested.  Good for gluttons only, but there are better birthday cards than this to celebrate the Yankees 100th anniversary.	2003-03-25

This is really four books awkwardly crammed into one, and if you think it's about Catfish, Charlie Hustle and the Spaceman, it's not.  Partially a profile of the '75 Sox, partially a profile of the Reds, a basic retelling of the 1975 World Series and then, at the very end, a pretentious and incomplete conclusion tacked on that tries to make case that this World Series somehow changed changed baseball.  It might have, but not for any of the reasons cited here.  The problem is that each of these four books is incomplete.  As a Sox fan, the book told me little that I didn't already know about either the Sox or the Series.  And the portion of the book about the Reds focuses almost entirely on Johnny Bench's failed marriage, which is totally out of place here.  Add to that a handful of factual errors and The Long Ball is more like a weak pop up to shortstop.  In this book, the '75 World Series isn't very momorable at all.	2003-03-25

This book cashes in on the anniversary of the first World Series.  That's an interesting subject but Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe makes light of the entire project through obvious lack of effort.  I don't know what made me madder.  The way the lines were spaced out to make the book look longer than it was, (its more like a magazine article) the lack of research that makes this an incomplete story, or the amateur writing style.  Ryan tries to imitate the writing style at the turn of the century.  The result is hysterical, but I don't think he meant it to be.  I feel gypped and hope other readers don't encourage this kind of sloppy work. I think other books written about the World Series or the Red Sox recently cover this topic much more completely.	2003-03-20

It's not really a history of the team at all but a lot of lists and stories and quotes and stats. Some are interesting but others aren't. Although the book has plenty of pictures they are printed awfully small and the paper is sort of thin so the pictures bleed through from one page to the next, which makes it sort of distracting to read.

What it is is a serious but very readable book, the best (and longest, believe me) history of the Yanks ever written.  As a SABR member I'm certain there's never been a book about the Yankees like it beofre.  Their other book, Red Sox Century is supposed to be just as good.  I haven't read it yet but I will now.<br />I heard about this one at the SABR convention, where I one of the authors gave a talk about how the Yankees really got Babe Ruth, and on ESPN, which ran a story from the book, about how the Yankees almost moved to Boston after buying the Babe, which was news to me.  Now that I have read the whole book I'm not disappointed, and there are many other untold stories from beginning to end.  I can't think of another Yankee book that is as complete as this one and I've read them all.  It tells the history of the team in one big story instead of just writing about the World Series or Babe Ruth or Mickey Mantle.  This is a book you can spend hours with and I already have (Yea, no strike, go Yanks!).<br />I never really knew how the Yankees were created or much about the team before Ruth, but I do now. There's all sorts of information on the early history of New York and how the city and the team helped make each other waht they are today. Instead of the same old stories over and over like most other books about the team, this book tells it like it is and how the Yankees became the Yankees.  In particular, I really enjoyed the stories about the 2001 season and postseason last year, from 9/11 onward.  Almost made me cry but really put it all in perspective, too. <br />You've just got to read this to believe it.	2002-09-02

As a longtime reader of this consistently satisfying series, this years' edition just might be the best one yet.  It is  meatier than the last few years and each story in the book seems a little bit better than the last one.  As always, there are surprises, too, not only of more obscure sports (wreck diving, poker and surfing) but in point of view, re: Gene Collier's farewell to sportswriting and Charles Young's meditation on losing.  But there's plenty of straight sports, too; Tiger Woods, DiMaggio, Ripken, etc., and big names like Reilly, Pierce and Bissinger.  And maybe it's me, but there's an odd, antidotal prescience to this book in these strange times.  Collier's story alerts us to the real heroes, and if you need an uplift, read the story called &quot;Toughest Miler Ever,&quot; for a true profile in courage.  Collins introduction is vintage, and well, that's it.  I don't want to spoil it for you, but I enjoyed this so much I rather wish I had another to read right away.	2001-12-06

This is not that.  In this book Neyer spends a season in the stands of Fenway Park thinking not so deep thoughts, not so much about baseball, but about Rob Neyer, who just isn't that interesting.  Had he sat in the Metrodome watching the Twins he would have written much the same book.  The result is a self-indulgent letter to oneself which read like like sitting next someone in the stands who just won't stop talking about stuff you just don't care about.  The format just isn't his forte.  Without the numbers fueling his ideas, he is an empty vessel.  Neyer awkwardly tries to adopt all the qualities he imagines Red Sox fans to have, and he does.  All the annoying ones, without providing any insight whatsoever. As a chronicle of one of the more forgettable seasons in recent Red Sox history, the book is adequate, because in between the &quot;Song of Himself&quot; is the basic story of a season (2000).  Unfortunately there is little in this season that is particularly notable, and that part of the book is already badly dated.  Personal memoirs like this aspire to uncover something universal in the particular, but the only universe revealed here is that of someone who incorrectly thinks his every thought is worthy of preservation; they are not.  Easily the most vapid Sox book since &quot;Player for a Moment,&quot; and that's saying something.	2001-11-16

Chase is one of the more controversial figures in the history of the game and worthy of a full length biographical treatment, but this reads like a private genealogy; since the author comes to none but the most tentative conclusions, the day-to-day probing of Chase's activities is, in the end, numbing and tiresome, a pointless excercise in minutiae as the author sits squarely on the fence in regard to each and every of the many indiscretions that marred his career.  A book should amass information and through the authors' powers of insight and persuasion, arrive at some kind of conclusion or point of view. This does not, and I wish it did.  While this will be useful as a source book for those who want to know what Chase did during a given season or particular time, the larger questions around Chase and gambling are not advanced beyond what is already known.

At first blush and on a brief perusal, it looks like a handsome, serious, thoughtful biography.  But upon reading it is mostly hackneyed filler and exhibits no true scholarship.  Instead of really telling you anything of importance about Gehrig, you get colorless run-downs of his seasons and a hodge-podge of information primarily culled from other books.  That's not entirely bad and not without some merit, for the definitive Gehrig book has yet to be written and this will have to do for now, but it does his subject a disservice.

Four, given Williams' recent debilitating illness, there is something a little weird about bringing out a book like this at this time.

I don't care a wit about occasional typographical erroros or the like, but when significant portions a project are rife with errors, I have to question the remainder.  Sadly, that's the case with this book.  The chapter on Cy Young is based entirely on an interview with John Tunis, who saw Young pitch.  If only Kahn would have fact-checked this interview!  Suffice to say, there are significant errors of fact throughout this section - Tunis's memory is flawed and Kahn's concern for accuracy apparently non-existant, a problem that destroyed his Pete Rose book.  Have other readers found the same in other sections of this book?  I wonder . . .  and in the end, although I admire Kahn as an entertaining stylist, he should know better, and makes this book a disappointment.	2000-11-24

This was, for a long time, my favorite Red Sox book.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't hold up anymore.<br />Several recent books have told the Red Sox story, or at least large portions of it, better and more accurately, beginning with Golenbock's \\"Fenway,\\" Keene's \\"The Babe in Red Stockings,\\" and Waterman's 1918 chronicle \\"The Year the Red Sox Won the World Series.\\"  All of these books combine to cast doubt on significant portions of Shaughnessy's tale, particularly the story of the Curse itself.  An even more recent title, \\"Red Sox Century,\\" (to which, oddly, Shaughnessy contributes an essay) completes the job thouroughly, retelling this story and many others much more completely.  In light of these other revelations, re-reading the Curse, as enjoyable as it is at times, is also disquieting.  Facts upon facts are called into question, and make Shaughnessy's rendering of the Red Sox story appear as more a work of fiction.  It seems impossible that he could have gotten so much so wrong, but the evidence in the above titles seems irrefutable when compared against the details of Shaughnessy's book.  While the Curse remains enjoyable, it just appears that much of it is simply factually incorrect.  Fairy tales have value, but it is time to grow up.  This book is like a cherished baseball record, once considered unassailable, that has been broken several times over. <br />Sox fans have long clung to the Curse as the defining moment in franchise history.  Unfortunately, it now seems as if we've been worshipping a false god the whole time.	2000-11-07

Consistently great, always interesting and occasionally just plain fantastic sports writing, although I don't think you need to be a jock to enjoy this book - writing by Mailer, Talese, Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson  speak to everyone regardless of the subject.   This is a book to read and  savor over a long period of time, to return to often, and share among  friends.  Halberstam's picks give the book a surprising and provocative  historical edge.  While the omission of A.J. Leibling and a few others are  surprising, it's more than made up for by the inclusion of some superb  surprises.  Take this book on vacation - or take a vacation by reading this  book.	1999-07-19
