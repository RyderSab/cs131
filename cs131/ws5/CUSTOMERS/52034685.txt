I loved the chemistry between the 2 main players. It did take me a while to warm up to Heath and his very alpha male ways, but SEP develops him nicely in the end.<br /><br />I have to disagree with several other reviewers on the secondary romance. I thought it was distracting and skimmed those parts hurrying to get back to Heath and Annabelle who I thought were much more fun and interesting.	2005-08-21

How can anyone find this beautiful and inspiring? I thought it was very depressing and sad and very frustrating. Isn't anyone upset that these kids had to deal with this abuse? I guess being a neglectful parent is OK nowadays.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, I too question her reliability on all the details she gave when she was so young. Highly suspect.	2005-07-29

The new age/positive chi stuff became old after a while. I think the author could have worked on developing Bunny and Nate more and lay off some of the extraneous secondary stories like Bunny's mom and dad. It wasn't the worst I've read, it was just average.	2005-07-25

True, there were some funny lines here and there. But, overall, he went on too long in many places and didn't spend time on other things that would have made it much more interesting to me. For instance, why didn't we learn more about his relationship with Sylvia during this difficult adventure? His lack of ambition and other quirks must not have bothered her since she married him and they had a child. Also, there must have been more islanders he could have shared some poignant moments with us about instead of dwelling on all the excrement. Apparently he preferred bathroom humor.	2005-06-27
US	52034685	R3K6EYXM07IFN6	0380007789	856556145	The Wolf and the Dove	Books	1	16	22	N	N	Not as good as her others	I've been re-reading some of this author's books after 20 or so years. Shanna and A Rose in Winter still stand up. The Wolf and the Dove does not. Keeping in mind things were violent in the time period this was set, I do not consider this romantic whatsoever.<br /><br />I agree with previous critics who state they couldn't believe how quickly Aislinn adjusted to the takeover of her home. On the one hand, it was refreshing to read a romance where the hero and heroine aren't always scratching their eyes out on the way to love, but this was awful. Wulfgar got his jollies spanking her? Yuck. I didn't care about these characters at all by the end.<br /><br />As far as the writing style, she is too long winded with detail. Even the books I love by her I have to do some skimming. She should shorten her books by 100 pages so the story itself really shines.	2005-05-23

The alpha hero had yellow eyes and long hair---an ewwww from the start. I didn't like how he manhandled Addie and their love scenes were a bit on the rough side, which is a turn off. Their \\"witty\\" dialogue and antics came off immature. And where was the romance? This could have been a much better book had the author taken the time to really develop the characters and insert some tenderness from time to time.	2005-02-20

It makes me wonder if I read the same book. The romance was definitely the strength of this novel but the mystery weakened the story as a whole. The characters were likable enough but the conclusions that were jumped to by Billy and others seemed to come out of thin air at times. Some of the elements of the mystery itself were far-fetched at best. It felt like it was the author's first attempt at including a mystery in her romances.	2005-02-05

Kate is at a crossroads in her life, both professionally and personally. She decides to move to Gospel, Idaho to help her recently widowed grandfather run his grocery store. On the way to Gospel, Kate hopes to live out a fantasy and have hot sex with a stranger at a hotel. Unfortunately, the tattooed stranger turns her down flat. Things get more interesting when the stranger turns out to be Rob, a former pro hockey player who runs a sporting goods store near her grandfather's grocery store.<br /><br />Although The Trouble with Valentine's Day is entertaining, it falls short. I have read quite a few Gibson books and consider See Jane Score her best by far. The dialogue and storytelling  keep the pages flying.<br /><br />The Trouble with Valentine's Day had promise but she needs to freshen things up a bit. Do we really need another hero with a tattoo? This time it's an enormous snake that wraps itself around Rob's body. Secondly, her fascination with light reflection---blue from the dashboard, gold from the window, etc.---gets old really fast. She does this in nearly EVERY book. It has become a distraction for me.<br /><br />Luckily, Gibson has continued with her humorous dialogue and interesting secondary characters. However, following her grandfather's sweet romance only points out the weakness in this story. While Kate and Rob generate hot, sweaty scenes, they are missing heart.<br /><br />Note: the author needs a better editor. Rob is a former hockey player from the NHL not the NFL. Geesh!	2005-01-31

I was impressed by her wonderful dialogue, particularly between the heroine and hero and the heroine and her sister.<br /><br />However, I agree with the other reviewers that the heroine could grate on you after a while. Her childish behavior and quick temper were annoying. Another annoying thing was the author's endless need to remind us that Lizzie wasn't as \\"frivolous\\" as she appeared. We got it the first few times. :-)	2004-12-31

The past 2 have been declining but #10 was the worst. Where is the snappy, funny, original dialogue? Everything is soooo tired. I realize plot was never the strength of this series but puhlease.<br /><br />I am not looking forward to the next one and it pains me to say I don't really care about the characters anymore. I'm just glad I didn't spend any money on this junk and read a library copy.<br /><br />I think Evanovich needs to take a break from this series for a while. She's disappointing die hard fans and for me, that's saying something.	2004-10-18

However, I don't think it's just the humor that makes this a great book. The characters have great chemistry, whether in romance or friendship. They are very likable.<br /><br />I did think Debbie Sue reminded me a bit of Stephanie Plum and how she got herself in crazy situations with physical humor. If you are reading this book for a strong, tight mystery, I think you will be disappointed. If you read it for the characters, then you will find it a worthwhile read.	2004-09-15

I could some it up in one word, \\"corny.\\" This really disappointed me due to all the positive reviews. I won't repeat some of the things others have said who didn't care much for the book. I agree wholeheartedly. It really felt like a first book with inconsistent plot points, dead ends, etc.<br /><br />As a positive, the characters were pretty well developed and quite likable. While Grace's professional life was completely unbelievable considering her personality and experiences, I did enjoy that the \\"unpopular\\" girl got the popular guy in the end.<br /><br />Speaking of the ending, it felt rushed and it become downright ridiculous at times. I also got very tired of the \\"tortured\\" hero routine.	2004-08-16

Sugar Beth wasn't very likable and I didn't really care for Colin, either. Their romance fell flat. I was more interested in Winnie and Ryan's love life then the main characters!

I found this to be an above average Irish tale. It was much more hopeful and humorous than Angela's Ashes. I was put off by the crude language though.<br /><br />It did read like a movie script with some of the humorous scenes obvious. There was heart that I didn't expect. Agnes is a refreshing character who is interesting to follow.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book.	2004-07-27

This was a horrible book. I had to skim it just to get through. The writing was awful. I had an inclination something was up when the letter from the editor had several typos in it!! Ugh. Caleb is a pretty good guy but Melanie was a flake! The dialogue was poor and the story took some bizarre and unbelievable turns.

In the end analysis I would say I've read better, I've read worse. The premise of the story grew thin after a while and I'm not sure how much I really liked Maggie. She was so domineering.

I thought the main plot line was good enough to keep me interested. The characters were well developed. However, I guess I differ from other reviewers on the secondary romance story line. There was great potential but in the end I thought it moved too quickly. I would have liked a longer courtship before they hopped into bed as it felt rushed and thrown in there to some degree! This happens way too often in romance novels.	2004-02-09

The dialogue was horrendous, the men were bullies and more interested in possessing their woman than any romance or love. I read the first novella but skimmed the second. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that in the 3 years since the first one (1981 and 1984) her writing would have evolved. Nope, it didn't. She originally wrote these under a pseudonym. I think she would have been better off never admitting to these.	2004-02-04

The characters, situations and dialogue were very real and believable. However, there was always an underlying of feeling sadness and dysfunction that I found to be too much of a downer to make me run out and tell all my book-loving friends to grab this and read. I wanted it to be a bit more charming/sweet to balance the depressing parts.	2003-07-13
