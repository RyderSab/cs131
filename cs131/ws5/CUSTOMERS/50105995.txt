NO, loving every book you read would be great but it never happens. I am talking about the fact that this book had the potential to be one that you read and re-read and never forget; instead, I have already forgotten most of what I read. The premise is interesting and everything is very creative but it just seemed insubstantial in the long run. Am I sad I read it? No, it was easy to read. That is one thing that is great about Gaiman, he writes very well. It's just the story where things get muddied. I realize you must have suspension of disbelief but some things would happen that made absolutely no sense in relation to the main plot. Some feel this adds to the book but I feel it hurts the mood. There are better books out there, go read them.	2002-05-07

A lot of books give you good, deep characters but this one gives you more than that. I felt like I was reading about old buddies after awhile and that only adds to the stakes when they are raised, and they are. The premise is solid and the flashing from present to future and back again works well. It(the evil entity of King's book) is a fully realized evil that makes for a scary read. That's not to say that this is King's scariest but certain scenes will give you chills. I found the book to entertaining and while I'm raving about the detailed characters and endless information let me say what sometimes made It a chore. The detailed characters and endless information. All of this makes for a deep, satisfying read but at points I found myself hoping for something to happen. Anything other than another encounter that felt just like the last. These are scarce moments but if you find 1000+ pages a daunting task you may wish to look elsewhere. This book's length and complexity are its strong points but they also slow things down. That said, this is a great read.	2002-04-02

Most fans of Koontz will like it and I imagine a lot of readers new to Koontz will find a new author to look for when visiting their favorite book store but ultimately this book falls short for what Koontz can deliver. I will not argue with a creative story but at times I felt the characters were throw backs to those in his past books. Cain was an interesting character but I feel like all his female characters are the same mold. I like the mold(strong, smart, resourceful, etc.)but at times it feels like their names could be interchanged and you wouldn't even notice. Other than that, I felt the story was a good one and Koontz's writing is wonderful as always. Some authors dazzle witth their use of language and Koontz is one of them. If you are new to his writing I suggest Fear Nothing first. It is hands down one of his best and will make you a fan for life.	2002-03-13

Very rarely does a book have both a good story and a created world in which the story takes place. Osten Ard, the setting, is rendered with great detail to the point where historical nuggets seem well thought out and not tossed at random by an author in a hurry. Indeed, it is this attention to important details that really make this book good. Notice I said important details, too many authors try to liven up humdrum stories with fantastorical details and fail miserably. William's created world and the characters he places in that world walk hand in hand. I will say that yes the book does start out slower than most but it builds to a steady clip, building on almost every nuance revealed early on. It is an enjoyable read but you must be a little patient through the first 50 pages or so. That said, I will not place it on the same scale as Tolkien or Jordan but it does compare with most other fantasy writers in today's market. Be warned though, that Willaims stay away from hack and slash so if that is your thing you will not like this book. If you enjoy a rich story with rich characters and old school adventurin than this is some of the best.	2002-03-13

No, really. I am a big fan of his work but, that said, I also have been wondering if the Companions of the Hall series should continue. I mildly enjoyed The Silent Blade but I have been looking for more from this series. The Spine of the World is the more for fans of Drizzt and Co. No, Drizzt is not in the book(although his always enjoyable personal observations are)but this can only be seen as something fresh. I have often felt that the character Drizzt has carried the other characters at times throughout the series. Especially Wulfgar, this book's main character. Wulfgar was always the counter to Drizzt's thoughts. Drizzt acts collected and calm, Wulfgar goes into a frenzy. Now, that is not how the characters always acted but it was almost good cop, bad cop. Now, with Spine of the WOrld, fans get a more fleshed out Wulfgar who doesn't seem whiny but contemplative. It is a different path for salvatore and one I hope will shake things up a bit. I understand The Crystal Shard is about Artemis and Jarlaxle; this should be very exciting for fans. I'm hoping for another book about Drizzt in the future but right now I'm enjoying the series kind of evolve. It makes things more interesting this way.	2002-02-25

The premise is that a young, uneducated woman in poverty is given the chance to win 100 million dollars if she will keep her mouth shut about how her winning this money comes about. She accepts and the story slowly lifts off from there. Like most good books, the story unravels slowly at first, the stakes raising towards a decent ending. I do not mean that to be negative to the plot, it is very interesting, but I had trouble even caring about the characters. It is a good read,though, and I reccommend it to fans of Baldacci but for those new to this author, try Total Control or The Simple Truth first.	2002-02-25

That said, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because while it was good it just wasn't one that stayed with me. I know I'm not reviewing literature(sometimes I hate that word) and this book delivers great entertainment but, personally, it does not touch Fear Nothing. I know, apples and oranges but I'm honest. The characters(one of the most important aspects to me) were great. The story was great. Well, maybe 4 and a half. The premise is not too far out there and everyone reacts in a very real way. While I enjoy stories that go way out on the limb it is good to see one that just puts a foot on that limb and makes sense in every way. Very good.  Read Fear Nothing first.	2001-07-05

The preceding two books(The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three) were great. This book continues the tale of Roland and Co. in their dark world which is a twisted mirror of our own. King further reveals how this world has &quot;moved on&quot; and gives us a look at the human side of Roland. If you have enjoyed this series so far you will be very pleased with this book. I couldn't get enough of Roland and his world and look forward to reading the next installment, Wizard and Glass. King's epic is one I can't wait to get to the end of but also one that I savor greatly. Everytime I put the book down I still couldn't help but think of the characters and that, to me, is what reading is all about. I always read some critic's review of how this or that author has characters you will never forget and then promptly do that in a few days but these characters will haunt you. Great read in what is one of the best stories unfinished.	2001-07-05

I think that the story had potential and it did interest me but something was missing. I'm not an expert and I don't claim to be, but I found the dialogue to be sketchy. It was not horrible, I have read horrible dialogue, but simple. I'm not saying he should have used words better suited for an college term paper, it just seemed too simple. The characters were well suited for their use of language, however. I never actually cared for the characters and therefore what happened to them made me feel indifferent.  They seemed to be hollow and stereotypical. Maybe this is what Saul was striving for to give it the old it could happen to anyone feel but it turned me off. I felt like I was reading an mystery for &quot;young adults.&quot; I still enjoyed the basic story though and it kept me going till the end which is a better ending than most. It wasn't cut and dry and let you know that the story went on after you closed the book. I will try another of his books because not only have I heard good things but his ideas are very entertaining which is how books should be. He obviously doesn't write to write but to tell a story. I wouldn't reccomend reading this one but finding one that has been better recieved by someone you know.	2001-07-05
US	50105995	R59SI2OOYXP55	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Average	I had a hard time liking this book but I also had a hard time hating it. The book started with an interesting premise and then shifted to humdrum storytelling. Don't get me wrong there were several creative aspects, including an interesting pyschological battle. But there wasn't much else. The story seemed to stall and start towards the end, making it a tedious read. King's books are not racing thrillers but this book defied everything his books usually entail. I usually really enjoy the characters and can't wait for the conclusion but this time I might have cared less. In my opinion this book should have been shorter. A lot of complex situations interwoven  can leave a reader feeling deeply satisfied when it is all over but this time it all lackd something. If you haven't read all of his other books read one you haven't already, they are better. If you must have it, check it out at the library or wait for paperback.	2001-05-08

Don't get me wrong, they are always interesting but I just wondered if there was anything new left in his writings. This book is wonderful. To me, it is one of those books that I will always remember. While that sounds sappy, let me explain why. The book kind of reminds me of the great books that made me fall in love with reading in the first place. Books like My Side of the Mountain and To Kill a Mockingbird. It is told through the eyes of a little boy growing up in 1950's rural Arkansas and deals with everything from accepting different people to just struggling through life. The innocent outlook thing may have been driven into the ground by several different authors but this is one of the few times it works. An authentic book that will make you remember why you read.	2001-04-23
US	50105995	R367TM5REOJOBR	0061098027	771444694	Free Fall	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Another nice read	While Storming Heaven was a bit better this book still keeps you reading and doesn't slow down. Mills seems able to create characters that seem real and react in real ways without boring the tears out of readers. His plots are usually of the national crises variety but in the end it is never wrapped up to please. It satisfies yet leaves you with the feeling that this would be how things would end. I love fiction but let's face it, some writers feel that they must please their readers with the clean break. Mills skips that. Add to that the usual surprises throughout and you basically get a book that you'll enjoy. Not anything new as far as the genre but a very exciting story. Recommend reading the first two books prior to this one for more of Mark Beamon.	2001-04-23

However, I still felt like something was missing. The book brings some more characters into the fold and does a good enough job so as it doesn't look rushed or sloppily thought up. There also seemed to be some more world building here as Salvatore introduced a few new areas and hinted at future events. The book seemed  to be the prequel for the next demon wars trilogy and I think it did a great job. Lose ends weren't tied up all neat and pretty either. I think that has been Salvatore's greatest asset in his most recent works. The anything goes clause. It makes for a more interesting story and definitly makes you pay closer attention. I reccomend this book and think the next one will be even better. Salvatore seems to really be getting good at this.	2001-04-19

This is a great first book in what promises to be one great journey through Goodkind's wonderful new world. One word of advice though, do not compare this to Jordan while reading it. not that it isn't on par with the  wheel of time(it may even surpass it at times) it will just ruin this great  book. I did just that at first and wasn't seeing how great this book really  was but soon got over that. This is a wonderful tale of large magnitude and  while it may have had a few fantasy genre flaws they were very few and  dwarfed by the spectacular world. The world Goodkind has created here  really draws you in. The characters are equally enthralling and even  secondary characters are interesting. Just like another well written  series. So, if you are waiting for that next great epic to come out, don't.  It is here and will give you everything for your time. It is long and so  are the subsequent in the series but that is what makes it great. Attention  to detail but not over doing it. Get this book and be prepared to step into  one that you won't be able to put down. Goodkind is one of the best  creators of the genre.	2000-04-17

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this book very much but it just seemed lacking in some ways. While  Stackpole has a good grasp of his characters from his x wing series( not to  mention great understanding of the Solo kids) he seems to be lacking when  writing about Luke, Leia, and an absent Han. It wasn't horrible I just feel  his stronger characters were of the x wings series, which is understandable  but star wars fan love their Luke. That said I feel this was a good  addition to the new major plot line and is very entertaining. It reads well  and that good old star wars universe feeling is always with you even if it  is somewhat darkened by the current story. My only real complaint is the  book's length which left a lot to be desired. I had read that when Del Rey  got the licsense they wanted to focus on longer novels but this one is way  off that mark with only 290 something pages. Hopefully the next one will be  lengthier and will have more Han. Where was he?  That said, this is a good  one for star wars fans and should fill that empty void till the next one  hits the shelves. Hopefully longer and with Han.	2000-04-17

In fact, I found it to be even better than the first one. The characters are all very well written and it flows along nicely. Plenty  of action, yet Goodkind still finds the time to go into detail about his  world and really make it come alive. The plot gets even more interesting  and looks to continue that way into the next book. I have to say that I  loved this book and have put it on my list of rereads in the future. If you  haven't read the first book don't wait any longer, go get it. And while  you're there pick up the second book as well. Very well done epic.	2000-04-17

It is not about serial killers however,and that may be a fresh change in his books. Or refreshed whichever way you look at it since  it has been rereleased. That aside, I found this book to be very fast paced  and exciting. While some things are predictable (unlike his current works  which leave you with the feeling that you will never know what will happen)  this book is still very much worth the read. Arch Carroll ( the main  character) is not as deeply defined as Alex Cross but this never takes away  from a great story that will move you along nicely. I am a fan of great  &quot;national security&quot; type books and found this one very satisfying  but if one is in the market for a serial escapade then this is not the book  for you. If you are in the mood for an abridged Clancy type book then by  all means have at it. Will not disappoint!	2000-04-17

He returns to his old grounds with a supernatural horror/thriller but that is by far too simple of a  description for what  Desperation is. The book has a really great cast of characters who you  really begin to care for and see some of each one in yourself. Also the way  the King has set this book up is magnificent in that it fits together  perfectly and delivers the story in a grand way  that produces the great  reading that I have now come to expect from King. I have read a handful of  King's other books and I would have to say that this is my favorite. I  enjoyed the Green Mile but I loved this one even more. I can't wait to get  my hands on The Regulators. If you have ever read Stephen King and liked it  then get this one. If you have never read one of his books this is a great  place to start. Enjoy the addiction.	2000-04-06

First let me say that each book in this trilogy is great but that this is the one that makes the whole trilogy very special. Drizzt struggles with what he might have become and continually searches for what he is. I love  the Drizzt monologues at the beginning of each book and that's just one  detail that all adds up to make this book one to read over and over. Sure,  some of the stuff is predictable but the characters and ideals they  struggle for are what bring magic to this one. As you get older you get  very cynical. This book may not change that but it reminds you of the  things you used to very strongly believe in. Not in a campy way either but  through the trials the characters go through and the theme of the book. In  this sense, The Halfling's Gem reminds us of what is important like friends  and respecting people. It also constantly entertains like few others. Don't  miss!	2000-04-06

Streams of Silver, the second book of the icewind dale trilogy, is a very fast and enjoyable read. I have fallen in love with these characters like no other in all of fiction and can't wait to share in more of their grand  adventures. This is what fantasy is all about and Bob Salvatore has  certainly created something truly unique here. The book has a great story  and moves at a good pace with lots of very well described detail.

The dialogue gets weak in spots but it is just like the comic book so no real complaints there. Spiderman flings the one liners and sometimes  they're funny and sometimes... Otherwise the story is full of great action  and even a glimpse into the life of MJ. The author has done a really good  job at putting spiderman into a novel and not making it unimaginative. This  is great buy for all action adventure fans and a even better read for those  who love the Amazing Spiderman.

This being the third book in the x wings series you may think it will begin to lose some steam but, let me tell you with great joy, it does not. The plot gets deeper into the goings on of the most elite squadron in the  galaxy and the action hardly wavers. Stackpole really knows how to give the  reader that star wars atmosphere and this book is no exception. You get to  know the already familiar characters even better while even meeting a few  new ones. I can not say enough for how well these characters are portrayed.  Good guys and bad alike are very interesting, a reason this series has  gained so much popularity. Overall, if you enjoyed the first two in the  series this one is even better and it looks like the books to follow will  be equally entertaining.	2000-03-22

This is one of those books that reminds you why you first started reading fantasy and it is a most enjoying read. There  were a few weak spots towards the end with the outcome but otherwise  Salvatore has really started something special here. Knowing that he has  already written lots of Drizzt books since this one is really exciting. I  have read a lot of reviews about this series and (like always) there have  been mixed reviews. I have to say though for your money's worth this book  is great. There is plenty of action and it is very descriptive. Salvatore  is a master at describing this action to the point where you would swear  you are actually watching it on the big screen. The characters are good  also, as in this first book you are introduced to them and their  backgrounds. Although this area had some weaknesses in explaining things  away to easy it was still interesting. Can't be too picky. So the bottom  line is that this is a must read book and despite the few minor flaws very  good.	2000-03-22

He has really spun a great one here. The characters here think and act like real people, and while this can be boring in some novels( who wants to read about real people? just kidding) it is a treat in this one.

It is also a very fast read and there is never a lull in the action of the book. Spenser's great dry wit and creative responses continue to be  some of the many reasons we can't get enough of this character. Sometimes I  found some of the events in this book to be a little farfetched but that is  what I love about these books and the stories Parker brings to us. He is a  great storyteller and if you have never read one of his books do so now.  Bottom line on this book: if you are a fan of spenser buy it but if you  have never read any of the spenser books(not that there is a certain order)  you might want to start you spenser addiction with Early Autumn or All Our  Yesterdays.	2000-02-20

I will begin this by saying that this book, Vector Prime, was quite good. There were all the great characters that we all know and love. Add to that an new evil threat that has one wondering about the future of the new  Republic and you come out with a book that was good, but different. I think  that it is the fact that there are hardly any trademark moments of humor or  safe moments when you know everything is going to be okay. Don't the good  guys always win? No, they don't and I think the galaxy far far away just  got a little tougher. I also think the story line will definitely get more  interesting thanks to what RA Salvatore has brought to the star wars  universe. True, this book did not have some of the lighter side that is  found in most star wars novels but it has on a whole made the saga a little  bit richer. RA Salvatore is a great author and one of my favorites but I  honestly did not how he would handle star wars. I'll admit I was skeptical  when I read the first reviews but I was impressed by what I actually read.  It was a solid read. Bottom line: buy the book now if you &quot;just can't  wait&quot; but if you can wait, then do so for the paperback. It is good,  but not the best star wars novel to date.	2000-02-18

No kidding and the book earns everyone of those five stars I gave it. If you enjoy fantasy or even have the slightest interest in it then I suggest you check out this book and the numerous others that  RA Salvatore has written. This was the first RA salvatore book I read and I  read it a while back but it has stuck with me. The whole demon wars trilogy  is fantastic. Not the usual sluggishness that comes with some trilogies but  stays fresh the whole way through. I was very impressed with salvatore and  I'll certainly be looking more his way the next time I want a great fantasy  read. The characters weren't weak but well thought out and even minor  characters came through well. The story was fast, interesting, and the  detail to action let me see it as if on the big screen. I think Salvatore  writes for Jon Woo on the side but seriously the bottom line is to go buy  this book as soon as you finish reading this. Why are you still here  reading this! Go now!	2000-02-18

If you enjoy great reading and great characters plus a fast paced novel than you must read this. You never have a slow part and you never feel like it is all happening too fast. I had bought this  book a couple of months ago and been reading other books for awhile  figuring I would just get around to it but why in the world did I wait? It  makes a lot of the other thriller/mysteries out right now look naive. If  you are even half interested get this book and read it. Awesome!	2000-02-07

You never get bored with the characters or the plot. The wrld building is great. I always hear that in fantasy novel descriptions but I am not just throwing that word out here.  This one is great! If you are waiting for some of the other series to  finish up read this Riftwar Series. It is not just a filler between great  fantasy books but one that you will remember for a long time. May make  those other books seem like fillers with Feist's new series coming out. In  any case, the bottom line is that if you like fantasy get this book because  it will not disappoint	2000-02-05

Atlantis Found is a great action/adventure book. Like all the Dirk Pitt novels there is action, romance, bad odds, unforgettable entrances, and dry wit that make it classic Pitt. I did say classic because I believe that  these books are. Sure thay aren't literary giants and your kids probably  won't have them on their summer reading lists but no where else can you  find a book that is filled with more adventure and fun than in a Dirk Pitt  novel. Atlantis Found does not disappoint either. It never gets repetitive  or boring and while sometimes the odds get high and the escapes narrower,  you never say &quot;hey, that can't happen!&quot; because with Dirk Pitt  you know it can. Thank you Mr. Cussler for giving us great adventures that  we can go on in the safety of our own home.	2000-02-05
