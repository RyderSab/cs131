He believes that a person, who is willing to put in the effort and time, can amass wealth in a period of 7 to 15 years.  I think that timing is a bit optimistic, but even if it takes 20 to 25 years, the end result is still the same - financial independence, more freedom and tranquility. Masterson believes one's primary goal is to accumulate enough capital to generate passive income to pay for life's necessities.<br /><br />This 271-page book is divided into only six detailed chapters.  Each one explains one of the six steps to achieving wealth, which are:<br /><br />1. Face the facts - you won't get rich saving 10% or more in your pension plan or getting measly salary increases.<br /><br />2. Plan to become wealthy - This is occurs one step at a time and requires planning.<br /><br />3. Develop specific wealthy habits - work hard, good a what they do, are extraordinary savers, pay themselves first<br /><br />4. Radically increase your income - to the tune of 25% to 150%<br /><br />5. Get rich while you sleep - by receiving passive income<br /><br />6. Retire early - to live the lifestyle you want<br /><br />Masterson provides specific examples of each of his six steps, as well as personal experiences and appropriate stories.  It all seems very real and makes a lot of sense. He mentions that an individual has to make getting rich a priority and be willing to focus his/her energies on building wealth.  He also covers the need to have a detailed short-term and long-term written action plan with specific goals.<br /><br />The author suggests that everyone choose specific lifetime goals; calculate their retirement income needs based upon an analysis of assets and liabilities, and lifestyle requirements.  He then recommends that individuals prepare wealth building goals, health goals, personal relationship goals, and personal growth and development goals. These goals should be set for daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes.  He is a strong believer in time management and suggests managing time in 15-minute increments so that multiple goals can be worked on during the day.<br /><br />Masterson believes that real estate can provide significant income and spends time covering how to invest in real estate and what the income should look like.  Although he does mention investing in the stock market, he only invests 2% of his money in it. He is reluctant to plunk down a chunk of his money in stocks because they are too risky for him.  Obviously, looking back the stock market's devastation during 2000-2002 and the real estate market's appreciation during that time period, his advice seems right on the mark.<br /><br />He feels the stock market is a very difficult place to make money, and that investors should tread lightly there. For those who invest, he strongly urges them to cut losses at a specific level (25% for him), and use stop loss orders and trailing stops to protect profits.  He does not recommend investing in the market unless you have at least $100,000 to invest.<br /><br />He is a strong believer in investing a sizable portion of income in side businesses and local real estate to build wealth over time. He prefers investing in income generating real estate, buying rental properties, and buying fixed income investments - holding bonds to maturity to avoid any principal losses due to rising interest rates.<br /><br />Overall, Masterson does a masterful job of explaining the steps necessary to accrue wealth and enjoy life.  For those who believe that investing in the stock market is a critical element in the process, as I do, I recommend a newly published book by Paul Merriman titled \\"Live it Up without Outliving Your Money\\" which provides a conservative way to build a highly diversified portfolio that has outperformed the market with less risk.hly timeframes.

Merriman has leveraged his 40 years of investment knowledge and educational efforts into a readable, easy-to-understand guide to risk-controlled retirement investing. Most investors have no clue as to what to do to become successful in the long run.<br /><br />This book will help them get there.  As Merriman has said, \\"Investing is a journey and you need a roadmap.\\"  That is exactly what he provides. As Merriman points out investors need to become defensive investors and have a plan of action, otherwise they probably will not reach their goals.  He urges investors to put their investments on automatic pilot.  As a long-time investor, author and financial advisor, I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />Merriman first lays out the 14 basic elements of why investors fail to achieve their investment goals.  He then covers the important topic of the psychology of investing, where most investors' problems begin.  He then reviews the importance of risk management, and provides eleven questions that every investor needs to answer to assess his/her risk tolerance.  He discusses the difference between intelligent risk and emotional risk.<br /><br />The heart of the book, chapters 6 through 9, reviews the components of the \\"perfect portfolio.\\"  He builds each portfolio from the simple to the more diverse, resulting in a portfolio that has a higher return with less risk because of the diversification of assets classes and the use of international and domestic funds, value and growth funds, and small- and mid-cap funds. Merriman illustrates specific percentage allocations for each of the categories just mentioned. He progresses through five portfolio iterations, each time fine-tuning the portfolio and adding additional market segments.  From a basic 60% equity/40% bond portfolio offering an annual return of 10.4%, and a standard deviation of 12.2 from January 1973 trough December 2004, he ends up with a portfolio of 10 different investment components which produced a return of 13% with a standard deviation of 11.7.  That's a higher return with less risk, a very desirable outcome.<br /><br />In addition to the five generic portfolios mentioned above, Merriman provides readers with the \\"perfect portfolio\\" with different fund families including the exact funds to purchase and their component percentages in the Vanguard, Fidelity and Charles Schwab universe. He also includes the Dimensional Fund Advisor family, which offers funds through advisors only, as well as his own Merriman model portfolio with a mix of funds. He also provides two all-equity tax-managed portfolios.<br /><br />Merriman points out the enemies of mutual fund investing - annual expenses and taxes - both  resulting in lower returns.  He also makes the case that variable annuities are a bad investment for most investors because of the high expenses.  Unfortunately, Merriman does not mention the variable annuities that provide a guaranteed income benefit or a guaranteed return of principal, no matter how poorly the stock market performs.  A more thorough explanation than the 2-3 pages provided, of the positive and negatives of annuities, is needed.  Investors who owned these types of annuities during the market's 2000-2003 bear market came out in good shape.<br /><br />An entire chapter is devoted to how to take withdrawals for retirement, and the percentages to consider.  He also provides common sense tips on how to select an investment advisor. The next to last chapter provides readers with a 20-point summary action plan to get started.<br /><br />In conclusion, for investors who want to invest their hard-earned money on their own, this book provides a blueprint to achieve success, with all the steps necessary to build a solid, diversified portfolio. Merriman remains one of the top investing educators in the country, and has grown his money management firm to $700 million of assets under management. In summary, I highly recommend this book.in the country, and has grown his money management firm to $700 million of assets under management. In summary, I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-30

Everyone involved in investing in the stock market, mutual funds or separately managed accounts will glean useful information from this book.  Composed of 22 chapters and three appendices, this 300-page paperback covers the key basics of investing.<br /><br />This no-nonsense easy-to-read text explains the importance of determining your risk tolerance before you invest, understanding the difference between asset allocation and diversification so you don't make foolish mistakes, knowing how to determine your retirement income goals and capabilities, and investing for your children's education.<br /><br />Many investors do not have a clear idea of the riskiness of the stock market.  Perhaps after the the Nasdaq Composite Index  fell from 5048 in March 2000 to 1100 in October 2002, investors learned the hard way that risk really matters.  That is why one of the key discussion points that the authors hammer home is the comparison of investment risk vs. reward. The authors cover the risk-to-reward spectrum with numerical examples, the meaning of the efficient frontier, beta, and the standard deviation.  One chapter provides a blueprint of how to build a diversified portfolio in five easy steps.<br /><br />Additional chapters cover the basics of investing in active and passive mutual funds, their share classes, stocks, bonds, annuities,separate accounts and company stock options.  Also provided is a 17-page glossary of investment terms.<br /><br />If you have never invested in the stock market or have a minimal knowledge of how to play the game, then I highly recommend that your read this book before you place your hard-earned cash in the market so that the odds are in your favor.  You need at least a basic knowledge prior to investing, otherwise your may lost a large portion of your capital without realizing what happened to you, and that would be a shame.would be a shame. <br /> <br />	2004-08-19

In this book, Neal Frankle, CFP, provides investors with a clear and realistic picture of the investment landscape.  This 203-page book is composed of 10 chapters and four short appendices (24 book bibliography, how bonds, stocks and mutual funds work).<br /><br />Frankle is not swayed by the incessant flow of useless information from the financial media or the conventional wisdom on investing in espousing his investment principles.  For example, he believes that \\"asset allocation as a way to improve performance is a myth.\\" Furthermore, he states that buy-and-hold may be a terrific strategy for your broker and mutual funds, but not for individual investors.  He points out that asset allocation and buy-and-hold can lead to catastrophic losses. Investors must be educated to understand that being fully invested all the time is neither a riskless nor an intelligent strategy.  On the contrary, buy and hold can result in your investing portfolio being decimated as it may been in the crash of 2000-2002.<br /><br />Instead of hanging on every word of financial gurus and media stars, Frankel believes that investors should listen to what the market is actually doing and not what prognosticators are saying.<br /><br />Frankel puts forth a simple five-step plan for investors looking for an alternative less risky investment approach. Since mid-2001 he has personally used this approach to invest in ETFs and mutual funds.  One of his key points is to protect your assets in market downturns.  In brief, Frankel's 5-step process is as follows:<br /><br />1. Determine the overall market's health. He provides criteria for determining this in a separate chapter.  In essence, if the market is strong, then begin investing 25% of your capital in specific ETFs or mutual funds, depending upon your risk tolerance.<br /><br />2. Invest in the strongest of the four market segments (large and small cap growth and value).<br /><br />3. Select and invest in specific mutual funds, index funds and ETFs.  He suggests subscribing to the NoLoad  Fund*X service which ranks all no-load funds on performance.<br /><br />4. Invest in the market  over a six-week period, if it is a strong market.  Invest 25% the first week, and every 2 weeks thereafter until 100% of the funds are invested.<br /><br />5. Sell when your funds lag in a strong market or when the market itself loses strength.<br /><br />Overall, Frankle provides a penetrating look at the stock market from the eyes of a professional investment manager.  His goal of pointing out the important factors in achieving stock market success is accomplished.  This book should be in every investor's reading list, especially those just starting out or those who have no idea as to what the stock market is all about but continue to invest with poor results.arket segments (large and small cap growth and value).<br /><br />3.

The author presents the material in a logical, clearly written manner, and uses exhibits, as needed, to explain key financial concepts.  Also included in various chapters are key findings of the U.S. Trust Survey of Affluent Americans.  The survey focused on individuals with gross income of $300,000 and a net worth of $3.75 million. You will find the survey findings to be eye opening.  The appendix contains a sample of nine financial planning schedules.<br />The author indicates that the purpose of investing is to protect your wealth against inflation, and to preserve these invested assets.  Mastering the investment scene is not easy, and it takes years of studying, perseverance and a non-emotional approach.  Most individuals do not have sufficient time or skill to devote to their financial affairs.  Therefore, they should try to find a knowledgeable and TRUSTWORTHY advisor who can work with them to manage their wealth.  Having an advisor is especially important in the difficult periodic down markets, assuming the advisor knows how to protect your portfolio.<br />Maurer points out that an investor parking his/her funds in cash and not investing the funds is being too conservative and thus earning less than the rate of inflation.  Therefore, he suggests an investing plan be developed, tracked, and revised as necessary.<br />As in any field of endeavor, knowledge is power.  Without knowing the basics of the topics covered in this book, a person would be at a potential disadvantage, education-wise, in dealing with an advisor.  After reading this book, you will be able to more intelligently work with an advisor and understand how a successful relationship is supposed to work.<br />Any affluent individual should read this book before hiring a financial advisor/planner.

He focuses on having clear sales goals that translate into a specific income level, how to calculate what you need to earn an hour to reach your goal, analyzing your current skills set, and focusing on prospecting, planning your calls geographically, eliminating time wasting activities and then finally closing the sale.  This chapter alone can help an average salesperson achieve outstanding results without wasting valuable time focusing on non-productive tasks.<br />Overall, the author provides an easy-to-read no nonsense book on time management.  If you don't have time to read this book, then you are probably wasting time on stuff that is not moving you toward your financial and leisure goals.

Carlson's strategy is a twist to the Dogs of the Dow (DoD) strategy presented in Beating the Dow (1990) written by Michael O'Higgins.  O'Higgins selected the ten highest paying dividend stocks in the DJIA and bought them at year-end and held them for a year, and then bought the next batch of highest yielding stocks, etc.  That strategy did great in back-testing,  but has not done well in the past few years.<br />For the uninitiated, Carlson provides the historical basis of the DJIA and devotes an entire chapter to the DJIA components, developments, and changes in the index. At least one page is devoted to each stock in the index with complete information on its historical significance and business. Another chapter is devoted to counterpoint arguments against the naysayers of his strategy.<br />Carlson's strategy does not use dividend yield as his selection criteria, but instead focuses on those stock(s) that have the worst yearly percentage price performance.  He simply buys the DJIA stock(s) with the worst annual performance at the end of the year and holds it for one year, then he selects that year's worst performer and buys it, etc.  In addition to the one stock portfolio, Carlson also shows the comparative results using the worst performing 3-stock, 5-stock and 10-stock portfolios.  The 5- and 10-stock portfolios show the most consistent performance and have less risk than a one stock portfolio.<br />The book focuses on the performance of the worst 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-stock DJIA portfolios, and provides statistical information showing how these different stock strategies compared to the DJIA annually since 1931 (using back-testing) on a dollar-term, percentage, annual return, and percentage difference from its 200 day moving average basis.  He also provided comparative results for last 30 year,  20 year, 10 year and 5 year periods. In addition, there is as 37-page appendix containing the performance of each DJIA stock since 1931 as far as annual performance change, the DJIA annual change, and the performance of each of his stock strategies in each of the years.<br />In a separate chapter, he even compares his strategies with the Dogs of the Dow and indicates their superiority over the DoD since 1999.  The performance before that time showed mixed results depending upon which of Carlson's strategies are used.<br />Overall, the author presents a credible case for considering his DJIA strategies.  He warns investors that they should only invest a portion of their money in any of these strategies, and to be sure to have a diversified portfolio overall to be successful. This book offers investors a mechanical stock selection process that takes the emotion out the investment equation.

Books	4	13	13	N	N	Easy to Understand Approach to Tracking Market�s Movements	Professor Peter Navarro teaches at the University of California (Irvine) and has written an interesting workbook on the \\"macro-investing\\" method.  It focuses on getting a handle on the big picture.<br />As a teacher, Navarro firmly believes that learning involves not only reading material,  but also understanding it which can be assessed by  using  pertinent questions and exercises.  That is why he places questions and exercises after each of his 20 chapters, and provides the answers in a separate 25-page section at the end of the book. This is an excellent  reinforcement approach which more books should follow, especially those that are more dense.<br />Navarro puts forth his three key macro-investing rules:<br />1. buy strong stocks in strong sectors in markets<br />2. short weak stocks in weak sectors in declining markets<br />3. stay in cash in a trendless market<br />He warns investors that even buying the best stock in the wrong sector in a down market is suicide. According to Navarro, eighty percent of investors lost one-half of their money in the 2000-2002 bear market.  Therefore, he urges investors to be on the lookout for macro-economic events, what he refers to as \\"macrowaves\\" that precede market action.  These include such items as government reports on inflation, employment, growth, Fed policy changes, and large company earnings.  He believes this news drives markets up and down.<br />In multiple chapters, Navarro explains the four steps of macrowave investing and the three key cycles (business, interest rate, and stock market) and which stock sectors would be best to invest in during each aspect of the cycles.<br />One chapter explains the yield curve and how to use it to understand the changes in stocks can bonds.  He then reviews the basics in selecting strong and weak stocks, as well as the basics of fundamental and technical analysis in back-to-back chapters.  Additional chapters are devoted to risk management, money management, trade management, and execution.<br />Overall, Navarro has delivered a solid primer on preparing yourself for trading the market's large moves.  The logical step-by-step approach is easy to follow and will provide investors with a good understanding of the markets, and hopefully will result in better investment results.cution.<br />Overall, Navarro has delivered a solid primer on preparing yourself for trading the market's large moves.

Also addressed are the random walk theory, elasticity trading (based on recent pre-established price levels), managing uncertainty, elasticity rules, and tactics and tips.<br />An entire chapter is devoted to \\"Market Symmetry\\" which are specific harmonious market patterns. The four stages of the business cycle (contraction, trough, expansion, and peak) are compared to the stock market's four stages (accumulation, markup, distribution, and decline).  Fibonacci levels are explained in the context of finding price patterns.  Numerous charts illustrate all the points being made.<br />Technical analysis is briefly reviewed in a separate chapter.  Here there is a discussion of accumulation and distribution, support and resistance, daily, hourly and ten-minute charts, trends, volume, and moving averages.  Plentiful graphic examples are provided to bring home the concepts.<br />Section two is the heart of the book and contains strategies, as well as the actual techniques that the authors currently use and teach others to swing trade the markets. Favorite indicators explained with charts include: RSI, TRIN, Directional Movement, true range, ADX, and stochastics with divergences.<br />Moving averages are described in detail in a separate chapter.  Topics covered include simple moving averages, moving average crossovers, stops, and MACD.  Other chapter cover momentum trading, use of Level II screens, reading the tape, trading volatility, rules and strategies for NYSE stocks, trading financial futures, systems and pair trading, seasonal trading and tax loss selling, and risk management strategies.<br />Those individuals who plan to swing trade should read this solid addition to the trading literature before risking a penny of their money.made.<br />Technical analysis is briefly reviewed in a separate chapter.

It is one of the simplest and best expositions on the subject that I've come across.  Although its title suggests that it was written solely for teenage investors, it could have been easily titled  \\"Everybody's Guide to Investing\\".  A 13-year old precocious investor, Timothy Olsen, wrote the book.  Interestingly, the writing style, subject knowledge, and comprehensive coverage of the topic appears to be written by a much more experienced professional investor. Congratulations to Timothy on mastering a complex subject and explaining it so simply.<br />This book is suited for anyone who desires a quick and basic overview of stock market investing.  It is perfectly suited for novices who have no idea about this intriguing and vital subject.  Unfortunately, the high schools in this country do not spend much time, if any, on the basics of investing and savings.  This book should certainly be recommended as supplementary reading by high school Economic classes.  In addition to the stock market basics, other topics covered include mutual funds, index funds and bonds.  The author also explains how difficult it is to beat the market, why market timing is not a good idea, and why selecting mutual funds with low expenses is critical.  He then covers issues of trust with regard to analysts, brokers and financial planners.  Also discussed are how to research stocks and the importance of asset allocation.<br />The book does not cover most subjects in great depth - as this is only a primer - but provides the basic tenets needed to understand the key investing concepts. Two shortfalls of the book are its lack of website addresses and bibliography.  For example, there were several references to John Bogle (Former Vanguard Chairman) on pages 105 and 169 in wonderful sidebar notes.  It would have been great if the Website of Bogle's speeches or titles of his books were included.  (That site is:  ........  Another example where Websites were lacking were when the author refers to index funds and exchange-traded funds. (Those sites are indexfunds.com, etfconnect.com, ishares.com, etc.)<br />If you have teenage children and you want them to learn about the stock market with a quick and enjoyable immersion in the subject matter, then I highly recommend this book.  The future investors in America's capitalist system need to know what it's all about, and this book provides solid information and a head start on the investing journey.luded.

However, the author provides straightforward advice that can help individuals get and stay focused on the right track so that they can accomplish their retirement dreams.<br />Most individuals have not really thought about all aspects of the retirement process and have let the chips fall where they may.  The devastating bear market of 2000-2002, unfortunately changed the retirement landscape for millions of individuals whose retirements have been postponed and many potential retirees have been forced to keep working to make ends meet. The reason for this was that most individuals did not understand or consider the risks of investing in the stock market.<br />By reading, studying, and implementing the wisdom in this book, readers will put the odds in their favor to obtain a secure and peaceful retirement.

A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition) (Collins Business Essentials)	Books	5	1112	1149	N	N	Classic Investment Book Enhanced for Today�s Investors	When I first came across the first edition of this book in my local library in 1959, I was a teenager.  Back in those days there were only a handful of books about the stock market.  And I've read all of them during my junior high and high school years.<br />This latest updated 623-page paperback (the index alone is 33 pages) version updated by Jason Zweig is a welcome addition to this classic.  The original chapters are intact, but with footnoted comments by Zweig. Moreover, he provides his own commentary on each chapter contents in a separate chapter following each original chapter.  He provides extensive research, charts, tables and commentary that updates the book to the present years.  He is not afraid to take on the big guns of Wall Street and show how wrong they were in some of their extremely bullish predictions during January-March 2000, when the market was at its peak.<br />The first nine chapters cover investing basics that all investors could benefit from.  There are many truisms spouted on Wall Street that are not really true.  These chapters provide the investor with a realistic picture of how Wall Street works and what investors need to do to come out ahead.<br /> Chapters 10-20 focus strictly on fundamental analysis, stock selection, convertible issues and warrants, and other subjects.  Investors who plan to invest directly in stocks should make sure to read these chapters.  However, for readers more interested in investing in mutual funds, and in particular index funds, they need not concern themselves with all the detail in these chapters unless they have the time or interest in the subject matter presented.<br />In conclusion, the combination of pioneer Ben Graham?s original work coupled with Zweig?s meticulous and enjoyable update, make this a remarkable book about investments and investor behavior that every new and experienced investor should read.  Of the 500 investing books that I?ve read, this one certainly is one of the greats of all time.	2003-08-11

Therefore, it is not surprising that this book methodically covers the principal payment systems (checks, ACHs, wires and global transfer systems - CHIPS and SWIFT), their basic workings, risk, and how to manage those risks. The subject matter of this book is critical for corporate financial managers - CFOs, Treasurers, Cash Managers, Controllers - as well as bank operations officers, and bank and corporate auditors.<br />Since check fraud is currently a $10 billion a year problem an entire chapter is devoted to checks, their characteristics, the prevailing regulations, the risk parameters, and how to manage that risk including using internal controls, bank controls, check stock controls, and positive pay controls.  The authors warn corporations that they should be alert to \\"gross negligence and willful conduct clauses\\" in bank agreements which may put undue and unnecessary risk on them.<br />Wire transfer, defined to include FedWire, CHIPS and SWIFT, are covered in two chapters.  The first chapter covers the transfer from the originating bank to the receiving bank.  The next topics reviewed include: liability for fraudulent transfers, managing risks in the links of the wire systems, and the bank's perspective on wire transfer risk.  The second chapter on wire transfers focuses on completing the transfer and the rules for handing errors.<br />The Automated Clearing House (ACH), the second type of electronic funds transfer, in addition to wires, is covered in a separate chapter.  A basic discussion of this payment type is provided along with a definition of the types of ACHs and how they are processed.  The ACH origination process is covered and the warranties and liabilities of the originating bank are examined.<br />Other topics reviewed in this section include ACH prenotification, reversal of duplicate and erroneous payments.  The authors then examine the receipt of entries, returns, change and acknowledgements.  Lastly, settlement and accountability, cross-border payments, US Government payments, and ACH payment system risks are reviewed.<br />[In light of the recent coverage in an August 2003 issue of the American Banker newspaper, corporate treasury managers should make sure that they setup special ACH debit blocks on their bank accounts to reduce the risk of ACH fraud.]<br />An entire chapter is devoted to Electronic Commerce and Internet payments.  Corporate financial managers are well advised to bone up on this material to ensure that they protect their corporate assets from potential fraud in these two exploding areas.

Unlike most guests he consistently provides useful down-to-earth advice to viewers.  He has come to the realization that blind buy-and-hold investing is no longer a valid approach.  He now believes \\"that radical market fluctuations sometimes demand radical action...there are not only times when you shouldn't buy and hold funds, but also times when you'll need to adjust your allocation.\\"  It's refreshing to hear the \\"truth\\" about buy and hold from an investment professional rather than get the party line from the always-bullish Wall Street crowd.<br />Hayden's book, his first, hits the nail on the head and clearly delineates a ten-step investing plan, each of which is explained in a separate chapter.  His ten principles include:<br />- Don't Lose Your Principal<br />- Set Your Own Benchmark<br />- Buy and Watch Your Portfolio<br />- Have an Investing Defense and Offense<br />- Consider Risk And Return<br />- Keep Learning<br />- Avoid Sector Funds<br />- Track Your Performance<br />- Be a Professional or Get One<br />He methodically leads the reader through the key steps needed to become a successful investor.  Hayden supplements his advice with appropriate exhibits to emphasis his key points.<br />In conclusion, Hayden has written a comprehensive, step-by-step investing approach that can greatly benefit serious investors - if they not only read his book but also actually do what he says.  Over the past 40 years I've read over 500 books on investing, and this one makes my \\"top 10\\" list for its practical advice.  I urge you to read this book and benefit from the wisdom of a \\"true\\" Wall Street\\" professional.	2003-08-11

I attended one of his Nison's candlestick workshops at an investor expo, as well as reviewed his video and found them to be excellent educational vehicles.<br />This book is for those individuals who like to read about certain candlestick characteristics, and then test themselves on their level of understanding.  Each chapter begins with a bullet-pointed list of learning objectives and key terms to watch for.  It then explains the concept, shows examples, provides highlighted key points, and then provides review questions, and detailed answers. In most all of the chapters, the review questions and answers take up more pages than the explanation of the candlestick pattern or the concept being taught.  So, this is more of an instructional and teacher-student approach to the subject.<br />One chapter entitled \\"Progressive Charting\\" is about 50 pages long and contains a walk-through of an unfolding market scenario, a few candles at a time using 88 annotated charts. The purpose of this approach is to help the reader interpret each candle or pattern in a real market situation and learn from his/her experience.<br />The last chapter entitled \\"Bringing It Altogether\\" asks you 42 questions about candlestick charting and provides the detailed answers.  This allows the reader to determine his/her level of understanding and areas for further study. The book contains a short \\"visual\\" glossary illustrating candlestick patterns.<br />For readers who are avid students and like to work through numerous exercises and examples of the basics of candlesticks, this book will serve their needs well.  For other investors who want more \\"meat\\" and detailed information and explanation, then I would recommend Nison's \\"Beyond Candlesticks\\" instead.ead.	2003-08-08

With over a quarter century of experience, Williams has provided investors with practical and easy-to-implement market timing and stock selection strategies in this just published book.<br />Williams initially focuses on the recurrent seasonal patterns in the market.  Williams reveals one interesting strategy where he notes that excellent times to go long the market are years ending in twos (e.g., 1952, 1962 ...... 1992) and threes. Just look at charts in those years or view them in this book to see those excellent buying points.<br />Williams also covers the best years of each decade to invest - fifth, eighth and ninth years.  The consistency of these three years performance is 80%(positive returns in 8 out of 10 of those decade years).  Next he covers the four-year cycle from 1858 to the present time (last 4-yr cycle years were 1994, 1998, 2002) showing that they were good times to buy at their yearly lows, many times occurring in the September/October timeframe.<br />Another strategy Williams covers in buying in October and selling in April.  This strategy was offered by Stock Trader's Almanac in 1986 developed by Yale Hirsch, and it still works today. This strategy has produced significant returns while reducing risk as investors are out of the market for half the year.<br />Williams provides a look at indicators to determine that a market bottom is in place.  He covers such items as the Fed's Stock Evaluation Model, margin credit, odd-lot short sales, Investors Intelligence Bull/Bear Index, US Bonds, and gold prices.<br />Williams covers in detail the fallacy of long-term investing and the devastation that it can wreak on investors portfolios.  Investors who are die-hard \\"buy-and-holders\\" should read this chapter to learn that to use that strategy is dangerous.<br />To do well in the market, Williams urges investors to find stocks that have the capability to outperform the market, and then find the best time to buy them.  He totally disagrees with the Wall Street cognoscenti that market-timing is useless.<br />He spends a chapter on buying stocks at a discount, and one on measuring investor sentiment on individual stocks.  He lists seven traditional measures of value (e.g., P/E ratio, Price/Book) and elucidates on which ones work best.<br />All-in-all this well-written, easy to understand book provides investors with a systematic, time-tested approach to investing.

Books	2	30	38	N	N	This Is A Book About Value Investing Not Market Timing	Although the book's title leads one to believe that this book is about market timing, it is not. It is basically the buy and hold approach with a few twists.  This book will not help the average investor time the market, since buy and sell signals may not occur for years.  In the interim their portfolios can get decimated.<br />The premise of the book and statistical tables provided in the book are all very interesting, and are food for thought. And the writing style is easy to read. But in the end the value to this approach to today's investor is dubious.<br />The authors use a 15-year moving average with monthly prices of the S&amp;P 500 Index (pg. 27) going back 100 years to generate buy and sell signals. The last buy signal according to this chart was given in late 1984 to early 1985 with the S&amp;P near 325. So investors would have been invested for the last 18 years.<br />They would have had to sit through the debacle of October 1987, and the drops in 1990, 1994, and the terrible markets during the past three years.  The S&amp;P 500 Index peaked at 1527.46 on March 4, 2000, and dropped to 776.76 on October 9, 2002. Thus, investors would still be holding their investments using Stein and DeMuth's approach. As of June 26, 2003 the S&amp;P was at 986. If you looked at their S&amp;P chart with the 15-year moving average, you would see that a sell signal would not occur until the S&amp;P drops below 800. Having such a slow moving average does not allow an investor to take profits at market highs.  Moreover, who in the right mind wants to give back a large percentage of the profits.<br />The authors main thesis is that by using specific fundamental data - metrics - as they call them, either individually or with better results in combination, the investor can be long the market during uptrends and in cash or equivalents during down trends.<br />They provide statistical information on using fundamental analysis measurements - arrayed from high to low values-to ascertain whether the stock market is overvalued and undervalued.  The measurements presented in this book include:<br />· Dividend yield<br />· P/E ratio<br />· Tobin's Q (measure of fundamental value)<br />· Price-to-sales ratio<br />· Price-to-cashflow ratio<br />· Bond yields<br />Each of the measurements mentioned above is discussed in a separate chapter showing the performance of investing with that strategy from 1902 - 2001, when the measurement was at a high and low reading.  Performance of each metric is shown for 5-, 10-, 1-5 and 20-year periods from each year.  Typcially when the market is undervalued according to that metric, the performance in those just mentioned time periods is superior to the  years when the market is designated as overvalued.<br />Also, included was a comparison of lump-sum investing vs. dollar-cost averaging. Most of these measurements are shown in monthly line chart with a 15-YEAR moving average imposed on them.  Interestingly the buy and sell signals - crosses above and below the moving average- of all these measurements are infrequent and occur around the same time.<br />Overall this book should be of interest to value investors with very long time horizons.

Cycles and Patterns in Indexes<br />Volume II. Geocosmic Correlations to Investment Cycles<br />Volume III. Geocosmic Correlations to Trading Cycles<br />Volume IV. Solar/Lunar Correlations to Short-Term Trading Reversals<br />Volume V. Technical Tools and Trading Cycles (not yet completed)<br />As is the case with his previous volumes II and III, the reader unfamiliar with astrology will have difficulty in understanding the book. Many of the astrological terms are neither clearly defined, nor explained as to their importance. Those readers familiar with astrology will have no such problems.  Readers unfamiliar with astrology and the financial markets, should first read Merriman's 60-page basic primer \\"Basic Principles of Geocosmic Studies for Financial Market Timing.\\"<br />Volume IV is a 241-page paperback (8.5\\" x 11\\"). Very few researchers and market analysts have the stamina, knowledge, time, and skill to write one ground-breaking book on the markets.  Merriman has accomplished that feat four times over, and he is not done yet, with a fifth volume underway.<br />As I expected, Merriman has produced exhaustive research on the correlation of geocosmic signatures with high and low points in three equities markets. The book's hypothesis is that short-term traders can take advantage of specific reversal dates during the year that can be identified by using specific solar/lunar combinations. Most researchers who have found statistically valid correlations of data to stock prices that can be used for profitable trading, tend to keep it to themselves, and not share it with the public.  Merriman has taken the opposite road and shares his years of research with all of us.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon us (short-term traders) to give his findings serious consideration.  Any edge that we can get in the markets is something that should be examined and put to the test.<br />Merriman's reviews 60 years of DJIA price data coupled with all the Sun-Moon combinations.  He also reviews similar combinations with almost two decades of data for the Nasdaq composite and the Japanese Nikkei index. He focuses on determining the important reversal dates ( one or three day time bands a few times a year) - 4% or more changes in value -- for specific Sun-Moon combinations.  Traders can get ready to act on these reversal points with minimal risk.  Traders who use the QQQs, SPYs, and DIAs, as well as futures and options can benefit from Merriman's identification of these timeframes.<br />Merriman found that certain lunar cycles and certain Sun-Moon signs correlate consistently with tradable highs and lows in the financial markets, and identifies them. At the end of the book, Merriman has a chapter devoted to a short-term trading methodology that clearly spells out the 16 steps required to take advantage of the key reversal dates. He covers a few intraday technical indicators with his 16-step methodology, and then shows a detailed example.<br />In summary, this book is another significant contribution in the area of timing the market -with specific emphasis on using solar/lunar correlations to identify high probability key reversal dates. For those readers with a solid understanding of these subject areas, the usefulness of this book is apparent. For other readers who feel that the material presented is useful, but cannot fully understand it to use it, then consider Merriman's other services that include newsletters, seminars, software, annual forecasts and reports ... In conclusion, Merriman continues to add significant value to short-term trader's ability to profit from identifiable and profitable market situations.

If you are beginning investor or trader then you may want to wait a bit until you've mastered you chart patterns and terminology before delving into this book.  If you like statistical data and like to work with numbers, then this book will make you happy.  Each chapter on the chart patterns follow a similar template so that you know what to expect in future chapters as far as format is concerned.<br />The book is divided into two parts.  Part I (85 pages) presents new research on trendlines, support and resistance, placing stops, selling considerations, and common trading mistakes. Part II (about 300 pages) reviews in detail 14 chart patterns (market tops and bottoms, head-and-shoulders, rectangles, triangles and scallops - rounded bottoms).  Bulkowski also provided a 19-page summary of the bullish and bearish patterns with their performance statistics.  Also included is a 9-page glossary and the methodology used to determine the statistics for each pattern.<br />To give you  flavor as to one of Bulkowski's findings, consider the most bullish trading patterns. He found the best performance  was the descending triangle pattern with an upside breakout.  He found the average rise after the breakout for a short-term pattern was 49%.  The next best was breakouts from an intermediate-term rectangle pattern with a 42% average rise. And long-term triple bottoms can in third with a return of 41% after breaking out<br />He looked at the most popular patterns and found the characteristics that make them tick.<br />Bulkowski developed a chart pattern scoring system that helps select better performing chart patterns to trade.  Scores above zero infer that the pattern will most likely beat the median, while scores below the median infer that the pattern will be a non-performer.  Bulkowski also includes a few case studies for each pattern to aid in the understanding of the patterns and scoring system.<br />Bulkowski suggests that you use the information in the book on the behavior of chart patterns with the scoring system, combined with your own research (such as how the industry group is behaving) and other technical and fundamental indicators to develop your own trading strategy.<br />Overall, Bulkowski presents a masterful text on the most-often used chart patterns.  But instead of giving you generalities, he provides specifics based upon detailed statistical analysis.  Knowing which patterns work best under which conditions will certainly put the odds of investment success in your favor.  Therefore, I highly recommend this book to serious students of the market.

It is divided into 10 chapters and includes a 15-page appendix of on-line investing resources, and 100 useful Websites, as well as a 9-page glossary.  One unique feature is the inclusion of Psychological Quotient (PQ) Charts that can help readers ascertain their investment style and, thereby increase their odds on selecting the most appropriate investments.<br />The authors put forth the theory that if an investing strategy does not fit a person's personality that he/she will not stick with it for very long.  Therefore, they provide a selection of currently used investing strategies together with the personality traits needed to execute the strategy successfully.<br />According to the authors, the investing process encompasses stock selection, timing of entry and exit points and portfolio management (asset allocation, number of holdings). However, they point out that the strategies for picking investment vehicles depends upon the investor's style of investing.<br />The authors point out that if an investor can use a systematic investing approach while maintaining discipline that he can more than double the annual return compared to random investing.<br />The authors created PQ charts.  They rate each investment style on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of ten personality traits.  These traits are: discipline; patience; risk tolerance; reward expectation; volatility tolerance; time horizon; time commitment; quantitative skill; charting skill; and investing confidence.<br />Nine specific investment styles are reviewed.  The four major styles are growth (high risk/high reward); value (hunting for bargains); momentum (where the action is); and technical investing (using charts).  There is one chapter on each style and together they cover 100 pages and are the heart of the book.<br />Each chapter follows the same format by providing the PQ chart personality rankings, anatomy of the types of stocks that fit that category, chart patterns of these stocks, how to screen for stocks, checklist of questions on evaluating stocks, exit and entry strategies, portfolio strategy, a case study, stock chart evaluation checklist, on-line resources, and helpful hints.<br />Five minor investing styles are portrayed in a separate chapter. They include: fundamental investing (balance sheet review), income investing (dividend payers), hybrid investing (combining styles), active trading (day traders, swing traders, position traders), and style surfing (style now in vogue).<br />Also provided are market capitalization strategies.  Those covered include: large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap strategies. A few advanced strategies are briefly discussed.  They include short-selling, market-neutral investing, index trading, option hedging, and global investing.<br />Each style is explained and a PQ chart is included. A table showing the names of specific index funds and ETFs is also included for each investing style or market cap.  This table provides readers with the specific funds to consider based upon their investment profile.<br />Overall, this book provides readers with a crisply written introduction to understanding the different investing styles, determining their style, help in locating funds that track these styles.

US	52626413	R1PLTW858JLKZ0	0471265799	551319681	Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know	Books	3	53	63	N	N	Basics of No-Load Mutual Fund Investing for Beginners	Jack Brennan, CEO and Chairman of the Vanguard Group (2nd largest mutual fund company), has penned his first book and has provided investors with an easy-to-read style on investment basics. Brennan has a long way to go to catch up to his predecessor -- Jack Bogle, the index fund guru and prolific author .  Not one of Bogle's books was included in Brennan's recommended reading list, which is surprising, since they are classics.<br />This 239-page book is divided into four parts and 22 chapters. Part I focuses on mastering the basics.  Brennan urges investors to first do their homework (learn about stocks, bonds and cash; where to invest -- bank, mutual fund or broker; understand risk; and know yourself as an investor.<br />Next, he tells investors to develop good habits (saving money, buy-and-holding investments, don't keep score too often).  He warns investors to be skeptical and avoid investment fads like the Nifty-Fifty (popular in the 1970s) and the Dot.coms of the 1990s.  Lastly, he recommends that investors continue their investment learning process and become aware of new opportunities.<br />Brennan then counsels investors to trust themselves, the financial markets, and to find a trustworthy financial services firm.  He pushes compounding as a way to build wealth.<br />According to the author, developing a financial plan including current and future financial needs is important. He covers college savings vehicles, saving for retirement, how to handle debts, and the use of margin.  Additionally, Brennan expounds on the benefits of dollar cost averaging and using automatic monthly investments plans, as well as stuffing money in tax-deferred retirement plans.<br />In Part II, he shows how to construct a realistic portfolio using diversification and the balanced portfolio approach.  He illustrates the typical returns from 1926 - 2000 with different portfolio allocations of stocks and bonds.  These portfolios provide returns ranging from 6.2% to 10.7%, from the least to most aggressive.<br />Not surprisingly, Brennan recommends mutual funds as the best way to diversify.  He goes into a discussion of how mutual funds work, their advantages, and a few caveats (yes, you can lose money).  He then provides guidance on how to select the appropriate mutual fund using a 4-step approach.  Next up is a discussion of the costs associated with mutual funds (loads, 12b-1 fees, taxes, etc.).  He provides a table depicting the value of various hypothetical funds using different costs for each and how costs play a big role in the final value of the funds over time.<br />The most important chapter in Part II is the one on risk.  Most investors do not understand the implications of neglecting to take into account the riskiness of their investments.  Brennan defines investment risk, duration, volatility, risk tolerance, and how to manage risk.<br />Part III focuses on managing your funds with focus and discipline.  He explains style boxes (similar to Morningstar's style boxes) and how funds are classified into one of nine boxes arranged by market cap size (small, medium and large) and style (value, blend, growth).<br />Brennan then attempts to make the case for buy-and-hold as a solid investment strategy.  He indicates that frequent trading and market timing don't work.  He says, \\"my advice is to forget market timing and let time, and compounding, do the magic.\\"  He illustrates how missing the \\"best\\" months greatly reduces an investor's overall performance from 1992 - 2001.  But he neglects to mention that missing the \\"worst\\" months provides a higher performance than missing the worst months.<br />Investors who got killed in the market crash from 2000- 2002, the worst since 1929, by sticking with their stocks or mutual funds, and especially those who kept dollar-cost averaging down, probably don't agree with Brennan on the benefit of buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging.  I strongly believe that market timing with the right tools and strategies can beat buy-and-hold with less risk, but this is not the format to make the case.<br />A chapter entitled \\"Time is Everything\\" makes the case for accumulating wealth by making systematic investments in retirement accounts.  Brennan illustrates the value of compounding, and why investors should start investing at a young age.  He also shows the range of returns of the S&P 500 from 1972-2001 for various rolling holding periods (1, 5, 10, and 20 years) and concludes that all 10-year or longer rolling periods produced positive returns.  He urges investors to tune-up and rebalance their portfolios to retain the proper allocation among investment classes.<br />Part IV starts with a discussion of the history of financial bubbles, and then goes into how to recognize a bubble, and how to protect yourself from speculative bubbles. Brennan urges investors not to follow the crowd, not to become greedy, and not to chase hot sectors.  Above all, he cautions investors to beware of themselves -- since they may be there worst enemies because of their behavior.  Overconfidence, focusing too much on the short-term losses, feeling compelled not to stay on the sidelines all can lead to financial disaster.<br />One chapter focuses on bear markets.  Brennan reviews their length since 1956.  He points out that a diversified portfolio of 60% stocks/40% bonds had lost only $29,000 out of $100,000 in the 1973-1974 bear market compared to a loss of $48,000 invested 100% in stocks.  He offers the following tips for handling bear markets:<br />- continue to use dollar-cost averaging<br />- maintain long-term perspective<br />- make small shifts in portfolio allocation<br />- have realistic expectations<br />He says, \\".....people who are investing regularly for a long-term goal-- not those drawing on their investments -- bear markets are good things.  If you are investing for retirement, and retirement is decades away, a decline in you account is not a \\"real\\" loss\\".  Oh really!! Tell that to the millions who have lost a large chunk of their retirement money in this cruel crash by following the conventional wisdom.<br />In conclusion, I felt that Brennan offers many useful insights for novice investors to contemplate, especially on the importance of using diversified no-load mutual funds.  The book is well written, easy-to-understand and offers down-to-earth advice.  His discussion of buy-and-hold is weak and flawed and that's the weakest part of the book.egies can beat buy-and-hold with less risk, but this is not the format to make the case.<br />A chapter entitled \\"Time is Everything\\" makes the case for accumulating wealth by making systematic investments in retirement accounts.

Quite the contrary, it requires the reader to spend considerable time and effort to absorb and learn the methodology and principles provided by Mark Fisher, a master trader and teacher.<br />Over the last 15 years, Fisher, an independent trader, has taught his trading approach dubbed the \\"ACD\\" system to over 4,000 individuals including members of his clearing firm - which is the largest clearing firm for the NY Mercantile Exchange.  Of the 1,000 traders who use Fisher's methodology, 10% make over $750,000 a year, according to Fisher.  This is certainly a testament to the soundness of Fisher's methodology.  Fisher emphasizes that is method can be used to trade commodities, currencies, or stocks either at a trading firm, on the exchange floor, or at home.  Traders taught by Fisher have had a 40 - 50% success rate compared to around 10 - 15% for the average trader using different techniques/<br />Fisher peppers his books with examples, anecdotes and stories.  However, the main thrust is focused on explaining his ACD system in excruciating detail with numerous chart examples, detailed explanations of the key terms and trading parameters.<br />The ACD system - plotting price points in relation to the opening range - requires no expensive software.  The method provides reference points for trading - A and C points are for entry and B and D are stops.  Using the system the trader can calculate when to go long or short.  Coupled with additional indicator and measurements, layered on top of the ACD system, the trader will be able to develop a trading plan.<br />To use the ACD system -which is based on simple math - the trader must have certain abilities including collect and analyze information, make and implement decisions, be good with numbers, be disciplined to follow the system. Fisher describes pivot points, the daily pivot price (high+low+close)/3), daily pivot range, 3-day rolling pivot, etc.  The last 30 days data are viewed to obtain the big picture of the vehicle being traded.  He calls this his Macro ACD.  He provides 25 chart examples to illustrate how to score each day.<br />After the first four chapters, Fisher has an exam with answers to make sure that the reader understands all the key concepts and calculations.<br />Fisher adds more meat to the ACD system by introducing the use of pivot moving average (using daily pivot price as opposes to the day's close) to determine the current trend (up, down or flat).  He uses three pivot point moving averages (14 day, 30 day and 50 day) and focuses on looking at the slope of the moving average line to determine the existing trend or rate of change in the trend.  Then Fisher covers exit strategies.  He explains the rolling pivot range (RPR) which typically spans 3 to 6 trading days.  This is the reference point for entry of the trade.  The RPR let's you keep your winning position longer and gets you out of your losing positions in a more profitable manner.  Fisher also calculates the price momentum of today's close compared to 8 days ago to determine the trend.  He then discusses his use of the \\"reversal\\" trade set-up to exploit the market failures.  Other subjects covered include the two-way swing, trend reversal trade and sushi roll (change in the direction of the market), and outside reversal week.<br />Fisher illustrates the effectiveness of using the ACD system using charts from the 1929 crash.  It would have worked well in 1929 at the top and in 1932 at the market bottom in keeping the trader on the right side of the market.<br />Fisher devotes on 27-page chapter to real person trading stories focusing on risk management.  Lastly, Fisher interviews seven traders that have successfully used his system with their personal perspectives.<br />The book contains a 10-page glossary of relevant terms, a table of 20 simple trading rules, and a 27-page compilation of sample data gathering for the ACD system.<br />In summary, this book requires a lot of time and study from the reader, but the potential rewards could be substantialook requires a lot of time and study from the reader, but the potential rewards could be substantial	2002-08-18

This is Prechters third and latest book (At the Crest of the Tidal Wave (1995) and The Elliott Wave Principle (1978)).  His current book is really two books in one printed on different colored paper!  Even if you do not agree with Prechters view of the world, you should certainly understand his arguments and make your own decisions.<br />Part I (135 pp.) focuses on why he believes a stock market crash will occur in the near term, as well why deflation and economic depression are high probability scenarios. Although deflation and depression are rare occurrences, Prechter believes that they are at the brink.  His goal is writing the book is to provide insight into defining both events and make you believe that they can happen, and eventually make you believe that they are likely to happen.<br />Prechter compares the period 1942-1966 (called Wave III) with the economic expansion of 1974-2000 (Wave V).  He points out that the most recent period had much weaker economic fundamentals and performance than the prior period, although by stock market standards Wave V had an increase of 1930% on the DJIA compared to 971% during Wave III.  In his analysis he provides comprehensive statistics on GDP, Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, Unemployment rate, households liquid assets, federal and consumer debt, prime rate, federal budget deficit, personal savings among others.  Prechter then defines depression and its relationship to the stock market.  One of his key observations is that major stock market declines lead directly to depressions.<br />Prechter depicts the five waves evident in the stock market using four charts.  He points out that the five-wave pattern occurs even taking into account major news events such as Hitlers rise to power and the end of the Vietnam war.  Prechter provides four signs of a market top and explains the Elliott Wave characteristics of each of the five waves.<br />Prechter presents his case for the existing stock market precarious situation (as of March 2002) by covering Wave V in great detail.  He spends considerable time examining the fifth wave from 1974 to 2000 compared to previous waves.  The case for the historically high stock evaluation is made by focusing on the low dividend yield, outrageously high book value, and high P/E ratio.  Prechter then covers how psychology plays a major role in a stock market advance and decline.  He reviews the psychology of he economists, brokerage strategists, money managers, public, and the media.<br />Prechter believes that the upcoming bear market will be the most devastating since the great depression and perhaps since 1720-1784.  If this occurs, he indicates that the U.S. will experience another depression.  He forecasts that the DJI will plummet to 777, the August 1982 low, if that average follows the pattern of the prior manias (e.g., Nikkei; DJI 1929-32; Gouda tulip bulbs (1634-1722); and the South Sea Company (1719-1722)).  Lastly, he makes the case for deflation, and discusses the Fed and banking system.<br />Book Two provided Prechters advice for protecting yourself and profiting from the upcoming depression.  His recommendations include:<br />1. Have safety of principal by being in cash or high-quality short-term U.S. Government treasuries (T-bills) or money market mutual funds that invest in these types of instruments.<br />2. Sell your home (if you have a large mortgage) and rent instead.<br />3. Find a safe bank (using Weiss Ratings, Inc., for example) and keep your money there.<br />4. Do not own or invest in stocks, options or futures.<br />5. Consider buying inverse mutual funds (such as Rydex Tempest that double short the S&P 500) and Rydex Venture (double short NASDAQ 100). ProFunds also offers bear funds.  To invest in any of these funds, Prechter cautions that you must be a short-term timer to be successful.<br />6. Buy physical gold and silver metals.<br />7. Cash out your whole life insurance policies and convert to term insurance from the safest firms (based on Weiss Ratings, Inc., for example)<br />Prechter provides a very sobering view of the future that few individuals will heed because of its negative and extreme consequences.  But if this book makes you think about the safety of your financial nest eggs, retirement funds, insurance policies, etc; then at least you can decide to take some steps to protect yourself.  If the stock market can manage to rally 20-40% from the lows of July 2002, then perhaps you should consider cashing in your remaining equity and mutual funds positions before the real bear market takes hold as Prechter envisions.  I know I will be doing that and then using my charts and technical indicators to tell me when to get back in.  Its shame that Prechter did not publish this book in March 2000 when the market was at its peak. He would have saved most investors, who believed his work, a great deal of money if they had followed his recommendations.<br />Whether you agree with Prechters view of the world, you will certainly agree with this quote:<br />To be successful in life, or at least learn something along the way, you have to think for yourself.mer to be successful.<BR>6.

Armstrong does not provide earth shattering revelations or trade secrets of the markets, but does provide a methodical way of evaluating your investment needs and then showing you how to put together a practical mutual fund-type diversified portfolio.<br />Most individual investors have no game plan or written investment goals.  They may have a lofty goal of obtaining 10 - 20% annual returns over the long-term.  Now that we've experienced a significant bear market-which may get worse - the investor needs to sit down and realistically assess his/her financial needs and use a time-tested investing approach.<br />Armstrong's book offers a systematic approach to understanding the investment scene.  He covers long-term trends and returns in the various investment categories from 1926 - 2000 and shows that stocks were the way to go - especially small company stocks.  He then provides a 32-page informative discussion on assessing the risk of investing - a subject that many investors don't know too much about.  Unfortunately, most investors pay little attention to this vital subject and end up losing their shirts because they don't understand the elements of risk.<br />Armstrong then covers modern portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, and the overwhelming importance of proper asset allocation (e.g., stocks, bonds, and cash) compared to individual stock selection or market timing.  Other topics covered include: whether managers add value (not really), benchmarks, controlling costs and taxes, and some investing horror stories.<br />Armstrong provides interesting statistics on building a portfolio first with an allocation of 60% in the S&amp;P 500 and 40% in long-term bonds from 1975- 2000.  This portfolio provided and annual return of 14.43% with a standard deviation of 11.42%.  He then provides different portfolio mixes and ends with a portfolio of investment vehicles that provide an annual return of 14.71% with a standard deviation of 9.09% -- a significant improvement in lowering its riskiness.  Armstrong provides guidelines in investing for retirement using a global equity exposure and bonds.<br />Once the allocation is determined the next step is to actually select the investment vehicles.  Here, Armstrong focuses on selecting mutual funds, closed end funds unit investment trusts, REITs, variable annuities, ETFs, and index funds.  He points out the differences of using investment advisors or doing it yourself.<br />There is an appendix with a sample investment policy statement for individuals that can serve as a model for most individuals with appropriate adjustments, as necessary.<br />In conclusion, Armstrong provides a practical, easy-to-implement asset allocation approach using no-load mutual funds and other vehicles.  For individuals that need an advisor, he provides helpful hints in selecting one.  The new and average investor will greatly benefit from the wisdom provided in this book.ferent portfolio mixes and ends with a portfolio of investment vehicles that provide an annual return of 14.71% with a standard deviation of 9.09% -- a significant improvement in lowering its riskiness.

After reading this book, they will change their tune.  Cycles should play a major role in your stock market arsenal and this book clearly lays out the case in excrutiating detail.<br /><br />This book is Volume I of a 5-part series on &quot; The Ultimate Book on Stock Market Timing&quot; by Raymond Merriman:<br /><br />Volume I. Cycles and Patterns in Indexes<br />Volume II. Geocosmic Correlations to Investment Cycles<br />Volume III. Geocosmic Correlations to Trading Cycles<br />Volume IV. Geocosmic Correlations to Short-Term Trading (not yet completed)<br />Volume V. Technical Tools and Trading Cycles (not yet completed)<br /><br />This 227-page 16 chapter book provides solid evidence that cycles exist in stock prices.  The book documents the cycles and patterns with 5 graphs and charts, 18 figures and diagrams, and 25 tables.<br />Merriman begins by explaining cycle characteristics -- definition of a cycle, troughs and crests, time band, and distortions.  Then he covers the three basic categories of cycles (primary, long-term, and short-term) followed by their subcycles known as phases.  Next, Merriman covers trends and teh criteria for identifying bull and bear markets.<br /><br />Long-term cycles (80-year, 54-year Kondratieff) and their subcycles are then reviewed with examples.  One chapter is devoted solely to the 18-year cycle in stock prices because that time interval occurs frequently.  Multiples of the this cycle -- 36-year, 54-year, 72-year and 90-year -- are covered as they also appear over time in the past 200 years or so.  Merriman provides a table of 18-year cycles from 1797 to 1990 showing the cycle highs and lows, accompanied by 12 charts illustrating the cycle high and low points.<br /><br />Merriman then delves into the subcycles of the 18-year cycle with a detailed discussion of the eleven cycle periods from 1797 to 1990.  He then moves into the well-known 4-year cycle pinpointing all of these cycles since 1896 with the month and year of the cycle troughs.  This is further supported with a table indicating every 4-year cycle trough, crest, and trough; months up and down; low, high, and low of cycle; % up and % down.  All the cycles in the table were grouped in terms of the larger 18-year cycle. The structure of the cycle is reviewed using 27 graphs of each 4-year cycle pinpointing the high and low poits.  Additional information is provided on the two- and three- phase 4-year cycles and subcycles, and a table showing the 4-year cycle from 1895 and the proximity to the U.S. Presidential Election.  Details on the 22.5 months cycle are also included.<br /><br />There is a 33-page chapter on all the cycles evident in the Japan Nikkei Stock Index.  Technical analysis is the title of a chapter that deals with investing vs. trading, and market timing vs. buy-and-hold.  Included is a table showing the 4-year cycle crests in  U.S. stock prices and the length ot time needed to get back to the crest.<br /><br />In summary, Merriman provides a truly enlightening and useful guide to identifying and using cycles to time the market with increased precision.  Students of the market will find that this book offers another important tool to conquering the market.  Cycle review should be part of every trader's and investor's methodology, otherwise optimal results may not be obtained.se cycles since 1896 with the month and year of the cycle troughs.

I've seen Headley speak at a few Investor Expos and he not only knows his stuff, but he presents it clearly without going over the heads of the audience. He has taken the same approach with his book. I found the indicators that he reviews to be very useful in providing insight into them market direction. I have personally used a number of them myself over the years.<br />Not only does Headley provide the indicators, but he also includes the EasyLanguage Code for Tradestation platform users so that they can easily input his indicators on their PCs.  Headley could have kept the settings of his indicators proprietary, but he chooses the high rode and shared them with his readers.<br />Now to the review of this book. Chapter 1 focuses on Headley's favorite contrary sentiment indicator -- CBOE Equity Put/Call Ratio. Readings below 0.4 are considered bullish and above 0.8 bearish. He also draws standard Bollinger Bands (BB) on the ratio to add another dimension to determining extreme ratio readings. He also covers the weekly ratio, as well as intra-day readings. Moreover, he explains the Total Put/Call ratio (Equity and Index Options) and how to use it to determine fear or greed in the market. Throughout the chapter Headley shows the performance statistics of each indicator over specific timeframes with complete profit and loss statistics. He uses this approach throughout the book so you can see for yourself, which of the strategies have the most bang for the buck.<br />Chapter 2 covers the fund flows in and out of three Rydex Funds -- Nova, OTC and Ursa. Nova provides 1.5 times the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. OTC mirrors the performance of the NASDAQ 100, and URSA is inverse the S&amp;P 500<br />(short fund). Headley obtains the daily funds flow data for each fund directly from Rydex and then plugs the data into a formula : (Nova+OTC)/URSA. He found that the lower this ratio the lower was investor confidence in the market. This is a contrary indicator and a buy signal.  The reverse is a sell signal.<br />Chapter 3 introduces the CBOE Volatility Index known as VIX.  It is a measure  of the expected volatility of stocks based on pricing of the S&amp;P 100 (or OEX) options. VIX is also used as a contrary indicator with high readings bullish (40) and low readings (18) bearish.<br />Chapter 4 focuses on volume indicators.  He uses the daily QQQ, NASDAQ Composite and Spyders with their respective volumes.  He graphs the prices of these items with BBs on the data to identify overbought and oversold conditions.<br />Chapter 5 covers surveys used to gauge fear and greed in the markets.  Headley recommends taking a contrary position to the survey results when they reach extreme readings.  Surveys he reviews include the Investors Intelligence Bull and Bear Index, Consensus, Inc., AAII weekly poll, and Market Vane.  Performance data using these surveys is also provided.<br />Chapter 6 reviews Headley's favorite classic trend indicators.  These include weekly and daily moving averages, MACD, support and resistance, average true range, and ADX.  He briefly mentions candlestick charts using one example, and covers a few points on system testing.<br />Chapter 7 introduces  the \\"acceleration band\\" indicator developed by Headley.  He provides an explanation of the logic behind it, the EasyLanguage Code and numerous chart examples.  Headley is basically taking the directional movement each day (high-low) and dividing it by the average stock price (high+low divided by 2) to obtain the directional movement of the stock or index.  Also included is a discussion of moving average envelopes (similar to BBs) and illustrations of their use.<br />Chapter 8 covers the concept of momentum divergences.  Headley uses the MACD indicator to determine his key entry and exit points, then he introduces his unique Momentum Divergence Indicator with chart examples and TradeStation code.  He then combines the  momentum divergence with moving average envelopes to provide his buy and sell signals. He provides charts of 10 popular stocks and their performance using these indicators.<br />Chapter 9 focuses on the relative strength of stocks to its comparative market index.  This has nothing to do with the RSI indicator although they have similar names.  Headley recommends using an RS line with  5, 10, 20 and 50-day moving averages.  He provides 6 chart examples with this data and a detailed explanation.<br />Chapter 10 and 11 cover the basic principles of trading options.  Headley provides four simple option-trading rules.  He then explains option strategies in different market conditions.<br />The book's last chapter (40 pages) reviews the key tenets of trading psychology and money management.  Topics include: building a customized trading plan, psychological issues to be aware of, and effective money management rules.  Headley provides not only 10 key questions to consider about your trading plan, but also reviews the answers to each question.  To help the reader, Headley provides his only personal trading rules and suggestion and his daily trading process.<br />The bibliography contains about reference books on all aspects of investing and trading.  There is a 9-page glossary of terms, and a list of 15 websites.<br />In conclusion, Headley does a masterful job of providing traders with time-tested indicators, including two self-developed ones that he shares with readers.

For the investor or trader who is new to TA this book will have to be read a few times so that the critical concepts sink in. It is not the most complete book on the subject, nor the simpliest one to understand, but right in the middle.  For those readers with a basic knowledge of the subject who are looking for a review of the key concepts and tools, this book provides an excellent refresher with many detailed charting examples to make the teaching points.<br />Early on, Stevens very briefly covers the basic types and scaling of charts -- bar, line, candlestick, and point-and-figure.  For those readers looking for a detailed discussion of charting, I recommend the following books: Steve Nison's Beyond Candlesticks, and Greg Morris's Candlestick Charting Explained, Tom Dorsey's Point and Figure Charting (John Wiley) and Michael Burke's The Three Point Reversal Method (Chartcraft).<br />The importance of trendlines -- their rationale and construction -- support and resistance, trading ranges, and retracements are thoroughy covered in a 50-page chapter.<br />Stevens reviews chart patterns in detail in a 70-page chapter that covers ten reversal patterns (double and triple tops and bottoms; \\"V\\" tops and bottoms; round tops and bottoms; head-and-shoulders; rectangles; triangles; wedges; flags and different types of price gaps).  Each of these topics is explained using chart examples.  All the charts in the book are from the TradeStation platform and they are annotated with key points so that the reader can easily get the point.<br />Another 70-page chapater entitled \\"Technical Indicators\\" focuses on the most commonly used indicators and how to use them in determing the market's direction.  The indicators covered include: overbought and oversold; 25 pages on moving averages (simple, weighted, and smoothed) with 9, 14 and 20 days; 21 and 50 day and 200 day; 10 weeks, 20 weeks, and 50 weeks; support and resistance with moving averages; moving average cross-overs and envelopes and Bollinger Bands.<br />Then he covers oscillators.  Topics include rate of change, price oscillator, MACD, RSI and stochastics.  Stevens then reviews specialty indicators including advance/decline line, McClellan Oscillator, TRIN, sentiment (call/put ratio, CBOE Volatility Index(VIX), CBOE Nasdaq Index (VXN), new highs/new lows, bellwether stocks and sectors.<br />Next the author reviews confirmations and divergences between prices and indicators to aid in determining the stock's or market's direction.  Many charts are shown with oscillator and price examples so that the reader clearly understands the importance and meaning of divergences and confirmations.<br />Stevens then covers, in an introductory way, topics not normally included in an introductory book.  These include seasonality of stock prices, concepts of W.D. Gann (cycles, Gann charts, angles, and price squares),  Elliot Wave Analysis (wave structure and characteristics) and technical trading systems (setting up indicator trading systems and testing them).<br />In the last chapter, Stevens pulls everything together by providing a ten-item TA checklist fo what to look for by using 20 chart examples to drive home key points.  At the back of the book, Stevens provides a recommended reading list for further study, seven websites, trading book sources, charting software and data vendors, and a 15-page glossary with 110 key terms clearly explained.<br />There are 363 books on TA listed on AMAZON.

US	52626413	R1PC50HJJ023NO	0930706285	358220351	The Ultimate Book on Stock Market Timing, Volume 3: Geocosmic Correlations to Trading Cycles	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Stock Market Timing Combining Astrology and Trading Cycles	This book is Merriman's third in a series of encyclopedic tomes on the Ultimate Book on Stock Market Timing series:<br />Volume I. Cycles and Patterns in Indexes<br />Volume II. Geocosmic Correlations to Investment Cycles<br />Volume III. Geocosmic Correlations to Trading Cycles<br />Volume IV. Geocosmic Correlations to Short-Term Trading (not yet completed)<br />Volume V. Technical Tools and Trading Cycles (not yet completed)<br />Unfortunately for the reader (including myself) not familiar with astrology and the terminology, the book was hard to understand in many spots. Many of the astrological terms are neither clearly defined, nor explained as to their importance.<br />I found the book tough going in a number of spots, but totally fascinating. The amount of material to digest is substantial, but the reward can be great if Merriman's findings are implemented.<br />For readers that are not familiar with astrology, you are encouraged to read Merriman's basic primer on the subject, titled: \\"Basic Principles of Geocosmic Studies for Financial Market Timing.\\" It is a small book - about 60 pages ... . That's the entry level book for astrology and finances. Moreover, \\"Merriman on Market Cycles: The Basics\\" is the entry level book for the study of cycles applied to financial markets. It too is small, about 70 pages ... .<br />To say that Merriman is a prolific writer is an understatement. His latest exhaustive book (Volume 3) is a mere 439 pages in its 8.5\\" x 11\\" paperback format. In this work, Merriman has analyzed 3,000 geocosmic signatures that he correlated with varying cycles in the DJIA and S&P 500 futures prices.<br />Merriman begins with a discussion of \\"critical reversal\\" dates. He focuses on pinpointing astrology signs that have a high correlation with major stock market turning points, especially primary cycles (occurs approximately every 19.5 weeks (mean)).<br />The book's hypothesis is that astrologically determined reversal dates (a reversal of at least 4% in price) will accurately time a \\"major half-primary and/or primary\\" cycle low or peak within three trading days a large percentage of the time. According to Merriman, trading cycles are those encompassing the primary cycles and sub-cycles. His focus is to help position traders (not day traders) who are in the market a few days or longer improve their overall performance by using his methodology.<br />There is a short chapter covering the primary cycle and its phases. Another chapter covers geocosmic studies. A key point is that planetary cycles correspond with stock market cycles. Merriman spent a great deal of time and effort in analyzing the massive database and then presenting the data and conclusions to the reader.<br />As far as I can understand, the findings of using geocosmic signatures as a timing tool indicate that the probability of a major price reversal in stock prices ranges between 74% to 91% when a timing signal is given. There is a minimum probability of 74% that a stock market reversal will occur within 3 days of a geocosmic signature and almost a 60% probability that this signature will be within two trading days.<br />Merriman provides an interesting 7-page table showing ALL the significant turning points in U.S. stock prices between 8/1/82 through 5/1/01. It showed that 74 turning points are within their cycle times, geocosmic signatures (probability), and critical reversal dates. This data validates Merriman's hypothesis that there is strong correlation between these variables. After all, Merriman objective is to identify the high probability cycle times for position traders.<br />In summary, this book is a significant contribution in the area of timing the market using astrological signs and cycles in combination. For those readers with a solid understanding of these subject areas, the usefulness of this book is self-evident. For other readers who feel that the material presented is useful, but cannot fully understand it to use it, then consider Merriman's other services that include newsletters, seminars, software, annual forecasts and reports. ...

Edelman's 400-page tome is divided into three parts:<br />I. Part I covers the pursuit of happiness and how to achieve your goals (122 pages)<br />II. Part II focuses on selecting the most appropriate investment vehicles (102 pages)<br />III. Part III reviews how to select the best mutual funds for your needs (123 pages)<br />Overall, the book is an enjoyable read and fully researched, although Part I could have been a book by itself. The layout is pleasing to the eye - numerous charts, cartoons, tables, lists, highlighted text, examples and anecdotes.  Edelman supports his material with 219 footnotes (most are personal comments that should in the text rather than placed as footnotes on the bottom of the page) and 51 sourcing footnotes in the appendix.<br />In Part I,  Edelman helps you create a list of goals by providing worksheets.  Also provided is a list of questions, and activities to choose from that the reader is asked to fill in and select from, respectively, ranging from actions you'd like to do in your life to accomplishments to places and things you'd like to experience.<br />Edleman then covers how to achieve your goals by asking key questions.  He provides insight on how to build a plan to achieve your goals and how much money is needed.  He also covers the importance of not forgetting that long-term care insurance is critical.<br />In Part II, Edelman covers investments.  He is a big fan of using the stock market to increase wealth because of the long-term positive returns, even considering the intervening bear markets.  He believes that individuals that invest in cash equivalents (e.g., CDs, T-bills, and money market accounts) are harming themselves because of the ravages of inflation and the low total return compared to stocks.<br />Edleman provides an interesting table showing an investor's return from 1926 - 2000 based on the percentage of assets that are placed in stocks.  For example, investing 0% of one's assets in the market resulted in an annual return of 5.4% (in bonds, for example).  At 100% invested in stocks the annual return was 13.1%, and at 50% invested  the annual return was 9.4%.  Obviously, the higher percentage invested, the higher the annual return.  Edelman further points out that  over the last 100 years the market has gone up 70% of the time.<br />Edelman doesn't show 5-year periods or ten-year periods, so you cannot see the variance in different timeframes and the impact of bear markets.  Over 74 years the market has gone up, but there have been 14 bear markets and some very severe ones including the most recent from the first quarter of 2000 to the current time.  So, Edelman's table is not a true representation of the average investor's return.  Interestingly, Edelman dismisses the current bear market as a normal bear market occurrence.  This is hardly the case for many investors whose high-tech portfolios have been decimated between 50% - 90%. He does mention, later in the book, that a diversified portfolio would have softened the blow of the 2000 - 2001 bear market for many investors.<br />Edelman includes a chapter on why an investor should not invest in sector funds - you have to pick the right sector at the right time.  He provides the performance of 13 sectors from 1984 to 2000 showing the variation in performance and the difficulty in picking the right sector.<br />There is another short chapter on the four ways you can buy your investments.  He covers mutual funds, annuities, hiring an investment manager, and doing it yourself.<br />In Part III, Edelman spends 31 pages explaining Morningstar's star rating system, category rating, and style boxes.  He believes that most investors pick their funds with the highest star ratings, but are disappointed when future performance is less than expected.<br />Edelman demonstrates that high star ratings do perform well in the future and shouldn't be used for predicting future returns.  His long-winded explanation of Morningstar is a bit of overkill.  Also, in early May the firm announced a change to their rating system to be implemented in the near future.  So the value of this chapter may be minimal.<br />Edelman then spends 26 pages on how an investor should select mutual funds by understanding the principal of the standard deviation of different funds.  He also provides a chart showing how long it takes to recover from different percentage losses (e.g., a fund losing 80% of its value will take 14 years to break-even assuming a 12% annual return).  Edelman favors actively managed funds to index funds because, he says, that the latter haven't outperformed them.<br />Additional chapters in Part III cover how many funds do you need to be diversified, and active vs. passive management.<br />Edelman has strong opinions on how to invest.  While I always don't agree with them, at least he presents his case with facts, statistics, and examples.  Overall this book should provide the reader with useful insights into planning life's goals, enjoying them, and which investments to avoid in order to have the financial assets needed to live a good life.e returns.

US	52626413	RW1GV7LFW59CJ	0471208035	260945043	Riding the Bull, Beating the Bear: Market Timing for the Long-Term Investor	Books	3	11	15	N	N	Basic Book on Market Timing Using Moving Average Approach	Market timing is a subject of great controversy among investment professionals.  Over 98% of these individuals profess that market timing is useless and that no one can do it profitably on a consistent basis.  They continue to push the buy-and-hold mantra that has failed miserably since March 2000.<br />This book by Edward Yanis takes on the subject by offering up a mechanical approach (dubbed the Y-Process) to timing using a 16-week exponential moving average of the S&P 500 Index to make weekly buy and sell decisions.  Moving averages have been used for many years and there are many newsletters and market timing services that use this approach as part of or as the main element of their timing service. Yanis has back-tested his results for 71 years and concludes that the 16-week exponential average has the best results compared to other time periods.  For the year ending 2000, according to Yanis, his approach has yielded an annualized return of 20.7% compared to 11.8% for the buy-and-hold approach.

He is highly knowledgeable and he gave one of the best CEO interviews in my book Day Trading on the Edge.  David provides nitty-gritty, specific no-nonsense hard advice on trading.  There is no filler or fluff in this book, just hard earned trading lessons learned from years of trading. Trading is much easier to talk about than do successfully, and knowing the key tenets of trading can greatly decrease your learning curve.

The rules cover:<br />Preparing to Trade; Rules for Trading; Stock Selection; Entering/Exiting Trades; Active Trader;Technical Trader; Evaluating Performance; Technology and the Internet; and Mind and Money Management<br />Readers of this book should compare how they handle their trading with the rules in this book to determine where they can improve.  One excellent feature is the inclusion of a six page trading plan that covers all the bases.<br />This is one book that you cannot breeze through in one hour. It is not a difficult read, but it so full of information that more time is necessary to glean all the useful advice. The average reader will want to read this book at least three times to garner all the useful information provided.
