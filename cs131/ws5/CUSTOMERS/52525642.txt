A Death in The Hamptons is a ribald yet poignant drama starring a cast of characters seemingly cut from the recent pages of today's tabloids and set in one of the most glamorous resort destinations in America. <br />From a big name movie star (guess who????) who figures into the murder of another actor, to the sniping self-centered gossip columnist (hmmm, I wonder.....), the book is filled with a cornicopia of personalities which are so close to the truth it is chilling.<br />I promise you it will not disappoint even the toughest skinned readers. <br />The book moves at a fast pace through to a taught climax and death struggle on the high seas where good and evil play each other out amid the swells and sharks.<br />A Death in the Hamptons is brash, bold and unforgiving in style, while retaining a genuineness and sensitivity that is truly unique. Matt Bloom is a major talent whose star is on the rise.	2002-07-19

Great job.<br />Oh yeah, I read those two critical reviews and believe me they are wrong! They must be planted by another author or are written by people who have not followed James and Hugo's prescription for physical perfection. Why slam something that is obviously appreciated by so many? I guess there's always a critic in the crowd.<br />Bottom line: buy this book...period! <br />Good luck and best wishes!<br />Jenni	2002-03-06

I read this book and it is insightful, truly helpful, and packed with good, solid information.

The book first was published in the 60's and has been out of print until now. I saw the negative review below and was appalled that the reader just didn't get it. Perhaps the reader below didn't appreciate the unique style of Greenbanks approach. Greenbank refers to this as &quot;telegraph&quot; style. Or maybe the reader was secretly the author of a competitive book. Whatever it may be, ignore it. <br />Tony Greenbank is real. His ideas are sound and many people have been utilizing his ideas for more than 30 years. It is a book worth having, reading, and remembering.	2001-07-12

The author did a good job presenting the information in an easy-to-understand way and I thought the section on the history of alcohol in the United States was very interesting and gave perspective on our notions that liquor is a &quot;demon&quot;.
