However, many don't and instead rely more and more on violence and shocking plot twists instead of good writing.  I've noticed female detective stories especially become very formulaic and violent, and less interesting.  This is no exception:  very violent, gratuitous manipulation of the reader rather than just hard work on the writing, the characters simply following formulas laid out in previous books.  I had enjoyed the series up to this book, but am disappointed in it now.	2000-10-01

If you are curious about this tiny nation and want to travel there someday as I do, you'll enjoy the book.  However, the author herself  doesn't come out very well.  She seems shallow and self-centered; one of  those people who feel their own desires and thoughts are more important  than anyone else's desires or thoughts in any situation.  She seems to  think that she can atone for gross insensitivity on the one hand and  extremely unethical behavior on the other hand, by some token  breast-beating.  It reminds me of the book &quot;Three Came Back,&quot;  which was fascinating although I was certain that if I actually met the  author, I wouldn't like her.  By the way, Jamie Zeppa's book about Bhutan  is a good one to read after reading &quot;The Jesuit and the Dragon : The  Life of Father William Mackey in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan&quot;  since she taught at the college he organized.  Gives a sense of continuous  modern history.	2000-06-10

I enjoyed the book because I grew up in the same era, but on  the opposite coast, with very different experiences,although both the  author and I grew up very poor. Still, white poor isn't exactly the same as  black poor, and so it was a peek into a different existence, of a brighter  more energetic person than I.  Some of the recipes are rather vague, and it  is assumed the reader already knows how to cook.  Some are very clear and  easy to follow.  Reading this book almost 30 years after it was written,  the slang of the 1960s  seems dated and a little tedious.	1999-04-26

He is certainly braver than I am, travelling alone  in dangerous areas, which gives more depth to his tales, but you have to  wonder if all that difficulty was necessary?

It looks self-published, which is no dishonor.  It is a collection of memories, many very violent.

In this cookbook, Jeanne Jones updates the uninspired cooking of the 1960s and 1970s, using low-fat cheese, low-salt and low-fat canned and frozen ingredients, frequently low-fat cream of chicken or cream of celery soup.  Among the amazing recipes is one for a baked cottage cheese loaf that includes 5 cups of cheerios in the ingredients, plus several variations of the ubiquitous rice-soup-cheese-meat casserole I remember from childhood.  Her suggestion for a wedding meal is a lima bean lasagna! In fairness, many of these recipes aren't her idea.  She revises recipes sent to her by readers, so evidently this is still what we are really eating in America. Still, the major change in cooking in the last 20 years has been the use of fresh ingredients, and the movement away from canned, preserved ingredients.  While she makes a nod now and then to more modern cooking (chicken on herbed quinoa with pink peppercorn sauce), this is mostly a low-fat rehashing of the familiar past.	1998-02-04

This is the story of a tragedy, but is not depressing.  I've been recommending this book to friends because it is very uplifting and encouraging, besides being very readable.  The Tibetans really had something in their culture that was of value, a pervading spirituality that was cheerful and peaceful.  And yet, they didn't feel any need to convert others or force their religion on anyone.  The authors of &quot;Tibet is My Country&quot; don't address the corruption in the Tibetan government or other problems, but those issues are  realistically addressed by the Dalai Lama himself in &quot;Freedom in Exile.&quot;  This is a light charming nostalgic look at a lost way of life.	1998-02-01

However much of the book is self-revelation, as she explores her own messy, misdirected spiritual path, sincere and devout, but frequently meeting failure, as in her attempt to become a nun.  She seems very well suited to hospice work, and seems pretty honest about her own character flaws.  Amazingly, I found myself feeling quite cheerful while reading her book.  How nice to read about the spiritual strugglings of another, and how encouraging to see that she has attained a depth of spirituality many people never reach, in spite of all her flaws.  There's hope for the rest of us who sincerely want to live a spiritual life, but could never emulate the self-sacrifice of a Mother Teresa.	1998-01-08

This is pretty light-weight stuff, considering the amount of time Dunne spent in the courtroom during the trial of the century.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly; since Dominick Dunne is the twentieth century's most famous writer of the roman a clef, and the name-dropper supreme it is full of titillating info (much of it quite dated) about the rich and famous.  It's really a memoir in the form of a novel (not the reverse, as the title suggests.)  There is actually not very much about the trial, and a great deal about all of the wealthy, famous, titled people he knows who were salivating for behind the scenes tidbits. I was hoping for something a little more penetrating than this, which is a diary of social engagements more than anything else.  High-class tabloid writing (social class, not quality of writing)with a good dose of gossip columnist as well.  Not his best book, but engrossing just the same.  And, of course, very convenient that it is supposed to be fiction, so he doesn't have to be responsible for the accuracy of all the dirt he dishes.	1997-12-24
