This is one of the books that will remain closest to me...the kind of book I would definitely have on my own children's bookshelf. I unfortunately had to stop reading the book midway because the library wanted it back, and I was also going to be out of town. Three months later, I still felt compelled to go back to the library and finish off the remaining two or three chapters.    The book is a detailed account of Marie Curie's personal and professional life. And who better to tell this story than Eve, her own daughter. The genius in Mme. Curie was a direct result of her dedication to hard work and an amazing work ethic. From a peasant Polish family, she faced many challenges and postponed her own education and worked for a wealthy family to help pay for her older sister's education. Such was Marie's spirit and selflessness - which extended to her research and her work in science.     Her creation, radium, was the ultimate criminal that led to her untimely death, when she felt she still had a lot to accomplish. The lady was indeed a noble gift to the science world.	2005-08-19

The book has a remarkable opening, and the writing is wistful and somewhat entertaining. Danielle Ofri writes about the stress and challenges of working in a major city hospital like Bellevue, New York. It's clear that there is a dynamic, a connectedness between Dr. Ofri and her patients.    There are many challenges and decisions faced in medicine. How, for example, would one deal with a patient with chronic renal problems who wants to be taken off dialysis to die a slow death? And how does one tell an incarcerated patient with advanced diabetes that they are only going to get worse?    The book \\"Incidental Findings\\" contains details about her work and travels to Florida, New England, and Mexico. Ofri also raises many questions on ethics in the book. In one of the chapters, she seeks to find common ground with a patient seeking an abortion. Ofri herself had an abortion at 17. This also brings in the hardships of trying to keep one's personal life from the profession.	2005-07-30

I bought \\"Kite Runner\\" in an airport bookstore, and started reading it right away. The novel is about childhood, feelings, obligations, and brotherhood. It's not predictable, so it doesn't get boring. The book's a bestseller, and I think it deserves it. I would not dream of giving the plot away, you just have to read it!    I highly recommend \\"Kite Runner\\" to everybody. It reads quickly and it's absorbing. The reading is quite an experience in and of itself.	2005-06-17

The story evolves around a Nigerian family - narrated through the voice of 16 year old Kambili Achike. The voice is lucid, and we get insight into corrupt governments and their politics. Kambili's father is extremely religious, and is too conscious of his patriarchal role in the household...he often abuses his wife and children in the name of God. Papa will not hesitate to flog his wife or his children when he feels that they have sinned. This family is a microcosm of Nigeria in many ways. According to Adichie, the are so many churches being formed at every corner in Lagos, and yet Nigeria remains one of the most corrupt countries. Kambili and her brother Jaja are prisoners in their own home, until they take a visit to Nsukka, where Aunty Ifeoma lives. Kambili falls in love with Father Amadi, a young Catholic priest who also helps to morph her into a free spirit.    The story is all too real. I know people in life who are carbon copies of the characters in the book. \\"Purple Hibiscus\\"  reminds one of how Africa - with its dozens of countries and hundreds of languages - faces similar ills, and shares many cultural aspects. Yes, this novel is also a celebration of Igbo culture - - its cuisine and language. Adichie uses a sizable Igbo vocabulary, but does it very effectively without saturating the novel.    The story is very life-like and there are many lessons to draw from. It highlights family life and generational conflicts in Nigeria. It is an amazing debut, I am eagerly awaiting her next work!	2005-05-18

The love between Valcourt (a Canadian \\"paratrooper\\") and Gentille (a rather unassertive Rwandan girl) was unconvincing and lacking, the characters were underdeveloped and downright boring.    This book portrays Rwanda as the master nation of black misogynist lechers and insatiable hussies ever ready to satisfy the sexual needs of the whole French-speaking expatriate white world. It's shocking that Courtemanche chose the famous Hotel Mille-Collines as the setting for this book, and yet failed to mention (or create) characters like Paul Resesabagina (the hero to which the newly released movie, \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" extols), who saved hundreds of people at this very hotel. Although Rwanda does have it's problems, this book depressingly goes overboard by painting it as some dark, uncivilized, AIDS-infested hovel in constant chaos and corruption.     Courtemanche's book gives the reader no background as to the politics and long history behind 1994. I expected better from a journalist. This book is just overly poor, I'm surprised anyone even bothered or volunteered to translate it. It's not consistent with the true history, it will give (uninformed) people a wrong impression of the genocide, how it happened, and the forces that were behind it.     This is the shallowest book I have ever read. It's not worth a single penny! This Gil Courtemanche guy should take some good advice and stick to journalism!	2005-01-11

This is a narration of the life of a young (and nave) neurosurgeon in residency. Frank Vertosick shares some profound experiences in this unsparing book, which will be particularly useful to those who want to know what residency entails - it's challenging and interesting points. <br /> <br />Among Vertosick's stories is one about a young man taken into the hospital with the then-unknown disease of AIDS. He became the first person reported to that particular health department with the strange new illness. We are also told heart-wrenching stories of human struggle, like the story of Shirley, who dies after numerous hours of fighting a damaged aorta and brain. There is also a touching story of Andy, who happens to have \\"trisomy 21\\" (Down syndrome), and is also deaf, blind, mute, and has a brain hemorrhage.  <br /> <br />The book is quite shocking in some parts, and educational too. Where you imagine a triumphant ending, the unexpected (and sad) happens. It's a book of triumphant stories, and disappointing ones. The stories all move at a decent, likable pace. The book leaves you with the feeling that physicians are in fact very human as Vertosick tells the story of  Charles, who has an uneventful aneurismal tear while in his hands. Not all is victory as a neurosurgeon. A surgeon often has to deal with death and mistakes. <br /> <br />Some parts were fictionalized to enhance the story, but still a good book nonetheless. Enlightening. <br />	2005-01-05

It took me more than three weeks to finish a book I would normally have finished in three days. I found this book extensively pointless, lifeless, and vastly uninteresting. I didn't care much about the meaningless meanderings of some schizoid pervert and his kidnapped \\"Lolita\\". The book was quite stagnant in many parts, over-pretentious in others, and too predictable in many more. I find very little interest in reading about a pedophile's beastly quests and obsessions with so-called \\"pubescent pets\\", \\"girl-children\\", and unsuspecting \\"nymphets\\". The 12 year old Lolita (Dolores Haze) herself seems completely counterfeit and weightless to me...she's a horrendously created character at best, who is strangely unaffected at the news of her mother's death. Quilty was a hollow character intended to add a little action - - but sadly Nabokov did all this quite unsuccessfully. <br /> <br />Nabokov's colorful prose only directs even more attention to a dull, forced, and frumpy storyline. Once you've read part 1, reading part 2 is really an unnecessary, if not painful endeavor. There are too many lulling passages of vapid repetitiveness and inactivity throughout the book. Even more absurd is the fact that Vanity Fair had the nerve to call it \\"the only convincing love story of our century\\". This is not a love story...this is child abuse.  <br /> <br />Every word and every turn of the page tempts you to just drop the book. I will venture to say that this is the most over-rated book in our lifetime. In my opinion, this is not a book to buy - get it from the library if you have to. The only happy moment I had with this book is when I finished it. <br />	2004-12-30

I liked the book so much that I felt a sudden sorrow as I read the last page. I just wanted to keep reading on and on. I have read a lot of articles and books on Rwanda, but this one is just exceptional. This is the closest I have come to comprehending what took place in Rwanda. The book uses several key individuals to narrate the stroy of all other  <br />Rwandans and their experiences in the genocide. Philip Gourevitch did an extraordinary job, and I think the book is very well-deserving of its five-star rating. I could hardly keep my fingers off the book for the whole period. <br /> <br />The book explains how the \\"international community\\" not only sat and watched the genocide unfold, but also demonstrates how this \\"international community\\" HELPED the Hutu extremists kill more people by feeding and funding them. There were many times when I stopped reading and simply glared into the ceiling to ask myself if what I was reading was really true. Doctors killed patients, doctors killed fellow doctors, patients killed doctors, neighbours killed fellow neighbours, and family members and friends killed each other. Some priests, nuns, and prominent politicians also carried their machetes and rifles and helped out too. Children as young as seven were also participants in the horror. Whole villages were wiped out in a matter of days, and whole families were decimated. What is most striking is that the genocide started long before 1994. Numerous Tutsis were being massacred in the 50's and 60's (and further on)...and nobody did anything. April 1994 was largely a culmination of the impunity that had been tolerated for decades. One does wonder how all the survivors today live knowing that the very killers who killed their families are living among them, unpunished.  <br /> <br />Gourevitch also goes into the camps in North and South Kivu (near the border with the DRC), and explains the workings of Hutu malitia there. He intelligently delves into the post -'94 politics of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC - as well as the workings of Mobutu and other politicians. I had a much deeper understanding of politics in Central Africa when I finished the book. The book also ends with an interview with Rwanda's current president (Kagame), and his own insight into what happened, and also what's in store for Rwanda's future. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book any day. In fact, I advise anyone who gets the chance to go ahead and read it. It gave me a better appreciation of life, the sad reality of world politics, and a profound sense of regret for what happened in Rwanda. I don't take it lightly either, that I finished this book on my birthday. <br />	2004-12-06

The first one gives a lengthy history of Rosalind, her family, and other generalities (including her love for everything French and a penchant for hiking). The second delves into Franklin's connection to DNA, and the third part focuses on her work after she left the Kings lab to pursue other projects (in viruses especially).  <br /> <br />Like many other people, I first learnt about Rosalind in Watson's book, \\"The Double Helix\\", in which she was horribly caricatured. I chose to read the book because I wanted to know more about this \\"dark lady\\" -  and I am happy to say that my thirst was quenched. The author uses a wealth of first-hand material, including Rosalind's many letters to various people. Although Franklin is said to have had a sharp and impatient tongue, the book demonstrates that she was also a good friend and a diligent scientist. She was a hard worker in spite of all the hardships of being a woman (and Jewish) in an arena that was mostly male. <br /> <br />I really think that the book does justice to Rosalind in highlighting how her work was undervalued and unappreciated. The book summarizes it all when it states that \\"she had provided all the essential data for those who took the two brilliant leaps of intuition\\". I would definitely recommend this book if you want to know more about Rosalind Franklin and her connection to DNA. <br />	2004-11-29

I don't think that this short novel is deserving of all the lauding reviews that it has been given by other reviewers. Although the book is indeed boundless in potential...there were some fundamental flaws that I found hard to ignore.     I found Mouche too whiny and passive a character. I understand that this is just a fiction...but really - her docility was just petrifying! I found it too unreal that someone would be raped, abused, chided, and kept as a profitable concubine by a schizoid ventriloquist by night, and then laugh and play with this same demon in the disguise of seven little dolls by day. Honestly, could a normal person miss this link? I actually ended up concluding that Mouche is insane herself, and that the book amply demonstrates how birds of the same breed will flock together. Paul Gallico tries his best to portray Mouche as having some kind of an angelic, untanishable innocence - - but the truth is that she is dangerously passive, and has a major paralysis in character.    My review would be incomplete if I didn't mention Golo, the Senegalese slave/messenger who is also helplessly passive. He is kicked around by the degenerate clown and he actually seems to be convinced that this is his rightful place in society. Some of the stereotypes made by the writer himself about Senegalese/African culture can only be called absurd, but then these are only prejudices of his day. This novel was written in the 1950s.    The ending was disappointing. I still felt as though Mouche had fallen in love with the seven dolls, and not with Peyrot. This book might be good in demonstrating existentialism, but I couldn't bare the incensing passivity of its characters.	2004-11-12

I also chose to base a school project on it. I am quite convinced that \\"Biology as Ideology\\" might actually have been one of the most important books of the previous century (Yes, I mentioned this in my project). And although it is atypical of me to comment on other people's reviews, some things just warrant correction. Contrary to what one reviewer said, Lewontin never once suggests that \\"there is no such thing as race\\" in this book. And although Lewontin has a thing or to two to say about reductionism - - he does not completely resent it. He talks about an ideal view \\"that sees the entire world neither as an indissoluble whole, or as isolated bits and pieces\\". It's easy to miss this message because Lewontin does tend to have a propensity for veering off-topic once in a while. I also don't think that it's far-fetched at all to call Lewontin a Marxist. Although he only mentions Karl Marx once in this book, most of his views on society strongly cohere with Marx's.  <br /> <br />In our world today, any product of science is claimed and treated as a universal truth. Lewontin encourages the reader not to be mystified by science (don't just leave it to the experts!) And science has never been as \\"objective\\" and \\"nonpolitical\\" as it claims because it's a product of society. Scientists will view nature through lens molded by social experience. <br /> <br />I thought it daring (and brave) that Lewontin - a luminary in the study of genetics today -  should question Darwin's \\"natural selection\\", and see more sense in Lamarck's inheritance of acquired characteristics. This book is good because it makes you observe the other side of things. It makes you think. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most excellent point made by Lewontin in his book is that of biological determinism as a way of social legitimization. Biological determinism has been used to explain and justify the inequalitieswithin and between societies and to claim that those inequalities can never be changed. We are being taught that there is genetic differentiation between racial groups in characteristics such as behavior, temperament, and intelligence. We are also being taught that people's genes are connected to things like unemployment, eroticism, dominance, poverty, and homelessness. It really getting ridiculous! There is too much power being blunderingly put on the DNA molecule. <br /> <br />I however, disagree with Lewontin that the genome project was a waste of time and billions. It has helped not only consolidate the theory of evolution...but it has also helped in areas like systematics, phylogeny, and taxonomy. Another shortcoming is that Lewontin's book is more than a decade old - many discoveries and advancements have occurred since then in molecular genetics. <br />	2004-11-01

I started reading this book because I thought it would be one of her fictions, but it's not. I kept on reading it and I was happy to discover that Tan and I come from the same elements of familial woes. It was strangely pleasant because I felt like part of my own life was unfolding in this book. She gives vivid descriptions of her life: why she writes, her early fascination with Nabokov, her own views on being classified as an \\"Asian American\\" writer, her torrid relationship with her mother, the deaths of her brother, father, and friend, etc. Amy Tan was recently diagnosed with Lyme's disease, a neurological ailment caused by nymph ticks. She talks about finding hope in the deeper self, even though her whole immediate family has been haunted and devoured by neurological illnesses (brain tumors, Alzheimer's). All in all, I think this book offers an introduction to Amy Tan as a writer, as an individual.  And I find the \\"mystical\\" and coincidental ways in which some of her works come to being particularly intriguing, or perhaps contrived (?). It will not take you long though, to discover that she uses melodrama in a morbid, but titillating way. <br /> <br />The book touches all sorts of subjects. From fear and faith, to fate and mortality. It candidly corrects the misconceptions and assumptions that have been seculated by the media and become part of Tan's \\"unofficial biography\\", as she terms it.  <br /> <br />Of all readers, I think that this book will be appreciated by her truest and most loyal fans. In this book of \\"musings\\", Tan is explaining and uncovering her personality as a writer...as if to let her own beloved readers know who she really is.  <br /> <br />The only reason that I give this book four stars is because three or four of the sections in this book made me want to sleep. They were somewhat slow and boring, which is really not rare in such books that try to touch on every single topic. I also felt like Tan could have made her sentences a little more colorful, and embellished some of her paragraphs in some of the sections. It was a good job otherwise. <br />	2004-10-20

As an immigrant, a person of color, and an economically unprivileged individual, I could relate to every single sentence in the book. Everyone interested in getting into medical school should read \\"What I Learned In Medical School\\", particularly those who might have faced roadblocks. The stories are inspirational and come from varied training physicians. All of them clearly show that hard work and perseverance will always triumph over poverty, stress, abuse, or any other obstacle known to man. <br /> <br />I have been in American hospitals before and have not been pleased with the under representation of some groups in the medical field. Hopefully, books like this one should inspire people to achieve the higher things; be it in medicine or anything else out there. I would put this book in every high school library. And if you are a parent, buy this book for your child now! Hopefully the face of medicine and academia will change. I am all for this book! <br /> <br />Some of the essays were touching, some were funny (like Holman's \\"Sometimes, All You Can Do Is Laugh\\"), and some even seemed a little silly to me (\\"A Prayer from a Closeted Christian\\"). But ALL the stories were touching. \\"A Case Presentation\\" was interestingly written. This book has something for everyone.  <br /> <br />When you finish the book, you get a sense that the face of medicine in America is changing, albeit slowly. And you learn that physicians are human beings who also come with flaws and imperfections like all of us. <br /> <br />Read it! <br /> <br />	2004-09-20

Unfortunately, I have other pressing engagements. But what a brilliant way to end my summer reading stint by reading Sacks! The title \\"the poet laureate of medicine\\" is clearly a befitting one for Oliver Sacks. He has an uncanny way of making science lively, fun, and enjoyable. \\"Vintage Sacks\\" is a hodgepodge of his various works like \\"Uncle Tungsten\\", \\"Awakenings\\", \\"Seeing Voices\\" and others. The first two chapters are autobiographical, and both are a testament to his love of Science, especially chemistry. Chapter 2 (Stinks and Bangs\\") does look like a section straight out of a Chemistry textbook or a lab report. It made me think that if I had grown up anywhere near as privileged as Sacks has, I would have froliced with some explosive chemicals in a private lab too.    Reading Sacks' books has given me interest in the roles of dopamine, L-dopa, Haldol, and other compounds and chemicals that affect the brain. Reading \\"Vintage Sacks\\" was enlightening in a profound way.    The book deals with subjects like deafness, \\"oculogyric crises\\", Tourette's syndrome, and how the senses essentially work together. Dr. Bennett of \\"A Surgeon's Life\\" was fascinating. I think he aught to write his won autobiography. It would help to bring awareness to the syndrome. And Sacks' arguments for sign language in \\"A Deaf World\\" are compelling. Here, he takes on the voice of an activist. In \\"Pingelap\\", Sacks morphs into an awed explorer in the Pacific.    This book would be a great introduction to anyone who might not have read any works by Oliver Sacks before.	2004-09-17

One day, I just decided to pick it up. It's about an ingenious young girl (Anne Frank of course) who manages to keep a diary named Kitty in which she narrates her life as she hides (in the \\"Secret Annexe\\") from the persecution of Jews by the Nazis. She narrates her life, hopes, and sorrows in this solitary hiding place. She articulates herself clearly, precociously. I have actually toyed around with the idea of keeping a \\"Kitty\\" for myself, but I couldn't bare the thought of someone coming across it and reading it.<br /><br />It is in this confinement that Anne matures and grows. She goes through puberty and becomes curious, like any other teenager would be. She writes about the people in the \\"Secret Annex\\" and how they relate to each other. Anne grows into a young, observant woman. She develops feelings for Peter, and describes how it is to be in love. Really, it's just beautiful.<br /><br />Another interesting feature about the diary is that although it was written during a tumultuous time in the history of Europe, it doesn't confine itself to Gestapo raids, Nazi cruelty, and Jewish suffering. It goes beyond that. It provides a complete human experience. I guess that's what I liked most about it. It's simple, but intelligently written. I continuously asked myself if any editing has been done during its translation or its publication. I was impressed by the lucidity of a girl barely into her teen years. It's an honest, meditative, reflective book.<br /><br />The epilogue was sad and haunting, but Anne Frank still lives in many ways. If you haven't read the book yet, by all means, do so.	2004-09-17

The earlier chapters are somewhat disorganized, but understandably so perhaps: Watson is not exactly a writer. \\"The Double Helix\\" is a fascinating tale about how DNA structure was discovered and understood in detail. It is written in novel form, like a biography - which adds a little more humanity and simplicity to it all. Therefore, anyone can read it. <br /> <br />As you get to the middle, it gets quite involved as Watson narrates the ups and downs that he and Crick (and others) encountered. He also writes about the jealousies, tensions, and hardships in science research. He describes his partner, Francis, as a constant talker - almost obnoxious. I found the way Watson described Rosalind Franklin a little unsettling. It seems that he just casts her off as a choleric woman having a hard time in a men's world of science and research. It's clear that he doesn't give her the recognition she deserves. I doubt that Watson and Crick would have solved the structure of DNA without Rose's hard work in crystallography and x-rays. <br /> <br />On another note however, it's good that Watson wrote this book when events were still fresh in his mind, as he claims. As for DNA itself...people shall keep on making more and more discoveries a thousand years from now. Watson and Crick  (and others) just helped hurl things up to the horizon. Discoveries on DNA, chromosomes, genes, etc. shall continue to unprecedented heights. And who knows what else is out there that we don't know? <br /> <br />I almost gave it 4 stars, but truth be told: my mind was less than piqued by Watson's writing style. And maybe if he showed the tiniest bit of respect for Ms. Franklin, her contributions, and her hard work. <br />	2004-08-20

I absolutely loathed the first 240 pages or so, and at that brief moment, almost stopped reading it. However, I enjoyed the last 100 pages of the book.     I was frankly befuddled at my own ambivalence to the first two thirds of the novel. I wasn't quite sure what to think of \\"Three Star Fix\\", until I took some time to brood a little bit. It's not what I had expected after reading the other two glorifying reviews that it got. It did not stimulate me at all. I was very disappointed.     There were a few parts in the book that were interesting. But these were too few and too spread apart throughout the whole 342 pages. As you can imagine, this leaves boring lulls in-between that can make you want to quit reading the book. Jake Thomas's descriptions of his work as a mariner were highly irritating. I also found his obsessive tales of sex quite obnoxious. His sexual escapades with poor third-world prostitutes were rather a turn-off for me. It was rather disturbing.    I also found myself wondering why the book was so unnecessarily long, when in fact most of the occurrences were variegated repeats of past chapters. All chapters oscillated between Jake's travel, work, confused brooding, and whoring!    The tide changed a little bit after the first two thirds of the novel, when Ana Elena enters the picture. That is when the novel reaches the climax...in Valparaiso. Jake realizes that he's been used by Ana Elena - a girl who he had started loving greatly in their first two days together. He finds out that she is to be married, and that she was just using him for sex. Jake is frustrated...gets himself on drugs, and then sleeps with Rosa. This was driven by the combination of inebriation and a broken heart. Jake assumes Rosa is killed by Fletcher (her boyfriend) while they were \\"making love\\". He gets gonorrhea...and the story goes on. All this starts the self-questioning of Jake. This is when he really starts taking in lessens about life and love from a special friend.    There were some nice moments in the book too. Jack's various inner conflicts, the storm, and the ominous ring were all nice additives.    Jablonski could have made his book shorter, and better. For this reason and others, I give the book a whapping 3 stars!!!	2004-08-18

Its organization was poor and the book seems like it could have been completed hurriedly in a matter of days. It could have been written in a more appealing way - a captivating way. BUT it was an interesting read, undoubtedly. It starts off a little slow for the first quarter or so of the book. It tells the story of how freedom was instantly taken away from the women in Afghanistan as soon as the Taliban took over. Contrary to popular belief, Afghan women used to be just as free as any other women in any other part of the world. It's the Taliban (with other warring factions) that started most of the havoc. <br /> <br />As the story goes on, one can easily see the effects of a country that willfully ostracizes a whole segment of its own population. In fact, half of its population (if not more). The country becomes a nightmare in broad daylight. <br /> <br />Under perpetual siege, it's all fascinating how people get anesthetized to it all. As large museums and universities burn to ashes, weddings continue to take place and students continue to attend school. The question is: What is the future for Afghanistan - the women and the children especially. Only time will tell.  <br />	2004-08-18
US	20469836	R3LHNJZMWU6WLL	1586482122	939505410	Slave: My True Story	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Enraging!	I've always fantasized about how life was like for the Nuba before the ravaging war. The book had a brilliant start - a poignant description of what life was like for Mende in the Nuba mountains: how her people lived, her most memorable moments, her daily activities, her joys etc. We are shown the beauty of her people and we get a glimpse into her culture. <br /> <br />It all takes a sudden turn when the Arabs come, of course. I wish I was surprised by the horrid story that ensues, but I've seen similar things happen before, although not to this extent. By reading this book, I think people will realize that the world is not all honey and jam. There is a lot of injustice taking place in many parts of the world. The story was very touching - and enraging. I hope that the situation in Sudan will change for the better, and that peace prevails. With the attention now presently being given to the atrocities in the Darfur region, maybe something will happen. The strange thing is that people think that these atrocities are only found in this particular region of Sudan, which couldn't be farther from the truth. <br /> <br />People must also realize that these ages-old cultural conflicts don't just vanish spontaneously through \\"peace talks, sanctions, and food aid\\" - which has been the general formula used. It hasn't always worked. It takes time and relentless effort, especially by the Sudanese people themselves. <br /> <br />Indeed, the story of Mende Nazer is one of courage and strength - a must-read for all. A truly empowering story. <br />	2004-08-18

Ugo works as a food taster, replacing Lucca - who has just been killed. He makes friends with a lad called Tommaso (who later has an enchanting romance with Miranda). He falls in love with Agnese, who falls pregnant and dies...blah blah blah. One really has to read the book for oneself. It is awesome...something that words can't elucidate. It's one of the best fictions I have yet come across.    I recommend \\"The Foodtaster\\" to anyone looking for a good fiction. The storyline is unpredictable. Each chapter is thrilling to read and filled with suspense and adventure. Ugo is a character with foibles and flaws, which makes him very much human and easy to relate to. Indeed, this duality of fiction and realism is what livens up fiction novels.    Chapter 26 reminded me of \\"The DaVinci Code\\". I was hence forced to compare and contrast the two fictions. There is simply no comparison. \\"The Foodtaster\\" has a stronger, more solid plot. So, \\"The DaVinci Code\\" simply pales in comparison, in case you've read it before.    The novel has sprinkles of twists every now and then that make it even sweeter - not like those found in other obnoxious fictions though. This novel is simply a joy. They don't write them like this these days.	2004-08-18

Kay Redfield Jamison is an intelligent person who one might never assume to have manic-depression, the illness without a face. It can loom in on anyone who has inherited a certain genetic trait, and many never find out that they have it! I like the way the book is written - in a clear, lucid manner. Her story starts off at childhood, and follows her to adulthood. The narration takes no short-cuts. She also writes about her very intriguing experiences in the world of academia. I found the narration about her relationship with David particularly touching.    \\"An Unquiet Mind\\" will be appreciated not only by those with manic depression, but also by those who do not have it. It will educate and enlighten. The language used is clear and simple. It awoke in me an interest in the effects of lithium on the brain, especially in manic-depressive individuals.    An unsparing, heartfelt, truthful, and genuine story it is. Jamison spares very little in getting to the personal aspects of her life. It's wonderful how a person with an affliction or a disorder can rise above obstacles and limitations. This is essentially what this story is about.    I was also intrigued by the duality of psychological illness - the whims of manic-depression. Your highs are like heaven, and your lows are literal hell. The book is a throwback to the books of Oliver Sacks.	2004-08-18

Appropriately, it's written in a very straight forward way. The reader will just flow along with every word, every sentence, every paragraph, and every chapter.<br /><br />In the book, people made \\"optimistic speeches\\" and devised reasons for their being evacuated from their homes into ghettoes - a type of denial not uncommon in oppressed populations. \\"Night\\" should teach every single person that genocide can occur anywhere, and at any time, in any given unstable society. But above all, the book allows us to see the insecurity, hopelessness, uncertainty, and vulnerability of the Jewish people at such a tumultuous time in their history.<br /><br />\\"Night\\" moves fast. Its sentences are simple - without any embellishments - but the reader gets the complete message. As one reads on, the same question (which the author asks explicitly several times) resounds: Why does \\"He\\" let people suffer? Well...wouldn't we all want to know?<br /><br />As Elie and his father bravely go through the holocaust, we see not only its horrors, but a love that grows - the love between father and son, or even friends. It is a touching story that shows hope manifest itself at a time of despair. Every one must read this book. It has a voice; a voice that speaks volumes. It has a message - a message for every soul.	2004-08-12

It is a collection of intriguing and mind-provoking stories of the mind. Some of the \\"tales\\" actually made me apprehensive of my future and my occasional case of mild amnesia. You'll fine these cases interesting even if you've never read anything on neurology, or if you know little of brain anatomy and physiology. It's a great book. Actually, it's splendid!     I particularly found the story of \\"Jimmie\\" very interesting and touching at the same time (Chapter 2). Indeed, there is more to a human being than just memory. There is also \\"feeling, will, sensibility, moral being,\\" and other intangibles. ALL of the stories were really just fascinating. Dr. Sacks also writes in a beautiful, easy, and almost poetic style - which makes the book a relatively fast read.     People have likened the brain to a computer at times, but after reading the book, you begin to realize that the central nervous system is really much more complex and complicated than a mere computer. Dr. Sacks does away with all the scientific and medical jargon that often complicates comprehension. This is why this book is not only readable, but also enjoyable. Once I read the first case, I was hooked! I couldn't put the book down. All the cases are like a puzzle - a fascinating labyrinth. I was happy to discover \\"proprioception\\" and many other things that were not part of my knowledge before. Some of the cases might even tear you eyes, or enchant you. Some are downright risible!    There is not a single story in this book that didn't make me say \\"wow!\\" I applaud Dr. Sacks. It's a job well done.	2004-08-12

Sidhwa's lilting writing style makes one wonder what lies ahead in the novel. It's joyous and captivating, but also chilling at the same time. \\"Cracking India\\" is one of those books that you should just read at night time while curled up in your blankets, sipping a latte or coffee. It cozies up the mind and it is absorbing. Because of the way it flows, I thoroughly enjoyed my read.    However, a flaw that I detected was that Sidhwa's book does not have a glossary of terms with English translations of some Indian/Pakistani words and phrases in the book. And also around Chapter 12, the novel starts dragging in redundancy a little bit. It does pick up some speed on Chapter 18, as you approach the climax. Nonetheless, \\"Cracking India\\" is still an enjoyable fiction. It is wonderful to witness many occurrences of the splitting of India through Lenny's eyes and experiences. There are, of course, many other goings-on that make the novel even more interesting. I particularly found the story of Ayah (and Hamida too) a haunting example of human betrayal.     What more can be said? I enjoyed the book.	2004-08-12

The story is a fiction, but could very well be a true one. Yakov Bok is a remarkable character who hung on to dear life, even in instances where the average person would have just given up. Bibikov brought some beam of hope into Bok's life, only to be taken too soon - an example of hope being shattered in the most desperate of situations. Familiar? The story was well written and is easy to relate to. It's a fiction that is consistant with historical facts. It is highly reminiscent of Nazi Germany and the experiences of Jews in general all over the world. Most admirable, however, was the relationship between Bok and Shmuel (his father-in-law). This book is a must-read!	2004-07-16

I breezed through this one, and I have to say her autobiographies are far superior to her poems. I didn't even have the heart to understand most of them. The style is not exactly what I can call \\"delicious\\". I'm just not a fan of Maya when it comes to poetry. BUT I have to say I enjoyed the poems in \\"I Shall not be Moved\\". They just contained a different flavor in them. One can easily tell that she had grown when she wrote these ones. (I'm assuming it's her latest of all the other poetry books). Or maybe she just put more effort into it, or perhaps just decided to use a different style. I liked \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" as well.	2004-07-08

Definitely intriguing and disturbing how humanity can be so cruel and evil to fellow humans. \\"Genocide in Rwanda\\" offers multiple views on the genocide from different people, not just the authors. The book is an excellent place to start if you are have not learnt much about Rwanda. You watch the genocide through various lenses and angles. Rwanda (and every other country in the world) should realize that only it has the power to change itself for the better or worse. Ultimately, they (Hutus and Tutsis) should take responsibiltty for what they did to themselves and to their own country.     The origins of the genocide in Rwanda started on the day the Germans colonized the country. The Belgians further polarized the once unified country into Hutu, Tutsi (and Twa). From then on the whole country was on a  down-hill spiral. The culture of impunity set in, and the country was never able to recover. One thing let to the other...then BOOM, April 1994 came. UNAMIR was never meant to be their salvation. Neither was the \\"international community\\" - which heartily ignored the genocide. The Somalia situation is often used as an easy excuse as to why the world did not intervene...which is quite ridiculous. How does this same \\"international community\\" explain why the genocide in Sudan today has been ignored for decades? This should teach individual countries to resolve their own problems and to frown on external/foreign reliance.	2004-07-08

The book was just written in a horrible way. Every other sentance starts with the word \\"hell\\". It gets boring afterwards. The first half of the book moves very slowly, but the second half picks up a little more speed. This book will let people know that before Tiger Woods, there was Charlie, Lee Elder, and a lot of other guys too. It is a very good book. What Sifford went through was just horrid, but that's the reality of the world we live in. I could never blame him for being so bitter after all these years of obstacles and not being praised for what he has done. Never mind praise - just for not being allowed to play the game of golf. My limited grasp on golf parlance probably made it a little boring to read this book. But it's a good book, although it may make you a little sleepy.	2004-06-28

Even after finishing the book, I still felt like I didn't know Tambudzai as a character because it seems that she is always naive and confused, and following behind in the footsteps of someone else - in this case, Nyasha.

It's one of those books you just can't put down once you start. It goes deep inside Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) and narrates the political and cultural struggles of everyday Zimbabweans. This lady makes me proud to say my own name. She's an excellent writer and I am waiting for her to publish her next work soon. This book is almost like an emblem to all expatriates, which is no wonder that it was translated to so may languages. The main plot and story line is just universal, although the setting was African. I could certainly relate to everything. It also shows that we still do not have the political, economic, and cultural independance that we thought would come naturally after \\"independance\\".

The language is simple and honest, so you can read the book in a day or two. Her story was just remarkable and the book was well-written. People should be made aware of FGM and its effects. They should know that it exists. I particularly liked the way she ended the book. She says that if the existance of FGM has any meaningful explanation, maybe she would think twice about denouncing it...but this practice has no significant reason to exist what so ever! There were, however, too many \\"In Africa...\\" generalizations in the book. FGM is not ubiquitous in Africa, in fact, most Africans don't even know that it's there. It is just concentrated mainly in East African countries like Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Djibouti, and some areas in West Africa like Mali for example. I loved the book.

I think the book has made me a fan of her. Her style of writing was mellifluous, sincere, and truthful.<br />I am not a very emotional person, but the part that made my eyes water was when Maya went to the market in Kato, as the book ended. She met Ewe women who instantly confused her for an Ewe. They were sure Maya was an Ewe decendant because of her features and tone of voice. Once, she was mistaken for a Bambara, and an Ahanta as well. It was beautiful. I admire Maya for her having fortitude and being curious and passionate. She loves her people and was more than willing to come back home to America to help them by working for Malcolm X, promoting civil rights, et al. I have great respect for her. She also learnt how to speak the Fanti language, which I would guess was not easy.<br />It was a great autobiography.

I have taken particular interest in the situation in Sudan for months now. Whenever I think of it I get enraged, the whole animal in me comes out. I read the book and was simply incensed! Francis Bok is a man worth twelve men, if not more. He is brave, handsome, and his courage is worth emulating.     I am wondering why the world is doing nothing about this. The slavery in Sudan is a centuries-old practice of genocide. It's shameful that the Western media would rather televise naked Dinka men wrestling and drinking milk--and yet the world is oblivious to how these people have been torn..literally - by slavery, famine, and war.     The Dinka, Shilluk, Nuer, and other tribes in Southern Sudan are an African treasure and people today should be doing more. It's unfortunate that people would just rather avoid the situation and question whether or not it's genocide.   Time is running out!	2004-04-23

This book is deep and complex. One has to read it to grasp and understand. Anyway, Diop essentially divides the world into two cradles - the Northern (patriarchal in character), and Southern (Black and matriarchal). He clearly demonstrates that matriarchy could only be found in Black populations, specifically in Africa, or other places subject to Black influence. European and Asiatic societies have a patriarchal regime because of the demanding nomadic lifestyle in the Eurasian steppes. The sedentary life of Blacks is what fueled great respect for women...the Black woman being the inventor of agriculture. Children often got their names from the mother's lineage. He clearly argues his facts by explaining dowry, fire worship, cremation, amazonism, etc. He gives thorough examples throughout.<br />This is not just another feel-good book from a zealous Afrocentrist. This is true scholarship! I am sure all readers will be convinced when they finish reading it. Islam, colonization, and Christianity have truely changed the Black world in terms of its matriarchal character. We should respect our women. In European and Asian history, you will never find anything resembling the armed Sudanese Kandake, the Angolan Nzinga, the Egyptian Hatshetsup and Tiye,...the list is endless. Perhaps it's matriarchy that fueled our ancient societies to become world powers in our glory days. We can only imagine. Can Africa ever really gain what it's lost? That's the question. In a way, I feel that Diop asks the same question.	2004-04-23

In \\"Pre-Colonial Black Africa\\", (unlike all his other books) he takes a small step out of Ancient Egypt and explores more of his own home region (West Africa). His work is prolific and clearly exposes the fact that West African history can be accurately traced thousands of years, thanks to all the myriad historical texts already at our disposal (\\"Tarikh-as-Sudan\\", \\"Tarikh-as-Fettash\\", etc).     Senegal should be extremely proud of producing such a quality scholar like Diop! I would like to see his works translated to other languages (African, especially). It is important that Africans read their history from an objective (and native!) viewpoint. I would give the book more than 5 stars if it was possible. I have to add that it's a lot easier to comprehend and appreciate for an African-born/raised person. Diop (as always) shined on this one!	2004-03-07

I just finished reading the book. I have to say it was an interesting read. At some points however, I did feel like Malidoma was adding his own embellishments to compensate for all the other material that Guisso did not want him to reveal (I might be wrong). The book is an example of how the coming of colonization has changed all facets of life in Africa. Certain interesting features of the cultures have been obliterated. The author makes the point that \\"the (Western) book has totally replaced the elder\\". Africans are just as culpable in this respect in my opinion.    I agree that the kidnapping of Malidoma can partially be blamed on the father, who befriended the missionaries, exposing the young Malidoma to vultures. I admire the way in which Patrice balanced the two worlds that had morphed him into what he was. He did it with admirable poise.	2004-03-06
