I was looking for a mystery and instead got a book that was obvious half way through as to the outcome and explanation.  No surprises here and not really any twists.  He regurgitates the book upon itself several times and the book is tedious at times.  I found I was anxious to finish to move on to a nonfiction book awaitng on my table. <br /> <br />Having been to Egypt, I find the book really lacking in descriptive quality of the Valley and the cities of Luxor and Cairo.  He fails to even mention the largest monument in the area, the Temple of Karnak with was well known in 1918.  His treatment of Egyptian religion is superficial.  <br /> <br />This could have been something special but the lack of local flavor and ancient historical accuracy leaves this book short of the mark.  The magnificent of Tut's sanctuary room and the sparsenes of the remainder is ignored.  This would have fed into the illusion  of Trillipush's empty tomb.  The wonder of Rameses II and IV's tombs and Tutmoses' would have increased the anticpation of the reader.  He missed so much.  one wonders if he actually went there or wrote from a travel magazine.	2004-09-21

The characters are unsympathetic and one dimensional.  I labored to read this book because of my affection for what Stephenson has done before.  However, this book is a diaster of unimaginable proportions.  Three years to write this.  <br />William Martin does a better job describing the emotional impact of the plague in 20 pages in Harvard Yard than Stephenson does in over 100.  A total waste of words and wood pulp.  Is it possible for me to convey my anger at having sacrificed far too many days with this worthless book published solely on the merits of the authors previous works which are high?  <br />The thought of two more volumes before something of value is again published has put me off Stephenson.	2003-12-23

Patterson gives us nothing new as to who Cross is.  He has been robotic in the last novels.  The &quot;split&quot; novel of Roses and Violets seems to repeat itself here with an unsolved crime and a bad guy on the loose..... to be continued. Ican only give it one star because its a Cross novel but very little else.  I'd rather he abandon the character than toture him to death with these less than honest efforts.  Robert PArker has kspt Spencer fresh and entertaining a lot longer than Cross has been around.	2003-12-17

His historical \\"then and now\\" narrative gives the reader a unique sense as to how the past is always intertwined with the now.  <br />While the multi-narrated style of Citizen Washington worked well, it is in this form that Mr.Martin seems most insightful.  Like Back Bay and Cape Cod, Mr. Martin covers familiar ground.  <br />At first, I thought the topic could be too parochial for mass consumption.  However, after reading the novel, I realized this is not just the story of the history of one institution in Boston, but is a metaphor for the evolution of education in America.  Harvard has been a leader and innovator in the American style of college education.  Mr.Martin expertly shows how innovation need not scacrifice tradition.<br />As always, Mr. Martin is able to pull pertinent history of the times to his central story.  As always, I learned much.<br />For those with a Harvard connection, this is a must read.  For those who are interested in the history of American education, this book will fill your plate.  And for those who just enjoy reading, this is a treat	2003-10-20

I read the books months ago in the first printing and immediately told everyone I knew to read it.  Its simply the most entertaining book of the year.  Is it accurate? Not 100%, but then again Eco's works on the history of the church while far more tedious are not 100% accurate either.  If anyone had bothered to read any other works by Brown they would know that being 100% accurate loses out to entertainment at times.  This is a work of fiction.  That means he made it up.  As Gore Vidal says, you can do and say anything in fiction because its not real.  If you want to battle through tedium (I have) read Eco, but don't beieve all of it.

Littell goes to great lengths to &quot;martyrize&quot; the Leo and Yvgeny characters while denigrating the characters of the CIA.  He ignores the basic truth of the CIA.  If they do their job well, no one will ever know they have done anything at all. He spotlights the more public failings.  He raises the Russian figures to mythical status.  CIA failing are ineptness, KGB failings are because of betrayal or fate. <br />Littell hangs out the dirty laundry of the CIA.  There are stars on the wall at Langley and each one represents an agent lost doing his duty.  This book is an insult to the memory of the men who stood guard on a lonely frontier.  <br />I take issue with the portrayal of the drunken, naive, overvealous cowboy image of the CIA operatives.  I take issue with the cool efficiency and meticulous performance of the KGB operatives.  One must wonder how we won with this cast of characters.<br />Its good that Littell is living in France, a country that has had to be bailed out or lost every conflict since the American Revolution usually by Britain or America.  With their current view on world matters, I'd say Littell and the French deserve one another	2003-03-13

Irving disappoints me on just about every level.  The characters are essentially one dimensional and static.  One could see every plot twist long before it arrived.  One reason I continued to read was that I was waiting for Irving to surprise me.  He never did.  <br />The Fourth Hand borrows from just about every other book he's written with nothing new to offer.  I got the sense that Irving was filling the quota of a book contract and we'll see his next effort with a new publisher.  It's either that or Irving has chosen to rest on his laurels.  <br />I thought A Widow For One Year a stunning comeback from the abysmal Son Of The Circus.  However, with this effort I have to begin to wonder if Irving has lost his will to write.  Shallow characters, predictable plots and unresolved subplots just left me unfulfilled as a reader.	2001-10-15

Cross.  I have dearly loved the Alex Cross series.  Each book has stood on its own and resolved its plot line logically and had closure.  This book has neither.  <br />The ending is off the wall.  I felt violated as a reader that there were no clues leading to this unbelieveable conclusion.  There is no closure.  The reader is just left hanging for the sequel which hopefully will explain this pitiful ending.  <br />Paterson has broken his trust with his readership.  The story doesn't stand alone.  If one hasn't read Pop Goes the Weasal, then he is in the dark.  If he has read Kiss the Girls, then the ending is a real sucker punch to the intellect.  <br />Alex Cros was like the melodies he plays on his piano, classics.  This one is just plain off key.  I've lost a lot of respect for Mr. Patterson.  I thought he wrote for reasons other than commercial success.  Obviously, I am mistaken.  Don't waste you time on this book.  <br />His editors didn't do him any favors either by letting him get away with such a weak effort.	2001-03-19

Its called Wishing You Well by David Baldacci.  He normally writes thrillers like Absolute Power, however, this time he steps out of his genre to write a really beautiful character novel.  If you've read his other stuff as I have, it will take you 50 - 75 pages to realize that this is a special book.  It's one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I like character novels now so take my praise in that light.  It's a wonderful read.  The characters touch something way down inside of me.

However having found one reader who hailed the book, I perservered, never again!<br />Why Doctorow would want to share his obvious midlife crisis is beyond me.  This is not a book about self realization and discovery as much as it is about lamentation and confusion.  Impossible to follow as a stream of subconsciousness, those who &quot;love&quot; the book will say its too deep and complex for the reader who dismisses it.  They will use terms such as post modern and innovative.  In reality, its a simple book about the confusion we all feel as midlife passes us by and we question what all of it has meant.  Doctorow doesn't have any of the answers. He just keeps repeating the questions.<br />This book failed on just about every level for me.  It didn't make me uncomfortable or reflective.  It only made me wonder if Doctorow has sought professional help yet or not.  I too have these questions but appparently I'm more comfortable with the uncertainty of the answers.<br />Well all great writers are allowed a loser.  Even Shakespeare wrote &quot;Titus Adronicus&quot;.  Perhaps like &quot;Titus&quot;, &quot;City&quot; will gain cult status on academic campuses where it will be hailed as a classic post modern work reflective on the origins of the universe, man, religion and other great questions.

Having read the other six first created some disappointment for me in this book.  It is a well told story that moves the reader along at a gentle relaxed paced and challenges many of the themes that Gordon's later works also take on. Yet, I found myself wanting to know more about these people than Gordon gives us.  Therefore, I cared less.  I needed to know more about Michael and his break with Orthodoxy.  Why Reform when the strongest influences in his life were Orthodox?  Even Laslie's Orthodox conversion raises this question.<br />The relationship between Leslie and her minister father is only sketched out while Michael's relationship with Leslie's father is almost skipped completely.<br />The subtext of Michael wrestling with his Orthodox origins is almost lost.  Michael Rivkind becomes Michael Kind for commericial reasons but then become Reb Kind which phonetically reaches back to his Orthodox origins.  That his final temple is one wrestling with the question of Reform vs Orthodox is only fitting. Yet we are never told why Michael wrestles with the question.<br />The story is well told and enjoyable, but by the standards Gordon sets in his later works, incomplete.  He does introduce us to some of the mysteries of Judaism.  While not a coming of age or identity book as strong as Potok's works, it is a story worth reading.  It demonstrates the promise of his future works.<br />Like Matters of the Heart, he at times gets bogged down in personal biases and the story goes off track.  Perhaps, this is why his historical novels are true epics and the contemporary pieces seem to wander off point.<br />I may well have rated it higher if I had read it first before The Physician, Shaman, and The Last Jew.  Its stronger than Death Committee and Matters of the Heart. and a nice precedent to Jerusalen Diamond.  The body of work as a whole is outstanding with great books and strong stories.

He returns to familiar themes and rhythms in The Last Jew. Stylistically he borrows much  from both master works The Physician and Shaman.  While the themes and  rhythms of the book are familiar Gordon brings forth a compelling new story  that entertains from beginning to end.  Perhaps Gordon is somewhat of a  nomad, for it is the wanderings of his characters that they take form.   <br />The Last Jew paints a vivid picture of one of Christianity's darker  moments, yet in the end shows how the goodness of a person can triumph over  even the greatest obstacles.  Yonah Toledano discovers the cruelty of  Christianity as an institution bent to serve other purposes.  He discovers  the true Christianity in the hearts of those who take him into their lives.   The irony of the book lies in the affirmation of all faiths, Judaism,  Christianity, and Islam through the instrument of the Spanish  Inquisition.<br />The book is about the triumph of the soul, about keeping  faith and promises and about never forgetting whom you are.  Shorter by a  great deal than The Physician and Shaman, it would be an excellent primer  for the new Gordon reader before tackling the more complex but equaling  compelling trilogy.<br />Thank you Mr. Gordon.	2000-08-08

After reading Cryptonomicron, I thought I had found a new breed of  sci-fi writer.  Snow Crash was an interesting first step but clearly not  the sophisticated production that Cryto is.  Diamond Age fits no where in  between either thematically or structurally.  Stephenson falls back on the  old sci-fi bromide that creates a future where they have superior  technology but it adds nothing to the world the people live in.  The  characters live a less convenient life than we do yet have at their  disposal technology to do away with all the ills of day to day life.   Riding chevalines (horses) for God sake is but one instance of the banal  existence these people subject themselves to and riding in airships  (zeplins).<br />Maybe I don't get this genre but Asimov certainly did it  better.  He took today's technology and projected it into the future to  show us how things could be.  Stephenson throws out today to create a  tomorow that's worse than the past.  This isn't science fiction. Its just a  disppointment. The promise of Snow Crash realized in Crypto is lost in this  book.	2000-08-04

By having Burr tell his  own story and having Charlie Schuyler fail at finding a realistic middle  ground the book is greatly flawed.<br />Inexplicably, Vidal leaves several  unresolved theories on the table.  Since these involve true historical  figures, Vidal should have resolved them to leave history intact.  He  doesn't and that is taking too much journalistic license.  While Vidal may  assert that all things in fiction are possible (read Duluth), history  should not be changed by the swirl of a pen.<br />This book was recommended to  me by someone with excellent historical credential.  I wonder why.  More  importantly, I wonder why so many others are not bothered by this most  flawed worked. <br />Historical fiction works best when the story is built  around the history not when the history is perverted to tell a story.	2000-07-16

Crichton didn't hurt himself doing too much research on France circa 1000,  but the ending is unbelievable.

The first Grisham novel I consider as more than filler between serious books since the re-release of A Time to Kill.   His books had gotten monotonous.

This book is the perfect  example.  An easily told tale that is fast paced and not at all thought  provoking.  I'm glad he broke his formula after Street Lawyer and the last  two books have been definite improvements.  <br />While not nearly the book A  Time to Kill is, its clearly better than his anti-death penalty crusade of  The Chamber.  Of the highs and low of Grisham's works, this one fits in the  middle, thus three stars.  <br />He'll probably sulk all the way to the bank  with his studio check.  This like almost all his recent books read more  like a screen play than a novel.  I wish he would show the talent that  wrote A Time to Kill Again.	2000-07-07

He  does an accurate job for 1969 when the book was published.<br />I expected  more incite to the characters.  Having read his wonderful later works  first, my expectations were high.  Trying to put this in perspective as a  second novel, it showcases Gordon's development as a character writer.   <br />It is a clever quick read and highly recommended for those who like  Gordon's later works, but I would read the later works first.	2000-06-20

Harrigan chooses to show all the heroes of Texas with all their  warts and in the end fails to acknowledge what a loosely organized band of  malcontents managed to accomplish.  <br />I'm not a native Texan but I have  taken the time to learn the history of the state.  While everything  Harrigan says about Bowie, Crockett, Travis, Houston and Austin is correct,  it is incomplete.  These were men of great courage and vision.  Did Houston  fight a different war than Washington did against the Brisish? No.   Washington knew the only important battle to win was the last one and if he  could stretch the enemies supply lines then cut them off he would  eventually win.  Houston's &quot;reluctance&quot; to engage Santa Anna  until the Mexicans were demoralized and had no supply lines is the same  battle.  <br />The fact that Bowie was a drunken philanderer doesn't change  the fact that he was a brilliant motivator of men.  The fact that Crockett  was more politian than warrior doesn't detract from the spirit he brought  to the battle.  Travis was young but he inspired men to follow him to a  hell called the Alamo and make a stand for independence.  <br />Harrigan does  Texas history a grave injustice.  Let us not forget names like Lee,  Jefferson, Hamilton, Lafite without whom we would still be british citizen.   They were as far from perfect as the Texas heroes were.<br />As a book I  found the plot drawn out and overly complicated.  Too many subplots that  failed to tie in with the story or add to character development.  Most  disappointing were the characters themselves.  I found I cared little for  Mary, McGown, Terrell, or any of the other minor fictious characters.   Beyond destroying the reputations of some great men because of their human  weaknesses, he fails to develop one sympathetic character except maybe theparrot.	2000-06-04

The disappointment was that it wasn't and epic like the first two.  Now sweeping history of the time and culture.  Perhaps because it was so contemporary, Mr Gordon thought he could foregoe  the historical development and character development so central in the  first two volume. He was wrong if that is true.<br />He allows himself the  freedom of not being constrained by history and he actually begins to  almost preach on certain subjects.  He is  obviously disappointed by the  failure of HMO's, the failure to pass universal healthcare, the real  physical pitfalls of abortion as well as the real social threats involved.  He wants it all to work out.<br />As a physician, to me the book played like a  three cord song instead of the symphonies of his other work.  HE clearly is  some one I would love to talk to though.<br />Matters is clearly worth  reading.  Its much better than most of these reviewers allow.  It shouldn't  be downgraded simply because it falls short of what people expected.  If  you read the first two parts of the trilogy, then you owe it to yourself to  finish the circle and read Matters.<br />I would have given it four stars  except for the ove abundance of liberal rhetoric that he should have worked  out better before writing the story.  Instead he gnaws on the failures of  his beliefs in the book and one grows weary.	2000-03-27

As a physician there is much to learn about the history of my profession, however, this story transcends the history.  The characters are vivid and as in Rob J vol.I Gordon  displays honestly characters with all their warts and makes us like them  anyway.  For me, this wasn't Shaman as much as it was Rob J.  One of the  best reads in quite some time.  It is a story that sets its own tempo and  one you won't want to rush through.  I revisited many parts of the book  while reading it.  It won't be the last time I read it.  I have added the  hard cover to my permanent library.  I encourage everyone to read both The  Physician first than Shaman.  Don't be daunted by the size of the books.   Every page is a delight. <br />Ferrol Sams' Whisper of the River is the only  sequel I have ever read that surpassed the original.

As a  physician, I was spellbound by a history too often not taught.  The lessons  in religious tolerance and intolerance thrown in along the way were a  bonus.  A solid read for any history buff.

Crypto was one of the ten best books to appear last year, but is a quantum leap forward as a novel.  Snow Crash may have put  Stephenson on the science fiction map but I but I'm not sure on which  remote corner he appears.  The characters are poorly developed, and their  relationships even more poorly constructed. Hiro Protagonist turns out not  to be the real hero in the end anyway (perhaps that is why his name is  spelled incorrectly).  The whole premise of the book is a little too  bizarre for my personal taste.  <br />Parts of the book were amazingly well  done.  The Sumerian and Babel sections epecially, but the story didn't make  me root for Hiro or against Raven.  I really didn't care who won.  In the  end the real villain, Rife, gets so little attention as to be a mere add  on.  The ultimate hero Uncle Enzo is incompletely developed. <br />I loved  Crypto and perhaps my expectations were too high.

The lengths to which he goes to separate fact from fiction only highlights what I believe to be the true weakness of the book, that Safire is himself  scandalmongering.  By dragging us through the human frailaties of Adams,  Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Hamilton and Burr, Safire's inuendo is that  there is little difference between politics and personalities then and now.   Also, there is little difference between partisan press then and now.<br />I  don't buy his argument.  The ideologues of the early 19th century were  fighting to shape the character of an infant nation.  History has lionized  these men as the Founding Fathers.  The truth that they were far from  perfect humans and driven by common impulses of humanity does not detract  from what these men on both sides accomplished.  <br />Throughout the book  there is an undercurrent that today's scandals actually pale by comparison  to these early issues.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Today's  scandals do not occur on a backdrop of a nation stuggling to define itself.  Rather they showcase an individual possessed with more power than anyone  else on earth abusing the charisma of his office for self  gradification.<br />I'll give the book 5 stars for accuracy, subtract one for  duplicity and one for his own scandalmongering.	2000-02-12

The story has a steady metered pace about it that causes  reflection on past events and current day events.  While Mr. Martin may not  agree,  the struggle for independence in Ireland mirrors the American  struggle a century and a half before, but also foreshadows the struggles of  the Palestinians for a home land today.  <br />The book explores the deep  nationalistic sentiments that drive a people towards independence.   Demonstrating how passionate those drives may be and how at times those  passions cause unintended pain and grief that time can't erase.  <br />I think  he toys with the notion that the end does not always justify the means, but  in the end leaves the reader to decide.  At times a very disturbing book,  yet always captivating and provocative, the ending will surprise you<br />This  book should not have been removed from the shelves of bookstores,  The  novice William Martin reader will be deprived of perhaps his most personal  essay on independence, the central theme in his works.  For those of you  who have enjoyed the historical tails of Martin, make the extra effort to  find a copy of &quot;Rising&quot;.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  You will be challenged though.	1999-10-12

Martin demonstrates his story telling  ability without relying on history as a frame work.  I was hooked from the  first chapter and plowed through the near 500 page book in less than two  days.  Martin displays an uncanny abilty to lead the reader in one  direction then turning the plot quickly almost 180 degrees while  maintaining the integrity of the story.  More than once I was totally  surprised.  It made for a most enjoyable read.<br />For fans of Martin's more  contemporary works this is an enjoyable change of pace, yet shows all the  craftmanship in storytelling we have come to expect from Martin.  <br />While  the best known works of Martin are historical, this book may accurately be  classified as premonition.  Published in 1984, Martin accurately predicts  what has become a core problem in American society.  If for no other reason  the book should be read for this, but it is a great story.	1999-09-19

He also manages also to so us once again that these were people and not icons. While fiction, it is easy to visualize the petty argumnets and personality struggles within this  group that most of us assume was a cohesive unit with a united purpose.   Using his now familiar device of switching back and forth from now and  then, Martin paints a living picture of the early history of the Cape.   This was the last of Martin's books that I read prior to Citizen  Washington.  I hesitated because I thought the topic limited but I ended  learning and enjoying a compelling history of a special niche in American  history.<br />Martin demonstrates an uncanny ability to tell the great stories  (Annapolis - US Navy) a the small (Cape Cod) and make them breathe.	1999-09-10

I have since read everything except the out of print &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;.  Growing up just miles from Annapolis, the title drew me in while I was looking for a  casual read.  Boy was I wrong.  From the beginning I was enraptured with  the history of the US Navy and the people who made it the greatest force  afloat.  His familiar style of telling a history now and then until the  complete historical fabric is woven is an entertaining vehihcle that  maintains the relevance of the material.  For Martin, history is more than  a collection of dates. It lives and he breathes life into it for his  readers.  <br />The sequence in the South Pacific haunts me even now two years  after reading the novel. Martin ably carries on the traditon of historical  story telling from Michener.  He has demonstrated the ability to paint on  the large canvas (Annapolis), the small canvas (Cape Cod) and the personal  canvas (Citizen Washington).<br />I look forward to learning more about my  country and its heroes great and small from Martin in the future. <br />I  loved this book and recommend it as a must read.  Books like this should be  mandated in schools however the stark nature of reality would keep this  book out of curricula.  Instead, students will continue to learn fabled  accounts of how America came to be.  It would be so much better if children  were taught that some fairly ordinary people with faults like us came  together and became something extrordinary.  This is what Martin does best.	1999-09-10

He capably wears the mantle passed down from Michener as story telling historian.  He makes us want to learn history.  His stories are living entities not a collection of memorized dates.  Back Bay carries on  the tradition of Cape Cod in both educating and entertaining the reader.   This is an art he has refined in Annnapolis and Citizen Washington.  While  I loved Michener, I often found his introduction a bit laborious.  Martin  immediately immerses the reader in the story and pulls you along with such  compelling force that one rarely knows when to one can take a break.   Having live in Boston, I learned more intwo days of reading than in the 3  years of living.  From South Boston to the Commons and Beacon Hill, this  story brings one of America's first cities alive.

Like Michener and Vidal in earilier years, Martin is able to bring history alive and shsow us that history is a story and not a recitation of dates so often taught in school.   Accurately researched and presented in wonderful detail, Martin sets about  doing what Hesperus asks Christopher to do.  Find Washington the human.  At  first I was conflicted reading a narrative that showed Washington as a man  with feet of clay like all of us.   By the the end of the book I admired  Washington more because he was human.  By the same devices used on  Washington, Martin begins to show us how all the Founding Fathers may be  more like us than different or better.  I have read all of Martin's novels.  Annapolis is by far my favorite but I can't think of any of his historical  works that would merit less than 5 stars.  Another reviewer wished that  this book could be used in a schools curriculum.  I wished all his books  would become standard.  There are fewer literary licenses taken in Martin's  works than there are errors in current history books. <br />I went to  Washington College in Maryland, a school founded by a financial donation  from George in 1782.

It would have been better if he could  have included sound scientific evidence that this was a plausible plot.  He  didn't.  Making an illiterate time warped hippie the nemesis of the FBI and  having him always a step in front of them even to the end is a hard sell.  Unlike James Patterson where his nemesis , Sonegi, is a cerifiable genius  and wacko.  Preist is just a wacko.  I began to believe he cultivated four  leaf clover instaed of grapes.

After three hundred and fifty rather tedious pages of character development, Mr. Wolfe finally nudges the story ever so slowly forward.   With only 60 pages left the plot is still immature and despite exhaustive  efforts, the characters are still transparent,their motivation  unfathomable.  The resolution of this epic  (any novel over 700 pages) is  totally unbelieveable and leaves the reader scratching his head.  Unlike  the more believeable though equally dislikeable characters in Bonfires of  the Vanities,  these people are too stereotypic. Then the book resolves  with all the character acting out of character.  Of the twenty five books  I've read this year, the worst by far.  While I live in the South now, I  grew up in the Northeast.

WIdow is a nice recovery but falls short of his best efforts in Hotel New Hampshire and Owen meany.  Irving teaches us little new about the human condition and fraility that epitomize his best work.  The story is well constructed but at times way too predictable.  Still it was a nice tale, although his characters are beginning to look more and more alike.  Marion would have fit into Garp, Cider House, or Hotel NH.  Eddy could have gone to school with Garp.  Ruth could fit any of the books.  I guess my main disappointment is the lack of uniquenes in the story and characters.  Then again my disaapointment in Son of the Circus was that they were a bit too unique.  There' a fine line between success and failure.  I think Irving succeeds here but I'm hoping for better next time.  At four years per novel, my expectations are high.	1998-07-17
