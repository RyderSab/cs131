This is commercial pulp fantasy to the core. It rips off Tolkien and a slew of other authors, and the long, drawn out series often resembles a soap opera. You could skip a book and not miss out on too much, if you know what I mean. The earlier books are better, because by the end, Eddings seems to be running low on ideas and the mysteries of the world he creates have largely been explained. This will satisfy fantasy fans desire for another hit after reading The Lord of the Rings, but it's ultimately a pale imitation.<br />So, quality schlock it is.	2002-04-26

In journalism school, you are taught that you should show, not tell. This is more tell, not show. <BR>One welcome exception is some beautiful photos/illustrations showing how the scenes were created to match the visions of illustrators John Howe and Alan Lee. <BR>There is also clearly an element of not wanting to spoil the movie, too -- the author is careful not to give away too much of the plot, beyond the basic outlines that you will find in any review.<br />All in all, this makes a great keepsake of the movie, just so long as you realize that it has been scrubbed thoroughly by the PR folks.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-10

This often hilarious book (I listened to the excellent unabridged casette narrated by William Roberts, not Mr. Bryson) is perfect for Americans with an interest in merry old England (or Scotland for that matter) and its many bizarre quirks. It's also a treat for Brits who want a different take on their homeland. Since my father is English but my mother American, it was great fun for the whole family, despite the rather frequent use of profanity.<br />I suppose I should also warn you that Bryson is a bit of a grump, and if this book is wholely truthful, he must be one of the absolute worst travel planners in world history. He seems to find only hapless hotels and seedy dives along the way. (If his guidebook was so bad, you'd think he'd buy a second). He's also an extreme cheapskate. So mark, this is NOT a travel guide. This is rather more of an anti-travel guide with humorous misadventures.<br />Along the way we learn that:<BR>1) Bryson really, really hates modern architecture and really, really loves old stuff (even when it turns out to be fake).<BR>2) Bryson really, really hates cars and parking lots and really, really loves trains, especially ones that serve no known purpose.<br />One other criticism: Bryson seems convinced that we, the reader, are fascinated by HIS idiosyncracies and weirdnesses, sometimes to the point of tedium. But he is not the story, the small island is. That's why this only gets 4 stars.	2001-10-11

Robinson gets the science fairly right in this plodding sci-fi series, but the story he tells is largely unmoving and the characters themselves tend to the cardboard cutouts that are the bane of decent science fiction. The terraforming Mars idea has been done many times, and often better. This one, however, is longer.<br />The best part of the series is the specifics of the science, especially in this first book. I agree with others that Robinson seems to run out of decent ideas in his sequels, often killing off characters, including some of the most interesting ones, for seemingly no purpose. Also, there is also a whole semi-immortality thing going on that eventually grows tiresome.<br />BTW, having recently read The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, I found that to be a far more meaningful work, even though the science itself was preposterous. Bradbury's stories have far more human truth, and are far more literary, than Red Mars and others of its ilk. And they come in at several hundred fewer pages.	2001-10-09

After listening to the excellent Book-On-Tape version of this book, I was depressed for a week. So why am I giving it five stars? Because this book and its characters affected me so much, this book literally forced me to reexamine the relationships in my own life.<br />You surely know the basic story, from the Amazon description if from nowhere else. This is a depiction of a sick, but not unfathomable society. Science has advanced to the point where homes are constructed in such a way that they cannot burn, unless the fire is intentional. Firemen still exist, but they are only called out to burn books, and the houses (and sometimes people) that contain and love them.<br />The concept is chilling, but the psychological effects of such a super-paranoid society are what I could not get out of my head. Guy Montag is a fireman, has been for decades. But in the back of his mind is an itch, that little spark of human curiosity that hasn't quite been burned out of him yet. He meets a girl, Clarisse, who isn't like all of the other people left in the world. She laughs, and doesn't conform, and challenges him with thoughts that she could not have gotten from the ubiquitous video walls that occupy most people's lives.<br />Guy's curiosity is stoked, and adventures ... somewhat depressing adventures, ensue ...<br />By the end of this chilling and frightening experience (which includes, by the way, scarily prescient &quot;Reality television&quot; shows a la Stephen King's The Running Man or Fox's Cops), like I said, I was depressed for a week. But I also found myself listening more to people, turning off the television to spend time with my wife, and ultimately inspired to stop being such a go-with-the-flow zombie that our shrink-wrapped culture demands.	2001-09-21

The characters are interesting at first, but over the course of the series you get awfully sick of some of the repetitive dialogue and some of the annoying relationships. This is more like General Hospital than The Lord of the Rings...There are lots and lots of pages that could have been easily edited out of this series, but it seems like Jordan is getting paid by the word.<br />As far as the story, it's standard fantasy schlock with a few twists (don't they all have a few twists?):<br />1) A select few people have the ability to &quot;channel the One Power&quot; (i.e., do magic).<BR>2) The young people with the power whine a lot about &quot;why me.&quot;<BR>3) The personification of evil threatens to take over the world.<BR>4) One young man in particular holds the key to defeating Mr. Evil.<BR>5) Adventures ensue.<br />Some of the twists include the fact that women are the true powers through the first books, because men have been forbidden from using magic because they &quot;broke the world&quot; (see the Belgariad)...<br />This is definitely skippable, but if you want an escapist fantasy soap opera, this will do the trick. By the end, you will be wanting to use the One Power too.	2001-09-17

Card returns to his roots with his most compulsively readable novel since, well, Ender's Game. Told from the point of view of the genetically engineered Bean, this story is an echo of Ender's Game that is nearly as fascinating as that classic (my favorite SF novel ever).<br />This can't have been too hard a novel for Card to write. After all, we already know the basics of the plot. He merely had to fill in the back-story of Bean's upbringing and give Bean certain challenges to overcome. Where Ender has Valentine, Bean has Sister Carlotta. Where Ender has Peter, Bean has Achilles, a brilliant thug from his youth as a street urchin.<br />Through Bean's eyes, we see the power of Ender wasn't just in his keen intellect, it was in his ability to lead and to love. Bean himself lacks some of those human qualities, and he knows it.<br />All in all, a must-read for lovers of Ender's Game, and easily the second most-enjoyable book in the series.<br />(As others have noted, Xenocide and Children of the Mind were not up to the standards of the earlier works, alas)...	2001-09-17

This is one of the better jobs of it, too. Basically you are talking your standard pulpy epic fantasy novel here, complete with Allanon (see Gandalf), Shea Ohmsford (see Bilbo Baggins without the cleverness, cuteness or the wit), Skull Bearers (see Black Riders), various heroic warriors, a character of pure evil masterminding armies of evil-things while living in a faraway fortress (see Sauron and Mordor) and adventures along the way.<br />The Elfstones of Shannara, book two in the first trilogy, is actually my favorite Terry Brooks novel by far -- his most original, his most poignant and I feel his best written. That book can also be read independent of the other Shannara books, which, IMHO, have become lamer and lamer over the years.

Asimov's writing style focuses on the story, not the jargon, so you never get bogged down. The hero is Hari Seldon, who is able to scientifically predict the future (don't ask how), and he knows that the vast Galactic Empire is soon headed for the dustbin of history...Hari, the prophet that he is, endeavors to shorten the time before another Galactic Empire can restore civilization to 1,000 years instead of 10,000 or 20,000...surely a worthy goal. This book will amaze you, will excite you and have you wanting more. It's fun and thoughtful at the same time...And, IMHO, these books get even better later on in the series.<br />This book, which is later linked to the Robots series, may also be one of the most influential sci-fi books ever.

One day, however, the most magical thing ever happens to him -- he wins one of the five golden tickets to the nearby Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. <br />This is a wonderful book in so many ways, but especially in modern American suburbs where children often grow up spoiled with riches. This book shows them that, yes, some children grow up too poor for chocolate bars, and also shows them how loathesome spoiled children of various types are. There is the obnoxious bubble gum chewer, the TV-obsessed kid and the glutton.<BR>Willy Wonka teaches each of them -- and the reader -- a valuable lesson.<br />On top of that, it is such a fun story -- with amazing candies that will delight children of all ages (including their parents).<br />Every child should read this book, or have it read to them. It is absolutely the best children's book ever written. I can give it no higher recommendation.	2001-09-04

Ender has transformed over the eons from a child-general into a sort of new-age minister. His ministry is to combine the healing power of brutal honesty with a loving heart. Fascinating, thought-provoking stuff. Card's second-best novel, after Ender's Game. Just don't read it expecting Ender's Game Redux. The action is far more subdued here, and it is about personal relationships and prejudice more than spaceships and buggers (although they are still around). Definitely read this, but take your time. You probably won't be reading this at 4 a.m. like you were with Ender's Game, if you know what I mean... After this, the Ender novels start drifting into four star territory, until the arrival of Ender's Shadow (5 star story of Bean's journaey from childhood to Battle School).	2001-08-28

Once again Thomas Covenant returns to the land, which has been ravaged in the wake of the Illearth War. He must finally come to terms with the rape of Lena, with his leprosy and with The Land. Ultimately, the book is about how even a leper can fight off despair -- or can he? If he can redeem his own sorry self, he can redeem The Land. After the high of the Illearth War, the best of the series, the Power that Preserves is more subdued and philosophical, but you will not be disappointed...After you savor the end of the series for about a year, give the second series a shot. It's not as good, but still far superior to the schlock pervading fantasy shelves nowadays.	2001-08-28

Sci-fi lovers who like Card because of his Ender books may be a little frustrated by the change of pace here, but Card is a master story teller, and this book is one of his most intimate, beautiful works. It's a story about a boy named Alvin Maker, who has extraordinary, perhaps even religious, capabilities. The saga of Alvin Maker is uplifting and powerful, set in a far different America in the time of cowboys and Indians. In some ways, Alvin (surprise) resembles Ender Wiggin. Definitely a must for Card fans and lovers of fantasy fiction.	2001-08-28

Definitely Card's B-material here. I'd recommend reading the Ender novels first, then Seventh Son and the Alvin Maker novels, with this last, even after some of his other novels. This series is based on an interesting idea -- that all of humanity has been relocated to the Planet Harmony -- with a computer overseeing human society for 40 million years. But the computer is breaking down, so she sends a small band back to Earth to recolonize it. Anyway, as with all Card novels, the characters are the fun part, and Nafai is yet another incarnation of the Ender character, only he's somewhat of a pale imitation, IMHO. These novels have more of a soap-opera-like, pulpy feel to them than your typical Card novels.	2001-08-28

The Mote in God's Eye has to be the best title in the history of Science Fiction. Anyway, this novel of the far future when mankind is well on its way to colonizing the galaxy, is hard SF with the conventions thereof. There is the hard-charging battle-scarred captain with a sensitive side. There is the uber-Military admiral with the crusty exterior and the soft middle. There is the female xenobiologist who tries to explain alien psychology (and is often wrong). There are the requisite explanations of what far future human society has become. But the real stars of this book are the Moties, a race as alien and yet not alien as possible. I won't explain that duality here, as that could spoil one of the great joys of this book. The aliens may be the most ingenious ever imagined by man, and they present all sorts of problems, physical and philosophical, for the humans who come upon them. Is it kill or be killed? Or can we negotiate with them? In the end, the answer isn't the easy answer you would get from Star Trek. As far as the writing itself, don't expect literature here. This is about cool aliens, man!	2001-08-27

Look, this is a sequel folks, and like nearly all sequels, it loses some of the magical mystery of First Contact.

It's a question that keeps getting repeated over and over again in real life, between warring societies...Just look at Israel now, and the people they consider &quot;aliens&quot; -- the Palestinians. Only the Moties, with their stratospheric evolutionary and reproductive rates, present the greatest possible risk. Besides that single question, this is more of a flat-out adventure book, with lots more hard SF stuff thrown in...

Unlike most SF, this one will get you in your heart, as well as your mind. It's just about the perfect novel. Start with: Ender Wiggin. A child bred for military intelligence and empathy, his abilities and his emotions wrestle throughout the novel. His job: Save the world from an alien race intent on destroying earth. Add: His brilliant yet sadistic brother, Peter, his brilliant yet overly emotional sister, Valentine, who plot to take over the world. Add: The Battle School -- a brutal, ascetic environment in space for training 5-year-olds on up how to become space commanders. Add: An unbelievable cast of child-warriors, with emotions so real, so visceral that you will remember them for all time. Add: A plot that starts off great, and keeps accelerating until it reaches a crescendo -- with a twist. Add: All this told by a master storyteller unmatched in his ability to mold the conventions of hard sci-fi with complex, rich characters that never feel like cardboard cutouts. After reading this novel the first time, I felt exhilarated and drained. Then I read it again. It was that good. Read the rest of the novels in the series, too, although they get progressively weaker. Ender's Shadow, however, is more on a par with Ender's Game. This is my favorite SF novel ever. I can't give it any higher recommendation.	2001-08-27

It's that good. Continuing the story from Lord Foul's Bane, the reluctant anti-hero leper Thomas Covenant returns to the mysterious Land, where he is again called upon to save it even as he must deny its existence to try and maintain his sanity. Of course, there is the added twist that he doesn't even know how to use the awesome power of the white gold wedding band at his wrist, even if he wanted to. Meanwhile, in the &quot;real world,&quot; life is getting even tougher for Covenant. The forces of evil are at work in both worlds, with a titanic war splitting the Land and threatening to destroy it utterly. It's rare these days for a fantasy to be truly fantastic. Too often, hacks like David Eddings or Terry Brooks simply recycle plots from their earlier days and write hack and slash 'em pulp novels that are read one day and mind-flushed the next.<br />Donaldson's novels sear themselves into your brain, so that you remember them for years, decades after you last read them. The characters -- Foamfollower, the Bloodguard, Lord Mhoram, Lena -- each is deep and rich with emotional scars and a quiet strength and courage. Covenant in comparison can't help but appear bad, yet somehow, through his travels in the Land, he slowly, slowly manages to find his humanity again that had been stripped away by leprosy and VSE. If you haven't read the Covenant series, do yourself a favor and go read Lord Foul's Bane, then the Illearth War and the rest of the books. They are the treasure of modern fantasy.	2001-08-26

For the uninitiated, his travel philosophy is to travel better by traveling cheaper and closer to the people. If your idea of a dream vacation is sleeping on the eighth floor of a high-rise hotel for a fortune every night, this is the wrong book for you. If your idea of wonderful is to sleep in an exquisite four-poster bed at a Scottish B&B owned by a pleasant old lady who will talk to you for hours, all for [amt.] a night -- buy this book. Steves has three big strengths, which are all at work in this book: The most important, by far, is the accomodations. Steves consistently finds amazingly good buys among centrally located B&Bs with friendly owners. The only problem is that everybody knows this, so getting a room on short notice in the summer at one of his spots can be dicey. The second big strength is the practical guides to sights, which include lots of interesting little details that you won't find elsewhere while telling you in no-uncertain terms which sights are must sees and which ones you should skip. Over time, his picks may not always coincide with yours -- but I almost always found his stuff on-target. The third big-strength is Steves' travel philosophy, which is especially helpful to first-time travelers (or those venturing away from the Hilton for the first time). I highly recommend that you also check out Europe Through the Back Door, Steves' classic magnum opus, now in its 19th Edition.	2001-08-26

It's secret? It's written by students, mainly for students...It's strength is that it has a lot of truly budget accomodations listed -- hostels, etc. -- in practically every city in Europe. The main weakness? Because it is put together by students, who by definition are amateurs, the writing can sometimes be weak, the info can be out of date or wrong, and the reviews of lodging and sights are incredibly uneven. (For example, when I used Let's Go almost exclusively for a 3-month Europe trip, some of their $10-25/night budget accomodations listed were fantastic -- but others were dumps unworthy of a listing in any guidebook). The problem is that, unlike a Lonely Planet or a Rick Steves guidebook, which are written by professionals, Let's Go has had hundreds of writers over the years, with students writing about one country but not all the others...If you are unlucky enough to go to a country reviewed by Mountain Man Jack, for example, and he doesn't care about a lack of air conditioning, lumpy beds and smelly rooms, and fails to mention these items, you are out of luck. All in all, though, a great resource for people who need truly budget accomodations, with lots of good maps and other tips... I've personally outgrown this guidebook, having moved on to Rick Steves, who focuses not on the cheapest possible budget but on getting the most possible out of your trip...($50-$100 day vs. the $25-$50 that Let's Go specializes in).	2001-08-25

The Rue Cler district is Rick's specialty. He knows all of the inn's and the street like the back of his hand, and after you read his tips, you will too. Rick's system of rating the sights is largely on target, and his descriptions are concise and usually on target. (BTW our favorite Paris haunt: the Rodin museum.)

I really wasn't expecting much from this book, which I worried would be yet another cashing in on the Foundation franchise, but I was pleasantly surprised. Hari Seldon, Asimov's alter ego, shines again in this fascinating denouement to the Foundation story and to Asimov's career. The book reveals more about the fate of the robots, and of the humans, and has a more hopeful tone than some of Asimov's other works. There is something about the tone here that suggests he knew his time was running out, and he treats his master epic with the care it deserves. A great read.	2001-08-23

The Real Story is, frankly a disappointing start from a master storyteller like Donaldson. Maybe it took him one book to get out the kinks of switching from fantasy to Sci-Fi? This is a real departure from Donaldson's earlier work, although he keeps his focus on the darker impulses of humanity that marked his Covenant series.<br />However, the book is still enjoyable, and, more importantly, it introduces the sweeping Gap epic. This is the only series that I have read where the sequels are far superior to the original. The other Gap books keep getting better and better, leading up to a very satisfying climax -- in fact, taken as a whole, the Gap series is one of the most original and thought-provoking sci-fi works in years.<br />One annoying part of The Real Story is that it includes a lot of horrific brutality and torture, but it is required to set up the transcendent transformations in the following books in the series...<br />So my recommendation is, read it, with low expectations, and then get on with the sequels!	2001-08-23

This is one of the most fascinating explorations of man-alien contact, and even man-man contact, ever, if a bit dated.<br />When reading the Martian Chronicles (or, in my case, listening to the excellently read book on tape), the key is to keep in mind the context of the time in which it was written. In the post-war 1940s, the prospect of nuclear holocaust was all too real. More than 50 years later, the book is far too pessimistic about humanity and its future, while at the same time far too optimistic about the ease of travel to Mars.<br />Regardless, this is not the kind of science fiction that most are used to reading. For starters, it's a very literary book. The language is beautifully crafted; we're not talking pulp fiction here. Also, it's not a book about the rockets, or even Mars, per se. Bradbury spends no time explaining how the rockets are able to easily traverse the millions of miles to and from Earth, for example. It merely uses those conventions to tell incredibly poignant stories about man's paranoia and selfishness. One of the stories echoes the censorship-mad society in Fahrenheit 451, for instance. It just happens to occur on Mars.<br />The end result is somewhat depressing, yet profound. Think of the Martian Chronicles as the opposite of Star Trek's touchy feely Hollywoody SciFi.	2001-08-23

OK, so that's the plot of just about every Stephen King or Peter Straub novel. So, you know what you are getting.<br />This is one of the best. Fast paced, engrossing, thrilling, and frightening. Hard to put down, despite its girth.<br />If you are a King fan, this is one not to miss. To the uninitiated, this would be a good place to start.	2001-08-23

It rips off Tolkien and a slew of other authors, and the long, drawn out series often resembles a soap opera. You could skip a book and not miss out on too much, if you know what I mean. The earlier books are better, because by the end, Eddings seems to be running low on ideas and the mysteries of the world he creates have largely been explained. This will satisfy fantasy fans desire for another hit after reading The Lord of the Rings, but it's ultimately a pale imitation.<br />So, quality schlock it is.	2001-08-23

The plot involves an alien race, the Psychlos, who dominate the galaxies with their instantaneous teleportation technology...And sometime around the year 2000, they take over earth...1,000 years later, the few humans remaining on the planet fight back.<br />It's simply a rollicking good time. Don't read this looking for great literature. Read it for the adventure! Don't be intimidated by the 1,000 pages...Hubbard's writing style is extremely breezy--and you won't be able to stop reading, besides.<br />As far as this book being a fictionalized version of Scientology, it certainly contains many of the same elements, but it won't convert you or anything. Just treat it as a pulpy scifi epic and leave it at that!<br />I've read it four or five times already, so give it a shot.	2001-08-21

This is a classic and mind-blowing piece of hard science fiction, with the emphasis on the cool implications of the enormity of Ringworld. The characters tend toward the scifi cardboard cutouts familiar to the genre, but this is not to be missed for scifi fans.<br />A better Niven book for the characters, although not the science, is Footfall. Also check out the Mote in God's Eye, a fascinating look at a totally alien world.	2001-08-16

You will not be disappointed. In fact, with the possible exception of The Lord of the Rings, the Thomas Covenant series is the best the fantasy genre has to offer, bar none.<br />Compared to the melodramatic dreck that populates most modern fantasy pulp fiction, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, starting with Lord Foul's Bane, shines with originality, gut-wrenching emotions and drama.<br />The main character is Thomas Covenant, an author who develops leprosy and whose life in the &quot;real&quot; world is stripped of all that is good. Covenant then is transported by The Creator and The Despiser to travel to the Land, a magical place where leprosy does not exist and where Covenant strives not to go mad with his newfound health. <br />Brilliant. Contrary to one reviewer, who called the Chronicles dark and gave it three stars, that is far too simplistic a review. It's deep, not dark. For every heart-wrenching scene, there are an equal number of transcendent ones. By the end of the first (and best) series, you will find yourself entirely caught up in the Land, wishing that somehow you could be transported there.<br />In addition to Covenant, The Land is so utterly rich, so complex and so beautifully described, that you will never, ever forget it. Try finding a Piers Anthony novel that you remember ever detail of four months after you read it. I first read the Chronicles 15 years ago (and several times since) and they were imprinted onto my brain.<br />BTW, Donaldson's Gap series is also excellent (more of a sci-fi epic)... The Mirror of Her Dreams series is derivative fantasy sludge, however, so read it with low expectations.<br />My only disappointment, frankly, is that Donaldson hasn't written anything in years!	2001-08-15

Tired of SF novels that read like increasingly banal versions of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;? Well, Philip K. Dick is the cure for you. Each of his novels sets off on its own, wonderful meandering journey that takes you places you've never imagined, and Radio Free Albemuth is no exception.<br />The plot basically follows American History until the late 1960s, when a character named Fremont but actually a shell for Richard Nixon takes over the country by assassinating his rivals and proceeds to make a mockery of the Bill of Rights.<br />That's just the backdrop for a fascinating foray into the &quot;real&quot; meaning of the Bible, the Jesus story, and eternal life.<br />BTW, this book, at just over 200 pages, takes a while to read. There are no banal page-long descriptions of the weather, clothing, etc. a la a pulp fiction novel. It's rich with ideas from page to page, so it's not necessarily a page-turner. You have to stop and think about it -- best if read not all at once but a few chapters at a time.	2001-08-12

I had loved some other Heinlein novels -- mainly Stranger in a Strange Land and the Moon is a Harsh Mistress -- but this one let me down, bigtime.<br />The plot, for starters, is classic SF schlock -- the bug-like invaders vs. us for control of the galaxy, we can't communicate with them, etc.<br />The book follows one main character, a somewhat-dimwitted and self-deprecating soldier, through the war. There is a lot of preaching about the need to teach harsh lessons to children so they don't grow up to be criminals -- some of which is compelling, some appallingly callous and obtuse.<br />Heinlein creates a militaristic utopia where only veterans get to vote, and therefore crime is virtually nonexistent and everything is hunky-dory. Except, of course, for those bugs we have to go wipe out.<br />The society he creates is two-dimensional -- utopias tend to be -- and so are the characters. They don't grow or stretch any more than in your typical G.I. Joe cartoon episode.<br />This is a curiosity only for die-hard Heinlein fans and scholars.	2001-08-12

Lovers of the Enders series will not be disappointed, although this installment has far less of the physical battles and intrigue that mark Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. I read it in one day. The ending is a bit disappointing, but that's partly because Card is setting up several additional sequels (can we spell m-o-o-l-a-h?) Also, while some people say Card added to Peter's depth here, I disagree. I wanted a lot more of Peter in the book, since he is the Hegemon, and because he's probably the second most interesting character that Card has ever created. Unfortunately, in this book, Card backs away from the sadism that we all know from previous books which lurks under the surface for Peter. Peter goes from a fascinating enigma to just a supersmart superdriven Geek who wants to rule the world.<br />However, the growth of Bean is what this book is all about, in more ways than one. Bean starts to develop a personality beyond being an ultrabrilliant young Napoleon.<br />Card also uses too many contrivances to move the plot along and to construct additional sequels...In some ways I liked it better when he spent years between these books and came out with something completely different.<br />Also felt Card vastly oversimplified and stereotyped various countries, but perhaps it was the only way to write this story.<br />I also never quite got why Achilles was so successful. Achilles' great plans seem so implausible, and yet they occur. Card says it is Achilles incredible, weird force of personality. Maybe, but I wasn't convinced the way I was about Ender's force of personality.<br />(And maybe, just maybe people in India would read the reports that Achilles is a psychopathic killer and not turn their country over to him? D'ya think?)<br />Okay, so it's a flawed book. I still loved every minute of it. Keep pumping them out, Card, and I'll keep buying.	2001-01-10
