The five steps in order are:<br /><br />1. Build Trust. Team members should be comfortable enough with each other to expose their vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Optimal solutions often emerge from a deeper undertanding of the overlap among the areas of weaknesses of different team members.<br /><br />2. Uncover, discuss, and resolve conflicts. This leads to healthier and more meaningful relationships over the long run.<br /><br />3. Inspire commitment to an overarching goal after the pros and cons have been frankly discussed. Often times, egos of the team members result in their pulling in different directions.<br /><br />4. Set up the right metrics and processes to ensure accountability.<br /><br />5. Pay close attention to results via regular follow up and coaching.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this four stars is that I haven't applied all this yet to a real world situtation to significantly improve team productivity and so don't know for sure that this works. Applying this takes time...	2005-10-12

There is quite a bit of overlap in content with Trout's earlier books.<br /><br />The questions (and summarized answers) are:<br /><br />1. What is the essence of marketing?<br /><br />Explaining simply why a product is different and why it should be bought instead of other competing products.<br /><br />2. What's branding all about?<br /><br />Establishing the product name and its differentiating idea in the mind of the prospective customer.<br /><br />3. What should be my product strategy?<br /><br />Be either #1 or #2 in a category; otherwise create a new category,<br /><br />4. How do I get my pricing right?<br /><br />Competitive price + delta for perceived differentiated value<br /><br />5. Are there limits to growth?<br /><br />Yes, do not stray from core competence and the differentiated idea established in cstomers' mind. Set realistic growth goals.<br /><br />6. What is good research?<br /><br />Avoid research / survey reports because what people say and what they do is often different. Useful to ask customers to rate competitors along various differentiated vectors on a range of 1-10. This tells which company owns which product feature.<br /><br />7. How do I evaluate advertising?<br /><br />Does the ad effectively communicate the differentiating idea to encourage a customer to buy?<br /><br />8. How do I pick the right medium?<br /><br />Words are more effective than pictures; spoken is more effective than printed.<br /><br />9. How important are logos?<br /><br />The brand's power lies in the name, not the symbol / visual.<br /><br />10. What mistakes are made most often?<br /><br />Underestimating competition<br /><br />It's not about a better product, it's about a better perception<br /><br />Ignoring reality, wishful thinking<br /><br />Losing focus, brand extension<br /><br />You will cut thru the marketing BS, and paradoxically, have a deeper appreciation for marketing.	2005-06-30

Accurate perception of reality<br /><br />2. Developing an attitude to objectively evaluate alternatives and creative out-of-the-box thinking in the face of difficult situations.<br /><br />3. Keeping problems in relative perspective, e.g., comparing day-to-day problems with true catastrophes such as death of near-ones, life-long disability / disease enables one to not panic unduly from more \\"normal\\" problems<br /><br />4. Live in the present - identify what you enjoy doing and are naturally good at. Then, continuously seek opportunities that enable you to spend more time on these activities.<br /><br />5. Morality - Every action has a consequence although the final result may be delayed. Taking short-cuts eventually come back to bite you and damage you in a variety of ways.<br /><br />6. Numerous ways to improve human relations including brevity, compassion, assertiveness, discretion, closure, genuineness, refined behavior, responsibility & commitment, tolerance, and win-win.<br /><br />7. Simplicity - evaluate your time / frustration costs and let more grievances slide,<br /><br />8. Discontinue reltionships with folks that drain you<br /><br />9. Self-discipline<br /><br />10. Action / persistence<br /><br />The habits are easy to understand and are intuitive. Reading the book will help you identify and act on several improvements.	2005-05-21

There were a few ideas that are worth chewing on. For example, per Trout, success is often riding the right horse. Both hard work and intelligence are long shots, finding fast-growing successful companies is a long-shot; finding a successful product is a medium shot; finding a person with successful career trajectory and hitching your career to theirs is a more reliable way of duplicating success. Others such as avoiding all recent advances in technology may be a little simple-minded and perhaps, unnecessary in the end.	2004-12-28

The authors describe that the more effective approach is for an executive to be on the front line working with the customers. This is because a strategy developed in relative isolation from customers is unlikely to leverage off of the company's positioning in the customer's mind. The executive's objective would be to identify the competitive mental angle or the position / niche his company holds in the customers mind. This leads to identifying a simple differentiating tactic. Examples include pizza delivery time (Domino's) or \\"we're #2; we try harder\\" (Avis). This approach becomes highly effective when the executive uses the simple winning tactic as a lightning rod to gather and focus the entire company's energy. This involves continuous improvements in processes, products, positioning towards the singular goal of penetrating deep into customer's mind via the beachhead that was initially identified. Contrary to most models, a strategy is developed from a winning tactic by seeking broad input from customers and a variety of stakeholders; however, execution, planning, and marketing are carefully controlled and coordinated in a precise military fashion to surgically deepen the penetration in a customer's mind. The emphasis is on fixing things within the organization to match the meaning already present in a customer's mind rather than spend a lot of resources ineffectively to change a customer's mind.	2004-11-02

The principles are easy to understand and are intuitive. Due to the complexities of modern life, we have built &quot;short-cut&quot; reactions to these influences. Most of the time, these short-cuts are fine; however, folks can sometimes create events that &quot;trigger&quot; your short-cuts and may be able to unduely influence you. Robert discusses the theory of these principles, practical situations where these principles are often unscruplously applied, mechanisms to better become aware of these influences, and ways to counter them. You will gain better insights into your past behavior when you fell for sucker deals. Hopefully, reading this book will help you avoid / reduce future bad deals.	2000-09-29

So, I  got the book for a quick skim and to fill &quot;gaps&quot;. The first few  chapters didn't add much value. However, the last 2/3 of the book outlined  a fairly simple and straight-forward decision making process. I have found  this process useful to &quot;pause&quot; when analyzing / making decisions  and become more aware of which implications can be directly deduced, which  ones are hypothesis (thru intuition), and how to verify / refute the  latter. I applied the process formally to making a decision to renew third  party software license in our organization.
