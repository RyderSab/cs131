This is another book on the never ending topic of retirement. As many others it claims to have the formula that will allow you to retire with more money than you thought possible. It advocates invest all your retirement portfolio on index funds that track the market. Without judging if this is right or wrong; you should use caution as with any other \\"magical\\" investment mix and do what's best for you.  <br /> <br />Mazonas tells us that by investing in those funds the savings on commissions and fees together with the miracle of compounding interest we will be able to beat 80% of the investments vehicles out there. Well, I have two problems with that; First if you are invested in securities that consistently appreciate 10% or 15% a year (and they do exist) and that pay dividends you are still better off than with index funds. Second, many 401k out there do not offer index funds, or if they do you may have only one option. And I hope you know better than to put all your money in just one basket. <br /> <br />So take it for what it is, another book with sound advice, but remember is not the Bible. <br /> <br />One annoying point is that we are continuously being directed to the author's website. RetireYes! to make use of the tools offered there. Well, there is no tools or forms or anything of the sort there, apparently it is a work in progress and it's not completed.         <br />	2005-09-01

I may be one of the few people on the planet that was bored to tears with the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" trilogy. Having said that I can recognize its originality, it is the blueprint of fantasy. Everybody borrows or copies elements from these books; Harry Potter, anyone. <br /> <br />But Brooks just blatantly copies LOTR, people, places, plot are just carbon copies of Tolkien's books. And he has written about twenty on the series! I can't believe Tolkien's family is not suing this guy for all the money he has earned with this rip-off. <br /> <br />If there is really another life I hope Tolkien is waiting for Brooks to give him grief for the rest of Eternity.     <br /> <br />	2005-08-31

This is the first book of the Sharpe series, not the first one written; but the first chronologically. It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of the Tipoo Sultan, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides a more serious account of the Tipoo life and character is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note. <br /> <br />Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another... <br /> <br />And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing. <br />	2005-08-26

Darden uses one fourth of the book to raise himself up, and another fourth is full of meaningless stories. The advice on the HIT part is somehow unrealistic for most people. Training to failure can be dangerous and lead to injury, especially with beginners; and unless you are really committed you will burn out easily.  <br /> <br />The part that worries me the most is the `nutrition' part. Darden advises that in the initial two weeks of the program you should drink during the day a solution of water, creatine and a load of SUGAR! That will basically send your insulin levels thru the roof and keep them up there all day long! Insulin is poisonous to neurons, so imagine what you will be doing to your brain for two weeks! Anybody with basic nutrition knowledge will tell you that it is not the wisest thing to do. <br /> <br />He claims that the individual he used to test the program was able to gain two pounds of muscle a day!! Well, do you really need somebody to tell you that that is IMPOSSIBLE? Even if it is that will be such a strain to your heart that again any serious professional will advise against it. <br /> <br />Summarizing, if you are really interested in HIT training this is not the advice you should be following. There are much better books out there. <br />	2005-08-16

It advocates among other things to start your own business and became the best employee. All very good and logical, but beware, some of the advice is not for everybody and may get you in trouble. Not everybody, for example, will do fine in a marketing or sales position, as a matter of fact if you don't have the right skill set it may get you fired. <br /> <br />On the good and refreshing side, this one preaches and encourages hard work and dedication, it is no a get rich fast scheme,  <br /> <br />After finishing the book you realize that you probably knew most of what it discussed.

He publishes three or four books a year, mostly written by somebody else. His style (or the style of the people that writes for him) is very simple, maybe seventh grade. Chapters are very short, and that can be annoying or make the story move really fast. One has come to expect countless twists and cliffhangers in the story, and again that can be exciting or exhausting. <br /> <br />This book is no exception. The plots move at the speed of light, characterization is poor, we move from one murder to the next and when we are overloaded and we don't care anymore explanations and the real killer are revealed. <br /> <br />This is a carbon copy of his other books.

Interesting deep sea adventure with the good old Russians causing havoc and threatening to desestabilize the world's order. Yeah, like we have not read anything like it before! What made it special then it was that it was a new author's first effort. This was Clancy's debut novel. And it looked so promising! It was a little heavy on descriptions and on incredible long background stories of some of the characters and that made the overall pace suffer.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately I feel that Clancy's later efforts are still trying to repeat this book's success, without even getting close. He has even resorted to \\"Ghost writing\\" with series as horrid as \\"Net Force\\".  <br /> <br />If you must read Clancy, \\"Hunt\\" is your best bet. <br /> <br />	2005-07-18

On later years Koontz seems to be under contract to produce two books a year. Even though still good reads, this is not the Koontz I knew and that had me up all night. We can only hope he returns to form. In the meantime; you might want to revisit, or read for the first time great books like  \\"Watchers\\", \\"Whispers\\" or the excellent \\"Estrangers\\".  <br />	2005-06-07

This book has been widely discussed and read, regarded as classic and worth of a Nobel Prize for William Golding. For some reason I had my reserves about it, I do with most \\"classics\\", but I decided to read it anyway. Even though is haunting and beautifully written; I was left with the feeling that this was just a novel of kids stranded on a desert island that could have been much better. And most of the critic to human nature and society is just a lot of hype.	2005-06-06

I'm interested on sea adventures, and his books looked promising. I finally picked up Goliath. That wasn't a very good move. This was incredibly boring, to my credit I have to say that I finished the book, but it took a lot of effort. I can't believe people are comparing this to Clancy!. Two starts, just because maybe I picked up the wrong book by this author.	2005-06-02

Good for a comic book or one of those senseless summer blockbuster action movies. But for a book this was pretty bad. If you want action and adventure try James Rollins, he writes along the same lines, but much better, mind you.	2005-06-02

With \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" Dan Brown has achieved the dream of all writers, he has achieved tremendous success and immortality. It won't matter if his next book is a dud, it will make number one in the New York Times. The struggle is over.<br /><br />As for why the book if so popular when there is nothing original about it or actually disclose anything we have not heard, read or seen in movies thousands of times?. I think I know the answer, CONTROVERSY; let's be real, this was not a cultural phenomenon in the world till it became famous in America. And the only reason it did is because Americans love controversy, they thrive on it!.<br /><br />There are hundreds of books and movies (The last temptation of Christ, anyone?) that suggest that Mary Magdalene and you know who were having fun. But nobody ripped their clothes in outrage till now? Why? I know the answer again OPORTUNISM; this is the time to be noted and raise hell.<br /><br />Anyway, all that probably will pass soon, if you must read DVC go ahead, it's actually a pretty fast and entertaining read, but do not allow it to change your perception of reality, you know better than that!

It's Follet's Game	I became a Follet fan after reading \\"Eye Of The Needle\\" when I was a teenager, arguably one of the best WWII thrillers ever. I have read almost everything Ken Follet has written since, and I  concur his World War stories are the best. This is no exception, you can tell the author is having a blast while writing it. You will enjoy reading it too!.	2005-05-25

Action, adventure, romance, exotic locations. This book has it all.  <br />After reading several other Smith books you realized most of them have similar structure; roaring action at the beginning and at the end with a somehow sallow middle part. But still highly enjoyable. <br />   <br />	2005-05-25

This is the book that put Ken Follet on the map. Several other novels mimic if not blatantly copy the stile, structure and story of this book, none of them surpass it thought. You can't go wrong with this one!  <br />	2005-05-25

OK, maybe he took a vacation on this one, kind of  predictable and formulaic story. If you are a hardcore fan, by all means read it. If you are new to Follet try \\"Eye of the needle\\" or \\"The key to Rebecca\\" first.	2005-05-25

It takes you back in time and allows you to get a first hand feeling of life in Europe in the 1940s during war times. Someone mentioned this book is a clone of Ken Follet's \\"Eye of the Needle\\"; maybe so, but it stands on its own.  <br /> <br />If you like World War II espionage thrillers pick up this one and enjoy the ride!    <br />	2005-05-25

THIS IS JUST FICTION!. <br />After making that clear, apparently it was necesary judging some of the previous reviews, KUDOS to EG for another great read, for pushing her limits, for taking chances and being willing to deal with the consecuences and for taking her characters closer to real LIFE. Yes, in real life things also happen that don't make sense ALL THE TIME. <br />And to the other reviewers, you are entitled to your opinion, you can like or dislike this book, but PLEASE stop revealing the ending!!!	2005-04-14
