Although the word hadn't yet entered everyday language when William James published Pragmatism in 1907, the philosopher believed its doctrine had virtually become common sense in twentieth-century America.  For James, pragmatism was a specific philosophical alternative to essentialism and foundationalism and argued that ideas are meaningful only insofar as they have practical consequences in concrete human experience; however today pragmatism has come to denote merely a general willingness to compromise principles, even to the point of selfishness or irresponsibility.  Written in an engaging and accessible style, Pragmatism is a valuable corrective to modern uses of the word, since the voice that speaks in its pages embodies precisely the opposite values from the pejorative senses the word has acquired.\\"	2005-10-12

It is difficult now to appreciate both how audacious an undertaking it represents, and how astonishing its immediate and continued success was.  Over the course of twelve books Milton wrote an epic poem that would ''justify the ways of God to men,'' a mission that required a complex drama whose source is both historical and deeply personal.  The struggle for ascendancy between God and Satan is played out across hell, heaven, and earth but the consequences of the Fall are all too humanly tragic--pride, ambition, and aspiration the motivating forces.'  In this new edition derived from their Oxford Authors text, Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg discuss the complexity of Milton's poem in a new introduction, and on-page notes explain its language and allusions.\\"	2005-10-12

We will always be happy, he argued, if we learn to desire that things should be exactly as they are.  After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination.  His pupil Arrianus later collected and published the master's lecture notes; the Enchiridion, or Manual, is a distillation of Epictetus' teachings and an instructional manual for a tranquil life.  Full of practical advice, this work offers guidelines for those seeking contentment as well as for those who have already made some progress in that direction.

The author indicates there are economic, philosophical and behavioral aspects to be resolved, but that a willingness to address the problem is the prime requisite. E xamples are used to illustrate specific points throughout the book pertaining to racism, discrimination, integration, the importance of family on education, affirmative action, black crime, black anti-Semitism, black leaders in the black movement and the role of government.  Because the problems can be considered from many different perspectives, in reviewing the country's black problem, the author has attempted to include the opinions, the biases and prejudices and the proposed solutions of both blacks and nonblacks, academics, reporters, writers and politicians.  Insofar as the problem that blacks experience is creating a greater mental health problem than most people realize (it has been called by some the number one mental health problem in America today), the book offers invaluable insight in the need for a better understanding of the current situation.

However, it also enriched traditional disciplines in profound and significant ways.  Proponents of Black and Ethnic Studies confronted the false notion that scholarly investigations were objective and unbiased explorations of the range of human knowledge, history, creativity, artistry, and scientific discovery.  As they protested against hegemonic notions like 'universal' psychology and re-evaluated canonical texts in literature, a new model of academic inquiry evolved: one committed to serving a range of populations, that critiqued traditional politics, culture, and social affairs, and worked with activist energy for the transformation of the existing social order.\\"<br /><br />SYNOPSIS<br /><br />\\"In 32 articles, leading scholars examine what the editors call the 'socially engaged field' of Black studies.

In the 1950s, before the recent burgeoning of the black middle class, Frazier identified the problems that occur in the aftermath of 'black-flight' from the inner cities and black communities of the rural South.  The book's relevance has only increased as over the years the divide between increasingly prosperous middle-class blacks and their increasingly desperate 'underclass' brethren has grown into an almost uncrossable chasm.  Â¶ By tracing the evolution of the black bourgeoisie, from the segregated South to the integrated North, Frazier shows how the blacks who comprised the middle class have lost their cohesion by moving out of black communities and attempting to integrate white communities.  The result of this integration 'is an anomalous bourgeois class with no identity, built on self-sustaining myths of black business and society, silently undermined by a collective, debilitating inferiority complex.'  Frazier hoped to dispel the image of blacks as having thrown off the psychological and economical ravages of slavery to become economically powerful, because according to Frazier, it was a lie that was damaging the community.  Â¶ Frazier, chairman of the Department of Sociology at Howard University and president of the International Society for the Scientific Study of Race Relations, hoped that Black Bourgeoisie would impel blacks to make changes that would empower their community.  For the most part, those hoped-for changes have not occurred.  Nevertheless, today, as many black people are calling into question the very existence and relevance of an autonomous 'black community,' his book offers a fascinating perspective on the costs of that community's dissolution.\\"--Sacred Fire	2005-10-05

Using the first-hand accounts of victims Dorais shows that certain reactions are specific to male victims of abuse as they attempt to preserve a sense of physical integrity and masculinity.

Yet while generating a sense of community and common purpose, the Million Man March, with its deliberate exclusion of women and implicit rejection of black gay men, also highlighted one of the central faultlines in African American politics: the role of gender and sexuality in antiracist agenda.<br /><br />\\"In this groundbreaking anthology, a companion to the highly successful Critical Race Feminism, Devon Carbado changes the terms of the debate over racism, gender, and sexuality in black America. The essays cover such topics as the legal construction of black male identity, domestic abuse in the black community, the enduring power of black machismo, the politics of black male/white female relationships, racial essentialism, the role of black men in black women's quest for racial equality, and the heterosexist nature of black political engagement.<br /><br />\\"Featuring work by Cornel West, Huey Newton, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., A.

Despite the good intentions of its creation, he contends, this rigid model is used too often as justification for the oppression and mistreatment of black women and children. Neal urges us to imagine instead a ''New Black Man'' - a revolutionary model of black masculinity for the twenty-first century that moves beyond patriarchy to promote family, community, and diversity.' Part memoir, part manifesto, this book celebrates the black man of our times in all his vibrancy and virility. It is a tribute to a new face on the horizon of black America that is not to be missed.\\"<br /><br />FROM THE CRITICS<br /><br />Library Journal<br /><br />\\"Who or what is the 'New Black Man'? Neal (black popular culture, Duke Univ.; Songs in the Key of Black Life) argues that, to survive, contemporary black men must disassociate themselves from the figure of the 'Strong Black Man' as designed by W.E.B. Du Bois and Frederick Douglass and instead embrace that of the New Black Man, whose strength resides in community, family, and diversity. This new model derides sexism and homophobia, which Neal argues have sprung inadvertently from the models of the past. Far from being a dull polemic, Neal's new work is sharp, provocative, and often laugh-out-loud funny in the manner of Michael Eric Dyson and Ishmael Reed (caveat: Neal's language can be rough). Taken in conjunction with Phillip Brian Harper's Are We Not Men?: Masculine Anxiety and the Problems of African-American Identity, this book is a clarion call that should be read by the entire African American community.

This ritualized expression of masculinity, involving behaviour, speech, and physical and emotional posturing, suggests distance, irony, and superiority over outsiders, and delivers to others a clear message of strength and control. Unfortunately, this strategic style has created a chasm between black males who adopt it, and women and other men in their communities.

He habitually adopted the guise of a fool in public, which made it all the harder to grasp what he was getting at with his pop paintings and deadpan films. By making his own apparent lack of competence and intelligence into an elaborate ruse, he became a figure without precedent: a man whose self-conscious naivete has had revolutionary impact. With poise, wit, and exacting intelligence, Kelly M. Cresap accomplishes a nearly impossible task: accounting for the far-ranging implications of Warhol's sustained performance as a naif. Warhol's practice of 'cultivating naivete,' as Cresap formulates it, provides a compelling new avenue for examining the enigma of his personality as well as the extraordinary scope of his influence. It sheds light on Warhol's queer sexuality, his artistic, literary, and social passions, and his uncanny aura. This book is as much for those who despise Warhol as those who admire him. Among the offerings here are a vigorous account of the search for Warhol's brain; a polemic on camp taste; and a unique form representing four decades of intense debate about the artist. Readers will find an engaging blend of art and literature, popular culture and mythology, as well as timely reflections on post-modernism, queer sensibility, and the nature of jokes and performance.\\"--courtesy of Barnes & Noble	2005-09-22

Ron, also known as (aka) \\"Outlaw,\\" for example, is on pp. (pages) 12-13 in b&w and in color on pp. 65-67 & 100-101.  There is no text after the Introduction and no captions identifying the models.  In case you are wondering if any of your favorite models are included, I also recognized Angelo, Barry, Clayton or \\"Clay,\\" Francoise, Mack, Mario Albert, Mark, Mickey (cover), 'Rone, \\"Sputnik,\\" \\"Taurus,\\" Ty aka Jack, Vic and Warren.  A lot of others are shown, but I do not know their names.  Many of the photo's have been circulating for years on the Internet, which is where I associated their names/aliases, but the 'net pictures have usually been degraded as cropped, thumbnailed, low resolution, etc.  I was glad to see the picture of Clay(ton) in the book, although in black & white, because the color image that has circulated on the 'net is stretched sideways and the book's image is the first time that I have seen the picture without distortion.  On the other hand, some of the photo's I have never seen before; to me, I think the book would still be worthwhile even if I had seen all the photo's before.  Overall, the photo's are usually not cropped, often showing too much background, but better too much than not enough.  The emphasis is on full, frontal nudity.  Some rear views are shown, but are usually given lesser importance as one of two or more photo's on a page, instead of a full page.  Likewise, there are only a few portraits without full nudity, front or rear; I did not add any portraits as Customer Images (being suitable without nudity) because they are not as representative of the book's content as much as the cover.

The title is much too broad; a more accurate title would be, \\"Fashion Styles of Some Rich & Famous Black Males.\\"  As for bodies, they are mostly clothes hangers here; the amount of skin on the cover is misleading.  The contents rate as PG because of a couple behinds and a few covered crotches; there is no full, frontal nudity whatsoever.  I don't know how anybody gets any soul out of this book, unless they see it in the eyes of some portraits or glean it from scattered quotes of fashion magazine staffers, usually a phrase or single sentence each, as the quotes, along with some other one-sentence observations by the author, are the only text.  Therefore, the cover and title are cheap,  bookselling tricks, but the book price is not cheap.  A used copy, however, IS cheap, as buyers turn into sellers.  Although a book about men of color, I am surprised that black & white plates out-number color 3:1, as I count about 90 b&w and 31 color photo's.  I am a fan, too, of some of the people featured, but, to me, this is no reason to gush about the book as a whole.  Although I could ooh and ah about some of the photo's, there are a like number of dogs and mediocre shots.  What could form a pop-culture chapter itself is the number of celebrities who must have paid a lot for elaborate fantasy scenes shot by highly-paid photographers.  I would not feel good about seeing this sort of arrogance if I shelled out a lot for their books, CD's, magazines, ticket prices, etc., the profits of which finance such folly.  The author sees Black male fashion from a mainly GQ-type perspective, which may be right in-step in certain parts of Manhattan, but, from here in 'da hood, its seems like he's in an ivory tower.  He has a new book coming out, with a similar cover and title, of which I will be suspicious.  Except for a few unkwnowns, I expect that everyone involved is highly paid--subjects, photographers, fashion industry, etc.--and I wonder if people paid to be in this book, either in the form of their likeness(es) or their work; it would explain a lot.r if people paid to be in this book, either in the form of their likeness(es) or their work; it would explain a lot.	2005-08-14

Photographers whose work appears as part of this important collection include Horst P. Horst, Nan Goldin, Greg Gorman, Doris Kloster, Rob Lang, Mark Morrisroe, Richard Phibbs, Pierre et Gilles, Herb Ritts, Wolfgang Tillmans, Andy Warhol, Trevor Watson.\\"  Among the name-dropping, I liked only certain selections by et Gilles and Phibbs.  Among 223 pages, 49 photographers are covered at a few pages each.  The content begins on page 20, so there are 204 plates; however, only about 25 feature frontal nudity.  I purposely do not say FULL frontal nudity because, of the 25, about 15, or 3/5, are what I would call torso shots (faceless or face not discernible).  Overall, too many behinds are featured and too few fronts, as the author seems to have mainly selected works in which the subjects are twisted every which way to hide or obscure their private parts.  Having seen other and, in my opinion, better works by some of the photographers, I must conclude that the author prefers back rather than front views and prefers mystery in frontals.  For example, the few by Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden are more like the worst rather than \\"stunning\\" or \\"important.\\"  Too bad, as von Gloeden, I think, came closest to the Adonis ideal, using classical Greek or Greco-Roman settings (Taormina: Wilhelm Von Gloeden, for example) and romanesque, Italian models.  Letting the buyer beware, this fits a general trend that some women (I presume that the author is female) may be overly concerned with buns.  Although I just received the book, I am going to sell my copy.	2005-08-06

Sculptors, painters, architects, and artisans heavily influenced by Michelangelo were eagerly sponsored by the Medici dynasty to build and decorate their palaces. As indicated in Adrian Randolph's Engaging Symbols, the Medici and other prominent Florentine families used art to influence popular and religious perception and opinions. This book, however, takes it one step further. Twelve scholarly essays show how the Medici were able to establish supremacy over not only the arts but the humanities, sciences, and theatrical spectacles important to the life of the city. The catalog contains 225 full-color plates, with detailed information on each item in the show, presenting a rare opportunity to see a vast array of late Renaissance and early Mannerist objects, from paintings and sculpture to tapestries, ceramics, and pietre dure (semiprecious stone inlay). While lacking an index, the work is fully footnoted and contains an extensive bibliography.

It is Sinclair Lewis' nineteenth novel (some of which have bled very little), and it is one of his best.  Also, in spite of being his nineteenth, it is technically advanced, and fresh in its subject matter, wise, and sincere.  The old master has learned how to use words with the minimum of wastage.  Gone now are the descriptive catalogues of the paraphernalia of American life, which, after the first years, grew as tiresome as Whitman's lists of occupations.  Dropped now (and sometimes we miss them) are the incredibly realistic conversations, rambling on for the sake of sarcasm.  So sure is the hold on the theme that the author can insert incisive narratives (a lifetime in two pages) of marital relationships which never enter into the story, but are like the symbolic paintings on the walls of palaces where Chaucer stages his stories.  Yet these brief narratives are not symbolic but bitterly real, and supply without changing the focus of the novel many other tragedies and comedies of marriage being acted in Grand Republic, Minnesota, where Judge Timberlane and his Jinny played theirs with the egotism of self-centered experience.  Â¶ You will find in Cass Timberlane [italics] most of Sinclair Lewis' faults as an observer of life.  If you go with him, you must share experience as he sees it.  To certain aspects of any society he has always been, and is, insensitive.  Thin-skinned himself, it is the coarse, the rough, the lacquered with insincerity that set his imagination sparking.  It is reconciliation with the man at home as God chose to make him, which is his only solution--but a reconciliation not in principle but by bitter-won personal experience.  No one can doubt that his America is in three dimensions, and each angle a deep one, but it is often a shocking America, healthily shocking to those who draw their judgments more from the New Testament and less from the Old than does Lewis.  Â¶ But you will find also a double charge of Lewis' outstanding virtues in Cass Timberlane [italics].  He is a fierce and fearless writer, who has not been afraid to make this novel of marriage an unsparing search into the sexual where it is relevant, thus writing one of the frankest books of our generation, yet without a trace of the sickly pornography of some modern realistic fiction.  And he is a humorous writer, whose humor makes up for its lack of amiability by a brilliant wit for which, so it seems to me, Lewis has never had enough praise.  And he is a tender writer, when the scene deserves it, which makes him deeply moving at climactic moments, because he holds tight to his sympathies until his characters have as much as they can bear.  Finally, like all novelists of the first rank, he never forgets, at least in this book, that his first job is to tell a story.  Â¶ So much about the novel in general.  The theme of the story itself is as old as the hills (like most stories).  It is the tale of middle-aged Judge Timberlane, stiff, very human, incorruptible, with a zest for life, and of his love at first sight for Jinny, the light-footed girl, with black hair, and a sprightly eye, and a quick intelligence.  But it is still more a story of the adjustment of experience to inexperience.  For the judge has had one marriage, with a selfish waster, and his heart is full of romantic ideals suppressed by a disillusioning experience.  And his girl, Jinny, is like a child asked to go on a diet before she has tasted the foods on a normal table.  This oversimplifies, but it is the center of the story.  The older man puts everything he has into his marriage, and his unswerving and uncritical love for his wife makes her (which is not usually true of Lewis' women) as charming and as companionable and as desirable as he thinks.  But he is daily, hourly afraid that he cannot give enough, that there are experiences he is making impossible for her.  He is afraid of her, and he is right.  It is a 'heel,' a professional seducer of women needing relief from their husbands--and Cass' best friend--who is the serpent in this near-tragedy.  He is a man who could feel like a woman, give her what she really wanted which was a chance to give all herself, not to be protected, or too much loved.  And it was not until the selfish Jinny (as a man would write) had given to the wrong man that he became wrong for her, and she could come back to an equality of love.  Â¶ In spite of Jinny's charm and the likable qualities of two other women (and one female cat) in this narrative, Cass Timberlane [italics] is one of the most devastating attacks on women in American society that I have ever read.  The men range all the way from scabrous immortality to vulgar coarseness, pitiable weakness, or sins and virtues so dull and commonplace as to take them out of sympathy.  But the women--drunkards, lecherous, avaricious, unscrupulous parasites upon their men whom they ruin, spiritual murderers, loud vulgarians--if they were not so specialized they would be terrifying.  And indeed, the verdict of this book and the knife of its satire, is that American men, excepting the 'wolves,' the scoundrels, the 'heels,' and the perverted, are afraid of their wives, and that is the chief trouble with what we call typical American society.  Nevertheless, if often horrifying and sometimes painful, and certainly not always fair, this is not a cynical story, if only because Cass and Jinny, for whom after all it was written, are rare human beings that any discriminating person would wish to have as friends.--Henry Seidel Canby\\"id that he cannot give enough, that there are experiences he is making impossible for her.

His transgression is doubly insolent in that it presents the male body nude and undefended and thus deprived of its social arrogrance and at the same time explores that homoerotic territory in which, since the beginning of time, adolescent boys have discovered sex.  Such themes are enough to intimidate the most revolutionary of photographers.  Indeed (apart from the work of Dino Pedriali) this is the first Italian photograph album inspired entirely by the male nude since the times of the German baron.\\"<br />-- from the preface by Ivan Teobaldelli	2004-03-28
