At first, this history of aviation was a (serie) of TV reports. A very good one, those kind of series you met once each 5 ou ten years ! Then came the book, it really reproduce on paper the quality and the passion of documents, events, interviews of the serie, which is very rare. Of course, it's not hardly technical, but on the other hand it will be interesting even young people.<br />I think the book is out of print forever, but if you meet it, get it !	2003-01-12

Herb sutter's first book worth it's name : it was exceptional. That's why it was a challenge to write an equally good one as a second book. Of course, Herb put a lot of it's main ideas into his first book (like the &quot;swap guts idiom&quot; for example), but it leaves a big room for side subjects.<br />Topics in this volume are well classified, maybe better than in the first volume. They adress important subjects for the C++ day to day programmer : standard library, performances, exception safety, resource management, etc... The &quot;engineering puzzles&quot; are in fact much less important than the &quot;solution&quot; described bellow. Because each of the solution is not mid game but a practicle piece of work that leads you to a better C++ quality code.<br />Honestly, this book is not for beginner. It's much more valuable to read a primer book (stroustrup's C++ programing language, or better the Lipman's C++ primer) and then Meyer's effective C++. At least. You also should have a couple of year of C++ practice behind your belt (also at least). It's a top level C++ book, with top level advices and a top level payback for you.<br />After reading this volume, I have a stong impression that next Sutter's book will stay with such level of quality. Great work, Herb, thank you !<br />A last word : Maybe you are surprised I've not given 5 stars to this book ? Well I reserve such notation for strongly exceptional book, like the &quot;design patterns&quot;. 4 stars still be very good on my own scale.	2002-02-24

Well, in fact these books are much better than \\"Design Pattern\\" rewritten in simpler words, and that's the good surprise. Now the bad news : if I compare this book to \\"Design Patterns Explained\\", well, I prefer DP explained. Honestly. This one is lighter. But with several little case studies you also can consider this book as a workshop on design patterns ! Without code in annexes, this book is only 110 pages long, which is rather short.	2002-02-24

One of my goals is to read all the books about Design Patterns. I know, it makes a very good business for some bad writters. But not here.<br />Honestly, when I began this book, I was just thinking about starting &quot;Another Book to Introduce Patterns&quot;. It is. But the first thing is : it performs the job very well. Probably because the material comes from a course given by one of the author, the very nature of the patterns is very well and clearly explained, in fact the explanation outperform the one given in the GoF !! So, without any doubt, the book is O.K. for beginners, and I will recommand it as a first book on patterns (with the GoF aside ;-).<br />The second surprise comes from unexpected thought about patterns : relationships between GoF patterns and Alexandrian patterns and about &quot;pattern process&quot;, or how a seniormost pattern leads to a new one. It's a simple, true and new idea exposed here. Last but not least, this book make the relationship between patterns and refactoring, and idea I support for more than one year.<br />Finally, the reading is very pleasant. So, why not 5 stars ? Well, I reserve this note for very rare books I found &quot;nearly perfect&quot; like the GoF itself...	2001-12-29

The experiment doesn't reflect the field realities (2 gurus working together, for an internal project !), the book is rather short and filled with uneeded source code (if I want it, I get a Java book). At the end of the book, I didn't get the impression to have learn something valuable. My advice is to prefer (for the same target) &quot;Extreme programming installed&quot; which gives a true return on experience about XP, or even &quot;Extreme Programming Explored&quot;,called &quot;the XP FAQ&quot; by myself.<br />Bob &amp; James, you are great guys. Really ! I lot of your writtings is more than valuable, and I got them. That's why I owned this book blindly. I'm afraid to say that it was my &quot;disapointment of the year&quot;. Sorry.	2001-12-29

The book is really very good. Honestly, what do you expect with such a book ? To learn valable advices, to understand them, and to have fun while reading. Such a book exists : this one ! How many time I asked to myself &quot;Yes ! What a good idea ... and so simple&quot; or &quot;Of course ! That's it&quot;. I really read it like a novel.

It saves time and make the reading very efficient. The very goal of the book is to explain how to go to iterative developpement and what may cause success or failure. Everything is well illustrated by real cases, met by the author. You don't need courage to survive to this book, because the reading is pleasant. Very good.	2000-12-08

Especially for peoples who adopt OO analysis &amp; design. The author separate strongly the data (with entity diagrams) and processing, using DFD which were left between OMT and UML. This book doesn't give me more or different value than Suzanne Robertson's book. The only exception is the 2 chapters on FPA evaluation that I found very clear and good.	2000-12-04

The high value here is : they do it ! I think the approach adopted here is at least a very good starting point and the multiple view approach looks like Kruchten's idea. Another good thing is the improvements proposed to UML for architechture. My highest regret is about examples proposed here : They are too complex and the ideas behind the approach is hidden behind the exemple themselves which are hard to understand. Moreover, we have four example, all seems to be real time example. I would like to have several domain here, like B2B architechture and classic IS architecture. Finally, it's a pitty to gives only 3 stars for a book where I feel 5 stars possible...	2000-12-04

It shows clearly how the Use Cases are completed iteratively, with clearly named completion levels. The book also tackle the problem of detailed rules attached to Uses Cases as well as risk list mitigation. On the bad side, I don't like the Use Cases decomposition the authors adopt and, even if a case study is a good idea, two case studies which spend the half of the book seems too much. Another thing about the iterative approach : to oulines the difference between 2 iterations, it should be interesting to use 2 colors or at least bold characters.	2000-12-04

Once you have this idea, this book helps you. You'll find here, essentially pieces of advices which looks like process patterns (in my opinion it should even improve the book to show these advices through a pattern form) to tackle specific problems whith requirements engineering. Moreover, these advices can be read separately. For the beginners, it mises a strong frame along the book to know what is exactly requirements management and so on. But I think the authors are right to do not try to satisfy everybody. As a weakness, I don't know why, but this book seems to be a bit old, where the edition date is only 1997, through a lot of details I feel to read a book written in the early 1980s. But this book is not about technology, so it's not a big weakness.	2000-12-04

In fact, this book is not about process, it's about how to investigate, how to interview and communicate with people to get the information. Gause &amp; Weinberg probably highlight the most important point in requirements engineering : how to manage groups ? How to get the information ? How to manage uncertainity ? Easy to read and helpfull.	2000-12-04

In truth, I now effectively work with UML on web application. In truth, I trust in the Addison Wesley's OO series, but I found to much buzzword in the title to be  honest ... But in fact, the book is good ! It's probably too light for UML  experts (I pretend to be one of them), it's also probably too light for web  experts (I'm not). But, first of all, it's very rare to be the both.  Second, the book really makes the connexion between both worlds ! And it  makes it in a smart fashion with good and effective ideas, like simple  activities and effective traceability. If you know Doug Rosenberg's book,  you will be easy with the proposed ideas. OK, it's not the book of the  decade (unlike Design Patterns, for example), but it's far from a lost of  money, and the book can be red very fast, which is also a very good point.	2000-06-23

This book is technical, for sure. But scott meyer's way of &quot;walking&quot; through the explanation makes it nearly  simple. Moreover, the style, with lot of jokes, makes it a pleasure. At the  end, we've lost the feeling to have read a technical book. Incredible! As  far as I remeber, I red the first edition several years ago, just after  learning basic C++ feature: This book helps me to understand that we must  know more than the syntax. That's why I recomand the book as a second level  book, once you have learn C++ basis and even after few month of practice.  ... Then Get it and enjoy !	2000-06-23

Really !  I pratice OO development especially following RUP. This book describe a full Usability process, with activities, guidelines, workload estimation and artifacts. You can directly  put it at work, because you naturally see why an activity leads to another.  All the book is good, even if it seems heavy (500+ pp), there is no waste  of space. As a RUP practitioner, it's very easy to integrate this approach  into the RUP and it naturally fits with Use Cases. Believe me: get it !	2000-06-23

Like very good (C++) books, hard (exceptional) C++ features are very well explained. The structure of the  book is based on few pages items. Because each item begin with a quizz-like  example, the reader is not passive, but invited to &quot;play&quot;. It  makes the learning very effective.

The Design Patterns receive more attention in my own opinion, because patterns newcomers (I was one of them, few years ago) found at first (nices)  solutions that may be applied directly. It take a little time to understand  that the great idea is elsewhere. POSA book (this one) tackle directly to  this great idea, and exposes several patterns categories (3, in fact).  Architectural patterns are really well explained, much better than in the  GoF. The POSA book receive less attention probably because authors forget  the idea to &quot;attract&quot; newcomers, at least in my mind. Anyway, the  Design Patterns is my &quot;book of the Decade&quot;. I consider this one  as the second to purchase in the patterns movement, but it's not a second  hand material, it's a complementary materials.	2000-06-23

One could say (and I am one of them) that this discipline missed model usage, because the  author prefer CRC cards. Nevertheless, the author don't pretend to get the  ultimate graal, but simply expose his ideas. I think that there are a lot  of good ideas here, especially when you deal with implementation. Moreover,  the book is efficient, short with short chapter, and even if you don't buy  the author's ideas, you will not waste your time.	2000-05-31

So, there is not a lot of stuff on effective design patterns.  Hopefully there is some (and even good ones), but it's not obvious that it  justify the book size. If you are rather new to patterns (you've just read  the &quot;Design pattern&quot; and / or &quot;Pattern oriented software  architecture&quot;), consider first the third volume.

I'm sure that all this stuff can be given in at least the half size. To stay in drawbacks, we even have no effective guidelines for the activities,  but only dry and &quot;outside&quot; description of activities. Moreover,  the organisation with deeply nested sub-sections make the reading  difficult. In the Unified Process itself, we had an interesting and  detailled picture, with a lot of activities, workers and artifacts, but in  fact it is a very classical approach (maybe it is a quality ?). But when  the authors said that the method intagrates a component approach and  patterns, it sound like a joke. I found painfull to read this book, because  it's written in an unpleasant maneer, whatever the stuff inside. I hope to  do not have to read such a dry book more than once per 5 year.	1999-12-24

I found the approach especially adapted to 6 month or less project with small team,  because the author do not drown readers under a lot of activities and  artifacts. We continuously have a &quot;you are here&quot; picture of the  overall methodology, and we are continuously directed to code production.  The best part of the book is probably the robustess analysis, which allow  to go from Use Cases to an Object model, its something you can buy anyway  if you practice Use Cases.	1999-12-23

It is really an introduction, with swallow description of  activities, but with an enought sufficient visibility on overall picture.  The unpleasant part is the continuous recall of Rational Softwares, Showing  all rational Software as pieces that perfectly fits together, which is not  true. I think that a far from free book like that should be written without  these continuous references.	1999-12-22

Even if it is based on Gause &amp; Weinberg work on &quot;exploring requirement&quot;, this book is about a very well formalized and described process for requirements. On  each step, activities and artifacts are explained and true guidelines help  you to achieve the work. Last but not least, you get two book in one: a  user guide and a reference manual. If you had to build requirements (even  with UML, like me), choose this book.	1999-12-16

From my point of view, this is the 2nd book like that in this decade (the first was Design Patterns). It  outline especially that code and design that works isn't enough. He also  describes formally things that I do (and thousands programmers) for years,  but silently. Even if expressed in Java, the book is usefull in all OO  languages. Just get it!	1999-12-08

I especially appreciate the 3 layer approach for requirements and the good  description of the Vision document. On the other hand, true and effective  guidelines are often missing for each technique used, and the book often  stay on the description level. I personnaly prefer the Robertson's  &quot;Mastering the requirements process&quot; which give a more strong  process plan and guidelines. Nevertheless, it's not a useless reading.	1999-12-03
