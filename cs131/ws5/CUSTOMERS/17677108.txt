The book is a great contribution to the history of the innovative stormtroop tactics, how they came to prominence, what kind of problems they solved and why the Germans were the first among the belligerents to find such revolutionary solutions. The focus of the book is not so much on assault battalions but on their tactics, although the various personalities are well covered. Gudmundsson presents also some examples of battles on the Western and Eastern Front (First Ypres, Cambrai, Kaiserschlacht, Riga, Caporetto etc.) in a clear and fascinating way and gives ample evidence of the good results that the German Army reaped from its new doctrine. I found most interesting the part about the nature of German delegation of authority and the culture of personal iniative cultivated among the NCOs and the junior officers. It is one of the best force multipliers ever conceived! There are no photographs in the book, only a few diagrams and also a few primitive and rather crude maps, but the text is worth the money.	2005-10-11

The photographs are very good also and well chosen and the text analyzes every aspect of the stormtroops, like uniforms, weapons, organization and battle tactics. The drawings section is a great disappointment though, because its quality is below average for the Osprey standards. Buy it if you are a student of tactics and military theory and skip it if you are a modeller.	2005-10-10

Although I was afraid that Evan Wright might have produced another patriotic moral-booster recounting his experiences of the operation Iraqi Freedom, the book was a revelation of honesty and realism. The 374 Marines of the elite First Recon Battalion who were always at the spearhead of the invasion force were not super-humans or moral fighters but well trained warriors and killers who faced brutal situations and came out alive and triumphant but with some deep mental wounds. Along the way these youngsters shot anything that moved from enemy soldiers to dogs and admitted that they caused more losses to Iraqi civilians than the Iraqi Army. Wright's descriptions of the one-sided battles that the Marines gave reminded me the pictures I shaw in TV during those days of spring 2003, when a whole battalion of Marines were pinned down by a single sniper or a machine-gun nest and waited for long hours for air strikes or Abrams tanks to take the enemy out! That definitely was not a blitzkrieg campaign! The US military admits that it fought against irregulars and suicide bombers and not against a real army. The overuse of the abundant firepower led to many civilian casualties (First Recon alone called air strikes amounting to 30.000 pounds of bombs!) and the situations some times became comical and tragic, like when the mechanised column of Marines waged a long battle against a bunch of amateurish Syrian jihadists, hidden in abush behind some trees! Wright depicts the men around him with honest and captivating words and he spares no effort to condemn the behaviour of some totally incompetent officers. Some of the most interesting parts of the book are the last chapters where Marines doubt the reason behind the campaign to Iraq and express sincere fears that this could turn into an adventure worst than Somalia. There are also some prophetic words about the future deadlock in Iraq, when the Marines come into contact with the locals, experience the cultural shock and realise thatthe war has not even started.	2005-09-28

He states that the West and USA in particular is losing the war on terror because it is not ready to discharge the self-defeating myths that have troubled US policy since the 90s. The author makes many interesting points in this very sober work: 1) US' unconditional support to Israel is not only uneven and costly but almost catastrophic regarding the damage it causes to the relations with the Arabic people. 2) Osama bin Laden is not a mad murderer, a religious maniac or someone who is manipulated by other hidden figures, but a brave, clever, able and worthy opponent who means waht he says and one who must be taken seriously in order to be defeated. 3) Islamists do not wage war against America because they hate its way of life or its democratic values but because of its policy in the Middle East, and their \\"jihad\\" is defensive in nature and limited in objectives. 4) A war such as this can not be won by lawyers and police work alone and demands the full employment of the US military panoply and the secret services. 5) War can never be waged on the cheap and the idea of having other people and armies (i.e. Pakistan) to win it for you is not only bad but disastrous. 6) America has not seen the worst islamic attacks yet and the future is not bright if it doesn't change course. The islamists show exemplary patience and they even take care to lay the theoretical and theological foundation of the just use of WMD against civilian targets! 7) The idea of \\"exporting democracy\\" to societies that do not know and do not want it can not give sound results and the Afghan adventure is destined to have a tragic end. 8) The US could not give Al Qaeda a better present than the invasion of Iraq which turned the islamic majority against the West. 9) Al Qaeda considers that the US center of gravity (according to Clausewitz's doctrines) is not its loathing toward casualties but its economy, and the future strikes against it will target to destabilize its financial balance and the economic activities worldwide. This is an excellent book that offers a glimpse at the other side of the hill and all policy-makers should read it and give it proper attention.	2005-09-13

Williamson's book is simply magnificent, the best introduction to the great array of land, sea and air aces that Germany produced during World War II. The reader who does not have any idea about the levels of heroic achievements that the Wehrmacht individuals made, will be surprised to say the least. The Germans had a different view toward medals, prefering to honor the great scores or the unique records in order to produce idols for the youth, in a similar way that modern athletes do their utmost for medals and victories. Germans also had the habit to wear their decorations all the time, even in the heat of battle! In the process they produced the most specatcular fighter, submarine and tank aces, as well as scores of daring commandos, paratroopers and brave officers.

The reader gets the impression that he walks among the great aces with triple digit scores of victories and in the primitive airfields set in the Russian steppe. The youthfull faces of countless German pilots with the Knight's Cross around their neck fill this book, as well photos of the famous Bf-109s and Fw-190s, some of them showing the interesting artwork on their rudders depicting very impressive victory scores.

The book has many fine black and white photographs and the text is easy to read but there are some serious drawbacks. Ms Amadio has obviously a limited background on World War II because albeit she gives most of the times a comprehensive synopsis of the war situation she repeats some annoying mistakes, like calling Paulus army \\"6th Panzer Army\\", or mistaking 1943 for 1942 in page 195, stating that in September 1943 the Afrikakorps was about to collapse (!), or that Hitler was about to fire General Franz Halder (!), things that happened many months before. Despite its shortcomings the book remains the best source on Rall and his wartime carreer is covered in satisfying depth as well as his post war activities.	2005-09-05

The description of each ace's actions and biographical details are short but very interesting with an emphasis on their air combat experiences. The reader takes a nice overview of the most famous aces but if he wishes to learn more he hould look to other more detailed sources.

I totally agree with Mr Summers that the US defeat in Vietnam was a matter of massive conventional attack by the NVA and that counterinsurgency was valid only until the Tet Offensive in 1968. I have the same opinion with Summers, that the first and foremost task of US forces in Vietnam should be the closing of infiltration routes and the isolation of the field of battle, and the Americans should let South Vietnamese to deal with the insurgents. This is a valuable lesson also for the current painful situation in Iraq, where the balance of power is different but at least the US does not have to face a regular army of invasion as opponent in the neigboring countries. The author makes heavy use of Clausewitz's monumental book \\"On War\\" and examines the principles of war in the light of the Vietnam experience. A small drawback is that the book focuses on the US side, with only passing reference to the North Vietnamese but overall it is a great read. Through it I came to appreciate also Dave Palmer's \\"Summons of the trumpet\\".	2005-08-29

The book is well researched and documented and presents myriads of facts regarding the deficiencies of Italian war planning and fighting. Italy was totally unprepared for entering World War II and Musolini's megalomania ruined her in the most devastating way. I really enjoyed the numerous references to the state of the Italian Armed Forces and the incredible problems that the top leadership left unsolved, only to face them with disastrous consequences later in battle. I wish only that Mr Knox had also presented the good side of the Italian war effort, taking into account the important works of some \\"revisionist\\" historians, like James Sadkovich.	2005-08-25

DiNardo overturns the myth of mechanized Wehrmacht presenting a lot of facts and statistics which prove the opposite: the German Army of World War II had never enough vehicles of any kind and due to Hitler's premature attack in Poland it couldn't reach the same level of mechanization as the British or the US Army. The Germans used hundreds of thousands of horses on all fronts and that was one of the reasons the trapped 6th Army didn't attempt to break out from Stalingrad: the Soviets had captured most of its horses and the heavy weapons couldn't move at all! This is a very interesting and thought provoking book which will change many of your perceptions regarding World War II in Europe.	2005-08-25

The first part is about his childhood and how his family background shaped his character and led him to join the dreaded Waffen SS in 1942. His combat experience in the ranks of the elite 6th SS Gebirgsdivision \\"Nord\\" is recounted in fantastic descriptions as well as the loss of friends and gallant officers. September 1944 marked the beginning of a hard adventure for Voss's division as Finland capitluated and the unit was forced to retrat across central Finland towards northern Norway. The description of the terrible battles is excellent, and one can not avoid the thought that war produces many dramas on the human level and some unexpected turns of luck. The first days of 1945 found Voss and his comrades fighting against US troops in the Vosges Mountains and the battles with this new, well supplied and brave enemy were very hard indeed. The book is one of the best about World War II on the soldier level and is highly recommended for anyone who wants to get a feeling of the brutal battle conditions of the Arctic.	2005-08-16
US	17677108	R3RFL9QVN27OMB	0971680728	407048814	Unrestricted Warfare: China's Master Plan to Destroy America	Books	4	38	42	N	N	Inside the "enemy's" mode of thinking	The book is a translation of the very interesting work published in February 1999 by two PLA colonels, namely qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui and the first thing that strikes the reader is the clear mind and the scope of reading that these officers have as a background. Following Martin van Creveld's groundbreaking work \\"The Transformation of War\\" (1991), the authors consider the 1991 Gulf War as a crucial turning point in the history of warfare and declare that war between states will be the exception rather than the norm in the future. The target of the book was obviously to warn China (and PLA particularly) that it's not prudent to prepare for a conventional fight against the US military might (regarding the Taiwan issue for example) but to seek new methods by whom \\"the inferior can defeat the superior\\". The book's subtitle \\"China's Master Plan to Destroy America\\" is not absolutely justified and the reader will not find any clue that China has any connection with the islamic extremism (although the insurgency in Iraq suits her nicely). There are indeed some points inside the book which are really chilling, such as \\"whether it be intrusions of hackers, a major explosion at the World Trade Center, or a bombing attack by bin Laden, all of these greatly exceed the frequency bandwidth understood by the American military... This is because they have never taken into consideration and have even refused to consider means that are contrary to tradition and to select measures of operation other than military means\\". The great part of the book is its emphasis on future \\"non-military warfare\\" and the warning that \\"soldiers do not have the monopoly of war\\". It is unknown whether PLA's top leadership hes endorsed these views or not but there is a troublesome condemnation of the race for superior weapons technology without paying attention to the changing principles of war. The emphasis on non-state opponents like Osam bin Laden is really amazing given that 9/11 wass more thatn two years ahead when the book came out, but currently PLA does not invest only on hackers or financial warfare (althoug this last is a strong dimension of its foreign policy) bying instead modern Su-30s, \\"Sovremeny\\" destroyers and \\"Kilo\\" submarines for use in a possible war with Taiwan and its allies.     The new kind of warfare which some people call \\"Fourth Generation War\\" or \\"Asymmetric War\\" has yet to prove its validity and despite some deaths that terrorists caused in the USA, Spain, Britain, Egypt (and more than 25.000 in Iraq) they have not achieved anything of lasting importance, thus their innovative tactics have been proved (for the time being) far less dangerous than classic conventional warfare of World War II type. I found very interesting the authors' suggestion of new principles of war (Omnidirectionality, Synchrony, Limited Objectives, Unlimited Measures, Asymmetry, Minimal Consumption, Multidimension Coordination and Adjustment and Control of the entrie process) but I don't know why they forgot to mention the old but crucial principles of \\"surprise\\", \\"security\\" and \\"unity of command\\". Overall it is an important study which seeks to find new ways to confront or negate the US military superiority but the theory has not proved decisive so far. Probably, the crucial turning point for the ascendancy of this theory will be the use of WMD at the hands of terrorist groups ot other non-state elements. As for PLA, it is rather impossible to conquer Taiwan without firing a shot. On the negative side of the book is the problematic translation of names, hence \\"Aegis cruisers\\" become \\"Zeus shield cruisers\\" and MacGregor's book \\"Brealing the Phalanx\\" becomes Maigeleige's book \\"Break the Factional Position\\". Many other names have been changed almost beyond recognition!    For the reader who does not wish to receive such a heavy dose of theory though, I would strongly recommend Peter Howarth's excellent new book \\"China's Rising Sea Power\\" instead, which is full of data and a fine operational and strategic analysis of the Chinese goals and means in Western Pacific. It is rather expensive but it worths its money!	2005-08-16

The reader will not find too many details about military operations, albeit there are some interesting points which are presented with exceptional clarity. The size of the book precludes any lengthy reference to particular battles, thus many of them are mentioned in only a few sentences or not at all (like the German campaign in the Balkans (1941), the liberation of Ukraine (1944), the battle of Berlin (1945) and the destruction of the Japanese Kwantug Army (1945)). This deficiency is balanced though by the wealth of statistics regarding production figures, human losses and economic data. Parker has also made a fine job analyzing the US-British relations on the strategic level, the reasons behind the decisions taken and the role of the USSR in the Allied camp. He is also honest about the great contribution of the Soviets to the war effort and the horrible destruction they caused to the German Army. Overall, a good introduction to World War II and a handy reference to its basic military and political dimensions.	2005-08-16

After the magnificent \\"gates of Fire\\" that made him famous worldwide among those interested in ancient history, \\"The Virtues of War\\" is an incomperable account of Alexanders the Great's campaigns, viewd from the perspective of that unbeatable Greek commander. Pressfield proves again that his depth of knowledge regarding ancient warfare is really impressive and the descriptions of battles like Chaeronia, Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela are breath-taking! He not only knows tactics well but also army organization, command structure, methods of communications in ancient times and what's more, the nature of the battle in the 4th century BC, the ground over which the battles were fought, and the many fantastic details of the personalities involved. The protraits of Craterus, Memnon, Mazaios and Porus are unforgettable and of course Alexander is ever present, fighting with and against his internal \\"demon\\" who pushes him to the edges of the then known world and make him explode in fury when someone doubts his abilities. I wish Pressfield had analyzed also the battle of Hydaspes but apparently he was afraid that this could tire his readers with military details, so he skipped this episode. The campaign of the Macedonians against the Indians is covered though with many nice descriptions. The reader will be surpised by two facts: the daring nature of Alexander coupled witn an extremely well founded professionalism and by the constant fight of the Macedonian king against his own army! A novel about Alexander's epic campaigns could not be best!	2005-08-16

Jeff Edwards has Germany selling four new AIP submarines of Type 212B class to an imaginary Middle East state, and a storm of sea action follows as the Royal Navy first and then the US Navy try to intercept those vessels along their way to delivery. The battle scenes between US destroyers and frigates and the German submarines are many and hair-raising but there are some details which sometimes put reality in the back-seat, like the extensive use of sub-SAMs to slaughter the American ASW helicopters. In the last climactic battle and after having suffered great damage, a US destroyer fights alone against land-based anti-ship missiles, enemy aircraft and a submarine, coming off triumphpant in something that resembles fictionary scenario of the Aegis constructor's brosures. The book is a great past time fo modern naval battle fans as it has some interesting tips about weapons and tactics but I would like to see a more detailed hunting procedure of the German submarines making use of deception and concealment rather to avoid detection than active defense with sub-SAMs. Surface warships often turn to minimize their radar cross-section against missiles but the enemy submarines do not do the same against active sonars! Also, the author has a fine idea putting US Navy against modern diesel-electric sumarines (instead of nuclear subs whic are so beloved in almost every other novel) but he doesn't give a hint about their \\"achilles heel\\" like shnorkeling, or their advantages in littoral warfare. I belive that Jeff Edwards (whose articles I read often in websites) should not sacrifice realism for some over-dose of action.	2005-08-16

Although I had read about air-to-air operations in the Gulf War in the excellent book \\"Gulf Airwar Debrief\\", Davies' work is far more detailed and gives many interesting tips in modern tactics, especially in the little explored field of BVR combat. The reader will be surprised to find that not all the Iraqi pilots were inept and took Sparrow shots like sitting ducks, but fought with courage and even good tactical skill in some occasions. Davies also describes the reasons behind the great disparity of kills achieved by the 1st TFW and the other USAF units and also has a chapter devoted to the 1994 incident of blue-on-blue encounter when two Blackhawk helicopters were accidentally shot down over Northern Iraq killing all 26 on board. There is also a brief account of the kills achieved by F-15s during the Operation Allied Force (1999) and a good overview of the advantages and drawbacks of the new AMRAAM missiles (not all of these shots were succesfull after all!)	2005-07-19

Operations in Iraq proved some things about the value of achieving information dominance but the insurgency that followed proved also that the nature of war has not changed and that high tech information networks are scrap against a determined and cunning enemy. Even a conventional war against a first rate power (like China) is not clear how will be decided nor is the role of information warfare clear. Experience has shown that predictions in these fields are bound to be proved wrong in almost every case because there is the human factor, political considerations and pure luck which overturn everything along the way. Thus, I would not recommend this book to any serious student of war. It's far better to spend time studying military history which contains a wealth of informative examples and simply guess about the future.	2005-07-05

The author doesn't attempt to hide his passion for flying and his descriptions of his early childhood but also the circmustances of the collision with the Chinese F-8 Finback over South China Sea are so well written that make this book a page-turner. Also interesting was the story of the 11 hard days that the US crew spent in China, under pressure to admitt guilty for the collision and make an apology. The leadership of Shane Osborn and the determination of his whole crew were exemplary. I finished the book in just two days and I'm sure that with such men and with such mentality and fighting spirit, it will be very difficult for the USA Armed Forces to be ever defeated by any foe.	2005-07-04

I have read a lot of books about Hitler and World War II but Kershaw's work stands out as a true modern masterpiece which will be the stabdard work on the subject for many years. The author has made an exemplary and exhaustive study on every available source and his analysis, prose and critical approach is really outstanding. It is the best book for anyone who wishes to study Hitler's maneuvers to the top of power and clarify the extremely perplexed web of German politics in the 1920s and 1930s. I found also very useful Kershaw's analysis of the secret German rearmament and the strokes of luck that permitted the Nazis to arm to the teeth while misleading the Allies.	2005-06-29

The most interesting parts of the book were the chapters \\"ASW Process and Operations\\", \\"Submarine Observables and Indicators\\" and \\"ASW sensors and their deployment\\" which cover about 70 pages. The rest is outdated account of the submarine balance between the US and USSR and some scenarios of nuclear exchange.

So the situations described in this book are not so recent as the Editorial Review implies and readers who want to have a taste of Foreign Legion today should have a look at the book \\"Legion of the Lost\\" by Jaime Salazar. Sloane came from divorced parents and his early years were rather adventurous as he didn't have a firm guidance towards school and studying. Thus, at age 18 he was one of the self-confident young men who believe that joining the French Foreign Legion would be a fine idea to get to know the world and visit exotic places. Sloane describes the discipline (and occasional brutality) of the Legion training and the demanding physical exersices which tested his strength to the limits. He was a natural survivor though, and he asked for a posting in the famous 2nd REP, the elite regiment of Legion paratroopers. He served in Djibuti (13 DBLE) for more than two years and although he got some long leaves he didn't ever attempt to desert. He didn't experience real combat but the things he lived while serving in the Legion and especially in Africa were enough to make him hard as nails. He suffered long marches while loaded with heavy gear, he had to endure the harsh behavior of French NCOs and he was asked to crowl with his hands in pockets, to eat raw fish and slaughter animals single handedly in order to \\"taste blood\\". Even his short term as a medic in a hospital in Djibuti was a nightmare of bloody reality. He even adopted a racist behavior toward black people: \\"Morals was something we lost on the way over. We thought that life and law were not taken seriously in these places and had assumed the same attitude\\". So when he was transfered back in France, \\"I looked at the people dancing and felt alienated from them. It was going to be a long time before I would be able to tolerate society again. Iconsidered the men who were not military worthless and the women had only one purpose. Unless a man was a soldier then as far as I was concerned he was not a man... The indoctrination of the past four years had worked, and I was now a [...]. I thought the world should be ruled by the military. The military was all there was. Like a sponge I soaked it up\\".     Sloane also witnessed the collapse of the communist Eastern Bloc and the hundreds of Hungarians, Poles, Romanians and Czechs who swamped the Legion gates. He spent his hard earned money and the short leaves drinking heavily, getting into fist fights in bars and paying for the services of various prostitutes whom he detested. He fulfilled his five-year contract and returned to civilian life, but he admits that \\"for a couple of years I would sleep with my fists clenched and wake up if anybody walked into the room, jumping up in the en-garde position ready to fight the intruder\\". He adopted though an attitude that helped him come in terms with the brutal experience of the Legion: \\"Although ashamed of some of these incidents I don't regret them either - each one is a thread in the tapestry of my life. I am forever proud to have served with the Legion and become a legionnaire. It gave me a veritable understanding of trust and respect, which will stay with me for the rest of my life\\". Overall, it is a very honest book wich pictures the French Foreign Legion in all its real bright and dark aspects.	2005-06-27

Thus, Hitler found a firm base when he came into power in 1933 and he simply expanded the course that other members of Reichswehr had taken previously. The book is full of photographs and the narrative is excellent and easy to read. I especially enjoyed the chapter about the Krupp family, the personalities that made this firm an industrial colossus and its role in the secret rearmament project.	2005-06-27

Deist focuses more on the political side of the rearmament and the relations between the Reichswehr leaders and the German goverment but he gives only few numbers and statistics. Much of the book is devoted to the personnel increase and the ways that officer corps was multiplied but no details are given regarding actual weapons manufacturing and production statistics. The book contains chapters that deal with the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine but the same weak points apply to them also. For someone interested in the German rearmament I would recommend instead the very good book \\"Fists of Steel\\" published by Time Life Books, or Peter Batty's \\"The House of Krupp\\", or even John Gooch and Amos Perlmutter's \\"Military Deception and Strategic Surprise\\" which contains a chapter on the subject with an emphasis on the deception measures taken by the Germans.	2005-06-24

Mark Joseph paints his characters with vivid colors and his dialogues are really enjoying but except for a few tips in submarine tactics, he didn't impress me so much. The use of passive and active sonars (\\"echo ranging\\" is the term used for the latter) was rather generally explained and the role of hiding behind or above thermal layers was not explored in depth. I think this book ranks lower than Patrick Robinson's \\"Nimitz Class\\" in terms of pure action, but it earns the fourth star for its very realistic finale.	2005-06-22

I was very impressed by this scene and some days later I read that USAF strikes were responsible for that carnage. Although that news was an anticlimax as I had initially supposed that the US tanks had done the damage, I accepted that and felt impressed by the accuracy of modern aerial bombs and missiles. The enigma was revealed finally when I read Jason Conroy's excellent book \\"Heavy Metal\\" where I found out that a sole armored company of the 2nd BCT (3rd ID) did all that execution in Baghdad's streets, in an area called Mahmudiyah, within very few minutes and in a fight which resembled a gunfight in a telephone booth. The author has written a marvelous account of his company's war (14 Abrams tanks) from the months leading to the operation \\"Iraqi Freedom\\" to the actual battles with the enemy, and his writing style is very factual and right to the point. Conroy gives many details about the kind of personnel that crewed the Abrams tanks, their training and doctrine, the confusion of battles, the attrocious weather in western Iraqi desert, the plight of the Iraqi civilians, the two daring \\"Thunder Runs\\" inside Baghdad on April 5 and 7 and the controversial matter of the looting of the Iraqi National Museum. I found extremely interesting the efforts that Conroy's men did in order to save the badly hit tank \\"Cojone, Eh?\\" during the first Thunder Run (that particular vehicle was seen destroyed in Iraqi TV with Iraqis triumphantly dancing on it) as well as the description of the first two months after the end of the campaign in Baghdad and Fallujah. This is a highly recommended book for everyone who wants to see how reality does not follow any script and how real battles are full of surprises even in an era of satellite communications and super-accurate weapons.	2005-06-13

It contains though the bitter truth behind the horrible number 2,3 which is the daily average number of coalition (mainly US) deaths in Iraq from March 2003 to the present day. It is very interesting to learn what the American soldiers have to say about their mission in Iraq and their remarks concerning the Iraqi people and the suffering there. But Moore did not give voice to the other opinions and wrote a book which clearly served as a propaganda weapon against Bush for the 2004 elections.The outcome of those elections proved that Moore's thesis was not entirely right or not enough convincing and showed that US people may have their doubts but are determined to finish the job in Iraq and smash terrorism. It is also disappointing to read that young Americans chose to join the US military just for making money for college, as if they didn't know that military's job is war and war (from time immemorable) is about killing people and destroying things. It gives though a hint for the current rapid decline of enlistments which threatens to erode US Army's efficiency more devastatingly an permanently than losses in Iraq.	2005-06-10

Written before 2003 the book lacks any mention to the operation \\"Iraqi Freedom\\" and is somehow dated. Although there are some good parts, especially those regarding the satellites and their role and capabilities, the text becomes often very repetitive stressing the same arguments over and over. There is also a temptation for overreliance on new technology which is considered as a modern panacea for winning wars. Overall, it is not a bad start for someone who wants to learn something about the structural and doctrinal problems that modern US military faces today, but I would recommend instead Macgregor's \\"Transformation Under Fire\\" which is more complete and overturns many myths.	2005-06-02

In this book he devotes 101 pages to the planning and the operational execution of the \\"Iraqi Freedom\\" (which is the best part of the book) supporting a thesis which I also had some weeks before the start of the operation, that US Army went into battle with inadequate forces, taking dangerous and unnecessary risks and creating many problems in the postwar Iraq. The next 60 pages are an analysis why the US engagement in Iraq was a flawed strategy which threatens to bog down and attrite the magnificent US Army and leave Al Qaeda free to regroup and mount its next deadly attack. Unfortunately the book was published shortly before the US 2004 elections, when Clark was a candidate for the Democrats and thus the last chapter which is labeled \\"Beyond Empire: A new America\\" covers 40 rather boring pages presenting a litany of the well known arguments about US moral superiority, the need for cooperation with the traditional European allies and a demonstration of financial knowledge which is a prerequisite for a presidential nominee. It would be far better if Clark had devoted these pages to his opinions about the US military transformation, recommending the best strategies regarding the problems with Iran and North Korea. If you want a short byt sound operational analysis of the war in Iraq, you'd better choose Thomas Donnelly's \\"Operatio Iraqi Freedom: A Strategic Assessment\\" despite its few shortcomings.	2005-05-31

It is essentially a spy thriller with the story built around the Russo-turkish war of 1877-78, which ended with the liberation of a great part of the Balkans (and especially Bulgaria) from the turkish yoke. One of the most dramatic moments of that war was the siege of Plevna where Osman pasha pinned down the Russian Army for 143 crucial days. Looking at those events through the eyes of a young lady who travels to Bulgaria to meet her fiance, Akunin weaves a fine story of mystery, courage and betrayal with many unexpected turns and twists untel the end. The characters are well presented, as well as the atmosphere of the era where the extreme violence in battle went hand in hand with the noble courtesy to women. A nice adventure with some dose of Balkan history.	2005-05-16

The focus of the book is on the strategic level of the war, thus the reader will find only a few remarks about the actual military operations. It is very useful though as food for thought and gives interesting interpretations regarding some crucial decisions taken during the war. The diplomatic maneuvers of Hanoi are very well presented as are the numerous sources which prove that the top US military leadership was perhaps more responsible for losing the war than its political masters. The book gave me also some remarkable information about the reasons for which the US fought the Vietnam War without strong support from its traditional allies, why the military was prevented from striking North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia even when it was obvious that the communists used these countries as sanctuaries, what was the role of intelligence gathering, the economics of the conflict and the true influence of the anti-war movement. The main conclusion of the book is that Hanoi would probably have won the war no matter what the USA would have done and no matter how well its military had fought. \\"What emerges with great clarity from the chapters is that the Vietnam War was really many wars, but only one that finally counted for the Vietnamese. Its victims were primarily the Vietnamese, and its victors were the Vietnamese. Fifty years on, historians will look at the Cold War and wonder why the Americans did not understand better the folly of their attempt at nation - building. Vietnamese infiltrators into the Saigon regime's innermost councils escaped detection, while the countryside was ruled by the enemy whenever there was not the actual presence of American troops. The reality of Vietnam War was as elusive to American policymaker as the enemy forces were to the men they sent to this hall of mirrors. They saw only their own reflections multiplied over and over\\".    If that was so, then we must accept that the Vietnamese kind of war has really no antidote until today and that the combination of nationalism and fanaticism (with a clever and asymmetrical application of brute force) can prevail over democracy and freedom, which is a bad omen for the current US engagement in Iraq. I don't believe that Hanoi would have won the war in any case, nor that it could sustain casualties forever and I think that the main reason for the US defeat was rather the prevailing view that no real American interests were at stake over there, at that particular period.	2005-05-09

The narrative is full of the horror felt by the ordinary soldiers and junior leaders, down to the platoon and section level, as well as the frustration for the tactical decisons made by the top leadership of the 101st Airborne Division during those hectic days. He points that, more than the \\"Tet Offensive\\", the battle for \\"Hamburger Hill\\" was a critical turning point for the US involvement in the Vietnam War and he gives much evidence of the turmoil it caused among the US public opinion. The book has a black and white map for every day of the battle and some medium quality b/w photographs, but its main weak point (for which it loses the fifth star) is the fact that is exclusively focused on the American side of the story and does not give any information regarding the elite 29th Regiment of the PAVN (not even the name of its commander!) which fought with such tenacity all those days under the most brutal bombardment from ground and air.	2005-04-25

Canadian Evan McGorman was one of the selected few who not only served in the Legion but was accepted to the elite 2 REP parachute regiment. His book is a splendid and very realistic introduction to the harsh realities of the Legion and he takes care to destroy many myths that surround the life there. He is adamantly against the idea of spending five years in this French elite unit of mercenaries but he also cherises the memories of the great moments he lived in its ranks. One can not find a better source for information regarding any trivial detail of preparation for Legion service as well as a wealth of advices in order to avoid the worst situations once been there. A sober reminder that French Foreign Legion is not an adventure to be taken lightly and also that the French Army is a rather tough outfit, despite the US perceptions to the contrary.	2005-04-11

Although it features a rather long introduction to the battle of Berlin (almost 300 pages are devoted to what happened a few months and weeks before the last climactic battle), as it starts from the Vistula - Oder operation in January 12, 1945 the power of his writing and the research he had made in archives from both sides of the hill are really awesome. War is presented in its real face, from the top commanders and the strategic planners to the \\"down the earth\\" soldiers living in horrendous conditions. The plight of the civilians is also well documented and Beevor spares no effort to condemn the barbarity of Soviet soldiers against German women. The book is easily read, it is full of powerful and moving scenes of human drama and uses many examples of the strange irony of war and the presence (or absence) of pure lack. The author provides good maps for the reader to follow the story and some black and white photographs but the real essence of the book is its ability to transfer the reader to the terrible battle of Berlin in an unforgettable way. Very highly recommended for those who seek the perfect balance between military history and the social turmoil of modern war in its most horrible version.	2005-04-01

In this book he recounts the last battles of World War II in the Eastern Front which took place in 1945, namely the Vistula - Oder operation, the Berlin operation and the Prague operation in very analytical and readable style. As commander of the powerful 1st Ukrainian Front, Konev was at the thick of action and his presentation of operational problems and the tips of moving large armoured and mechanized formations is evenly balanced with the description of the personalities of various commanders who served under him. Although he was a devout communist, Konev does not deny praise to the German Army and its tenacity in fighting a losing battle.	2005-03-31

Richard Sorge was a charismatic communist idealist who became a useful tool at the hands of GRU and set a highly efficient network of spies inside Japan from 1933 to 1941. Whymant proves that many things that are known about Sorge are pure myths (like that he was arrested in bed, while lying in the arms of a Japanese beauty) and constructs a wonderful story of the man and his era, jumping from the great strategic issues to the twists and oddities of that extremely dynamic and charming personality. I found extremeley sad the fact that Sorge was so afraid of returning to the USSR (where he was considered a drunkard, a womanizer and a trotskist) albeit he served her so well, and he felt so lonely that let himself to be trapped by the agents of the \\"Tokko\\" secret police. Also mysterious was his behavior after his arrest when he cooperated completely with his captors providing them with a wealth of information on GRU's actions in Japan. A highly recommende book for the fans of deadly spying games on  a grand scale.	2005-03-21

The book leaves no unturned stone in the sparsely explored field of Red Army in the period 1941-43 and is full of statistics, tables, details and expert analysis. Although some of the chapters present little interest, like those of the rear support services and other have been the subject of thorough studies (like the tank formations and the artillery), I found the most interesting part to be that of the top military leadership and the fate of the various commanders from the level of the Corps upwards. One must be warned though that this book is not for the layman, nor for someone who has only a passing interest in the subject. For readers that want a more readable work on the Red Army I would suggest Mackintosh's \\"Juggernaut\\" and for those that love the wealth of details and are fascinated by the hard facts of statistics but do not want to pore through 700 pages, Walter Dunn's excellent book \\"Hitler's Nemesis: The Red Army 1933-45\\".	2005-03-11

I must say that I had only minimum knowledge about the stories presented here, but when I was able to compare data from the \\"Sorge\\" chapter of this book against Whymant's masterful book \\"Stalin's Spy\\", I was somewhat disappointed by the numerous mistakes and the plethora of annoyning errors that Volkman's work includes.

Although he gives only a few details about the other trials to destroy that ship by Chariots and X-craft, the story of the RAF and AAF attacks is really compelling and very well told. Details of the weapons used are also presented, especially those of the famous Tallboy bomb and there some very good maps and a few black and white photos. The other side of the hill is also covered, with attention to the reports of the German Admiralty and the commanders of the ship. Overall, an excellent account of the determined and persistent British efforts to put that mighty warship out of action and get rid of a constant danger to their Arctic convoys, something that was finally achieved rather late in the war.	2005-02-24

In this book he recounts many of his wartime adventures, at least as far as his memory perimtted, because the writing was made many years after the war. Bessonov was a junior officer who commanded a platoon of 12 - 20 tank riders, the men who rode in battle on top of the Soviet tanks, mainly T-34s and later IS-2s. Although he saw much action and was wounded some times he was not lucky when it came to promotion and didn't manage to command his own company. Albeit he made the Army his carreer after the end of the war. The book is important because it presents the war from the view of a simple Soviet warrior and is particularly revealing regarding the strength of the Luftwaffe even late in 1944 (when according to history books German aircraft had been disappeared from the sky of the Eastern Front, but quite the contrary was true!) and of the qualities of the German soldiers, whom he regarded as tough, well trained, cunning and strong opponents, from whom one could expect anything, anytime. Bessonov started his wartime carreer in August 1943 and finished it just a week before the fall of Berlin, when he was seriously wounded fron an artillery shell. The book contains some good maps but many of the places mentioned are not to be found on them. I didn't also understand why the translator kept calling the artillery and mortar rounds as \\"mines\\" throughout the text.	2005-02-16

Most people know the Goumiers from their action in the final Cassino battle, in May 1944, but as Edward Bimberg says in his book they served also in many other engagements in Tunisia, Sicily, Corsica, Elba Island, Provence, Alsace and Germany. The book is recommended for anyone seriously interested in the subject but although it contains an order of battle of the various \\"Goums\\" in the Appendices it doesn't have a single map, so a good background in World War II history is required. It contains also only three black and white photos.	2005-02-16

Although it contains a very thorough overview of the political and diplomatic relations of the two countries from 1947 to 1979, analysing many issues ranging from the Chinese community in Vietnam to the US-Chinese and Soviet-Vietnamese relations, the actual military operations of the war are covered in only 16 pages of a single chapter (number 5). The writing is also completely dry, reminding official diplomatic report. For someone who's looking for a better military account I would recommend \\"PLA Warfighting\\" which is much more detailed on the subject, and also \\"Brother Enemy\\" by Nayan Chanda which has an easily read narrative, albeit it focuses on the Vietnam invasion of Cambodia (December 1978 - January 1979).	2005-02-07

Patrick Rambaud has achieved though a magnificent success presenting the little known battle of Aspern-Essling (1809) in a detailed and very realistic way using a mix of historical characters and fictional heroes. The tactics, the experience of battle, the sounds, the smoke, the disorientation, the cruelty and the human misery of the typical napoleonic battlefield is expertly given, with many unforgettable scenes like the destruction of the french bridges on the Danube, the burning of the villages, the atrocities against the innocent population, the horrible treatment of the wounded and the blind strokes of Fate during the battle itself. It is true that Rambaud presents only the French side and does not tell anything about the Austrians, but this adds reality to the story because transfers the reader to the place of ordinary soldiers who are ignorant of the enemy's intentions and strength and fell surrounded by the famous \\"fog of war\\" according to Clausewitz's term. As for who won the Aspern-Essling battle, there is no doubt that the French suffered a tactical defeat but no wholesale destruction, such as that they themselves inflicted on the enemy in the battle of Wagram, a month later. Regarding the historical characters, Rambaud spares no effort to paint with vivid colours the celebrated marshals of France like Massena, lannes, Davout, Bessieres and Berthie with all their virtues and vices, emphasising above all their absolute and almost religional devotion to their emperor. I was really shocked by the way that Napoleon is presented, as an uncultured opportunist, brutal, rude and selfish dictator who didn't hesitate to insult his most trusted and faithfull aids, cynically analysing the battle and sending tens of thousands of troopsto their death and mutilation, while himself remained detached from the horror of battle enjoying a comfortable living. To be fair this portrait is probably not far away from the real person.	2005-02-04

The \\"Exploits and Adventures of Birgadier Gerard\\" is surely one of the finest novels about the Napoleonic era and I highly recommend it to any fan of the Grand Armee and its battle hardened soldiers. The story begins with the long retired Brigadier starting to recall his war memories for the shake of his audience, over a glass of wine. And what a fascinating carreer did he have! He was a romantic lover, a proud Frenchman, an honest man, a terrific swordsman, a dashing cavalryman, and a soldier absolutely faithful to his duty: the real epitome of the French hussar who according to Colonel Lassale \\"should not live beyond the age of 30\\"! The old Brigadier explains with graphic detail and an amusing dose of egotism and pride how he lost his ear for the love of a girl in Venice, how he helped French troops to storm the spanish fortress of Saragossa, how he saved a whole army in the Peninsula, how he extricated himself from a grevious tactical mistake in Russia, how he beat the Englishmen in their national sport of fox-hunting and how Destiny prevented him from taking part in the climactic battle of Waterloo, a fact that Gerard honestly believes that doomed Napoleon! To build his story Doyle took many interesting facts and legends from real biographies of the period, like that of Baron de Marbot, but he made his story so enjoyable and colourful that is incomperable in terms of advenures and amusement.	2005-01-28

It is true that the book does not have the maps which would help the reader to locate the geographical dimension of Napoleon's carreer and actions, and the author does not include dates inside his text, but if someone wants a pure operational history of the French armies can look to the appropriate atlases like that of V. Esposito and J. Elting, or the magnificent \\"The Campaigns of Napoleon\\" by David Chandler. The main merit of Ludwig's book is its immediacy, the clarity of Napoleon's thoughts and decision making and of course the excellent writing which has an astonishing freshness no matter how many times one reads the book. By seting himself free from the grip of time and place Ludwig can build his story like a fairy tale, which I found truly remarkable and unusual. There are many studies regarding Napoleon as a man and a general, but this one is definitely one of the best.	2005-01-25

The author is a renowned military writer and a specialist on Frederick the Great's campaigns, a fact that served him well in his attempt to recount the terrible and fast-paced battles of the closing months of World War II in the East. The account is evenly balanced between the German and the Soviet side and so is the criticism for the mistakes commited by the two mighty and ruthless opponents. The period covered does not include the capture of Berlin, but this is not so important because the fate of the Third Reich was sealed months before, during the horrible battles of Poland, East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia. However the book suits more the military history fan than the layman, it requires a solid backround on WW II and is not to be read like Anthony Beevor's popular works. Duffy writes in his introduction that \\"\\"Red Storm on the Reich\\" stands as an atrocious book, in the literal sense of theat term. I have limited the story of destruction as far as I could to that of landscape and machines, and I hope that I have given no satisfaction to lovers of the pronography of violence\\". I think that he has fully achieved his aim. He presents the operations in a crystal clear way, with the aid of numerous and very good maps, and the editing is excellent, leaving only a few typos. I was especially impressed by his bibliography whic I found very useful. It is not particularly extensive but it includes many first hand accounts as well as some rare and authoritative sources on the subject. The Appendix named \\"The Conduct of War: Soviet Science and German Art\\" is also an extremely interesting analysis of the technical and operational matters of the campaign.	2005-01-12

Unfortunately Mr Hammond's writing is monotonous, boring, and awefully repetitive. When the story is going to be really interesting regarding Boyd's flying experience, or the Energy Maneuver philosophy, or the jet fighters' characteristics, the author turns to trivial matters like Boyd's friendly relations with his colleagues, or endlessly eulogizing him for his trials, etc. The excellent work of LFM in the case of F-16 is compressed in a few pages which failed miserably to stirr my interest.

I had studied the Napoleonic Wars for a long time before reading Unsworth's book and I thought that I had a good idea of the fighting conditions and the psychology of that period. \\"Losing Nelson\\" proved me wrong and opened widely in front of my eyes a wonderful history of a facinating personality. Unsworth uses his main hero, problematic Charles Cleasby, as a fanatical admirer of lord Nelson and builds a story where Cleasby's miserable and monotonous life is interwoven with that of the near mythical hero of the seas. Although Cleasby's psychological profile is revealed and explained in a masterful way, I regard Unsworth's presentation of Nelson's life and battles as the real gem of the book. Cape St Vincent, West Indies, Santa Cruz, the Nile, Copenhagen, Trafalgar and above all, the Naples controversial issue, are described in a terrific storm of literature. The words are carefully selected, the scenes are vividly described, the historical characters are painted in an unforgettable way. I couldn't stop reading the book and I devoured the pages until the strange finale of crime and catharsis. The book fired my interest to the Nelsonian period of naval battles and made me buy no more than five books on the subject, through which I verified Unsworth's excellent details. \\"Losing Nelson\\" is historical fiction in the most powerful form and I heartily recommend it to every history buff.	2005-01-03

Between these two categories stand the memoirs of the commanders involved and this book by Lt General DeLong is a very good example of a work where the personal views are mixed with the gretaer picture of the world war against terrorism. DeLong is a hardened Marine veteran and the time he served as deputy commander of the busy CentCom was a fascinating one, marked by the exceptional and innovative campaigns \\"Enduring Freedom\\" and \\"Iraqi Freedom\\". The writer presents an insider's look to the crusial planning and battle management and reveals many details about the personalities involved, like Franks and Rumsfeld. He confronts \\"armchair generals\\" with justified anger, concerning their criticism for the operation \\"Iraqi Freedom\\" but his insistence regarding Iraq's WMD is groundless, to say the least. (He writes that \\"On another matter of controversy, let me say that we will eventually find Iraqi WMD. The intelligence evidence we had before the war was too overwhelming to be wrong\\"). I think that DeLong is either unwilling to accept the obvious but terrible truth or he simply does his duty defending the US political and military leadership over a bad argument. <br /> <br />The general uses plain language throughout the book, explaining in a fine way complicated military issues like \\"jointness\\" and he reduces the personal details to a minimum prefering to give emphasis to the war story itself. The problem is that this is not a professional operational account of the campaigns which would thrill a military history buff, since DeLong doaes not describe even the main ground units participating in the operations, nor the reasons behind their choice for assignement. He does not include appropriate campaign maps, also. Obviously this was done in order to attract a wider audience and I suppose that this target has been achieved because the staff work on top level is very well described and explained.	2005-01-03

When I finished reading this book I could hardly believe that a writer could prophesize the future war events in such a clear way. Van Creveld's thesis is that war as we know it in the last 3,5 centuries (waged between states and organized armies) has reached its end and is now in a process of radical tramsformation. Analyzing many examples from the military history he suggests that we are entering into an era where states lose the monopoly of waging war and confront non-state actors who do not embrace the same philosophical values.<br /><br />Van Creveld overturns Clauzewitz's traditional views one by one, using very convincing arguments, and unfortunately he is confirmed by international events today. While reading the book there were many cases when I was dumbfounded by the fact that a writer completing his work near the end of the Cold War could see our era with such a clarity, and I was really amazed by the fact that the book was written in 1991. It is more modern than anything else I have read on the subject of modern war and surpasses even contemporary analysis. Van Creveld does not avoid to touch even hot topics, like the sheer joy of fighting (paraphrasing Clausewitz he states that war is more the continuation of sports by other means than politics) the taboo of introducing women in the armies, the role of religion in the motivation of war and the very important argument that war does not begin when someone is willing to kill but when he is willing to die for a cause.<br /><br />The accuracy of his predictions is often so amazing that it becomes terrifying, especially when he states that in the future the war leaders will not be legitimate government officials but something like \\"The Old Man in the Mountains\\", meaninig the kind of warfare waged by assassins in the Middle Ages. He is also very critical against the current military-industrial complex and its super-expensive creations of high tech weapons, saying that all this paraphernalia of old war are like dinosaurs about to face extinction. This is a highly recommended book and it is sure that it will challenge many of your establised views on war.ut to face extinction.

Mr Evans has found an unturned stone in the heavily explored field of warfare. Although prior to his work there had been published some authoritative books on the subject of the Roman legions like Parker's excellent study \\"The Roman Legions\\", Evan's book is more compact, more clear, better organized and follows the modern military way of presenting an army's order of battle. A short history of deployment of every Roman legion is included and this makes the book an invaluable reference source. The introduction is also excellent giving some good details on the nature of the legions and the Praetorian Guard up to its catastrophic defeat at the hands of Constantine at Milvian Bridge (AD 312). The Appendices are very useful and contain a full list of all the emperors who served with the legions, all the prefects of the Praetorian Guard in a chronological list, and some maps with the geographic location of the imperial legions from Augustus' period until that of Trajan. Highly recommended for both old students of the Roman army and beginners on the subject.	2004-12-07

I knew Thomas Donnelly from his older book \\"Clash of Chariots\\" but I must say that this new work is much more mature and suprisingly comprehensive. It is probably the best short operational history of Operation Iraqi Freedom that one can find, including unknown details from the planning period prior to the launch of the campaign. I think that this is the kind of book that I expected to read by prominent military historians like John Keegan, but Donnelly is the one to deliver the true military aspects of the campaign. Although there are a few annoying errors inside the book (like those on pages 70 and 71 where the Marine RCTs and the respective routes they took are wrong), it is the best and most complete strategic picture of the campaign as it was conceived and executed by CENTCOM. The problems start with the chapter regarding the \\"insurgency\\" in Iraq and it is obvious that the author covers only the 2003 period up to the arrest of Saddam Husein. Thus he misses the important next phases like the peak of US losses in April 2004 due to the Sadr rebellion in Najaf, the loss of control of major cities by the coalition troops and the recent operations in Fallujah. Assessing the post-war strategic picture the author comes to contradictory conlcusions stating that the insurgency is not cohesive, it lacks external support and will eventualy collapse soon, but unfortunately the facts do not support this thesis. Iraq is not Vietnam yet (the US losses are 10 times smaller) but it threatens to become like it. It is probably too soon to judge the scope and the success of the insurgency, as well as its effects on the war on terror. The most significant negative point of the book is the total absence of maps and the reader must study it with the excellent maps of the book \\"March Up\\" in hand.	2004-11-15

US	17677108	R1WW4BVT5J1SCF	1583481001	869710629	The Air Campaign: Revised Ed.	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A very good synthesis	John Warden's book earned high praise because of its author's role in planning operation Desert Storm, but although the book is a very good synthesis of air warfare theory it is not either groundbreaking or revolutionary. In fact most of its arguments were presented for the first time by the pioneers of air power of the 1920s and 30s like Giulio Duhet and William Mitschell. Warden's contribution has more to do with the revival of those forgotten theories and the presentation of a complete picture of aerial operations instead of inventing new methods of war. Central to his thesis is the idea that air superiority is crucial, that a campaign will be lost if the enemy has it, that in many circumsatnces it alone can win a war, and that its possession is needed before other actions on the ground or in the air can be undertaken. <br /> <br />Warden also places emphasis on thorough training saying that if something is going to be done in war, it ought to be practiced in peace, and if it has not be practiced, losses are likely to be high and the plan is unlikely to go as expected. He analyzes the three kinds of inderdiction (distant, indermediate and close) and he gives an interesting definition of the term \\"close air support\\": \\"It is an air operation that theoritically could and would be done by ground forces on their own, if sufficient troops or artillery were available\\". <br /> <br />The author repeats often the great value of striking the enemy's center of gravity, that timing is everything in the commitment of air reserves and that ground and naval forces can serve as an adjunct to air forces in the battle for air superiority. His opinion that fighting defensively is the worst way to fight an air war is uneiversally accepted as is his thesis that numbers are important, so important that a primary goal of the operational commander ought to be to make sure that his forces outnumber the enemy every time they meet. Modern research using the Lancaster equations has also proved his argument that the large force almost always inflicts greater absolute casualties on the smaller force and thath it also suffers less in the process. <br /> <br />John Warden also explains in the Epilogue how his concept of ideas was implemented in the Desert Storm campaign of 1991. In that case the enemy was visualized as a target system of five concentric rings (leadership, key production, infrastructure, population and field forces) with the leadership ring at the center. In the case of Iraq, the US goal was \\"to reduce the energy level of the entire system enough to reach our peace objectives\\" which were to eject \\"Iraq out of Kuwait and an Iraq that would not be a strategically threatening regional superpower for the next decade\\". <br /> <br />On the minus side of the book are the extremely poor black and white pictures.	2004-10-25

The author has a clear argument regarding the construction of the Atlantic Wall, the strategic and operational reasons behind this decision and the German command arrangements and frictions in the West. The books does not go in great lengths regarding the details but it uses the kind of first hand information that applies to me: the microfilmed archives of the Wehrmacht High Command (OKW) and a welth of other German sources. The writing style is very good albeit with a few mistakes due to bad editing and the information is presented in a very clear chronological way which captivates the reader. I had never before pay attention, for example, to von Rundsetdt's 50 pages report of October 23, 1944 and the consequences of his estimations, nor had I read in such a clear form about the German plans and moves regarding the possible Allied attacks in Portugal, Spain and Southern France. Although very few pages are devoted to the actual operations of the D-Day landings, the subsquent Normandy campaign and the 15 August landings in the French Mediterranean coast, and almost none to the Allied planning and intentions, I think that Alan Wilt has made clear his point that Atlantic Wall did achieve a part of his objective by keeping the Allies out of the important Atlantic ports and thus causing the great logistics crisis of September 1944. \\"The Atlantic Wall\\" is a very good book which will be useful as a quick reference to anyone interested in the German strategy in the West during the 1940-44 period. The reader must be warned though that the subtitle \\"Rommel's plans to thwart the Allied Invasion\\" is rather deceptive, as Rommel is not the central figure of this study nor the only one. The book is easy to read and contains some good general maps, among them a precise map of the German order of battle in June 1944 and although it does not avoid a few reptitions along the way, it is worth themoney.	2004-10-14

Without a doubt he was a most capable officer for the job he undertook and his on the spot promotion to Lt General proved the great value of his work. The best parts of the book were those where Pagonis came close to General Shwarzkopf, either to receive laconic instructions or to guarantee that everything will be ready on time for the great outflanking maneuver he planned. Pagonis is a living example of what Greeks can achieve when they work inside a meritocracy system, open to talents like the american model (the complete opposite of what Greek political system encourages in our country in the last decades), and he gives many tips for the military and civilian logistician, like the stand-up morning meetings, the use of the 3X5 cards for the flow of information, the \\"ghostbusters\\" idea of mobile problem solvers, the great value of the vision in the leader's mind and how it can be materialised in the lower echelons and many more. Although I would like to learn more about the myriad details of army logistics, I understand that Pagonis' target was not to drawn his readers into the sea of information he handled but to outline the principles of his command and management style. I would recommend reading Douglas Menarchik's excellent \\"Powerlift\\" as a more data heavy companion to Pagonis' book.	2004-10-05

As the author says in the introduction \\"logistics is the nine tenths of war\\" and he is absolutely right. Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm took the US Army by surprise but the massive airlift and sealift commenced in the six months following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was a real marvel of planning and dedication, despite the myriads of everyday problems. Mr Menarchik has written a book for the nuts and bolts of military science and produces the most convincing answers as to which military operations are feasible and which are not. Poring through the wealth of data and the numerous tables the reader can find answers to all the critical issues of the Gulf War: How much time did the US forces need to deploy a deterrent force to Saudi Arabia and why? How were aircraft and ships used to assist to the build up of the necessary military concentration? Which were the deficiencies of the US plans and how were they overcomed? How did president Bush choose the January 15th as the final day for the ultimatum to the Iraqis and what was the connection with military logistics? How did the end of the Cold War help the US forces to transfer the powerful VII Corps from Germany to Saudi Arabia? What was the capacity of airbases, ports and roads in the Saudi kingdom? What would be the consequences if the Iraqi Army had moved in early August to conquer the whole west coast of the Gulf? The book is a real gem and is higlhy recommended to every serious student of military history. I wish we will have in the future a similar thorough study for the logistics of Operation Iraqi Freedom.	2004-09-09

It is a pity to see a renowned military historian to treat a modern campaign like OIF in such a general and boring manner. I'm eagerly waiting for his next real hit which will be equivalent to \\"The Face of Battle\\".

It is hard to believe that an analyst can pack so much detailed information in such a few pages, but this book is a real gem for the serious reader of military matters who wants to formulate a realistic view of the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams doctrine. The calculations regarding the current ability of the US Army to transport SBCTs around the world are exhaustive and revealing and one gets a fine sense of how complicated are the tasks of the American war planners. Time, distances, port and airport capacities, weights and aircraft lifting capacities are examined against realistic scenarios of war crises around the globe. The US Army should think a lot more about the need to transform more than six brigades to SBCTs. Heavy forces are still very important (and I think that they will remain so in the next decades) and the airlift is not the strategic panacea of the 21st century.	2004-09-03

Ralph Peters has the talent to present his ideas with exemplary clarity without being repetitive or boring. Although he can't conceal his Republican sentiments and his contempt for the Clinton policy regarding the Al Qaeda and Iraqi threat, he gives a fine analysis of the current geostrategic environment and the kind of threats that Western civilization faces. His views regarding the militant Islam and Osama bin Laden are based on solid facts but they are rather stretched sometimes with conclusions like \\"extremist Islamists fear the girls\\". The epithets \\"killers\\" or \\"murderers\\" are also overused when he refers to Al Qaeda operatives, but I think that if it is a characteristic of the Islamic terrorists that we can't deny it's their immense courage and self-sacrifice (no matter the cause they are fighting for). US and the West must respect their opponents and their ferocity and not try to degrade them with epithets (it is understandable that during a war you have to cultivate hate against the enemy but this must not lead to fatal underestimation of his strengths). The best part of the book is in my opinion the second one (\\"Our Wars\\") which contains articles that Peters wrote before and during the Operation Iraqi Freedom. The author should be proud of his clear judgement and forethought when a lot of media people saw only doom and failure, and also for his courage to blame Defense Secretary and his entourage for their naive instistence to wage a war with inadequate land forces (a fact that became painfully obvious in the postwar Iraq).	2004-08-25

I first learned about DiMercurio after reading The Complete Idiot's Guide to Submarines which is a very good treatise of the subject. The author surely knows a lot about nuclear submarines and has a fine grasp of technical details. The story is built upon a rather unrealistic scenario where Soviet Admiral Alexei Novskoyy plans to blakmail both superpowers to disarm from their nuclear ballistic missiles, but in order to achieve this he sends 80 Soviet submarines near the US East Coast, while himself remains onboard the last marvel of nuclear submersible colossus, the \\"Kaliningrad\\" of 60.000 tons, whisch sails under the protection of the polar ice cap. The problem is that Novskoyy has destroyed an American submarine some years ago, and so the son of the fallen US captain, Commander Michael Pacino who is now CO of the nuclear attack submarine \\"Devilfish\\" is on the way to intercept \\"Kaliningrad\\" and take her SPL (Sound Pressure Level) map. The second main defect of the book is that Pacino finds \\"Kaliningrad\\" rather easily and bumps her in order to provoke Novskoyy to fire first. The battle which ensues is an interesting one, mainly because the Soviets use a 100 cm nuclear tipped torpedo of 60 knots speed. The method of avoiding this super-weapon and return fire is excellently described as well as the cataclysmic results of an underwater nuclear explosion (better than Patrick Robinson did in his fine book \\"Nimitz Class\\"). The strong point of the author is his knowledge of nuclear reactor workings and not tactics, and he goes in multi-page details analyzing the procedures of reactor re-activation and damage control. Probably DiMercurio likes to keep the rare tactical tips as a reserve for use in future novels. The finale is surprisingly realistic and the book wins many points because of this, but the particular climax dereved a better seek-and-hide game before the torpedo firing. I have already purchased two more books of DiMercurio and I'm eager to find out his next stories.	2004-08-23

This is one of the rare times that I have read a book in two successive days and there is a good reason. The battle of Crete remains one of the least known episodes of World War II, but it is extremely significant since it marked the absolute zenith of the Wehrmacht's might, just before it embarked on the disastrous Operation Barbarossa. Nothing seems to escape from von der Heydte's attention: the historical background of Crete, the landscape of the island and the personalities of his own soldiers whom he describes with vivid pictures. Von der Heydte was a battalion commander of the dreaded and elite German paratroopers who assaulted Crete against its British, Australian, New Zealander and Greek defenders in May 1941, and although he didn't fight in the crucial Maleme sector but in the neighbouring Galata-Canea area, he witnessed the whole drama of the battle. The operation \\"Merkur\\" was the brainchild of German General Kurt Student who had taken every possibility into consideration but then everything turned out contrary to plans and expectations. The author describes in excellent detail the combat jump, the chaos of the first hours on Cretan soil, the fierce enemy resistance, the painful losses, the hunger, the thirst and the desperation of the first days when the battle was hunging on a balance, so that the Berlin radio made its first mention of the attack on Crete five days after the beginning of the battle! Here and there a paragraph is a real gem of literature proving that the baron's pen is at least as mighty as his sword. The chapter \\"The Dressing Station\\" is one of the best I have ever read. Humour, horror, human relationships, personal drama and the solitary burden of leadership in battle are interwoven in a marcellously told story, which does not omit the broader view from the Generals' aspect. Von der Heydte has written a real masterpiece of military literature, although he was fighting from the side of an evil regime.	2004-08-23

The author presents many sources from which the reader can draw the near certainty that militant Islam has already many nuclear suitcase-bombs in its possesion and has hired the Soviet and Pakistani experts to maintain and operate them, along with thousands of willing suicide bombers who long to detonate them. Even more terrifying is the quite high possibility that such weapons have already been smuggled insiede the USA and Al Qaeda awaits with exemplary patience the right moment to produce a horrible \\"American Hiroshima\\". One can not avoid the thought that Osama bin Laden would not have dared to provoke the US colossus in such a way as with the 9/11 attacks, if he didn't have a mightier weapon in stock for the next and more catastrophic strike. \\"Osama's Revenge\\" is full of evidence and data concerning this apalling evenduality but also presents a short and marvellous overview of the campaign in Afghanistan and the many mistakes and clumsy operations of US and British forces there. Of special historic value are also the full texts of the declarations of war from Osama bin Laden against the West in August 1996 and February 1998, included in the Appentices.	2004-08-23
US	17677108	RRRA405BY7R0X	0425159116	464702962	SSN: Strategies of Submarine Warfare	Books	2	8	13	N	N	Rather disappointing	A rather disappointing book from master writer Clancy, which resemples a \\"shoot-em up\\" game where all enemy submarines are easily killed by a US submarine (USS \\"Cheyenne\\") in 15 highly unrealistic scenarios. The class 688I boat is able to sink more than 60 Chinese submarines with astonishing ease. Her torpedoes never fail while Chinese weapons always miss their target and fall victims to decoys or mulfanctions. Clancy would have made a better book if the Chinese were reacting defensively and didn't have such an outraging incompetence as to have a diesel electric submarine in a war zone with its snorckel not operating! I'm interested mainly in the tactics of underwater warfare and here Clancy gives only a few tips. a very one-sided and completely unrealistic fictional book where Americans do all the damage and Chinese play the role of the siting ducks.	2004-08-23

The author has some interesting views on war generally and on the character of the US soldiers in particular, but he fails to give a pwerful image of this very importand campaign. It is true that action begins after thw first 70 pages and that the author talks a lot about himself and his personal experiences and inconviniences but these are not the main failures. The really disappointing feature is the absence of these small but interesting and little known details that thrill the readers who have not been witnesses themselves to the horrors and the adrenaline of a real battle.	2004-08-23

Edward Beach has created a submarine thriller with an atmosphere, although there are some adventures (like the fire on the carrier \\"Enterprise\\" while being in dry dock, or the saving of downed US fliers) that could be erased without affecting the overall story. The characters are ably described, the writer produces some unforgettable pictures of the periscope view and the crucial duel of Captain Richardson with the Japanese destroyer \\"Akikaze\\" (or \\"Bungo Pete\\") comes to crown the drama. Although the reader is led to suspect that such a duel will take place inevidently, I found it to be an anti-climax and \\"Bungo Pete\\" is destroyed rather easily (albeit Beach gives a few interesting tips on submarine tactics). I finished the book in 3 days and I consider it as one of the best in World War II military literature.	2004-08-23
