It's been out of print for years and will be very hard to find, I've seen it cheaper than here at Amazon but you will still have to pay a lot even for a used copy no matter where you find it.<br /><br />Originally brought out in Japan the book is in English, all that matters anyway, and has some very nice work- the trouble with that is you will remember almost all of it from other Sturges books. I've got a copy, I like it, but if you're on a budget and own Amazon's other Sturges books don't bother getting this one because the cost is too great for the novelty of a Japanese edition book with one or two \\"new\\" photos.	2005-10-06

I was surprised to see some pictures taken in Rhode Island, the later books seem to consist of France, California and Oregon with no East Coast U.S.  <br />As always with Mr. Sturges books the subject matter is mostly nude but there are several clothed photos here as well, more than will be found in later books. The style is all well done,(many very nice images), the book is certainly worth owning but doesn't seem quite the quality of the books from \\"Radiant Identities\\" onward.	2005-10-06

There is no table of contents which would help locate sections/items you may find yourself favoring. You may want to take notes on something to make it easier to find the next time you get the book out. <br />The text is a combination of the usual book type and hand written notes, I'm not sure why both are used.  <br />The artwork itself seems to run between sketches and very nicely done watercolors(?). Some of the art seems to be basically pencil work with little or no color but usually a lot of detail. The colored work is done the same way but more often has no background to the subject. The faeries themselves are most often depicted as either vaguely human or, some of them, very human like. Many of these last are at least partially nude, not much full frontal nudity, and seem to be mostly female. I prefer the more human types myself, nude or not. <br />I don't know if I'll be getting more of Mr. Froud's work but this book has some nice stuff in it.	2005-08-28

Mr. Stone spent two years traveling around New Mexico searching out and rephotographing scenes first done by others over a period of about 1855-1945. The book is divided into sections (of the state) and each photograph, past and present, has details about it included. <br />Mr. Stone writes about how some of the locations have changed a great deal, some not so much, many he could get to (or at least close enough) to duplicate exactly but others he had to do what he could to approximate the original shot. He doesn't say much about what he used for equipment other than some very tall ladders or tripods, no film details, not much camera information either. <br />I found that some things have changed a great deal while it appears some would look almost the same today to the original photographer as the original shot did. <br />I wish the author had included a town by town index as well as the regional listing, if you know the name of a town but are unsure of it's location you wll have to search each section for it- assuming it is there. <br />This is a very fascinating book, I'd like to go see many of these locations myself.	2005-08-27

Each of these sections consists primarily of architectural detail drawings of the chapter subject.  <br />There's a lot of detail here but I don't think it's enough for the total novice to go out and build from. You(if you're a novice)will need a lot more information on construction than is provided here. I guess that Amazon probably has all of the books you'll need, I think they do have all of the strawbale books listed in the short bibliography, those are worth a look.	2005-08-27

I've gotten most of the strawbale books Amazon has, this is one of the better ones to own. <br />I'm still in the process of reading it but I've found this book to be a sort of textbook for the person interested in the idea of possibly building a strawbale home. Looks like everything imaginable is covered, from all sorts of building details and construction methods to dealing with financing and zoning issues. <br />I don't see it as providing all the information an uneducated, inexperienced builder would need but you will find out enough to get started or to know that you don't want any part of the idea. There were lots of little details and tips, extensive end chapter notes, even a lot of photographs. Most of these were black and white (a little too small and indistinct for me)but some were in color. <br />While it isn't all you need it is a book worthy of your attention and worth owning.	2005-08-23

The pilot episode of Roswell was one of the better episodes of the series I've always thought, I got a copy of this book because it's the one the series is based on. While the writing style is probably aimed more at the teen market if you're older and liked the series this book won't be a bad item.  A few things are very different, Max is a blond and blue eyed senior, Liz is Liz Ortecho (whose dead older sister Rosa O'D on drugs)- instead of Parker, Michael Guerin is an A student (all three aliens are)and Isabel is the little sister- a junior in High School.  Liz's shooting is a little different than the series, Sheriff Valenti and son Kyle are meaner (and Valenti is a member of a secret government anti alien group). The incubation pods are mentioned, as is the cave, but in the book Michael came out of his pod days before the Evans (who shared a pod). A lot of things show similarity to the first season of Roswell, although not all were in the same episode- it seems obvious to me that the writers used this book as a sort of guide.  I don't know if I'll get the rest of the series but this one was a quick, fun little thing to read, and a lot more like what you saw on TV than most book to TV adaptations usually are.	2005-08-23

There is a small starter section, with pictures, on general construction details.<br />For each house there will be at least two, sometimes four or five, pages of text and pictures about the owners homes and how they were built. Don't buy this book thinking it's a build it manual, that isn't the case as the information is more of an idea book type presentation. You'll get a little on costs, size and other things including square feet both inside and outside the walls (along with small floor plans of each home) and several very well done photographs.<br />I found these photos to be the best part of the book as they will either give you some ideas for your own home or at least they'll show you what's out there. Some of the ideas had a Santa Fe look but some had a sharp edged box with lots of glass look (and not much straw either). Most of the homes were not displayed from all angles, just from selected views.<br />If you're on a strict budget you won't want this book unless you can find a cheap used copy, it's much more of an idea book.	2005-08-23

My problem was that it's been a couple of years since The Order of the Phoenix, I'd forgotten so many details. At 652 pages it's over 300 shorter than Phoenix but still a very easy book to read for it's size. <br />The book actually starts off with a nicer tone than Phoenix, which I liked, especially Dumbledore's meeting with the Dursley family. I think I noticed a little more swearing in the last book or two, this one might have just a bit more with damn or hell being used 3 or 4 times by one or another of the kids (it probably won't really bother anyone who is able to sit down and read the book). <br />Professor Snape is still cast as evil/ or not, there are a couple of surprises here about that- Draco Malfoy is still up to no good but you'll get a surprise there too. <br />The general formula seems to be much the same, if you liked the others you'll like this one as well. I hate waiting for the next, and final, book, It will have so much material in it that I can't see it being as \\"Short\\" as this one, I'm expecting it to be at least 700 pages.	2005-08-15

Written in 1982, 10 years before \\"The Doomsday Book\\", it's a short story about a 21st century Oxford University history student sent back to London in 1940 to help fight Nazi firebombs at St. Paul's Cathedral. Mr. Bartholomew had been preparing to be sent back to the time of St. Paul when the History Department decides to send him back to the London Blitz instead. At story's end we find that the purpose of the trip was not a mistake, it was to teach students that there are some things you cannot change. I think this might be Ms. Willis 1st time travel story, it has many of the later elements of \\"Doomsday\\" and \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\", but is less polished than her later efforts.  <br />The other 11 stories are a mix of things, ghost stories, post nuclear war, pre/post Rapture, SciFi- I found myself not caring for a lot of it, some could get offensive to some people (I think one had an F word or two in it too). All, including Firewatch, had an opening paragraph in which the author tells something about where she got her idea from- I did like that touch.	2005-08-05

This tie around the cowriter is Ingrid Seward, the editor of Majesty magazine and there is a decided difference in the two books. This one is even more \\"I\\"(Simmons promoting) than the first yet covers very much the same ground. Ms Simmons (or is it Seward, since the tone is different?) has written yet another biography of the late Princess, in her forward writing that Diana wanted her to write a book. That may be so but the Princess probably meant just ONE.<br /><br />Most of the stuff here you've read before, several times. This book takes a meaner tone in putting down James Hewitt, puts the Oliver Hoare affair on him -not Diana (which is unusual in these books),lots of ripping people. I give the Princess more credit for intelligence and cooking skills than I think Simmons does although I think she's probably at least close to right in Diana's reported over dependence on various therapists (Simmons was one of the few that wasn't a quack it seems). Paul Burrell gets bashed almost as much as Hewitt, Simmons seems to want us to believe that no one could have been as close to the Princess as she was. Seems like no one is spared judgement, not the Spencer family, not the Royal family.<br /><br />There's so much \\"I told Diana, she told me\\", the book is too self promotional for my tastes. That JFK jr. bit for an opener served what purpose?, must've been  to get people to buy the book because none of Diana's friends think there's any truth to it. I myself doubt that it ever happened because no one else, friend or foe of the Princess, has ever come out with that one. The book does have bits here and there that must be true (not just the historically verifiable items)and of historical interest but for me it was spoiled by a surplus of rather blatant self promotion- the book is an obvious effort at making money off a dead woman's memory.	2005-07-29

This is by my count her 3rd (4th?) Camilla book. <br />The book starts out, and ends, with a little bit about the recent marriage between Mrs. P.B. and the Prince of Wales but most of the bulk of the book is material you'll have already seen in another of Ms. Graham's books on Camilla. The cover photos are recent of course as is one B/W picture inside the book, but I do think I've read all the rest before. <br />Ms. Graham must be Camilla's greatest fan, seems to think more highly of her than perhaps even what she thinks of Prince Charles. The late Princess Diana, or Paul Burrell?- virtually nothing good about them here. <br />Even if you are yourself a Camilla fan I think your money could be better spent elsewhere if you have the earlier books. What little new information is probably already in something like Majesty Magazine, not much point in buying it twice. I was disappointed in how little new material there was here, didn't expect \\"I love Diana\\" but I did hope to actually learn something new.	2005-07-22

Basically the set up is a page of notes on each of the fairy types, followed by a full page picture of each one. I enjoyed reading the notes but found the pictures to be a very mixed lot.  <br />Some of them, the dominant color was overpowering, and in some it was very hard for me to even find the fairy in the picture. As one or more reviewers have noted some of the fairies have names mismatched to their locales but my favorte photos were #1 Eugenie, #8 Willow (I think I saw her in it), and #12 Laurel. I think, not sure, that #16 Cedahlia is also on the front and back of the book jacket- I like the front picture better than the one in the book.	2005-07-19

You'll find charts and diagrams for planting, watering,plant support, just about anything. <br />There are even recipes and other tips for some of the things you might find yourself growing. About the only thing I could really find to complain about is the lack of any sort of watermelon information, muskmelons/ cantalopes were mentioned- why not some variety of watermelon?	2005-07-19

I bought the hardcover edition because I had the idea that it would be a little more durable, it's coatpocket sized but be sure your pocket is well made, this little book is heavy(seems to be put together better than I'd expect for a paperback too). <br />The first 82 pages cover the area in general with sections on history, plant biology, wildlife and insects, and a short bit on Human life there too. Most of the pictures in the book are found in this first part. <br />The bulk of the book covers the various prairies in the U.S. and Canada with a chapter on each state or province (one small map for each). You'll get a short history/description of each major prairie as well as information on some of the plant and animal life to be found there. Directions are given for finding each place. Information on best times to visit, hiking/camping, weather and a phone number or two for more information are also given. In addition to the main prairies, at the end of each chapter there's a listing of, I guess, lesser prairies with not much more than phone numbers, a very short description and directions.  <br />I would have liked more pictures of the individual prairies to get a better idea of what each one looks like, plant, bird, animal and insect pictures would've been nice too. There's so much information/territory covered here that your eyes can almost glaze over from looking at it. It might be enough to help you decide which one to go to on vacation but if you want more detail on a specific location you'll need to go elsewhere. There are 5 websites on page 496 that I haven't tried, they might be of some help.	2005-07-15

Books	4	13	14	N	N	Great book, would go well with DVD sets if they ever get put out	A wealth of information on all 6 seasons of Hogan's Heroes. You get a short description of each episode, broadcast dates (even the original times and competing TV shows),guest appearances, even some trivial bits- all worth reading. <br />Around half the book (first half) covers the stars themselves giving details about their lives and careers, even listing TV, Movie and other credits for them. This part also has stuff on the writers/producers and the development of the series. I found this to have a lot of fascinating stuff in it. Robert Hogan, Bob Crane's character,was created by Bernard Fein who took the name of a friend- actor Robert Hogan ( you may notice his name listed in a season one episode, the actor played a POW deciding to escape on his own, messing up Hogan's planned group escape). I was surprised to read how many of the cast were actually Jewish (they took some flak for it when the show came on too). I'd heard that the show is now popular in Germany, it's explained here that the translators have basically written their own scripts to go with the pictures- so to me it isn't really even the same program anymore. One of the few complaints I have about this book is age related, written in 1998 a few more of the cast members have died since it was written. <br />You won't get many nuts & bolts details of each episode but you will get a very nice guide to the series. It's well worth owning, especially if someone ever gets around to producing more DVD sets than just the present 1st season.	2005-07-14

Sturges tells something of how he got into photography and also tells a little about some of the photographs and the good times he's had with the people. Some of his subjects tell of their history with him, that's just as interesting. Misty Dawn, 26 at the time of the book's writing, had been a subject for 23 years- she says if she ever has children it will be wonderful for them as well. Misty was specifically requested for a fashion shoot Sturges did once, she must be one of his most popular subjects. <br />It seems to be common among Sturges' models (not all nude, some are male) to enjoy their posing for his work, you can see it in their eyes even in the test shots that Sturges shows here. These are either Polaroids or digital shots, some of them taken when the gang was all just fooling around- Sturges admits that in some cases he can't even remember who actually took some of them. Even most of these pictures are artworthy. <br />Just about the only thing I can find to complain about is that the book has no paper jacket that can be put into one of those plastic library sleeves. The book cover itself has pictures on it which makes it hard to keep such a nice book in good condition. <br />Beautiful work here, well worth owning- if you know Sturges work you won't regret getting this one, it might even be a good choice for a first time Sturges buyer.	2005-07-13

There's stuff on casting bullets and loading cartridges, shooting advice, some on equipment.

If it follows that book in form and layout it will be an exhaustive guide to the first two seasons of Roswell, giving details most people would never think to look for. It should be well worth owning, especially with the DVD sets out for purchase now.  <br />I'm guessing that the only real fault to be found in the book is the lack of the 3rd season, if Topping hasn't done an update in the three years since the show ended I doubt he will do one. It ought to be a better book than \\"Crash Into Me\\" by Robyn Burnett (the exception being that one does cover third season).	2005-07-11

I found it interesting that Mr. Matthews believes that modern blackpowder isn't as good as the old time stuff was sometimes known to be. <br />It doesn't do much brand this or brand that but gives a sort of autobiographical account of the author's years of experiences and things that have worked for him. As examples, you'll get whole chapters on casting the bullet, the powder charge, lubricating the bullet, loading the cartidge. <br />I think it might just be enough to give a novice an idea of whether or not this is something they want to get into. For the person who really does want into the field I'd think you might want more details on equipment but it is still a worthwhile book to own.	2005-07-11

Mr. Matthews does touch on that briefly, descibing his first reproduction from Navy Arms (it needed a lot of work done on it to shoot it's best)and a later rifle that he had custom built. The old stuff is what I wanted, I'd have given the book another star if there had been more there.	2005-06-28

Over time he managed to see her more and more, became well known to the Princess and became a friend of hers. He often brought her flowers, that's the title part, but sometimes other gifts, and describes this as well as some of the many times he met Diana. I thought it was an interesting little book, chatty but different, lots of pictures almost all taken by Mr. Jackman. <br />I think when I ordered the CD-ROM it was more available than the paperback, now the reverse is true, I'd rather have it in paperform. Amazon doesn't give any PC requirements, which made me nervous, but I was relieved to find that it is Macintosh, Windows or Unix compatible- you also need a sound card (for a song on the disc- I didn't listen to it)and a Java-enabled browser. I put the thing in my CD-ROM drive and it started right up,didn't install anything that I saw, no problems. I use America Online, that started up like I was going to be put online but it just opened the book up,easy to operate when you get it there.

There is quite a bit of science in his writing, but it isn't too complicated, and a lot of opinion too. Manning does favor the use, in some cases, of chemicals to battle foreign plant species. He doesn't have much use for modern grain farming (not suited to the normal moisture patterns or maybe even the terrain) and considers beef cattle far too destructive for the land (he describes some of the effects the herds have had on the land- and what the buffalo(he favors hunting them but not to extinction) were like). He mentioned that while the old free range cattle ranching was harder on the environment that the buffalo herds (I think he advocated returning them) at least it was better than the current fenced in, likely to overgraze system. <br />I especially appreciated the details of how the buffalo herds were hunted down in the 19th century. <br />If the science is even half right (I feel that it probably is) something needs to be done to restore things in the Plains. I know that I've read in agricultural magazines that the west is experiencing a severe, and growing, groundwater shortage. You won't get the country to admit it ( he writes about the special interests) but so much of the land out there isn't suited for anything past what nature was doing with it we need to work with nature, not against it. <br />Anyone interested in the western grasslands and/ or the buffalo should consider getting a copy of this book.	2005-06-14

Each has several subcategories for bits of information you might want such as who directed or guest starred, trivia, highlights, mistakes. It can be a little too extensive at times- I had to read through more than once to find a bit I was looking for. <br />If you're a fan of Alias, epsecially if you have the DVD sets, you should get this book.	2005-06-11

From my reading I've read that the Sharps came in several calibers and barrel lengths and most hunters tried to get close in for their shots. Other than that even this page was good. <br />There's a map showing you where to find public viewing herds but it has only the vaguest of directions on how to get to them, no addresses, phone numbers or websites. <br />Short, a little bit pricey, but you will learn a little something.	2005-06-11

They are actually running out of water and losing population. <br />There are a lot of pages about their travels, speaking engagements with often hostile crowds,hostile press (not all western) and some sections dealing with the science of what is happening to the land out there. You also get a fair amount of history, some people always saw the Plains as land that shouldn't be developed as eastern land had been (it wasn't suitable for such useage).  <br />I'd have liked more science and more detail on the Buffalo commons concept, it's an interesting idea but I don't see it becoming a national policy. The new forward and afterword deal with changes in the situation since the original publication but don't convince me that it has much chance of really happening.	2005-06-09

There's a lot of stuff here in this little (I hadn't paid attention to the dimensions Amazon lists) guide but most of it is repeated in Toppings Complete Slayer book, usually in even greater detail. <br />I thought the little several page sumary of all seven years was interesting, maybe even as good as reading the episode notes in teh DVD sets would be. I didn't mind the different trivia sections, lots of things in them, but in this book Topping just lists things as occuring in an episode by the show title- in The Complete Slayer he also lists the episode number (which I particularly liked as I don't remember most episodes by title and need more help in finding them). <br />The most interesting facts I read here, but don't remember from his Ultimate guide, concerned Gile's home in England (seen in early 7th season)- apparently that is Anthony Stewart Head's real home, the other fact was a \\"you might also have seen me in\\" trivia bit about the actress who played Marcy the invisible girl in 1st season. I don't remember ever seeing her picture in the episode itself but this bit tells of a movie she's appeared in. <br />The book is a fun little read but for only a couple of dollars more get Topping's Complete Slayer, it is a much better value.	2005-05-05

You'll get information about herd ranges- past & present, current population estimates (and worries about the future of the herd, and scholars best guesses about what historical numbers might have been.  <br />Dr. Lott writes extensively about behavior of the bison, some of this comes from 3 generations of personal family experience and includes items I hadn't read or heard of before. You'll even find extensive material about plant and other animal life that live with these animals and how many of them are interrelated. <br />He even covers the human/hunting aspects and their effects on what the bison was/is. Someone out to hunt buffalo might get some hints but the book isn't aimed at them. <br />If you've ever seen a buffalo you'll want this book, you really ought to consider it even if you don't ever plan on looking them up (That is the skimpiest part of the book, finding out just where the remaining bison herds are today). <br />I gave $40 for the hardcover, I think the paperback is $11.95, not cheap but a pretty good value for one of the best bison books I've got.	2005-04-08

You'll find original US & UK broadcast dates, episode cast lists,music, descriptions and quotes for each episode as well as a lot of interesting trivia bits. That last part surprised me because this isn't even Topping's Slayer trivia book. The man obviously loved the show, there's so much here (I guess he got it right, I do remember a little item or two that aren't mentioned in this book)the problem is that, at 702 pages, it may be a little hard to get into for a casual reader.	2005-03-25

In this story 12 years have passed, Davy and Millie have been married for 10 of those years. He's still freelancing for the NSA while she's now a psychologist in Stillwater Oklahoma.   As the story opens they've had an argument of sorts, Millie wants to have kids, Davy doesn't. He \\"jumps\\" to a meeting with his NSA friend Cox leaving Millie in their Texas cave home. Millie waits for Davy to return but after a day or so determines that something must be wrong and resolves to use her emergency rope to climb down the cliff. Part way down, the rope comes loose and Millie discovers that she too can now jump, finding herself in their Oklahoma condo.  The bulk of the story development is spent switching back and forth between Davy & Millie as he learns that a sinister secret group has kidnapped him in order to use his power to further their aims (and that they've developed the means to control him)while Millie learns to use her new found ability in her search to  eventually find/rescue her husband.  I think I actually like this book a little better than Jumper. I found it to be generally well written (in one place Millie is 31, in another she's 33 and a young girl she meets seems to have been given two different names- on one page), it also strikes me that Mr. Gould might be thinking of the possiblity of a sequel the way things are resolved by books end.  Jumper & it's sequel Reflex are both worth owning.	2005-03-16

It's 128 pages long, many of them full page photos (which no doubt cut down the number of possible information pages)and is divided into several sections. Much of the book is done from a sort of American Indian perspective telling of their traditions and uses, conflicts with the white man. Later on you get some stuff on the buffalo hunting period, that's also interesting if not entirely error free (in one place the dates are given as 1934 and 1947, that should be 18, not 19. They also call buffalo rifles .50 caliber when one photo clearly shows mention of other calibers). <br />Apparently a huge number of animals were killed even in the early pre- 1870's years. <br />The last part of the book tells of efforts to save the remainders of the great herds and how that's worked out as well as hopes for the future. <br />I'd liked to have had much more information (there are notes & a reading list at books end)but did really appreciate the large selection of photographs, most of them modern but some historical, that included not only the buffalo but some of the things made from or related to them. This is the real reason to buy the book.	2005-03-16

Although he had minimal experience in Buffalo Hunting or Ranching himself Mr. Biggers in the passage of time met up with ranchers and old retired Buffalo hunters and managed to get them to tell their stories. Since many of them wouldn't just come out and tell their tales he often had to get them talking and gradually work around to the material and quotes the men anonymously. Originally written as two books a little over 100 years ago part one, \\"Pictures of the Past\\", deals with the Buffalo hunting period in Texas running from around 1870 to 1880 or so. Several sections here telling various aspects but not a lot of information, around half of the section doesn't really even concern buffalo. You'll get a little about how they hunted, I think there's more about the other types of game encountered. I read a little about how the trade in hides got started, hide hauling, bone hauling when the herds were gone (bones were used as a form of fertilizer). The most interesting parts were the account of two distinctly different subtypes of buffalo herds- they traveled together but in separate herds, and the changes such as the disappearance of large numbers of turkeys. One item I hadn't read before was the contention that the professional hunters (several hundred of them by Biggers estimation)had a low opinion of \\"amateur\\" hunters, didn't want them around. The photos, very interesting, included in this section were taken on an actual Texas buffalo hunt in the 1870's- I don't think Biggers ever had them in his editions of the book.    Part two, \\"History that will never be repeated\\", tells of the development of ranching in west Texas from about the late 1860's to 1900 or so. It's even longer than the first sub-book but in similar format telling of boom and bust periods, different methods of grazing and cattle types, acually a little more informative than the first part. There were a couple of sections that seemed to consist either of a list of ranches or of men who'd had ranches that aren't worth much to today's reader, a few buffalo bits and some details of pretty significant environmental changes. The photographs included here were of Texas ranching, I think from 1906-08.  If you want a book about old time buffalo hunting this isn't it, may not be the one for old ranching either. I didn't get the amount of information I was looking for and consider the paperback, it's a nice one, to be a much better value than the hardcover edition- you won't be using it for reference very much.	2005-03-13

It tells a little of his Civil War experiences but spends most of the time telling about his buffalo hunting days, mostly down in Texas. I found it to be long winded, sometimes patronizing, but interesting. You will find that he used terms for Blacks, Indians and Mexicans that would get a person in a lot of trouble today but it seems to me that the man generally got along with the races. <br />The man must've kept some sort of diary the way he recited details 30 years after the fact. I just wish he'd gone into more detail, the numbers/ details quoted do go along with things I've read from other sources. Apparently it wasn't felt necessary to go into fine detail since most readers either had personal experince or knew of those who had but I found myself wanting to know more about weapons, skinning and selling hides and the general details of life as a buffalo hunter. <br />The book is worth owning if you're interested in the Buffalo hunting period of American History but you'll find yourself wanting more information than is presented here.	2005-03-06

Drugs and dosages for each subject are listed (most of this stuff the private citizen can't get ahold of anywhere, some of it would be hard for most Doctors to find.), some of it is administered by injection, some orally and some by intravenous drip. <br />There are pretty extensive reference lists at the end of each chapter (John Q.

This is followed by a short color section of photos, most from the episode itself. <br />The last section of the book is I guess a complete selection of the sheet music, not of much interest to me. <br />I did find the book interesting but I much prefer watching \\"Once more with Feeling\\", or listening to it, than reading about it.	2005-02-27

As the description says this is a review of 25 years of Jock Sturges work. Anyone who has seen Mr. Sturges photographs or his books will find photos of several of his subjects taken over the years- Fanny, Misty Dawn, Vanessa- they're all here.   Most of the pictures were beautiful although a few did strike me almost as snapshots, even those showed the photographer's skill. I liked the way he told a little something about each one in the accompanying caption. You'll learn something about the subjects in each one that isn't usually found in other Sturges books.  At $50 the price is somewhat expensive but at least you're buying some great photographic art. I wish I'd bought my copy here at Amazon, my source charged me $7.39 for shipping, no cost shipping is available here. Any serious Jock Sturges collector ought to buy this one.	2005-01-28

His time lag is so bad that he doesn't realize for some time that he had a mission to restore the time line. Supposedly objects cannot be brought foward in time (although Kivrin Engle returned to 2055 wearing 1348 clothing in Doomsday Book)but another historian has done just that, bringing a living cat that belonged to Lady Schrapnel's multiple greatgrandmother ( whose diary was the inspiration for the reborn Coventry). <br />The bulk of the book follows the adventures of Ned and Verity Kindle (the other historian)as they live in the past with that ancestor's family  trying to reset history to it's proper order. I don't see the humor that some reviews and the book cover mention but I found it to be a great book anyway filled with lots of detail and interesting points. <br />The Victorians were cartoonish but I've read similar depictions in the past. I loved getting more details about how time travel \\"works\\" and the history of it's development but had trouble follwing the self correcting continuum bit. Nice idea about the restoration of lost things idea that Mr. Dunsworthy, yes he's back too, and others develop as a result of the cat coming forward. <br />I've gotten all three of Ms. Willis' time travel stories now (I understand that she'swriting another one), no regrets on any of them.	2005-01-19

I was afraid that it would be hard to keep track of which Dirk was which but the authors did a good job of lining things out (Jr. was Dirk & Sr. was Pitt)and the story has all of the features the series has had in the past. <br />Black Wind starts out with a Japanese Submarine heading out on a mission to the U.S. in late 1944 and being sunk just before it could achieve it's goal. Flash forward to 2007 (all of the Pitt stories have been set slightly into the future)some mysterious something is killing people,fish, and seals in Alaska. Dirk Jr. rescues a lovely lady scientist just like Dad always did. The plot goes on, eventually revealing an evil plan by North Korea to cause a forced reuninfication with South Korea by way of using recovered Japanese bioweapons (from the sunken submarine and it's also sunken sister ship) on the U.S. Both Pitts do their part to save the day. <br />As in all Pitt stories you have a car chase, Pitt's car (Pitt Jr. in this case) gets shot up and a lot of action. <br />I don't know who wrote what in this book but if you like Cussler's books this one won't go too far wrong. Both Male Pitts have plenty of scenes (Dad had parts of maybe 100, and was mentioned in a couple of dozen more), Summer Pitt didn't make an appearance until page 183 but was pretty steady from there on out. Clive Cussler himself even appears in one section as he's done for the last few books now. There's no ancient civilization, not much over advanced technology (maybe a minsub or something)just good typical afternoon fun.	2005-01-07
US	51737389	R16M936O36ODMD	1880510197	22664892	The Buffalo Hunters	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Very informative , would like more information, pictures	I got a copy of this book in an effort to learn more about the buffalo hunting era. This book makes frequent references to/ quotes of period works about the subject and does manage to give some interesting details that would be hard to find elsewhere in current literature.  <br />I knew that the .45/70 caliber was at one point the most common rifle used, this book states that the U.S. Army issued free ammunition to the hunters as part of their Indian control/buffalo eradication program. While I don't doubt the author's statement about .50 caliber rifles being common, I've read that before, I do question the prices said to have been paid for them by the hunters- if they're right the local gun dealers made a huge markup from factory list prices. <br />The part I found most interesting was the history of how and when the hunting began, the reasons for the market and the prices given for the hides. There are various bits from several hunters about the hunting they did as well. I've read just a very little about the incredible number of buffalo killed, that is detailed in several places in the book, kind of shocking to modern sensiblities(and to some contemporaries as well, their efforts to stop/limit the hunt are described). I was not aware that Texas was the main killing ground, Montana was late in the game. <br />Numerous period illustrations of the hunt and quite a few old photographs too. Several hunter's pictures are shown (these were generally taken many years later), one of these photo's is \\"thought to be\\" Jim White- one of the best hunters of the Plains, Frank Sellers book \\"Sharps Firearms\\" p. 304 gives a different name with better attribution. The most historically valuable photographs were taken either by George Robertson in Texas in 1874 or L.A. Huffman in Montana in the early 1880's, these show actual hunts- too bad they printed so dark in the book it's hard to pick out detail.	2004-12-29

That was interesting but was done in a very choppy style as if Mr, Rywell had made some notes and never got around to really polishing them up. <br />The bulk of the book consists of, for the most part anyway, copies of various reports, testimonials,price lists, extracts from company catalogs (& numerous illustrations from same), even some patent applications. It's somewhat jumbled together, not always arranged by date- often in very small print. I found the information presented to be very interesting, even worth owning to the collector of original or replica Sharps rifles but hard to read in part because of the print size.	2004-12-22

Mr. Jephson's first book \\"Shadows of a Princess\\" was alternately praising of the Princess and then would tear her down so I was a bit wary of this book.<br /><br />I think it takes a nicer tone about the Princess this time, describing trips she made to various countries (each with it's own chapter) with Jephson in tow. For your money I find that you'll be getting what amounts to a medium sized picture book with large print text. Kent Gavin's long introduction is actually the best, most informative part of the text, Jephson puts too much of himself in his writing. The pictures, well you've seen most of them before, they're still good anyway.<br /><br />There are a couple of chapters at the end by other writers about traveling with Diana, also better than what Jephson himself wrote.<br /><br />It isn't the worst book to own but I'd still prefer Rosalind Coward's book.	2004-12-05

This time around all 8 stories are set around the Cruciamentum which all slayers are put through on reaching 18.  <br />I found that these writers (some of whom also wrote for the series) each had their own style and usually didn't tell their Cruciamentum stories anything like what we saw Buffy go through in the TV version, in some the girl's parents even knew she was a slayer. I haven't read the whole book yet but found, as before, stories running through the centuries- from Nikki in 1973 back to Esperanza in 1481. I didn't care for the beatnik story but thought the Spanish Inquisition story was interesting. I kind of liked Survivors and Sideshow Slayer. Jane Espenson's \\"Two teenage girls at the Mall\\" was one of the more interesting stories, and told mostly from the viewpoint of the vampire girl.	2004-12-05

This is one of the best books written about the late Princess that I've ever seen.  <br />Early on in the book there's a list of people who contributed to it, (quotations mostly), celebrities & common people too. Not too many surprises- I didn't expect to see the Fayed family represented, (they are mentioned in 2 or 3 quotes)but I was surprised to see Andrew Morton, Ken Wharfe, and Patrick Jephson because they'd all been not the most flattering in her name. Morton is the most extensively quoted, makes himself sound better than what I remember history showing. Paul Burrell gets not a whisper (unless someone mentoned him in their own bits)but then that's probably because he & the Spencer family don't get along these days. <br />There are also copies of several different drafts of Charles Spencer's famous eulogy and I think even a couple of variations of Elton John's \\"Candle in the Wind\\". <br />The main part of the book covers the various stages of Diana's life from birth onwards to the aftermath since her death, lots of material here with a lot of detail, some of it I think might even be new material. You'll find almost no Royal/ Charles bashing and only a hint of Diana's troubles beyond the mention that her marriage wasn't always happy and the eating disorders (most of what you do get of that relates it to her work in life).  <br />I found it fascinating to read about the charity things she did and the work that they've done since then, the funeral items were also of interest & mostly different from what I've read before. The pictures were mostly things we've all seen before, you won't want to buy this book for them alone, but as Tim Graham is quoted, \\"She was very easy to photograph. You had to be a pretty useless photographer if you didn't get a good picture of her.\\" The last little section of the book is about six of the people who've been helped by the memorial fund since the Princess died, it quotes them on how the fund has changed their lives. <br />Really, theonly complaints I have about this book are it's large size, it's a real handful, and the white dust jacket which will certainly get dirty if you handle it much (you'll want to find one of those plastic library book covers to protect it). Very worthwhile book, well worth owning.	2004-11-18
US	51737389	R1D68RFYGTS6CS	0786007001	731788678	The Murder of Princess Diana	Books	2	59	67	N	N	Very interesting but flawed book, could've been much better	I was very sceptical of the quality of this book when I first heard of it, my reading of it has confirmed my feelings.<br /><br />Mr. Botham spends 288 pages going over the events of the Princess' life and death and how it must've been, in his view, murder.<br /><br />He has an extensive bibliography but no footnotes to tell you who, or which book, provided each bit of information. Any serious collector of Royalty/ Diana books will recoginze many titles, some of them not at all friendly to the late princess. I also found irritating the extent to which senior officials, well placed sources, and all sorts of others all anonymously confided in the author- this amounted to a large portion of the story at times.<br /><br />To save time you can pretty much skip reading pages 30-152 as there is nothing new in the section titled \\"The Marriage\\", just a lot of recycled Charles and Diana bashing, sure to offend many. Botham even brought up the old Prince Harry fathered by Hewitt story, claiming to have seen in Hewitt's home, in his bedroom (p.80), there is only one picture displayed- of Prince Harry. He implies that this must mean the rumors are true although even James Hewitt himself denies the possiblity.<br /><br />As for the rest of the book, unfortunately largely supported by those anonymous tipsters and no documentation, there is a lot of very interesting stuff about how the CIA, MI6, French agencies had to have had something to do with her death and how/why they would've pulled it off. It's all very interesting reading, some of it I have read/ heard before (including the Prince Charles had a hand in it bit) and even at least somewhat plausible given that some of these people are known to have attempted such things at times. I didn't care for the way Botham uncritically accepts the pregnancy legend as fact or the way he'd alternately use Mohamed Al Fayed as evidence or brand him as a liar, all to prove whatever point he wanted to make at that time. I really didn't like the way he claims that Diana's friend Rosa Monckton might even have been an MI6 agent secretly out to get something on her. For that one to be true the lady must still be undercover, acting as Diana's friend, what would be the use in that?<br /><br />Large parts of the details of the official investigation (or lack of one) are true, or at least likely. Entirely too much of the rest of the book could be- it's just that there's so much unsupported hearsay that bothers me.at Diana's friend Rosa Monckton might even have been an MI6 agent secretly out to get something on her.

I haven't read much of the book (my mother had it and I've bought a copy as a gift)but I see that the author's mention a real hospital or two in southwest Missouri as well as a couple of real towns (I don't think there is really a Knoll but there is a town called Noel).   I'm curious as to which real hospital the Doctor works at, it would be interesting to know if the difficult patient/ Doctor plots are in any way based in reality. I think the Christian faith is a constant theme throughout but it is handled well, no fraud ministers, not pushy in display of faith.	2004-10-17

I don't see anything as being particularly political, no party or president is favored- George W. Bush isn't mentioned at all.  <br />I've already heard that Mr. Kerry has a reputation of saying/ doing whatever will get the most votes, this goes back to the start of his Viet Nam days and describes just what he was up to politically even then.  <br />Apparently Mr. Kerry had a habit of exaggeration, distortion, even lying, lots of footnotes and sources in the book to back up these charges. Several examples are given, along with his changing story of what happened. I thought I'd heard a little about 2 tours of duty in Viet Nam, this book shows that the 1st tour was aboard a ship & all but 5 weeks or so of that was off the coast of California and the 5 weeks was no big danger either. The second tour lasted only 4 months not because of wounds (Kerry says)but because the other soldiers couldn't stand him and wanted him out. As for Mr. Kerry's Purple Hearts, he could prove his story by releasing all of his military records (which he refuses to do). As detailed here one medal was for a tiny metal fragment in a finger( how it got there depends on whose story you want to believe), the medics wondered why he even came in with it, another medal (varying Kerry accounts on it) was for shell fragments this book says he actually got his backside peppered with rice grains from throwing a grenade to destroy a captured Viet Cong food supply and was too close to the explosion. <br />The book was apparently written in the span of a few short months, the style reflects that, but seems to be very well documented which may have taken a much longer time. I think Mr. Kerry is a case of someone who based on Viet Nam alone, never mind the last 30 years, should never be permitted near the White House, even if this book is only half true.	2004-10-13

For your money you get a total of 13 portraits (including the front cover) of the Princess. Some of these portraits are studio shots, some were taken during various tours- one is even of the Princess visiting with a little girl. <br />Most of the pictures are very good- Tim Graham is qouted in the book as saying a photographer would be pretty useless if they didn't get a good photograph of her but one shot, December, does have some sun glare across her face.  <br />While I do like the calendar I did find that the book did have some studio shots- not used here- that would've made a fantastic calendar, I guess somebody was just trying for variety.	2004-10-13

It's been years since I read the last of Morton's Diana books and this one does have some new material. What were the first ones called? Her True Story & Her New Life? This one tells how it all came about in the first place and is the first time I've read so many of the details. You do not get a lot of the stuff that was printed in the other books, nor in that updated version he rushed out almost before the funeral (he doesn't bother to talk about that)but you will learn more about what happened at the time. This is the first time I've read much about James Colthurst and hs involvement, he's mentioned in quotes but not recent ones.   The worst thing I found in the book was the way Morton seems to promote himself as Diana's protector/ helper, even claiming (with Colthurst) to have advised her on things, and helping write some speeches. He never even hints that he might have any responsibility for the difficulties \\"Her True Story\\" caused the Princess when it came out. He gets mean about Martin Bashir and the infamous Panorama interview and starts out belittling Paul Burrell's role in Diana's life then gets vicious (especially about his book and post royal life) as he goes on. Somehow I don't think Paul Burrell deserves a lot of what Morton dishes out and feel it reflects a feeling of \\"Diana is my story , I'm the man to tell it, no one else can do so well\\". If he'd left the rip Burrell stuff out and, maybe, shown the Princess a little more respect himself I'd give this book another star, it is a good book.	2004-09-20

The storyline is set centuries after Buffy and is the story of a young slayer who is more like the Faith we know than Buffy.<BR>I found the setting to be depressing, if that is the future it's sure going to be miserable, but the artwork is great- and the story isn't too bad either.	2004-06-05

This is followed by cast biographies &amp; pictures (this part is now getting just a little out of date), chapters 3-7 consist of things about the fans, conventions/ charity work inspired by the show, a few websites (one of which identifies film locations)&amp; trivia stuff-and quite a few pictures.<BR>The bulk of the book is an episode guide for all three seasons, complete with air dates cast ,guest cast, episode synopsis and various little sections on different aspects of each episode. I liked the fact that the author would often put in a little criticism of script flaws and I especially liked the way some episodes were identified as having mistakes (a couple of episodes have film crew members at least partially visible).<BR>I liked having a listing for the music on each episode but this may not be of much use to DVD owners as some of the music will be changed from the broadcast version of the show.<BR>My main gripe is that I would've liked more information (some of the stuff here was obviously written during the shows run but not reedited)but this book will certainly get you by.	2004-05-09

You get a good amount of facts &amp; figures, a lot of photographs and other illustrations. <BR>There is actually too much for one book. I found myself wanting more information on the 1874 model Sharps (the type used in the movie Quigley Down Under)and while there is a great deal it managed to not cover everything I wanted. This is most likely because in his preface Mr. Sellers writes that he originally came up with a 1500 page manuscript that had everything in it. Obviously to get it down to a publishable 358 pages a lot had to be cut out but you will get information on design, development, models, types &amp; variations. There is also a lot of stuff on accessories, even the types of finishes that the rifles and other guns could be purchased with.<BR>Anyone who owns or wants to own a Sharps should have this book as should anyone interested in the history of American firearms.<BR>Although listed as out of print I have a copy that came out in 2003, it might not look as nice as some of the earlier editions but has the same information. If you can't find an old one (same price as new I think), try one of the major shooting supplies websites, or try Shiloh Rifle itself.	2004-02-15

This one has four longer stories (and four experienced non-TV Buffy writers) instead of many like the first two books did, that may be part of the problem in that if I didn't like a story as well it took so much longer to get through it.<BR>#1 Dark of the Moon was interesting although I think I might've liked #2 Ch'ing Shih better, more like the Buffy TV stuff even though it is set in 1856. <br />I haven't gotten through #3 Voodoo Lounge yet, not sure what I think of it. <BR>#4 The Code of the Samurai is set in Tokyo December 1993, just before Buffy. The Slayer here is an American girl whose Naval Officer father has just been stationed in Japan, she makes some friends and together they wipe out a band of centuries old Vampire Samurai. That one was written well enough but I just didn't like it.<BR>If there is a fourth volume I hope they get back to the mini story concept and get some show writer contributions.	2004-01-28

No real secrets given about the Princess, most of the rumors left out or just hinted at, some are given what might be described as insider explanations. Certainly nothing treasonous to Diana or other Royals.<BR>I would venture to say that Mr. Burrell favors the Princess over Prince Charles but think that he treats both of them fairly. He does seem to have no use for the Spencer family or Scotland Yard but that is natural as they tried to hang him in his theft trial. A much better book than his critics have claimed, well worth owning.	2003-12-12

This one is somewhat different from the others in that the adult son &amp; daughter that Pitt learned he had in the last page or two of Valhalla Rising are now working at NUMA. <BR>The book starts with what has become Cussler's formula of some great event occuring at some point in the past and then moving forward to the present day,in this case Aug-Nov 2006. A super hurricane is about to wipe out some fantastic floating hotel when Dirk Sr. and Al Giordino arrive to save the day,kind of a wasted story element as it is only lightly linked to the rest of the book (D.Sr. &amp; Al don't even appear until chapter 8 by the way).<BR>The rest of the novel switches back and forth between Pitt's children and the older generation, sometimes together but more often not. You'll find the usual mix of a great old car or two, narrow escapes and explosions tempered by Pitt (you'll almost need a score card to keep track of which Dirk you're reading about, Sr. is usually referred to as Pitt, Jr. as Dirk) and Al referring to the years getting to them. <BR>The stories have been going on for almost 25 years now and it seemed to me that at times Cussler was ignoring past story plot lines although many times he'd put something in about a lot of the past adventures. A couple of times there was a problem with the timeline - Valhalla was set in 2003 but Trojan Odyssey, set only 2 years later, is set in 2006. Another time warp occurs when a man is sacrificed by the evil Druid group, the way subsequent events regarding the man's holdings are related far to much time goes by to fit into the general storyline.<BR>In the end all ends well with Pitt marrying longtime love Congresswoman Loren Smith, and it looks like he and Al will have job promotions at Numa. Cussler himself makes his usual appearance in the story but this time only in the last page or so.<BR>Mr. Cussler may be planning to retire, I kind of wonder from the tone of this book. I wonder if someone else will write some Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer Pitt novels, perhaps Paul Kemprecos whose Kurt Austin &amp; Joe Zavala characters are very briefly in this book.	2003-12-08

You get the history of the place from it's beginnings (there's been something built on the site for about a 1000 years) but mostly covering the period from the 17th century onwards through today.<BR>There are a lot of photographs of various sections of the building complex, some more than 100 years old,both inside and out as well as maps and diagrams from past centuries. <BR>The history of the place is very detailed with period illustrations and covers many of the occupants as well as the structure itself.<BR>I really like the book and would recommend it to anyone who has been or is thinking of going to London. You will learn a lot about the Palace but be warned, this isn't a guide book. You will learn about a lot of what is there but you aren't told just what isn't open to the public (if you are it isn't very clear and I missed it)and there is no Prince(or Princess)lived here detail (Charles &amp; Diana barely mentioned in comparison to some past inhabitants).	2003-11-16

This time she visits the 5th and 6th seasons giving you a picture and quote from each episode and a paragraph about each. You are also informed of the guest cast and writer/directors and several paragraphs about each episode, this is actually the most informative part about each story. <BR>I thought the charactor/ actor profiles at the end of this edition were very interesting (some very nice photos too)as were the chapters about various aspects of producing the series. It's a good bok ofr a fan of the series to own but if you're new to StarGate you'll be sort of lost as it assumes you know what's going on.	2003-11-16

Each of the episode pages (some run 2 pages)will have a guest cast list, an episode photo, character quotes and a paragraph about the episode. Usually the best part of each page will be several following paragraphs about that particular episode with anectdotes given by various cast &amp; crew.<BR>The final chapters of the book contain actor profiles (each actor spoke with the author), character quotes and pictures. There are also sections on costume/set design, location work and a fan bit at the end. It's a lot of fun but not really informative if you want detailed information.	2003-11-16

This book has an amazing variety of melons but I fond it to be rather light on the amount of information provided to the inexperienced new grower.<BR>You get several pages of tips on growing and harvesting (I don't think it's quite detailed enough for the novice), a page on saving seeds, two on hand pollination (these were interesting), and a couple of pages of recipes to use your harvest in.<BR>The main part of the book is sort of art book like to me with a few pages of type histries and several pages of artistic photos of various melons. Each of the melon pictures is identified as figure#1-100, you'll find a corresponding section in the back of the book giving info on size, weight and so on. At the end of the book there's a source listing for places to get the seeds of some, not all, of what is shown in the book.	2003-11-04

I missed most of the series on PBS, but what I saw looked very good, much better than the earlier 1900 House. This book is the companion to the TV program and is really better suited to those who have seen it as I found some parts a little confusing due to not having watched most of it.<br />The book gives a good background on the house itself but is skimpy on the program, reads almost like it is about a real Edwardian family, no details on family selection or what happened after their stay was over.<br />All of the photographs are very good, the little extra sections on the cast I found interesting (likely would've been better if I'd actually seen the show), the side bits on foods and other items were even interesting.<br />I did notice that, as in 1900 House, the experts setting up made a surprising blunder, here they forgot to check the possibility that a decades unused chimney might be blocked (which it was). Another thing I found little mention of was the Silver stair railing (does the show mention it?), something so unusal and only a couple of photo captions about it.<br />Not enough to be a time travelers textbook but a very good companion to the series.	2003-11-04

This book is no different, he spends lots of time rambling on about her good works and skills and then will rip into the Princess for a variety of things. <BR>I find the title &quot;Diana, Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; to be interesting becasue Davies seems to imply that most of the secrets and lies in the story were Diana's although he often rambles off about some other members of the royal family.<BR>One of the most outrageous things in the book is Davies virtual, near continuous insistence that Prince Harry is James Hewitt's son. He even has the nerve to quote Hewitt denying this 'fact', something I personally don't believe that lowlife would do, he'd want the attention.<BR>The first two reviewers liked the Diana murder conspiracy segment, it is interesting but not very well developed, I'd like more on that one.<BR>Ingrid Seward for all her faults is a much better writer, getting her books instead might prove to be the better investment.	2003-09-27

Near the end of Patriot Games, written in '87 but set in about '82 or '83, Jack Ryan jr. was born- he's now 23 and a recent college graduate which would make the story set in 2006 or so yet the war in Iraq (I thought Clancy met the real one, not his fictional Gulf War)is characterized as recent. Sometimes refered to as Jack, sometimes as Ryan or even Junior by the author our hero has determined that a financial business is really a front for an inteligence operation and he talks his way into a job during a meeting with the boss (a former senator who knew his father, the now retired president Ryan).<br />I didn't mind the totally off the books covert intelligence unit (only the ex- president and a few others even know it exists)but you get a story that isn't really well developed. The Campus has existed for just over a year hacking into CIA and everyone else's computers and communications tracking down various bad guys and their financing. About this time the bunch decides to move into full operation by recruiting a couple of twin brothers solely on the strength of the Marine brother having killed a few guerilla fighters in Afghanistan and the FBI brother administering a little on the spot justice to ONE child rapist/ murderer. I wasn't really clear about how they were selected, didnt like the way their superiors were unsure how good these two would be until they performmed a hit or two and I really didn't like the way they just happened to be Ryan jr's cousins ( the exact relation was never explained, I didn't know either Jack Sr. or Cathy Ryan had siblings, and what family history you do get is weak)<br />The best part of the book (if you can call it that)is the terrorist group allying itself with Columbian smugglers, not really liking each other but seeing benefits in each aiding the other.

Dedicated to both those who died during the sinking and those who died September 11, 2001 (while the film project was underway)the fist chapter gives a quick but detailed history of the Titanic folowed by several chapters devoted to the crew's exploration and filming of the shipwreck and it's aftermath. <BR>I really liked the photos of the wreck as it is now, especially when compared with similar period photos, and the computer graphic reconstructions were amazing. Many of the photographs seemed very familiar, I was surprised to see so many of things that had somehow survive breaking and kind o depressed to see the signs of collapse that the wreck is now going through. <BR>I sure wish I could've seen the movie, hope it comes out on video soon and I'd like to see much more work of this type doen before it's too late.	2003-09-14

I thought that was laid on a little too thick but with a life like Harry's a person would tend to get heated up. I did notice that friends seemed to be 'mates' now, a change from previous books, and that there is a little stronger language present in the text that some parents may not want younger children to read ( a few damns and hells uttered by some characters).<BR>Overall the story is very well developed, if you like the other books this one will be very similar in tone despite it's greater length. I personally would have taken out the wizard hospital scenes because they seemed to be mostly filler (especially the Gilderoy Lockhart bit), with over 800 pages who needs that? Harry's disastrous date with Cho Chang was also not very satisfactorily handled. I didn't otherwise mind that Phoenix was 870 pages in length, any competent reader can handle it. Who would have ever dreamed of a kids book being so long, some people whine about a Tom Clancy novel just being much more than half the size.	2003-08-05

There are a couple of \\"Buffy\\" stories, one by the guy who was in charge of Makeup for the first six years of the series production,(his story is a little weak, set in fourth season, and has at least acouple of details wrong). The other is by show writer Jane Espenson, set in 6th season there is some time travel back to late third season and it is better than some of the episodes that actually were aired. I liked it about as well as any in the book.<br />I didn't care for the Pirate Slayer or the [imitation] of Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\" but I did think a lot of the story of the Slayer serving in the Union Army as a young man during the American Civil War,it gives General Sherman's destructive march through the South a much better angle.	2003-04-27

I considered the ancient Greek story as one of the best(and,at 29, the oldest slayer I've ever read of), the Virginia Dare story was also good (and is full of those historical references), the 1880's Kentucky and 1950's Florida stories also had their points.	2003-04-27

I was disappointed in what I found although it can be useful and interesting.<BR>Covering the first two seasons the guide gives each episode a single B/W photo, a guest cast list, the writer and director (and sometimes who did the teleplay). This is followed by a quote from one of the characters in each episode, a one paragraph synopsis and a paragraph or two about the episode by a cast member or someone behind the scenes. A gray box with information about a character or race in some episodes.<BR>The forward, the character profiles at the books end, and a couple of other short sections on episode production actually gave the most information. It seems obvious to me that the cast seem to like each other and generally enjoy doing the show, I just wish I'd gotten more information about how it's all done.	2003-02-24

I noticed that Ms. Gellar does seem to be the center of attention, she is after all the star of the show, but each of the main cast members does make an appearance several times. Some calendars don't give you much space to write notes on each date, this one does. My only real complaint is with the background or border colors used with the pictures, the colors can be very distracting and sometimes make the month hard to read.	2003-01-12

Many of whom you'll recognize and some you won't, I was suprised at how extensive a list of actors and others contributed readings (most under 2 minutes long, I wouldn't have thought some of them would have bothered).<BR>If the current Amazon.com offering is like the one I got in the U.K. you'll be getting a double CD with a little liner booklet full of CD listings, contributor photo's and several photo's of the Princess herself(including one on the cover). Apparently the album had the approval of the Princess of Wales memorial fund, my copy mentions it, Diana's signature (used as a logo by the Fund) is on the album and each CD.<BR>I found it too tedious to listen to myself not being a poetry fan, the album is probably best owned by poetry lovers and those who MUST have anything related to the Princess.	2003-01-05

Paladin Press books are always a little pricey for what you get, at least Amazon gives a good deal. <BR>I found that the author seems to favor adapting BDU's (military uniform shirts & pants)and poncho's by sewing a variety of materials onto them. He gives some instruction and tips on that as well as suggested lists of materials. I guess this little book is all right but I'd like it to have been about twice as long with more information on making suits and a LOT more on using them.	2002-12-29

You get eight stories and about that many writing styles along with different artwork accompanying each entry. <BR>I'm not really a comic book fan but believe there is something here for everyone. My favorites were 'Prologue','Righteous', and 'Tales' all written by Joss Whedon followed by'Presumption' by Jane Espenson. Amber Benson's 'The Innocent' was also interesting, good to see that a Buffy cast member took an interest and could do a pretty good story.<BR>If you aren't a Buffy fan you might not care for this book but those of us who are will be able to find plenty, even if the stories are so short. My favorites were Whedon's Righteous, a sort of Joan of Arc story, followed by his Tales, the story of a future slayer finding her lost heritage (in her mind she sees past slayers, Buffy is one of them). Jane Espenson's Presumption is an interesting tale about people not being what they seem, if you don't read ahead on that one it might surprise you.	2002-12-13

Both books are semi- autobiographical, telling about how Hoffman was raised doing this subject, but this new book goes a lot more into the political and other commentary stuff. I found that you could almost ignore the first six chapters (out of only nine) of the book and still get most of what there is to learn in the book.<BR>If you want this book as a companion to the first (the readers testimonials here will either fascinate or sicken you depending on your point of view) buy it, but if you really want to learn how people dumpster dive get the first book.	2002-12-02

Each chapter is extensively footnoted (I'd like more detail in them)and features numerous quotes from various figures throughout history on what the Country's founders really meant and why they meant what they said.                                                            In many cases examples are given of the various control proposals that have been made, followed by just how they've failed. I appreciate the care given to the reporting of what many have privately, if not always publicly, said about what they really want for guns in America. <BR>This book won't convince those that refuse to be convinced but should be read by anyone who has an honest interest in the facts about gun control.	2002-12-02

To this day (1993) Hoffman professes to still live by those principals of salvaging food, clothing and all sorts of other items carelessly thrown away by other people. <BR>I think he's got a lot of hot air in what he says but so much of it rings so true that you know he's got to be right. I particularly like the tips given for conducting a search of a dumpster, how to lean in, how to watch for sharp objects, so many other things. This book really will teach you something, buy it even if you never plan to dumpster dive.	2002-12-02

Written by Mary Robertson, the American woman  who once employed Diana as a nanny, it isn't nearly as bad as some critics would suggest.The book starts with an Aug 31-Sept 6th recap of learning about Diana's death and attending the funeral, in the next chapter and for most of the book details Robertson's experiences over the years with the Princess. While Mrs. Robertson does talk about herself (not particularly boastfully)she tells a lot of harmless little details about Diana, various meetings & so on, that you just don't see elsewhere. I wouldn't put it at the top of your list of books to accquire but it makes a nice little addition.	2002-11-26

I've read all of the Rogue Warrior novels and found that as they went along that they appeared to be losing some of their attraction. This one is different in some way, I don't know if John Weisman is still a part of it (he's mentioned inside the cover, just not on the front)or not but the writing seems different somehow. I doubt that Marcinko really ever did much of the writing beyond providing someone with details, even that has changed some here. The weapons, tactics and attitude are the same but practically all of the past characters are gone without much explanation as to why. Even the profanity and boastfulness seems different somehow. I guess somebody's aim is to take the Rogue Warrior series in a new direction with new characters and a new mission (hunting homegrown terrorism perhaps?). I did like the idea of a suitcase nuke being stolen by racists who want a new order in America, and the Marcinko paln is unfortunatley just about what putting a stop to something like that would require. This story does pretty well with that this time but I'm wondering how long they can keep it up. I want the glossary of terms back in the next story too.	2002-11-06

This book gives you a lot of information on each episode including background stuff and character quotes. You'll need it to really understand what's going on sometimes.

You get a variety of recipes from all over the world including countries you might not expect to even allow alcohol. I've never brewed beer but I'd say that this book would do pretty well for extract, mini mash or all grain method brewers who have a good idea of what they're doing. While there is some introductory information and some more in the appendices I really don't think the total novice(like me) should rely on this book alone.

Each recipe is presented with three brewing methods; extract, mini-mash and All-grain.

By the authors of &quot;Clone Brews&quot; Beer Captured is also a book of copies of 150 commercially produced beers from around the world. I found this book to be an improvment over the Szmatulski's first effort in that with the book's new look you get a helpful hints section on each recipe along with serving suggestions. Divided into four sections pages 1-14 tell a lot about brewing (probably not quite enough for a complete novice), followed by pages 15-164, beer recipes, section three (165-174)has recipes for foods involving beer in them someplace (some sound very tasty.

First off, revised and updated means Oct. 1991 so the serious brewer will find that some information is as old as the photo illustrations and might in some cases need updating. Once past that you'll find a lot of information on just about anything you might need it on, this is a good book for the beginner. I think there's something on all types of beers, even some stuff on ciders and meads. Buy this book if you're starting out, you'll learn much of what you'll need to get going.

I've read several of Brown's books, they all have far out plots and wild ideas for weaponry and this one is no different. This time the gang takes on the new government of Libya, protecting Egypt along the way, it got so silly I couldn't finish it. With a band of people like those working for Skymasters you wouldn't need an army or airforce, just call them in. Maybe that's why the newage/pacifist president ropes them in at the story's end, he finally sees that they're all he needs to save the world.

The setting is a few months after Patriot Games and I guess a few months before The Hunt for Red October and I think is one of two (Patriot Games is the other)to have any significant blending of real historical characters with fictional characters. <BR>You do have some swearing but not really any more or any worse than previous efforts, Catholicism does have a big place (but no more than other Clancy books),and some will be offended by Clancy's obvious great admiration for Ronald Reagan and his policies. Ignore just those not really intrusive parts and enjoy the book, it's shorter than The Bear and The Dragon and doesn't have the unlikely future history or possibly too good to be true weapons.	2002-08-22

When ... announced that it was time to preorder I sent in my order and waited to see what I'd be getting. My first thought was that The Shelters of Stone is the biggest book yet in the series so I got out my copy of The Plains of Passage and was surprised to see that it was actually 7 pages longer. All of the books in the Earth's Children Series are long, long winded,Shelters isn't really any different. Here we get to the long awaited end of Jondalar and Ayla's long journey and like the other books for your money you get page after page of detail about all sorts of things from cooking and religion to geology, biology, and even primitive architecture. Definitely not a book for the impatient or those with a short attention span. I found this latest book to be very much like Ms. Auel's earlier efforts with only a few minor exceptions, I think Jondalar grew a couple of inches and got a year younger and Ayla's Clan accent has become either stronger or better described (it is that at least). There are still some sex scenes in this novel but they are toned down in nature from earlier stories. Some of the other reviewers seem to hate everything about this book, I see it as being remarkably consistent with the rest of the series. I do think that the new reader should start out with The Clan of The Cave Bear and work their way up to this book, you might wonder just what's going on if you just jump in the middle. I do wonder how the series can reasonably end in just one more novel(that was the original plan at least)we're left with threads for two or more it appears to me. It is a very long book but it's got something for most every one, a good book to buy.	2002-07-24
US	51737389	R1P4Q1VYF5CPXN	0671318608	248449563	The Excalibur Alternative	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Interesting ideas but reads like 2 or 3 stories in one.	I found this story interesting in that it seems a Galactic Federation seems to exist with a Prime Directive of not dominating a primitive world with advanced technology, they enslave or destroy the more advanced worlds they encounter (those with or soon to have starflight capability). In order to evade the Directive some Federation, more like our Mafia than Star Trek,members acquire armies of primitives from other worlds. At this point it is 1346 on Earth and since there are no more Romans available (here's where I found it helps to have read earlier books in the series)the lead thug in the story captures an English fleet on it's way to war with France( his rationale being they were about to be lost in a storm and won't be missed). I thought the adaptability of the captured Englishmen to be somewhat implausible but I did like the way they learned to use new materials and tactics to improve their 'primitive'abilities in the battles they are required to fight. You get some details about early battles but this part, I call it book two,is quickly run through once the English are given their orders at the start of their enslavement. From the start their 'master' is harsh, not above killing or threatening to kill one or more of their number to make a point, and seemingly unable to see the resentment and anger his policies cause. Eventually after several years of forced battles, interspersed with years in stasis between new worlds,Sir George and his men find that they have allies among the other slaves on board their masters ship. They conceive a plan of revolt and during a demonstration of power, too expensive to fight each and every tribe on the planet, the two races turn on their master killing him. Soon after this (the races take his ship) the story jumps to the middle of what I call book three. I think its now mid 22nd century, Earth has crude star travel and has been deemed a threat by the Federation and is to be destroyed. Just as Earth fleet is about to engage theenemy in a suicide run an incredibly powerful and advanced fleet comes from out of nowhere to destroy the Federation fleet. Sir George & Co. have arrived just in the nick of time to save Earth. It seems over the last few centuries using ship technologies a few hundred Englishmen, and women, with their Ternaui allies have built up an empire of a few unnoticed worlds with the eventual paln to join with Earth to defeat the evil Federation forces.	2002-05-24

I got this book to read more about the various volcanic eruptions I'd always heard of. You get a lot of detail and history about eruptions in Iceland, Hawaii, Europe and the Pacific, much of it I hadn't seen before. I didn't know most of the details given about Krakatau (usually spelled incorrectly as Krakatoa)such as weather effects and how far away the blast was heard. Did you know that people close to Mount St. Helens did not hear the blast,due to the way the sound carried, they only felt it?. That's an example of the level of detail given to the various examples of eruptions given. My one real complaint is that all measurements are given in metric format with only a small conversion table given in the preface to help people like me out. This book is well worth reading for anyone at all interested in volcanic eruptions.	2002-05-07

I think I read just about every book that Higgins comes out with and I find myself becoming disenchanted with them. I liked that early one, \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" because the attempt to kill Churchill plot was very well done. Too many of Higgins books since then have either built on that first one or followed a similar pattern, Midnight Runner is one of them. I find it entertaining for an afternoon's relaxation but the story is somewhat farfetched (an IRA hitman working for British Intelligence and the crazed half Arab woman out for revenge )and formulaic. Read it for fun, not as great literature.	2002-05-07
US	51737389	RWWIFQSUSJHC6	0684842637	648789	By Dawn's Early Light: A Novel	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Interesting plot, need to read earlier books first.	I liked the plot and the use of female characters in roles normally associated with men but found myself wanting several things...I've missed a few earlier books, reading them would help establish who's who and what. The Handyman seems both a little too good (in hits and escapes) and yet being so good manages to make some awful mistakes. I found some of the other \\"bad guy\\" characters to be much more believeable, Dodge Fench and his unnamed band of profit seeking no matter what types are just so much like what some people really are like. I won't go into details to avooid spoiling the story too much but the Chinese attempt on the President is very good (the weapon delivery is better than the weapon itself) as is her response to their actions concerning Taiwan. One last note, the story seems to be set after the term(s) of the current President Bush yet President Ballantine refers to December 7 1941 as being 58 years ago.	2002-05-07

The first half of the book seems to consist primarily of a history of Root Beer followed by 15-16 pages of recipes (short, limited in detail)many of which are only vaguely related to the subject. The book also has lists of books, supply outlets and internet sources (this may be the best part of the book)and a few other soft drink subjects. If you really want to make your own root beer or soda pop I'd say buy Stephen Cresswell's Homemade root beer and soad pop instead, I liked it much better.	2002-05-01

Much of the story is similar to what we've all read in so many books with the exception of Diana's last trip to Australia in 1996, I hadn't read about the charity aspects of that one. For a book called \\"The Truth\\" I would've either left out the love affair rumors or done a better job of proving or dispelling them (the Charles & Camilla chapter near the end didn't need to be in this book either). I do think Ms. Wade probably is right about the Dodi Fayed \\"romance\\", there wasn't one, but she possibly made too much of the Princess' relationship with Hasnat Khan. One of the wildest stories in my view, and which I have the most reservations about, is on pages X-XI in the prologue. Here Ms. Wade reports as truth a hairdresser's suspicions that the Princess had had breast implants based solely on her apparently changed cleavage. How could the world's most famous woman get that kind of surgery done without anyone finding out about it?, I think some other explanation would be more likely.	2002-03-21

For your money you'll be getting a collection of stories of incredibly stupid acts people have committed, some of them are identified as true, some as urban legends, and some as unknown. The Darwin part comes in by the fact that these people either by killing themselves or by injury became incapable of reproducing thereby not passing their stupidity on to future generations. The book is a quick read, and interesting, but will be a low priority on my accquisition list.	2002-03-08

I was disappointed in many ways, the author mentions having trimmed a 700+ page manuscript down, this book seems to still need something done to it. I wasn't expecting a how to manual on becoming a sniper, and this isn't one, but I'd like more about the subject. In this book you get a somewhat disjointed biography of what could make a very fascinating story about an amazing man but you get very little detail about almost none of his 93 confirmed kills. For the money I think the book is interesting but while some of Mr. Hathcock's victims are told about I would appreciate hearing about some of the others. I don't really care about his after VietNam years and I don't want all of the gory details of his kills but I do want to learn a little about more of his targets.	2002-02-18

I found the plot to be more or less believeable and generally well developed as were most of the characters. I do not think it is completely ridiculous to tell of a last minute sabotage attempt such as described in the story using virtually untrained women, that sort of thing does happen in so many things in real life. Follett writes of a desperate search for women who could do the mission and having to take what comes along, and the bureaucratic interference encountered when someone favored is rejected, that and the incompetence of some of the Nazi's is so true to life. The behavior of the women agents isn't exactly what you usually see in a war story but does sound like what I'd expect someone so untrained to do ( the two lesbians getting themselves captured by going out to dinner is an example)I did like the way Flick and Ruby handled themselves. FLick's new love, Paul, seemed kind of thrown in to me, I would've liked more development there. Greta, the German transevestite homosexual (actually named Gerhard) was sure a new one for a war story although he/she did work out pretty well. I could have done without the little bits of sex, they didn't really add to the story. My biggest complaint is with Mr. Follettt's writing style because every page is full of sentences like \\"He did this\\" or some other sort of fragments which really should have been cleaned up some.	2002-01-24

The book is written as though Anna had written it down herself some years after the story took place, very well done and researched with even the wording taking on a 17th century flavor but with 20th century spellings. You'll read about her very hard widowed life, her trials and tribulations as well as those of the rest of the village. The story is very detailed and can even be unpleasant, definitely not a  romantic novel but worth reading for someone who wants to know what life would've been like in rural 17th century England and the devastation brought by bubonic plague. The last chapter summarizes Anna's life as she tells her story, to me it veers away from the course of the rest of the story, perhapds reflecting the writer's Islamic interests.	2002-01-02

Much of the book concerns the woman who sang the songs on the CD, Marilyn Help,and her life as well as her reasons for the songs, most of which are not old but which she feels tell some story or teach a lesson. The last song, Go My Son, is the only one in English and is about the importance of gaining an education in todays world, another song, Kiizh (Spot)is a childrens song with a melody very recognizably based on a couple of nursery rhymes we've all heard. In the appendixes you'll find listings of pronunciation (translations of songs on the accompanying CD are within the revelant chapters), movements to perform while singing each song and bibliographies of books, recordings and  a few videos. Not a great book/CD for the casual reader or listener but very interesting for those who know the people or the area.	2001-12-30

I would like to try many of them out but find that the book needs some sort of an update. This book was evidently first printed in Britain about 1920, many of the terms would probably be obscure even to a present day British cook, let alone an American. I would also like more specific cooking information, no temperatures are given for anything, bake or boil until done is too vague for me.	2001-12-29

I was a little afraid this book would be off the wall and I've found that I was right, AlFayed looks calm and reasonable next to these guys. I really don't see why publication kept being put off unless it was in the hope that the smell would die down. The authors present just a few pages worth of peculiarities and irregularities in the crash investigation and related events and manage to weave what would be a little pretty good stuff (presented here as supporting evidence!) into all sorts of conspiracies involving international banking, arms dealing, the CIA &amp; MI6, The Catholic and Protestant Churches, the Masons, even the Royal Family and supposed links to the Scottish Stuart Royal family and Jesus Christ. I had dim hopes for this book but what I really want to say about what it is Amazon won't print.	2001-11-29

For your money you get a fairly recent photo tour of the grounds at Highrove, Prince Charles country home. There are a lot of pictures of plant life, details of some of the buildings and even some examples of outdoor sculpture. You even learn of a treehouse built for young Princes William &amp; Harry as well as a garden seat given as a wedding present to the Prince and Princess of Wales (nice to know that the Princess hasn't been completely cleared away), two of many details that I haven't seen on television or read in some book or magazine article. I consider the book to be worth owning (just don't expect much gardening information), I just wish there could be a book tour of the interior of the house and other buildings to go with it.	2001-11-26

While in some cases Mr. Nickell did appear to do a decent job of researching the selected subjects in some cases I think he let his own opinion take over. I don't require that a book find every, or even any, story to be true but I do want things to be approached in a respectful, thorough manner. In some of these things Nickell does a pretty good job of digging things out, in others he's more of an it doesn't seem likely type and doesn't dig enough for me. He can be pretty rough on his critics and his subjects (most of us would be) maybe even meaner than he says they are. I want an investigative book to look into things with an open careful attitude even if it doesn't give the result I want. You don't get that here, I think Mr. Nickelll went into it with an attitude of it's all fake and I WILL prove it so, that goes too far for me.	2001-11-23

He comes up with some interesting items here that I haven't read elsewhere, at least some of them even believable, but so much else that I'm not sure what to think about. If you have an extensive collection of books you've got a lot of his sources and you also know how unreliable some of that material can be. Nothing is clearly identified as to source here, you just get a chapter by chapter source listing near the back of the book. You get a very extensive list of books, magazines ,and newspapers and a short listing of people the author had conversations with. I noticed in that list Richard Kay (a reporter Diana was friendly with), Elsa Bowker ( I've seen her in some video interviews), and one or two hairdressers. Most of the others, who knows who they are? Just once I'd like to see a book in which the sources were close friends and even family (those people NEVER talk)of the Princess and the Prince of Wales and their sons. The between chapter quotations from the Princess and others are some of the best parts of the book. One of the trashiest parts of the book is Andersen's reporting on William's Chile trip and his supposed bed/ tent hopping. That is reported as fact without any verification, knowing the difficulties his parents are said to have had in that department, I can't think William would have risked such action even if he did want to do it.	2001-09-15

I'm not a Monarchist but from what I did get through of this book it is just plain mean. The general tone is as the subtitle says, irreverant. From one end to the other the writers spend their time denigrating the Princess as well as the Royal family, showing no liking or even respect for anyone. It seems to me to be a compilation of hatred or at least lack of respect for the subject and those who have any sort of interest and/or respect for the British Royal family and their way of life.	2001-08-09

Ms. Burchill writes for The Guardian, a liberal left leaning British paper and she is obviously what the British would call a strong republican. It appears to me that this book is an attack on the Monarchy from the first page to the last. Princess Diana herself would probably not have been spared if she'd gone along with the system. As with all the other Diana books you get some good photos but this one is a little too mean otherwise.	2001-07-31

Most book writers spend their time trying to trash the Princess or the Royal Family(sometimes both), this book is fairly even handed. They do appear to have made an effort to talk to people or research material representing both sides of the story, most unusual.

These books are only about a third, or less, the length of what Tom Clancy does these days but they have a lot of detail that just seems to make sense to me, even the plot line of this story isn't totally out of whack.

I've collected several Straw Bale building books and this is perhaps the most informative of them all. It's not bulky,143 pages,but covers almost everything. Most books just gloss over most of the details and while this one doesn't pretend to tell it all you do get a good start and leads for further information. I really appreciate the construction details shown here, most of the books just kind of talk about stacking bales and plastering, this one gives enough detail that you'll know whether or not you want to actually build this way.	2001-06-08

At 373 pages it can get very technical at times so while you will learn a lot about building this book will be too deep for the casual reader just curious about the possibility of building. A casual reader would like more diagrams than he or she will find here.	2001-06-08

It seemed to cover just about all of the details a first time brewer would need to brew up some very interesting drinks. One reviewer says it doesn't tell you where to get supplies, true but the book does give some idea and addresses can change with time anyway. Most of the ingredients and implements needed you'll find that you already have or can easily obtain at any time. My only complaint concerns the carbonation process, the author says when it is right refrigerate the drink, he is vague about what that point in the process is. I think I found it with careful reading.	2001-04-19

Both books are fun to read and in a desparate situation they might help you save yourself but as they say, Don't try this yourself. There isn't really enough information on any of the subjects to really do safety training justice ( a whole book would be needed for each one to do that)so buy it in the spirit of curiosity with a touch of education. If you're on a limited book budget stick with their first book.	2001-04-19

It seems to me that probably every needed area is covered but it may be too much information at once for someone who would like to try brewing for the first time. I guess that the information is there, it's just that there is so much else (probably all worthwhile)included that the timid novice might feel like abandoning the attempt.	2001-04-19

I got my copy from a U.K. source several months ago and was surprised at the writing quality.

With her connections Ms. Seward is bound  to have learned a lot of things ( that's the only reason I give it a three)but her book runs from praise to assault to smear on just about everyone, even the Queen.

My complaint, minor, is that with the inevitable editing of material required by compressing three months of material into a small book or a few hours of video something is often lost. Some details in the program aren't even mentioned in the book and vice versa. I'm still waiting on my copy of the video, apparently it's on a long backorder, but I'd say get both because they make a fascinating combination.	2001-01-24

I've got the 20th edition, haven't used it yet but it seems reasonably thorough. For your money you get a travel guide that covers just about everything briefly without being too wordy. You do not get a picture book although there are some, generally small, photographs not of the pornographic sort of people and of some of the sites.

I found it to be generally very well done with few pictures that were particularly erotic even though most were of nudes (generally of girls or women). I sometimes thought that the composition and lighting were a little odd (off centered or speck in the distance shots for example)but most poses were good. I especially liked the way Sturges showed some of his subjects as they aged through the years from childhood to womanhood. I do wish that the photo titles and dates were on the same page instead of on a separate paper, that made for very inconvenient reading having to constantly refer back and forth. Much better photographer than David Hamilton.	2000-12-05

VERY little to complain about in this book. Scarcely anything that could be considered objectionable by anyone willing  to accept nude photography. Most of the photos date from 1996-2000,  (one '83 and one '95),and are generally of girls or young women mostly nude but a few photos of clothed people. I liked the way Sturges handles light in almost all of his photos, composition did seem a little stilted to me in a few of them. I think it's great that he was able to use the same subjects over the years, obviously the man can get along with people. The color photos were welcome, showing the man is willing to vary his medium and well capable of doing so. One improvement over his last, self titled, book is the inclusion of his subject's name,location and date on the opposite page, much easier to follow than a separate sheet as that last book was presented.	2000-11-28

Mr. Dodds writes brief sections about his own background or something about how he met the Princess and the floral work he did for her.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that much of what he writes is true but what a book! Jephson will praise the Princess in one line or paragraph but then he'll tear into her the next and still be writing about the same thing. It also appears that he claims to be responsible for much of what good the Princess did from planning events (or salvaging them)to writing most of her speeches. Such a smart guy, loved the good life too, no wonder she let him resign. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Mr. Jephson was hard to live and work with and would have been put out if he hadn't left. Charles Spencer says the guy was more interested in his bank balance than the truth. Patrick Jephson and James Hewitt are two of a kind, both traitors and business failures, who care about money more than decency.	2000-11-10

One thing I found very irritating was the continual use of And or But to start sentences, very bad practice according to what I learned in my school days. I also noticed that AK-47 M-16 blunder, made me think that the writers (assuming that Frakes actually DID do any writing)have no experience with weapons.

Mr. Gregory seems to have a powerful dislike for Mohamed al Fayed. 2.Since the wildest conspiracy theories don't hold up he seems to think that means none of the rumors could be true. I agree that the Princess likely did die in an accident but to absolutely rule out foul play is going too far.

Ms. Snell uses other books(listed in  back) as references, no real problem with that but then she goes further  and uses anonymous sources. I never really like that because you have no  way of knowing how good that source is or whether or not they might have a  grudge against the subject. I suspect that some enemies of the Princess  more than her friends contributed, that stuff about Diana trying to pay  Simone Simmons with gifts instead of cash is an example of this. Anything  I've ever read indicates to me that she most likely would not have done  this (although she could be very generous with gifts), that would be a  trait more of the born Royals. The love life details, are they true? I  don't know, the Princess is dead and Hasnat Khan isn't talking. A person  should also remember that in 1997 his relatives embarassed him by talking  so much, sounds to me like they're still at it.	2000-09-19

I found the book to be typical Tom Clancy  material with lots of interesting military stuff, some political  commentary, lots of detail. I could have done with less of the #%!** words  although I think that it was probably what you could expect in the real  world. I did notice, as I have in many of Clancy's other books, the  irritating tendency to mix times and dates up. He has Ryan in high school  during the Cuban missle crisis,(that would be 1961),yet from reading other  books in the series the guy could only be in his early to mid 40's. Another  detail gone wrong is the mention of the Capitol Dome, that was destroyed in  Executive Orders. A little detail clean up would improve things greatly.	2000-09-19

While there were a number of flaws most were small (Diana wasn't called Di by friends, Dodi Fayed didn't use the Al honorific, a few other minor  problems). About the worst thing I could find wrong was the omission of  just who helped Diana and Dodi in their new life. It seems to me that the  Royal, Spencer and AlFayed families would have to assist the time travelers  in their efforts. I can't imagine that the Princess could've had a happy  life with Dodi but this book is still better than &quot;Whose death in the  tunnel?&quot; by Aaron McCallum Becker.	2000-06-29

I've noticed in the last few books Cussler includes himself, sort of, as a  character, he does it in this one too. You will also find the heroes  getting wounded several times but still managing against all odds to save  the day.My only real complaint is that this story seems to ignore the  discovery of the Alexandria Library (surely it would've had something about  the Amenes)In  the end Al tells Dirk they're getting too old for this and  need to quit.

I've noticed in the last book or two that the  sories are beginning to wear down and in this book Marcinko himself  mentions getting old to do these missions so maybe its time for him to  retire.	2000-06-10

I agree with the 1&amp;2 star reviews, save your money  unless you've got to have every Diana book because this one just repeats  everything we've all already heard and doesn't do it well. Moira Johnston,  who ghost wrote Trevor Rees-Jones book, would've done it better.	2000-06-06

The facts to the story as presented fit so well with established history that it's got to be right. Some say it disproves conspiracies, I disagree,Mr. Rees-Jones  doesn't remember all details or even that Henri Paul was drunk. While it  may very well have been an accident drunkeness might have affected others  actions towards the Mercedes. An attempted scare or attack could still have  happened as some claim.	2000-05-19

For such a smart military man Hewitt was a failure at  that. He also doesn't seem to have been much of a business man either,  going from a fine home and a growing business to nothing in a matter of  months. Fighting with the Mirror over those letters shouldn't have caused  that, he's just a hopeless cad, just as the papers say. The poor boy  couldn't even keep some of his details straight and some of those details  don't come close to other's accounts (Wendy Berry, The Housekeepers Diary,  is one example)who had no love for the Prince and Princess. The creep is  just out for money and attention BUY SOMETHING ELSE!	1999-11-01

Diana, never Di, didn't have enough money to disappear yet leave her sons 35 million or so. She wouldn't leave without telling someone she was going.One reviewer calls her an accessory to  murder, she didn't know of them (they were also unlikely)Generally written  at a 9th grade level LEAVE IT ALONE!	1999-09-16

I've just read this book and found very little fault with it. Spencer  doesn't talk about himself excessively and doesn't overuse his sister  Princess Diana either.All I could really ask for is the inclusion of more  pictures and that probably wasn't practical	1999-04-19
