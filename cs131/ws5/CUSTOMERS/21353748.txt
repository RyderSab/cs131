The only choices the ranchers had were to sell out or drive toward Montana which is what this story is about, Frank Kinnaird who had been looking for an outlaw to help clear his name in a frame up was just the experienced trail driver to help Jesse Buckmaster and his lovely looney daughter Jaimie drive their herds the long thousand miles, but Worth Arnett an ardent suitor of Jaimie is jealous of Frank and will do anything to stop their drive and regain Jaimie's affections.  My only complaint is that Mr. Lomax portrays Jaimie as an immature overly jealous unreasonable female(much as my ex-wife:-)and if indeed at the end of the story Frank and Jamie do get together then I guarantee you that this marriage won't last very long at all, I have to assume that Bliss Lomax must have had a wife like this to be able to write about it so well.

This is so bad that I was unable to finish the book, the copyright is by P.F. Collier & Son in 1933 which leads me to believe that it was published as a serial by Collier's magazine.  The story as far as I was able to read was about a small rancher returning to his ranch after recovering from an ambusher's bullet and is immediately shot at again only this time by a mysterious beautiful woman, all of the women in these westerns are beautiful but most of the guys(besides the hero)are rather gruesome, how about a little equality here:-), of course there is the big bad rancher that wants our hero's ranch for the water and of course it was his hired gun that shot said hero. I think that all of the writers of the time signed contracts to write x number of books per year for their publisher and I believe that the quality of their writing suffered for these contracts, I have noticed this in Luke Short and Louis L'Amour among others.	2005-02-25

Story revolves around a killer for hire who just may be the devil or the devil's advocate, the good guy is the local saloon owner/bartender instead of the usual harness maker and gunsmith that Lauran Paine is so fond of writing about, a very good book even though I am not a fan of the supernatural genre, this all takes place in and around Calabasas, New Mexico, and unlike your typical western there is no rancher's lovely daughter, Rourke the saloon guy is an older man like as in many of Mr. Paine's stories, I understand that Mr. Paine wrote as many as 1000 books with 900 or so published, you should be able to say that writing was his life. I have read most of Zane Grey, Ernest Haycox, Luke Short, Peter Dawson, Louis L'Amour and William Macleod Raine's  books, I don't think that I will be able to say the same of Lauran Paine, he wrote under many other names which you can look up under a.k.a. on the Lukol search engine.	2005-02-21

This apparently is one of a hundred plus about a rich beautiful woman and her handsome oriental sidekick that overcome adverse odds, she by shooting the badguys guns out of their hands and he by slinging something called a shuriken, I would call the writing juvenile except I don't have anything against juveniles.  They both have sexual encounters with other partners and I would have to assume that this is why these kind of stories sell, if only someone else had written a review then I would have known not to buy this book.	2004-11-08

When Dave Wallace reads in the newspaper that an old friend was caught in a blizzard and froze to death he doesn't believe it and rides to find out what did happen, then he is given bad information as to water holes on the way across an arid desert region, this really tips him off as to the truth of what has happened to the friend, he runs into the ranch hand that gave him the bad info and whomps him to a fairly thee well and this in turn gets the fellow's crew and an unbelieving marshall on his case and he is ran out of town and from here on the story just gets better and better, needless to say I like Luke Short's writing and think this is one of his best.	2004-10-29
US	21353748	R3JYLJXSXMGF0T	0843948205	689601808	Tumbleweeds	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Short story collection.	Well written as to be expected from Will Henry, but still it is just a collection of 12 short stories in 248 pages and there can't be much character development or as far as that goes much story development, I thought it was a complete novel or I would not have bought it, perhaps the name tries to explain that.	2004-10-27
US	21353748	RWH7HRCMDCSL4	0449132978	539440515	Horseman	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Better than "Open Range"	A story involving a bank robbing(justifiably so) doctor being pursued by a Wyoming posse into Colorado where this action takes place, a well to do rancher with a lovely daughter(naturally)and a breeder of horses, who is the leading character of this story,  with action, suspense, mystery and romance, another book that is very hard to put down but at the same time not wanting to finish it so quickly.	2004-10-14

A very good read, suspense and action about 2 old timers, one a harness maker and the other a gunsmith and a Marshall not quite so old pursuing via stagecoach with a brief stop in jail a murderous gang of bank robbers, with enough humor to make it so good that I couldn't put it down, since it is labeled on the front cover as \\"A Sheridan Township Western\\" I would assume that there is at least one more but I haven't been able to locate it or them yet. Written by the author of \\"Open Range\\".	2004-10-13

This story takes place in l858 and involves much to the leading up to of the Civil war, it  jumps back and forth between so many characters, the leading person of the story \\"Nathanial Barrington\\" is a drunk in an unhappy marriage that had previously served in the U.S. Army in New Mexico but had since resigned his commission to return to New York City but being unhappy there decides to return to the frontier as the assistant indian commissioner to assist the murderous Apache indian tribes of the area(southeastern New Mexico), there is much about Kansas striving for statehood with the slavery problem muddling the issue, Robert E. Lee is briefly in the story as well as U.S. Grant pawning a watch in a pawn shop in St. Louis, I suspect that the author is a frustrated history teacher, this is one of 5 books being labeled a \\"trilogy\\", someone apparently got carried away trilogizing, think I will skip the rest of the series:-(.	2004-10-07

Just another great story by Wayne Barton & Stan Williams, a marshall on the trail of the killers of his partner gets involved in the makings of a range war between two ranchers instigated by the bad guys, read this one carefully to see if you can figure out who the other bad guy is, it had me stumped as I couldn't wait to find out and really hated to finish the book, one of the best that I have read in a long time.	2004-09-27

An innocent man(Gutherie McGuire) sent to prison breaks out with revenge on his mind, it is never revealed as to who framed him and or why, the story is more about the temporary Marshall(Cal Sawyer)it must have been Quentin the evil brother of Clayton Usery who pretty much owns and runs the town of Grafton, New Mexico that did the framing with the help of some town folks.  It is almost like someone else wrote the second half of the book without really knowing the story up to that point, still it was my kind of western story, this was my first James Powell book, I will have to try at least one more.	2004-09-24

This is the best of many wonderful stories written by Mr. Raine, the good guys get the bad guys, it has some wonderful humor in it also, Sheriff Bear Trap Val Collins and Ranger Bucky O'Connor make a durable duo, the old hard covers written in l907 and l910 have 4 illustrations that really add to the book, I recall reading this type of book about 50 years ago as a youngster.	2004-09-16

Historically factual with of course a romance involved, there are some shoot outs but the type of guns used are never mentioned which is a little odd to this reader.	2004-09-12

A little humor with just enough action to make an interesting story.	2004-09-12
