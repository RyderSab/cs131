Mike Walker brings to the book all the outrageous flair that he would bring his National Enquirer readers.  <br /> <br />\\"Rather Dumb\\" brings back memories of Dan marching off the set, his big interview with George Bush Sr., and his bizarre mugging (\\"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\\"). <br /> <br />The final (third or so) part of the book deals with the Texas Air National Guard memo \\"gate\\" controversy. While the results of the investigation and the firings of Mary Mapes and other CBS employees occur after the book was published, all of the info contained is \\"on the money\\".  <br /> <br />Courage.	2005-07-25

The novel is about nanotechnology, but it deals also with the evolution of atom-sized robots and the computer intelligence that drives them. The word \\"Prey\\", which the book is titled, refers to the program that gives the killer swarm its instructions.    It is a really good read. Crichton has a way of weaving together science fiction and the terrifying consequences of science's alleged misuse into a really good story.    If you are totally new to nanotechnology, \\"Prey\\" is a good, albeit fictitious, introduction.    Another winner from Michael Crichton.	2005-05-30

A lot of the Scripture references that I found were not even close to what the actual verse said, or the Scripture reference wasn't even found in that particular book and chapter. Also, I also found this to be the case in a lot of the study notes as well.<br /><br />Accuracy is key. This looks like it was just thrown together and published without any careful editing.	2005-05-29

As the author brilliantly points out, the human element is the weakest link in IT security. It doesn't matter how much hardware stands in the way of the hacker (or \\"social engineer\\"), security is often compromised by the unsuspecting employees who operate the computers, and are in most cases just asked for the passwords so the hackers can gain access. <br /> <br />Full of examples of attacks on companies and individuals, \\"Art of Deception\\" is a must-read for anyone who works in the IT field, as well as anyone who uses a computer. It also contains practical ways to safeguard information, and most of it is pretty much common sense.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-05-29

The Republicans and the Democrats are pretty much interchangeable today. Will there be a return to the conservative principles of the past? Can it be done? Pat Buchanan explores what happened. <br /> <br />Also, Buchanan explains that the war in Iraq had been in the works for about a decade before the invasion. The only thing holding back Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, and the rest of the neocons was the right moment to act. And the right moment came twofold: <br /> <br />1. The 9-11 attacks <br />2. George W. Bush <br /> <br />We are warned that the war waged by the terrorists is a holy war, and according to history, one that Muslims are willing to wage for their cause. They will not give up. The World Trade Center wasn't attacked because America is \\"good,\\" but because our troops were on Saudi soil. It was our policies, not our philosophy, that led Osama Bin Laden to issue attack orders against the U.S. <br /> <br />There are other issues Buchanan discusses in the book, such as: <br /> <br />* Can the war against terrorism be won? <br />* Foreign policy with regards to China. <br />* Congressional pork-barrel spending. <br />* Free trade. <br />* Judicial activism.	2005-05-27

It's funny--the author, conservative drum-beater Hugh Hewitt, wrote an entire chapter comparing the internet age to the invention of the printing press and the publishing of the first Bibles, and how it rocked the world of that time. I say it's funny, because I had thought exactly about the comparison before I read \\"Blog\\". And he's exactly right. <br /> <br />Face it: the bloggers are here, and here to stay. Like the sixteenth-century Catholic hierarchy fearing the impact of the printing press on their own power, the mainstream media is running scared of the blogs, and takes every opportunity to discredit them whenever they can, often blasting them for writing their blog entries \\"in their pajamas\\" or underwear or whatever.  <br /> <br />Hewitt documents the history (albeit brief) of the blog craze, and how it was used to bring down reporters and politicians from boths sides of the political spectrum (Dan Rather, Trent Lott).  <br /> <br />A must-read for all who embrace technology.	2005-05-27

Naked, only bathing maybe once or twice a year, with hair down to his backside, beard down to his navel, eating maybe once a day at the most, and storing his urine in Mason jars, Hughes writes out memos to his Mormon aides detailing to them, among other things, how to \\"sterilize\\" canned fruit to be served to him, despite the fact that his hotel room hasn't been cleaned in years. He also schemes about his plans to make Vegas in his image, including ways to allow people from all over the world to phone in to bookies to place bets and win big. <br /> <br />Howard Hughes, in his final years, lived only for self. He considered himself the perfect man, a megalomaniac who shoots up with enough drugs to kill a horse, and writes out his orders on legal pads instead of picking up a phone or showing up at board meetings in person. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Dating Game\\" <br /> <br />For example, as Hughes is poised to buy the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the deal dies in less than thirty minutes, due to his racist tendencies (out of fear, not hatred). He tunes in to \\"The Dating Game\\", to see a black man have to choose a date between what Hughes thought was two black women and one \\"white\\" woman. The man chooses the \\"white\\" woman, who in fact is not white but is actually a very light skinned black woman. But it doesn't matter to Hughes: out of his bizarre fear, the deal is off. <br /> <br />In conclusion... <br />A wacky story of a genius who became so afraid of the world that he \\"tried\\" to control it through his TV and his henchmen.	2005-05-27

Instead, they sit around for hours and watch giant screens at home, viewing mind-numbing programming with no real intellectual value. Then, they get in the car and drive 90+ mph, not even for a second thinking about the danger that they put themselves in. People no longer care about anything really. They no longer think for themselves. They have no ideas that make them unique individuals. <br /> <br />Sound familiar? It can be honestly said that today, the TV has replaced reading as the number one mode of aquiring information for the majority of people in our nation. They have their minds filled overflowing with ideas that the program presents. And this is how people shape their worldview today. After all, all \\"normal\\" women look like Cindy Crawford or Halle Berry, right? All kids have sex before marriage, right? Everyone has to look like they do on TV, and be like the \\"normal\\" families portrayed on TV...right? <br /> <br />In the year 2004, the vast majority of what is seen on TV is absolute garbage. No? Well, OK. To each his own. If you think that watching a fashion model having needles pierced up and down her arm in order to win a challenge is perfectly fine to watch, then OK. If you think gay men running around an island butt naked is considered normal during the \\"family\\" hour, or having kids in a game show soaked with green slime, or someone having plastic surgery and cosmetic dentistry in order to win a beauty contest, or... <br /> <br />Thankfully, we don't have to worry about losing our First Amendment rights; there are enough watchdog groups around to ensure that our rights don't disappear. May God help us all if we ever did. The Bill of Rights ensures that in the corner of the world in which we live, we have the freedom to ignore the \\"idiot box\\" and read a good book, or newspaper, or magazine, or whatever we want to read without fear of arrest or intimidation. <br /> <br /> <br />In the \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" world, books are illegal. Since everyone got their dose of enlightenment from the big screen and didn't care about reading anymore, the government said, \\"Since no one reads anymore, why do we need books?\\" and promptly banned all of them. Those fortunate ones who manage to hang on to a few tomes for their enjoyment are paid a visit by the fire department. <br /> <br />The \\"firemen\\" in this story, unlike their real-world counterparts, start fires, instead of extinguish them. Kerosene shoots out of their hoses instead of water. The FD (with the number \\"451\\" on their uniforms, indicating the temperature in which paper burns) is dispatched to the \\"criminal's\\" home, and not only sets the books ablaze, but also the home in which they are hidden. After all, they have to set an example to the rest of the community that books are bad and if you are caught with them, your books and your home are toast...literally. <br /> <br />The central character in the book, named Montag, is one of these firemen. For years, he has done his job setting fires, and he does it well. But after a run-in with a girl who's a free thinker, and a professor who remembers the days when books were taken for granted, he begins to question why the firemen have to burn the books at all. <br /> <br />Though written over half a century ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is no longer considered science fiction. It is a glimpse of the future to come, and a warning of what the future could hold for us.	2005-05-27

The other day I saw a commercial for a nationally recognized brand of laundry detergent. The housewife is busy doing all the things that \\"good housewives\\" do: cleaning up after the kids, doing the housework, while her husband is sound asleep in the backyard on the hammock. <br />She never frowns; even when she looks out the window and sees her husband sleeping instead of mowing, she has this smile on her face that looks like someone who has seen God. <br />Suddenly the camera cuts to the housewife in the laundry room. The commercial's announcer tells about how clean and soft and fresh smelling the laundry is after using their product, at the same time you should have seen the look on this woman's face. <br />She looked to be in total ecstasy doing the laundry. Her face is beaming; she is hugging the laundry with a big grin on her face. She looked like she was on cloud nine. <br />And I am sitting there thinking to myself, Are there really women in this world who act like this while doing housework? <br /> <br />The fictional town of Stepford, CT is such a place. It is a town that only women like Carol Brady, June Cleaver, and Harriet Nelson would be proud of. Oh yeah, and the detergent lady, too. <br />The world of Stepford is perfect. Busy housewives who live only to cook and clean house. Husbands who labor hard at the office by day, and in the evenings they retreat to the local men's club for some fraternizing with the other members. <br />While all this may sound really good, there seems to be something sinister going on behind the scenes of the mysterious men's club...or, is there anything happening at all? <br />One by one, the new residents of Stepford are transformed in a pretty predictable pattern. Shortly after they move in to town, the husband joins the men's club. Meanwhile, the wife is baffled as to why the other women in the community stay at home all the time and do housework and never go out. After a few months the husband and wife take off for a romantic weekend getaway. Finally, shortly after they arrive back home the wife turns into the robot-like housewife like the other Stepford wives. <br />The central character of the novel, Joanna Eberhardt, is bound and determined that this will not happen to her. She has to search for the reason behind the bizarre behavior of the women and find out what is behind the transformation...before she becomes Stepford's newest \\"domestic diva\\".	2005-05-27

But, as translations of the Bible come on the market (nowadays, there seems to be a new one every year or two), the King James Version is still the standard. <br />I have never given up on a word or phrase that is confusing or hard to understand. It just makes me dig deeper to find the meaning of the passage. Besides, many of the Bible reference books on the market (Strongs Concordance, Vine's Dictionary of New Testament Words, etc.) are published to help those who are willing understand the KJV better. There is, in my opinion, no reason to put the KJV down.<br />Own a piece of Christian history...buy one today!	2004-06-16
