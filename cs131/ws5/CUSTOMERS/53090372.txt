They are good friends, although near polar opposites, they are deeply loyal to their friends, and they are significantly more than they seem. Their names are Grey and Norville, and they are birds.  <br /> <br />Knowing that Mercedes Lackey is in love with birds, it would not have surprised me that Grey and Norville would make a return engagement. In Wizard of London, Lackey includes the material from her stories \\"Grey\\" and \\"Grey's Ghost\\" in a new novel that combines her stories about paranormals with the stories of the Elemental Masters. (You can read the original stories online at the Baen Free Library, where Misty has graciously permitted Werehunter to be posted.) <br />In this new story, we meet the young Lord Alderscroft, as he is just starting up the wizard's circle in his club that we've seen before. We also find out that ice is as important as Fire, even though it is not one of the cardinal elements. <br /> <br />While most people thought this might be the end of the Elemental Masters stories, it appears that this might instead be the beginning of a new chapter entirely. <br /> <br />Nice work, Misty! <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-09-24

John Scalzi has produced a novel that, like Robert Buettner's \\"Orphanage\\" books, is indebted to Heinlein and Haldeman, but in this book, he creates a new world to shake out the ideas from \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"The Forever War\\" and see how they land in a new pile. <br />This is a terrific book. You know you have a great book when a best-selling author recommends it to you, as Eric Flint did to me with \\"Old Man's War.\\" It was worth the recommendation, and well worth the read.  <br /> <br />I understand a sequel is in the works, and I am waiting, rather impatiently, to read it. <br /> <br />Why are you still reading this?

In \\"Orphanage\\" Buettner clearly owes Heinlein and Haldeman, but what he does with their headstart is clearly his own trope. <br /> <br />Buettner's take is very much post 9-11 in sensibilities, and his government is even more cynical than Haldeman's, and almost as \\"fascist\\" as Heinlein's.  <br /> <br />His orphans are the same ones Heinlein drafted to fight the Bugs, and Haldeman drew from his Vietnam experiences in \\"The Forever War.\\" Buettner's orphans fought the Assyrians, marched in the Roman Legions, and posed for clay statues for the grave of Shi Huang Ti. They fought \\"o'er Afghanistan's plain,\\" and went with Kitchener to Khartoum, and charged up Cemetary Ridge with Pickett. They are the ones who always come forward to put their own bodies between \\"their loved homes and the war's desolation.\\" <br />Jason Wander is an innocent. He remains, to some degree, an innocent throughout the book. <br /> <br />This is an allegory for peace that is masquerading as an action adventure sci-fi epic. <br /> <br />It is allegorical in the same way that \\"Starship Troopers\\" is. We see Heinlein's didactic novel as \\"fascistic\\" but really it is not. He makes an argument that the only people who should have the franchise are people who are willing to work for the state: in whatever capacity, not just as a trooper. <br /> <br />Orphanage is an outstanding first novel, and as his writing improves we should see much more of Mr. Buettner. <br /> <br />I am waiting...in fact I went right out and bought the sequel. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-09-18

He makes it clear that the event had to have been caused. The most likely theory is Alien Space Bats... <br />Sterling introduces us to characters that are real, that have backstory, and that you can care about. You even, sometimes watching yourself with horrified gaze, care about the bad guys like Eddie Liu and Norman Arminger. <br />I enjoyed this book when I first read it, and I've re-read it several times. <br />Sometimes, as he did in the Islands series, Stirling beats you over the head with his point, but once you have been willing to suspend disbelief, the story carries you on breathlessly to the conclusion. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-09-11

I have been impatiently waiting for this book ever since Dies the Fire came out. I have to say I am disappointed. There are parts of the book that are WONDERFUL and there are what appear to be huge chunks missing from the plot and from the story, as if the editor (or Stirling himself) took an axe to the manuscript. <br />Lakaeditn is an old Hawaiian illness peculiar to extremely successful authors, similar to lakanookie, a disease peculiar to geeky kids.  <br />What I think is that this book should have been edited much better. <br />For example, the book abruptly switches from Stirling's normal, and very well done, linear exposition mode, to retrograde exposition where the point of view starts to shift and then returns to the omniscient editor. Each time this happens, the book seems to start over. It is as if Stirling wrote four or five versions of the same book, and then shuffled the pages of the ms. together and sent it to the editor. <br />The thing that bothers me the most is that the book could have been and should have been one of the best books Steve Stirling has ever written. His writing style has improved, and his infatuation with kinky sex for the sake of kinky sex has been reduced to normal levels.  <br />In addition, the bad guys become less like scary sociopaths and cardboard villains, and become real people. To be able to make us care about the Lord Protector and his wife, and about King Charles III is terrific writing. <br />Now I can go back to waiting to find out what really happens in the Protector's War, which still hadn't started by the epilogue. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-09-11

John Ringo and David Weber's Anabasis series, the \\"March to...\\" books, seem to have come to a climax and a good place to end it. We Few is the ne'erdowell prince's homecoming. It sure is good that plots are free. The freewheeling authors have combined the Anabasis with the good parts of Henry V, with Prince Roger as the Good Prince Hal, who learns to put away childishness and be King. <br />Because both authors have not one shred of sentimentality between them, We Few doesn't have a happy ending. Neither, amazingly enough, does life. <br />Ringo and Weber again produce a tour de force. It is hard to imagine a series with such incredibly high standards of plot, writing, and characterization, but each of the \\"March to...\\" books stands alone as excellent fiction, science, military subgenre. Not only that, but each is highly literate for those that get the jokes, and may even send some of the less literate out to look for the originals of the plots and characters. <br />Nicely done, gentlemen, nicely. done. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-09-11

In an incredible change of pace from his signature Posleen Carnography series, John Ringo has written the first of a series that will make you think, rail against his points, and maybe even change your point of view about some of the trends in modern society. <br />For thousands of years, Mother has taken care of us. The giant artificial intelligence, with the help of her bazillions of nanobots, has provided instantaneous transportation, food, lodging, education (if you want it), heat, light, health care, and just about anything you could wish for, including the ability to change shape to any natural or mythological being your little heart desires. <br />Alas, she hasn't been able to rid the world of psychopaths, and several of them have amassed great power. Power enough to turn much of Mother's safety net off, and turn humanity back to having to do for itself. <br />This may be a good thing, or it may be a bad thing, but the fact remains that billions died. <br />This makes it pretty clear who the bad guys are. <br />The good guys, like all the true heroes, have to discover who they are, and what their duty is, and what the limits of what they can do really are. <br />The classic example of this is Herzer Herrick, who starts out as a helpless cripple shortly before the Crash, and winds up as the world's Second Greatest Soldier. (Maybe third, you'll have to read the book to find out what I'm talking about). <br />Read this book.

Williamson is fast becoming one of the best action/adventure and military SF writers around. His ability to work in a political point of view is getting better, and less didactic, with every novel. In Freehold, sometimes the framing shows through, while in his later work, he's smoother. But listen, I have read Freehold four times now, and I still see new stuff: the mark of a very good book. <br /> <br />Freehold is many kinds of book. It is an action/adventure book...there's lots of action. It is a military SF book: as with Heinlein, as with Weber, as with Drake, and others, the military virtues set in the future with neat tech make interesting characters and bloody plotlines. But Freehold is really an allegorical tale of the price of sheephood.  <br /> <br />Kendra Pacelli finds that she really isn't a sheep, when her government tries to frame her for something she didn't do. And then she finds out she isn't a wolf, either. So, she joins the great grey tribe of sheepdogs, as a guardian of her newly chosen home, the Freehold of Grainne. <br /> <br />Earth and the United Nations cannot leave Grainne alone. It is up to the sheepdogs to protect themselves. <br /> <br />This is an excellent novel, and, like many soi-disant space operas, is really a way for the author to make you think about what is going on now, in real time, by looking at an extrapolation which is extremely believable, and truly terrifying. <br /> <br />Go buy this book, but not if you want your assumptions checked at the door. <br /> <br />This is a great read. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-09-10

I think it is the best of his Targets series so far, and he thinks it is the weakest. Where is it written that authors can analyze their own books correctly? <br /> <br />In this book, Williamson adds complexity to the already complex plots and characterizations of Kyle Monroe and Wade Curtis, his lone wolf Paladins from Targets of Opportunity and The Scope of Justice. Not only is their mission much less defined, they are also burdened by a desk warrior who seizes on the opportunity to make his bones in a \\"special ops\\" role. <br /> <br />Do they get their mission done? Do they carry their commanding burden (oops, I meant commanding officer) or do they frag him? Do the terrorists win one, or can Monroe and Curtis pull another one out of the bag? <br /> <br />And what will this mean to the introspective Monroe? How long can he go on doing this without going over the edge? <br /> <br />Well, I'm not going to tell you the answers. To find out, it will cost you. You will have to send Mad Mike Williamson money.

Murphy's Urban Shaman is one of the new generation of fantasy/sf from Luna Books, new home of Mercedes Lackey. Set in present day Seattle, it doesn't stay there very much. The lead character, an interesting police person, who really doesn't want to be a police person, is also a half Native American in severe denial. As she is flying back from Ireland where she was burying her Irish mother, she sees from the airplane as it is landing what she thinks is an attack on a woman. Inexplicably, she tears off out of the airport, flags down a cab, and inserts herself into the situation, never to be the same again. <br />There are some of the creaks and groans of a first novel, but it has been well edited, and the descriptions of shamanic activity are accurate and believable. <br />Also believable is the characterization...even the rather heavyhanded \\"I hate you\\" romance between the shaman and her Anglo police boss. <br /> <br />Read this book, so Luna will give C.

And what would they be doing? <br /> <br />In Bedlam's Edge, they've opened their universe to other writers, including talented newcomers Barb and Michael Caffrey (who sadly, passed away suddenly and too young), who share their own takes on the world of Urban Elves.  <br /> <br />Dave Freer and Eric Flint, Mercedes Lackey's co-authors in the Heirs of Alexandria series (if you haven't read the series, go immediately and buy all of them, including A Mankind Witch, the latest.), Roberta Gellis, Rosemary Edghill, India Edghill, and Mercedes Lackey herself all contributed to this excellent collection of short stories. <br /> <br />Do you have to have read all the other books in the series to enjoy this one?

It might just be me, though, because I've read every one, and one more than once. <br /> <br />Her world is not the typical urban vampire scenario, nor is it the typical horror story. In her world, a witch can live with a vampire, and a whole family of pixies, in an abandoned church which still has sacred ground. In her world, the health department issues \\"No biting\\" ratings for vampire-owned nightclubs so humans can feel safe about going there. <br /> <br />If this picture is a little skewed, good.

Some of his characters weren't fleshed out, and some were intentionally cardboard. It was a didactic novel in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein, but Kratman did not have the technical skills to bring it off at the level that the Master could. <br /> <br />Now, with John Ringo (it appears that Kratman did most of the writing), he has written a mature second novel, Watch on the Rhine.  <br /> <br />His characters are excellently well drawn, and his writing style has matured considerably since his first book. He also stays unblinkingly &lt;u>real&lt;/u> in his portrayal of humans in desperate straits. <br /> <br />His Greens and Watermelons are so bad that I kept asking myself, would they really do that? And I kept sinking back into the novel when my answer came back to me as \\"yes.\\" And finally, his Posleen appear as more than evil BEMs...they have feelings, a culture, and are 'people' too. <br /> <br />I was very put off by the idea of resurrecting \\"Nazi Supermen\\" to fight the Posleen. Kratman and Ringo rang some surprising changes on the theme, with enough skill and daring to make you really think over what the Waffen SS really was, and if they were tarred with the Nazi brush somewhat mistakenly...and then they hit you in the face because even good people can fight for evil causes. When asked, one of the characters replies, \\"Oh, yes, there is one real Nazi here, and we all hate him, but he is a really good tank driver.\\" Sometimes needs must, when the devil drives. <br /> <br />-----WARNING! SNERK ALERT!---- <br /> <br />One subplot that just sticks with me, and is pivotal in the plot of the novel, is the death of Gudrun and especially the last scene in which we see her head. Kratman's writing is uncompromising and even though the scene bears all the hallmarks of the grotesque, it forces the reader to care about not only the humans, but in a strange sort of way, for the Posleen too. They are, after all, victims of the Aldenata and the Darhel, too. <br /> <br />Kratman (and Ringo, who must be an excellent teacher) have scored big this time. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-07-27

The Weapon is the second novel in Williamson's series about the Freehold War.  <br /> <br />The biggest difference between this book and Freehold is that in Freehold there are winners. In The Weapon, there are only survivors.

There is simply no sentimentality in this book. <br /> <br />Thomas Jefferson said, \\"The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time...\\" and Williamson explains in detail how that happens. <br /> <br />If you expect a happy ending, you will be disappointed.

Spencer is so matter-of-fact with the milieu that we are left with questions only after the story is over. Why is the ratio of women to men so skewed? How did these women create a society like this, with approximately early 19th century tech?  <br /> <br />Wen's writing is so good that you don't really start asking those questions while you are reading the book.

Once upon a time, there was a famous American statesman named Sam Houston, who was very badly injured at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. His life changed very much for the worse, and he failed at everything he tried, even with the friendship and patronage of Andrew Jackson. Finally, after living with the Cherokee and watching them be forced on the Trail of Tears, he went to Texas and immortality.  <br /> <br />Once upon a time, there was a writer of alternate history named Eric Flint, who decided that with one small change in history, he could plot a way around the Trail of Tears, the Mexican War and the Civil War. What was the change? Houston doesn't get as badly injured at Horseshoe Bend. <br /> <br />On this slender reed, Flint builds one of the best alternate histories ever written. Excruciatingly well researched, he picks real characters like Tiana Rogers (the Cherokee \\"princess\\" Houston married in the Original Time Line) and Andrew Jackson (who carried around a trunk full of general's hats so he could stomp on them when he got mad) and Major Ridge, one of the Cherokee leaders best known to the government in Washington. <br /> <br />Flint follows Houston to Washington, where he organizes the defense of the US Capitol against the British, and then to New Orleans, where he, and his sidekick Driscol (the Troll) figure importantly in the eponymous Battle. <br /> <br />This is the first of an alternate history series (at least a trilogy) which should take us well into the last half of the 19th century that might have been, had just one little thing been different. <br /> <br />Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit liked it, and well he should.

This actually makes for a better book, since Freer is well known for tightly plotted, spare writing while the first two volumes were classic BFF (big fat fantasy).  <br /> <br />What is very cool about this book is the way Freer simply drops us into the Milieu, without any explanation and avoids almost all infodumping throughout the book.  <br /> <br />Like the first two novels, it is interesting on a different level if you know enough Original Time Line history to figure out who some of the characters are, like Loyola and his original band of Jesuits in the first two books, or Khaireddin Barbarossa in this one. <br /> <br />Even if you don't know any history, and are reading this book on the level of fantasy, rather than alternate history (both of which it supports famously well) you'll find lots of depth. Freer weaves both the Beowulf and Hamlet stories together to make a real adventure that races like the rapids in a river to its startling conclusion. <br /> <br />Read this book. This is Dave Freer's real breakout solo novel, and he deserves a much wider following. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2005-06-30

For thirty years, Cally O'Neal has been the greatest assassin of the Bane Sidhe...the secret organization fighting against the Darhel's takeover of Earth after the Posleen War...and she's getting tired of it. Nearly dead tired. Even the benefits of Galactic medical technology can't give you back your soul. Julie Cochrane and John Ringo do a series of changes on the ways that even the good guys (or gals) are damaged by violence and war. The question is whether Cally will figure out some way to be saved, or if she is doomed to one day not care enough to survive that last mission. <br /> <br />Like many Baen collaborations, it is very hard to see where John leaves off and Julie begins. Once again, Baen has managed to bring out a newbie author with much more authority and voice than the average, by pairing her with a much more experienced author. <br /> <br />Waiting patiently for the next one. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes, Bananaslug at Baen's Bar	2004-10-26

First, it maintains the headlong pace and action of its three predecessors, but while doing so, and seemingly by accident (ha!), it sheds light on the varieties of experience of both humans and aliens. The alien Ontongard, the mutant Prime, the Pack, and the cult all are illuminated in the eye of experience by the new lead character, Ukiah's \\"brother\\" Atticus. Originally one body, Ukiah and Atticus were separated by a cleaver, and never reunited physically in time.  Atticus passes his \\"test\\" to become a Dog Warrior by showing his love for his partner Ru, and for his little brother Ukiah, in the same way that Ukiah passed his own test by loving his Moms and Max Bennett...and later, Indigo and his son. The novel is both structured and kaleidoscopic, and manages all of this with an effortless unpretentiousness that is the hallmark of the mature and superb novelist. I really liked the book, even though I was redshirted in it in a very messy way...after all I did volunteer. Go buy this book, so Wen will be asked to write more of them. <br /> <br />Walt Boyes <br />Editor-in-Chief <br />CONTROL Magazine	2004-10-13

Mad Mike Williamson followed a terrific first novel (Freehold) with a collaboration with John Ringo that is only so-so. It suffers from the old Hawaiian disease lakaeditin and should be about 100 pages shorter.  There was a terrific opportunity to delve further into the psychology and physiology of the Darhel, hereditary enemies (maybe) of humanity, aka the Elves, and it was a little disappointing to see how superficially Williamson and Ringo treated it. Overall, the book was good, just not up to Williamson or Ringo's previous best.	2004-07-28

First, it really doesn't read like the sequel it is...it can be read standalone quite well.  Second, it reads like a terrifically well realized alternate history, rather than another of the ubiquitous elves-dwarves-and-orcs fantasies we are inundated with.  Third, it actually has some closure at the end, so it isn't like certain other fantasy series which are apparently never going to go anywhere, and never end either.<br />Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint, and Dave Freer are a perfectly matched writing trio...and a tripod is the strongest seat.  They seamlessly craft this rich, colorful, and highly complex story, filled with historical in-jokes (Eneko Lopez and his friends are the original seven members of the Jesuit order) and even a few Baen Barfly in-jokes (&quot;It was enough to give Erik the mutters.&quot;)<br />Even the little, passing-through characters are very vividly realized, and are real people, not spearcarriers.  Spiro, the Corfiote fisherman, for example, and his buddy, Taki the fisher captain, are human beings caught in the flash of the story's eye.<br />I'm halfway through my third read of this book, and it is holding my attention so well that I have been sneaking off to read another couple of pages all day long.<br />This is what alternate worlds fantasy should be.  Kim Stanley Robinson, Harry Turtledove, and other practitioners, please take note.  This is the reigning champion of the field.<br />Walt Boyes	2003-12-22

What do you get?  You get creativity squared.  You get _Course of Empire_ by Eric Flint and K.D. Wentworth.<br />This book deserves nomination for the Hugo and Nebula awards. It is a deceptively old-fashioned plot: aliens conquer the Earth and what happens later.  But the aliens are real _people_ -- not human people, but people nonetheless...and not one-dimensional cutout villains.  The humans are real.  The aliens are real, and the situation is entirely believable.<br />Flint, while better known for alternate histories, began his writing career with the brilliant _Mother of Demons_ in which he created believable aliens out of giant landlocked squidlike beings...and got us to care about them and understand their motivations.<br />Wentworth, likewise, known for her fantasies, is the creator of the fascinating Hrinn...neither catlike, nor doglike, nor bearlike, but a warrior animal race, intelligent, emotional, honorable.  This book should be a breakthrough for Wentworth, who is amazingly underrated as an author...and deserves much better as she shows in _Course of Empire_.<br />Put together, Flint and Wentworth develop the Jao.  Very different than humans, human interactions baffle the Jao...just like the Jao baffle the humans who are their slaves.<br />This is an awe-inspiringly good book, and should be read and enjoyed, over and over.<br />Bravo!	2003-08-23

In this pocketsized volume, Ian Verhappen and Augusto Pereira have managed to clearly explain all the intricacies of understanding and working with Foundation Fieldbus.  Foundation Fieldbus is a growing means of transferring information directly from sensors to control systems and thence to the Manufacturing Execution System of the Enterprise.  More plants are using Foundation Fieldbus enabled sensors in both new construction and rehabilitation every year, and the technology is likely to have a longer than normal half-life in industrial networking.<br />Verhappen's clear prose, and lucid explanations make this book a really important starting-point for anybody who is trying to learn about Foundation Fieldbus.

In 1633, as in the previous volume 1632, Eric Flint and collaborator David Weber provide a slice of reality in an alternate universe.  People aren't cardboard, there are no achingly evil villains.  There are stupid people, people with warts, smart people, normal people...in short, all the people that make up 1633 in Europe.  Archvillains Richelieu and Simpson are revealed as men with passions, flaws and virtues.  Good guys are shown to be short-sighted and venal.  What we have here is a fine continuation of Eric Flint's experiment in \\"reality alternative history.\\"  Nobody pulls 2001 technology out of the bag...in fact, the climax leaves you with a clear (and foreboding) picture of the limits of Grantville's technology.<br />We are not reading Grantville uber alles here, nor are we reading a romp through the 17th century by those vastly superior persons, the Americans.  We are reading a well thought out dramatic essay on what happens when cultures collide.<br />The subtext of 1633 doesn't get in the way, but it is every bit as powerful subtext as any \\"literary\\" SF novel of the past 30 years.  We are seeing through a kaleidoscopic lens what happens when people are faced with massive change, and when people are forced to achieve beyond their station in life.  We are seeing what happens when a society comes into contact with another society with more toys and fancier philosophy.  Apply the lens of 1633 to the issue of the Native American, or the Australian Aborigine, and the philosophical subtext remains the same.<br />Flint and Weber do a masterful job of provoking thought from readers of space opera and action-adventure novels.  We are fed enough complex political analysis under the guise of character introspection that we can see exactly what is happening, and where things are going.<br />Finally, Flint and Weber pull off something extremelycritical, and they do it well: they make the indigenous population of the era, not the interlopers from Grantville, the heroes of the piece.<br />And that's the point. Or one of them.<br />Walt Boyes<BR>(the Bananaslug at Baen's Bar)	2002-08-05

I love historical novels, especially the really well researched and lushly written kind, like the late, and very much lamented Dame Dorothy Dunnett wrote, and I love science fiction, fantasy and alternate history.  Mercedes Lackey, Dave Freer and Eric Flint have managed to write an alternative historical fantasy about 16th century Venice.  So I got three of my favorites in one shot.<br />This novel is long.  But it never flags.  The pace is headlong, but the descriptions are clear, crisp and detailed.  And the characters are wonderful, especially the little people, the spearcarriers, and the supporting cast.<br />A case in point is the use of a certain Basque priest as a main supporting character.  It plays great without knowing who that character is based on, but it adds piquancy indeed to know that the character is really St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits.<br />The magic isn't intrusive where it shouldn't be, and is organic... that is, it doesn't just come from anywhere, and there are clear rules about how it works.<br />The magic isn't nearly as important to the plot as the convoluted and terrifyingly complex politics in the story.  Remember, this is the same part of Europe that was still reading Macchiavelli as a \\"How To\\" textbook.<br />I read snippets before publication, and I can't wait for the next one.  The collaboration of Lackey, Freer and Flint is greater than each of them alone.  And since Lackey and Flint are known for being extremely good on their own, and Freer is too, just not as well known, that's saying a lot.<br />Buy this book.

And this book is only a 4 star book in comparison with the previous one in this loose series, &quot;The Serpent's Shadow.&quot;  <br />While that book is a genuine 5 star masterpiece, &quot;The Gates of Sleep&quot; is a little jewel.  Don't let this confuse you.  It is quietly full of marvelous things, like the description of the faun at the shrine of Pan in the garden, or the description of Marina's bedroom frescoes.<br />This loose series of books is based on fairy tales...this one is Sleeping Beauty, the last one was Snow White, and the previous one to that was Beauty and the Beast.  But Lackey hasn't done a &quot;retelling&quot; rather she has written a terrific story using the plot of the fairy story.<br />The &quot;environmentalism&quot; in the story feels just a tad too &quot;modern&quot; to be Victorian England, and the character of Marina becomes a little too grown up a little too fast without fully developing her, and the ending is a bit abrupt, even though the fairy story is, too.<br />But these are minor quibbles, small kvetches.<br />The characters are drawn well, three-dimensional, and realistic, even the villains.<br />This book keeps Mercedes Lackey on my must-buy list.<br />Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar	2002-05-03

In this case, Mercedes Lackey decides to give us some backstory about the scapegrace Skif.  Skif becomes a Herald of Valdemar even though he isn't anything but a regulation, practicing thief.

Just as we see all that, somebody tries to kill Miles and Thorne disappears.<br />Once again, Bujold somehow manages to turn a very straightforward space opera into a serious discussion of the differences between people and cultures, the moral issues behind cloning and genetic research, and what wise leadership really is.<br />Bujold's novels have so many layers of meaning that it is absurd to call them space opera, yet there is plenty of action, and adventure.

In many ways better than Steve Sterling's Nantucket series, 1632 disguises a serious and thoughtful message about what makes Americans different, and why.  &quot;Millions for defense, not one cent for tribute!&quot; The rallying cry of a set of normal West Virginia mountain people, mostly coal miners, whose first reaction when they get plunked down in Thuringia in the midst of the 30 Years' War is to go to the aid of the country folk who are being ridden over, pillaged and raped by the mercenary armies who rampaged through Germany.  It is obvious why Flint picked 1632...because of the Battle of Lutzen, which, in the real time line, was the death of Gustavus Adolphus, and the last chance to unify Germany until the 1870's.  Yet Gustavus, King of Sweden, had already done what made the United States possible.  At Breitenfeld, by beating Tilly and the Empire, he had enshrined the principle of religious freedom such that the American Founders were able to write it into the Constitution with little or no dissent.  Women's Lib, democracy, and the American Revolution 150 years early, and in the middle of Germany...the ideas come fast and furious, and so does the action.  The attack of the Croats on the Grantsville High School is one of the best single pieces of action writing I've ever read.  Hurry up, Eric, and get 1633 and 1634 written.	2001-04-16

In Black On Black and Stars over Stars, Kathy Wentworth has done something that few SF writers can: she creates two races of highly believable aliens, the Hrinn and the Flek...and she explores the issues of the differences in the minds of humans and aliens.  Using Heyoka Blackeagle, the ultimate outsider, the Black on Black of Hrinn legend, who is raised as a Sioux warrior, and Mitsu, the human who is transformed against her will into a Flek hivemember, she explores what it is like to be human...and what it is like to be &quot;other.&quot;  The Hrinn are neither giant wolves or giant bears or giant wolverines...they are simply Hrinn.  Their culture and their personalities are clearly and carefully drawn.  So are the Flek, which Wentworth transforms from a faceless and remorseless enemy into a people, worthy of protection and defense.  This is a great read, as well as a deep well.	2001-04-15

In Black on Black, K. D. Wentworth brings us not one, but two new aliens: the Hrinn, and the Flek.  Astutely camoflaged as an action-adventure space opera, Black on Black is really a meditation and a fugue on the concept of &quot;other.&quot;  Heyoka, who is neither human nor Hrinn, faces a lifetime of otherness.  Raised by a consummate human outsider, a Sioux warrior, he tries to camoflage his otherness by joining the military...yet somehow, the fact that he is about 7 feet tall, with fangs and claws, and huge sharp teeth, and very black fur covering his entire body somehow keeps interfering with his desire to be considered fully human.  His journey of discovery to find his roots as Hrinn get him into more trouble than it is worth, yet somehow he manages to float through it without getting too involved....until, that is, his human partner, Mitsu, turns up missing and is found to be a brainwashed slave of the Flek...Hrinn versus Flek...two complete opposites as alien species.  The Flek, a hive species while the Hrinn are so individualistic they can hardly live with each other, let alone humans and Flek.  Heyoka is very well realized, and stops way short of becoming the invincible star-guided hero that most bad space opera provides.  He is a seven-foot-tall bag of insecurities and wants/needs/desires just like the rest of the universe.  Wentworth craftily disguises this metaphysical tractatus as a rip-roaring space opera, with plenty of action to disguise the thought pill.	2001-04-15

Schmitz wrote, and _I kept all the books_.  That put me one up (maybe even several up) on younger readers, or people who missed the tales of the Hub, with Telzey Amberdon, Trigger Argee, Dr. Mantelish and the other impossible to forget characters that populated Schmitz' worlds.  Now, the rest of you can enjoy what we did when they were published originally.  With minimal editing, Eric Flint and Jim Baen have created a labor of love, and a whacking good read!	2001-01-26

The story of the Liadens gets better and more varied and rich with every new book.  Buy this book.  Read this book. Then read it again. Bet you have to read it at least three times.	2001-01-26

The second book was not so great.  The third book was downright bad.  This one is simply poor.  There seems to be a trend recently in SciFI and Fantasy to write more and longer pieces regardless of quality, just to collect more royalties.  Unfortunately, this does not lend itself to good writing, and good writing is what science fiction and fantasy are about.	2001-01-04

It reminds me very much, in terms of quality, of David Brin's early work, and Roger Zelazny, and Robert Heinlein and people like that.  <br />The writing style is a bit uneven, as you should expect for a first novel,  and you can see where Ringo got better as he went along, but by the end, it got very very good indeed.  Ringo has succeeded in setting a really high bar for yourself for the next one!<br />This is definitely a getter and a keeper and a re-reader!	2000-10-18

Eli Goldratt's \\"The Goal\\" isn't really a novel even though it is disguised as one.  What it is, is a serious philosophical treatise on a radical business theory called \\"Theory of Constraints\\".  Goldratt originally wrote the book in the late '80's and it has become a cult classic in b-schools, and especially on the plant floor.     If you are seriously interested in the way companies \\"should\\" work in the 21st century, you must read this book...and be sure you \\"get\\" it.  It is on my short list of books I'd want to be locked into the plant with, along with \\"In Search Of Excellence\\" and \\"High Probability Selling\\".  What is the link?  All three books are paradigm-breakers, and new-paradigm-creators.      Read the book.  Make your business work better.  Make more money.	1996-12-26
