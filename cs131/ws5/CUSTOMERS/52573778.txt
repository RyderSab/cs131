US	52573778	R233XIWDHHZDLJ	0758209118	853314942	The Brothers Bishop	Books	5	73	82	N	Y	I hate being speechless.	This book really should have been marked as being a bit scandalous.  There is intercourse with minors, incest, multiple attempted suicides, the list goes on.  A lesser author would dredge up the most obvious emotions and the associated trite characterizations of the seemingly typical damaged characters and clobber us with a storyline that reeks with the familiar \\"I can tell which heart string he's going to pull on next\\".<br /><br />If you've not yet read Leave Myself Behind (I have lent out and purchased at least 4 copies thus far) then you might not realize that Bart Yates is not a lesser author, and that buying and experiencing this book is really something you'll want to thank him for making possible.<br /><br />He takes emotionally wrenching subject matter and mixes it with characters that should be easily predictable and transparent and turns them into these simple yet epic portrayals of the intricacy of the human condition, and it's amazing to read.  He certainly does put most, if not all, of his characters through hell and back before allowing them a bit of redemption, but as with most of the rewarding things in life, the journey is a hell of a lot more important than the destination.<br /><br />I fully suggest setting aside however much time you'll need to get through it in one sitting - and if you haven't yet read Leave Myself Behind, have it at the ready for when you finish.	2005-07-21

Kramer, famous for not holding back even a microscopic amount of vitriol, is doing what I have long been wanting to see - he's takin' the gays to task for their behavior, both past and present, and the lack of leadership in the gay community.<br /><br />My favorite anti-Kramer argument has already surfaced - that he should shut up because he's giving right-wingers ammunition in their fight against us.  Right. They certainly couldn't go into any gay bar, log on to any gay website or even talk to Joe Gay and figure out for themselves that the gay 'community' is adrift in a sea of narcissistic, hedonistic and ultimately self-destructive behavior.  We do such a good job of keeping that all under wraps, right?  If it weren't for him tellin' tales out of school, we'd look like angels to the rest of the world, right?  Right.<br /><br />Larry Kramer may not have oodles of tact or the best ability to persuade without beating people over the head while screaming at them, but his argument is based largely upon his belief that there is no more time left to be polite.  He argues (correctly, in my opinion) that gay men are too immature to police themselves.  Drug abuse is skyrocketing, apathy about AIDS has led to a spike in unsafe sex and rampant transmission of STD's - and not just HIV - and politically we are weaker now than we ever were before the dawn of Will & Grace and Ellen.<br /><br />What's the disconnect?  I would think it's probably that there is a large portion of the gay community that feels like we've already 'arrived' from a civil rights perspective.  Gay bashing is down, most people haven't gotten fired or been kicked out of a home because of their sexuality.  It's exacerbated by the fact that the emotional maturity of the average gay man is in the toilet.  We loathe ourselves, and we loathe each other.<br /><br />Perhaps my experience in life is unique, but I've never seen a straight person be as inherently evil or ostracizing as the gays are to each other.  We judge each other based on completely irrelevant and superficial criteria, we alienate based on looks, age, genitalia, income and a host of other things that have absolutely nothing to do with who we are as people.  But when criticized from the outside, we lash out and tell those who disagree with us that they had damn well better love us unconditionally and not judge.  Hypocrisy?<br /><br />I applaud Mr. Kramer - not necessarily because of the things he has to say, but because he has the courage to say them.  He is essentially holding up a mirror and forcing the gay men of today to look into it - it's not his fault we don't like what we see.  I hope that once the collective masses stop whining about being judged, they'll actually sit back and think, realizing that as a community we are actually moving backwards in our quest for equality, and we're hurting ourselves and each other in the process at unprecedented levels./>Perhaps my experience in life is unique, but I've never seen a straight person be as inherently evil or ostracizing as the gays are to each other.

Mr. Kluger has a natural sense of comic timing and wit, without being excessively catty or bitchy in the process.  While I would have liked a bit more at the end of the book (after so much buildup, it felt rushed) the journey with the characters was well worth the somewhat stilted ending.<br /><br />If it's any help, after reading this, my first Kluger novel, I bought the rest of his catalog on Amazon.

True, it focuses on empowering women to say \\"Hey, I'm worth more than this and I'm not going to settle\\" which is a wonderful thing to realize, but it really goes beyond relationships.  We are conditioned to work hard (and, as an unfortunate side effect, suffer) for everything in life - jobs, material possessions, etc - and when love or money or other things we want don't come to us, it's easier emotionally to justify and/or make excuses as to why we're not getting what we feel we deserve when we want it.  Whether it's the attention of a man (or woman) or a promotion at work, the power of this book is that it tells you in no uncertain terms that YOU are the only one who will suffer if you continue to cling to something that wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />The authors have really stumbled on to something good here - what I took away from this book and will continue to remember is that life is too short to pine for things that aren't meant to happen.  Who knows how many great things pass us by because we're too busy worrying about getting something or someone that just wasn't meant to be.  Read it and weep, if you must, but then also be glad that - if you apply what you've learned and make it your mantra - it's the last time you will cry over a love or aspiration unrealized.	2004-09-25

Cute and young enough to possibly make up for not being TOTALLY hot, Toby, the main character, seems to do nothing but screw up opportunities to 'elevate' himself to the A-list in a snotty, screwed-up New York of the new millenium.<br />The beauty of this book, though, is that like Sex & the City  and Less than Zero - two books this one has been likened to - it has nothing to do with New York or snotty A-lister's or even young almost-hot men.. rather, it's a story about a person coming of age in a time where everything seems possible, everything seems desirable.  His Toby, however, is not unlike the rest of us: he wants to be successful, he wants to find love, and he wants to maintain his sense of self but has to do so in spite of horrible bosses, frenemies (the one Sex and the City reference that fits - the episode where friends act like enemies) and a bank account hovering just above zero.<br />The approachability and enjoyability of this novel is not based on the fact that it's glitzy or set in New York or filled with drama and scandal - that has been done, to varying levels of success, by other authors.  What made this book so enjoyable was the fact that the main character was real, honest about his vanities and shortcomings, and in the end decided that being a good person and doing the right thing for his friends, family and self, brought him the happiness that everything else had not.<br />(Side note: for those of you who read and enjoyed Bart Yates' \\"Leave Myself Behind,\\" the main character in this book reminds me of a grown up \\"Noah\\" - and the fact that Mr. Yates endorses the book on the dust cover should persuade you to read the book!)the book on the dust cover should persuade you to read the book!)	2004-06-01

As a very frequent business and personal traveler, I've seen many of the &quot;nightmare&quot; passengers described with such wit and humor by Mr. Hester.<br />It's always amazing to me how flight attendants are frequently treated like sub-humans by passengers, and how many people seem to lose all sense of tact and personal dignity once their boarding pass is taken.  Having witnessed air rage, carry-on's the size of Texas, drunks, brawls and a million other human failings, reading Mr. Hester's flight attendant perspective confirmed what I've always suspected - they deal with a LOT, they're in a thankless position, and they're never appreciated until some heavy turbulence hits.<br />HIGHLY recommended, whether you're a frequent traveler or not - the humor is universal.	2003-07-24

It's funny to me that most of the \\"reviews\\" on here have absolutely nothing to do with the book BEING reviewed, but a review of the subject's character.  They're not selling Hillary Clinton on Amazon, they're selling a book.<br />That said, I enjoyed the book.  I am a registered independent (since that seems to matter so much in these reviews, that pesky political affiliation) so I purchased and read the book to learn more about Hillary and yes, I'll admit, to hear a bit of what was going through her mind as the Lewinsky scandal unfolded and lasted for what seemed like an eternity.<br />I found her personal history interesting, the writing style fairly informal and personal, and the overall background to be thorough.  Nobody, in ANY biography or memoir, is going to air every piece of dirty laundry or drag out all of skeletons in their closet - would you?  I wasn't expecting her to bare all for an increasingly (and annoyingly) insatiable public need (or as it would seem to some, God-given right) to know all of the salacious details of those who live in the public eye.  That said, I learned a lot about her and enjoyed doing so.<br />For those who did not actually READ the book, and who just hate her and want to trash her, it's a shame that Amazon posts your \\"reviews\\" because they do nothing to help those who are interested in reading.  Why not do the common sense thing and just stay away from the book ?  It IS just a book, right?	2003-06-13

How many times have you lost sleep stressing over something beyond your control?  How many times has someone looked at you and told you you looked like you needed a vacation?<br />I was fortunate enough to see this book and its author on Oprah a week ago and immediately purchased the book.  I recently started a dedicated fitness and nutrition program (in the past 6 months) and this book was a perfect compliment to it.  The key message here is that you cannot \\"perform\\" successfully in any aspect of your life if you do not direct positive energy towards it, and you WILL burn out if you don't make time to walk away and relax.  On the same hand, if you direct your energy towards negative things (worrying, office gossip, paranoia) those things will \\"grow\\" and continue to envelop you and distract you from those things that are positive and desired.<br />I'm recommending that we implement key principles from this book into my company's management development initiatives (go to the author's website linked here on Amazon for more details) as I think it's a good supplement to our time management training and helps direct managers and employees towards a balance in their work, their personal lives and the goals and objectives they want to achieve successfully in both areas.	2003-06-12

My only major gripe was that the \\"I'm gay, everyone's gay!\\" approach to the main characters was a bit too easy.. and the initial meeting of the main character and the jock in a chat room was rather implausible, (if you're a terribly closeted jock, why would you go meet someone who goes to your own high school 5 minutes into a chatroom conversation?) but nonetheless it was a cute, light, easy-to-read story.<br />Also recommend Bart Yates' \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" ..	2003-06-12

As Noah comes to terms with his father's death, his sexuality, his mother's mental illness and the intolerance of his peers, we are treated to his witty and highly insightful interpretations of what it means to be a human being in a complicated world.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough - it's well-written, has deep and richly-drawn characters, and a main character that will keep you engaged as he goes on his journey of being a boy yet becoming a man.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.	2003-05-11

The author pulls characters from his first novel and develops them in more detail here, while introducing colorful new ones to add to the story.  While the naming of some of the characters is a bit 80's soap opera (Blythe, Blaine, etc) they're all fully-developed and unique.<br />My only beef with the book is the cover - why cheapen the content of EVERY gay novel by insinuating you need a buttshot or a half-naked model on the cover?  Made it interesting to take on the plane with me..<br />That aside, this is a charming story, mostly realistic, and just a fun book to read.

Imagine the average level of homophobic jerks on the playground in school and multiply it by 1000 and you may have the idea of what it must be like to go through life as a gay man in our completely heterosexualized sporting environment.<br />I've read a number of articles written about and by Billy in the last few years, and was hoping that one day he would put it all into a book.  Thankfully, he has.  You can never get too much inspiration or encouragement, and even for those of us already out of the closet, it's an affirming story that reminds us why we did it in the first place.<br />Highly recommended.<br />(May also want to check out \\"Becoming a Man\\" - the autobiography of famed gay fiction/poetry writer Paul Monette.)	2003-04-21

This, in addition to the standard walk-through make the guide a great value.

This, however, wasn't one of those stories for me.<br />Don't get me wrong - all of the elements are here.  But they just didn't work for me in this book the way they have in the past.  Perhaps the biggest problem is that the 'underdog' in this story goes from principled, appropriately-struggling lawyer in public service to private practice ...in the space of about 10 pages.  Morals vanish, clients are sold down the river, and money starts flying to such an extreme that it's almost difficult to read.<br />I guess the one thing I've always liked about Grisham's books is that no matter what the temptation, his main characters have stayed above the board, but in this book, he goes south with the first check in hand.<br />Perhaps the that's the whole point?  While many have said that this is a scathing indictment of the tort / class action climate of today, it was more an indictment (in my mind) of personal morality and its fragility when money is involved.	2003-02-23

Since the flight's about 2 hours long, I either read REALLY fast, or it was a bit light on content.<br />Either way, the story IS very similar in nature to Christian McLaughlin's \\"Glamourpuss\\" but definitely focused a lot more on anger and defeat.  The main character is supposedly beautiful enough on the outside to land a job anchoring a TV show but is then relegated to behind-the-scenes work only when it's discovered that he's gay.  The rest of the story is basically the show's managers screwing him over, and him making a whole lotta stupid decisions instead of (I know this is a stretch) quitting?<br />Overall, the book was well-written, but the story was a disappointment.  It's a bit hard to sympathize with a main character who seems so clueless about everything from his personal and physical appearance (like there's such a thing as a gay man living in West Hollywood who is completely unaware of how to use his looks.. right!) to the politics and superficiality of Hollywood.<br />This is about the 5th fiction book I've read about gay men and Hollywood/Showbiz, and it'll be my last..

I can go either way - the pictures are fun, but it's kind of like pictures of food at McDonalds - the 'real' end product often looks nothing like it, but tastes fine either way.<br />That said, this book is filled with valuable recipes and bundles them together into full meals.  If you're looking for a single recipe, the index has them all, but I really like that she makes recommendations for dishes that go well together and have gone over well in her own cooking experience.<br />You'll likely find yourself reading the book leisurely, which is exactly the intent - take your time, enjoy the process, and have a great time in the kitchen!<br />(If you must have pix - &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; and &quot;How to Be a Domestic Goddess&quot; have plenty!)	2003-01-02

I don't expect to be reading North & South when I pick up a book that has almost-naked men on the cover, but come on.. the TV show in the story is constantly on the brink of disaster, and so is this book.<br />I'm disappointed that the best this author could do with this story is regurgitate stereotypes, have HORRID, trite dialogue and story lines (i.e. characters who go from straight to gay in less than a paragraph) and an acid-tongued protagonist who lacks talent for anything other than swapping one-liners with the boss' daughter.

While the premise could have been anything, I think the author did a good job of fleshing out some issues that are real to many of us - changing careers, transitioning from the end of one relationship to the beginning of a new one, etc.<br />My major disappointments in the book were some of the plot choices (the token AIDS carrier, the snappy/bitchy dialogue and one-liners) and the cheeseball expression of love between the main character and his love interest. The only gay author I've ever read who was able to capture the expression of love between two fictional characters is Joseph Olshan in \\"The Nightswimmer\\" - the scene in this novel is, again, somewhat trite and cavity-inducing.<br />Either way, I did enjoy this book and look forward to the author's further literary exploits.

Mr. Rice is clearly still developing his story-telling skills and character development ideas, but this book was much better in terms of both than his first.  He has a clear sense of suspense building and plot twists (some of them are a bit much to swallow) .. and while I did get somewhat bored in the course of reading the book, I never lost interest.<br />It's awesome to see someone so young be so capable at writing and showing an interest in it.

It's apparently supposed to be romance, but the dialogue was so cheesy and the chapters so short that it lost my interest almost immediately.<br />Stick to writing good suspense novels and murder mysteries, and leave the tacky romance novels to Judith Krantz.	2002-06-24
US	52573778	R3IY50AL020IVA	0140280650	800942881	Edge of Glory: The Inside Story of the Quest for Figure Skating's Olympic Gold Medals	Books	3	5	12	N	Y	A bit too tabloid for my tastes...	While the author does an excellent job of portraying the sport of amateur figure skating's \\"darker\\" side, it comes across as a bit too gratuitously scandalous in many parts.<br />The few key things I did take away from this book were that:<br />1.  Tara Lipinksi and her clan were clearly not liked by the author, as almost the whole book focused on her and her mother's tantrums, plots to dethrone Michelle Kwan, and to win a gold medal at the '98 Olympics (and the associated ca$h compensation)<br />2.  There is so much more to figure skating than most of the world sees, as most of the world doesn't track the comings and goings of figure skatings biggest competitors in non-Olympic years.<br />3.  Tara [messed] up bigtime by going Pro - when was the last time you saw/heard from her?<br />4.  I prefer gold medalists who are humbled by their achievements and who continue to grow and develop, both as athletes and ambassadors of the sport.. not people who use their medals as coupons to redeem for a life of quick cash and an even quicker disappearance.<br />That Michelle Kwan is the most enduring ladies' competitor in decades goes without saying - though the author seemed to feel she had to prove it - but Michelle has done that herself.  If this tale of the road to the '98 Olympics shows anything, is that while drama and rivalry (and questionable judging) dominate the sport, it's the same drama and rivalry that makes figure skating so compelling to watch from a fan's perspective.	2002-06-10

What makes a good author, in my opinion, is his or her ability to capture the human condition in such a way that it comes across as real.<br />What makes a good comedian, again in my opinion, is to take slices of ordinary life and see the humor in them.  Mr. Smith is clearly capable in both areas.  While he's not the only person (let alone gay one) to see a relationship end, his ability to harness all of the involved elements (the concerned family, division of the utensils, joint custody of mutual friends and the eventual return to the single's scene) and make them both funny and touching.<br />It may not be as funny if you can't \\"relate\\" .. but for anyone who has ever addressed and gotten through a painful situation through humor, this book is a treat.	2002-06-10
US	52573778	R1TQEMMM07YC8T	0316969680	540414996	The Beach House	Books	4	40	51	N	N	Co-Authoring suits Mr. Patterson	Not that he's not a competent writer of great murder mysteries in his own right, of course.<br />The formula of this book is no different than any other by this author or any in the genre.  Someone's murdered, someone's going to investigate it, the person investigating it is going to have an edgy flirtation with the person who comes along to help with the investigation (usually a cop or PI) and using creative and completely illegal means, the original crime will be solved.<br />In this case, the victim is the brother of the main character, the \\"bad guy\\" is richer than words can describe, the love interest a female PI, and, as always, the police are inept and can't see a crime where one exists.<br />It's all about as formulaic as most of the reviews (seriously - how many book endings have literally \\"shocked\\" you?) but it's what Patterson does best.  I've found these are great books to read on flights and while waiting in airports - great way to capture your attention, kill a few hours of time, and enjoy a storyteller's ability to draw you into their world where good eventually wins.	2002-06-10
US	52573778	ROU19BE4HITR	1555835856	123958089	Murder in the Rue Dauphine: A Mystery	Books	3	5	11	N	Y	Entertaining but fairly forgettable	I've read lots of gay fiction over the past few years, but have never really read any gay mystery fiction.  I had suspected that it would be the same as \\"straight mystery fiction\\" with gym memberships, club music and more money involved.<br />I wasn't wrong.<br />In this book, the main character is your typical, jaded and quip-ridden gay man in his 30's.  Naturally, he has a great body, enough money in the bank to 'kind-of' work and plenty of time to meet other guys with great bodies in his gym.<br />The annoyingly-typical main character aside, the story itself is entertaining and somewhat of a cliffhanger.  The author, however, does a bit too much foreshadowing in a key point in the story and makes it easy from there on to figure out who the bad guy is.<br />The author does a good job of storytelling, but a number of the sub-plots (the main character's boyfriend-or-not who never actually plays a relevant role gets way too much page time) are a bit distracting.<br />This is a good book to take to the beach but one that will fade from memory soon after finished.  We'll see what his next book is like..	2002-04-15

Robbie Williams.<br />Ok, I probably review way too many RW items on Amazon, but he is truly a unique talent and someone I wish was more popular in the US.  His talent and unique blend of pop/rock & R&B influences and is such a nice break from formatted pre-teen pop.<br />That said, this book is no less interesting than the music.  Robbie is not afraid to let it all show, for good or for bad.  He openly admits to having demons that other artists spend a fortune trying to hide from the media behind a wall of publicist double-talk and blatant lies.<br />There is a movie version of this out in the UK at the moment, and I'm hoping that it will at least make it to Canada on DVD so that those of us fans stateside can purchase a copy.  I highly recommend this book if you're a fan and want to get to know more about RW.	2002-04-02

I bought this book after many trips to the UK as kind of a joke between myself and British friend.  Since we're always laughing at the other's interpretation of the English language, I thought it would be funny.<br />And indeed, parts of it were.  But for the most part, the phrases and words that were &quot;translated&quot; were of little importance.<br />If you're looking for a strict, current translation of words as they are used in the UK and the US, you should probably dig a little deeper.  If you want to read a book that has a few useful phrases and interpretations of various sayings, along with some humorous snafus the author has experienced over the years, this would do fine.	2001-11-02
US	52573778	R22WLQMY297KYO	1575667665	482430686	Any Kind Of Luck	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Cute, funny, cliche.	Having never heard of this author but having read the reviews of the book, I figured I'd squeeze in one more fluff summer read before the weather turns cold and my reading more introspective.<br />I was not disappointed.  For anyone who has enjoyed books by Robert Rodi, Doug Guinan, or the other &quot;Gay Light&quot; authors, this book is a must-have.  Anyone can imagine the humor of two gay men who move from the ultimate chic locale (NYC) to hick Texas - it's a given.<br />There's plenty of camp, plenty of humor, a bit of preaching thrown in (how could a queen from NYC move to the sticks in TX and NOT preach?) and a colorful cast of characters.. all in all a very enjoyable book.  Look forward to next summer - hopefully Mr. Sibley will have another one out in time!	2001-09-02
US	52573778	R3E79IKHXTR1LZ	0312263031	543338950	The Coming Storm	Books	3	2	4	N	Y	Not quite &quot;A Separate Peace&quot;	The author is quite blatantly influenced by &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; - enough so to mention it quite a few times in the text of this novel.<br />While I did enjoy the book, I felt in parts that the writing was tedious - must every thought and every action of every character be pondered and analyzed to the death? I ended up skipping over many paragraphs just because I didn't want to read a 100-word character reaction to another character saying something as innane as &quot;That's odd.&quot; There are quite a few characters in the book that seem to be headed towards full development (Libby, Claire, etc) then suddenly drop off to nowhere, leaving their personal stories incomplete.  That aside, the story is good and the words vibrant.<br />The story, which primarily revolves around a troubled 15 yr old student falls in love with his 25 year old teacher, is interesting.. you can feel the aching emotion of the characters embroiled in a relationship that is both illicit and doomed to fail. How do you walk away from loving someone you aren't supposed to love?<br />All in all, Mr. Russell is a good storyteller.. a few too many run-on plot developments (that go nowhere) but a vivid imagination and a gift for telling a story so completely that you feel as if you are in the world he's painted.	2001-09-02
US	52573778	R1J7WJKYSMK62E	0425176614	868907229	Nightswimmer	Books	5	13	14	N	Y	My favorite gay fiction book ever.	Nightswimmer was actually the very first item I'd ever written a review for here at Amazon. I don't know what ever happened to it, but the book remains my favorite of all the gay fiction books I've ever read. Most gay fiction centers around name brands, a-list stars and a-list cities, lots of gossip and overblown scandals/dramas. While those books are fun to toss in the beach bag on a nice summer day, Olshan created a story that hits much closer to home in the lives of many gay men. He writes about relationships in a palpable way - love, love lost, and love found again. It's really neither gay nor straight, but an exploration of how gay men in particular tend to cling to relationships of the past, leaving pieces of themselves behind until they have the chance to reclaim them in finding new love. He does not glamourize his characters nor does he attempt to apologize for their flaws or shortcomings. They are who they are, and they are well-crafted and quite realistic.  The haunting melancholy of the past and the trepidation the main character, Will, has about his future is beautifully written and the story remains a favorite of all the friends I've loaned this fine book to - get it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.	2001-08-25

So what exactly drives the requirements of a summer novel?  Not too deep?  Gone from memory once the book is closed?<br />Well, both apply here.  The author is indeed a good storyteller, but the formula of the gay summer novel has been done ad nauseum, and this book doesn't add anything fresh to the mix.<br />There will always be celebrity names, there will always be hot guys, there will always be a scandal, and the main character will always triumph with minor struggle/wind damage endured.<br />The author is well aware of the formula, and writes one of the better stories I've seen while using it, but little separates it from the work of Doug Guinan et al.<br />Best advice: buy it used, then recycle accordingly.	2001-08-09
US	52573778	R2UPULGLWIPLS9	1575668459	356579320	Can't Buy Me Love	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Great Debut novel	Chris Kenry has an easy-to-read style and is obviously a keen observer of gay life in the new millenium.  While some of the characterizations he makes through the cast of his story are a bit cliche, they work, and you end up hoping that things turn out for the best for the group.<br />Kenry has a quick wit, and this book is a fine summer read.  Check out other books by Christian McLaughlin and Robert Rodi for some equally enjoyable summer fare, but don't pass this book up - it's a great first novel and a fine addition to the gay comedrama author aresenal. :)	2001-07-24
