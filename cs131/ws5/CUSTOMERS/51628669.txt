There's quite a bit of information here with 15 chapters and over 230 pages. The game starts out quietly in the Giuoco Piano with 1 e4 e5, 2 Nf3 Nc6, 3 Bc4 Bc5 then BAM!! 4 b4!?. This unprotected pawn thrust attacks Black's bishop begging to be captured in order to open up lines of attack. All the greats have played it since the 19th century. The book also shows variations where Black declines the free pawn. In the right hands The Evans Gambit can be a dangerous weapon. <br />If you plan on taking up this opening, I'd also suggest becoming familiar with The Two Knights Defence (Black plays 3...Nf6 instead of Bc5). White can play 4 Ng5 with a double attack on Black's f7 pawn or employ the Max Lange Attack (4 d4). All 3 variations are fun to play. Who says the Giuoco Piano has to be boring?	2001-04-07

I've seen a few others that weren't so clear. Contains 70 *complete* games of Master play. None of this &quot;White to move with advantage&quot; nonsense (except when offering possible alternatives to the game at hand). Sokolov advocates for White 4.Qc2 when facing the Nimzo-Indian Defence and explains Black's 3 major alternatives in detail along with 2 minor alternatives that occasionally show up. I played through some of the games and i must say the level of tactical and positional themes are quite dynamic. The book has renewed my interest in playing the Nimzo-Indian for both sides.	2001-04-07

Granted, the 1.e4 player can face numerous responses which need to be addressed. The majority of those responses are represented here, but often times after a few moves the analysis ends with &quot;and White is better&quot;. Do tell? You'd have to be at least a strong intermediate to even know why that would be so. My advice for those seeking help with 1.e4 (or with any opening move) would be to purchase Modern Chess Openings (MCO 13 or 14), go over the openings that interest you, and write down the moves in your games against your opponents. That way you will know the types of responses you will face in general to your opening move. Then you can find a more specialized book to combat your opponents defenses and still have MCO to study. I would also suggest Aaron Summerscale's *A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire*. It uses 1.d4 systems and is much easier to digest and actually lives up to it's name. This book ***Startlingly*** does not.	2001-04-07

The most common reply i have run across is 1...e5 which gives White a Sicilian Reversed, so all you Sicilian fans out there might enjoy using the same ideas on the White side of the board. The book covers Irregular Variations, The Dragon, the Normal Sicilian, Three Knights Variation and the Closed Sicilian Reversed. There's also chapters on facing a Grunfeld Defence without the use of d4, avoiding the Nimzo-Indian Defence and Symmetrical English systems including the Hedgehog. I've never encountered 1.c4 c5 though. Seems like a boring choice for Black. Overall, plenty of information to introduce this line of play.	2001-03-31

Instead of going into the more well-trodden paths, surprise your opponents as early as move 3.

Garry Kasparov has added a lot new tactical ideas which author Gary Lane points out. There are 4 main systems covered in 15 chapters. The only thing missing is The Goring Gambit. Also a good way to prepare for the lines as Black in case your opponent tries to sneak this one in on you.	2001-03-31

All games are complete or with Black resigning with Mate soon to follow. To this day i get disappointed if an Opening Chess book doesn't have at least SOME complete games. I have a small minority that have no complete games and to me that's a shame. This book won't teach a lot of opening theory, but it will expose the beginner/novice to numerous openings. It's instructional for all concerning possible piece sacrifices and various traps. The 9 chapters are very well organized. I find it very helpful if variations or move orders are included in reviews before buying. Since there are so many variations i'll list them but won't include move orders.

I couldn't find anything locally, so i ordered over the internet even though  there were no reviews for it. I got the opposite of what i was looking for  however: practically every main variation of the Declined systems (1.d4 d5,  2.c4 e6) and Slav (2.c4 c6), but nothing on how to readily take advantage  of 1.d4 d5, 2.c4 dxc4 with the lesser player as Black attempting to hold  onto the proffered pawn. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book with over  360 pages of material. It's helpful to both sides who get involved with the  Declined and Slav systems. I rarely saw those lines however when i bought  the book around 4 years ago because i was facing 'coffee house' players for  the most part and i wasn't looking to play those variations as Black  either, as it didn't appeal to me. What i needed at the time was a way to  punish Black for accepting the Gambit and setting up an a6 and b5 pawn  structure, attempting to hold on to the extra pawn. Also a way as Black to  play the Accepted variation, how to know when to give the pawn back, while  developing correctly and letting my natural ability win. So if you're  looking for symmetrical Queen's pawn systems that are closed or 'stodgy' as  one writer wrote concerning the Queen's Gambit Declined or Slav, i do  recommend this book if you can't find anything more recent.<br />I've taken up  the task recently of offering reviews for all the Chess books i've amassed  for this very reason: to let the unwary know what exactly they are getting  before making a purchase over the internet. This was a... mistake that  i had made, even though at some point i would become interested in what  this book had to offer. My position now is to NEVER purchase a book over  the internet unless it has some form of review, unless the title is much  more descriptive and i've researched it a little better using Modern Chess  Openings or Batsford Chess Openings. I don't know what the ratio is for  strong club players who know exactly what they're looking for compared to  the beginner or novice who needs a little advice that visit Amazon looking  for Chess books, i can only relate my experiences and i'm sure there are a  few out there who could use this practical advice before spending their  hard earned money.g Modern Chess  Openings or Batsford Chess Openings.

I've also enjoyed many of the  Pergamon Chess series books from the early 1990's period. Always an  interesting read, these books are some of the most enjoyable i've come  acorss. This book goes into many historical games and analytical exercises  as early as the manuscripts of the late 15th century to the late 18th  century (Lucena, Damiano, Greco, Del Rio, Ponziani) and many famous games  from such figures as Alekhine, Benko, Blackburne, Capablanca, Chigorin,  Euwe, Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov, Keres, La Bourdonnais, Lasker, Morphy,  Najdorf, Petroff, Petrosian, Pillsbury, Reti, Samisch, Smyslov, Spassky,  Steinitz, Tal, Tarrasch, Tartakower, Torre, Uhlmann and Zukertort.<br />The  Aim of the Sacrifice, In the Opening-Middlegame-Endgame, Not Just a Queen,  The Path to the Goal, Logical Outcome or Chance Happening, Calculation and  Evaluation, Positional Sacrifice and Classical Heritage are the main themes  discussed with many sub-themes. There's also a test chapter at the end  called It's Your Move.<br />Pretty nice book and always good to go back to if  you feel your game needs some slight tweaking.	2000-08-27
US	51628669	RG5PXXBR5MQHP	080503286X	977097048	New Ideas in the Nimzo-Indian Defence (Batsford Chess Library)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Very Nicely Done	This 267 page volume published in 1994 is one of Kosten's finest works. It  probably would be best though to get a more general work on the  Nimzo-Indian before embarking on this one. The move order (1.d4 Nf6, 2.c4  e6, 3.Nc3 Bb4) is easy to understand and allows Black quick development.  Invariably White is either saddled with 2 c pawns after Bxc3 bxc3 or if  White chooses an early Qc2, the White Queen captures at c3, but this slows  down White's development since he has made 2 Queen moves so early. One word  of caution though. White decides on Move 3 if he will allow the  Nimzo-Indian to be played by Black, or instead choosing 3.Nf3 which usually  leads to the Queen's Indian defence (3.Nf3 b6). You really need both in  your opening repertoire as Black if you're not a King's Indian or Grunfeld  defence player (2.c4 g6). Of course if you're really ambitious you could  try the Blumenfeld Gambit if White offers 3.Nf3 (3...c5, 4.d5 b5!?) but  it's hard to find deeply analyzed material on that. Needless to say, the  semi-serious to serious chess player needs to know this defence as Black  against the Queen's pawn player. I would also suggest a book on the Benoni  defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5, 3.d5 e6) and the Benko Gambit (3.d5 b5).	2000-08-26

I haven't given  the book a true reading yet however, but i did skim the pages and read some  of the more interesting parts. I can clearly see that this book has a lot  of valuable information for the player who wishes to advance to higher  levels of play. I think the main reason i haven't sat down, read and played  the examples given is the fact move orders are given in the old descriptive  notation. It can be rather tedious and i tire quickly from it. I find the  standard algebraic notation of today much easier to use. So, in essence, i  would suggest getting the 21st Century edition. It's a 5 star book but i  dropped it to 4 because of the old style being used, which i'm sure the  1979 edition uses as well.	2000-08-26

There is a bonus however, in that the Modern defence is  also addressed. The Pirc defence (1.e4 d6, 2.d4 Nf6, 3.Nc3 g6, 4.Nf3 Bg7)  is a close relation to the King's Indian defence, the only difference being  White has played e4 instead of c4. The game can also transpose to the Pirc  if 1.d4 d6 and White chooses 2.e4 instead of 2.c4 but it would be a good  idea to have another system available if e4 is not forthcoming. Black's  idea is to have White establish a pawn centre with the idea of rapidly  undermining it, creating an unbalanced position and exciting play. The  Modern defence (1.e4 g6, 2.d4 Bg7) can also lead back to the Pirc, but  that's not set in stone. The Modern defence can lead to it's own set of  complications for both sides. Overall, it's a good book to have, especially  if you're a King's pawn player and have to face Pirc or Modern defence  players and you need some general theory and positional understanding.	2000-08-26

It  seemed a novelty that i would encounter every blue moon. It also had a  reputation as being drawish. However, my style the last few years has been  to throw something at my opponent he doesn't quite fully understand and  dictating how the opening proceeds. I know i didn't have a real clue as to  what would happen when facing the Petroff. I also have a used copy of  Winning With the Petroff by Anatoly Karpov. If Karpov has success with the  Petroff and endorses it, it must be sound. You can almost be guarenteed an  exciting open game while maintaining a solid position. If you're tired of  the same old Ruy Lopez or Guioco Piano as Black, or prefer a more open  position than what the Philidor defence offers (2.Nf3 d6) and prefer  answering 1.e4 with 1...e5, then this is the book for you.	2000-08-26

It's the  only reason i decided to take up the game again with a more serious  attitude. That being said, no matter how well you know your opening or  whatever your favorite openings are, without proper use of your pawns, it  can all go for naught. What's also important is at least having a basic  understanding of pawn structures in openings you're NOT familiar with that  your opponent may offer. Even though losing a pawn isn't the end of the  world, i've always prided myself on getting that small amount of material  then riding my extra pawn to a winning endgame. Chess isn't always exciting  sacrifices or wonderful combinations that leave your opponent baffled. Many  are just trench warfare that can be tedious if you're impatient. It's this  very type of game that makes the pawn such an important part of Chess. 325  pages of numerous opening complexes explaining what your pawn structure  should be makes this book well worth the read.	2000-08-26

This book is an  updated version of a 1970 release with 12 of the 55 games offered coming  after 1970. The games range from the years 1844 to 1995.

IM Michael Basman has won a number of Master  games with it, so regardless of Raymond Keene's opinion on this being a  horrible opening, The Grob is not without logic. If you're looking for  something different, this is definately it, as 1.g4 or as Black 1.e4 g5  (1.d4 h6, 2.e4 g5) can be a great 'shock value' opening for the  intermediate and club player. I have won with this opening many times, but  i will admit, i can't see it being a major part of my opening repertoire.  It would be nice if Basman wrote a follow-up to this book for more current  treaments, as well as the Gambit line of 1.g4 d5, 2.Bg7 Bxg4 which is not  addressed here. This book will not appeal to all, but i am the type of  player that loves to throw 'odd' lines at my opponent. There's also a small  section of 3 games touching on the 'Global Opening' which deals with 1.h3  and 1.a3 or 1.h6 and 1.a6 for Black. I would like to see Basman write a  book with more detailed analysis of this as well. In closing, i have to  give this book 5 stars, partially because it's not as bad (at least at the  intermediate level) as most people think, and it's extremely entertaining.  Many people i have faced comment on how much they hate facing the Grob  quite simply because they are unsure how to play against it. Most people  are not 'serious' chess players, so why not go for a little gusto now and  then?	2000-08-24

The book is rather dated (mine has the original published  date as 1947) and is done in descriptive notation, but i found it to be  entertaining and i can gather that Lasker genuinely adored the game. Lasker  expounds on the original ideas of William Steinitz, and displays his own  originality, versatility and his abilty to take solid calculated risks. His  tournament record from 1889-1936 was 192 wins, 34 losses and 99 draws (73.1  percent). You can't argue with those numbers facing top competition.  Beginners and novices should hold off on this book until they gain more  expereince.	2000-08-24

Considered a King's Gambit with  colours reversed, White can get in trouble real early if care is not taken.  This is not the most solid defence in the world, but it's fun to play and  fits my style of 'what they dont know WILL hurt them'. 13 Chapters on the  various lines played are given, so it's not lacking in study by any means.  I've always enjoyed Tony Kosten's books and this one is no exception. Buyer  Beware though: if you're not prepared to venture into uncharted waters then  you may find this book a waste of your time. For the rest of us, who  occasionally grow tired of facing the Spanish or Guioco Piano, or using the  Sicilian, French, Caro-Kann, Philidor, Petroff or the Modern defences, it's  well worth the effort.	2000-08-24

Even though Basman has been a  leading proponent of 'irregular openings' such as Grob's Attack and the St.  George, his aim here is quite simply to help the lesser player improve with  the ideas expounded upon by using more conventional openings. For White:  The Guioco Piano (1.e4 e5, 2.Nf3 Nc6, 3.Bc4) is one of the oldest openings  known. The Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5, 2.c4) is also a solid choice if the  player as White prefers a Queen pawn opening. For Black: The Sicilian  Dragon (1.e4 c5, 2.Nf3 d6, 3.d4 cxd4, 4.Nxd4 Nf6, 5.Nc3 g6, 6.Be2 Bg7) is  the most basic variation. This is a very popular opening defence for Black.  For White: The Morra Gambit, more recently called the Smith-Morra Gambit.  This is a response by White to the Sicilian defence (1.e4 c5, 2.d4 cxd4,  3.c3) which is a true Gambit, unlike the Queen's Gambit, but offers open  lines of play for White that can throw Black for a loop if they're not  expecting it. Lastly, for Black, The Nimzo-Indian defence (1.d4 Nf6, 2.c4  e6, 3.Nc3 Bb4) which can be quite dynamic. Of all the 'Indian' defences,  this one is my favorite unless I really want to shake things up with the  Benoni defence. Overall, if you're a beginner or novice player who has very  little knowledge of opening theory, I would suggest a copy of this book.  It's flexible and done rather nicely by Mr. Basman.	2000-08-24

Facing the King's Indian  defence with the same old tired ideas White is supposed to employ? Need  something unfamiliar to Pirc defence, Benoni defence and Dutch defence  players? Here's your answer!! An all purpose book for the Queen's pawn  player, ideas and games are given to show you that 2.c4 can be avoided  while still maintaining nice attacking chances. Even though 2.e4 is still  given when facing the Pirc, the move order shortly after will leave Pirc  players on their own since they can have quite a few 'normal' variations  memorized to some extent. I have had particular success with the Berry  Attack facing King's Indian defence players. It's great because instead of  White castling Kingside and often coming under fire with Black's Kingside  pawn advances, White holds off, perhaps castling Queenside instead, and  ramming the King's Rook pawn (H Pawn) down Black's throat, eventually  opening the Black Kingisde up, which is exactly the opposite of what Black  is expecting. I love this book and will continue to employ the ideas put  forth when the mood strikes me.	2000-08-24

There are  variants to Whites Move 4 such as Nh3 and c3. This book would seem to be  more suited to the tournament player where the competition will oblige said  lines. I can't even get the average player to use Move 2 of g3. Just from  reading it, i can tell it offers solid advice and principles, but i have  little use for it right now unfortunately. It was the only 'Dutch' book i  could find at the time, and i didn't pay full price for it, so i don't feel  completely ripped-off. My suggestion is to get this book if you employ the  Dutch and play in tournaments regularly or look elsewhere for a more  generalized viewpoint of the Dutch defence.	2000-08-24
US	51628669	R152LRNZB26N1O	1857442954	245564716	English Defence	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Refreshing	I just recently purchased this book and i really enjoy it. It's about time  this somewhat obscure defence received more attention. Move order is 1.c4  b6, 2.d4 e6 with Black's 3rd move usually Bb7. The only drawback is if  White opens 1.d4 King says it's very important to answer with e6. This of  course gives White the option of 2.e4 which leads to the French defence. So  you will have to brush up on the French a bit if you expect to employ this  opening since 1.d4 seems more popular than 1.c4<br />Contrary to King's axiom  that 1.d4 players would rather use 2.c4 than 2.e4, i have not found this to  be the case. The book is very well written though and perhaps adding the  French back into my repertoire was a good idea anyway. You won't be  disappointed.	2000-08-22
US	51628669	RR53F4CY0QHA8	0713457880	829656014	The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings, Algebraic Edition	Books	1	4	7	N	N	Completely Out of Date	For the general King and Queen Pawn players, this book may have something  to offer. However, the approach is far too dogmatic for today's styles. 10  basic rules are given and Rule #1 is: Open with either the e or d pawn.  Rule #5 states: Make one or two pawn moves in the opening, not more. Rule  #7: Castle as soon as possible, preferably on the king's side. The other  rules make more sense, but these 3 examples are quite barbaric unless you  are going to play mainline variations of the Ruy Lopez for example. The  last chapter (ONE WHOLE PAGE) addresses irregular openings, giving one  example of 1.g6 for Black as the irregular opening. I never realized the  Modern defence was 'irregular'. This 1989 release is a republish of the  1943 book Fine put out with the more updated algebraic notation. Please  don't waste your hard earned money on this.	2000-08-22

Move order for White usually consists of 1.e4 2.Nc3 3.Bc4 4.d3  5.f4 6.Nf3 and 7.O-O Unlike the King's Gambit though, the F pawn is  protected on it's release by the Queen's Bishop since the Queen's Pawn is  previously moved to d3. The King's Rook at some point should have a  half-open F file to manuever on, which does have it's advantages. The  downside to this opening is that it doesn't place pressure on Black's King  Pawn immediately, giving Black more room to breathe so to speak in the very  beginning. White has a choice of quiet strategic lines and violent gambits.  Fun to pull out to surprise your opponent.	2000-08-22

Eight Books in One	Books	2	2	7	N	N	Good for Beginners and Novices	Over 675 pages, this was the first book i bought a few years ago that got me 'really' interested in chess. The descriptive notation is a bit tedious since this book was published back in the 1950's. However, many openings  are addressed, most of which i had never heard of at the time. Some of the  past negative reviews here on Amazon about Reinfeld's book are true. I can  only assume Reinfeld was trying to cover as much general information as  possible, which doesn't lend well to strong intermediate advancement. As a  chess player though, i think it is important to know descriptive notation  as well as algebraic and you have to start somehwere. I would recommend a  used copy at a discount store if you don't feel like paying full price for  more up to date books in this category. I haven't looked at the book in  quite awhile, but the only real error i remember is Reinfeld's damnation of  Philidor's defence (1.e4 e5, 2.Nf3 d6). Perhaps during that era that  defence had a bad reputation, but it's definately a sound defence. The Ruy  Lopez (1.e4 e5, 2.Nf3 Nc6, 3.Bb5) often has Black playing an early d6  hemming in his King's Bishop, so what's so bad about doing the same thing  using Philidor's defence? Overall, a decent book, but out of date.	2000-08-20

Authored by Garry Kasparov and Raymond Keene. Certainly not the most up to date material on the wide variety of openings it covers, but it does explain each opening rather well. Over 400 pages with a good  Index at the back. I have referenced this book dozens of times and have found it  very helpful. Contains several variations for all the main openings.	2000-08-20

An uncompromising system. At the time  of publication Karpov had scored 6 wins, 1 loss and 16 draws vs Garry  Kasparov (1986-1990) using his anti-Grunfeld approach. Chapters 1 &amp; 2  (1.d4 Nf6, 2.c4 g6, 3.Nc3 d5, 4.cxd5, Nxd5, 5.e4 Bg7). Chapter 3 (5.e4 Nxc3  6.bxc3 Bg7). Chapter 4 (4.Nf3 Bg7). Chapter 5 (4.Bf4 Bg7) and Chapter 6  (3.Nf3 Bg7, 4.g3 c6, 5.Bg2 d5). Sorry for the technical jargon, but who  wants to buy an opening book without at least knowing the types of  positions that may arise after the first few moves? I have turned down  several books due to the lack of opening description. I hope this helps.	2000-08-20

It's not an easy  defence to master however. Invariably, the Knight on f6 is forced to  several different squares by pawn thrusts on White's part on many  occasions. This is a double edged sword. White either ends up getting his  advanced pawns picked off or develops a strong enough initiative that  suffocates Black. I've had varied success with it, but seem to do better in  Blitz games where my opponent has less time to come up with more solid  moves. I can definately see the potential though and i recommend this book  to anyone looking to avoid the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano, King's Gambit or if  you're tired of using or unfamiliar with the French, Caro-Kann, Sicilian,  Pirc or the Modern defences. It's certainly challenging and fun.	2000-08-20

In this variation, the Queen's Bishop is fianchetto'd instead of  the King's Bishop. 1.d4 Nf6, 2.c4 e6, 3.Nf3 b6 is the starting order. If  White chooses 3.Nc3 then you need to give the Nimzo-Indian defence a look  (3...Bb4). The only problem is that White has the choice of which Knight to  bring out on Move 3, so you really need to learn both the Queen's Indian  and the Nimzo-Indian defences if you aren't going to be using the King's  Indian, Grunfeld or Benoni defences or the Benko Gambit. Transpositions are  very common in these lines. This is definately one of the best books on the  subject of the Queen's Indian.	2000-08-20

There are a few Gambit lines that are covered in good detail because quite simply they are  considered sound or at least popular. The lesser known Gambits are not  handled with the same enthusiasm. Listing them in alphabetical order makes  it easy to locate as well. Even though Raymond Keene is a great chess  writer, he is not infallible. Under the 'Grob' (1.g4) he states this may be  the worst opening move if 1.f3 isn't. Of course this was published back in  1992, and recent trends show that a g4 pawn spike can be rather effective  even if castled Kingside. My question to Mr. Keene would be: what about  1.h4, 1.Nh3, 1.a4, and 1.Na3? A trivial matter however which just goes to  show you don't have to believe everything you read no matter who's writing  the book. Buy it if you can find it for less than $10 US.	2000-08-20
US	51628669	R1TJJVC2OZFWDK	1886040133	741778639	The Big Book of Busts (Competitive Chess Series)	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Misleading	An entertaining book, yet lacking any real refutations to irregular  openings for the average to club player. Irregular openings are played for  a reason, for shock value. Of course highly ranked players usually defeat  such openings, not because the opening itself is inferior (in most cases)  but because the player facing these openings is quite simply the better  player. I have seen highly ranked players use irregular openings with  success against players supposedly booked up on how to combat them. If IM  Michael Basman and Deep Blue can win with 'garbage' like the Grob against  other Masters, then obviously it's not as bad as it's reputation. This book  is merely a starting point for ideas on how to combat such openings. If a  particular opening is causing you difficulties, get your best software  program out and research the problem yourself. If anything, this book shows  players who use irregular openings the possible defences/attacks they can  expect, which will just confuse the issue even further. I give this book a  3 star rating, which i consider neutral, because it actually helps *both*  the player facing these openings and the player who uses them.	2000-08-20

The Adavance Variation for White is employed (1.e4 c6,  2.d4 d5, 3.e5). Great for Novices and Intermediates who don't face the  Caro-Kann too often. For a more advanced system for White, i would suggest  Angus Dunnington's 'The Ultimate King's Indian Attack' which covers a  system for White not only against the Caro-Kann defence, but also the  Sicilian defence and the French defence.	2000-08-20
