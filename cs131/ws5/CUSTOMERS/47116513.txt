This is the text book of choice for the class. So far I have enjoyed Mr. Phillip's observation of the Biblical texts. He writes from a non-critical standpoint. Which I think is very important. Great outlines are found in this 528 page book. In a phone conversation with Mr. Phillips he points out that he wrote most of his commentary by long hand, and that it gives him the time to think and meditate on the various books of the Bible he wrote comments on. WHAT A GOOD WORK he has done. We are truly the recipients of classic work done by observant men. Thank you so very much Mr. Phillips. He also recommends whole heartedly his works on Psalms and Proverbs -- I haven't had the chance to see or read them yet, but I sure will look forward to picking up my own copy.	2004-11-27

A Comparison of Covenant and Dispensational Theology	Books	5	11	19	N	N	Outstanding Book on Dispensationalism	For a while there I thought Charles Ryrie's book is about the only book I could recommend. Thankfully Mr.Showers has contributed a fine book. Did you know that Mr. Showers also has an outstanding book on Eschatology: MARANATHA and also a new one on the Pre-Wrath (exposing that view to be heretical), both books are great!	2002-03-05

To lump them together is pure ignorance illustrated. Mr. Cloud is a well informed, and well read man on the issue of Bible Translation. He is not perfection and he does not claim to be so anyway. He is a man of God and is doing something to impact the lives of many who hold to the very promise of Jesus that His words will never pass away.	2001-10-17

This book on prayer happens to be more indepth than another book he has written, which is &quot;How to Pray&quot; (also a good book). Just about any work from Torrey would be highly recommended.

Moody once said: &quot;Salvation is free, as free as the air we breath...&quot;. While it is true that the gospel is simple and that salvation is a free gift. Many proffesing Christians are mere proffesors, that is to say that their concept of salvation relies on the fact that they have &quot;prayed&quot; and &quot;ask Jesus into their hearts&quot;, well meaning? hopefully yes, but at best it is not relying on Christ alone. This is an example of faith in faith, i.e. existensialism. What people need is faith in Christ, and in Him alone, void of any efforts, empty of self; through repentance from sin and faith in Christ, any sinner can have salvation. This book provides a good deal of ideas for evangelizing the lost, without the heresy of instant prayerism.	2001-10-12
