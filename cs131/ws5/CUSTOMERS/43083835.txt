His Alex Delaware books, in particular, have not had the same quality they once did, and his contribution to the collaboration (with his wife Faye) Double Homicide was completely forgettable.  His last truly good book was Billy Straight, which featured detective Petra Connor.  With Twisted, he brings her back and once again, writes a good book. <br /> <br />In Twisted, Petra is called in to investigate a drive-by shooting that has left several teenagers dead.  It doesn't seem like a typical gang slaying and most of the leads go nowhere.  This story, however, is merely a subplot.  The main story deals with an intern who she is working with;  this young genius has found that a series of murders have all taken place on the same day, June 28, with enough similarities to not be mere coincidence. <br /> <br />With another June 28 soon approaching, Petra needs to unofficially investigate this serial killing even as she looks into her main case.  Both stories are interesting, but not exactly whodunits; it would be impossible for the reader to figure things out any faster than Petra does. <br /> <br />Why do the Petra Connor stories succeed while the recent Alex Delaware books are hit or miss?  Principally, it's because Petra is a more interesting character and she is surrounded by some decent supporting characters.  Besides Milo Sturgis, there are no real recurring characters of substance in the Delaware books (for many volumes, his girlfriend Robin had little more than a brief cameo for an obligatory sex scene).  Perhaps writing in the third person helps Kellerman with his characterization (and in fact, the best recent Delaware book - The Murder Book - is around 50% third person). <br /> <br />Whatever the case, Twisted is a reminder that Kellerman still can write a good novel.  Current Kellerman fans should be pleased with this effort, and those new to this writer will not be disappointed.   <br />	2005-10-12

Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Entertaining, but lots of filler	Why Do Men Have Nipples is a generally clever little book that answers all sorts of silly questions that kind of float in the back of our minds but we rarely dare to ask.  There are details about all sorts of bodily functions and excretions as well as debunking of various myths about foods and drinks.  How dangerous are pop rocks?  Not very.  Does chocolate cause acne?  No. <br /> <br />While filled with all sorts of good information, the book does suffer from unnecessary filler, in particular the transcript of certain online chats the two authors had.  This filler material is rambling, only occasionally amusing and - as stated before - unnecessary.  In addition, for some of the questions addressed, we are given half-answers or non-answers that leave us remaining in the dark on the issue. <br /> <br />Despite the good, often witty, presentation of some of the information, these flaws are sufficient to reduce the book to a low four stars.  While I would recommend it based on its assets, I would also issue a warning that this book could be better. <br />	2005-10-12
US	43083835	R181BDLJE7OT53	0553802046	891786366	The Society (Palmer, Michael)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good thriller	Michael Palmer, a master of the medical thriller, focuses on the managed care industry in his latest paperback, The Society.  The story is about a serial killer who is preying on HMO executives; Will Grant, a surgeon and spokesman for the Hippocrates Society - an organization dedicated to managed care reform - becomes a sympathetic figure to the mysterious killer.  This both makes him a target and a suspect, a situation exacerbated when he is drugged and made to look like an addict. <br /> <br />Among those investigating the crime is Patty Moriarty, who must contend with sexist superiors who ignore her obviously good insights.  Just as obvious is that she will be a love interest for Will.  In fact, although Palmer has his share of plot twists, some things are rather evident:  for example, I had the killer pegged within the first forty pages (although there was more going on than a simple killing spree). <br /> <br />Actually, if the novel has a real flaw, it is the one-sided nature of the debate over managed care.  Yes, Michael Palmer is a doctor and he has some good anecdotes to support his case, but it ain't that simple.  I have enough experience with health care to know that the problem is far more complex than presented here and that more than just managed care organizations are at fault; the responsibility can be shared by a number of different interests.  Much of the first hundred pages of this book are a standard \\"blame-the-HMOs\\" political tract that oversimplifies the problems of health care and is probably overdone in a suspense novel. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Palmer is able to rise above his problems to produce a good book, one with likeable protagonists that make you want to keep turning the pages.  I wouldn't recommend this novel for its insights into health care issues, but as a thriller, it is a worthwhile, four-star read. <br />	2005-09-29

In the world of Marvel superheroes, there are your A-Listers like Spiderman and your B-Listers like the Vision.  Somewhere around the D-List, between Howard the Duck and Millie the Model, you will find Killraven. Reading the Essential Killraven (a bit of an oxymoron), you see there is a good reason he is obscure.  Killraven is not a hidden treasure recently unearthed, but more like finding a small bag of coins:  there is some value, but not as much as you'd hope for.<br /><br />The premise of this story is a sequel to The War of the Worlds.  One hundred years after the original invasion, the Martians are back, prepared for the germs that defeated them earlier.  This time, they make short work of humanity, killing most people and saving the rest for either food or scientific experiments.  Jonathan Raven, a child at the time of the invasion (his age seems to fluctuate as the story develops) is put into bondage and raised to be a gladiator called Killraven.  Eventually he escapes and with some other \\"freemen\\" wages a guerilla war against the Martians.<br /><br />The early issues of the series are instantly forgettable, a reminder that Marvel put out its share of mediocre works in the early `70s.  The writing is generally bad and the art is not much better.  Eventually, things do pick up, particularly with the writing and the last issues (plus the graphic novel and Marvel Knights story) are decent.<br /><br />There are other problems, most glaringly that this is supposedly a story that takes in the near-future of the \\"Marvel Universe, \\" but it is impossible to believe that the Martians could so easily take over a world with the likes of Thor, the Silver Surfer and a dozen other high-powered heroes (not to mention big name villains like Magneto or Dr. Doom who might resent such an invasion); if the Martians were that tough (and they aren't), the low-powered Killraven would be impossibly out-classed.  There are also continuity problems, most noticeably with Killraven's brother who changes from being younger to being older.<br /><br />But the biggest problem with Killraven is the lack of interesting characters.  Killraven is never very compelling and his allies are often less so.  This could be offset by good villains, but with rare exception, the bad guys are as dull as the good guys.<br /><br />If Killraven was a real-life person, he'd be one of those semi-celebrities that you'd wonder whatever happened to, if you even remembered him.  He'd try to make a comeback on some Surreal Life-like show and then fade away again.  Fortunately, Killraven is a fictional character, subject to the decisions of Marvel editors who realize that he belongs in relative obscurity; I doubt we will see any real comeback for this character, beyond the minimal amount necessary to maintain legal rights.  Based on what I've read in this volume, this obscurity is well-deserved.	2005-09-23

Probably not	Imagine you're a published but reasonably obscure writer and you're given the assignment of a lifetime: the sequel of one of the all-time best-selling novels (and the inspiration for three movies).  You know that this sequel will be an automatic bestseller.  Will you be able to deliver a worthwhile book?  In the case of Mark Winegardner and his follow-up to the Godfather, the answer is...sort of.    The Godfather Returns details the history of the Corleone family shortly after the time the original novel (and original movie) ended.  It covers the period from the mid-fifties to early sixties, overlapping briefly with the late-fifties story told in the movie The Godfather Part II.  Michael Corleone is the central character in this saga.  He is a man who has sacrificed his sense of decency to achieve a level of great power within the criminal underworld; torn between his desire to reform and his greed for more power, he often gives into the latter, using his family as a crutch to justify his crimes.    His two principal opponents in this book are his brother Fredo and a subordinate crime boss named Nick Geraci.  Fredo, weak-willed and not all that bright, is not a great threat in himself except as a source of embarrassment.  Geraci, on the other hand, is smart and quite dangerous, in some ways a mirror image of Michael:  both have monogamous lives, are temperate with alcohol, are physically tough (Michael an ex-Marine, Nick an ex-boxer) and mentally astute.  Much of the plot deals with the machinations between the two.    There is very little that is wrong with this book, but there is also very little that is outstanding.  The big problem is that Winegardner is almost trying too hard.  The result is a story that is more complicated than it needs to be, with more characters and plot than necessary; this actually bogs down the book and makes it a slower read.  It's as if Winegarder didn't want to leave anything out.    Put in ice-skating terms, Winegardner scores high ontechnical merit but just so-so for artistic worth.  Because the source material is so interesting, the book more-or-less succeeds, but if this had been completely original, it would be of lesser value.  Overall, this is slightly above average, but still only rates three stars (but somehow I accidentally rated it one star and now can't change it).	2005-09-23

In this particular novel, the criminals have a distinctly retro feel to them:  they are old-style Russian communists, hardly a regular source of villainy in 21st Century America. <br /> <br />The mastermind of the crimes is a Soviet sleeper agent who's been living quietly in the U.S. for decades.  Now in his nineties, he is still pretty sharp and has recruited his great-grandson to carry on the cause.  This seventeen year old kid becomes a political assassin and commits almost the perfect murder.  Unfortunately, a homeless woman has witnessed the crime and thus begins an escalating series of murders and other crimes. <br /> <br />Sadly, this is one of the weaker books in the Prey series, not really bad but with little of the things that make the other books so good.  Generally speaking, the best books in the series are when Davenport is at his edgiest, but here he seems almost bored, more interested in the crime as an intellectual exercise than as something that emotionally involves him.  For Sandford fans, there is enough here to enjoy, but a first-time reader might be disappointed (it's best to start this series at the beginning, with Rules of Prey).  Happily, Sandford typically comes back from these more minor efforts, so even if this rates three stars, there is most likely better books in the future. <br />	2005-09-21

The Declaration of Independence was signed, resulting in the birth of the United States.  This incident, historically the most significant event of the year, is hardly even referred to in David McCullough's book, 1776.  Instead, his history focuses on the battles of the Revolutionary War that took place in that pivotal year. <br /> <br />The Revolution started in 1775, but it was in 1776 that the battling started to become more significant, the result of a heightened British resolve to contain the rebellion in its colonies.  Outnumbered by generally better trained British soldiers and Hessian mercenaries, much of the year was a series of unpleasant defeats tempered by minor victories.  As the year came to a close, the Revolution was on the brink of failure, but then Washington led his troops into a pair of big wins, first at Trenton, then Princeton. <br /> <br />In terms of sheer numbers, these may have seemed like small victories, but they re-energized the Revolutionary forces and became a turning point in the war.  Unlike the D-Day invasion nearly two centuries later, this turning point wouldn't lead to victory in less than a year; in fact, the key win at Yorktown wouldn't occur for another five years and peace would be two years beyond even that. <br /> <br />Writing about a particular year is not an easy way to approach history.  When writing a biography (such as Truman or John Adams), there is a distinct beginning and end with birth and death.  Similarly, when McCullough wrote of the building of the Panama Canal or Brooklyn Bridge, he had natural starting points.  A year, however, is rather arbitrary, as human events rarely fit so neatly into a calendar.  I think this makes McCullough's book suffer a little as he needs to force his story to fit his topic (and indeed, the book actually deals a lot with 1775 as well).  To me, this makes this one of his weaker efforts, but being merely good after a string of great books is nothing to scoff at.  Aimed at the general reader, this is a worthwhile look at the early struggles of the Revolution and how close it came to ending quite differently. <br />	2005-09-21
US	43083835	RC7TNVMW2FODK	075640181X	805995001	The War of the Flowers	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Imaginative stand-alone fantasy	It has always been one of my big gripes with the fantasy genre that it's almost impossible to find a good single volume fantasy story; everything is a trilogy, and I mean that in a loose sense of the word to represent any multi-volume story.  Is it impossible to write a single volume story?  Of course not, but many fantasy writers are willing to stretch out there sagas for considerations that are more commercial than creative.  Thus it is with a certain irony that one of the big selling points with Tad Williams's War of the Flowers is that is a standalone fantasy novel.  In a world of bloated trilogies, a story that is contained within a single book is rare enough that it is instantly attractive.   <br /> <br />The last time I read a standalone fantasy, it was David Eddings's horrid Redemption of Althalus.  The War of the Flowers, while no masterpiece, is quite a bit better than that other book.  Essentially, The War of the Flowers is a decently written routine fantasy, a reworking of one of the most common plots:  a man from the \\"real\\" world is transported to a magical realm where a great destiny awaits him. <br /> <br />In this case, the man is Theo Vilmos, a rock singer/flower delivery guy whose life has gone nowhere in his thirty years of life.  While going through his mother's belongings after her death, he is led to a book written by his great-uncle, a supposedly fictional chronicle about a land occupied by various fairies, goblins and other beings.  Of course, it isn't fiction and Theo is soon in this magic realm where he learns various powers-that-be intend to use him as a pawn in their schemes. <br /> <br />While Williams has put together a story that is reasonably imaginative, it is also the same sort of fantasy any fan of the genre has probably encountered many times before.  The principal strength to the novel is that Williams is aware that his tale isn't particularly original and atones for it through some clever humor poking fun at the various clichshe is using.  Even the title is an obvious spoof of the historical War of the Roses, as becomes clear quickly since the novel deals with various noble families contending for world rulership.  On the other hand, the big weakness in the book is Theo, a character who is typically pathetic and rarely heroic; what's worse, he typically just reacts to situations and rarely acts on his own until very late in the book; as a result, he is not a very compelling character. <br /> <br />Based on the fact that Williams's other works are also multi-volume, The War of the Flowers is more of an aberration than the beginning of a trend, but the mere fact that this a standalone fantasy novel elevates the book from a high three star effort to a solid four stars.  As stated before, this is not an original story, but it is good enough to be worth reading for fantasy fans. <br />	2005-09-04
US	43083835	R2CHD14HB168Z7	0312868855	396467465	Hell House	Books	5	11	11	N	Y	One of the great haunted house stories	Richard Matheson is the horror writer that everyone seems to know without ever knowing his name.  The Incredible Shrinking Man, Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come are all his, along with I Am Legend (made into the movies The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man) and such wonderful short stories as Nightmare at 20,000 Feet (a classic Twilight Zone episode) and Duel (adapted into an early Spielberg made-for-TV movie).  I could go on, but I think my point is clear:  his name may not be as big as King or Koontz, but Richard Matheson is one of the biggest horror writers out there. <br /> <br />Hell House (also adapted into a movie, The Legend of Hell House) is yet another reason why Matheson is the tops in his field.  A dying rich man wants to know if there is life after death.  He recruits three people to provide the answer:  Lionel Barrett, a parapsychologist who believes in \\"supernormal\\" phenomena but dismisses ghosts as mere delusion.  Florence Tanner, an ex-actress and spiritualist medium.  Ben Fischer, the only survivor from the last foray into Hell House thirty years earlier. <br /> <br />These three, along with Barrett's wife Edith, are indeed going to Hell House, the nickname for the Belasco house that is considered the Mount Everest of haunted houses.   These researchers must go into Hell House for a week to see if they can find proof of ghosts.  Besides the normal packed clothes and the like, all four carry other baggage; for example Barrett is partially crippled and impotent and his wife is sexually repressed.  The house will soon enough start preying on all these weaknesses. <br /> <br />But what haunts Hell House?  Is it the ghost of the viciously evil Belasco, as Florence believes?  Or is it merely the psychic residue of the many atrocities that took place within its walls, as Barrett believes?  Can the answer be determined before they become the house's latest victims? <br /> <br />Matheson is as good as ever in telling this tale.  As with many of hisstories, he is adept at making the reader doubt whether some of the events that occur are truly happening or merely imagined by the characters.  Admittedly, with the shifting viewpoints of the four, it seems likely that something \\"supernormal\\" is going on. <br /> <br />Among haunted house stories, this is one of the best in the bunch.  I suggest it is read along with Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, which bears some similarities to Hell House and was probably an influence on Matheson.  However, even if you never read Jackson's book, don't skip this one; it is a classic story from a classic writer. <br />	2005-09-04

What too often happens is a reverse synergy:  the result is less than the sum of the parts.  In Double Homicide, this rule holds up, as successful writers (and husband and wife) Jonathan and Faye Kellerman combine to write a pair of tepidly written novellas. <br /> <br />The first novella - In the Land of Giants - follows a pair of detectives in Boston who investigate the murder of a college basketball player.  The second story - Still Life - has a pair of Santa Fe detectives looking into the murder of a art gallery owner.  Neither story is anything beyond just routine:  the characters are dull and there are no real plot twists and some story elements never really go anywhere. <br /> <br />If I had to guess, I'd say the first story was written more by Faye Kellerman and the second by Jonathan, and even if In the Land of Giants is slightly better than what follows, it is not good.  Neither story is truly awful, but they only merit two stars, either individually or as a set.  If this is an indication of what the Kellerman's can do when working together, it's just as well that they seem to be going back to solo writing.  For fans of either writer, this is bound to be a disappointment and should be skipped. <br />	2005-09-04

This has less to do with what happens in the book as what doesn't happen:  we don't get a real resolution. <br /> <br />As Book Six opens, Harry is mourning the loss of his godfather Sirius Black, Voldemort is beginning to strike more boldly at his adversaries and Severus Snape is making a promise to protect Draco Malfoy as Harry's adversary is recruited to do some malicious task for Voldemort's Death Eaters.  Dumbledore, a significant yet secondary character, finally emerges fully from the background as he begins to assist in Harry's education. <br /> <br />While a lot happens in this novel, it is not a \\"complete\\" book with a real conclusion.  Instead, this book seems to serve as an extended prologue to the seventh book; everything within seems to build toward that concluding volume, one which I would guess would be the longest in the set.  While nearly as good as the other books, there are times when Rowling is definitely off her game; in particular, the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince is rather anticlimactic when solved.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, for those irritated with Harry's behavior in the previous book (wherein he often acts like a sullen teenager), we get an improved Harry in this volume, by no means perfect but generally more confident and mature.  However, while the other five books would rate five stars, I can only give this one four.  Consider this grade an \\"Incomplete\\"; when we see the final result next book, maybe this one will seem better as it fits into the entire saga. <br />	2005-09-04
US	43083835	R1REII77ST3QP0	0143034758	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	Top-notch biography	A couple hundred years back, the early American government was divided into two camps, the Republicans and the Federalists.  The Federalists have long since passed as a party and the Republicans have substantially changed in their transformation to the modern Democratic party.  You'd think that this 18th century party warfare would be ancient history, but even now, among historians, the battle continues.  Some are Republicans and still honoring the likes of Jefferson and Madison while vilifying their opponents.  And some historians are Federalists.  Richard Brookheiser, author of books on Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris and the Adams family is certainly one.  Ron Chernow is another. <br /> <br />Knowing this going into Chernow's excellent biography of Alexander Hamilton prepares the reader for the obvious slant of his book.  In general, biographers look favorably upon their subjects and this is no exception.  Hamilton is the hero of this story, and the other Federalists are generally looked upon positively.  On the other hand, the Republicans - Jefferson, Monroe, Madison and especially Aaron Burr - are generally villains in this book. <br /> <br />This is no hagiography.  Hamilton's negative traits are clearly presented:  his adultery, his support of the Alien and Sedition Acts, his rants against John Adams.  More important to Chernow, however, is Hamilton's essential contributions to creating the early U.S. government.  The development of the Constitution and its subsequent ratification are due in large part to Hamilton's efforts, particularly through the Federalist Papers which he wrote a good portion of.  As Secretary of the Treasury, he played a significant role in getting the country on a decent financial footing.  In fact, among the so-called Founding Fathers, he is one of the most important, ranking behind Washington but on a par with Jefferson, Madison and Adams.  While these were all intelligent people, Hamilton (along with Jefferson) probably were the smartest.   <br /> <br />So the Republicans hated the Federalists and vice versa (and everyone hated Burr, who unctuously moved between the two).  And in the more gentle arenas of history and biography, the battle continues and is unlikely to be resolved soon.  Chernow's book - adeptly written and very entertaining - reminds us that the ideas that this nation were founded on still are worth thinking and arguing about. <br />	2005-09-04

However, the features you might look for in a good book you will not find in Brimstone.    Glancing at some of the other reviews for this novel, I realize I am putting forth a contrary opinion when I say that this novel is generally weak, a poorly-written two-star quality novel that is mildly entertaining but has such significant problems it can not even be called \\"average.\\"    The plot focuses on the hideous murder of an art critic.  Beside his charred remains is a hoofprint and there are suspicions that something supernatural caused the death.  Investigating the crime is FBI agent Pendergast, a Sherlock Holmes-like investigator and Sergeant D'Agosta of the Southampton Police Department, who acts in the role of Watson.  When a second murder follows, the two characters start stirring up trouble, must deal with assassins and eventually wind up in Italy to pursue a lead.    Story-wise, there are a number of problems, perhaps none more significant than a subplot regarding a charismatic preacher.  While interesting, this storyline contributes absolutely nothing to the main story and seems to be nothing more than filler.  Similarly, a couple references to Pendergast's evil brother are essentially meaningless, except perhaps to offer hints about what the next book may be about.    Pendergast himself is a troublesome character.  With his near-omniscience, he isn't a very \\"human\\" character.  Also, just as Batman is always bailed out by his utility belt, Pendergast always seems to have exactly what he needs exactly when he needs it.  He's just too perfect a person to be a compelling character.    Even if these flaws (and others) were cleaned up, however, this would still not be more than an average book.  There is something about Child and Preston's writing that is just \\"off.\\"  I can't really describe it better than that; it seems technically fine, but it lacks the potency that good writing has.  I went into this book wanting to enjoy it and came out disappointed; I can tell others did not have this problem, but in my opinion, this is a book to avoid.	2005-08-30

It's good, but you always feel there was a more satisfying way to get to first base.  As a fan of baseball and an avid reader of history, this book seemed like a natural fit for me, but while decent, there was also something missing. <br /> <br />Covering the history of baseball up to 1876 (when the National League came into being), The History of Early Baseball follows the development of the sport from an amateur recreation to a professional competition.  In the beginning (in the 1850s), the early versions of baseball were played by clubs who would occasionally compete with each other.  There wasn't much rhyme or reason to which teams played each other or even the exact rules.  The people who played were from all walks of life, and it was strictly a part-time activity. <br /> <br />Eventually, however, the game got refined.  Players started playing specific positions and the best players started representing the clubs.  Eventually, to guarantee that such players wouldn't defect, money got into the equation.  The transition from amateur recreation to professional sport was gradual but inevitable. <br /> <br />The principal flaw with the book is that Goldstein writes as a historian, and this subject may be better covered by a sports writer.  Goldstein is interested in the changing economics of the game and the struggle between the management and the players.  This is a fine subject, but the result is that we lose some sense of the sport itself.  We don't read much about particular players or teams or games; in addition, the different rules of the 19th century game are not discussed in depth (with the exception of the \\"fly-ball rule\\").  Every baseball era has its stars, from Cap Anson to Ty Cobb to Babe Ruth to Ted Williams to Hank Aaron; certainly the early baseball era should have a couple, too, but Goldstein really doesn't discuss these people. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed this book, and many baseball fans will too.  The problem I mentioned does not keep the book from being an interesting read, but it does prevent it from getting a five star rating.  Nonetheless, this is a recommended read for fans of the game. <br />	2005-08-29

This leads to a \\"Fatal Attraction\\"-like obsession which is a little less violent but maybe even more disturbing. <br /> <br />What separates this from just being another Fatal Attraction rip-off is Joe, who has problems of his own.  Utterly rational - to the point of irrationality - Joe's attempts to clinically deal with his problems actually exacerbate them.  His absolute certainty in the correctness of his actions lead to paranoia and alienation; instead of getting assistance with Jed, he winds up looking crazy himself...and due to the first-person narrative, the reader may start assuming Joe is insane as well. <br /> <br />Although Ian McEwan may not be known as a suspense writer, Enduring Love shows that he is good at writing such tales.  But this is not merely a thriller; it's also a tale of obsession and guilt and how the two can intertwine.  This is a book well worth reading. <br />	2005-08-29
US	43083835	R3G19H7DMZ0OK0	0345453743	458212829	The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Classic	It had last been a couple decades ago when I had last read the various Hitchhiker's books (except the most recent one, and even that had been ten or more years back).  With my original copies scattered here and there, I picked up the omnibus edition and reread these tales with eagerness and a older (and perhaps wiser) perspective.  Overall, although they read differently after such a long time, they do make a pleasant read. <br /> <br />The original novel by Douglas Adams - based on a radio show he also wrote (the twisted history of the first book is related in an introduction) - is the sharpest in the set.  For the uninitiated, the tale follows Arthur Dent, last human survivor of Earth after the planet is cleared away for a hyperspatial bypass.  Along with his alien friend Ford Prefect, they go off on a series of adventures which will eventually reveal the true purpose of the planet Earth.  Completing a quintet of heroes is Zaphod Beeblebrox, the President of the Galaxy, and Trillian (Trisha MacMillan), another human who left Earth a while before it was destroyed, and Marvin, the most depressed robot ever.   <br /> <br />In this book, Adams sets the tone for this the whole series with a parody of the conventions of science fiction and a grand sense of the absurd.  In a universe where time travel and the improbable happen as a matter of course, contradictions, paradoxes and continuity problems are plentiful and acceptable.  The second novel - The Restaurant at the End of the Universe - directly follows up on the first book and is of equally high quality.   <br /> <br />An almost imperceptible slide begins with book three, Life, the Universe and Everything, which deals with an ancient race of aliens who are threatening to make a comeback and destroy all other life.  Arthur and Ford are recruited by planetary engineer Slartibartfast to try and save all reality.  We begin to see other of the characters pushed aside although they still do play some roles.  We also learnit is possible for a man to fly. <br /> <br />In So Long and Thanks For All the Fish, Arthur returns to an Earth that apparently believes its destruction was just a mass hallucination.  Although Ford is still around in a parallel story, the other recurring characters are almost non-existent.  This is the most upbeat of all the stories, with things finally going somewhat right for the usually hapless Arthur.  Unfortunately, some of the true wackiness is beginning to fade away.  With no Zaphod acting recklessly and with Ford acting semi-responsibly, this novel is not quite as much fun.  And sadly, Mostly Harmless, the final novel is even less fun, again absurd but not really very funny.  And the bonus short story \\"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\\" is completely forgettable. <br /> <br />The first three books remain five star material, the fourth gets four stars and the fifth gets three (the short story gets two).  As a collection, however, this is a five star bunch, with the first two books being excellent enough to offset any weaknesses in the others.  For any fan of science fiction, this is a must-read and continues to be the best parody of the genre. <br />	2005-07-10
US	43083835	RV35IXIRVVZUJ	0515133310	32851163	Echo Burning (Jack Reacher, No. 5)	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	Another great novel in a great series	In Lee Child's fifth Jack Reacher novel, we see that even a tired old plot, when given a new spin, can be made into an excellent story.   <br /> <br />In Echo Burning, an attractive woman picks up a hitchhiking loner and proceeds to tell him a story of marital woes; her husband abuses her and she can't escape from the marriage.  Through her sad story and through seduction, she tries to get the loner to kill her husband.  So far, this is a standard James Cain-like plot, but in this book, we get some twists that break from the usual pattern. <br /> <br />For one thing, the loner is Jack Reacher, by this time familiar to readers of the series as an ex-military policeman who now is voluntarily wandering the country, not looking for trouble but always seeming to find it.  Reacher is tough and smart, and unlike most characters in this plot situation, he refuses to be seduced and will not participate in a murder.  On the other hand, he does instinctually believe that abuse has occurred - and will continue again once the husband is freed from prison in a couple of days - so he does offer the woman a measure of protection. <br /> <br />But even then, there's more to this plot.  A parallel story follows a trio of very professional killers who are also in the area and have an agenda that is unclear but is doubtlessly something that will not be good for Reacher.  What's going on is more than a simple triangle of husband, wife and stranger, and these complications add an extra depth to the book. <br /> <br />Child is an excellent suspense writer.  Of the six Reacher books I've read so far (I haven't read them completely in order), none would get less than a five-star rating.  Child has the rare ability to combine perfectly two of the basic elements of the thriller:  plenty of action and reasonably sophisticated plotting.  As a result, Child winds up being a great storyteller and creates a book that is hard to put down from beginning to end. <br /> <br />With a minimal amount ofcontinuity between novels, the Reacher series can be read in almost any order, although chronologically is always recommended.  If you want to start with this one, however, you won't have any problems.  As stated before, this is a five-star effort and a must-read for thriller fans. <br />	2005-07-10

The few clues he has about who gave it to him lead nowhere, and the following month he gets another check in the mail.  This continues for years, as Josh gets married, has a kid and establishes a career; by this point, he has ceased to question why he is getting the funds and just considers them a bit of fluky luck. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the luck in question turns out to be bad.  By accepting the money, he has unknowingly become a sleeper agent for some East European spy agency and now they have come to collect.  Josh finds himself quickly trapped into acting for them, unable to go to the authorities and fearful for his life and his family's. <br /> <br />Donald Westlake is once again in top form in this tale of a man caught in circumstances beyond his control.  While in other novels, Westlake treats this situation with humor, but here the comic elements are limited (although there is Westlake's hilarious take on modern fantasy writers and their fans); instead, Westlake shows how his talents have not faded over four decades of stories. Although superficially a ludicrous plot, Westlake makes his tale utterly plausible and hence, more effective. <br /> <br />There are a lot of good suspense and mystery writers out there (and many not-so-good); Westlake is one of the best and this novel is a good indication as to why he is considered a master of the genre.   <br />	2005-07-10

Boyle's novel is in many ways a 1990s follow-up to Steinbeck's classic novel.  Even structurally, there are similarities between the two books as each alternates points of view in each chapter.  But even if this is a follow-up, it is not a rewrite, as this story covers new ground. <br /> <br />A bit of recent California history:  in 1994, the state passed Proposition 187, a law designed to deny public services (in particular health care and education) to illegal immigrants.  The proponents of this law stated it was a necessary step to keep state resources from getting overly depleted.  The opponents decried the law as racist and unconstitutional.  Just as there were two sides in the Prop 187 debate, there are two similar sides in The Tortilla Curtain, written shortly after this law was passed. <br /> <br />On one side are Delaney and Kyra Mossbacher, an upper-middle class couple living on the outskirts of the San Fernando Valley.  In general, they are politically liberal, but events transpire that make both of them turn to the right on the illegal immigration issue.  On the other side are Candido and America Rincon, two such immigrants who are struggling to exist, desperately trying to find work and not even eking out enough of an existence to have shelter or eat regularly.  The ways the lives of these four people intersect over the course of several months forms the basis of the novel. <br /> <br />If there is a central character, it is Delaney who we watch slowly changing from tolerance to indifference to hate for the many Mexicans, Salvadorans and other immigrants that seem to be everywhere in his life.  Where does Boyle himself seem to come down on this issue?  It's hard to say:  he obviously has sympathy for both sides, but also is willing to indict both sides.  This makes The Tortilla Curtain a book that will both irritate people at either extreme and pleasethose more towards the middle. <br /> <br />Personally, I enjoyed this book although it is admittedly not perfect.  In particular, the immigration issue so permeates this story that it is hard to believe the characters think of much else.  For the Rincons, barely surviving from day to day, this may be understandable, but for the Mossbachers, it comes off as more implausible that their entire existence would be centered around this issue.  On a side note, as one who lives near where the events of the story take place, I did enjoy Boyle's references to real streets and locations (although the gated community of Arroyo Blanco is fictitious). <br /> <br />Overall, this is another good-to-great work by Boyle, slightly flawed but generally well-written, enough to merit it a strong four stars.  As stated before, this book will not please everyone, but if you're politically open-minded, you should enjoy this novel. <br /> <br />	2005-06-13
US	43083835	R32IPSJVD4L8LC	1852854448	562522750	John Jay: Founding Father	Books	5	20	25	N	Y	An undeservedly obscure Founding Father	When you hear or read about the Founding Fathers, the same names pop up time and again:  Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton and Madison.  In sports terms, this was the starting lineup for the Revolutionary Era.  You can't win, however, without a good bench, and among the 18th century second-stringers, John Jay was an important player.    What did Jay do?  For starters, he was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and although he was not spectacular in the role, he did set a few precedents.  In addition, after leaving the post to become Governor of New York, he was re-offered the position by John Adams; when Jay declined resuming the post, Adams turned to John Marshall, who wound up being the most important Chief Justice of them all.    Jay also served as a President of the Continental Congress, so in a very limited way, he was the chief executive of the early United States.  He also participated in the treaty with Britain that ended the Revolution, served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in the pre-Constitutional era, and was one of the authors of the Federalist papers.  Although not a delegate in the Constitutional Convention, he actively campaigned for ratification and did contribute a couple of big ideas to the document:  the Supremacy Clause (acknowledging treaties and the Constitution as the supreme law of the land) and the provision limited the Presidency to natural-born citizens (a topical item considering the drive by some who see Arnold Schwarzenegger as a possible President).    Walter Stahr's competent if unspectacular biography of Jay is quite readable and shines a light on this somewhat obscure political figure.  Stahr's main failing (and it is generally a minor one) is that his affection for his subject sometimes affects his objectivity, leading him to explain Jay's actions.  This is no hagiography, however, and Stahr does occasionally put Jay under a harsher light.    For most people, John Jay is like Gouverneur Morris, John Hancock or Patrick Henry:  a man who is more or less in the background of the stories of other figures without ever really being defined beyond a few scant details.  Stahr, however, shows that this particular second-stringer was a most important utility player.  Although the book is not perfect, it gets a full five stars for overall quality and the fact that it provides illumination on a generally neglected historical figure.	2005-06-13
US	43083835	RCXSI91EZEKQS	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Routine thriller	As I got around fifty pages into Angels and Demons, I was reminded of something that occurred to me when I read The Da Vinci Code (its sequel) a couple years ago:  Dan Brown is not really a great writer.  That he is generally successful has more to do with the fact that he presents interesting ideas in a competent but unspectacular manner.  With The Da Vinci Code, the ideas alone were enough to merit a four star rating, but here the concepts are weaker and the novel is only of three star quality as a result. <br /> <br />The book introduces Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor who is an expert in religious symbols.  He is flown to the Swiss scientific facility CERN to provide information on a symbol branded into a murder victim.  This symbol leads Langdon to believe the Illuminati, a secret anti-Catholic organization is back in existence after a century.  Soon it becomes obvious that the murderer has stolen a chunk of antimatter and hidden it somewhere in Vatican City.  When the antimatter canister loses power (at exactly midnight), it will come in contact with normal matter and explode with the power of a small nuclear device.   <br /> <br />Langdon is paired with the murder victim's daughter.  (Could she be a love interest?  Considering the fact that she is essentially the only female in this story and her physical attributes are repeatedly described, this is a no-brainer.)  The two go to the Vatican, where there is also a papal election going on.  To find the antimatter requires the deciphering of a number of ancient riddles that date back to Galileo.  Fortunately, Langdon has the expertise to put them on the right track. <br /> <br />As with its sequel, the suspense fiction aspects of this story are utterly routine, and any veteran reader of this genre may be unimpressed with this novel.  We have the love interest, the sadistic perfect killer and the convoluted conspiracy that are all common to these books.  The characters, in particular Langdon are almost cookiecutter figures with no real depth.  On the other hand, while there is little new here, Brown is able to follow the formula well enough and offer enough interesting ideas to keep the book of at least average quality.  If you are interested in this book only as a diverting thriller, you may be better looking elsewhere like Robert Ludlum, Jon Land or Ken Follett...while Brown isn't bad, there are a lot better writers out there. <br />	2005-06-13

Since then, I have read Margolin's other books, some of which have been good and some of which have been merely passable.  None have approached the brilliance of that first book, and Sleeping Beauty is no exception. <br /> <br />In the beginning of the book, we are introduced to Miles Van Meter, a successful true crime author whose book (also called Sleeping Beauty) is the tale of a serial killer that affected his relatives and acquaintances.  At a book signing, he discusses the book briefly and then we go back to the time of the actual crimes and the story's protagonist, Ashley Spencer. <br /> <br />As a teenager, Ashley successfully escaped from a serial killer who killed her father and best friend.  A series of events points to the killer being Joshua Maxwell, a writer and instructor at the academy run by the Van Meter family.  His arrest and conviction will eventually follow, as we know from the very start of the story (during the book signing).  This is suspense fiction, however, so we aren't positive who else will be victimized, and, of course, what seems obvious most likely isn't the truth. <br /> <br />By the end of the novel, we will get that truth, which is generally plausible but dependent enough on coincidences to not be fully satisfying.  This, however, does not fully detract from the fact that this is a generally good book.  While it clearly does not stand out from a dozen other similar books, Margolin is accomplished enough to at least make it entertaining and a quick read.  Fans of these type of serial-killer/suspense stories will probably enjoy this book but not find it spectacular; it doesn't quite have enough to raise it to great status. <br /> <br />	2005-06-13
US	43083835	R2HP1CEKHCV9QO	0743497198	300599240	Sahara: A Dirk Pitt Adventure	Books	1	23	36	N	N	Bad...really bad	The last time I read Clive Cussler was around twenty years ago, and the experience had not exactly had me wanting to read more.  Time, however, dulls the memory, and I'm a different reader than I once was.  When I had the opportunity to read Sahara, therefore, I was hopeful that the reading experience would be pleasant; alas, such hopes were to be crushed.  Sahara is not a good book, and reading it, I wonder exactly what makes Cussler such a popular author; maybe it's his exotic locales and his almost non-stop action; it certain isn't his ability to write. <br /> <br />Sahara begins with a pair of prologues, the first dealing with a Confederate warship disappearing at the end of the Civil War, the second focusing on a female pilot crashing in the Sahara back in the 1930s.  We then go to modern times, where Dirk Pitt is called in to investigate a toxic waste runoff that threatens a biological catastrophe that could kill all humanity.  Standing in his way is an evil dictator in Mali who is almost cartoonish in his cruelty and an equally vicious billionaire.  Pitt's adventures will lead him throughout the Sahara in a series of adventures that bring him closer to the truth while battling soldiers and the hostile desert.   <br /> <br />What about the prologue material?  It turns out to have almost nothing to do with the main story.  The crashed plane is a mere plot device to rescue characters at an opportune moment, and the lost ship contributes even less, only really reappearing in something of an epilogue, in which we get some ludicrous distortion of history.  In literary terms, one is a deus ex machina, the other a non sequitir, and any time either one of these appears in a story, it is a substantial weakness.  With both, you have truly bad writing. <br /> <br />The characters themselves are stiff and generally one-dimensional.  The villains are laughable clichs and many of the heroes are little better, and between pure good and pure evil there is a Sahara of sorts with no one to be found.  Then there is Dirk Pitt.  A godlike man who never flinches from danger and always prevails.  Even when we are not seeing him beat the odds, we are having other characters praise him. <br /> <br />There is enough cheesy dialogue to open a deli, but on the plus side, Cussler does have a decent (though not great) ability to describe settings, and his action sequences are often interesting if not really exciting.  Unfortunately, the chief virtue in this book is to make other books seem better in comparison.  For those who think I'm being overly hostile, read the far superior adventure stories of authors such as Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett or even Jon Land.  There are better authors out there; if Sahara is typical Clive Cussler, I strongly recommend skipping his books and going elsewhere. <br />	2005-06-13

It's just sitting out there, and all you have to do is solve a math problem.  Only one of seven.  What could be easier?    Actually, as Keith Devlin points out in his smart little book, there are few things that could be more difficult.  The math problems in question were chosen by the Clay Foundation and represent some of the significant ideas in math today.  Even understanding the problems are a chore, let alone trying to solve them, but Devlin does a good job in explaining them on a layman's level.    At least Fermat's Last Theorem could be easily understood; however, it is now proven, and thus not one of the problems in question.  Instead we have things like the Riemann Hypothesis and the P vs. NP Problem and perhaps most exotic, the Hodge Conjecture, which Devlin says states: \\"Every harmonic differential form (of a certain type) on a non-singular projective algebraic variety is a rational combination of cohomology classes of algebraic cycles.\\"  I have a degree in math and I can barely understand that.  Devlin is hard-pressed to sketch out even the bare ideas behind it.    Some of the problems are easier to explain, but no less difficult to solve.  As Devlin asserts, you can't go into this for the money.  Chances are you would need a doctorate in math just to get started, and even then, you might work on one of these problems for decades without solving it.  But the purpose of the award is to pique mathematical interest, and in that sense, it will work, drawing more people into the field.  And in this generally math-averse and math-ignorant world, that can only be a good thing.    And this book is a good thing too.  Given the complex nature of the material discussed, Devlin does a good job of explaining with a light touch, even admitting occasionally that some of the material is beyond even him.  This book may not be a fast ticket to a million dollars, but it is nonetheless rewarding in its own way.	2005-06-13
US	43083835	R2INBSV1QE0IID	0060508191	645242689	Past Due (Victor Carl Series)	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Entertaining thriller	In William Lashner's latest novel, pragmatic lawyer Victor Carl once again finds himself one step away from bankruptcy and one of his few clients - a two-bit crook known as Joey Cheaps - dead.  Cheaps rarely paid his bills when he was alive, and as a dead man, all he leaves Carl is a murder mystery that offers little in the way or rewards and a good chance of killing the attorney himself. <br /> <br />Thus opens Past Due, and what ensues is an entertaining, fast-reading thriller.  Carl, money-hungry but with enough personal integrity to seek Cheaps's killer despite the lack of financial incentives, finds himself entangled in an older murder mystery.  Twenty years earlier, Cheaps assaulted a drug dealer as part of a shakedown, but what was supposed to be a beating turned into a murder.  Two decades later, this crime has come back to haunt him and somehow lead to his death. <br /> <br />With few clues, Carl starts investigating, riling, among others, a major crime boss and a state Supreme Court justice.  The judge has the ability to make Carl's life miserable, but the crime boss threatens to just end it.  Nonetheless, with fatalistic perseverance, Carl pushes on to unearth the truth. <br /> <br />Plotwise, there is little to distinguish Past Due from a number of other mysteries (despite the lawyer protagonist, this is not a legal thriller as very little of the story takes place in a courtroom).  What makes this book distinctive, however, is the strong narration of Carl, a likeable loser with a dry sense of humor.  So if this looks superficially like just another crime novel, you should be pleasantly surprised by this book which stands out among similar fare. <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

Usually, it's a trilogy, as if the writer were incapable of writing a single volume story.  Peter David understands these cliches, and in Woad to Wuin, he once again skewers them.  Woad is the second book featuring Apropos of Nothing, a bitterly pragmatic man who values self-preservation above everything.  Apropos will run away from danger with no qualms and while not evil, is usually selfish enough to disregard the welfare of anyone else. <br /> <br />Woad begins with an opening chapter that is a direct parody of The Lord of the Rings, as Apropos accidentally acquires a magic ring with rather unusual powers.  After disposing of it, the main story begins.  His erstwhile companion Sharee the Weather Weaver returns into his life bearing a magic gem and fleeing a dangerous warrior.  Apropos is forced into assisting her, disrupting his briefly normal life.  Eventually trapped in a desert, both characters look doomed...and then the story twists in a completely different direction that at first seems like a dream but soon proves to be all too real. <br /> <br />I won't go into what the twist is, but in a way, it is the more serious reverse of the comedic first chapter.  In that chapter, we saw Apropos giving up an object of power; now we see what happens if he winds up using it.  Although not a ring, the magic gem - the Eye of the Beholder - is essentially the parallel of Tolkien's One Ring; if Frodo had seized the Ring for his own benefit to gain power, he would have a fate similar to Apropos's. <br /> <br />Although a parody of fantasy, Woad is not all humor, and in fact, as we get deeper and deeper into the story, the humor takes more and more of a back seat, generally being limited to some puns that are amusing but not overwhelming.  David is not revisiting ground that other fantasy parodists (Anthony, Asprin, etc.) have walked on but instead goes off in his own direction and is the more successful for it.  If you're not familiar with the conventions of this genre, this book may not be the best one to be introduced, but otherwise, this is an excellent novel and well-worth the read. <br />	2005-06-13

Though called a history, there is not much real historical education that one can get from this book.  Instead, we get tales of the more sensational crimes with just enough vague discussion about trends in homicide to justify the \\"history\\" title.   <br /> <br />That might have been okay.  I actually picked up this book for the sensational aspects, not really hoping for any great insights.  Unfortunately, the author Colin Wilson is not a very good writer, and he drains a lot of the life out of this work, making it not more than a two-star effort. <br /> <br />Wilson's biggest problem is that he thinks he's a better writer than he really is.  So what we get is a lot of shallow sociological and psychological commentary that is of doubtful value and is generally boring.  He also interjects himself into the book quite a bit, removing any objectivity a work like this should have.  In addition, he can be redundant. <br /> <br />Add to this the lack of an index or any sort of notes or bibliography, and this book is neither good as a history or as entertainment.  The stories themselves often merit enough interest to make the book semi-readable, but generally, this is a book to not even start.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

Washington and Lincoln both have their proponents, with others arguing for someone else.  A more interesting - or at least more amusing - debate focuses on who was the worst president ever.  Usually at the top (or bottom) of this list are a pair of antebellum executives: Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan.  Of these, Pierce is often given the dubious honor of \\"worst ever\\" but upon consideration, I think I will have to give the title to Buchanan. <br /> <br />Both men were awful presidents, contributing almost nothing positive while exacerbating events that would eventually lead to the Civil War.  They were both pro-Southern Northerners (Buchanan from Pennsylvania, Pierce from New Hampshire), which led to their elections as candidates with wide geographical appeal, but their reluctance to take a strong stance on the divisive issues of the day - in particular, slavery and related problems - would eliminate any real hopes for peace. <br /> <br />What makes Buchanan worse than Pierce?  Is it his support for the Dred Scott decision, his improper recognition of the Lecompton Consitution of Kansas or his weak initial response to the secession movement.  Yes, to all these, but one thing stands out even more.  Pierce was an inexperience politician plagued by family issues, so his ineptness could be expected.  Buchanan, on the other hand, was a veteran politician, with decades of experience in various national posts including Secretary of State and U.S. Senator.  The fact that he failed to use his skills as president - and often abdicated his responsibilities on domestic matters - makes him worse than the overmatched Pierce. <br /> <br />Jean Baker's brief biography of Buchanan (part of the American Presidents series) illustrates the failures of the Buchanan presidency and demonstrates that experience itself is no guide as to who will make a good president; his successor, Lincoln, had little political experience but was a much stronger president.  Baker's writing is good and straightforward, and given the restraints of this series of books (limiting the volumes to around 150 pages each), she is quite detailed without being tedious.  A more comprehensive biography by Philip Klein does exist, but Buchanan may not be worth the effort of a larger book unless you're a real fan of history.  For most readers, Baker's book will be quite satisfactory. <br />	2005-05-03
US	43083835	R3QYCRYG6GHACV	0375421904	297408294	Shakespeare After All	Books	5	65	75	N	Y	Insightful and entertaining	As a fan of Shakespeare (both on the stage/screen and written page), I have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright.  First there was Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare, which was a well-written commentary on the historical contexts of the plays.  Then, there was Harold Bloom's Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, a scholarly work offset by a tone of high-toned intellectual snobbery and condescension.  Now, there is Shakespeare After All, a work that fits between these two in quality. <br /> <br />In Shakespeare After All, Marjorie Garber's 900+ page tome on the Bard's plays, we are given an opportunity to learn more of what makes Shakespeare Shakespeare.  As a long-time Harvard and Yale lecturer on Shakespeare, Garber certainly has the credentials and experience to back up her extensive essays on the plays.  If there is a problem with the book, it is only that she is perhaps too familiar with the plays and is unable to be truly critical of them. <br /> <br />The book begins with a lengthy introduction which serves as a biography of Shakespeare and provides a bit of historical context for his body of work.  Then we get a chapter on each of thirty-eight plays, including The Two Noble Kinsmen, which is not always included in Shakespeare collections.  The plays are presented in rough chronological order and focus only secondarily on plot, with a greater emphasis on character and the use of language.   <br /> <br />Garber is a good writer, and each chapter is insightful.  As this is written more as a collection of essays, there is not always perfect continuity between chapters and there is more than a little redundancy (which I suppose does make this easier to read this work in portions or out of order). As stated before, however, the principal flaw in her writing is that she refuses to say anything really critical about any of the plays.  In Garber's view, Shakespeare batted 1.000, all hits and no misses.  Henry VIII seems to be just as worthy of merit as Othello or Hamlet.   Furthermore, there are no mistakes; any apparent contradictions or omissions are cleverly intended, not just an error. <br /> <br />Certainly, Shakespeare is worth a lot of praise.  When you consider what he did - writing over three dozen plays with an adeptness that is readily apparent - he is definitely deserving of the title \\"genius,\\" but he wasn't perfect.  It would be nice if Garber acknowledged this, but her strengths clearly outweigh her weaknesses, and if you are interested in learning more about Shakespeare's plays, this is a worthwhile way to get that education. <br />	2005-05-03
US	43083835	R3AG6YYWJZHG4Q	0345452593	660919237	Therapy	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Okay, but far from spectacular	I've been reading Jonathan Kellerman for a long time.  In the early days, he was quite good; later, he slipped into mediocrity, but eventually he got back into something of a groove.  Therapy, his latest Alex Delaware novel to make it into paperback, is not his strongest work, but it is far from his weakest, too. <br /> <br />This story begins with Alex and his cop buddy Milo having a meal and hearing police cars go by.  Out of curiosity, Milo decides to see what is going on, and finds himself involved in a double murder.  A twenty-year old man and his apparent girlfriend (her identity is unclear) have both been shot to death; in addition, she has been impaled by an iron spike.  With Alex's assistance, Milo begins investigating.   <br /> <br />The male victim had suffered from a brain injury which made him go to therapy; Alex's discussions with this therapist soon point to another patient of hers who died in a similar manner.  When the therapist is also murdered, some sort of conspiracy seems to be apparent.  Most of the rest of the story involves untangling this conspiracy. <br /> <br />Kellerman makes the story interesting, but there are some flaws.  As is typical with his later books, there is very little action.  In addition, outside of Milo and Alex, there are no strong recurring characters.  The novel actually hearkens back to the early days of mystery, when the investigator is almost faceless and the strength of the book is based on the wit of the narrator (such as with Raymond Chandler, or more recently, Sue Grafton).  The narrators are essentially observers wandering into a soap opera of new characters. The problem here is that Alex doesn't have the sharp wit of a Philip Marlowe or Kinsey Milhone, so we are left with only a relatively routine plot.   <br /> <br />I don't have any easy solutions for solving these problems, but perhaps a start would be to get Delaware back into treating children; his role as a child psychologist is hardly mentioned anymore and is no longer used to draw him into mysteries; instead, he is merely dragged into the crimes by Milo.   <br /> <br />This is an okay book, but the aforementioned flaws prevent it from being truly good.  I can't really recommend it while there are stronger novels out there, but if you pick it up - or if you are a Kellerman fan - you might enjoy it. <br />	2005-05-03
US	43083835	R1U0F4HHMGNKX3	0451214625	118205425	The Prince of Beverly Hills (Rick Barron Novel)	Books	2	4	4	N	N	Fast-reading but problematic	There once was a time when Stuart Woods was a good writer.  Nowadays, he seems to be little more than passable, and it often seem that the only reason I'm still reading his books are (a) the hope that he will return to previous form and (b) they remain quick reads.  In his latest book, The Prince of Beverly Hills, we are treated to a new character and setting, but it is the same old Woods, aspiring to be little more than a simple beach read. <br /> <br />In Prince, we are introduced to Rick Barron, a Beverly Hills cop in 1939 who happens upon a drunk driving accident involving A-list actor Clete Barrow.  Barron covers up the crime and is rewarded with a high level studio security job, along with a new home and car.  Not unlike Woods series character Stone Barrington, success just seems to come naturally to Barron.  Although he needs to contend with a mid-level gangster named Chick Stampano (an obvious fictional version of real-life criminal Johnny Stompanato) and various real organized crime figures, this almost seems to be a distraction from Barron's life of glamor and girls. <br /> <br />As usual, Woods tells a pretty straightforward story with minimal twists.  The story is a minor diversion but far from great literature.  Perhaps most annoying in this book is Woods's inability to create any real variety in names.  Almost all his characters are similarly named, with many having double-r's, including Barrow, Barron (only one letter difference!), Harris, Morrison and Terry, with almost everyone else having some other double-letter combination.  I suppose there could be some sort of joke behind this, but I'm missing it. <br /> <br />Finally, Woods treats Barrow as a generally good guy and immediately dismisses the fact that this man killed an innocent woman due to his drunk driving; no guilt is ever felt by this character, not because he is some sort of sociopath, but merely because the woman is completely forgotten.  Her death is a mere plot device to get Barron into his new career (and he never has any regrets over using this dead woman to get all his dreams to come true).  There is something distasteful about the whole thing, and demonstrates Woods's inability to create a story with any sort of real depth. <br /> <br />So even if this is a fast read and minimally entertaining, it once again shows that Woods either has fading talents or is not interested in quality writing.  I may continue to check out his books - in hope of the good old days - or I may not; he has been trying my patience for too long.  Even if you're just looking for that beach book to kill some idle hours, you can do better than this completely skippable book. <br />	2005-05-03

The point, of course, is that there is a high amount of ambiguity in the field of economics; for predictive ability, it is not quite as bad as consulting tarot cards, but it does lack the typically clean rules of a science like physics.  The money (quite literally) is in the economic model that can best predict the future and let investors know what and when to buy and sell.   <br /> <br />The laws of physics works well in virtually all situations, getting only tricky in isolated circumstances (such as black holes).  Economics, on the other hand, has much fuzzier rules in almost all circumstances.  To put it in physics terms, Mandelbrot's contention would be that the science of economics is Newtonian (or maybe even pre-Newtonian) in an Einstein world.  And with medieval rigidity, the powers-that-be will stay with their basic dogma (refining only as necessary) and will dismiss more modern ideas as heresy. <br /> <br />In particular, Mandelbrot points to the fact that economists, by relying on bell-curve models, are failing to plan for extreme swings in the market.  Aberrations in market activity are much more common than these models predict, which points out their flaws.   Mandelbrot's alternative - based on his own work in fractals - is based on something called power laws, which better take into account the \\"natural\\" turbulence of the market. <br /> <br />Mandelbrot is clear that his ideas will not make people richer, but it may keep them from getting poorer by understanding how markets work better.  His writing (or that of his collaborator) is entertaining and informative without getting too technical (these details are saved for the notes).  On the other hand, he is too close to this subject to be truly objective, and I was often left wondering if his ideas were truly better or if he merely did a good job of making them seem like they were.  Even Mandelbrot admits that his ideas may seem heretical, but that in themselves doesn't make them right or wrong.  While good and thought-provoking, this book should be taken more as a well-supported opinion piece than scientific truth.	2005-04-06

Although she claims to still love him, she wants to turn him into the police.  Meanwhile, Gregory's detective friend Sam Purdy is recovering from a heart attack and a marital separation, which doesn't stop him from wanting to be actively involved in this case.  There are other subplots as well, and Stephen White does a good job of meshing them together.  This may not be a \\"great\\" novel, but it is certainly a good one, both entertaining and well-written.   <br /> <br />In this particular novel, White once again shows that although he is not as big a name as Jonathan Kellerman, he is still producing the better novels.  The comparison is appropriate because both authors feature a psychologist who gets involved in murder mysteries.  Both work with (and are friends) with a gruff homicide detective.  Both are narrated principally in the first person. <br /> <br />But where the Kellerman novels have generally gotten blander over the years (although there has been a little improvement of late), White still delivers a good novel.  The reasons for this may be numerous, but I think a big one is the supporting cast.  While Kellerman's Alex Delaware books have really only two strong recurring characters (Delaware and detective Milo Sturgis), White's Alan Gregory has a whole bunch of recurring characters, including cops, colleagues and family.  This gives White's stories a depth that is missing with Kellerman.  The point is that if you enjoy Kellerman, you should enjoy White even more. <br />	2005-04-06
US	43083835	R23XWMSUJCM55O	080505992X	913453045	George Washington: A Life	Books	3	23	25	N	N	Flawed biography	Among the good-to-great Presidents of the United States, there can be a lot of debate as to who is second-best, but number one on the list - both chronologically and in importance - is George Washington.  Yes, he had his problems, including slave ownership and a spotty military success rate, but these are outweighed by his contributions. <br /> <br />In the early United States, there were few unifying figures.  Most of the founders were associated with a certain region or political philosophy.  Other than the elderly Benjamin Franklin, only Washington received the universal respect that was necessary to keep the fragile nation together.  Another figure - John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton or someone else - would not have had the necessary following to keep the United States truly united.  Aware of his role in history, Washington was a careful executive; he correctly recognized that his every action would set precedents. <br /> <br />Willard Sterne Randall's biography of Washington is a flawed piece of work.  On the one hand, he has created a pleasantly readable book.  On the other hand, his focus is almost exclusively on Washington's early years.  The Revolution doesn't really begin until halfway into the book and the Presidency is covered in scarcely more than fifty pages.  It seems almost as if Randall got bored writing after a certain point and started getting sketchier in the details. <br /> <br />Randall also needed a better editor or fact-checker.  Little flaws can be found:  in one place, he wrongly describes Hamilton as being the son of a British admiral; a few pages later, Hamilton is correctly described as the son of a Scottish merchant. <br /> <br />In the end, this is a passable biography, a weak three-star effort.  Those (including myself) seeking a definitive biography of Washington, will need to look elsewhere.  This book is not bad, but it doesn't rate that high. <br />	2005-04-06

Hayes would be an entirely forgettable president, part of the pantheon of minor executives from John Tyler to Millard Fillmore to Benjamin Harrison.  The one thing that makes Hayes stand out is the controversial way he was elected, a controversy we were reminded of in recent years due to the 2000 election. <br /> <br />In the history of the Presidency, there have actually been four questionable elections.  In 1800 and 1824, the elections were thrown to the House where wheeling and dealing overrode democratic principles.  In 1876, as in 2000, the doubts arose in the counting of certain votes and with the disenfranchisement of blacks in the South.  In Hayes vs. Tilden, the iffiness was more-or-less resolved by a committee that was slightly skewed in favor of the Republican Hayes; this slight edge was all he needed. <br /> <br />Hayes, like Bush, would have the legitimacy of his Presidency questioned.  Bush would be able to affirm his rights to the office by winning a second term; Hayes, however, opted for retirement, and would justify his Presidency by his actions, the belief that he would have won in a fair election and his being succeeded by a politically similar James Garfield.  As a President, he was honest and reasonably competent, but did little of historical distinction. <br /> <br />Hans Trefousse's biography is similarly honest and competent but of no great distinction.  Unlike many volumes of the American Presidents Series, Trefousse provides a full (if brief) biography as opposed to focusing solely on Hayes's Presidency.  Indeed, Hayes's single term occupies only around a third of the book.  The principal virtue of this book is that - as probably the first Hayes biography of the century - it offers a comparison to the 2000 election that previous biographies could not have had.  Overall, this is a decently written book that gives some insight into an obscure President. <br />	2005-03-28

Based on this introduction to the author, I am not positive that he will be worth further reading:  Resurrection Dreams is passable but unspectacular horror. <br /> <br />The story starts off with a prologue principally taking place at a science fair for students of all ages.  School nerd Melvin (can a fictional character named Melvin be anything but a nerd?) presents his own experiment: a recently dug up corpse that he intends to electrically bring to life a la Frankenstein.  He fails. <br /> <br />Years later, Melvin - released from institutionalization - is perfecting his resurrection skills by kidnapping young women who are passing through town and trying out various spells.  One finally works, although there are interesting side effects.  Meanwhile, Vicki, the only one of Melvin's classmates to actually treat him nicely, has returned to town as a new doctor.  Melvin, deeply in love with her, plans on using his new skills to make her his eternal lover. <br /> <br />Although Laymon does have his bits of cleverness, overall, his writing is nothing special and is most noteworthy for being quick and readable.  The humor that occasionally pops up seems more unintentional than not.  Generally, the pluses and minuses of this book balance each other out, creating a strictly average horror novel.  There are worse authors out there, but there are also a lot of better ones. <br />	2005-03-28

The Last Juror is Grisham's best effort in many a year. <br /> <br />A back-of-the-book summary is rather misleading:  according to this description, the story is principally about a murderer who gets out of prison and starts killing the jurors who convicted him.  Actually, that is only a small part of the book, and these deaths don't even start till around the last quarter of the book.  What this novel really follows is Willie Traynor, who develops from an aimless part-time reporter to the owner of a small-town paper.   <br /> <br />Traynor - who is also the narrator - is typically more of an observer of events than a participant.  What he observes are the last secluded days of a small southern town before it becomes a part of the larger world.  When Traynor first comes to Clanton around 1970, it is still segregated and filled with typical small-town corruption; a family of moonshiners still are the local crime gang and Vietnam is a distant thought.  When one of the crime family rapes and kills a woman, there is some question if justice will be done.  Although a conviction does follow, the sentence winds up being relatively minimal.  Over the course of a decade, the town changes:  desegregation and Vietnam become controversial subjects and the small-town businesses yield to fast-food franchises and superstores.  And along with these changes, the killer is granted parole and people start dying. <br /> <br />There is a little of a twist at the end, but an experienced mystery reader will have things figured out long before the actual revelation.  That's okay, because in the end, this is not really a thriller or a mystery, but rather a mainstream novel.  And in avoiding his typical story materials, Grisham has written his best book in a long time. <br />	2005-03-11

Instead of abortion, this time the topic is guns.  Unfortunately, the politics wind up being more important than the plot and the result is a book that is merely above average, not really great.<br /><br />The story focuses on recurring character Kerry Kilcannon, the charismatic President saddled with an opposition Congress.  After members of Kilcannon's wife's family are killed in a mass murder with a high-powered gun, Kerry - already an advocate of gun control - steps up the pressure to restrict access to certain weapons.  Opposing him are the Sons of the Second Amendment (SSA)- an obvious substitute for the NRA - who are extreme in their views and willing to resort to any level of dirty tricks to win.<br /><br />There is a semblance of political balance here, but there are no doubts where Patterson's sympathies lie.  And while these views often parallel my own, that doesn't make me enjoy this book any more.  Instead, this book often seems to be little more than a slanted political debate.  While not all the pro-gun people are villains, all the villains are pro-gun.<br /><br />Anyone who is pro-gun is likely to hate this book and it's not good enough to win anyone over.  Certainly, when compared to another recent political novel that I've read - Michael Crichton's State of Fear - Patterson's novel shines.  Both emphasize politics over plot (although with distinctly different viewpoints), but at least Patterson's characters are more than talking heads.  Indeed, Patterson is a good enough author to make this a high-three star effort, but it is nonetheless a weak book for him.	2005-03-11
US	43083835	RVOVSON5AZ8FO	0425039080	67210777	Man In The High Castle	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Classic novel	The Man in the High Castle is considered Dick's masterpiece, a tale of a world where the Axis won World War II and the United States has been partitioned among the winners.  It's a plot that has been done in different ways, with a variation on the theme done as recently as Philip Roth's Plot Against America, but Dick was one of the first to explore the idea, and he does it in his own special way.  Especially amusing is his book within the book, a novel written by the title character which speculates on a world where the Axis lost the war.  It is not the \\"real\\" world, but rather the reflection of a reflection through a warped mirror:  things may be facing the right direction, but they are a bit distorted at the same time. <br /> <br />As is typically the case in a Dick story, it is the characters that are important more than the plot.  Dick is not interested in adventure or suspense, but rather in showing how people react in extraordinary situations.  There are few good guys or bad guys, although it is clear that certain institutions - particularly the Nazi government - are evil.   <br /> <br />Dick also explores one of his two great themes: \\"What is reality?\\"  (The other is \\"What is Human?\\").  There are little glimpses here and there that the universe in this story is not the \\"real\\" one.  In fact, artificiality is pervasive in the novel:  people make fake art, assume fake names and pursue fake agendas.   <br /> <br />This is a great novel, filled with interesting insights and sly humor.  If you're looking for whiz-bang space opera, this may not be a good science fiction novel for you; on the other hand, if you want a thoughtful and entertaining book, this is highly recommended. <br />	2005-02-18

The case could be made for a number of different figures, from William the Conqueror through Victoria, with a number of other significant figures, including Henry II, Edward I, Henry V and Henry VIII.  To me, however, the most important monarch was Elizabeth I, last of the Tudors, who reigned in the second half of the 16th Century. <br /> <br />Anne Somerset's even-handed biography follows Elizabeth's entire life, from her birth - a disappointment to her father Henry VIII who wanted a son - through the dangerous years under the reign of her sister Mary (whose brutality earned her the title \\"Bloody Mary), to her own lengthy term as queen.   <br /> <br />Upon assuming the throne, there was a lot of doubt that a woman could handle the position; in the half-millennium since William I, there had only been two female heads-of-state - Matilda and Mary - and neither had been very successful.  Elizabeth, however, would prove quite effective; this would not exactly be a success for women's rights, but instead just placed the throne beyond sex to some extent.  During her reign, the religious nature of England itself was transformed, the country became a greater European power and from a cultural standpoint - most notably through the rise of Shakespeare - her reign was a period of growth. <br /> <br />Somerset is a good if not spectacular author, covering Elizabeth's life in great detail.  Although a positive biography overall, Somerset does not shy away from the negatives.  The marriage intrigues, the battles with Spain and France, the incomplete romances with Essex and others, the complicated relationship with Mary Queen of Scots...all are covered.  If you want a good, detailed account of Elizabeth's life, this book will fit the bill.   <br />	2005-02-18

Although some small liberties are taken here or there, the stories typically emphasize real science, or at least science that is possible as an extension of what we currently know.  Unfortunately, this stress on the science often forces a sacrifice of more common plot elements such as character.  In sci-fi terms, hard science fiction is kind of like a sophisticated robot: it exhibits intelligence and it moves, but it is also rather cold. <br /> <br />With this description in mind, Earth by David Brin is standard hard sci-fi.  The story takes place around 2040 and focuses on the discovery of a miniature black hole in the center of the Earth.  The black hole is slowly growing, and if not stopped, it will destroy the world within a few years.  While some characters - led by genius scientist Alex Lustig - work to solve this problem, others try to exploit the situation for various agendas: either military or environmental. <br /> <br />This is an ambitiously written story, sprawling from outer space to the core of the Earth, with different plot elements tangling and untangling.  In a way, it is too ambitious:  with all the jumps from one setting to another, it's hard to maintain focus.  In addition, though the characters are distinctive (for the most part), they are not extremely interesting.  The book is driven by the ideas, not by any real interest in the fates of individual characters. <br /> <br />But - as stated before - this is typical of this subgenre of science fiction.  Some authors do better than others to overcome these weaknesses, and Brin is about average in his performance.  For fans of hard sci-fi, this should be a fun read, stylistically reminiscent of John Brunner (in particular Stand on Zanzibar and The Sheep Look Up, both of which Brin acknowledges in the Afterword).  Other readers, however, may be bored or left cold.  I was somewhere between the two and find this a (high) three star effort. <br />	2005-02-18
US	43083835	R3QMHAINOUR6XT	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	2	12	26	N	N	Return of the Talking Heads	State of Fear - Michael Crichton's latest novel - is a sadly typical effort by the author, more of an opinion piece than a piece of fiction.  In this case, Crichton is taking on the theory of global warming and finding it lacking.  Superficially, he does a good job stating his case, but a deeper look exposes some flaws in his arguments.  In the end, however, it doesn't matter if his opinion is right or wrong if he can't deliver a good story and he doesn't. <br /> <br />It's rarely a hopeful sign when a piece of fiction requires footnotes, appendices and a bibliography.  Often times, such devices are used to deal with plausibility issues (who cares if its believable if it's true?), but in Crichton's case, it's because he's more interested in educating than entertaining:  the idea dominates all other elements of the story. <br /> <br />The plot involves an extremist environmental group out to create \\"natural\\" disasters to heighten awareness of global warming.  The main character is a lawyer who is generally supportive of the global warming argument but is swayed slowly by characters who show him flaws in the issue as they stop the disasters from occurring.  Unfortunately, all the characters are little more than talking heads who lecture on various points but have little in the way of real personality.  In addition, the supposed solidity of the anti-global warming argument is undermined by the weakness of the opposition:  the people supporting the concept are shown to be either ignorant or evil:  it's like watching a football game between an NFL team and a high school junior varsity team:  things are stacked so much for the former that the results are never in doubt. <br /> <br />The story itself - when we get a break from discussions on the environment (complete with numerous graphs!) - is often silly, and plays out like a bad James Bond story.  The villains (who are actually rather faceless and boring) use exotic weapons instead of guns and leave the heroes in deathtraps but leave before checking if the traps worked.  After a slow start, the book is at least a fast and occasionally interesting read, but it is barely a two-star effort overall.  I'm willing to read and enjoy books with viewpoints different than my own, but it still has to be well written, and this one isn't.  As either an opinion piece or a work of fiction, this book falls far short of the mark. <br />	2005-01-27

Carrier is a psychologist who is recovering from the murder of his girlfriend, a death that is more devastating because he is a suspect in the crime.  He is drawn out of his funk by two people:  Arthur Chess, a retired pathologist whose mysterious actions start to point Carrier towards the real killer, and Angela Rios, a doctor who he starts dating.<br /><br />As if working a puzzle, Carrier is presented piece by piece the solution to the murder.  This is not a whodunit:  there is no way the reader can figure out the killer before Carrier does.  In addition, the reason behind Carrier's manipulation is not that plausible; there are easier ways to do things that seem to escape the characters.<br /><br />I have said for a while that Alex Delaware has become more and more of a nondescript, boring character (although there has been a little improvement in recent books).  Carrier seems to be Kellerman's attempt to recreate Delaware under a new name.  There is even a cop in this story named Doresh who has a similar gruffness to Milo Sturgis, although Doresh and Carrier have a more antagonistic relationship.<br /><br />The last time Kellerman did a non-Delaware novel, he excelled with Billy Straight; this effort is okay, but not as successful.  Although it does have its problems, this book is a generally entertaining read, neither exceptionally good or bad.  It is strictly a three star work, of more interest to Kellerman fans than to mystery fans in general.	2004-12-09
US	43083835	R1T1NC0HBOUIAS	0312278241	61626848	Blue Horizon	Books	5	24	28	N	N	More Fun from Wilbur Smith	In a certain sense, historical fiction is like science fiction, except one looks forward while the other looks back.  Certainly both genres are wide-ranging in what they cover, not only in terms of topics, but in terms of style.  Look at some of the big names in historical fiction:  James Michener writes epics focusing on the evolution of a place rather than characters; James Clavell writes sagas of intrigue in eastern Asia; John Jakes focuses on U.S. history and writes what may be considered soap operas.  Then there is Wilbur Smith, who uses history as a backdrop to adventure stories. <br /> <br />The somewhat outdated and politically incorrect term for Africa is the Dark Continent, a reference to the fact that it was largely unexplored and mysterious.  To a large extent, this remains true for popular fiction:  Outside of some North African WWII tales, few novels take place on this continent.  Wilbur Smith is the exceptional writer in this regard. <br /> <br />Blue Horizon is a sequel to Smith's previous novels of Birds of Prey and Monsoon, focusing on several generations of the Courtney family, English expatriates who are trying to eke out a living around the South African Cape.  Birds of Prey follows Hal Courtney; Monsoon follows Hal's sons, Tom, Guy and Dorian; Blue Horizon deals with the same characters plus Tom's son Jim and Dorian's son Mansur.  Jim rescues a woman from a convict ship and they both wind up fugitives pursued by bounty hunters.  Meanwhile, Dorian, adopted son of the Omani caliph, must contend with his vicious step-brother who has ascended to the throne. <br /> <br />The focus in this story is on adventure as the heroes move from one perilous situation to another.  \\"Heroes\\" is definitely the right word, as these are definitely good guys; similarly, their foes are unquestionably evil.  It is obvious that Smith, despite his historical context, is not all that interested in realism, but that's okay; that's not what you look for in such a book.  Similarly, the extremely progressive attitude of the protagonists - anti-slavery and completely tolerant of other races and religions - may be a little optimistic from a historical standpoint, but Smith makes it work. <br /> <br />Actually, if there is a lesson to come out of this book, it is that these attitudes actually do pay off, as the heroes are able to achieve success as a result of their positive qualities; the villains, on the other hand, can only achieve victory through force, resulting in a less lasting success.  But such lessons are secondary to what this book is all about:  fun and adventure, and in this area, Smith is successful enough to rate five stars. <br />	2004-12-09
US	43083835	RAC724XW5KLDS	0345391691	920269539	The Battle for God	Books	4	23	26	N	N	The fundamentals of Fundamentalism	In The Battle for God, Karen Armstrong once again examines the history of the three big monotheistic religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism.  This time, her focus is on the development of fundamentalism within these three faiths. <br /> <br />To provide a history of fundamentalism, first it must be defined.  It means different things to different religions, but Armstrong finds similarities between the different types.  To her, fundamentalism arises out of a conflict between \\"mythos\\" and \\"logos\\"; or in simplest terms, faith and reason.  As the 20th century shifted to a more \\"rational\\" world - one based more on scientific principles - it seemed like faith would be driven into a quiet corner, never to emerge again.  Unfortunately, complete rationality has a certain sterile feel and creates a void which fundamentalism fills. <br /> <br />Armstrong focuses on several types of fundamentalism, allowing the reader to see their similarities and differences.  In particular, she focuses on the fundamentalists in American Protestantism, Israeli Judaism, Egyptian Sunni Islamism and Iranian Shiite Islamism.  Her history begins in the Renaissance and goes to the present day. <br /> <br />While it is clear that Armstrong is no advocate of fundamentalist agendas, she also shows an understanding as to the motives of the movement and does not merely dismiss fundamentalists as idiots or crackpots; indeed, she shows that such dismissals accomplish little and can actually give the fundamentalists greater strength. <br /> <br />As with any book on religion, this one is sure to not be liked by everyone.  What seems to be a generally objective look at fundamentalism will probably be dismissed by others as anti-religious.  Armstrong also aims her book at a relatively sophisticated audience, and the concepts she deals with are not always easy to grasp.  For an American reader who can see the influence of religion in the 2004 presidential election, this book offers some good insights.  It is not perfect, and it is not always an easy read, but it is a solid four star book. <br />	2004-11-19
US	43083835	R1NDJ9SDOMCGIS	0451192249	280101697	The House	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Good, but not Little's best	Bentley Little is a horror writer, but it would actually be better to say he is two horror writers.  For some of his books, he writes a straightforward horror story , which - while well-written - is similar to the output of a number of other authors.  In other books, however, he uses horror as a device for satire, and in these works, he has carved his own niche in the genre.  He can take an ordinary concept:  insurance or a superstore or a homeowners association and take it to a terrifying extreme.  When I pick up a Little book, I always look for one of his sharp satires, but if I get a more standard story, I know I will still get a good read. <br /> <br />The House is one of these straightforward horror stories, principally unusual in its telling.  Essentially, the House is five parallel stories of characters who - although they have little in common - have similarly haunted pasts.  Each character is separately compelled to go to the house of their childhood; though each character grew up in different locations, there are some distinct similarities between the houses. <br /> <br />While decent enough, this is not one of Little's better works.  The lack of a central character is part of the problem.  Things could also be explained a bit better: it's one thing to have ambiguities and its another thing to be unclear, and sometimes this book tends toward the latter.  Nonetheless, this is an entertaining read, imperfect but good enough to merit a weak four stars.  As an introduction to Little, you are probably better with one of his more clever satires such as The Policy or The Ignored, but if you are looking for a straight horror novel, this will be a pleasant diversion. <br />	2004-09-29
US	43083835	R3U6VIC7GR31C0	0195056868	387290390	The Great Triumvirate: Webster, Clay, and Calhoun	Books	4	28	30	N	Y	The big three in antebellum America	In the first half of the 19th century, American politics was dominated by the Congress, with only one really strong president (Andrew Jackson) in the era between Jefferson and Lincoln.  Perhaps the largest figures in this period were the so-called \\"Great Triumvirate\\" of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John Calhoun.  Serving in both houses of Congress, various presidential cabinets and (in Calhoun's case), the Vice Presidency, these three were the architects of the era.  Only the Presidency itself would elude their ambitions. <br /> <br />All three were born at roughly the same time, entered Congress around the same time and died within a couple years of each other.  They represented the three regions of antebellum America: Webster was in the North, Clay the West and Calhoun the South.  They were often at odds with each other, even when they were in agreement on a subject. <br /> <br />Webster was probably the least significant of the three.  Known for his oratory and intellect, he led primarily by example.  His constant financial problems put him in some ethically dubious situations.  Calhoun was renowned for his integrity but - although he never lived to see it - provided a lot of the theoretical basis for the secession movement that eventually resulted in the Civil War.  Clay was probably the most blatantly ambitious of the three, but also the best deal-maker.  Among his many accomplishments (often shared with others) were the Treaty of Ghent, the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850.  Some of these may have be problematic to modern eyes, but these Compromises helped delay the Civil War.  Although this may have not been Clay's design, the delay allowed the North to develop enough resources to win the war, which may have not been possible a decade earlier. <br /> <br />This book actually serves as three parallel biographies that occasionally intertwine.  While generally interesting and informative, it is also a somewhat ponderous read.  In addition, whilethe book does a good job at looking at the three as individuals, it is sometimes lacking in describing them as a trio.  For better works about this era and its participants, I recommend Robert Remini, who has written biographies of Clay and Webster along with Andrew Jackson.  Despite the flaws in this work, it is still at least a solid four stars for the information it does present, so you can't go too wrong reading it if the subject matter interests you. <br />	2004-09-29
US	43083835	R1DJC7MDP32VCE	0786708875	840830330	The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Mammoth Books)	Books	2	14	14	N	N	Could have been good, but it ain't	This book, both by title and description, purports to be a reference source on the genre of science fiction.  In some ways, it is exactly that, but unfortunately, it has such glaring omissions that it is more of a novelty than a good source of information.    On the plus side is the organization of the book, which is essentially broken down into four sections:  a brief history of SF, a listing of authors and their major works, a listing of significant science fiction movies and a glossary of key topics in the genre (aliens, robots, etc.).  This format makes the book easy to read either end-to-end or just randomly (although an end-to-end read will be diminished a bit by redundancies).  In addition, the author is a decent enough writer to make this a relatively pleasant read.    Unfortunately, the omissions in this book are so apparent that they make the reader question the author's true knowledge of the genre.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the section on authors, where such prominent science fiction names as Piers Anthony, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Keith Laumer and Clifford Simak (one of the legends in the field) are missing while much more obscure authors get space.  This is not a judgement on the quality of the authors either mentioned or forgotten, merely their level of contribution to the genre.  In addition, there are cases where plot descriptions are inaccurate.    While an interesting read, the flaws in this book are so significant and obvious that it cannot rate any higher than two stars.  While this might give a reader a glimpse into the world of science fiction, it is a distorted glimpse, like through a piece of flawed glass:  you can get a lot of the details, but the overall picture is a mess.	2004-09-29
US	43083835	RY87ONCWK45RA	067003133X	929452996	The Bounty: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Entertaining history	A man commits a crime.  When the community finds out, he is condemned.  Then, the man and his family do a little spin control, and suddenly, he turns out to be a hero (or at least a victim) to a large segment of the population and the victim becomes the villain.  We see it in the news all the time today, but it is hardly a new phenomenon; as shown in The Bounty, the criminal-as-wronged-individual is a centuries-old idea. <br /> <br />The Bounty is part history, part true crime story.  Set in the late 18th century world of maritime trade and warfare, The Bounty tells the story of the most famous mutiny in history.  As in a true crime story, the actual act takes a mere few pages, but it is the central act in the tale.  The events leading up to the mutiny and the actions taken afterward by both sides fill up the rest of the book. <br /> <br />The myth of the Mutiny of the Bounty has Captain William Bligh as the villain and the mutinous Fletcher Christian as the hero (how could a man named Christian be anything less than heroic?).  Bligh's name has become synonymous with tyrannical behavior, yet The Bounty shows that there was nothing exceptional about his behavior:  in an era when ships' captains were tyrants, Bligh was no saint, but he may have actually been a little better than average.  In this book, the sympathies are definitely with Bligh, especially after he and his loyalists are abandoned on a small craft and must undergo a harrowing trip over 3000 miles of mostly open water.  That Bligh was pivotal in almost everyone surviving this trip makes Bligh the true hero in this book.  Fletcher Christian, on the other hand, often comes off as an irrational or just an ingrate. <br /> <br />Well-documented, The Bounty is both entertaining and educational.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen was an epilogue dealing with the various movies and books that have been about this event.  Nonetheless, this is a very good book and a worthwhile read for those interestedin this subject. <br />	2004-09-03

What I got was a book that was filled with a lot of interesting facts but was only intermittently well-written. <br /> <br />The premise of the book - only half-believed by the author himself - seems to be that the creation of rock was somehow tied to a pact with Satan, resulting in a curse that afflicted the business, resulting in death and tragedy for many artists.  The principal character in this story is Robert Johnson, who supposedly sold his soul for musical talent and eventually became one of the progenitors of rock and roll.  As the genre developed, the deaths started occurring, beginning with \\"the day the music died\\" when Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and the Big Bopper all died in a plane crash.  This led to a string of deaths that were all tied together by dark coincidences.  Besides Johnson, the other principal character in this saga of rock is a satanist named Alisteir Crowley who rose to prominence in the early 1900s and later had influence on some of the biggest names in music. <br /> <br />For the most part, this book doesn't really assert these myths are facts, just a conspiracy theory developed by rock fans piecing together random facts to find patterns where none truly exist.  Nonetheless, the author Patterson doesn't spend much time refuting many of these myths (although he does question the truth of some of them, especially the one on backward tracks) even if they are presented in a somewhat skeptical manner.  <br /> <br />Patterson also is not the greatest of writers, with a tendency to lean on the same words over and over again.  The word \\"ironic\\" appears around once every other page or so, and not always appropriately; it sometimes seems he uses it as a synonym for another overused word, \\"coincidental.\\"  Is this a great book?  No, but it is a good one, a strong three starts, filled with enough entertaining facts to offset the weaknesses in presentation.  If you're interested in the myths of rock history, this is a recommended read. <br />	2004-09-03
US	43083835	R1W6NLJNL5E53S	0743453956	213780897	Executive Power (Mitch Rapp )	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Good story, offset by so-so pacing	Vince Flynn's latest thriller has government assassin Mitch Rapp taking on terrorists in a novel that is unevenly paced but is nonetheless a fun read.<br />The plot has a Palestinian terrorist named David creating an escalating series of events with the intent of forcing the creation of a Palestinian state.  While in certain ways a man of integrity (he does not directly target innocents), he also is aware that his acts will beget additional, less discriminate violence.  Meanwhile, Rapp is off in the Philippines, taking on different Islamic terrorists who are holding a family hostage and have already killed members of a previous rescue mission.<br />Flynn keeps things moving, but the big flaw in the story is the pacing.  The rescue/revenge mission in the Philippines is clearly a secondary (and independent) plot, yet it dominates over half the book.  By the time Rapp gets involved in the main story, it is already around page 300.  That's a long time to get the story to kick into full gear, and it's only Flynn's adept writing that is able to overcome this problem.<br />While it is not essential, it is helpful to have read the other in the Mitch Rapp series to fully enjoy this book.  While not exceptional enough to merit five stars, this novel is a solid four star effort and a good way to be entertained for a few hours.	2004-06-23
US	43083835	R2RQ0WGY4BCS8B	0312989423	645604671	Hollywood Tough (Shane Scully Novels)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Passably entertaining, but little more than that	Stephen Cannell for years was one of the big figures in television, the creator of such quality shows as the Rockford Files and such pieces of silliness as the A Team.  Of late, however, his focus has been on novel writing, and while his books have never been great works of art, they also have been relatively fun reads.  Unfortunately, Hollywood Tough, Cannell's latest Shane Scully novel, is much more A Team than Rockford Files.<br />There are actually three storylines going on in this book.  In one, Shane suspects his wife's friend's fiancee of being a murderer based on an offhand comment.  In the second plot line, his wife is involved with investigating a gang murder.  Finally, Shane works undercover as a movie producer to bring down a New Jersey mobster trying to make it big in Hollywood.<br />This story tends to read more like a TV crime drama than a mystery novel.  This makes it a fast, easy read but with no real depth.  There is no real sense of plausibility:  Shane goes undercover, but never really tries to learn anything about his role before he starts his work; he just makes it up as he goes along.  There are no really good villains, and most of the characters are walking cliches, especially when dealing with the Hollywood types.  It is too silly to be realistic, and too unsubtle to be satire.<br />Clumsy as the writing is at times, Cannell retains enough of his ability to entertain to make this at least a so-so novel: it's worth three stars but barely.  This one is best for Cannell fans; others should look elsewhere for a more well-written thriller.	2004-06-16
US	43083835	R2F2QUBAGKETEP	0446531634	375922512	The Rules of Silence (Lindsey, David)	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Entertaining but flawed	After having been disappointed in David Lindsey's last book, Animosity, I approached The Rules of Silence with at least some trepidation.  Was Animosity a fluke or an indicator of a downward trend in Lindsey's writing?  The answer was hard to say:  on the one hand, The Rules of Silence is a far better book, but it also suffers from some of the same flaws as the earlier book.<br />In this novel, Titus Cain, a wealthy software entrepreneur, is targeted for extortion by a vicious and very well-organized thug.  While Cain seeks help from a mysterious anti-terrorism expert named Burden, his friends start dying.  As Burden takes over, Cain is caught in the middle, manipulated by both sides:  even as the extortionist makes him jump through hoops, Burden - a do-gooder willing to kill innocents if it means elimination a major terrorist - has Cain doing things that grate on the businessman's conscience.<br />Interestingly, the big problem with this book is exactly the same as in Animosity:  the protagonist is not a man of action but rather reaction.  Cain rarely takes any initiative but merely reacts to the situation.  As a reader, I want to see Cain actually do something; instead, it is Burden who is called in to save the day, and Cain is just along for the ride.  In a suspense novel, we may expect the main character to try and depend on an authority figure, but we also anticipate that in the end, it'll be the hero who will succeed or fail, not his substitutes.  <br />The story itself is pretty exciting although there are very few plot twists.  The principal villain is a nasty piece of work, and is probably the most interesting character in the whole novel.  The fact that this is a generally fun and fast read goes a long way to offset its critical flaws, and overall, I'd have to rate this as a good, but not great book...a weak four stars.  For fans of Lindsey, this is a mixed success, but it is generally an improvement and should encourage readers to try another of his booksin the future.	2004-06-16

With their silly name and their lack of any sort of substantial contribution to the political scene, the Know-Nothings deserve their minor standing, but a history of this political party does impart some lessons, both in history and in the nature of politics.<br />The Know Nothings - a name used by both themselves and their foes - started out as a semi-secret fraternal organization in the 1850s that was distinctly anti-immigrant.  In particular, an anti-Catholic sentiment united the Know Nothings, and in an era of high immigration rates, they were able to rise in popularity quickly.  Outside their religious intolerance, they did hold some values that are easier to identify with, including a belief in temperance and most importantly, an opposition to slavery.<br />With the decline of the Whigs, the Know Nothings filled a void.  They were also against political corruption, which combined with their anti-slavery views (at least in the North), elevated them a number of state and federal offices in 1854 and 1855.  Unfortunately, once in power, they became just as political as those they once opposed, and the anti-slavery Know Nothings began to defect to the new Republican party.  In short, by 1856, they were just another political party; their presidential candidate - the deservedly obscure ex-President Millard Fillmore - carried only one state.  With a lack of organization and the loss of its core ideas, the party was gone by the time of the Civil War.<br />Even if the Know Nothings didn't directly contribute a lot in a historical sense, they do offer lessons in the difficulty of third parties in the United States.  A party may be able to burst to a fad-like popularity based on the power of a single personality (such as Teddy Roosevelt with the Bull Mooses or more recently, Ross Perot with the Reform Party) or a single idea (such as the nativist Know Nothings), but eventually, like any fad, it fades away to obscurity.  Sustained success requires a level of \\"selling out\\" which inevitably disillusions those drawn to the party in the first place and leads them back to a major party that may also be \\"sold out\\" but at least offers the opportunity of victory.<br />The book itself is well-written, although the overall significance of the Know Nothings is a little overstated.  With a subject that could be tedious, we instead get something that - while it may not be a beach read - is both readable and informative.

US	43083835	R2TR7AA9F0KQ1C	074721624X	260699170	The Store	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Good but imperfect	At first glance, The Store might appear to be a rehash of Stephen King's Needful Things.  Both deal with rather sinister shops, but the similarities essentially end there.  Bentley Little's novel is a dark satire that is well-written and suspenseful, although it does fall apart a little at the end.<br />The story focuses on Bill Davis, whose family resides in the small Arizona town of Juniper.  Juniper is one of those middle-of-nowhere towns in which there is not much in the way of shopping choices, and in fact, most of the times, the residents must go out of town to get what they need.  Into this sleepy village comes The Store, a generically-named, sinister (but obvious) version of Wal Mart.  The Store offers a great selection and low prices.  Unfortunately, The Store also offers much more to those who wander down the wrong aisles: racist video games, snuff films and cheap explosives.  It also has a rather rigid employment policy which requires dark rituals to get hired and severe consequences for disobedience or quitting.  Then there are the mysterious Night Managers...<br />As with most of Little's best novels, this succeeds both as horror novel and satire.  It is exciting reading, but as with many horror novels, the ending is a bit weak.  Also, while we are expected to suspend our disbelief for supernatural fiction, there should at least be plausibility, and in some of the events of this story, such plausibility is a bit lacking.  These flaws keep The Store from being a great book, but it is still pretty darn good and - though not Little's best effort - it is a fun read.	2004-03-25

While that case is somewhat circumstantial, what is more open-and-shut is her client's murder of his previous attorney, a brutal killing that has made most others reluctant to defend him.  Jaffe, however, is willing to take him on and in the process, do battle with her own demons.<br />As usual, Margolin is an adept writer, though this is far from his best work, as most of his plot twists are either rather easy to figure out (such as who is entangled in the conspiracy) or out of left field (such as the final solution of the whodunit).  On the other hand, Margolin has presented his most clever villains since Gone But Not Forgotten, which does make the story exciting even as its ending seems foreshadowed.  Jaffe herself is a well-defined character, and unlike most series characters, she doesn't just shake off the traumas she has previously undergone.<br />Overall, I'd say this was a good, but not great, book.  Those who read less suspense novels may be more surprised by the plotting, but for veteran readers of the genre, this will be a bit predictable.  Nonetheless, fans of thrillers should be generally pleased with Margolin's latest effort	2004-03-03
US	43083835	R1N933PGYF4CBS	0743417682	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A lesser King effort	Stephen King's latest non-series novel is a passable but not very exceptional book that captures most of what makes Stephen King books great without actually being great itself.  In part, this is due to the book being something of a rehash of his older books, in particular, Christine (evil car), the Tommyknockers (ancient alien artifact) and the Green Mile (a team of law officers holding a secret).  Unlike the wholly mediocre Dreamcatcher - another King novel that revisits old themes - this one is at least okay, although it is not much more than that.<br />The story is mostly related as a prolonged flashback about some small town state police who acquire an abandoned car.  The man who abandoned it has disappeared and the car itself is distinctly unusual in appearance.  Shortly after putting it in storage, one of the officers disappears as well.  Over the coming days and years, the car does some strange things, occasionally radiating vast amounts of light or spewing out alien creatures which die quickly.<br />The biggest problem with this current book is that not much goes on.  Yes, there is a strange car, and yes, it does strange - and dangerous - things, but it only does a few actions of any significance, and there is rarely a sense of real menace about the car.  Most of the story deals with trying to solve the mysteries of the car, which are considerable.  Nonetheless, there is also a sense that it's little more than a mild distraction to these characters, kind of like a sleeping tiger in a cage that only represents a threat if you are in the cage with it at the same time it is awake.  Otherwise, it is merely interesting.  In addition, the characters themselves are almost all blandly benevolent; the few nasty characters which King does so well appear only briefly.  <br />There is a saying in the book - used several times - that curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.  Unfortunately, the book itself, while peaking my curiosity, did not really satisfy.  I will be back, nonetheless.  King is good enough to merit additional readings, but I hope that they are better than this one.	2004-03-03

Although it has a few imperfections, it is still well worth a five-star review.<br />Gould is up front about any potential bias he may have, declaring early on that he is a Democrat.  Despite this (or maybe because of this), he has written a reasonably objective history, with his own political slant relatively limited.  Most of his criticisms are not so much aimed at particular political viewpoints as with how various Republicans have executed their ideas over the years.  Figures such as Taft, Coolidge and Nixon are shown more positively than usual, while Reagan - the supreme deity in the Republican pantheon - is viewed a little more critically.<br />The main theme of this book is the complete shift in political thought that the Republicans have undergone in their 150 years of existence, going from the \\"liberal\\" party that was highly nationalistic and an advocate of centralized power to the more conservative party it is today, with its emphasis on states' rights and limited government.  Gould traces this transformation and indicates the pivotal points, perhaps none greater than Teddy Roosevelt's splitting of the party in 1912, driving out the more progressive members and shifting the balance within.<br />While a great book, this book is not perfect.  In particular, I would have liked a deeper look into the Whigs, who were in many ways the precursors of the Republicans.  Nonethless, for those interested in the political history of the U.S., this book - along with its companion history of the Democrats, Party of the People - is a worthwhile read.	2004-03-03

Once again, Grisham has put together a book that is reasonably entertaining and fast-moving while not being all that well-written.  The story is the essentially Faustian story of a struggling lawyer who sells his soul for prosperity, rising to great heights by compromising his integrity.  He has it all - wealth, fame, a beautiful model for a girlfriend - but like all deals with the devil, it eventually all goes sour in a big way.<br />In Clay Carter, Grisham reworks many of the protagonists from his previous novels.  Clay is morally and ethically challenged (not unlike the \\"heroes\\" of The Firm, The Runaway Jury and The Brethren).  He thinks he's an okay guy, but in the end, he gives in to greed and is willing to sell out almost anyone in his climb to the top.  Unfortunately, Clay is the only well-defined character in the book; many characters, such as his long-time girlfriend, are not all that interesting (it's hard to understand why Clay is so obsessed with her), and other characters (such as her parents) are little more than cookie-cutter stereotypes.<br />This is an okay book and a page-turner, but hardly more than three-star quality.  For Grisham veterans, this will be not a disappointment or a pleasure, but merely par for the course for a writer is just slightly above par, and as strong an indication as any that being a best-selling author is not the same as being a great one.	2004-02-19

A year or so back I finally read a book on the period that was disorganized, overly political and just generally not well-written.  It did not exactly make me long to read another book on the subject, but then I saw Age of Gold by H.W. Brands.  Having read his well-written book on Benjamin Franklin, I approached this book with guarded enthusiasm and was very pleased with what I got.<br />Brands's history includes all the pivotal characters of the era:  Sutter, Marshall, Fremont, Stanford and a host of lesser names.  After the discovery of gold, the people poured into California, an area generally isolated from the rest of the world.  For East Coasters, the only ways to get there were three perilous routes:  over the land with the dangers of desert and mountain; by boat and the Panama isthmus, with its disease; or the Cape route, extremely long and with the risky Straits of Magellan.  Those who made it found that easy wealth was not all that easy after all: prospecting was not that simple, there were too many others also seeking the gold and high costs bit deeply into what earnings that people could make.  <br />The myth of the grizzled lone prospector was mostly just that: a myth.  In the end, most of the prospecting was done in cooperative efforts, and gold mining became just another job, akin to farming, except the people were reaping minerals instead of crops.  The impact of the Gold Rush, however, was incredible, as the huge population shift made California qualify for statehood earlier than expected; normally, newly acquired territories grew slowly and took a while to become a state.  California's early qualification created new conflicts between North and South that led to the Compromise of 1850, a stopgap measure that postponed the Civil War for a decade.  In addition, with the creation of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, the United States was truly a coast-to-coast country.<br />Brands is a good writer, both entertating and educational and this is definitely a great read for anyone interested in this period of the American history.	2004-02-19
US	43083835	R1ZHU2ELFLORQP	0330411543	721325086	Reversible Errors	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Decent legal thriller	Reversible Errors is another in Scott Turow's courtroom dramas.  As with his other books, these are not so much thrillers as soap operas set in a legal environment.  In this case, high-priced lawyer Arthur Raven is forced into representing a man on death row.  The guy sure seems guilty - he even confessed repeatedly - but it wouldn't be much of a story if there wasn't some doubt being thrown into the mix.<br />All the characters have so much baggage, they could all get together and start a suitcase store.  Arthur suffers from his own inferiority complex and his obligations to his schizophrenic sister.  His ally and friend (and maybe more) Gillian is an ex-judge and ex-con and ex-heroin addict.  On the opposite side is Muriel, an ambitious prosecutor aiming for the D.A.'s office; her marriages have been shallow and have driven her to affairs.  Her main lover is Larry, a detective who is married himself, but is obsessively in love with Muriel.  The most well-adjusted seems to be Rommy, the simpleton who sits on death row awaiting his execution.<br />Turow does a good job twisting the story back and forth as to Rommy's involvement with the triple murder for which he was convicted.  Nonetheless, any experienced reader of these sorts of books know that anyone who looks as guilty as he does is quite likely innocent.  Yet, even if his innocence is assumed, there is still the matter of proving it before he gets the needle.  The drama that plays out between the four chief characters - Arthur, Gillian, Larry and Muriel - both within and out of the courtroom - are what makes the suspense.  <br />While at times Turow gets a little too melodramatic, in general this is a good page turner.  For fans of these legal novels, this is a decent diversion.	2004-02-19
US	43083835	R3R0YH293GRRQ2	0060011904	452541514	Small Town: A Novel (Block, Lawrence)	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Block delivers again	In many of the novels of Lawrence Block, there is a somewhat hidden character, hidden because it is not a person, but a place:  New York City.  In Small Town, Block brings this character to the forefront, showing how it is recovering from the wounds it received on the infamous September 11.  Block treats the city with a certain reverence and by interweaving the lives of his human characters, demonstrates that there is a certain \\"small-town\\" quality to the big city.  It's a formula that is mostly, but not completely successful.<br />As a long-time fan of Block, this book reminded me of his many books on the art of writing.  First, because of the good writing that once again indicates he's an author who knows his craft.  Second, because in a couple of those books he discusses writing soft porn early in his career, and this novel does have a level of sexual explicitness that is unusual for most of his mysteries.  Third, because one of his characters is a writer, and Block gives a behind-the-scenes look at what such a life could be like.<br />The story itself involves a serial killer whose family died as a result of 9/11 and now is driven by a delusion that the city itself requires sacrifices.  The two principal characters are the writer mentioned above who is suspected of one of the killer's murders and an art gallery owner whose sexual addiction drives her to all sorts of interesting behavior, much of which is described in great detail.  Although never directly involved in the life of the killer, she does become entangled in the lives he has affected.<br />In tone, this is reminiscent of Block's Matthew Scudder novels, which is a good thing, since Block is at best with that series of novels.  As one of his rare excursions into non-series fiction, this is likely to please many of his fans; although not perfect, it is entertaining.	2004-02-19

Although he doesn't always adhere to the laws of physics (his Known Space works rely on hyperspatial travel), he does adhere to as much science as possible.  His primary focus is on human-alien interactions and \\"interesting\\" worlds, with probably none more well-known than his Ringworld.  Even in the featured fantasy stories, there is something of a scientific underpinning to his works.<br />Niven's ideas are often clever and he is a generally proficient writer, which makes his works overall good.  On the other hand, he is not a \\"great\\" writer.  I can't point to many specific examples, but there is something that is stylistically missing that prevents his work from getting to that higher level.  Actually, my main gripe with his style seems to be his descriptive abilities; the concepts he tries to convey are sometimes described unclearly, leaving the reader with only a vague picture of what Niven is trying to show.  In a hard science fiction writer - who relies on these scientific concepts as his bread-and-butter - this is a significant flaw.  Fortunately, it doesn't happen enough to truly mar his overall work.<br />So even if Niven (and this collection) has its imperfections, it is generally good and a fun read.  For Niven fans, or just those who want to see what type of writer he is, this is a recommended read.	2003-12-23

These stories have had an influence on many writers, including Dan Simmons, who with his Kurtz books, is trying his own version of the Parker series.  While reasonably entertaining, Simmons's work in this field is definitely below Westlake/Stark in caliber.<br />In Hard Freeze - the second Kurtz novel - the ex-con/private eye has once again run afoul of the Buffalo mob.  Hit men are pursuing him as a bounty has been put on his life.  Meanwhile, Kurtz is also helping a man find the serial killer who murdered his daughter.  There are also subplots involving cops with a vendetta and the drunken stepfather of Kurtz's daughter.  While Simmons is good enough to tie all these strings together, he is not good enough to make this a great novel.  It is definitely good and easily merits a four star rating, but there are problems that prevent it from getting the full five stars  In particular, the serial killer is a weak character; as the main villain, he should be interesting, but he is so utterly routine that any habitual mystery reader will find absolutely nothing original about him.  There are also coincidences and implausibilities (such as the killer's ability to become a police captain) that are a bit irksome.<br />It is apparent that Simmons, a very good writer capable of writing quality novels, is writing these Kurtz novels as sort of a writing vacation.  They seem as if they are written quickly and without the sophisitication that most of his books have.  The end result is a fun, quick read that most will enjoy, but for Simmons's most dedicated fans, this will seem a bit beneath his abilities.	2003-12-05
US	43083835	R1LAQHGHDD51NG	0061015725	245555180	Prey	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Standard Crichton	In Michael Crichton's latest novel, Prey, the author revisits one of his oldest themes, in particular the dangers and unintended consequences of developing new technologies.  In this case, the technological development is nanotechnology and, as typical with Crichton, the effort is a mixed success.<br />The story in this case involves a company that has developed miniature robots for medical diagnostics.  Necessary to their success is a program that allows them to act as a swarm (since any individual robot is too small to perform complex tasks); this swarm eventually gets loose from the supposedly secure facility and starts multiplying and preying on the local animals.  The narrator is called in to try and rein in the nanobots, but they are evolving faster than he can come up with ways to stop them.<br />Crichton is an idea guy, and this story - like many of his novels - is dominated by the idea at the cost of other considerations such as plot or character.  In fact, most of the characters are little more than talking heads designed to represent various viewpoints (the voice of reason, the amoral entrepreneur, etc.) in the discussion of the dangers of this nanotechnology.  Despite a string of best-selling novels, the number of memorable Crichton characters can be counted easily on one hand, even if you lost a couple fingers in an accident.<br />This story is not completely original, revisiting elements from such books as Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain and Sphere.  In the end, however, this is standard Crichton:  fast reading and thought provoking without really being good writing.	2003-11-21
US	43083835	R39MA8JRZXX9YB	1571458271	468625276	Mythology: The Illustrated Anthology of World Myth and Storytelling	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Good overview of mythology	This massive coffee-table style book gives a good overview of some of the major mythologies in the world.  Overall, it has both good and bad points, with the good generally outweighing the bad.<br />The good points include the wide range of mythological stories that are related.  While Greek mythology - certainly the most well-known and influential in Western culture - gets more space than any other culture (over one hundred pages), there is plenty of space dedicated to the whole world of mythology: Egyptian, Babylonian, Norse, Chinese, Indian and Japanese amongst them.  A wide range of illustrations and photos help tell the stories.<br />Although wide-ranging, I think there are some noticeable gaps, both within specific sections (for example, no story of Eros and Psyche in the Greek myths) and significant types of myths that are neglected.  It would have been interesting to see a little about the Arthurian legends, which are a big part of British mythology.  The other thing that is missing is any sort of comparisons.  While many cultures had creation and flood stories, there is little direct commentary on the similarities or differences.  It would have also been interesting to see some discussion on parallels between myths and the stories of the Bible.<br />Of course, this book is big enough as it is, and editing decisions needed to be made.  While this book suffers from the flaw of incompleteness, it does not have flawed writing, which makes it a good book although (literally) not a light read.	2003-11-21

While rarely writing anything that could be considered \\"great,\\" he is at least consistent with turning out good work.  Unfortunately, at times, this consistency is also harmful; there is sometimes the sense that Koontz is always putting out the same book with just the names and plot device changing.<br />As is typical with a Koontz book, this story deals with a nice guy and a nice woman who are suddenly placed in a horrific situation and must pair up.  In this case, each is forcibly injected with an unknown substance by a mad scientist.  Complicating the situation are the shadowy (government?) forces chasing them and the guy's autistic brother who is brilliant in some ways but limits their mobility (many Koontz books have some sort of \\"special\\" person or in isolated cases, animals).  <br />This particular book deals with the dangers of nanotechnology; in this way, it is similar to Michael Crichton's Prey (which I read right after this book).  For Crichton, however, the ideas behind nanotechnology are the driving force in his book and are explained in great detail; here it is merely a plot gimmick to move the story along and is \\"explained\\" in a page or so.<br />Once again, this is a good, not great book, maybe three-and-a-half stars if such a rating was available.  New Koontz readers will not be overly disappointed, and for Koontz veterans, this one once again shows that he is nothing if not reliable.	2003-11-21
US	43083835	R67NI50IB5GRF	0380789019	511174865	Neverwhere	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Good standalone fantasy	For years, I've felt that one of the chief problems with the fantasy genre is the inability of most of its writers to compose a single volume story.  Driven more by commercial considerations than any true creative need, most authors compose trilogies or even longer series of novels.  In fact, the last standalone fantasy I had read by a major author was David Eddings's awful Redemption of Althalus.  With Neverwhere, Neil Gaiman has done what is nowadays most rare:  composed a single book fantasy novel which is also good.<br />The story is about Richard Mayhew, an average enough guy living in London who sees a young woman - Door - lying injured in the streets and is compelled to help her.  Proving that no good deed goes unpunished, the act of assisting her turns his own life to hell as suddenly he more-or-less disappears from existence.  In his world, he is now invisible; instead he has become part of Door's world, a strange and magical place that lies beneath the streets.<br />There is plenty of adventure that follows, with Richard as part of Door's quest to stop the killers of her family.  On the surface, Richard is a bit of a disappointment as a character, more of an observer than a doer, a man who reacts rather than acts.  On a deeper level, however, this is actually the story of Richard's self-discovery, and how he goes from being a generic everyman to forging his own identity.  <br />But don't let this depth intimidate you; this is essentially a fun fantasy novel with what readers of such books want:  weird plances, interesting characters, scary villains and lots of action.  It makes this book not only an outstanding book in a genre that has seen better days, but also a good book in its own rights.	2003-11-07
US	43083835	R3HHCF053UDVA7	0684859262	63597638	Single & Single	Books	3	9	14	N	N	So-so spy novel	It had been a long time (over fifteen years) since I had last read a John LeCarre novel when I picked up this novel out of a bargain bin.  Reading the story, I was reminded why I had gone so long without reading his books.  Single and Single is not really a bad novel, but it is not a very exciting one either.<br />The plot revolves around Oliver Single, son and partner of Tiger Single.  Tiger is a wheeler and a dealer with a limited sense of ethics.  Oliver's own ethics have caused him to betray his father to the law and go into hiding.  When Tiger's life is threatened, however, Oliver re-emerges into society and searches for his father.<br />For a story that deals with murder, betrayal and theft, there isn't all that much to excite.  The characters are well-written but bland and the structure of the story is more complicated than it needs to be.  I understand that LeCarre is supposed to be a master of the mundane spy story, but this is one tale that is a little too mundane and not masterful enough.  For better works in the same field, I would recommend Len Deighton; once again, LeCarre has failed to impress me and it may be a long time again before I read another of his books.	2003-11-07

While not a great novel by any stretch, this story is distinctly better than recent ones in the series.<br />Probably the reason for the improvement is that Stone is not as obsessed with bedding every woman he sees and instead is actually more interested in the actual mystery.  Unlike recent books, Stone is practically monogamous, which in itself is an interesting change-of-pace.  In fact, Stone comes off more human than usual and not always very likable, especially when he is practically ready to abandon a photographer who he has hired when his employee's mission goes awry.<br />If this book is better, it is not without its significant flaws.  Stuary Woods puts out over two books a year and his speedy writing pace often shows.  This is a book that is a fast read (I can't remember the last time it took me more than a day to read one of his books), but not a very deep one.  Certain plot points rely on contrived accidents, perhaps none more gratingly than when the whole story turns on an utterly minor character misplacing a fax.<br />In the end, this is a novel for Woods/Barrington fans only.  For those who find the story interesting at all, I think a better read along a similar line (main character versus a female assassin with whom he has a bond) is John Sandford's Certain Prey and Mortal Prey from his Lucas Davenport series.  Dirty Work is, on the other hand, a weak three star effort.	2003-11-03
US	43083835	R10URCE2LZ3SNR	0312989385	991869571	The Janson Directive	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Decent Ludlum	Robert Ludlum's latest thriller is par for the course - an amusing diversion that entertains while you read but is pretty forgettable after you're done.  Even now, a mere week after reading it, I find it hard to recall exactly what it was about.<br />Ah yes, now I remember:  An ex-spy named Janson is recruited to save the life of a philanthropic billionaire who is being held by a terrorist.  The rescue almost goes okay, but then goes really wrong and Janson is suddenly a fugitive.  Janson - like all Ludlum heroes, haunted by the death of a relative, in this case his wife - is caught between the government and the bad guys, and often has trouble figuring out which is which.<br />At first, this one seems like an atypical Ludlum novel.  The terrorist who Janson is up against seems strictly minor league and the global conspiracy that is standard Ludlum is nowhere to be seen.  Eventually, such a conspiracy does appear, but while it is a clever enough idea, the main villain - in certain ways obvious from the get-go - has achieved his power in a completely ludicrous way.  The sheer dumbness of the villain's rise to power - even though recognized as such by Janson - hurts the plausiblity and quality of the book.<br />But if this is not a great book, it is still the type of entertainment that Ludlum typically delivers.  For those familiar with Ludlum, there will be little disappointment here, and even for those unfamiliar with him, this will not be a bad read.  While I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this book, I wouldn't actively steer anyone away from it either.	2003-11-03
US	43083835	RBKX6KMSHEXMF	B00005VPRA	724495638	The covenant	Books	4	169	177	N	N	An epic historical novel	Sometimes it's nice to read a small book, a quick 150-300 page diversion from the real world.  At other times, however, it's nice to read a book with some real \\"meat\\" to it.  Few big name writers were more adept at producing these meaty books than James Michener, and in the Covenant, he presents one of his biggest, a 1200+ page epic about South Africa.<br />As usual, Michener is not as interested in adventure or characters as he is with relating the history of a particular region.  This is his formula:  to cover a region from prehistoric times to the present, watching it slowly get settled and eventually civilized, though this civilization is often with a great price. This is not to say that he doesn't write a compelling story:  he does, but he does not use heroes or villains to populate his world.  <br />This is a good book, but a reader new to Michener should learn to try and not get too attached to specific characters, as Michener treats them rather unsentimentally, and they often die in undramatic fashion.  Also, although there are some unpleasant people, Michener does not make them truly evil; he usually can show that these characters believe they have  justifiable reasons for their actions.  Writing as objectively as possible in a novel, he judges no one but rather allows the reader to make the judgements.<br />Many will be put off by the size of this book, but this is actually a reasonably fast read.  In the end, the reader will feel both entertained and educated, and that is perhaps the best that can be asked of from a novel.	2003-10-29

In The Policy, the characters deal with what could only be described as the insurance company from Hell.<br />The story focuses on Hunt Jackson, who has recently divorced and moved to his old hometown.  In some senses, things are going well:  he has reconnected with old friends, gotten a good job and found a new girlfriend.  On the other hand, he has to deal with an aggressive insurance agent who is constantly promoting additional insurances...and practically promising consequences if the insurance isn't purchased.  The types of insurance get more and more bizarre and the associated customer service is far more nightmarish than the typical computer automated maze.  But there is no escaping this nameless insurance agent and his offerings.<br />This is only the second Little book I've read, but it is entertaining enough to earn my highest compliment.  Not only am I giving it five stars, I've been inspired to buy more of his books.  For horror fans, this will not be a disappointment.	2003-10-29
US	43083835	R2I4CKHO75OWDY	0679722645	951875669	The Maltese Falcon	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	A True Classic	What makes a classic?  Perhaps that in itself is more of a discussion than is allowed in the Amazon word allotment, so I will limit myself to my personal definition:  a classic has to be (a) good, (b) a work that has withstood the test of time and (c) make a mark in its genre.  By this definition, the Maltese Falcon is a classic and I think few would disagree.<br />This is the story of Sam Spade, who is hired along with his partner Miles Archer, for what should be a routine tailing job.  When Archer winds up dead, followed shortly afterwards by his supposed killer, Spade himself winds up under intense police scrutiny, and that's only part of his problems.  He is also entangled with a series of criminals after the black bird of the title.<br />What makes the book special is Spade, the original tough-guy private eye.  Spade is not so much tough physically - although he can hold his own - but in attitude.  Spade's healthy belligerence towards the world is not the façade of a cowardly bully but rather a reflection of his strengths.  He handles his problems with a mix of stoicism and faint amusement and presents an air of amorality that may be more pretense than reality.  In brief, he is a well-developed character who moves the story along.<br />Hammett is not a perfect writer but this book is good enough and significant enough to rate an easy five stars.  Although it may seem tame or routine to modern readers, in the context of its time, this book was groundbreaking.  This is a classic of not only mysteries but also American literature.	2003-10-29

Pierce - recently out of a long-term relationship - has a new apartment and with it, a new phone number.  Unfortunately, this number is also listed on the web site of an escort service, and as a result, he is getting a lot of calls for a specific woman.<br />Pierce tries to track down this woman and soon gets enough clues to determine that she is missing and quite possibly in danger.  Although not physically nor mentally ready for such an effort, Pierce allows himself to get tangled in the mess that led to her disappearance, eventually getting suspected of her possible murder.<br />As is typical with Connelly books, this one is quite clever, nonetheless, it lacks the greatness of his Bosch books.  While good enough, the book is flawed by the weakness of the main character, whose self-destructive actions are sometimes beyond the comprehension of the reader.  Also, the story is neither as original or as daring as it could be. For example, one scene towards the end of the book (involving his ex-girlfriend) is reminscent of a similar scene in The Poet; and the promise of seeing the seamier side of life is never fully realized.  Few will be disappointed in this book except for the die-hard Connelly fans, who while enjoying this work, will know that he could have done even better.	2003-09-24

Although he has no truly classic stories, his body of work as both an author and editor has at least carved out a niche for him.  In Orion, he takes a bit of a break from his usual hard science fiction to pen a tale of the title character, divinely appointed to fight against an evil entity.<br />The premise to the book is intriguing enough, even if not completely original.  Taking pages from various mythologies, but focusing primarily on Zoroastrianism, Bova puts Orion at war with Ahriman, a Satanic figure intent on destroying humanity.  Ahriman has pinpointed certain key points in human history and tries to alter them to his benefit.  Orion is out to stop him.<br />The story is told episodically, with Orion being reborn in different eras but with memories of his past (actually his future, since he is moving back in time) and with the same exceptional physical abilities.  In every era, he also encounters a woman who he is in love with but whose true origins are a mystery to him (though not the reader).  <br />While interesting enough in theory, this novel is only okay in execution.  Bova's writing is not particularly good; while not bad either, it is rather flat and none of his characters are all that compelling.  Although he has a decent enough plot twist towards the end, it is not that difficult to figure it out, and his epilogue is really bad, as it cheapens the sacrifices that the hero has made.  This is not an awful book, but I know Bova is capable of better.  He may never be in the top tier of science fiction writers, but this is not even second-tier material.  It is mid-level quality, a basic three-star book.	2003-09-24
US	43083835	RG68V3273W9XI	0312890176	219764161	Shadow & Claw: The First Half of 'The Book of the New Sun'	Books	4	21	29	N	Y	Literary science fiction	Shadow and Claw is a combination of the first two volumes of Gene Wolfe's tetralogy The Book of the New Sun.  The individual books are Shadow of the Torturer and Claw of the Conciliator, and both follow (and are narrated by) Severian, an apprentice torturer on a far future Earth.<br />Severian is a young member of the Torturer's Guild, a respected (but also reviled) part of the government that implements punishments, sometimes through executions and sometimes through slower, more painful means.  The Guild members are not sadistic, but they are extremely bureaucratic, referring to their victims as clients and rigidly following the instructions of their higher-ups.  Although relatively content in this life, Severian breaks a cardinal rule by showing mercy to a prisoner.  This leads to his exile and a series of bizarre adventures that - as we are told quite early on - will lead to Severian's ascension to the throne of the Autarch.<br />In a vague sense, this is similar to Jack Vance's Dying Earth books, which also take place in an era when the sun is dying and Earth's civilization has become almost medieval again, with magic often replacing technology.  But where Vance focuses on humor and adventure, Wolfe has a loftier, more detached goal, aiming for a story that is more literature than genre fiction.  To some extent, he succeeds:  this is a very well-written tale, in the sense that he is adept at the use of language.  On the other hand, many readers may be distracted by his meandering plot and sometimes confusing action.<br />Although this series is considered somewhat of a classic, I'm not sure if I'd personally rate it that high.  It is not an easy read, and I feel my perspective may change if I reread it in the future; based on a single read, however, I'd say this is a good novel, bordering on great, but still a bit shy of true classic status.	2003-09-19

In it, we follow exiled torturer Severian on a series of adventures that (as the reader knows early on) will lead him to the position of Autarch, the king of his land.<br />As with the first half of this story, Wolfe is aiming for something more than a routine science fantasy novel, with general but not complete success.  The flaw is that in aiming for something more literary, Wolfe is also detaching himself from a lot of his potential audience.  The prose is sometimes a bit densely written and the action often seems to meander from the main story.  For example, it is not uncommon for there to be a break in the story by having some character tell a tale that is more or less unrelated to the main plot.<br />A good piece of literature often offers more upon multiple reads, and that is what this tetralogy aspires to be.  Is it successful?  Maybe, although after only one read, I was not completely satisfied.  As with the first volume, Shadow and Claw, this book is good to great, but not perfect.  While many will enjoy reading this book, they should be aware going in that this is not your typical fantasy novel.	2003-09-19

In The Crimson Petal and the White, Michel Faber has written an entertaining and fast-reading novel that brings what Charles Dickens was known for and updates it for a modern reader.  Like Dickens, Faber exposes the grimier side of Victorian England, but Faber goes further, permitted by modern sensibilities to explore issues that a 19th century Englishman could never get away with.<br />The story is essentially a couple years in the lives of two characters:  Sugar, a self-educated and ambitious prostitute, and William Rackham, son of a perfume magnate who is living beyond his means.  The first liaison between the two has William aspiring to greater things, if only to afford exclusive access to Sugar.  For William, this means a rise to great success as he at long last is worthy of his father's company.  For Sugar, this is an opportunity to rise from prostitute to mistress.  Mixed into their intricate relationship are a number of characters, particularly related to William:  his ailing and emotionally immature wife, his isolated daughter and his ultra-religious brother, to name a few.<br />The back-of-the-book summary is a bit deceptive here, implying that this is a story of Sugar using a lot of men on her way to prosperity; actually, William is really the only man she is with in the novel, and he is nearly as much the main character as Sugar is.  There is also a narrative style that is a bit off-beat, especially at the beginning, with the narrator speaking directly to the reader as a sort of tour guide.<br />If Dickens wrote in part to expose the social ills of Victorian England, Faber writes to expose the hypocrisy of the era, where nearly every character is damaged by the demands for extreme sexual repression.  While some may argue that we are too sexually explicit nowadays (and might even point to this book as an example), Faber shows that the reverse situation was pretty bad in itself.  But even without taking possible thematic content into consideration, there is still plenty of good stuff here:  this is a fun book and well-worth reading.	2003-09-19
US	43083835	R2O0PS4UAHLCPV	0451209443	786063504	Sphere of Influence	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Entertaining if Somewhat Standard	In Sphere of Influence, Kyle Mills brings back series character Mark Beamon, brilliant FBI agent whose life is filled with bad luck and his own socially inept decisions.  In this latest effort, he once again is threatened with losing his job, going to jail and possibly getting killed as he gets involved with tracking down a rocket launcher being held by terrorists.<br />At the beginning of the novel, Beamon is facing a bad job review and increasing hostility from his superiors.  In addition, his on-again-off-again relationship with this girlfriend continues to be fragile.  When terrorists threaten to launch rockets at American targets, Beamon is called in, not so much because he's brilliant but because he has a connection that can force the CIA to cooperate with the FBI investigation.  Since the CIA agent called in is intimately involved with the terrorists -  as well as organized crime - he is not particularly cooperative.  <br />In what initially seems to be a separate investigation, Beamon is then called into an undercover role as a mercenary named Nikolai.  This supposedly brief assignment winds up being a dangerous mess and Beamon is forced much more deeply into his assignment.  He gets involved with Christian Volkov, a major organized crime boss, and in the process, gets tangled up in illegal operations.<br />Mills has put together a good novel, but not one that is distinct from a dozen similar stories.  While striving towards realistic situations, Mills simultaneously creates characters and scenarios that are borderline implausible.  Overall, while this book is by no means a classic, it is at least entertaining and a fun way to spend a few hours.	2003-09-19
US	43083835	R2E7IYE89EWX2S	0425191184	17508097	Red Rabbit (Tom Clancy)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Seriously flawed	There's not much good to say about Tom Clancy's latest paperback, Red Rabbit, a truly tepid thriller in which Clancy exhibits barely enough skill to merit two stars.  <br />At first, the story is reminiscent of The Day of the Jackal (a far superior book).  In 1982, the USSR plots the assassination of Pope John Paul II.  As in TDOTJ, which involved a plot to kill DeGaulle, the reader knows that the plot has to fail, but there should still be suspense; in Red Rabbit, there isn't.  A KGB agent learns of the plot and contacts the CIA to warn of the scheme and defect in the process.  The assassination plot suddenly almost disappears as this \\"Red Rabbit's\\" defection is plotted out.<br />The flaws in this book are so considerable - and so obvious - that one has to wonder what could motivate Clancy to put out this sort of lousy writing.  For one thing, Clancy - a writer whose success is built on his ability to present interesting facts correctly, hasn't got even his basic history correct.  Does the story take place in 1981 (when the actual attempt took place), 1982 (hinted at by the code number of the plot and the real death year of minor character Suslov) or 1983 (the actual year the Phillies and Orioles meet in the World Series, a minor story point that Orioles owner Clancy should be well aware of)?<br />In this supposedly historical novel, Clancy is able to make his characters seem brilliant, anticpating everything from the success of Starbucks to the fall of the Soviet Union.  As usual, his characters are rather shallow and his pro-American standpoint is bordering on the jingoistic...I'm fond enough of this country, but Clancy sometimes goes overboard.<br />Yet all this could be forgivable if the story was in any way really interesting.  The story is almost actionless, with even the eventual assassination attempt taking place almost in the background.  Most of the book is just dialogue and thought.  Worst of all, the crux of the book - the attempt to get the defector and his family out of the USSR - proceeds so smoothly and without a single twist that it winds up being a worthless three hundred or so pages of the novel.<br />Clancy will never be confused with a great writer at the best of times, but he is usually entertaining.  This book is hopefully just an aberration; I'd hate to think this means his talent has all burned away.  This one is for true Clancy fans only, and even they will be disappointed and long for better days.	2003-08-22

(Myth) (Myth-Adventures)	Books	3	13	17	N	Y	Another MYTH-step by Asprin	Robert Asprin, an erratic writer as far as his output is concerned, finally returned after around a decade or so to his Myth series last year with Myth-ion Improbable, a weak and humorless effort that was far inferior to his other efforts.  With Something MYTH Inc., he has improved slightly but the title is more than a pun; there is indeed something missing still.<br />In what is likely to be the last of the series, Asprin wraps up storylines with all the delicacy of a sledgehammer.  Actually, most of the story deals with minor character Guido and his attempts to put down rebellions by such feeble threats as Robb the Hood and his Married Men.  These characters are such non-threats that there is little suspense in the whole story.<br />Towards the end of the book, the focus is finally back on Skeeve, who makes decisions about his future that affects everyone.  Also, the loose ends are tied together quickly, almost too quickly for those who have waited years for resolutions.  All this in a very quick 150+ pages plus a throwaway short story and character guide.<br />While this is not an awful book, it is also not very good, certainly not a very rewarding finish for those who have enjoyed this series.  But if the last two books are any indication, it is probably best that the series has concluded; there will be no more disappointments in the future.	2003-08-22

This book is somewhat like a flat soda; the flavor is there, but there's something critical missing that limits your enjoyment.<br />In the book's case, the problem is the characters.  Bearden shows that he is decent with description and with plotting, but his characters are insubstantial and never really evoke any feelings.  The story also hinges on a major coincidence involving the relationship between two of the protagonists...indeed, even Bearden occasionally seems uncomfortable with this coincidence.<br />This is not a bad book.  This is not a good book.  While Bearden appears to have the beginnings of being a good writer, he is not there yet; perhaps he is better with non-fiction, but in fiction, he still has work to do.	2003-08-09

He's still too recent a president to get a truly objective biography; most writers would either have an agenda to push or be interested in a sensationalistic angle (try and find a Bush or Clinton biography that does not have a distinct slant).  When I saw that Robert Dallek had come out with a JFK biography, my knowledge of his interest in historical writing overcame my skepticism and I was rewarded for taking the chance.<br />Although slightly favorable to JFK, this is overall a very balanced book.  Dallek does not ignore Kennedy's obvious flaws and shows that JFK was not one of the great presidents, but merely a good one, elevated to higher prominence through his charisma and his assassination.<br />Dallek deals with JFK's philandering but does not dwell on it more than necessary.  What he is more interested in is JFK's medical history, which was largely concealed from the public.  It is a comment on JFK's willpower that he was able to not be beaten by his poor health; in this sense, he was similar to an earlier Democrat, Andrew Jackson, who was also in constant battle with pain and health issues.<br />JFK is also portrayed as a rather moderate figure, hardly ideological or willing to fight all out for important issues such as civil rights.  Instead, he was often deceitful or flaky in his actions.  However, when it was the most important, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK was at his best and resisted pressures that might have had other presidents starting nuclear wars.  JFK was also a very sharp person, witty and clever and able to charm both men and women.<br />Of course, objective and detailed writing is nothing if it is not good and readable as well, and this book is.  There have been many books on JFK and his family, and it is too soon to say there is a single &quot;definitive&quot; biography (such as Remini on Andrew Jackson or Dumas Malone on Jefferson), but this book is well-written enoughthat it might someday be considered for that honor.	2003-07-30

I have also had a fascination with the Arthurian tales.  I should have found a combination of Steinbeck and King Arthur to be great; instead, I found only a passably good book (a little over three-and-a-half stars).<br />As is obvious from the letters Steinbeck wrote on the subject, he had a fascination with King Arthur too.  The book he wrote is largely a translation of older works, especially Malory.  While entertaining enough, it suffers from two principal flaws:  it is an incomplete work (the book was published posthumously) and it is not what Steinbeck does best.<br />This book is best for Steinbeck (or Camelot) completists only.  For those who want a proper introduction to either the author or this subject, there is plenty of better places to start.	2003-07-21

What I got was what I really wanted: a well-written history of the Jews from ancient times to today.<br />Two things make this book great.  First, Dimont is a good writer, both insightful and entertaining, with occasional flashes of ironic humor.  Second, Dimont puts the history of the Jews in the larger context of World History and keeps from a narrower Jewish perspective.<br />On the one hand, Dimont does not hide his general admiration for the Jews, both for their endurance and their contributions to society that are far out of proportion to their percentage of the populace.  On the other hand, for those who believe that Jews have suffered nothing but persecution for thousands of years, Dimont presents a different viewpoint which shows Jews often prospering.  <br />No one will find Dimont fully objective in his history, but they should find that he presents an overall balanced work.  Written with both Jewish and non-Jewish audiences in mind, Dimont has put together a wonderful book that is good for both those interested in Jewish history or those interested in Western history in general.	2003-07-21

It is three-and-a-half star material all the way.<br />In this story, Holly Barker, police chief for Orchid Beach, becomes embroiled in a real estate scheme that has murders attached to it.  Befriending a developer who is almost killed himself, Holly gets involved from the inside as well as in her cop role.  What follows is the sort of quick paced action one expects out of one of Woods's books.<br />As entertaining as the book is, it's also far from perfect.  Any veteran mystery reader will have the villain pegged pretty quickly and there are other bits of silliness.  For example, I doubt most people would think that &quot;Blood Orchid&quot; would be a good name for a housing development.<br />On the other hand, Holly is much more interesting than Woods's principal series character, Stuart Barrington, although not as developed as Will Lee.  For a fun quick read, this book fits the bill, but in the grand pool of mysteries, this book is definitely on the shallow end.	2003-07-14

I figure that 95% of the readers of this book will think &quot;We're really getting used.&quot;  The remaining 5% - the wealthiest 5% of Americans - will no doubt think &quot;We've got it made!&quot;  In short, Phillips thoroughly documents the ways that the wealthiest interests in this country pretty much get all they want, often at the expense of the rest of us.<br />Despite the subtitle of the book, this book is really only nominally a history.  After the first couple of chapters, history takes a back seat as Phillips gets more involved with economics and political science.  The book's organization is a limited success and there is more than a little redundancy.  In addition, the book's principal ideas have a certain hopelessness about them as he puts forth the problem and poses no real solution (other than to ride out things until we get to a more progressive era).  To have this same message repeated over and over again from different angles makes this a downbeat book.<br />Phillips does deserve credit for presenting a good case, backed by a lot of supporting evidence and even if his organization isn't the greatest, he can write well in his limits.  And despite the depresssing nature of his book, it is information that needs to get out.	2003-07-14

Peter, who is both a veteran cop and a devout Jew, acts as a liaison between the tight-knit Jewish community to which his family belongs and the NYPD.  Doing his own investigation, he gets reinvolved with Chris Donatti, a manipulative killer with whom he shares a strange bond.<br />The mystery in this book is relatively routine, but Kellerman does a good job at making it interesting.  And the family drama which often dominates her stories takes a bit of a back seat this time.  Instead, the best parts of the story involve the interaction between the Deckers and Donatti.<br />Except for some rather jarring moments later in the book when she switches to first person point-of-view, this is another good crime story from Kellerman, who has proven to be consistently good over the past few years (although I was not pleased with her non-Decker story, Moon Music).  I also have my usual gripe that these stories should not be called \\"Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus\\" novels as Rina has had the Decker surname for over a decade in both real and book time; I suppose that is more the publisher than the author, however.  <br />If you're a Faye Kellerman fan, you should enjoy this latest novel.  If not, however, this is not the place to start as it refers a lot to older books.	2003-07-14

Brookhiser gives us the opportunity to learn about this man and his role in early U.S. history.<br />Morris was generally a peripheral character in the Revolutionary Era, but he did play a significant role in the drafting of the Constitution.  His writing skills put the Constitution into its essentially final form, and the Preamble is almost entirely his creation.  Beyond this, however, he was a more minor political player.<br />A lot of this was by Morris's own choice, since he wasn't all that interested in higher office.  He was an interesting enough person, in many ways more human than the semi-immortals with whom he worked with.  Relatively easy-going and with a good sense of humor, Morris was also - despite a maimed hand and a missing leg - quite the ladies' man, even having an affair with one French woman who was not only married, but already the mistress to another.  When he finally married late in life, he successfully avoided social pressure by choosing a wife with a bit of a reputation.<br />Brookhiser - a rather politically conservative writer - has a lot of sympathy for the Federalists such as Hamilton and Morris.  He, nonetheless, has written a good, objective book, the best of the three of his I read (the other two were on Hamilton and the Adams family).  While Morris is rightly accorded a lesser light in history, he does deserve some illumination and Brookhiser's book does the job well.	2003-06-30

While more entertaining and better organized than the similarly-themed book Salt by Mark Kurlansky, Gately's knowledge of history beyond that of tobacco is sometimes deficient and he often comes off as an apologist for the tobacco industry.<br />Gately starts at the beginning, with the Indians who discovered tobacco and consumed it in a number of fashions.  When Europeans were introduced, they quickly became addicted and tobacco became one of the most valuable crops around.  Although Gately goes all the way to the present day and the decline of tobacco (at least in the U.S.), and he does discuss some of the health problems related to smoking, there is a sense he is downplaying the dangers of the substance and the industry's complicity in avoiding reform.<br />Despite his biases, Gately does present most of the facts and even if you don't agree with his views, he is still a good writer and he covers this topic with a brisk and often humorous style.  This is a good read for those interested in history from the point-of-view of a substance instead a person or a nation.	2003-06-30

This is one of those, a warning of the dangers of scientific ignorance.<br />We've heard it before, regarding evolution, global warming, the dangers of smoking: &quot;It's just a theory.&quot;  As if to dismiss massive amounts of scientific evidence because of a limited amount of uncertainty is okay, or to allow crackpota who think that smoking is harmless equal time although their arguments are utterly flaky.  Here is a book that shows that such arguments are both wrong and destructive.<br />Pollack focuses on global warming, which is a good illustrative example of how the uncertainties of science are manipulated (and a subject that fits into his geological background).  He shows that few things in science are dead certain and that there are levels of uncertainty.  It may be impossible to show a 100% certain link between global warming and fossil fuels, but that doesn't mean the idea should be dismissed casually.  Pollack points out that most of the people who exploit the uncertainty have a vested interest in the status quo.<br />There is blame aplenty to be spread, but Pollack seems to point the finger most strongly at the public which is in general scientifically ignorant enough to buy these specious arguments.  Other entities such as the media and politicians are hardly guilt-free either, nor is the scientific community which often makes itself inaccessible to the public.<br />Pollack is a good writer.  The main flaw in the book is you're never fully certain what it wants to be.  A book about scientific uncertainty that uses global warming as its prime example or a book about the risks of global warming that discusses the exploitation of &quot;uncertain science&quot; in showing why these risks continue.  Either way, this book - which would normally be a four star book - gets a bonus star because its message is too important to ignore, whichever of the two it may be.	2003-06-14

While not up to the caliber of those later works, it certainly has its merits.<br />Mysteries of Pittsburgh is the story of Art Bechstein and the summer after his college graduation.  His distant and domineering father is a mob accountant who is unsatisfied with his son's direction in life; the summer of the story will add no new closeness between the two.  Art spends the time partying and being seduced by his friend Arthur and a girl named Phlox; Art's own self-doubts push him in one direction, then another.  Meanwhile, another friend, the wild-living Cleveland, is interested in a life of crime and sees Art and his family connections as a path in the right direction.<br />The novel itself is essentially plotless, just a summer-in-the-life tale.  While not great, it is entertaining in places and is a worthwhile read for Chabon fans.  Others may enjoy this book, but it is mostly of interest for those who want to see what Chabon wrote before he hit it big.	2003-06-11

Certainly our french fries would be blander, but actually salt has had a critical role in our history as Kurlansky describes in this uneven but generally good book.<br />In a roundabout way, we are taken from ancient times to the present and throughout the world to see how salt has had an impact on our civilization.  At one time so valuable that people were paid with it (from which we get the salt-based word salary), salt was essential for preserving food in an era before refrigeration.  It was a cause of wars and a factor in victory and defeat.<br />The book's biggest flaw is that it is not well-organized.  Although generally moving from past to present, Kurlansky skips back and forth in time and place in a somewhat aggravating manner.  In a non-fiction work, the reader should have a better sense of direction.  In addition, at times Kurlansky overstates the importance of salt: certainly, salt helped dictate where cities would be located, but it is not the dominant factor he makes it out to be; other items such as water and wood also played a role.<br />Overall, however, this is a decently written and informative book, an off-beat way to look at history.  Even if it meanders a little too much, it does eventually get to its destination and you will be educated and entertained in the process.	2003-06-11

It is an intriguing presentation of theories about the Grail and various religious conspiracies, but fans of the suspense genre may sense a certain been-there-done-that feel to the book.<br />The story begins with Robert Langdon, a professor specializing in religious symbols, being called to the scene of a strange murder at the Louvre.  The victim has conveniently taken long enough to die to leave a riddle behind, a riddle intended to team up Langdon with the victim's granddaughter, Sophie, and send them off on a quest for the Grail.  They set off on this quest, pursued by the police (who think Langdon is the killer),  a mysterious figure called the Teacher, and a giant albino monk who is hired muscle (all these types of novels have some freakish killer) and part of an extreme sect within the Catholic Church.<br />Apart from some interesting theories about the Church and the Grail and various pieces of art (such as the Mona Lisa), this novel doesn't offer much, but Brown does write well enough to keep things reasonably exciting.  Though the story requires a lot of exposition, Brown does a good job of parceling it out in small doses mixed in with the action.<br />Although the theories in the story sometimes cross the line into implausibility, Brown does put together some rather intriguing concepts.  This is far from a perfect novel, and far from an original one, but it is a fun one.	2003-05-31

Some figures with virtually no political experience became good Presidents, such as Washington and Lincoln; others were failures such as Grant or Hoover.  On the other hand, political experience is no guarantee of success: John Quincy Adams and James Buchanan had decent resumes going into office and had miserable presidencies.  Martin Van Buren, one of the most politically talented of all Presidents, was not an utter failure, but he didn't shine in office either.<br />In Niven's biography, we follow Van Buren from his impoverished roots through his rise in New York state government.  Although not perfect, Van Buren had enough political astuteness and the right sort of temperment to help create and lead a party machine and elevate New York's prominence on a national level.  Becoming a trusted advisor to Andrew Jackson and a member of his cabinet eventually led to his Vice Presidency and then the Presidency.  With a major financial crash occurring right as he got into office, Van Buren was struggling right off the bat, and wound up serving only a single term; nonetheless, in an era of one-term presidents (from 1837 to 1861, no president was re-elected), Van Buren was hardly thrown into ignonimy after his defeat; instead, he remained a powerful member of the Democratic party for the next two decades.<br />Niven's biography is generally favorable although he doesn't hide Van Buren's flaws.  We learn of a man who was not a great ideologue but was one of the most masterful politicians of his era, holding his own with the often more prominent figures such as Jackson, Calhoun, Clay and Webster.  He also wound up being a prominent figure in the anti-slavery movement, even running on the Free-Soil ticket at one point.  <br />At times, however, this biography is a bit ponderous and often focuses so much on the political part of Van Buren's life that the personal part is pushed aside.  Thus, although this may be the best Van Buren biography available (it may also be the only one), I cannot give it a full five stars.  Nonetheless, this is overall a very good book and worth reading if you are interested in this period of history.	2003-05-31

It is only in the loosest sense a sequel, with only a couple minor characters from the first book returning.  Instead, it is another successful Russo exploration of the themes that run throughout his books: the dying of the small town and the relationship between fathers and sons.<br />More particularly, Russo explores the damage wayward fathers cause.  In this case, Sam Hall abandons his son Ned shortly after birth and returns only haphazardly to create additional messes.  Sam is a deadbeat dad, a drunkard and a philanderer and interestingly, one of the better fathers depicted in a Russo story:  when the going gets tough, Sam does at least somewhat come through for his son.<br />The town of Mohawk is not a pleasant place; while many are happy within, it is a trap, one which Sam and his estranged wife, Jenny, cannot escape.  Whether Ned can overcome the snares of his parents and his home is one of the questions that are at least partially answered within.<br />If I am not really getting into plot here, it is because there really isn't much of one; this book is more or less Ned Hall's memoir, the tale of his childhood and young adulthood. As always, Russo delivers with great writing, a blend of the humorous and the serious, and if this doesn't quite rate five stars - he has even better books such as Nobody's Fool and Empire Falls - it is a strong four star book and well worth reading.	2003-05-27

While not the best in the bunch, it is still good enough to satisfy any Sandford fan.<br />A follow-up novel to Certain Prey - a couple books back in the series - Mortal Prey has the return of top-notch assassin Clara Rinker.  She escaped at the end of Certain Prey, but when her lover is killed and she sustains a wound that kills her unborn baby, Clara is drawn out of hiding to avenge the murders.  Lucas, hearing that Clara is back in the U.S., is called in to assist in her detention.<br />Clara is a challenging contrast to the normal serial killers that Lucas contends with, principally because she is not truly insane and is not driven by some psychosis that forces her to kill.  Instead, she is coldly calculating and not likely to make the errors in judgment that often do in other Davenport adversaries.<br />There are no real flaws in this book except that Lucas himself is a little less interesting than usual.  The Prey books are at their best when he is at his edgiest, and he is a bit tamer in this novel.  Nonetheless, this is a good book and even a person new to the series should catch on pretty quickly and enjoy the ride.	2003-05-18
US	43083835	R10X5HRLSSKUWW	0446611913	265598858	Up Country	Books	5	3	6	N	N	Another DeMille epic	In Up Country, Nelson DeMille brings back Paul Brenner, his hero from The General's Daughter.  Although the two books were written roughly a decade apart, this sequel takes place less than a year later.<br />Although Brenner has been forced into retirement, he is recruited by his old boss to investigate a murder that took place thirty years ago in Vietnam.  There isn't much evidence, but there is one possible witness, who if still alive, is somewhere deep in Vietnam.  Brenner is canny enough to know he is not getting the full story, but he proceeds anyways.  In Vietnam, he teams up with the mysterious and beautiful Susan Weber and they are off on their adventures.<br />Although this is nominally a mystery story, it actually is a tale of Brenner and his revisiting with the old demons of war.  For most of the first six hundred pages or so, this murder mystery takes a back seat to Brenner's rediscovery of a country that he last visited under much different circumstances.  And even though there is now peace, there is still a lot of danger, and not just from the Vietnamese.  While Paul remains the same smart aleck as always, we can tell it's not so much because of an inherent obnoxiousness but rather as a defense mechanism.<br />Although the mystery takes a while to truly kick in, when it does it is pretty good, as is Brenner's own quest for personal peace.  In a way, this is the Odyssey in reverse; the hero starts at home and is driven further and further away.  Even if you have not read the General's Daughter, this is a great book, suspenseful, insightful and a sometimes harrowing look at Vietnam both during the war and in the present.	2003-05-18

While this book does offer some minor insights, it is flawed in a number of ways.<br />First of all, thematically, this book is weak.  While John Adams and John Quincy Adams are important figures in history, Charles and Henry are really much more footnotes.  Nonetheless, Brookhiser gives each figure equal weight, while it is clear that - like most dynasties - the glory rarely lasts beyond the second generation.  And with all the discussion he gives to the later Adamses, he only peripherally discusses John's important cousin, Samuel Adams.   <br />Not as glaring but more problematic is Brookhiser's occasional distortion of history and his imperfect objectivity.  A couple examples:  he refers to James Buchanan as a definite homosexual, while the evidence is far from clear on that subject.  He also incorrectly states the chronology of the 1824 election:  John Quincy Adams did not offer Clay the Secretary of State position until after he was elected.<br />At best, this book is half good, primarily as an introduction to John and John Quincy, both of whom have much better biographies available.  Otherwise, this book is skippable.	2003-05-18

Vampires and werewolves wander the countryside, dodos are popular pets and the line between literature and reality is very thin:  people can enter and leave novels and sometimes affect the reality within.  Thursday Next, literary detective and hero of previous novel, The Eyre Affair, is once again entangled in a mess that threatens her whole reality.<br />The malevolent Goliath Corporation wants their vicious executive, Jack Schitt returned to the real world; he's been trapped in Poe's The Raven and only Thursday can get him out.  As a form of coercion, they have eradicated her husband; by wiping him out of reality, only she (and a couple Goliath folks) remember him.  Entering books isn't easy, however; in the previous volume there was a machine, but that is no longer available.  Coming up with an alternative, while meanwhile avoiding a villain who can reverse entropy and cause coincidences, facing an awareness that the world is likely to soon end mysteriously and coping with the early stages of pregnancy (by a now non-existent husband) are among the challenges Thursday must deal with.<br />Despite the many witty things within this book, this is not a comic novel; the world is far too grim for a comic world.  If the book is a little too muddled and a little too reliant on deus ex machinas to rate five stars, it is still strong enough to be very good.  Fans of The Eyre Affair will be pleased; others are cautioned to read that book first to properly enjoy this one; it may stand alone well, but it works better as a sequel.	2003-05-10

Not quite as violent as Parker, not quite as comic as Dortmunder, Meehan is recruited by some true low-lifes: politicians.<br />Having learned from the mistakes of Watergate, the President's men have hired a competent crook who they can tantalize into work with the possibility of freedom.  Both sides are in over their heads:  Meehan is used to a more honest breed of crook, and the politicos have little idea what the world of crime is like.<br />Like other Westlake caper novels, half the fun is in the preparation of the eventual crime.  Most of this book deals with the preparations, with the actual crime not taking place till late in the book.  Westlake is a master in this field, and he doesn't disappoint here.  If the book rates four stars, it is only because, good as it is, it is not quite the level of some of his other works.  Nonetheless, neither Westlake veterans nor first-time readers should be anything less than pleasantly entertained.	2003-05-10

After all, it featured short stories from some really great writers, and the emphasis was going to be on adventure.  I really wanted to like it, and found it disappointing that the book was only entertaining in spots.<br />The goal of the book, as Chabon states in the introduction, is to have an anthology of short stories in a more &quot;classic&quot; vein:  the sort of stories that were published in decades past, filled with fun and mystery as opposed to the more literary, plotless, &quot;moment-of-truth&quot; stories of today.  Unfortunately, this book did not make me long for yesteryear, but instead made me think that the passing of short genre fiction was not necessarily a bad thing.<br />The biggest flaw in the book is that the authors - almost all excellent at long fiction, seem to be unable to write a truly good short story.  A couple stories, such as &quot;The General&quot; and &quot;The Albertine Notes&quot; are borderline unreadable.  Most of the others are just so-so.  Even Stephen King - who has shown over the years that he is adept in short fiction as well as novels - has contributed an only mildly okay story which is probably only best enjoyed by his Dark Tower fans.  And Harlan Ellison - a master of the short story and an author who I really enjoy - is also a disappointment here, with a story which comes more as a Harlan Ellison parody than the real thing.<br />There are one or two gems in the bunch (but not much more).  Nick Hornby and Elmore Leonard have written a couple good stories, but that's around it.  Ironically, some of the stories seem to consist of the very material that Chabon is trying to avoid:  for example, one story is nothing more than a character study of a woman climbing a mountain; there is no adventure or real conflict in the tale; it may be good writing, but it does not fit with the themes of the anthology.<br />Most people will buy this book because they enjoy one or more of the authors featured within.  My recommendation is to read the authors you like and approach the others at your own risk.	2003-05-05

It is quite a challenge; even determining the child's identity isn't easy.  In the course of the investigation, Bosch also meets a rookie cop who he becomes romantically entangled with; as with everything in Bosch's life, there will be big complications here too.<br />Connelly once again shows that he is one of the best mystery writers around today, probably in the top five on the active list.  And Connelly is never stronger than when he writes about Bosch.  It is not essential that you read the previous Bosch books to enjoy this one,...	2003-04-28

Although his family connections didn't hurt, they also weren't overly helpful;  his break from his father's Federalist connections means that JQA had to attain the nation's highest office based primarily on his own resume, not his father's.  <br />Ironically, Adam's tenure as President was in some ways, the low point in his career of public service.  Prior to then, he was one of the best foreign relations people in American history, one of the primary authors of the Treaty of Ghent and the Monroe Doctrine.  In his post-Presidential life, he was a prominent Congressman noted for his anti-slavery work (including his winning defense in the Amistad case) and his part in founding the Smithsonian Institute.  As a President, however, he was at best mediocre and ineffective, his four years marred from the start by his controversial election and his unwise appointment of Henry Clay as Secretary of State (for Clay, it was equally unwise to have accepted the position).<br />Having read Remini's three volume biography of Jackson, it was interesting to read his depiction of one of Jackson's principal political enemies.  Remini does a good job, but this is not as strong an effort as his other biographical works.  The brevity of the book (which I believe was imposed by the American Presidents Series editors) makes this book more of an overview than a full biography.  Remini does cover most of the major points, however, and does deal with Adams's personal life as well.<br />As stated before, John Quincy Adams was not a very significant President, but he is an important part of early U.S. history.  This book is a good introduction to the man often recognized as the best Secretary of State ever.  For a more detailed biography, however, Paul Nagel's recent work is a worthwhile read.	2003-04-28

His stories may not be deep but they are always fun.<br />In this collection, Vance shows he is as adept with short stories as he is with novels.  The first story deals with space travel cadets on a mission with their ofttimes cruel instructor.  The second story is a humorous story of one man taking on a vast government bureaucracy; this is followed by a tale of an overpopulated Earth where a hundred square feet may be a vast estate and a man who acquires a whole alien continent on which to live.  The final tale deals with aquatic miners contending with a dangerous sea creature.<br />All four stories are typical Vance, which is to say, great stuff.  If you have the opportunity to pick this one up somewhere, you will have a nice treat.	2003-04-21

With The God of Old, Kugel once again takes up to pre-Christian times and gives us new insight as to the meanings of certain items in Bible.<br />In this brief book, Kugel has assembled what is essentially a collection of a half dozen essays around a common theme: how did the people in Old Testament times actually view God.  Dealing with topics such as divine justice, the nature of angels and the existence of the afterlife, he shows that God was an evolving figure in history and the ancient concept is often quite different from the modern one.<br />Kugel has written a clear, thoughtful work with the occasional bits of humor.  Sometimes - as he himself admits - his interpretations may be stretches, but they are all thought-provoking.  As any book dealing with religion, this book will definitely have its detractors; nonetheless, if you are open to new ways of viewing an old book, this will be a good read.	2003-04-21

Anyone familiar with the genre has probably seen it all, which makes the challenge greater for the really good authors.  Fortunately, Robert Ferrigno lives up to the challenge with Flinch.<br />Jimmy Gage is a top-notch tabloid reporter back in town after a year abroad.  Before he left, he received a letter from the Eggman, who purported to be a serial killer.  After investigation, it appears the Eggman is only a hoax, and by the time of Jimmy's return, the crimes remain unsolved.  By accident, however, Jimmy stumbles upon evidence that the Eggman might be his brother, a sibling he has had a rather strained relationship over the years (not made any better since the brother married Jimmy's ex-girlfriend).<br />This might make for a rather routine novel, but at times, the Eggman story is merely incidental as Jimmy copes with the other  characters in his life including a loan shark, her dim-witted bodyguard, a crippled but still deadly fence/drug-dealer and his lethal assistant.  Like an Elmore Leonard novel, the characters and how they interact is as important as the plot.  And also like Leonard, there is a dark humor that amuses but does not diminish the suspense.<br />If Ferrigno has a fault as a writer, it is only that he sometimes takes a while to produce a new novel.  Other than that, Ferrigno is consistenly great, and this book continues his string of quality work.	2003-04-21

Of course, it's not the sort of string that you could buy at the hardware store, but it is the basis for a developing theory of &quot;everything.&quot;<br />The Elegant Universe is a great book but not always an easy book to read.  This is through no fault of Greene - an adept writer who is also a scientist making contributions to string theory - but the result of the heady material that is being discussed.  When dealing with areas of science where the &quot;normal&quot; rules don't apply (such as black holes or the Big Bang) or discussing eleven dimensional space, we are dealing with concepts beyond what we see in our everyday lives and are often hard to picture.<br />Even after two readings of this book, there is still a lot that I don't fully grasp and know there is another reading of this book sometime in my future.  Although Greene is writing for the layperson, he is writing for an educated one; this is not the book to start with if you are unfamiliar with science but find the subject intriguing.  You're better off with Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time or Universe in a Nutshell.  Timothy Ferris's The Whole Shebang is a bit more detailed, but not quite as complex as Greene's book.<br />So even if you find this a difficult book, it is nonetheless a great one and worth your time if you are interested in the subject.	2003-04-19

There may be others, and they may even be good (I haven't yet read them), but this book represents Herbert's final words on the subject.  Although not perfect, and definitely leaving things open for another book, this is, overall, a worthy addition to the series.<br />In this book - a direct sequel to Heretics of Dune with many of the same characters - the Bene Gesserit sisterhood is under siege, threatened by the Honored Matres, a somewhat darker version of their own organization, that is sweeping viciously across the galaxy like a barbarian horde.  With the original Dune lifeless after a Matres attack, the Bene Gesserit are trying to create a similar world out of their headquarters.  Although they don't think of it in those terms, they are really trying to create a planetary ghola, a clone similar to that of recurring character Duncan Idaho.  The book focuses on the war between the two sisterhoods.<br />The book does have its flaws.  The rather open-ended conclusion may be forgiven if we believe that Herbert had another book intended.  The characters are, as usual, overly serious and everything they do is filled with hidden meanings.  Also, there is a feeling that Herbert was making up parts of this story as he goes along, with new movements suddenly appearing (such as the futuristic Jews who have never been previously mentioned although they have supposedly always been around).<br />In the end, what is the central point or character of this series?  Is it a history of the Bene Gesserit, the House Atreides, Duncan Idaho or some combination of all these.  My feeling that the center of this saga is the Tyrant Leto, with the first trilogy (Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune) a story of his origin, the central book (God Emperor) the tale of his emperorship, and the final trilogy (Heretics, Chapterhouse and an intended final book) to be the story ofLeto's Golden Path.  <br />That is my theory.  Whatever your own ideas, if you have enjoyed the previous books, you should enjoy this one also and when you conclude it, you will have read one of the most significant series in science fiction.	2003-04-16

The book jacket wasn't very helpful, mentioning only a boy, a tiger and the vast Pacific Ocean.  It almost hints at a light tale of adventure, but like the ocean, it is deeper than it seems at the surface.<br />This is the story of Pi, an Indian teenager who, while emigrating from India to Canada with his family, winds up being  the sole human survivor when the ship sinks.  The emphasis is on &quot;human&quot; as he winds up sharing his lifeboat with a tiger, orangutan, hyena and zebra, a small menagerie from the ship's holds who were to be transported to various zoos.  Nature takes its course until only the tiger is left, and Pi is forced to form an uneasy alliance with the cat.  There is little that is sentimental in this relationship and no sweet friendship; the tiger remains a dangerous carnivore and never cute or cuddly.<br />This has most of what you would want in a story: humor, suspense, adventure, and mystery.  Add to this, a healthy portion of theology and a good serving of horror and this is a complete literary meal, both tasty and with the recommended daily allowance of quality.	2003-04-12

His earlier novels often had adventurous sorts (ex-assassins, soldiers, et cetera) battling ... conspiracies.  His more recent works have dealt with more human adventures, sometimes with more success than others (I personally find Double Image one of his weakest efforts).<br />In Long Lost, Brad Denning is a successful architect who is traumatized by the unsolved kidnaping of his brother twenty-five years earlier.  After being featured on national TV, he encounters a man who claims to be his brother.  While this brother appears to be genuine, knowing things only Brad's brother could know, the experienced reader will know that something bad is afoot.<br />And something bad does happen.  The brother tries to [end the life of] Brad and kidnaps his wife and son.  The FBI assists and tells Brad that the culprit was someone impersonating his brother, but are no good at finding Brad's family.  It is up to Brad to figure out if the kidnaper is his brother or not and more importantly to rescue his family.<br />This is a pure suspense novel, a great page turner.  Morrell isn't interested in any great insights into human nature, just entertaining, and he succeeds well.  A week from reading this, you'll have forgotten the characters names and the settings will begin to fade, but you'll still remember the most important thing:  that you had a blast while reading this book.	2003-04-12
US	43083835	R24GR1LZIO3QCR	0801859131	97172504	Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Democracy, 1833-1845	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Jackson Part 3	The final volume in Robert Remini's definitive biography of Andrew Jackson follows the life of the seventh president from the beginning of his second term through the end of his life.  In it, we see many of the things that made Jackson one of our most important presidents despite his significant flaws.<br />Prior to Jackson's presidency, the executive office was much weaker.  The designers of the Constitution, with their fears of strong central figures, had intended Congress to be the most powerful of the supposedly co-equal branches.  Jackson, however, viewed himself as the sole representative of the people - the only person elected by a nation, not a region - and through various measures such as an expansion of the use of the veto, was able to shift the balance of power.  Although the following presidents would be weaker, the presidency as an office had been redefined.<br />As the book begins, Jackson's second term was beginning and he needed to deal with South Carolina and the Nullification Crisis.  Essentially successful with this problem, he also dealt with other issues, including his war with the Bank of the United States and bad relations with France.  By many measures, his presidency was a success, but there were a number of negatives as well, in particular his treatment of Indians and his disregard of slavery issues.  His appointment of Taney to Chief Justice would eventually lead to the Dred Scott decision.  Remini finds more positives than negatives with Jackson, but he doesn't disregard the black marks.<br />Probably only Washington was as universally adored in his time as Jackson was, and unlike Washington, Jackson was a true man of the people, a populist who courteously met with rich and poor alike.  Even after his retirement, his popularity guaranteed his continued political clout, and few Democrats defied his wishes while he was alive.<br />The three volumes in this biography are around 1300 pages (plus notes and indexes), but Remini is such a good writer that this is far from a burdensome read.  There may be shorter biographies of Jackson, but there aren't better.  Remini knows this era well (he also has written excellent biographies of Clay and Webster) and he brings it to life.	2003-04-10
US	43083835	RVQICBTZN2ARK	0345413903	521290095	The Murder Book (Alex Delaware)	Books	4	4	6	N	N	A comeback novel	In the past few Alex Delaware novels, Jonathan Kellerman has put forth weak efforts and I was questioning whether the series would ever improve.  Happily, The Murder Book is Kellerman's best book since Billy Straight and his best Delaware book since...I'm not sure, but it's been a while.<br />The story itself is an almost overly convoluted tale of a twenty year old murder that Alex's cop buddy Milo had briefly investigated as a rookie and who some mysterious figure wants reopened.  As it deals a lot with Milo, the story alternates between Alex's standard first-person narrative and a third-person viewpoint following Milo, and we get a better look at both characters.<br />That, in fact, is where this book succeeds.  In recent novels, Delaware is a boring, virtual non-character.  Here, his personality is beginning to redevelop.  He's not all that likable, actually, but he is at least human.  Milo actually comes off looking better than Alex.  Unfortunately, the weakness in the previous novels harms the subplot of Alex's separation from longtime girlfriend Robin.  She has spent so much time in previous novels just briefly appearing for an obligatory sex scene that the reader has no real interest in her or their possible breakup.<br />So this book is far from perfect and is at best a weak four stars, but it is a drastic improvement over Kellerman's other recent works.  If you were like me and just barely hanging on to reading this series, you should definitely pick this one up.  It's a generally good read and a pleasant surprise from an author breaking out of a quality slump.	2003-04-10
US	43083835	RKFZTAYRB44KC	0142001805	89209679	The Eyre Affair: A Thursday Next Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Offbeat and entertaining	From the way that the Eyre Affair has been promoted, one would think that Jasper Fforde was the successor of Douglas Adams.  While Fforde is a good writer - even better than Adams in his later books - the Eyre Affair is not like the Hitchhiker's series and any who look for that may be disappointed.<br />Which is a shame, because this is still a very good book; while it does have humorous moments and there is a heap of witty wordplay, this is not truly a comic novel; there is too much grimness in places.  A fairer comparison to make would be to say that this is a surreal version of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books.<br />Tuesday Next is a police officer of sorts who investigates literary crimes.  She lives in an alternate Britain where the Crimean war continues, people prefer blimps to planes, and literature and art are taken very seriously:  Baconians go door to door trying to convince people that Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays, and Surrealists war in the street with fans of Impressionism.  There may be no movies such as the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but people will indulge in Richard III instead of that cult film.<br />Next is called in to help detain the vicious Acheron Hades, a thorough villain who delights in evil and has almost supernatural powers.  Through a device that allows people to enter and leave stories, he plans on wreaking havoc with the greatest English novels, elaborating on a similar idea in a Woody Allen short story (The Kugelmass Episode) in Allen's book Side Effects.  There is a lot more in the Eyre Affair, however, including vampires, werewolves, time holes and much more.<br />This is a fun although sometimes confusing read.  As I said previously, this is more serious than sometimes promoted, but you should laugh, nonetheless.  In any case, it's a lighter read than Jane Eyre, which in a way, you get to read at the same time.	2003-04-01

In around 300 pages, Monk has put together an excellent book about the Constitution: informative enough so most readers will get something out of it but not so technical that it will turn those readers off.<br />Monk explains every sentence in the Constitution and the amendments, giving historical background and showing how the clauses and articles have been interpreted and acted on over the years.  She remains objective but does not shy from controversy; when discussing such hot button issues as gun control, abortion and the death penalty, she presents both sides of the arguments, and by providing excerpts of writings by others, allows other opinions to be shown.<br />So why should every American read this book.  Simply because this is a great introduction to the document that dictates life in the United States.  An informed American is better than an ignorant one, especially in the voting booth.  You may not be a full-fledged Constitutional scholar when you finish this book, but you will at least understand this document a bit better.	2003-04-01

Not that the character's life is comic, but like the play, his is a story of being separated at birth from a twin brother.  This event sends the two boys on life paths that are as similar as they are different.<br />This type of novel is Jeffrey Archer's forte: a tale of parallel lives, following two characters as their lives intersect and diverge.  This worked best in Kane &amp; Abel, although First Among Equals is also good.  The Fourth Estate, however, suffers from its lack of likable protagonists.  In this book, however, Nat Cartwright and Fletcher Davenport are pleasant enough.<br />That is perhaps this novel's great failing; the characters are never really true adversaries, even in the final part of the book when they are in competition.  Instead, they have only one enemy in common, a weaselly rival who is almost completely virtueless but is often inexplicably successful.  <br />Fortunately, Archer makes the twins fraternal, not identical, reducing the cliches of them just missing each other or not having anyone else catch on.  Unfortunately, the fact that they are related plays little part in the story, and when all is eventually revealed, it is with a thud, not a bang.<br />Despite these flaws, this story still rates a weak four stars.  Archer is a skillful writer and he is able to make his story entertaining even if inferior to his other works.  This is a novel that may irritate you after you get done reading it, but while you are in the middle, you will be drawn in and have fun.  Overall, Archer has written another good book, shallow but still good.	2003-03-30

Jefferson Parker's series featuring Orange County, California detective Merci Rayborn.  Merci is a single mother (the father having died in the first book) and an ambitious cop whose dreams of being sheriff have diminished after making enemies in the department in the second book.  Her new case offers a chance at redemption but even a bigger chance of endangering her career again.<br />The case is a deputy who has apparently killed his wife and then attempted suicide.  There are many who are ready to leap to this conclusion - not wanting the Sheriff's department to look like it's covering things up - but Merci has her doubts, which are strengthened as she continues her investigation.<br />Merci's not the only one seeking the truth.  The severely wounded deputy, despite shards of bullets in his brain, is out to find answers and vengeance.  He is almost a supernatural force, a seemingly undead being who knows his own life is limited and only has a mission to sustain him.<br />Parker is an accomplished writer who as always delivers an entertaining novel.  The only problem I have is the inclusion of the first chapter which shows the deputy's innocence.  If the reader doesn't know this, it deepens the mystery.  While solid enough entertainment, it admittedly does not have the spectacular quality that merits five stars.  But four stars is enough to make this a recommended read for mystery fans.	2003-03-28

The God Emperor is gone, the Atreides clan has faded from its former prominence, and, as always, there are a number of groups struggling for dominance.<br />With so many specialized types of humans and prolonged lifespans, it is not overly surprising that civilization has not undergone any truly drastic changes since Leto II's transformation.  This book focuses on the Bene Gesserit, the sisterhood who have grand designs for humanity.  Among others jockeying for power are the Tleilaxu who have mastered biology in other fashions.  More dangerous still are the Honored Matres, a powerful organization that is a dark doppleganger of the Bene Gesserit.  <br />Of course, there is another Duncan Idaho who is a pawn in all this scheming, but the most interesting characters are Miles Teg - a master warrior called out of retirement to mentor Duncan - and Sheeanna, a young girl who can command the sand worms of Rakis (the former Arrakis).  Sheanna is probably the most refreshing character this series has had in a while; she behaves like a real child, and isn't a grand schemer unlike every other character.<br />This is still good science fiction.  Dune/Rakis/Arrakis is not as central as in previous books, and the role of sex is much more important, at times even overshadowing the spice.  At first, the story is a bit disorienting - there are no familiar characters until Duncan appears - but things pick up quickly enough.  All the Dune books conclude with a new order imposed on the galaxy and this book is no exception.  What that new order is, however, is for the reader to find out.<br />The Dune series is not always easy to read, but it is a complex and worthwhile classic of science fiction.  For those who have enjoyed the previous books, this book will continue the pleasure.	2003-03-28

Dick, Vol. 5)	Books	4	17	21	N	N	Later but not necessarily better	In this final volume of the Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, we get a chance to read the short stories he wrote from the late 1960s to his death.  For those who were accustomed to the imaginative and off-beat work of the first four volumes, this last book may be a bit jarring:  as Dick's life got stranger, so did his stories.  Even in the genre of the strange that is science fiction, stranger is not automatically better.<br />Some of the stories in this collection are every bit as good as the ones in the other books.  Tales such as \\"The Pre-Persons,\\" \\"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\\" and \\"The Electric Ant\\" are among his better stories.  There are also stories that would eventually become novels like Counter-Clock World, Dr. Bloodmoney and The Divine Invasion.  Then there are the previously unpublished works...which are strictly for PKD completists; there is good reason these were not published.<br />His later short stories, like his later novels (Valis, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer) are often permeated with the theological and hallucinogenic qualities that also dominated Dick's life.  These later stories are dominated more by ideas than by good writing; compare the title story to the similarly themed Waterspider in Volume 4 and you'll see the earlier story is far better.<br />Overall this book rates a weak four stars, although the whole set rates a full five stars.  Even if a bit disappointing compared with the previous books, this still has enough quality to be well worth reading.	2003-03-22
US	43083835	R3EJ3R5DZIIF8X	0375413634	70225414	The Emperor of Ocean Park	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Uneven entertainment	In The Emperor of Ocean Park, Stephen Carter, author of several non-fiction works, has had tried his hand at fiction with mixed success.  While Carter shows potential for being a good writer - and while a lot of the book is entertaining - there are enough flaws to merit only a three star review, though it would at least be a high three stars.<br />The principal flaw seems to be that Carter is not quite sure what type of book he wants to write.  On the one hand, he seems to be writing a version of the Great American Novel, an epic tale of the trials of one family.  On the other hand, he has written a complex mystery filled with conspiracy and riddles.  Although I enjoy both genres, Carter is unable to make them mesh well.  The mystery detracts from the realism, and the serious, literary qualities dampen the suspense.<br />Carter also tends towards wordiness; maybe his legal background has forced him to be overly detailed.  This affects the pacing.  Not much happens for the first hundred pages and the last hundred are left to explaining most things (but not everything).  The middle four hundred pages, however, are quite good.<br />Finally, the choice of the first person viewpoint seems to hurt the story.  It takes a long time for Talcott Garland to seem more like a person than an observer; he is remote, which may work well in a private eye novel, where the narrator is truly an outsider, but here Garland is the heart of the story.<br />There is not really much that is bad about the novel in the sense that the plot is entertaining, the characters are well-defined (given Carter's wordiness, perhaps too well-defined) and there is some good social commentary.  If you are a fan of mysteries (which is really what this book, in the end), you'll find this okay but not great; while you won't put Carter with the great writers, you also won't put him with the bad ones.	2003-03-20

As both a writer and an actor on Mystery Science Theater 3000, he has seen more than his fair share of cinematic atrocities.  In this collection of reviews and movie commentary, Nelson builds on his experience to write about some of the recent bad movies that have come out.  And unlike MST3K, where Nelson was limited to low budget B-movies, this book tackles the big budget flicks.<br />The result is a sometimes uneven but generally funny collection.  Nelson's experience as a humor writer pays off as he lambastes such bad movies as Lost in  Space, Mighty Joe Young and Batman &amp; Robin.  Of course, there will be some movies in here that you may think are good, but his joking is generally good-natured enough that you can enjoy his review of even those.  He even dedicates a chapter to skewering his own Mystery Science Theater movie.<br />In addition, Nelson writes about various TV shows and actors and even has a section on such cinematic dynasties as the Baldwins and the Estevez/Sheens.  It's all pretty funny, but I would recommend that it be read in small doses...too much at one time (as I read it) and you get used to the humor and it isn't quite as good.<br />Overall, this book is good for both Misties and non-Misties, just as long as you recognize the inherent humor in watching a bad movie.  For every Citizen Kane, there's at least three Waterworlds, which means Nelson will have no trouble writing a sequel whenever he wants.	2003-03-16

When we last left Andrew Jackson, he had just quit his job as governor of the Florida territory.  Having built his reputation on his military actions against Indians and his rout over the British in the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson now had two goals:  first, recovering his precarious health, and second, becoming president.<br />In this second volume of Remini's biography of the seventh president, Jackson rises to the pinnacle of his power, though it is by no means easy.  First, there is his health:  having abused his body over the years in war and duels, Jackson was not in good shape and probably spent the last decades of his life in constant pain which only his vast willpower could overcome.<br />In 1824, Jackson ran for president and despite getting a plurality of the popular and electoral votes, wound up losing to John Quincy Adams that makes the 2000 election seem non-controversial in comparison.  Getting cheated (as many felt) would lead to a second, successful campaign in 1828, but even this had a high price, as the slander he was subjected to due to the dubious circumstances of his marriage would emotionally wreck and eventually lead to the death of his wife.<br />The second half of the book focuses on Jackson's first presidential term, ending with his election to a second term.  In many ways the first populist president, Jackson redefined the role of the presidency by expanding the power of the veto (rarely used previously and only in limited circumstances) and attempted to clean up the corruption left over from the so-called \\"Era of Good Feelings.\\"<br />Remini is a great biographer and this book is every bit as great as the first volume.  He holds back few punches when it comes to Jackson's negatives, especially his treatment of Indians and his tendency to dwell incessantly on little things (such as the Eaton affair).  Nonetheless, this is a generally positive biography, as Remini demonstrates that despite the view that Jackson was an ignorant backwoodsman manipulated by his aides such as Van Buren, Jackson was both intelligent and independent.<br />This is the definitive biography of Jackson.  If you want to learn of the man or the era, this is a must-read.	2003-03-16

Leto, the son of Paul Atreides is still around, however, a semi-immortal who is the title character.<br />Paul might have been the equivalent of Julius Caesar, setting up an Empire for his successor, the Augustean Leto.  Leto has established his own version of Pax Romana, creating a government that has remained in power over three millenia.  The price of this peace is obvious:  civilization has stagnated and many of the same institutions are still around, despite a time gap similar to the time of the mythical Agammemnon/Atreides to our modern day.<br />Leto is extremely powerful, not only physically and intellectually, but economically as well.  His Achilles heel (speaking metaphorically as his worm-like body no longer has heels) is his simultaneous development towards worm-hood and his vague longings for his humanity.  Among his allies/opponents is Duncan Idaho, the latest in a series of Idaho clones that have served Leto and have often died trying to assassinate him.<br />The book focuses on Leto's scheming about the human race and those who oppose him.  While quite interesting and entertaining, it would sometimes be nice if Herbert's characters were a little less serious.  No one speaks or does anything frivolously; it is all part of a larger agenda.  Nonetheless, although different from the first three books, this is a worthy part of the series and a good science fiction novel.	2003-03-12

The title story deals with the murder of an old man by a pair of street thugs and the subsequent investigation and trial.  While reasonably good, it is perhaps the weakest in the bunch because the twist is not that hard to figure out.  The other stories include a caper story set in the art world, a brief World War II story, a tale about drug smuggling (also with a rather obvious twist), and finally, a short novel about a survivor of the Battle of Little Bighorn.  This final story is the best in the bunch, with a radical and unexpected change in the middle of the story.<br />Forsyth's greatest works are in novels, not short stories, but overall, this collection holds up well.  Forsyth fans should be pleased as should general suspense fans.	2003-03-10

In the cases of High Fidelity and About a Boy, seeing the movie first didn't limit my enjoyment of the book, and in this case, even without a film adaptation, I still found the book to be quite entertaining.<br />The book is the story of Katie Carr, a doctor who is disillusioned with both marriage and parenthood.  Her husband has a rather snide streak, but when he undergoes a personality change, she learns to long for her old husband.  He has gone from selfish and self-absorbed to extremely selfless, the result of an encounter with a strange New Age healer called GoodNews.<BR>The husband's conversion makes him even harder to live with and forces Katie and her children to reexamine their own values.<br />Although a generally comic novel, there are definite bits of seriousness also.  Katie is a distinctly flawed character, and while you often sympathize with her ordeal, other times she is completely unsympathetic (as even she realizes).  Her husband is an interesting character as he remains equally distant from his wife no matter what his approach to life is.  And GoodNews is more complex than a simple charlatan, if he even is somehow a fake.<br />The story does drag in places as Katie seems to spin her wheels a lot, takes little action and can't even decide what to do next.  Overall, however, this is a fun and insightful novel and I look forward to the next Hornby book I read.	2003-03-10

In this fourth volume of the five-book collection of Dick's short stories, it is put forth (in the amusing \\"Waterspider\\") that science fiction authors are actually pre-cognitive.  In a later story, PKD himself foretells Richard Nixon's election to the Presidency in 1968...four years before the event!  Probably a lucky guess, but who knows....<br />This collection comprises stories written in the late 1950s and early '60s, a period when Dick was also taking off as a novelist.  Some of this has had an influence on his short stories, which are generally longer than before, and which, in some cases are early versions of what would eventually become novels such as the Simulacra and the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch.<br />Generally speaking, these are all good to great stories.  The title story - made into a movie last year - is a clever little mystery, and that is just one of the gems within.  Although most of the stories are disconnected, many involve precognition and most have a bit of dark humor running them.  Some - such as Orpheus with Clay Feet - are strictly humorous, while others are far more serious.<br />As with the other volumes in this series, this is a great collection with very little in the way of bad stories - quite an accomplishment considering how quickly some of these were cranked out.  For fans of science fiction, especially the off-beat sort which was Dick's specialty, this is highly recommended.	2003-03-08

For an author with more than his fair share of 1000+ page books, this is little more than a novelette: less than 200 pages of relatively big print (plus a copy of the Constitution and in my edition, a forty page preview of Alaska).<br />Written in the bicentennial year of the Constitution, Legacy is Michener's weak ode to the venerable document.  In the mid-1980s, Major Norman Starr faces a crisis when called to face a Senate committee for his role in the Iran-Contra affair; as he prepares his defense, he reminisces on the roles his ancestors have played in history.   This creates a series of banal biographies of fictional characters.<br />Good historical novels work one of two ways; either telling the story of a real historical figure or telling the tale of a purely fictional character who may meet real people, but whose own historical influence is minor.  Michener goes a third, rather flawed way by having his fictional characters creating history.  <br />I'm not sure who Michener was aiming this book towards.  His usual fans would be put off by the bad history, complete with anachronistic speech (such as when an 18th century character uses the 19th century word, &quot;millionaire&quot;).  As a tribute to the Constitution, it is rather tepid.  For younger readers, the narrative is too slow and actionless to sustain interest.  In short, this is a book for Michener completists only.	2003-03-06

Vol. 1	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Top-notch biography	Andrew Jackson is one of the more complicated figures in American history.  On the one hand, his significance to the development of the United States as a nation is large.  On the other hand, he was often a very unpleasant person.<br />This first volume in Robert Remini's biography follows Jackson's life from his childhood through his governorship of Florida.  Along the way, we learn of Jackson's brief roles in both houses of Congress and his period as a judge; it is later, however, when he joined the military (becoming a general through politics rather than merit), that Jackson rose to nationwide prominence, especially his overwhelming humiliation of the British in the Battle of New Orleans and his later dealings with Indians and the Spanish which led eventually to the U.S. acquiring Florida.<br />His military victories made him one of the most popular people in American history, but Remini pulls no punches with Jackson's flaws, including his often brutal and bullying nature and his tendency to violence.  The ambiguous circumstances involving how he married his wife Rachel would lead to nasty talk during his presidential campaigns and his killing of a man in a duel (was it murder?) wouldn't help either.<br />Having been previously exposed to Remini's writing through his brilliant biographies of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, I knew this book would be a pleasure to read, and it was.  Remini has written the definitive biography of Jackson, very detailed but always objective and always entertaining.  If you want to learn of this era and of one its pivotal figures, this is the book to read (plus the other two in the series).	2003-03-06

Yes, this novel is comic and in Florida, but Hiaasen has changed his narrative style to tell his tale.<br />Basket Case is the story of Jack Tagger, a typical Hiaasen hero who is a reporter and somewhat down on his luck.  After enraging the paper's owner, Tagger has been condemned to writing obituaries.  When a once-famous rock singer dies, Tagger writes the obit and gets a suspicion that foul play was involved...a feeling reinforced when other members of the band also start dying.  Tagger sees this as an opportunity to get to the front page again and pursues the mystery.<br />Unlike Hiaasen's other stories, this novel is told in the first person and the present tense.  While still a good story, it winds up limiting his usual abilities.  Limited to Tagger's point-of-view, we cannot follow some of the other interesting characters.  Of course, there are no really bizarre characters in this story, which is also a change of pace.  <br />In the end, this is a good novel with no real flaws but nothing really standout either; I had fun reading it, but it was not the pure delight of a Tourist Season or a Native Tongue.  Hiaasen has written a should-read, not a must-read.	2003-03-01

Dick's short fiction, Second Variety and Other Classic Stories is a worthwhile read for any PKD fan.<br />Dick cranked out stories very quickly in his early years, and some of these tales do have a certain sense of being rushed, but others, including the title story are nothing short of brilliant.  As usual, Dick focuses on dystopic futures that are politically and/or environmentally ravaged; usually these stories have a level of humor too, but others in this collection are more purely downbeat.<br />While some stories are just okay, I particularly enjoyed \\"The Golden Man,\\" \\"Second Variety\\" and \\"Foster, You're Dead.\\"  There are some other great ones, too.  I would recommend this to any science fiction fan who wants to read some truly original fiction; this is another good collection of Dick's short stories.	2003-03-01

Although there are six books total, the first three form a trilogy, essentially the biography of Paul Atreides and his family (the other books take place much later).  Dune, the first book, is a definite classic in science fiction, while Dune Messiah is a weaker yet still good sequel.  Children of Dune fits somewhere between the two in quality.<br />As the book opens, Paul is believed to be dead, a martyr last seen nine years earlier.  The political and religious empire he had created is prospering under his sister, Alia, who is acting as regent until Paul's twin children come of age.  With indications of decadence already appearing, a mysterious Preacher is speaking out against the failings of this empire, and there are those who believe that this Preacher may be Paul.<br />One of the reasons that this book is stronger than the second book is the return of Lady Jessica, absent since the end of the first book.  With her daughter Alia seeming possessed by the spirit of Baron Harkonnen (one of the great villains of sci-fi), Jessica becomes entangled in plots that could be fatal to her and her grandchildren.  The twins themselves, intellectually far older than their physical ages and gifted with inherited talents, are hardly helpless in all this intriguing.<br />If you have enjoyed the first two Dune books, this is a must read, as it brings many plot lines to a close even as it opens new possibilities for future books.  As in real life, Herbert understands that historical (even future historical) events rarely wrap up neatly, and a conclusion is merely a beginning of a different phase of history.  This adds to the richness of this book and makes this series one of the landmarks of the genre.	2003-02-24

Originally published in 1997, it didn't come out in paperback till 2003 (and the hardcover disappeared), while other later Crais novels (including another Cole book) did the usual hardcover-to-paperback cycle and remained on the shelves.  Whatever the reason, it's here now and it's really good.<br />Elvis Cole, self-proclaimed World's Greatest Detective, is hired by three children to find their father.  Motivated more by conscience than money, he helps them.  When it turns out that the father is on the run from the Russian mob, Elvis starts getting in over his head.  Fortunately, there is his laconic partner Pike to watch his back.<br />Mystery fans will see a certain similarity between the Cole books and Robert Parker's Spenser.  Both feature wise-cracking tough private eyes with mysterious but generally good-hearted partners.  Unfortunately, over the years, I found Spenser getting unlikably smug and self-righteous, while Cole remains a pleasure to read about.  And both Cole and Pike are much more well-developed than either Spenser or Hawk, neither of whom even reveal their full names (the single-named hero is a bit of a tired gimmick nowadays...Richard Stark's Parker is forgiven because he's been around since the mid-60's).<br />You don't need to have read other Elvis Cole novels to get into this one; Crais makes it easy to get right into things.  For fans of the private-eye novel, you'll find this - like all the other novels by Crais - delightfully entertaining.	2003-02-22

Dick, Vol. 2)	Books	5	29	30	N	N	More early works from one of the masters	It is a credit to Philip K. Dick's talent that even in his early days - at a time when he was cranking out stories just to keep food on the table - that he was able to write so much fiction that is not only good, but great.<br />In this second volume of a five book set that includes essentially all his short works, we get to read more of his earliest tales and find there is little to disappoint here.  The title piece is the short story which was adapted into the movie Total Recall.  I like the movie well enough, but outside the premise, there is little that is really similar to the original story, which has much more of an emphasis on the comic than on action.<br />In fact, the majority of these stories have a comic touch.  Since these are tales of dark futures - most involve Earth's that are either environmentally wrecked or repressive dictatorships - the humor prevents things from getting too depressing.<br />You don't have to be a Dick fan to enjoy these stories, nor even much of a science fiction fan (though it helps); this is just a fantastic collection of short stories that are both fun and thought-provoking.  What more could you want?	2003-02-22

Every beautiful woman you meet wants to sleep with you and every client you have is willing to pay for you to live in high-style.  Sure, you get mildly roughed up or shot every now and then, but the pain is minor and fleeting and insignificant compared with all the pleasures.<br />As with every Barrington novel, the Short Forever begins at Elaine's, late.  Stone's girlfriend from the previous book dumps him to marry a rich guy (not unlike what his previous and recurring girlfriend Arrington once did), which causes a single night of grief before Stone recovers and goes to England on a case.  In England, he gets one new lover and two old ones (including Arrington) and since three women aren't enough, he eventually hits on a fourth one, although not much happens with that one (I think that's being saved for another book).<br />Somewhere in all this, Stone also gets in the middle of two spies, one retired and out to sell a mysterious weapon, and the other out to stop him at any cost.  For Stone, this is often more of a distraction than a regular case, but it does get him tangled up with some murders and other crimes.<br />This is the so-called beach read, light and entertaining and a fast read, but far from spectacular.  Woods is very good at these novels, but the Barrington novels are not his best writing.  In fact, almost all his other works are better.  Nonetheless, this is not a bad book and will keep you amused even if you know it's not very good either.	2003-02-19

It is a fantastic blend of political intrigue, religion, science, ecology and adventure.  In looking at a fictitious future, it also reflected on the past, in particular on how religions were founded, especially Islam.  Any similarities between Paul Atreides and Mohammed are definitely not coincidental.<br />Dune concludes with Paul triumphant, the spiritual and political leader of the desert planet Arrakis having seized the Galactic Emperorship.  Dune Messiah opens twelve years later with Paul at the crest of his power, his religious movement having been spread throughout the galaxy, whether other people wanted it or not.  Billions have died, but Paul has been successful, even if he isn't certain if that is what he really wanted.  Trapped by his own power, Paul cannot take pleasure in his victories.  And since he is so powerful, both a prophet and a political leader, he has enemies who constantly plot his downfall.<br />While a good novel, Dune Messiah focuses too much on the political intrigue and loses some of the complex richness the previous book had.  Also, the absence of Paul's mother, Jessica and Gurney Halleck (among other characters from the first novel) leaves the reader wanting more.  Instead, we get the return of Duncan Idaho, a relatively minor character in the first book who has an importance on several levels in this book.<br />As with many sequels, this should not be read without having read the predecessor.  Fans of Dune should read this book and will not be overly disappointed, even if they are not overly satisfied either.	2003-02-19
US	43083835	R1401F9CEAOVQD	0446612510	975167753	The Fourth Perimeter	Books	1	5	5	N	N	Weak thriller	To read the plot summary on the back of this book, you'd think you were going to read an exciting political thriller.  But, as the old saying goes, you should not judge a book by its cover.  This is a tepid action novel that may be a fast read, but has little else to recommend it.<br />Kurt Ford is an ex-Secret Service agent who is now a billionaire entrepeneur.  His son, a Secret Service agent himself, is killed in an act that is apparently suicide but quickly is revealed to be murder.   When Ford learns the President himself apparently ordered the killing, he decides that the only appropriate revenge is assassination.<br />It sounds intriguing enough, but there are flaws aplenty.  For one thing, there is actually not all that much action.  The middle two hundred pages focus primarily on Ford's assassination plotting, with little else really going on.  Ford himself isn't all that bright, accepting the premise that the President is guilty after relatively little investigation.  In fact, there are no interesting characters in the whole book; the villains are bland, the President is a relatively apolitical standard politician, and Ford himself is hardly worth turning the pages.<br />The plotting is equally subpar.  The prologue, which lets the reader know that the son is definitely a murder victim, should have been eliminated to add a little mystery to the story.  But Green apparently assumes the worst in the reader: besides the prologue problem, it takes the reader very little time to know exactly who the bad guy is, and Green doesn't allow a single plot twist that can't be seen a mile away.  Even the epilogue rattles under the weight of cliches.<br />I have no idea if this work is typical of Green or not; I doubt very much I'll take a chance with another of his books.  If you like a good political thriller, look elsewhere; you won't find it here.	2003-02-15
US	43083835	R39FPWYHWALDML	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	One of the all-time classics	One of the landmark novels in science fiction, Dune is worthy of its rank as a classic.  Prior to its appearance in the mid-1960s, few science fiction novels even approached its level of depth.<br />The story, which follows Paul Atreides and his growth into the messianic Muad'Dib, is rich in detail.  There is a feudalistic galactic empire with all the attendant political intrigues.  There are numerous religious movements, some operating more scientifically, others quite mystically.  And there is the subtle character of the planet Arrakis (or Dune) itself, whose hostile environment, precious spice resources and devastating sandworms make it not only the most important planet in the galaxy, but also arguably the most interesting planet in science fiction.<br />There is too much here to detail in one review.  While it is not perfect - Herbert does have his writing flaws - the imperfections pale in comparison to the importance of this novel to the genre.  Just as the Lord of the Rings is an essential fantasy read, this book is a must read for any science fiction fan.	2003-02-15

Others are the diet plate, good for you but not very tasty.  Tepper Isn't Going Out is cotton candy: sweet, light, quickly consumed...an enjoyable mid-afternoon snack.<br />Calvin Trillin's novel follows New Yorker Murray Tepper, a mild-mannered man with a mild-mannered job and a mild-mannered family.  In short, he's a pleasant but unspectacular man who has started parking his car throughout the city and just enjoying his spot, sitting and reading the paper.  Initially irritating other drivers who want his spot, Tepper eventually develops a following as people visit him in his car and relate their problems to him.  Tepper's advice is minimal, but seems to always work.<br />Opposing him is the mayor, an extreme parody of Rudy Guliani who is obsessed with the forces of chaos and finds Tepper to be a vicious social agitator.  Thus, without really doing anything, Tepper becomes a minor hero and is getting lots of notice from both press and politicians.<br />This is a wonderful little story, both funny and well-written.  Trillin shows that his gift for humor is as strong as ever.  Like cotton candy, you won't really get a lot of great &quot;nutrition&quot; here, but you will have a good time.  And unlike cotton candy, there is no risk of cavities here.	2003-02-11

First in the bunch would probably be the square root of two, which was kind of the &quot;first&quot; irrational number.  Then there is the everpresent pi, and then the less well-known but completely important &quot;e&quot;.  If there was a fourth place prize, however, it would probably go to the golden number, phi, or roughly 1.618.<br />In this book, Livio gives a brief history of mathematics and phi's place in it.  Intimately related to the Fibonacci numbers, a sequence of numbers in which any given number is the sum of the previous two (after the first couple); these numbers (1,1,2,3,5,8,13...) have shown up in some unlikely places such as sunflowers and nautilus shells.  Livio shows us the significance of phi in both the mathematical and physical world.<br />Livio also makes a good case that phi may be the most overrated of all numbers.  Although it has a wonderfully golden name, it actually doesn't live up to its reputation; Livio shows that phi's presence in art and architecture is more fictional than real and that there is nothing about phi that automatically confers aesthetic beauty.  A good portion of the book is dedicated to debunking these golden myths.<br />Overall, this is a good book.  Livio's writing is appealing to both mathematician and non-mathematician alike.  He does have a tendency to meander from his topic, which can be distracting (even if entertaining), although he eventually does get back on track.  For those who like reading about math and the significance of certain numbers (I have also read books on pi, e, i, 0 and infinity), this is a worthwhile read.	2003-02-09

Dick, Vol. 1) (Vol 1)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Early works from a master	In this first book in a five-volume set collecting all the short stories of Philip K. Dick, we get a chance to see the first stories he wrote and published and can learn that from the very start, Dick was a great writer.<br />This is one of those rare story collections where there absolutely NO bad stories.  Each one is a well-written and interesting piece; some have a dark humor, others are utterly horrifying, but each one is good or great in its own way.<br />Written in the 1950s, these stories are a refreshing change of pace from some of the more banal sci-fi pieces to come out of that era.  The emphasis here is not on the science (which is often unexplained) but on the fiction: the characters, the mood and the plot.  Adept at the plot twist, Dick often resolves his stories in logical but unanticipated ways.<br />From evil toys and malicious butterflies to trolls and lethal towels, Dick puts us in a number of worlds not far removed from our own and entertains us from first page to last.  I look forward to reading the other four volumes in this set; some of the stories I have read before and others I haven't, but I'm sure I'll have a blast with all of them.	2003-02-08

As a result, the protagonist Rob doesn't realize when he does have a good thing.  Breaking up with girlfriend Laura doesn't even initially faze his; among break-ups, it doesn't even make his top five.  But soon enough, he is a wreck.<br />His life after their break-up is both humorous and sad.  The best humor actually comes from his record shop where he and his employees have a chance to display their musical knowledge and snobbery; Rob probably insults every reader somehow with all the musicians he puts down but it is done with a light touch.<br />The story of Rob and Laura will never be mistaken for their Dick van Dyke show namesakes.  Their relationship is at best rocky, but Rob's efforts to become a better person, though awkward are refreshing.  Will there be a happily ever after?  Hornby is good at letting you know that such things are really rare, but there is at least the possibility.	2003-02-05

When last seen, Thorn was recovering from a mad doctor's unnecessary treatments, but now (without any real explanation) he is back to peak health and enjoying the mellow life of fishing, beer and beautiful women.<br />In this story, his idyllic life is disrupted when a plane crashes while he is out at sea.  It soon becomes apparent that this crash was not accidental, but is the result of a dysfunctional family and the nasty weapon they have developed.  This also gets Thorn entangled with Alexandra Rafferty, the heroine of Hall's previous novel, Body Language.<br />For Hall, one of the sharper writers in the field, this is not his best effort.  Compared to past novels, his villains this time are only slightly warped and the chemistry between Thorn and Alex is relatively minimal.  In addition, Thorn isn't as interesting as in the past, perhaps getting stuck in the rut of many series characters.  <br />Nonetheless, even weaker Hall is entertaining reading, and there is a lot of fun along the way.  If you've never read Hall, you'd think this was pretty good crime fiction (and you'll be even happier when you read his other books).  If you are a Hall fan, you should find this slightly disappointing, but still a worthwhile read.	2003-02-05

The most well-known fact about him is that he was the only president who never married. The immediate predecessor of Abraham Lincoln and often blamed for elevating the conditions leading to the Civil War, Buchanan has had a poor reputation over the years.  In this biography, Klein offers some insight into this political figure.<br />Klein traces Buchanan's development from childhood through the political arena.  Having served in both houses of Congress, as a minister to both Russia and England and as Secretary of State, Buchanan was well-qualified to get the highest office in the land.  A candidate several times over the years, he finally reached the presidency in 1856, benefiting from being overseas during the Pierce administration and thus removed from the increasingly serious regional conflicts.<br />Buchanan's strengths were also his flaws.  His political canniness and ability to avoid major controversies led to his successes but also prevented him from being an effective leader.  In fact, he tried to avoid being a leader, feeling that wasn't the purpose of his position.  While it is unlikely that he could have averted the Civil War, he wound up being ineffective in even slowing down the drive to conflict.  There is also every indication that if war had broken out during his tenure, things would have played out with less immediate violence but with far severer damage to the nation.  Ironically, it would be the less qualified Lincoln who would be the superior president.<br />If the life of Pierce tells of a man who was unqualified and made a poor president, Buchanan's life shows that experience isn't everything either.  Klein has written a great book that lets us know more about this quiet figure; with so few biographies of Buchanan available, it is a happy fact that this one is not only probably the best available, but is also just a good historical biography in general.general.	2003-02-05

He may not be the big name that King, Barker or Koontz is, but for those who know him, Simmons is one standout writer.<br />In A Winter Haunting, Simmons returns to the world of Summer of Night, a rather nostalgic horror story that has kids confronting supernatural evil in the early 1960s.  Now, four decades later, Dale Stewart is returning to where the horrors took place.  Although technically a sequel, this is a much different story from the first book (unlike, say Black House by King and Straub, which is much more of a follow-up to the Talisman, and also brings back a child hero as an adult).<br />Stewart has a number of problems in his life, principally his ruined marriage followed by his being dumped by the girlfriend who he left his wife for.  His life in tatters, saved from suicide by a freak incident, Stewart returns to his home town and starts facing his past and some horrific events as well.<br />Simmons does a great job in keeping things moving.  We are usually uncertain if anything truly supernatural is going on or whether Stewart is going insane or maybe both.  This constant doubt makes the story that much better.<br />Dan Simmons was born in 1948, which makes him the same age as Stewart.  Both have the same initials, both are novelists, and Stewart is attempting to write his own version of Summer of Night.  What this means is uncertain, but it does kind of make this a fictional autobiography, which adds another level to the mystery.  Even if pure coincidence, it takes nothing away.  Good at science fiction, good at mysteries, Simmons has returned to his writing roots with this great horror novel.	2003-01-28

Why was it that Europe conquered North America and not vice-versa?  Jared shows that the causes date back to the origins of humanity.<br />The reasons Diamond describes are several but primarily focus on geography, botany and zoology, in particular the shape of the major continents and the availability of easily domesticated plants and animals.  The areas that had the proper combination had people who shifted from nomadic hunter-gatherers to sedentary farmers.<br />While this book is good, eventually Diamond repeats himself, and he hardly states anything original in the second half of the book.  Thus, while the first half is intriguing and education, the second half is redundant and tedious.  The five star quality of the first half and two star quality of the second half balances to 3.5, which I have rounded up.<br />Diamond also has something of a bias against civilizations, often referring to them sardonically as kleptocracies; on the other hand, he reveres the simpler societies and seems to lament their inevitable decline.  This slant may turn off some readers, but if you can overlook this bias, you'll find that this book is very insightful.  And if you only read half of it, that will be enough to get all you need from it.	2003-01-28

In Mohawk, his first novel, we see, if somewhat imperfectly, the writer he would become.<br />Like his other novels, Mohawk is the story of a small town in the northeastern part of the U.S.  The town - in this case Mohawk - is a place on the wane as the industry that fueled it peters out.  In this story, we follow the adventures of Dallas Younger, his ex-wife Anne and their son Randall in the late '60s and early '70s.  Dallas lives a life of general irresponsibility and likes it that way.  Anne pines away for her cousin's husband, a wheelchair-bound man who she sleeps with every twenty years or so.  Randall has his own issues to deal with including his efforts to evade the draft.<br />As with Russo's other stories, the characters are more important than the plot, and he is able to make them compelling enough that we want to keep reading.  Compared with his other novels, this one is rather serious, although there is some humor.<br />This novel is good but not as great as his other books; in a way, this book is like an exhibition game before the regular season; we get a general feel for what Russo does but it is still just warming up.  For example, in Dallas, we see the prototype for the deeper Sully in Nobody's Fool.  Other elements of this story are revisited in his other stories.<br />I would recommend this book, but don't judge Russo by this story.  He's just getting warmed up here.	2003-01-25

I would wonder why he was almost neglected by history while other presidents got much more press.  As I eventually learned - and as this book reaffirms - there is a reason he is almost completely ignored.  Pierce represented the nadir of the Presidency, a period that by historical circumstances and Pierce's own lack of ability made presidential power as weak as it ever would be.<br />Nichols's book describes the early life of Pierce.  The son of a Revolutionary War veteran, Pierce used his family connections and his own gifts of intelligence and oratory to rise in the local political community, first on a state level and then eventually into both houses of Congress.  While adept enough to get these positions, he never really sparkled at any of them; his period as a general in the Mexican War is similarly unimpressive.<br />The Democratic Party, desperate to find a nominee in 1852, eventually settled on Pierce, not because he was a great candidate, but - as a Northerner with distinctly pro-Southern views - he was the only candidate with wide geographical appeal.  Attaining the Presidency, he did little to calm the growing North-South rift and, in fact, left things in a sadder state than when he left.<br />Nichols portrays Pierce sympathetically enough as a man beset by poor health, a hard-to-live-with wife and a series of family tragedies, culminating with seeing the death of his last child in an accident just prior to his inauguration.  Pierce, however, was also a politician with little political awareness, oblivious to the growing conflict over slavery and with sympathies in complete contrast to that of his New Hampshire neighbors.  Compared with most of his fellow Presidents, Pierce wound up dying in ignonimy.<br />This is a good book, very detailed and with a high level of objectivity, and can be considered probably the best book on Pierce.  Originally written in the 1930s, Nichols occasionally uses language that may seem quaint to modern eyes, but this is still quite readable.  If you want to learn about Franklin Pierce (and the era leading up to the Civil War), this is a good place to start.0s, Nichols occasionally uses language that may seem quaint to modern eyes, but this is still quite readable.

But those familiar with this series know that Parker is one of the great characters in crime fiction; through Richard Stark's (Donald Westlake's) writing, Parker is a cool, methodical criminal whose adventures never cease to entertain.<br />From the very first line of this story, we are drawn in to this latest caper.  Parker is recruited to participate in stealing some art from an internet billionaire.  Having botched the theft previously, his recruiters are eager for a second chance, even with heightened security.  The art in question is very valuable and already stolen material, so there are legal authorities involved also.<br />Meanwhile, some old adversaries of Parker's from an earlier book, are out for revenge and have hired killers to dispose of the thief.  Parker's recruiters also have ex-partners to deal with.  This makes for a complex but never overly-complicated story that is fun from beginning to end.<br />Who lives?  Who dies?  Will Parker get the loot?  Fans of previous novels know that nothing is certain in one of these books; Parker doesn't win them all.  As a reader, however, you can continue a winning streak of great books by reading this one.	2003-01-19

Thus, he can appeal to the reader with almost any amount of time and can deliver.<br />Everything's Eventual, a collection of stories that King wrote in the 1990s, is designed for the reader who wants a good single-sitting work.  King is an author who has had his quality peaks and valleys, but fortunately, these stories were written while he was at one of his peaks.  As a result, most of these stories are good and a few are downright great.<br />Although King states the stories were chosen in random order, I noticed the weakest stories seemed to appear earliest.  The very first story, \\"Autopsy Room 4,\\" is not bad but is probably the weakest in the bunch; it is essentially a reworking of an old Alfred Hitchcock TV story and though given the King touch, is not very original.  The next three stories, \\"The Man in the Black Suit,\\" \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\\" and \\"Thee Death of Jack Hamilton,\\" are a bit better, but still not outstanding.<br />After that, the stories begin to get really good.  I particularly enjoyed \\"The Road Virus Heads North,\\" a take-off on the haunted picture story and \\"1408\\" where King explores another haunted hotel, this one with a single bad room unlike anything found in The Shining.<br />For King fans, this is a must read, but I would also recommend it to other readers, in particular those who enjoy short stories, which are a form of writing that is sadly on the wane.  King shows that there is still a lot of good material left in short fiction.	2003-01-19

When an author takes a couple of different series characters and puts them in the same book, the result is ofteen mixed; the characters often work well on their own but don't complement each other.<br />With Connelly, however, there is nothing but enjoyment in his team-up of Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch.  This is because this is not really a team-up:  although both characters are in the novel, they have very different roles; in addition, Connelly does not evenly balance the two; this is really a McCaleb book.<br />In this story, McCaleb is recruited to look into a ritualistic murder; his evaluation comes up with an unusual suspect, Bosch.  It doesn't help that Bosch's behavior and comments are not above suspicion, but then again, Bosch has little sympathy for the victim; in addition, he is entangled in an O.J. Simpson-style high-profile trial in which he is the key witness.<br />McCaleb and Bosch have two different agendas in this book. McCaleb's are rather evident, but since Bosch is a suspect, his motives are more ambiguous.  As readers familiar with the half-dozen other Bosch novels, we know that the killer is someone else.  Don't we?  Then again, Connelly is quite adept with the plot twist, so even Bosch isn't above suspicion.<br />It is not essential to have read the other books in the series to enjoy this one (but it doesn't hurt either).  Connelly has had quite a string of top-notch thrillers and this continues the string.  If you enjoy mysteries, you can't go wrong with this book.	2003-01-12

In this, the final book of McCullogh's series on the last decades of the Roman Republic, the last days of Julius Caesar are chronicled along with the first days of his successor,  Octavian.  For fans of historical fiction, this is a must read, a six volume epic that is part history and part political soap opera.<br />For those unfamiliar with the series, the hero is definitely Julius Caesar.  The first two books - The First Man In Rome and The Grass Crown - serve as an extended prologue, with Caesar born in the first book and in pre-adolesence in the second; nonetheless, the intrigues of Gaius Marius and Sulla keep those books quite interesting.  Caesar's rise to power is described in the next three books, and at the beginning of the October Horse, he is at the peak of his power.<br />For those familiar at all with Roman history, how Caesar dies and even the exact date are well-known.  McCullough describes the growing conspiracy and how the various figures are drawn in.  The assassination is not the conclusion of the story, however.  Instead, we see Caesar's adopted son take over and hunt down the conspirators, a good epilogue to this saga.<br />The fun part of this story is the intrigues among the various characters: the utopian Caesar, the brutish Antony, the deceptively ruthless Octavian, the weak but idealistic Brutus and many others.  McCullough fills in the gaps in the historical record with great drama and makes this novel as great as her previous ones.<br />This book might be good on its own, but to do it justice, you must read the five predecessors; besides the two mentioned above, there is Fortune's Favorites, Caesar's Women and Caesar.  That may seem like a lot of reading, but it's all good.  In addition, if you enjoy this book, you can go on to read Robert Graves's books on the early days of the Empire: I, Claudius and Claudius the God.  Reading all eight books in sequence would not only give you a great grasp of Roman history, it would also be a blast to read.	2003-01-11

Both involve pyschologists, both are told primarily in the first person, both have murder mysteries and both main characters have gruff police \\"sidekicks.\\"  The differences, however, are more important: while the Delaware books are declining in quality (for reasons best discussed in a review of Kellerman's books), the Gregory books remain consistently good.<br />In this story, the district attorney of Boulder is murdered and the prime suspect is Gregory's cop-friend's partner, Lucy.  Gregory's wife Lauren, usually a prosecutor, extends her maternity leave to help defend Lucy.  Meanwhile, Gregory gets a new patient whose son may or may not be involved with the murder, and also may or may not be planning additional killings.<br />There are suitable twists and turns in the story, but what makes this book (and the series) exciting is that no character outside the narrator is truly safe.  White has no qualms about killing previously established characters.  With a job that puts her often in danger and with an erratic but debilitating disease, even Gregory's wife is not safe from danger.<br />If you are a fan of the Kellerman books (which tend to be better sellers), than you should enjoy these books as well.  But these books are also good enough for any mystery fan to enjoy.	2003-01-05
US	43083835	RWR85H432XXAJ	1573227331	602052020	About a Boy	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	About a great book	Having watched the movie around seven months ago, I decided that reading the book upon which About a Boy is based would be a good idea.  After all, the movie was good and the books are usually better than the movies, so what could go wrong.  Happily, not much.<br />This novel is about two characters:  Will and Marcus.  Will is a shallow man who knows he is shallow and enjoys it immensely; thanks to an inheritance, he is financially independent, so he spends his days having fun and avoiding commitments.  Marcus, on the other hand, is a twelve-year-old plaugued with a depressed mother and a school where he does not fit in.  Will needs more depth in his life, and in ways, Marcus needs more shallowness.  It is left to the reader to determine who is the boy in the title.<br />This is a funny book but it also has real heart.  Done incorrectly, Will could come off unpleasant, but Hornby succeeds in making him likeable.  Marcus could come off as pathetic, but he is definitely better than that.  Since this story is character-driven (what plot there is exists only to further character development), it is essential to have interesting, multi-dimensional characters and this book has plenty of them.  Even Will, who strives to be one dimensional, has more to himself than he would like to admit.<br />For those who have seen the movie, the first two-thirds of the book is very similar to the film; on the other hand, the last portion goes in a different but successful direction.  Thus, whether you've seen the movie or not, this is a great read, fun from start to finish.	2003-01-04
US	43083835	R27SOLD8FU7JCU	0060008776	951729133	Pagan Babies	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Another great from the master	There are a lot of great crime fiction writers out there (and even more not-so-great ones).  Among the greats, Elmore Leonard stands out as one of the masters.  In this book, all of the things that make his books great are here:  crisp and realistic dialogue, morally ambiguous characters, plot twists and betrayals.  <br />In this case, Father Terry Dunn returns home to Detroit from Rwanda, where he has been a helpless witness to genocide.  Meanwhile, Debbie Dewey is just getting out of prison, intent on getting back at her ex-boyfriend who ripped her off (and who she hit with her car, hence the prison sentence). Dunn and Dewey - each with their own agendas - team up with the intention of taking the ex-boyfriend for $250,000.  Oh, and then there's the mob, too....<br />This book is fun from start to finish, another indication as to why Leonard has an almost legendary status in the field.  As in his famous quote, he leaves out the parts the people skip over, leaving only the great stuff.  There are no heroes and few villains in this story and Leonard never hints as to whether the ending will be happy, downbeat or ambiguous (and I won't either).  In his books, they can usually go any number of ways.<br />I recommend this book not only for crime fiction fans but fiction fans in general.  Leonard's skills transcend the genre and should be a great read for most people.	2003-01-03

The other was a poorly-written rabidly paranoid tract called Guns Save Lives.  Malcolm's book, while not great, is a vast improvement over the other one.<br />In this book, Malcolm traces the history of the use of firearms in England and how they related to crime rates.  Her thesis is that gun ownership has little if any negative effect on crime and in fact may make things safer.  She compares and contrasts the policies and crime rates of England and the United States and finds the U.S. policies more effective.<br />As a history, this book is pretty good, but Malcolm fluctuates between objective history and subjective opinion piece.  As a result, it often seems that she is fitting her history to support a specific conclusion.  While she is reasonably objective overall, there are places where she uses gaps in historical information (particularly in medieval times) to draw certain inferences that fit with her ideas and either ignores or glosses over other interpretations.<br />The final part of her book, the England/America comparison is the most opinionated.  Unfortunately, as she herself illustrates, the crime statistics of the two countries are like apples and oranges, which limits (although does not completely eliminate) the effectiveness of her arguments.<br />Overall, this book probably rates three-and-a-half stars: it is not great, but not bad either.  If you find this subject interesting as history, it may be a good read as long as you understand that it has a definite slant that you may or may not agree with.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a book on the subject of gun rights/gun control, this book may also be good; even though some of the arguments Malcolm raises are on the weak side, she does raise some thought-provoking issues.	2003-01-01

He has especially dedicated a number of his books to Greece and Rome.  In the Ancient Mediterranean, he broadens his field to the various civilizations around this body of water, particularly the ones on the eastern shores.<br />This book is only partly history.  It is also anthropology, as Grant examines what made up the culture of these various groups.  Since a lot of this is very ancient, there are not many individuals in much of this book; instead this is the story of various groups.  Only late in the book, when the focus moves to Greece and then Rome do we see individual historic figures; even then, Grant only glosses over them as he examines the societies.<br />Because of Grant's style, this can be slow reading at times, but there is a lot of good information here.  If you are interested in Greek and Roman history, this book is insufficient, but to get a context in which these great civilizations arouse, this book will work well.	2002-12-31

In his last novel, The Tin Collectors, he introduced his first series character, Shane Scully, who reappears in this book.<br />One day while driving on the freeway, Shane notices his best friend and fellow cop driving nearby.  The only problem is that his friend died three years ago by suicide.   Already in trouble with his superiors,  Shane knows that reopening this case based on a fleeting glance is dangerous, but he can't let things lie.<br />This premise, while not completely original, is at least executed well.  In fact, the first half of this novel is pretty exciting.  Unfortunately, the second half gets muddled with its complex plot involving the parallel market and the various shady characters involved in this market.  In addition, Cannell recycles some ideas from his first novel, The Plan, which also deals with childhood friends who wind up being on opposing sides.<br />The balance of good first half and bad second half is roughly equal, meriting this book an even three stars.  If you enjoy Cannell's other works, you should continue with this one, but otherwise, you might want to go elsewhere.	2002-12-31

At the time, it had been my first exposure to Philip K. Dick, and it easily motivated me to continue collecting his works, to the point where I have almost all his published stories, even the obscure ones.  At long last, I have revisited the work that started it all for me, and I was not disappointed.<br />The plot is almost Twilight-Zonish:  Jason Taverner, a major talk-show host suddenly wakes up to find all traces of his identity have disappeared and no one remembers him.  In the oppressive near-future world that he lives in, everything requires proof of identity and it doesn't take much to find yourself suddenly in a forced labor camp, so Jason has some real problems.  <br />Although this in itself doesn't sound all that original, it is in the execution that this story succeeds.  Dick goes beyond the lost identity story to show a nightmarish world that could follow from our own.  Quaintly, the story takes place in 1988, but just imagine it 14 years in the future (which was the timeframe based on when the story was written).  It would not be pleasant to live in this world.<br />Dick has two common themes running throughout most of his stories: what is it to be human, and what is reality?  This second theme is examined creatively in this work.  It is a definite loss that Dick died relatively young, before he was really known; now, he is more recognized, and his influence in science fiction is hard to understate.  This is a great book to be introduced to him with.	2002-12-29

Swagger, attempting to rescue a friend from this prison winds up in their clutches instead; despite the fact that Swagger is an exceptionally tough guy, Thebes is even tougher.<br />With the exception of just a couple of the principal heroes, there are few complex characters in here, but Hunter's strengths have always been with action and suspense and this one has tons of it.  This is one of Hunter's best, but even if you've never read any of his other stories, if you like this type of book, you will not be disappointed.	2002-12-27

Unfortunately, it is such a poor book that it is unlikely to convince anyone who isn't already on the pro-guns side.<br />The fundamental problem is that Waters is not a good writer.  His numerous stories get tiresome and redundant after a while, and even before then, he is not a great wordsmith.  There are also various spelling errors, but this admittedly may be a publisher's issue.<br />Beyond that, some of the arguments he uses are flaky at best.  Trying to prove a case by anecdote is very difficult, and his references to statistics are vague; he has great numbers, but rarely cites the sources.  Considering how often the gun rights people dismiss stories that defy their arguments, argument by anecdote is not really valid.<br />There are plenty of other problems.  When commenting on a particular judge, Waters has to throw in some digs about the judge's extramarital affairs as if it somehow makes his judicial decisions weaker; this sort of attack is known as fallacious by any debate student.  Further, there are cases where he distorts or alters facts, such as when he ascribes thoughts to particular individuals which he would have no way of knowing.<br />The world Waters describes has criminals lurking in every shadow.  Although he is very careful about not indicating the race of the criminals, he leaves enough hints to imply that they are predominantly black.  The victims, on the other hand (especially all the ones pictured) are predominantly white.  Thus he feeds into racial paranoia as well.<br />This is a bad book; not only will it not win any converts, but the gun rights people should be embarassed if this is as good as they can do to argue their side; in fact, it does nothing but make them look like rabid paranoids, an image I'm sure they don't want to have.	2002-12-27

Instead, the story focuses on Jane and Mark, a newly married couple with difficulties already developing in their relationship.<br />Although they are a couple, they are apart for most of the book, each involved in their own adventures.  Mark is lured into the service of the sinister organization NICE, where he is convinced to do small services that seem legitimate enough but are designed to further their agenda.  Meanwhile, Jane, plagued by clairvoyant visions, winds up joining with Dr. Ransom's group, which is out to save the world from NICE.  <br />Jane and Mark, physically separated and emotionally estranged, find themselves also on opposite sides in a cosmic conflict between good and evil.  Although this is a high-stakes battle, it is not overly supernatural, as the forces of good and evil operate with human agents/pawns.  And Lewis is not as interested in the adventure aspects of his story as using it as a vehicle for presenting certain theological (especially Christian) concepts in an entertaining manner.<br />The end result is a story that is a bit dry in spots but generally good.  This story is more sophisticated than the Narnia books, which are aimed towards a younger audience, but this trilogy is also not as much fun as the Chronicles of Narnia.  If you read this trilogy expecting Narnia, you may be disappointed, as you will if you are expecting what is normally considered science fiction.  On the other hand, if you want to read a thought-provoking fictional work, this may be to your liking.	2002-12-17

Nonetheless, Ken Follett has written a novel that makes this event suspenseful even though the reader knows what the end result will be.<br />Returning to the era in which Follett's best books take place, Jackdaws follows female operative Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet and her efforts to destroy an important German communications center.  She has a plan, and it requires a team of six women.  What she assembles is a motley crew of semi-amateurs, but it is the best she can get.<br />What makes this novel especially stand out is her adversary, the German Major Dieter Franck.  Franck is ruthless, but he is not evil and while a soldier and a German patriot, he is not fond of the Nazis.  Instead, he is out to stop what he considers to be terrorists: the Resistance members who threaten his people.<br />Considering current events, Dieter's motivations have certain parallels to what many believe about terrorism nowadays.  This adds an irony that probably goes beyond Follett even intended considering when this book must have been written and raises interesting questions about what terrorism is and what is appropriate in fighting it.  Which is not to say that Dieter is a good guy, but it does kind of ironically invert some things that are happening nowadays.<br />What is most important, however, is that this is another great book by Follett, an entertaining page-turner that does not let up on the suspense.  For a great WWII spy novel, Follett is hard to beat, and this book is another indication about why this is so.	2002-12-17

While comic books prosper and have gone well beyond the standard superhero format, the comic strip languishes, rarely allowing new and creative strips to break through, while \\"institutional\\" strips (those that have not been amusing for years but are institutions, such as Heathcliff or Crock) dominate the paper.<br />In this sense, this book is not very helpful; it is a relatively uncritical appreciation of the comics.  Nonetheless, it is an excellent book, a good summary of the major artists and developments in the comics since World War II.  All the big strips are here:  Garfield, Peanuts, Doonesbury, Calvin & Hobbes, the Far Side and many more, along with plenty of material from bygone eras.<br />This book is around 50% text and 50% comics, so there is plenty of fun stuff to read in either format.  For what it is - an appreciative history - it is fantastic.  The only flaw is that Walker ignores the comic strips of alternative newspapers, therefore neglecting such important works as Groening's Life in Hell (without which, there would be no Simpsons).<br />For anyone who has ever enjoyed the comics, this book is a great look at the field and a lot of fun.	2002-12-14

Lewis, best known for his fantasy series about Narnia - as well as his religious writings - tried his hand with science fiction with a trilogy of which Out of the Silent Planet is the first book.<br />Unfortunately, this is an imperfect effort, hardly on the same level as Narnia.  Somewhat a combination of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.G. Wells, this story follows the adventures of Ransom, a professor who is kidnaped and taken to another planet where he encounters various intelligent alien races and tries to stay ahead of his human adversaries.<br />This is not all as interesting as it sounds, primarily because Ransom is not a very interesting character and his main role seems to be as an observer.  He reacts more than he acts.  On the other hand, the aliens are somewhat intriguing, even if they are not as compelling as some other fictional aliens.<br />I don't want to come off too harsh; even if the book is a bit stiff, it isn't bad.  Also, it is only the first part of a trilogy, so this is not the complete story.  For Lewis fans, this might be a worthwhile book, as long as they don't expect Narnia; for science fiction fans, however, this will probably come a bit short.	2002-12-12

Burke, the anti-heroic main character is not a very pleasant person except in relation to the sleazy characters he must face.  In this story, he is hired by the woman Flood to find an elusive child-killer; along the way, he also must deal with other unsavory people.<br />While good, this book is not quite great.  In his first novel, Vachss shows some beginner's traits in his style, and his characters sometimes come off clown-like or cliched.  Also, this is an unpleasant world, and no character really has redeeming values; this may be compelling, but it can also be a turn-off if overdone.<br />In the end, I found this good enough that I will probably try another in the series, but I think I will wait a little while.  Too much of this dark universe at one time could be depressing.	2002-12-12

The worlds Barker creates are far more bizarre than anything you see in a standard horror novel; sometimes this works well, but other times, Barker's works are so strange that their very strangeness weakens his stories.  <br />In this case, however, Barker has done a fine job in creating his own version of a haunted house story.  Having recently read King and Straub's Black House, as well as other older classic haunted house stories such as the Shining (by King) or the Haunting (by Shirley Jackson), I am familiar with the conventions, but Barker is successful in twisting these conventions into new directions.<br />The haunted house in this case is located in an isolated canyon in Los Angeles.  A former party house for silent film stars, it has been seeemingly abandoned for years, until a modern movie star retreats there while recovering from plastic surgery.  The ghosts of the old stars are still here, drawn to a power within the house; also here is the house's owner, still alive and as young as when she was a silents star herself.<br />The forces in the house are not so much driven by evil as by lust.  This creates a sexual explicitness that may turn off some readers who are caught unaware, but it is essential in the context of this story.  The main character is not so much threatened with death (although this is always a possibility) as with being seduced by the powers within the house.<br />This is one of Barker's better efforts, a well-written work that - despite its length - I was able to finish in just a couple of reasonably idle days.  If there is a flaw in the book, I think it is in the last 100 or so pages, which serve more as an extended epilogue than a true part of the story.  Overall, this is a good book, however, and worth the effort for fans ofhorror or dark fantasy.	2002-12-07

Although many of his books are good to great, I have found that his most recent books in his other series (Bernie Rhodenbarr, Keller, Evan Tanner) have been a little weaker than in the past, this book - featuring his best character, Matthew Scudder - shows that Block still has it.<br />Scudder is a constantly evolving character.  In the earliest novels, he was a standard hard-boiled private eye, but soon he came to terms with his inner demons (in particular, his alcoholism) and learned how to reconstruct his life.  Now, he is sixty-two, not as inclined to get in dangerous situations, but still out to expose murderers.<br />This case deals with a couple who is killed in a home invasion robbery.  Soon, the killers are themselves dead in a murder-suicide, but Scudder, when drawn into the case, begins to think there is a third man.  Along with his investigation, he is involved with a subplot involving the death of his ex-wife and his relationship with his estranged sons.<br />Block is always at his best when writing about Scudder, and this case is no exception.  Admittedly, this book works best if you have read the others in the series, but even as a standalone, this is a good novel.	2002-12-07

In Nobody's Fool, he writes another excellent tale of small-town life, a setting he revisits in his masterpiece, Empire Falls.<br />The main character in Nobody's Fool is Donald Sullivan, known more commonly as Sully.  Sully is something of a free spirit, rarely thinking beyond the moment; now that he's sixty, he's feeling the effects of his short-sightedness; he has many friends but few real relationships, even with his son and his off-and-on again lover.  Indeed, the closest relationship he has is with his landlady.<br />It's hard to describe this novel in terms of plot, since this is more a book about characters than a regular story.  Russo is not interested in the standard beginning-middle-end structure of a novel; instead this book is almost pure middle.  Plenty happens, but as in real life, few things are neatly resolved.<br />Russo is a brilliant writer and makes all his characters multi-dimensional.  There are no good guys or bad guys here; even Sully, a likeable enough fellow, has some definite flaws.  The way all these characters interact - Sully, his landlady Miss Beryl, his friend/worshipper Rub, his foe/friend Carl and the dozen or so others - is what makes this book so much fun.  There is humor here, but this is not a comic novel; instead, it is a novel that does not fit well into any category.<br />For those whose tastes run beyond strict genre fiction, this is definitely a reccomended read.

As someone who has read hundreds of mysteries including a number of serial killer stories, I found this one to offer almost nothing new.<br />This is not an awful book, but it is also not good.  Most of the characters are not well-developed and in fact, seem rather cliched.  The two detectives are not very intriguing, and the romantic tension between the two of them is strictly standard.  Their supervisor is the same antagonistic bureaucrat we've all seen a dozen times before.<br />Another flaw is that despite over forty people dying in the course of the story, it often seems like there are only the two detectives working the case; only rarely do we get the feel that anyone else (beyond the standard forensics people) are really involved.  Compare this with one of John Sanford's Davenport novels (also about serial killers): in those books, you can tell Davenport is heading a team, not working by himself.<br />This is not the first book I've read by Lutz.  I've enjoyed his other books and know he's a good writer; not necessarily the best in the genre, but at least a good entertainer.  Even here, he is skilled enough to keep this book from being unreadable, but he is definitely better than this novel would indicate.	2002-12-03

In Bad News, the latest in his Dortmunder series, Westlake is as consistently great as always.<br />In this novel, the hapless burglar is recruited into doing some grave robbing for a group of con artists.  The con artists are certain that Dortmunder and his pal Kelp are just a couple of dumb crooks, but they are smart and pros...just very unlucky.  Soon Dortmunder and his usual gang are involved in a scam to get part ownership in a successful Indian casino, taking them out of their usual field and into the new area of grifting.<br />The irony that pervades this and the other Dortmunder novels is that Dortmunder winds up working harder as a thief and with less rewards than if he got a legitimate job.  The idea of honest work, however, never even crosses his mind.  In this book, once again, the simple jobs get ever more complicated and the payoffs are never as great as hoped.<br />This is a fun book and a funny one, a fast and entertaining read.  For those who like a good caper novel, this is a book to read, another delight from one of the masters.	2002-11-27

In Hostage, former hostage negotiator Jeff Talley must deal with three unlucky robbers holed up in a suburban house with a father and two kids.  Adding a twist, the father is a mob accountant, and he has some critical information (plus a bunch of cash) stashed within his home.<br />This is a novel of pure suspense, and I was not surprised to find it finished the same day I started it; it was not easy to put down.  Crais keeps things going at a rapid pace and the short chapters, rotating points-of-view and frequent plot twists add to the fever pitch.  With Talley tormented by his own inner demons in addition to mobsters who are manipulating him by holding his wife and daughter prisoner, he is a man whose options keep getting more and more limited and in the process, the story gets better and better.<br />I am not alone in longing to read the adventures of Elvis and Pike, but as long as Crais can continue to put out novels like this one, I am willing to wait a little longer.	2002-11-27
US	43083835	R3GKE5VR9FIZFR	0374123543	928235722	Churchill: A Biography	Books	3	19	25	N	N	Weak but detailed	Despite much of the praise lavished on this book by critics, Roy Jenkin's biography of Winston Churchill leaves much to be desired; there is just barely enough here to even rate it three stars.<br />The principal problem with this biography is the same thing that is its strength:  it is very detailed, but this is not necessarily good.  The part of Churchill's life that requires the most focus is his World War II years, but it takes over five hundred pages to get there, and in the meanwhile, we must read of his long and not always interesting rise to power.  By giving his whole adult life equal weight, Jenkins weakens his book (Imagine a biography of Lincoln that discussed his Congressional years as much as his Civil War years).<br />There are other flaws as well.  For all his detailed writing, Jenkins completely glosses over Churchill's childhood, which I feel would be interesting to know about.  Also, the book focuses almost completely on Churchill's political life and leaves the information about his family life to a minimal amount.  Jenkins also has a style of writing that can be excessively ornate, and he has a tendency to put himself in the book.<br />Jenkins emphasis on detail, from mundane finance issues to war topics, can also be a strength.  For a scholar, this can be a good thing, but for a less demanding reader, it can sometimes be a little tedious.  <br />Jenkins final flaw is that he fails to make Churchill seem like one of the great men of the 20th Century; instead he makes Churchill seem like a political opportunist and a spendthrift who got to his positition as much through endurance as ability.  In the end, the book is sufficiently flawed that I cannot recommend it to anyone outside of a dedicated student of British history.	2002-11-27

While this is not a bad book, it is also suffficiently flawed to not be a good one.<br />This novel is about Micky Bellsong, a woman with a past living with her aunt.  A girl who lives next door befriends her and tells her of her dangerous parents, a dangerously drugged mother and a homicidal step-father with an extremely Social-Darwinist approach to his murders.  Micky quickly becomes attached to the girl and is intent on rescuing her.<br />In a parallel story, a young boy is fleeing from the killers who have already murdered his mother.  It's obvious there is something special about this boy, considering the army of killers after him and the army of government agents who are in pursuit of both.<br />There is actually a third, basically needless plot line involving a private eye.  This character basically disappears for the middle third of the book (he doesn't appear for nearly 200 pages at one point) and his contribution to the overall story is minimal and could have been worked around easily.  <br />The fact that these plot lines are so separate is one of the big flaws in the story; the book feels like it is all over the place.  By the time they converge it is basically too late to care.  But even more importantly, this book is filled with weak characters.  Micky is not all that interesting and the villainous Preston Maddoc is not one of Koontz's more compelling psychotics.<br />As I have titled this review, I feel Koontz is just off his game in this book.  Readers who are introduced to him with this book may not get to know he is actually better than this.  While this novel has its moments and Koontz is skilled enough to entertain more often than he bores, this is just an average book.	2002-11-15

In this novel, he continues the trend.<br />The plot focuses on the kidnapping of the teenaged Megan Collier by former psychologist Aaron Matthews.  Matthews has used his skills from his career to become a master manipulator and now is out to ruin the life of Megan's father, Tate, a lawyer who in his own way is a master manipulator.<br />What follows is a chess game between Tate and Aaron, with Aaron several moves ahead and Tate unaware of who he's &quot;playing&quot; against even as he continues to lose the pieces that he needs to win.  Aaron is a formidable villain, even if his skills do seem unbelievably good at times.  Tate, who must come to terms with his own bad parenting even as he seeks his daughter, makes a good opponent for Aaron.<br />As stated in the title of this review, this is a worthwhile thriller and can be enjoyed by most fans of suspense fiction.  Deaver keeps the story moving and if there are little flaws here or there, they are not enough to keep this book from being good entertainment.	2002-11-12

Not one of these books is less than superb, and this one fits in well in the series.<br />As indicated on the cover, this book is the volume that covers the Civil War era.  McPherson, however, does not start with Fort Sumter.  Instead, he spends around a quarter of the book looking at the events that led to the war; only after an in-depth review of items such as the Great Compromise of 1850 and the Dred Scott decision does the book get into the actual war.<br />McPherson is pretty objective in his writing.  He may lean a little towards the North, but I believe that has much to do with the distastefulness of the South's principal cause, the protection of slavery as an institution.  And if there is a hero in McPherson's history, it must be Lincoln, whose strong leadership - as well as his gifted use of language - guided the North to victory and led to the downfall of slavery.  Had he not been assassinated, the Reconstruction Era (not covered in this book) may have been quite different.<br />There have been thousands of books written on the Civil War; some are comprehensive while some cover a single battle or individual.  I have read only a few, but I agree with the consensus opinion: this is the best single volume work on this period.  But I could state that about any volume in this series, which is why I look forward to the next one coming out, whenever that might be.	2002-11-10
US	43083835	RL2U48XO3EGQG	0451206711	471003961	Orchid Blues (Holly Barker)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Good entertainment	In Orchid Blues, Stuart Woods brings back Holly Barker, the small-town police chief initially featured in Orchid Beach.  As with the first book - and, in fact, most of his books - Woods has written a lightly entertaining book, the type of book that is often referred to as a beach read.  It may not be deep, but it is a fast, fun read.<br />For Woods fans, this book is kind of a meeting place for characters from his other books.  Stone Barrington has a guest appearance that is rather needless; there is no real reason why his role couldn't have been filled by some other character; at least he doesn't sleep with Holly, which makes her the first beautiful woman he hasn't slept with within a couple chapters of meeting.  Will Lee, Woods other series character, is referred to although he does not appear.  Finally, the neo-Nazi group, the Elect, makes another appearance with their usually plans to overthrow the government.<br />Although I would guess this is technically a Holly Barker novel, it actually focuses more on her father, Ham, who is recruited to infiltrate the Elect, who may be responsible for the death of Holly's fiance.  Ham is an interesting if a little too perfect, and the villains he contends with are a bit one-dimensional, even if they are reasonably clever.  Holly's role tends to be more behind-the-scenes.<br />Woods doesn't dispose of his series characters easily, and Holly and Ham will be back in Blood Orchid, which just came out in hardcover.  My guess is that Stone will be back and that he and Holly will eventually hook up and the two series will converge.  This book can stand alone, however, so it will be good for both Woods fans and those who just want some light entertainment.  You may not feel that you have read a classic, but you will have fun.	2002-11-04

Now, I have finally read the book and in certain ways was surprised at how things are different.<br />For the most part, the book and the movie are very similar, which isn't surprising since William Goldman adapted his own book for the movie.  In that sensee, there are no real shocks; even the movie's framing story of a grandfather reading the book to his sick grandson has its origins in the book.<br />The book offers more, however, than just the movie on paper.  Goldman has also created a whole fictitious history of his work and even included the beginning of a sequel.  The history and his occasional asides are pretty clever; the sequel - Buttercup's Baby - is actually a bit of a disappointment, with stylistic differences from the main story that was written over two decades earlier.<br />Overall, this is a great book, but fans of the movie should be cautioned; this book is more cynical than the movie.  Buttercup, in particular, is both shallower and dumber than in the film and the true love that she shares with Westley is also much shallower than in the movie.  That doesn't subtract from the quality of the novel, but the irony in the book is much more pronounced and it could disappoint those expecting essentially a novelization of the film.	2002-11-02
US	43083835	RIZIFDOMZCMZ8	0393307050	680723399	Master and Commander	Books	3	8	14	N	Y	Not for land-lubbers	I had heard a lot of good thing about O'Brian and his series of naval adventures, so on a whim, I decided to check him out, and appropriately, to start at book one.  What I found was a book that has a lot to recommend it, but not one that appeals to my particular tastes.<br />Master and Commander is an episodic tale that introduces Captain Jack Aubrey and the various people in his life.  Aubrey, the main character, is not an easy person to like: he is a borderline mercenary and pirate, more ambitious than patriotic and not overly bright outside of naval matters.  I suppose he matures as the series goes on, but I don't know if I'll stick around to find out.<br />The essential flaw in the book is its reliance on naval terminology.  While this adds an important level of verisimilitude, it also makes the story more inaccessible to those unfamiliar with these concepts.  There is some explaining, but a lot is left for the reader to figure out.<br />On the plus side, O'Brian does tell a good overall story, both simultaneously old-fashioned in style and modern in the things he depicts.  Nonetheless, I cannot give this work more than three stars, as his weaknesses offset his strengths.  For fans of naval adventure, I am sure that this story would rate higher, but for others, this book is likely to try your patience.	2002-11-02

This one is a robust climb up a hill, fulfilling, but not necessarily easy.  Franzen has written a portrait of one particular dysfunctional family as its patriarch's health is declining.<br />The challenge is that this is a novel where not a lot goes on.  The forward progression of the story is slow, as Franzen meanders through the chronology of the main characters.  The plot itself is both minimal and simple:  The mother in the family is trying to get her three grown children to come home for one last Christmas together.  But there is a lot more than that.<br />After a brief prologue, the story is divided into five roughly equal segments of around one hundred pages each.  Three of the segments follow each of the children, one follows the parents and the final one puts them all together.  Each of these five principal characters is a flawed individual and not always very sympathetic; most of the misfortunes they suffer are the result of their own selfish actions.  Nonetheless, each character is intriguing in his or her own way.<br />This book has gotten a lot of praise, and it certainly has merits.  Franzen is an adept writer and his prose is clear and often humorous.  He is able to make his rather minimal story interesting and readable.  On the other hand, I'm still not sure what the point of the book was.  In serious literature (which I think this novel aspires to be), there should be something a bit more thought provoking than what is delivered.  Overall, I rate this book as very good but not great; an entertaining read for those willing to climb literary mountains.	2002-11-02

After reading two previous books in the series - Freedom from Fear and Grand Expectations - I knew that the Oxford History of the United States was a worthwhile read.  The Glorious Cause continues the tradition of great books in the series.<br />Middlekauff's book covers the era from 1763 to 1789, essentially the time of the first real problems with England through the ratification of the Constitution.  The first couple hundred pages move a little slowly, as the material isn't quite as interesting:  there is a lot about the workings of the British government and various tax laws.  After that, however, things pick up considerably and the remaining two-thirds of the book are excellent.<br />In fact, this may be the best single volume book on the Revolutionary Era.  My only wish is that Middlekauff dedicated a little bit of space to some of the more legendary characters of the era such as Nathan Hale or Betsy Ross, neither of whom are even referred to; while I realize that the stories of these people are at least partially fictitious, I think they should be put into context.<br />That is, however, a minor gripe.  Overall, this is a great book and for anyone who wants to learn about this era, a must-read.	2002-10-26

Some will say that Joyce's Ulysses is the greatest novel of the 20th century; by some standards, that may be so, but it is also a rather unaccessible work.  Tolkien, on the other hand may be enjoyed on many levels; that is why he can be liked by pre-teens and adults equally.  Certainly, there are few modern authors who have had such a long-standing avid following as J.R.R. Tolkien.  With essentially only two major works - The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings - Tolkien has become a favorite of many.  Is he deserving of such popularity?  This book argues yes.<br />Many with the academic credentials of Shippey would not deign to suggest that Tolkien's works are more than trivial fantasy.  That Shippey does not so easily dismiss these books adds credibility to his arguments.  Shippey breaks down what would qualify an author as Author of the Century - such things as ability, popularity and influence - and shows why Tolkien fits well into this niche.<br />Shippey examines the key four books of Tolkien's as well as his more minor works.  While doing so, he points out fascinating facts and concepts, although sometimes, I think he overanalyzes the material.  There is a risk in reading a book like this:  just as knowing a magician's secrets may be useful, it destroys the magic of the act itself.  Similarly, Shippey runs the risk of revealing all the magic that makes Tolkien great, but fortunately, he doesn't.  <br />Perhaps it is because Tolkien does not operate by sleight-of-hand but uses a subtler, more supernatural talent that cannot be fully understood...but if he is to be Author of the Century, would we expect any less?  For any serious Tolkien fan, this book is a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	2002-10-26

In particular, his previous novel, The Third Option, concluded with major issues unresolved; now, in this book, Senator Hank Clark, a methodical behind-the-scenes sort of villain is up to additional mechanations to satisfy his desire for the Presidency.<br />On the side of the good guys are Irene Kennedy, the President's nominee for the directorship of the CIA and assassin/super-soldier Mitch Rapp.  They are out to find out who were the conspirators from the Third Option and at the same time counteract a nuclear threat from Iraq.  Add to this complications in Rapp's love life and there is a lot going on.<br />Flynn writes a generally good suspenseful novel, but there are imperfections, especially with pacing.  It takes a while for any real action to occur, and then the concluding acts just zip on by; the book needs a faster start and a slower finish.  Nonetheless, this should satisfy Flynn's fans and spy novel fans in general.	2002-10-26

Now, at long last, he has written another Myth book, and I feel I could have waited after all.<br />This story, which takes place after book three in the series has Skeeve and Aahz seeking a cow that delivers golden milk.  Of course, it is not that easy to get to said cow.  It is a combination fantasy/western/vampire story, and it doesn't really work.  The plot is okay, but the writing is weak, the characters are shallow and worst of all, it just isn't funny.<br />I have enough loyalty to the series not to ditch it based off of one bad book, but this is not a good sign for Asprin's return.  This book is for Myth fans only...all others should look elsewhere for their entertainment.	2002-10-15

The thing you're not sure of, however, is how well Ludlum will execute this standard formula.<br />In this case, Ludlum does an above-average job in telling the story of Ben Hartman, a disillusioned businessman who is unexpectedly a target of assassins and framed for crimes he didn't commit.  Out of his league initially, Hartman eventually acquires the experience and intelligence to battle his mysterious foes.<br />I won't reveal what the purpose of the Sigma conspiracy is, but it is very reminiscent of a science fiction classic by Norman Spinrad called Bug Jack Barron.  If you haven't read this book, this will mean nothing; if you have, you will probably catch on to the big secret much earlier.<br />This is not a perfect book; Ludlum is not that great a writer.  On the other hand, for Ludlum fans, this will enjoyable and for other suspense fans, this will be a decent diversion.	2002-10-15

The Alex Delaware series used to be good, which keeps me coming back hoping it would be good again.  This is still not happening.<br />All the recent Delaware novels have followed the same pattern.  Delaware is presented with a mystery, he goes from person to person talking to them with a minimal amount of action, and finally there is a scene which presents some danger to Delaware as the murderer is revealed.  In this case, Delaware doesn't really even solve the mystery but instead stumbles onto the killer, a minor character who physically appears in less than ten pages before the end.<br />The big flaw is that Delaware has become a non-character, more of an observer than an actual personality.  Even Kellerman's attempts to create a little personal tension in Delaware's love life fail because Robin is also a non-character.  She basically has had walk-on roles in the past few books, and here her appearance isn't much greater (she hardly appears at all in the first half of the book).<br />Kellerman still has talent, as evidenced in Billy Straight, but here he fails.  I suppose he could revamp Alex, but that may actually be rather jarring.  It would probably be better to start a new series altogether.  Kellerman has enough marketability that he could easily do this.  In the meanwhile, if you must read a Kellerman book, read one of his wife's instead:  her series is actually getting better with time.	2002-10-09

With his historical-action novels of Africa, he does for that continent what James Clavell did for Asia.<br />In Warlock, Smith repeats a common formula for his stories; a young heir to a powerful position is forced by evil villains to fight for what is rightfully his.  The young man has an old mentor whose wisdom is essential.  Unusual for Smith, there is more of a focus on the mentor character, Taita, the warlock of the title.<br />Although Smith usually focuses more on fact, in this case he has written a fantasy.  The gods of Egypt and Babylon are real and participate indirectly in events; Taita and others have actual magical powers.  This in itself makes the book a definite departure for Smith.<br />It is not a perfect book; Smith's writing in some parts, especially love and sex scenes is a bit awkward.  Overall, however, Smith has written a good soap opera in ancient Egypt...not a profound book but an entertaining one.  Smith promises a fun read and he delivers.	2002-10-09

Boot's book looks at the many other little wars we have been involved in and their impact on both our history and our military thinking.<br />The first thing that must be done in a book like this is define what a small war is.  Boot defines it as an undeclared war basically done at the insistence of the President, fought usually in an atypical field of battle and usually with a goal other than unconditional surrender of the enemy.  Duration or scale is not a factor; by Boot's definition, the Vietnam War was a small war and the much shorter Gulf War was a big war.<br />Going from the battles against the Barbary pirates to Bosnia, Boot selects some of the U.S.'s more significant minor wars and discusses their causes and resolutions.  His tone is sometimes critical of American action, but generally depicts the U.S. in a better light than other countries engaged in these (often) imperialistic efforts.  Boot is definitely not an isolationist: the final part of the book deals with his argument that these wars are necessary and that America is damaged more from reluctance to fight than by fighting.<br />This is an excellent book.  For a somewhat alternative look at U.S. history, this fits the bill.  Even if you disagree with his interventionist viewpoint, there is still enough valuable historical material here to be a worthwhile (and enjoyable) read.	2002-10-04

Last Man Standing fits right in with this trend.<br />In this novel, Web London, a member of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) is the sole survivor of a raid gone terribly wrong.  Guilt-ridden, he is driven to find the perpetrator's of this crime.  There are links to drug dealers and white supremacists and more, but Web does intrepidly figure things out.<br />While written capably enough to be a fast and generally pleasant read, there is little that stands out about this novel.  The plot is sometimes overly complex, with the final conspiracy almost ludicrous in its detail.  Also, after the initial botched raid, there is little in the way of real action until the second half of the book.<br />There are also too many larger-than-life characters.  This fault comes from the fact that Web himself is so physically superior that his adversaries need to be even more so.  Fortunately, Baldacci has the skill to overcome these weaknesses.<br />This is a slightly above-average book, just under three-and-a-half stars.

What I found was a flawed but generally good spy novel that is one of the better of its type, though not one of the best.<br />A semi-historical novel that follows the CIA from its inception to the end of the Cold War, The Company focuses on three particular characters - Ebby, Jack and Leo - as they rise in the ranks and get involved with major Cold War events such as the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and the Bay of Pigs.  There is not much of a plot as Littell is more interested in writing episodic history than telling a single story.  The one true plot string deals with a mole within the CIA known as SASHA who foils various company efforts.<br />Littell is good with suspense and creates likable (or villainous) enough characters, but he is not perfect.  He has a tendency to repeat himself and introduces elements into the story that go nowhere; in particular, a minor character known as the Calabrian contributes little to the book and is, in fact, unneeded.<br />Overall, however, this is a good book and fans of the more realistic spy novels (such as Follett or Deighton as opposed to Ludlum or Fleming) will find this a pleasant, worthwhile read.	2002-09-26
US	43083835	R561INKYBDYI1	0345441036	237509158	Black House	Books	3	2	4	N	N	The whole is not greater than the parts	Stephen King is the number one writer of horror today, as he has been for over two decades; Peter Straub is probably number five or so.  Combining these two talents should be a good thing - and at one time, with the Talisman, it was - but in this case, the pair have come up with a book that is more flawed than most of their standalone material.  <br />In this novel, Jack Sawyer, the hero of the Talisman who is now grown up, is a retired homicide detective living the peaceful life outside a small Wisconsin town.  This peace is interrupted by the presence of a particularly sadistic child killer.  This is not a murder mystery however:  the killer is revealed relatively early to the reader.  The dangers lie in the supernatural forces that the killer has allied himself with that threaten not only the town but the whole world.<br />Although there are distinct bits of Straub in the novel, this is actually a King novel.  Except for the use of present tense (unusual in King's books), this reads a lot like most of King's books.  Also, this story fits into a mythology that King has already developed and uses in the Dark Tower books and Hearts in Atlantis (among others).  Although not as bad as Dreamcatcher (one of the lower points in King's books), this novel is a mix of the very interesting and stretches of tediousness.<br />I doubt I will discourage many from reading this book, and certainly for many horror and fantasy fans, there is a lot of good stuff here.  For people expecting something of the same high-quality of the Talisman, however, there may be at least a bit of disappointment.	2002-09-11

This, while not his best, still shows off his strengths.  <br />Unlike some of his recent books that are dedicated primarily to debunking various paranormal events, this book is mostly a collection of reviews of various books and authors.  There is also some amusing diversions such as a chapter filled with word play.<br />For an introduction to Gardner, this may not be the best book since it doesn't focus on either debunking or mathematical recreations, which is where he does his best work.  For Gardner fans, however, this should not be a disappointment.	2002-09-06

Keyssar shows that this democratic nature took a long time to develop and that the concept of &quot;universal&quot; suffrage is really very recent.<br />Supported by a lot of information (the supplementary materials make up around 25% of the book), Keyssar shows that American history is made up of lots of incidents of people trying to gain voting rights, including women, various ethnic groups, men without property and eighteen year olds.  The progression to universal suffrage was neither smooth nor always forward: there were numerous cases when voting rights were taken away from a group.<br />Although this book is very informative and filled with important material, the subject of voting rights is not always very exciting.  Keyssar does a good job overall - and keeps reasonably objective in the process - but there are times when this can be a slow read.  Nonetheless, for those interested in distinguishing between the myths and truths of American history, this is a worthwhile read.	2002-09-05

The Parker novels are a series of books by Richard Stark (Donald Westlake) featuring a tough and stoic thief.  In Hardcase, Simmons features a tough and stoic ex-private eye named Kurtz.  Even the dedication of the book makes it clear who's steps Simmons is following in.<br />The novel itself is a fast and fun read with the same cool attitude that Stark/Westlake has perfected.  Kurtz, out of prison after a term for killing his lover's murderer, gets mixed up with the Buffalo mob in his attempt to get back on his feet.  Kurtz is not a nice guy, but the people he opposes are far more unpleasant.<br />For Simmons, an accomplished writer of some rather sophisticated books (such as the Hyperion books), this novel must be a quick diversion.  While fun, this book is also not very original and Kurtz sometimes pales next to Parker (I imagine if the two met, it would not go well for Kurtz).  Nevertheless, it is good enough that I will continue to read these books, of which there will be at least one more.	2002-09-05

This, my second Russo book, while not quite the same caliber of Empire Falls, is still a very good book.<br />Straight Man is the story of William Henry Devereaux, an English professor plagued with political maneuvering at the college he works at, where budget cuts threaten various jobs.  Meanwhile, he is suffering from physical ailments and doubts about the happiness of his wife and daughter.  It could be typical mid-life crisis stuff, but Russo's humor and writing ability make the story stand out.<br />There can be a couple different messages you can get out of this book.  The one that stands out for me is that education does not remove pettiness or irrationality; Devereaux and his coworkers may have a lot of knowledge, but it doesn't stop them from acting in less-than-high-minded manners.  Not that lack of education is much better, as depicted by other characters, including Devereaux's daughter and father-in-law.  It's just that education, by itself, is not enough to make someone a good person or, sometimes, even a competent one.  <br />This is a good book which reminds me a lot of Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys as they cover similar ground, but the emphasis here is more on humor.  For almost any fiction reader, this is a good book to read.	2002-08-27

Wills explores the seeming contradictions between the brilliant Madison responsible for the Constitution and Bill of Rights and the less-than-impressive president.<br />Wills shows that there is less of a contradiction than there seems to be.  The flaws that hurt Madison as a president were actually around much earlier, especially his inability to function well as an executive.  Madison was much more a behind-the-scenes person, quite adept in committees or legislative situations, but not as able outside them.<br />As a biography, this book is rather short and sparse, but by focusing on one portion of Madison's life - the portion which he does not receive great acclaim for - Wills is still able to provide a lot of detail as he analyzes and explains the fourth presidency.	2002-08-26

In this book, he comes off overly abrasive at times and rambling at other times.  Nonetheless, this book gets the full five stars because of the message in the book is so important.<br />What is the message?  Put in Randi-like terms, it is that psychics are frauds.  The book is a three hundred page demonstration that there are no legitimate psychics, and everyone who alleges to be one is quickly shown to be a faker.  Randi delves into other hoaxes as well, including UFO-sightings, the Bermuda Triangle and fairies.<br />Randi lacks the skill of a Carl Sagan or Martin Gardener (to name two others who do similar debunkings), but the service he provides by this book cannot be overlooked.  Too many people buy into these hoaxes and the harm that results is often too real; one example is a person who is conned by a psychic surgeon and hence winds up neglecting necessary medical treatment.<br />So, although on writing merits alone, this book would get three stars, Randi gets two bonus stars because of the subject matter he covers.  This book is a must-read for almost everyone:  for skeptics, so they can spread the word about these hoaxes and for believers in psychic powers, so they can learn they are being conned (although this second group may not be converted by this single book).	2002-08-23

Freedman departs from his usual field of legal thriller and his usual setting of California to tell this story of Fritz Tullis, the black sheep of a prosperous Maryland family, and the murder he witnesses.<br />Tullis, a former history professor forced to resign in disgrace, has carved out a minimalist existence in the woods on his mother's estate.  He spends his days bird-watching, and on one expedition, he sees (and photographs) a murder on a neighbor's land.  Touchy about breaking out of his isolation, Tullis is initially reluctant to report a crime that doesn't seem to impact him.  The novel deals with Tullis's decision to quietly investigate the crime to see if he should actually report it to the authorities.  Along the way, he begins to undergo a healing process that can restore his life.  <br />As is typical with Freedman, this book is written in the first person and, unusually, in the present tense.  The departures from his usual story and setting work okay, but he is usually stronger on his more familiar ground.  There is very little that is wrong with this story, but it is not exceptional enough to merit five stars.  Nonetheless, it is a fast and entertaining read for those who like mysteries.	2002-08-21

In such a book, there are oppressors (often white males) and oppressed (usually women and non-whites).  Johnson supports this thesis with numerous tales of robbery and murder, which may all be true, but also reflect a political agenda that she is trying to promote.  This removes any real objectivity from her book.<br />The main problem with this book, however, is it is not very well-organized.  Johnson has filled the book with some good (and some not-so-good) anecdotes, but there is not all that much joining these stories together.  The result is a sometimes informative but usually rambling work.  In the end, I felt like I hadn't learned very much about this era other than a few tales that needed a better context.	2002-08-20

What I found with Jupiter is that Bova is a decent author, well-deserving of his longetivity in the genre.<br />Bova's late 21st Century Earth is an unpleasant place dominated by the New Morality, a futuristic spin-off of the Moral Majority.  Protagonist Grant Archer is a religious man who is used as a pawn of the New Morality in its efforts to spy on the Jovian explorers.  Archer is sent to a space station above Jupiter and quickly learns there are mysterious goings-on, and as the story develops, he gets more and more involved with these happenings himself, until finally he must go on a high-risk exploration of the big planet itself.<br />I say that this novel is in the classic style of science fiction because it is reminiscent of such sci-fi giants as Asimov and Clarke.  Science and scientific exploration are the most important things, and plot and character are next on the list.  Nonetheless, although his characters are not all that well developed, they are not one-dimensional.  Archer, in particular, is a conflicted individual, torn between the New Morality who he often agrees with and offers his only chance to go home to his wife and his own feelings that the Jovian explorers are doing a necessary thing.<br />I recommend this book for fans of hard science fiction, in particular, fans of classic hard science fiction.  This book fits well into this genre and will not disappoint those readers.	2002-08-16

The hangings were public events that were widely attended by men, women and children.  As prison provided an alternative punishment, execution began to be used only for the most serious crimes, and eventually began to be done in a more private forum and by newer, more \\"humane\\" methods.<br />Banner covers all these issues well and with such an objective approach it is difficult to even see what side of the issue he is on.  That's what helps make this book so great:  with Banner's balanced approach, you never get the feeling he is pushing either a pro- or anti-death penalty agenda.  <br />Balance by itself would not be enough, but Banner also is a good writer and this book is a fascinating read.  Whether you are for the death penalty or against it, you should read this book.  It probably won't change your mind, but it will give you much more insight as to why we use the death penalty like we do.	2002-08-15

In this book - a semi-sequel to Wild Justice, as the two books share some characters - a young lawyer gets entangled in a high-stakes lawsuit over a medication that may or may not cause birth defects.  People start getting murdered and the lawyer winds up as a suspect.<br />The book has a good amount of suspense and plot twists, but it suffers from a weak main character who bounces from situation to situation without taking any real action of his own.  He is a nice enough guy, but he rarely takes any initiative.<br />For Margolin fans, this novel is good, but not great.  People who are newer to the genre might be more entertained, but others will find that this story is nothing special.	2002-08-15

Books	4	17	21	N	N	Brief but insightful	Dahl's book is actually more of an extended essay on the Constitution and the conflicts it has with modern concepts of democracy.  In particular, Dahl focuses on such elements of the Constitution as senate representation and the electoral college, both of which provide representation on a basis other than that of population.<br />These &quot;flaws&quot; in the Constitution are nothing new.  Dahl's more insightful work is where he compares the United States to other, similar democracies and sees how our Constitution compares with theirs.<br />This is a fast read, but that's as much a result of the brevity of the book as its writing.  There are items Dahl could have developed more:  in particular, the difficulty of amendment ratification fits perfectly into his book, but he really only mentions it as a stumbling block to Constitutional reform, not as another anti-democratic element of the document.<br />Despite its flaws, this book succeeds in its chief goal, which is to look at the Constitution in a realistic manner, without the glorification that so many people give it.  It may provide more questions than answers, but these are good questions that need to be asked.	2002-08-12

For those who view their religion on a more dogmatic level, this book can provide some uncomfortable insights, especially the idea that God - or humanity's view of God - has changed over time, even within a particular faith.<br />Armstrong definitely knows her material, sometimes too well for easy reading.  This book is filled with a lot of historical and theological detail and cannot be read lightly if one is to grasp all that is contained within.  Although generally readable, the subject matter makes for slow going at times, and Armstrong does get a bit pedantic at times.  Also, while generally objective, she does editorialize every now and then, which interferes with her presentation of the subject.<br />Overall, this is a good book, with some stylistic flaws but filled with plenty of insight into religious history.  For those who want to learn more about the development of theology, this is a recommended read.	2002-08-09

For the two non-victims, there is always doubt that they could have done more...for the victim, although he gets away, he bears emotional scars that never completely go away.<br />Twenty-five years later, they are in their mid-thirties and they are all linked to a crime:  one is the father of the victim, another is investigating the crime and the third appears to be the prime suspect.  The story alternates between the three characters (and some related characters) as the crime and subsequent mystery unfold.<br />Although a whodunit, this book goes beyond the mystery to examine how the events of childhood - the type of parents you have, the economic class you fit into and the random crimes that afflict us all - shape our adult lives and are difficult to escape.  The riddle of who the killer is serves as the vehicle to look at these characters and try and understand their lives.<br />Lehane once again shows he is one of the top writers in the mystery field.  His writing is sharp and often intense and his characters are compelling.  Lehane has the talent to go beyond the genre, however, and this will be a good read for anyone who enjoys fiction, not just mystery fans.	2002-08-08

In fact, the most well-known fact about Cleveland is that he is the only president to serve non-consecutive terms; the more trivia-minded may also know that the Baby Ruth candy bar was named after his daughter.<br />This biography shows Cleveland as a man of great integrity who was motivated more by principle than by partisanship.  Cleveland comes off as a generally likeable person but not a very imaginative or visionary president.  This could explain his relatively minor place in American history.<br />Jeffers has written a generally admiring biography but does not neglect Cleveland's flaws.  At times, his writing comes off a little too casual, such as when he refers to Cleveland constantly as &quot;Grover,&quot; which seems out of place in a serious biography.  Nonetheless, there are few enough biographies of Cleveland available, and this one is good enough to introduce a student of American history to this little-known president.	2002-08-07

Although not perfect, this is a very good work filled with humor and cleverness.<br />Although sparse in story, this book makes up for it with satirical insights.  The main character heads a department of Hitler Studies and has a hoard of past and present spouses and children passing through his life.  Strange chemical spills have effects that could kill if old age doesn't do the job first.  Real disasters are used to practice for simulated ones.  In short, White Noise portrays an absurd world that is close to our own.<br />For a person who has never read DeLillo, this is a good introduction as it is clearer than some of his other works.  There is the possibility of letdown with his other books, but that should not prevent you from enjoying this work.	2002-07-31

It was a disappointment, therefore, to find that this novel was not up to the standard of his usual works.<br />The outstanding flaw with this story is its one dimensional villains, a bunch of mobsters who are straight out of some cheesy Mafia movie.  The most interesting thing about lead criminal Owney Maddox is that he occasionally affects an English accent.  Add to the cliched mobsters some cliched hillbilly muscle and the story has some real problems.<br />Earl Swagger is an interesting enough character, although in certain ways a little too perfect.  Yes, he can be a drunk and a bad husband, but in a fight, he is so utterly superior that it reduces some of the suspense.  <br />Hunter is a great writer (usually) and he can even make this weaker effort exciting at times.  The second half of this book in particular has some good moments.  Nonetheless, this book would not be a good introduction to Hunter's works, and I cannot recommend it to anyone other than his usual fans.	2002-07-30

The Boys of Summer deals with one man's different perceptions of baseball players over time, as they change from demigods to mere mortals.<br />The book starts with Kahn's recollections of childhood, when the Brooklyn Dodgers were heroes.  As he reaches adulthood, he is lucky enough to get an opportunity to report on his favorite team, and he learns that these players are more flawed than they seem at a distance.  In the second half of the book, it is years later, and Kahn sees what retirement has done to the players.<br />There was a time that baseball was the dominant sport in the U.S., and there is something sad in seeing these idols - worshipped by kids and adults alike - forced into mundane existences by age.  There is more:  a lot of insights into racism and various players reactions to integration in baseball.<br />This is a great book about the Boys of Summer, those Brooklyn Dodgers who played great ball from 1947 to 1957.  For fans of baseball, this book is a must-read.	2002-07-29

It is a story with humor and tragedy and ideas.<br />The story deals with a Jesuit-supported mission to a nearby star system where it appears life exists.  With deep pockets and singlemindedness, the Jesuits are able to outrace the different governments and encounter the aliens first.  The eight who go to this planet are four Jesuits (including main character, Emilio Sandoz) and four laypeople including an engineer, a doctor and an astronomer.<br />That most of these characters will die is revealed very early on: the book switches back and forth between the story of the group's trip to the planet and the investigation into the sole survivor's story.  Even though they take place years apart, the two plot lines converge on the tragic events that would leave only one man living in a state of physical and emotional wreckage.<br />This is good fiction, but only okay science fiction.  Russell uses the devices of science fiction such as space travel and aliens, but the worlds of 2019 and 2060 are essentially the same as our own.  When Sandoz returns after a forty year absence, it seems like the main thing he missed were the baseball scores.  This weakness is likely to disappoint science fiction fans, but overall, this is a good book.	2002-07-25

In its own way, however, i is quite real and an essential part of modern mathematics and the sciences; literally and figuratively, it adds another dimension to the world of math.<br />Nahin's book on the subject conveys the importance of i, but unfortunately does it in a tedious manner.  He has written a book dense with proofs and equations, but rather lacking in history or personality.  There is some material in here that of interest to all, but overall, I feel that this book is only for the serious mathematician.  Despite his statement to the contrary, this requires more than a high school level of education to understand.<br />Interestingly, I found that this was the second book I'd read by Nahin; the first one was on time travel.  What I remembered about this first book was that the author took an interesting subject and ran it into the ground; he does a similar thing here.  While there is enough in An Imaginary Tale to be of interest to a mathematician, and while it does convey the importance of i, this book will remain inaccessible to readers who just want to be introduced to this interestinginly complex number.	2002-07-24

Tyler and supporting character Nell Priest are likeable enough and the problems they face are formidable.  There is, in fact, little that is wrong with this book, except that Tyler and Priest are not as interesting as his series characters of Boldt and Matthews.<br />As a light, fast and fun read, this book fits the bill, but for the best of Pearson, you need to look elsewhere.	2002-07-23

Herbert Hoover, in his biography, is a man without flaws and probably the greatest man who ever lived.  This bias is evident on almost every page and makes for bad writing.<br />Herbert Hoover may be underrated in history, or have a worse reputation than he deserves, but he is not as great as Lyons portrays him.  By deifying Hoover, Lyons actually comes off somewhat like a defense lawyer trying to canonize a client.  Throught the book, Lyons distorts the truth and avoids certain facts if they could possibly show Hoover in an unfavorable light.<br />In addition to bad writing, this book doesn't even contain an index and the few photos are without captions or context.  I've read many historical biographies before, and this is one of the worst.  If you are interested in Herbert Hoover, skip this book; they may be hard-to-find, but there are more objective books out there.	2002-07-19

While his Alex Delaware series is getting weaker and weaker, her series featuring Peter and Rina Decker is actually getting better.  On the quality scale, the two have reversed positions over the years and she is now the Kellerman to read.<br />This story starts relatively slowly with an act of anti-Semitic vandalism.  The culprit is caught reasonably quickly, but it also triggers a series of events that leaves several people dead.  <br />While the mystery is okay enough, the subplot involving Peter and his stepson is actually better; in fact, the family is more interesting overall than Peter's coworker cops.  This is not a series where the characters remain static; instead, they definitely evolve over time.  Even Peter and Rina have their tense moments, but the solidness of their marriage is also evident.<br />It is not a perfect novel.  While Faye Kellerman is a good author, she can improve still.  My biggest gripe, however, actually has to do with the marketing of these books.  Rina and Peter have been married for over seven years in book time and at least half a dozen novels; I think she should be referred to as Rina Decker, not Rina Lazarus; she hasn't used that name for a long time and I don't think it is essential to use it on the book covers.	2002-07-16
US	43083835	R1TYFNJOKVU4V2	0345449347	990748107	The Fourth Hand	Books	4	1	2	N	N	More good Irving	After having read so many harsh reviews of this book, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a really good novel.  While not Irving's best (my personal favorites are Garp, Owen Meany and A Widow for One Year), this is nonetheless a well-written and fun book.<br />Lighter in tone than most of his novels, this story focuses on the characters involved in a hand transplant, particularly the recipient and the donor's widow.  A subplot in the first part of the book involves the hand surgeon and the comic events in his own life.  Finally, there is the donor himself, who only appears on a few pages, but whose presence, both physically (with the donated hand) and spiritually affect the other characters.<br />Although not a comic novel, this does have a lot of humor.  Besides the aforementioned subplot, there are also a lot of digs at TV journalism.  In the second half of the book, the humor decreases as events get more serious.  <br />I don't have any real problems with this book, other than that the widow is a little less likable than I think she is intended to be.  Other than that, I found this to be a great book and well worth my time.	2002-07-15

This book fits into the former category.<br />This book is a biography of Merriwether Lewis with the focus on his famous expedition with William Clark.  Ambrose does a good job describing the hardships that Lewis and Clark went through during their trip across the country. Few acts of exploration are comparable; they went across completely uncharted territory filled with both natural and human perils and suffered a minimal number of losses.<br />There is a lot of good material in here and Ambrose tries to be fair to all sides.  For example, Lewis is portrayed as heroic at times and rash or suicidal at others; the Indians they encounter are sometimes benevolent and sometimes hostile or thieving.  Ambrose portrays the individuals in these events as the complex characters they are.<br />As for Lewis and Clark, their names are inseparable in history, and Ambrose makes a good case that that would be okay with them.  They were good friends and had complementary skills that made their mission a success.  But in Ambrose's version of the story, Lewis is the main character, and that helps make his book a great read.	2002-07-12

Instead, it deals with a major subplot involving two brothers who have killed their parents and now have become involved with her life.  The fact that there are two separate storylines is a bit of a distraction, even if both stories are interesting.<br />This series is reminiscent of earlier private eye novels such as Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer books in which the private eye/narrator is essentially a noncharacter who observes the soap opera-like lives of the other characters.  Yes, Kinsey does have a life, but not much of one, and that's fine.  It makes this series more like the classic hardboiled mysteries of yesteryear, and that's a good thing.	2002-07-11

It is essentially a collection of first hand accounts from various people of this era.<br />Since most, if not all, of these accounts were originally in Spanish, they require translation, and that is the book's one weakness:  almost all the accounts read like they were written by the same person; some of the character of the individual writers is lost.<br />Nonetheless, this is a good book, both readable and fast-moving.  It is interesting that while we know a lot about the Revolutionary era and the founding of the United States, the topics in this book - which take place on the same continent at around the same time - are almost unknown.  That, in itself, makes this book a good read.	2002-07-02

The Eternal Champion went by various names:  Hawkmoon, Corum, Erekose and most notably, Elric.  <br />After a while, Moorcock apparently decided to go off in other literary directions.  Gone were the fun books; instead, there were more literary works such as Mother London; they may have been good (although I often found them unreadable), but they were not fun.  Now, Moorcock has returned to the material that made him famous.<br />Despite the way this book is marketed, it is not truly an Elric book, but rather the story of Ulric von Bek, an albino German horrified by the rise of Hitler and the Nazis.  Ulric, the descendant of other Eternal Champion incarnations, owns a family heirloom called Ravenbrand, a sword that is intimately linked with Elric's Stormbringer.  Ulric's struggles against the Nazis, in particular his cousin Gaynor, eventually link him us with Elric as well as other characters who are familiar to Moorcock fans.<br />This is a pretty good book, but a lot of the old Moorcock magic isn't there.  In particular, it moves a lot more slowly than earlier works, which is not surprising, since this is double the length of most of the original Elric stories.  In addition, Ulric is not much of a man of action, allowing other characters to take charge throughout the story.  Finally, there is a certain detached quality to the writing that makes it hard to empathize with the heroes or loathe the villains.<br />So there are flaws...Moorcock is not the same writer he was thirty years ago.  While more mature, he is also not as fun.  But this book still has its pleasures, and they outweigh the faults:  for Moorcock fans, this will be a little disappointing but still a good addition to their collection.	2002-07-01

It has held up well over this time span.  This is a fable, a warning of an era where free thought is squashed.<br />The world of Farenheit 451 is an unpleasant place.  Although nominally a democracy, the people elect only who they are told to; war is a constant threat and the general populace is kept in a state of blissful ignorance.  The only books that remain are dry manuals and rulebooks.<br />Guy Montag, the principal character, slowly becomes aware that there is more to existence than the narrow life that he has lived.  As he awakens to this new world, other cracks in the old regime become evident, most obviously with the number of suicides that are taking place.  Even if this dictatorship is weakening, it is far from dead, and as Guy begins to explore the world of books and free thought, he puts his life in danger.<br />Although written in the 1950s when television was just beginning, this novel seems to predict an era when TV has essentially replaced reading; fortunately, despite the dominance of television in today's world, books are far from out of fashion.  Although not an altogether happy novel, this book is generally optimistic in that it shows how difficult it is to truly contain the human spirit.  If it is not 100% realistic, it need not be; as stated before, this is a fable, and a classic in not only science fiction, but literature in general.	2002-06-26

Since MacDonald's passing around fifteen years ago, various authors have tried to fill the void left by McGee's absence.  Randy Wayne White and Doc Ford is the one of the best at filling this niche.<br />Ford has some similarities to McGee, but he is also distinctly individual.  An ex-government agent who is not trying to live a quiet life as a marine biologist, Ford occasionally is drawn into perilous situations as a result of either his own past, or as in this story, accident.  In this case, Ford happens upon and averts a kidnaping attempt, which entangles him in the lives of both the victim and the kidnapers.  In addition, Ford has to deal with a woman who claims to be his sister, who involves him in a legacy left by his shady uncle.<br />This is not the best Doc Ford novel.  In particular, the story tends to meander at times, and there is no truly nasty villain (unlike previous books) to oppose Ford.  Some incidents in the story, in particular an incident where Ford tries to reconcile two lovers, contribute nothing to the story and offer only minimal insight into Ford's character.<br />While there are flaws, this is still a good book and if you like mysteries, especially those set around Florida, this one will be worth your time.	2002-06-24
US	43083835	R2CMIY5AFJ59SC	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A classic flawed by pontificating	Starship Troopers is an essentially utopian novel.  Yes, there is a brutal war going on, but this is really the tale of what Heinlein considers the ideal society:  a militaristic regime where the truest source of social virtue is in service to one's country.  These utopian ideals lead to several rather preachy sections that distract from an otherwise good story; it's not that I disagree with the ideas - although, to some extent I do, I am perfectly willing to enjoy a novel with political views different from my own - it's just that the presentation of the ideas disrupts the flow of the story.<br />The story itself deals with a future Earth society at war with an alien race referred to as the Bugs.  The first half of the story deals with the basic training of Johnnie Rico in this futuristic army; the second half deals with the war he fights.  Since it is a war that humans are losing, Rico rises through the ranks as much by attrition as by ability.  The plot is rather simple, but Heinlein can make things move quickly.<br />The politics I referred to previously figure prominently in Rico's development.  Although Heinlein seems to embrace these ideas wholeheartedly, many will find them simplistic and disturbing, and as mentioned before, sometimes it seems Heinlein is less interested in the story than in commenting on contemporary society.  (Ironically, for a writer as obviously anti-communist as Heinlein, this story is about forsaking individuality for the benefit of a group and the idea that national service is better than money...both rather socialist ideas.)<br />Overall, however, this a good book.  I would recommend it for science fiction fans as one in a trilogy of human versus alien war novels that are classics in the genre.  The other two are Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card and The Forever War by Joe Haldeman.  All three novels are award-winning and cover the same subject in different manners.	2002-06-20
US	43083835	RTLT8B5UEEFJH	0525945415	900704564	A Slow Burning	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Starts okay but weakens	When Pottinger twice in the matter of a few pages says that a person has lowered her eyelids to half-mast, I could tell that this book was in trouble.  As I moved further and further in, things only got worse.<br />Having enjoyed The Fourth Procedure, I picked up this book with anticipation, but Pottinger is apparently suffering from a sophomore jinx.  This book, while it has some moments, has a considerable number of problems.<br />Perhaps the most serious problem is the lack of focus.  Even now, I am uncertain what the main idea behind the story is.  It may be a suspense novel about the hunt for a killer; it may be a tale of race relations; it may be a mystery about an incident that occurred seventy years earlier; or it may be a science fiction story about radical brain surgery and a method to detect and remove racial prejudice.  Done properly, these threads could be sewn together into a nice blanket, but this winds up being just a frayed rag.<br />After what is supposedly the main plot is resolved, the story drags on for another fifty or so pages, solving the seventy-year old mystery in excessive detail; since this mystery means so little to the story, this winds up being a big waste of time.  The villain is boring, the main characters are not very likeable, and, for a story dealing with prejudice, Pottinger indulges in a few stereotypes of his own.<br />If you enjoyed Pottinger's previous work, approach this novel with great caution.  If you have never read anything by him, this is not the place to start.	2002-06-18

The company has gone away and the town is slowly diminshing; the owner of this company still reigns over the city like a queen.<br />Miles Roby, the main character in the story, has ties to this woman that turn out to be deeper than he thinks.  Miles is an amiable enough person and is in fact so easy-going he is often a pushover for the people around him.  His wife is on the brink of divorcing him and his daughter has her own problems.<br />There is a lot of humor in this story, but it is not a comic novel.  Although some funny things happen, there are also some grim things.  In a way, the novel reminded me of the movie &quot;American Beauty&quot;: although the stories are not the same, the tone is similar, they both deal with a dysfunctional family, and they both show that superficial appearances can be deceiving.  In fact, although I don't often like to compare books to movies, I feel that the comparison is apt here:  if you enjoyed American Beauty, you will like this book as well.	2002-06-17

Nonetheless, Boone did provide important leadership during the early days of Kentucky's colonizations. Although a sympathetic biography of Boone, Faragher treats with great respect the Indians who Boone had numerous conflicts with.<br />Boone himself is portrayed as even-tempered and intelligent (though not well-educated), a man elevated to a legendary status by a contemporary biographer who was interested in Kentucky land speculation. Faragher's biography, sometimes exciting and sometimes slow, does a good job at separating myth from fact.<br />Since most biographies of figures of this era focus on people who were in the more developed areas of the colonies/states such as Philadelphia, Boston and New York, this biography is good at showing what life was like on the 18th century frontier.  ...	2002-06-12

Bitterroot is yet another indication that Burke is one of the top mystery writers around.<br />This tale of Billy Bob Holland (Burke alternates books between Texas lawyer Holland and Louisiana detective Dave Robicheaux) relocates the lawyer to Montana, where a vacation gets sidetracked by the rape of a friend's daughter and the subsequent murder of the rapists.  As Holland defends his friend from the murder, he gets involved with a series of unpleasant characters, including mobsters, militia members and most particularly, a psychotic ex-con intent on revenge against Holland for an imagined crime.<br />Holland is not as memorable a character as Burke's other series character, Dave Robicheaux, but he is still interesting, a man who is haunted by ghosts of his own making and whose intention to do good barely holds back a tendency to do great violence.  <br />The only flaw I could see in this novel is that Burke has a tendency to switch points of view from first person to third person without any real indication, which leads to brief confusion.  Nonetheless, this is a great book and a must-read for mystery fans.	2002-06-12

Spending most of his life in the frontier, the war had only an indirect effect on him.  Boone's contributions to history were to lie elsewhere.<br />Faragher writes a good - sometimes exciting, sometimes slow - chronicle of a life that is almost as much myth as fact.  Boone is depicted as a generally even-tempered and intelligent (though not well-educated) man who acted as a leader in the colonization of Kentucky.  His true significance is more based on myth, however, as he became the subject of a contemporary biography aimed at encouraging people to move to Kentucky.<br />In this fashion, Boone becomes a semi-legendary figure, alongside other Americans such as Davy Crockett and Kit Carson, for whom the fiction is more important than the fact.  Faragher does show that the real Boone was a relatively admirable person, though not without his faults.  <br />One final thing I enjoyed about this biography is that Faragher includes a final chapter that acts as an epilogue and shows Boone's impact after his death.  I like these sorts of epilogues and find them too rare in biographies.  For a different look at U.S. history, this book is a good way to go.	2002-06-11

The ancient gods are fading as they are being forgotten, and new gods, representing television, computers and other modern objects of worship, are coming into power.<br />Gaiman, more well-known for his critically acclaimed comic book writing does a good job here.  At times the story does drag a little and at other times he is a little unclear, but overall, he has written a good novel.<br />The obvious influence for this novel seemed to be Harlan Ellison's Deathbird Stories (with its tales of the gods of modern life), and I was pleased to see Gaiman acknowledge this influence in the afterword.  In style, however, this book is more reminiscent of Clive Barker at his peak.  As dark fantasy, this is a good work, and although there is some room for improvement, I'd be willing to read more by Gaiman.	2002-06-04

Although the title implies a balance between the two people, this is more a story of the &quot;Madman&quot;, W.C. Minor, a doctor beset by mental illness, confined for life after murdering a man during one of his more paranoid episodes.<br />Minor gets a chance to find some personal redemption by his vast contributions to the OED.  His unique approach to research, along with his involuntarily large amount of free time, made his the single largest contributor to the OED.  Murray (the &quot;Professor&quot;), the editor of the OED during a large portion of its creation, corresponded with Minor and was a huge force in maintaining the OED's existence during its early years.<br />This is a book about genius.  Winchester draws a lot of parallels between the lives of Murray and Minor and shows how the gift of genius can be both a blessing and a curse and can lead to triumph or tragedy.  Well written and a delight to read (its only real weakness is the lack of an index), this book is definitely worth the time to read.	2002-05-31

With Libra, I began to get my answer and was not all that impressed.<br />Although not completely conventional, the story is more straightforward than the other books I have mentioned.  Although a story dealing with conspiracy and assassination, it is basically lacking in suspense and action; for this reason, it must rely more on things like character, in particular that of Lee Harvey Oswald.<br />DeLillo portrays Oswald as a pathetic individual, a malfunctioning human whose failure is inevitable.  You don't really empathize with Oswald; instead, you observe him with the same fascination you would give to a train wreck.  The other characters in this story are more weakly depicted.<br />There are better novels dealing with the Kennedy assassination and possible conspiracies associated with it.  I recommend American Tabloid by James Ellroy, which is much better (and Ellroy's sequel, The Cold Six Thousand, while weaker, is also very good).  For DeLillo, while this is not a bad book, he is better off with his more unconventional stories.	2002-05-31

Usually, the better books (the early ones and the more recent ones) are the ones in which Davenport has a bit of an edge and isn't quite the nice guy himself; in this one, Davenport isn't as dark as he sometimes is, and that subtracts from the overall story.<br />That is not to say this isn't a good book, it just isn't one of the best in the series.  As usual, there is a good deal of suspense and a sufficiently nasty villain to keep things interesting.  There are flaws, however, most notably an ending that can be seen a mile away.<br />I think that Sanford needs to refocus this series a little more on Davenport, who can be a compelling character when he is really focused on.  Also, although it's not likely to happen, I wish that the titles in the series were a little more distinctive:  without reviewing plot summaries, it's hard to remember which Prey book is which...I think only Eyes of Prey and Rules of Prey stand out because they relate somewhat to the story.  <br />These criticisms should not take away from the fact that this is a generally good book.  It is a must for Sanford fans and will not be wasted time for mystery fans in general (although since this is part of a series, when read as a standalone book, there will be certain references that the new reader will not fully understand).	2002-05-30

Calhoun: A Biography	Books	4	24	27	N	N	Good, but distant biography	After reading this biography of John Calhoun, I had completed reading about the lives of the &quot;Great Triumvirate&quot; of Webster, Clay and Calhoun who, as Representatives, Senators and Secretaries of State were the most dominant non-Presidents in early-19th Century America.<br />Each of the Triumvirate had their assets and their flaws.  As this biography illustrates, Calhoun's great assets were his integrity and his intellect; his great flaws included his inflexibility and his adherence to promoting and continuing slavery.<br />As a biography goes, this one is good but not great.  It is a generally well-written work, but Bartlett has a tendency to speculate as to what Calhoun and others were thinking at particular moments and let a pro-Calhoun bias sometimes remove the objectivity from his work.  Despite this, I still did not feel I could really relate to Calhoun, who comes off kind of remote.<br />Overall, there is more good than bad in this book, however, and as an introduction to an important historical figure, this is a worthwhile read.	2002-05-20

This book, however, turned out to be somewhat disappointing.<br />While I understood that these biographies were intended to be brief, there were still details I felt were lacking, while for some biographies, there were almost too many details; that is, I felt that the authors tried to squeeze so much into a few pages that I began to lose the feel of what was going on.<br />Some of these biographies are better than others; the last one, for Elizabeth II, is particularly disappointing as the writer throws objectivity out the window.  In addition, for an oversized book like this, I would expect more illustrations and better captions...for some pictures with multiple people, there is no indication who is who.<br />As a quick reference source, this book is okay, but as an overview of the English monarchs, one could do better.  Despite its flaws, I would actually recommend Churchill's History of the English Speaking People over this.	2002-05-10

As soon as she is mentioned, along with her incredible beauty, I just knew that she was going to wind up with Stone.  Why?  Because every woman in this series is (a) beautiful and (b) winds up sleeping with Stone.<br />The interesting thing in this book at least is that Stone begins to see the repercussions of all his romances as three other women from past books come back into his life and his friend Dino explains why Stone is doomed to the single life.  Nonetheless, there is a predictability to this book that I know Woods can transcend.   In addition, the subplot regarding Stone's ex-wife Dolce contributes nothing to the main story.<br />The Barrington books are getting more and more like a soap opera filled with shallow romances among the rich and beautiful. While Woods is good enough that even his so-so stuff can rate three stars, he can certainly do better than this.	2002-05-09

As with his other horror novels, Disch breaks away from normal conventions; no one would confuse his work with Stephen King in either content or tone.<br />This story follows the descent into evil of a woman as she becomes infected with the malignant spirit of her father.  With her change in character come new and nasty powers.  <br />The main flaw with this story is its general air of unpleasantness.  There are few appealing characters and the book often has the feel of a rural soap opera.  Nonetheless, this is a well-written book and for horror fans, it is a nice change-of-pace story.	2002-05-08

Jefferson Parker has come out with around ten novels, all mysteries set in Orange County, California.  They have all been good reads, and this one is no different in that respect.<br />What is different and makes this one stands out is the principal character, a deputy (Joe) whose physical scars are not as bad as the ones he carries within.  Unlike most of Parker's novels, this one is written in the first person; this is important, since this story is as much about the character as the mystery.<br />Although Joe is always very civil and restrained, there is always something boiling under the surface.  The tension that is within Joe adds to the suspense and makes this novel stand out from Parker's other books.<br />I'm not alone in noticing that this book is exceptional; just recently, it won an LA Times book award for best mystery and it has received other praise as well.  If you are a Parker fan or a mystery fan in general, this is well worth the effort of reading.	2002-05-08

Although the biggest chapters involve crime or civil rights, he also looks into the evolution of the American family, transportation and communciations.  He also deals with the development of the legal profession.<br />This is very well-written, with more than the occasional bits of humor.  Although generally objective, he does come down hard on political conservatives at times (especially in the last part of the book).  Even if disagree with his politics, however, there is still enough good material in this book to make it a really good read.	2002-04-29

Both were looks at near-future dystopias written by non-science fiction authors. However, while Carr's novel shows his inability to write sci-fi, Boyle has proven he can work comfortably in this genre.<br />Switching back and forth between the 1990s and 2020s, A Friend of the Earth is a tale of environmental horror filled with ironic humor. Although in one sense it is an ecological gloom-and-doom story, it also mocks the far edge of the environmental movement. There is a theme that even these eco-terrorists are ineffective. <br />By leaving a twenty-plus year gap between the two narratives, Boyle even leaves it unclear what has happened to make nature go amok; this brings into question whether the environmental disasters are even man-made. Certainly, there is an almost wrathfully intelligent version of Nature in this story; many of the characters die of strange accidents; the more the enviromentalists try to save the world, the more the world goes out of its way to make their lives miserable.<br />Like other environmental horror novels I've read, including such classics as John Brunner's The Sheep Look Up and Harry Harrison's Make Room, Make Room, this story offers little hope to the modern reader. Unlike these other novels, which serve as warnings of a future that can be averted by wise acts, this story says that Nature is a force that we cannot control, for good or for ill. This hopelessness makes this a sometimes difficult novel to read, but the good writing and ironic humor makes it enjoyable nonetheless.	2002-04-24

This oral history gives a behind the scenes look at the incidents that shaped L.A. Dodger history.<br />Every big event from 1958-2000 is covered, from the move to Los Angeles to Koufax's retirement to the Big Blue Wrecking Crew to Kirk Gibson's famous home run to the selling of the team to Fox.  Delsohn does a good job at allowing both sides to speak about controversial issues and allows the reader to use his or her own judgment as to where the truth lies.<br />For any fan of baseball, I recommend this book.  For any fan of the Dodgers, I would say this is a must-read.	2002-04-22

It is instead the heart of the story.<br />Divided into two halves, the first half follows the majority of the Fellowship as they contend with the secondary but still very dangerous villain, Saruman.  The second half follows the hobbits Frodo and Sam as they are forced into an uneasy alliance with the weasely Gollum and approach the hellish land of Mordor.<br />Since this is the middle part of a larger story, few things are resolved.  This is fine, as this is not meant to be read as a standalone book.  It does, however, represent great storytelling, with rich detail and characters.<br />Many have tried to imitate this trilogy and few have come even close to being near Tolkien's level.  This story is not only one of the greatest fantasy stories ever, it is one of the great fictional works of the 20th Century.	2002-04-19

Freeman's book takes a look at 1790s America, when parties did not yet truly exist, and finds that it was not much better.<br />Some of the material here I have read in different form elsewhere, but there is also a lot of new stuff too.  In particular, the different methods of attacking political opponents were new to me.<br />Just as we often bemoan the existence of parties, we also sometimes complain about the lack of shame in today's society (as shown through reality TV, etc.).  This book also shows the flip side of this, to an era when honor and self-respect are deemed so important that even slight insults can lead to canings and duels.<br />Freeman does a good job at showing a political world that is quite different than our own.  If not perfect, this book is still good enough to recommend to anyone interested in the early history of the United States.	2002-04-18

While the others have been thoroughly entertaining, this one has been a bit of a disappointment.  While still suspenseful and loaded with the twists that Deaver is good at, there are definite storytelling flaws in this book.<br />Deaver does not do a great job with characterization in this story.  Beyond the two principal characters, most of the characters are rather weak.  More grating is the amount of space that Deaver takes to explain computer concepts; while I understand that the jargon makes the story more realistic, he is unable to convey the meaning of the jargon in a smooth fashion.  Instead, he is constantly having characters explain to other characters what certain terms mean.<br />Deaver has shown that he is a more skilled writer than he is in this work, but there is still enough entertainment value in this book to make it a decent but not great read.	2002-04-18

This book helps indicate why.<br />The Lord of the Rings was intended to be a single story, not a trilogy, so this volume is not a stand-alone novel.  Instead, it is the first two of six \\"books\\" into which Tolkien has divided his work.  Book one introduces the principal characters of Frodo, Sam and Aragorn and reintroduces (from the Hobbit) Gandalf and Bilbo.  It also outlines the dangers of the One Ring and the evil forces out to retrieve it.  The second book deals with the adventures of the fellowship in the title as they set off on a quest to destroy the ring.<br />Unlike the Hobbit, this is a work aimed towards adults. Tolkien does a wonderful job in telling his story and is unsurpassed in creating a setting that is rich in detail and history.  As fantasy, or just storytelling in general, this is top-of-the-line stuff.	2002-04-08

Of the &quot;great&quot; constants in mathematics such as 0,1,i,and pi, e is the black sheep of the family.  To the non-mathemetician, e rarely is thought of nor is its numerical value well-known.  (I am not spoiling anything by saying that e approximately equals 2.718281828).<br />Maor does a good job in showing how important this number actually is and how modern math would not exist without it.  e pops up in physics, astronomy and finance, as Maor demonstrates.  This book gives a history of e, which has only been known for a few hundred years (as opposed to its cousin, pi, which has been around for thousands).<br />This is a good, educational and entertaining book, admittedly a bit of a challenge for the non-mathematician, even though he limits his more complicated proofs to the appendicies.  My only real gripe with the book is the use of footnotes, which can sometimes be confused with exponents.  In many books, this might not be a problem, but with this topic, a different approach is needed.  Still, this is probably as much a publisher's problem as Maor's, and takes little away from an otherwise good book.	2002-04-05

Now, there are lots of fantasy novels and still, Tolkien is the best.<br />While The Lord of the Rings may be Tolkien's greatest and most influential work, the Hobbit cannot be lightly dismissed and is no less a classic than his trilogy.  Although essentially a children's story, it has an appeal to all ages (it is similar to the more recent Harry Potter stories in this respect).

The first, Underworld, is a hefty tome; this one is so brief it is actually questionable that it can be called a novel.  Certainly, the idea of paying a hardcover price for this book is ludicrous unless you're a diehard DeLillo fan.<br />This is kind of a ghost story, but there is more of a psychological than supernatural element to this ghost.  As with Underworld, I found this book to be fascinating without really being very clear.  DeLillo is brilliant at focusing on the minor details of life, but he makes it hard to see the bigger picture.  <br />It is also hard to get very interested in the main character in this story who is so self-absorbed that she has practically shut out the outside world.  A protagonist does not necessarily have to be sympathetic, but she should at least be interesting, and this one is not.<br />If you like descriptive language and are not too big on story or character, you might enjoy this book.	2002-04-01

A history of the screw and screwdriver has the potential for being really boring; fortunately, this brief book is not.  Instead, it is an interesting look at this commonplace tool.<br />In general working backwards from modern to ancient times, Rybczynski not only explores the origins of the screw and screwdriver, he also describes what he had to go through to discover these origins.  It shows how when something is such an everyday item, its very commonality may obscure its history.<br />The main flaw with this book is that he tends to ramble about quite a bit, so instead of moving straight back in time, he often darts in other chronological directions.  This can be a bit distracting.  Nonetheless, this is overall a good book which shows that in the hands of a decent writer, even minor objects can become important.	2002-03-29

This sub-category of the mystery genre focuses on a clever theft which often goes awry and the ensuing complications.  As such, it invites comparison to the great heist novels by Richard Stark (Donald Westlake) with Parker, and it holds up well in this fashion.<br />There are distinct differences from the Parker books, starting with the main character.  Cassie Black is much more \\"human,\\" a woman with a past that haunts her and motivates her to continue her life of crime.  This in turn makes the story much more emotionally engaging than the coolly fun Parker stories.<br />Unlike Connelly's other books, however, there are weaknesses in this story.  Cassie is an interesting but not very sympathetic character, and there are twists at the end that are either unnecessary or out of left field.  These are, overall, minor gripes, however, and do not really take away from the good quality of the book.<br />For many other authors, this might be a five-star book, but for Connelly - a consistent five-star writer - this book merits less as it is below his usual work.  That is not to say this isn't a good book, but it's not as great as his other works.  Even weak Connelly beats many other authors at their strongest.	2002-03-28

This is his other great work, published after his death and assembled by his son, a history of Middle Earth prior to the Ring books.<br />If the Hobbit is designed to appeal to kids and The Lord of the Rings to appeal to teens and young adults, this one is definitely for an older crowd.  I say this not derogatorily, because these works are all great, but the Silmarillion is not an easy read compared to the others.<br />It is the complexity of this book that shows just how skilled Tolkien is.  This is a tale of myths and legends, designed almost to be a bible of Middle-Earth.  It is not a novel but a collection of stories dealing with the days when the world was young.  When you read this book, you realize how deep in detail Middle Earth is, and how comparitively shallow most other fantasy worlds are.<br />Beyond this, although not as simple to read as other Tolkien stories (but still entertainingly readable), the tales in this book are exciting and compelling.  <br />This work reaffirms what the general state of the fantasy genre is:  ....  To truly appreciate what fantasy can be, this is a must read.	2002-03-22

This is around 800 pages of what a terrible person Napoleon was.<br />Schom definitely does a good job at portraying Napoleon as the great villain of 19th Century Europe:  he describes Napoleon as a deceitful, cowardly megalomaniac and egotist whose successes are as much the result of luck as genius and whose ambition was destructively vast.  Unfortunately, he makes Napoleon so virtueless, it seems inexplicable that he rose so high.<br />This is an entertaining read, a long soap opera of intrigues and betrayal inside the entire Bonaparte family.  It is not, however, a good biography.  Despite his claims to the contrary, Schom is not very objective, and his opinions permeate this work.  A good historian can let the facts speak for themselves; Schom cannot.<br />Based on quality of writing alone, I would probably give this book four stars.  It loses a star, however, as it does not deliver on what it promises:  an impartial biography of Napoleon.	2002-03-18

A Mathematician Looks at Voting	Books	5	13	13	N	N	An Insightful Look at Voting	Saari has put together a small but useful book on the trickiness inherent in voting and the potential paradoxes that can get minor candidates elected.  In races with more than two candidates, the method of vote counting is extremely important, and it is possible that by changing the counting process, you could have any candidate you want winning.  Theoretically, an election could be rigged without a single dishonest vote.<br />The obvious solution is to choose the counting method before the election, not afterwards, but there are perils to watch out for nonetheless.  Saari goes into depth about these dangers.<br />This depth often gets very technical, something Saari is up front about.  Less than half the book is really aimed for the lay reader; the remainder is aimed more towards mathematicians.  Nonetheless, I recommend this book for everyone interested in the democratic process; even if you can't get into the math, there are still enough important insights to make this book more than worthwhile.	2002-03-15

Yes, they were often silly, but they were also good entertainment.<br />Recently, however, Land has gotten more realistic and serious with his series of novels featuring Ben Kamal and Danielle Barea, a pair of detectives and star-crossed lovers (he's Palestinean, she's Israeli) who take on mysteries and conspiracies that often extend beyond the borders of their homes.  <br />As is the case in most of this series, the two usually deal with separate mysteries that turn out to be linked.  In this case, they must deal with the murders of several teenagers who attended the same school as well as the attempted murder of a philanthropic billionaire with a secret past.  There are traces of Land's love of secret organizations and conspiracies, and it all comes together nicely.<br />Just because Land has become more serious does not mean he has gotten worse; in fact, there is a maturity in his writing that is an improvement.  Nonetheless, I kind of miss the sillier Land and hope that some day McCracken returns.	2002-03-12

Even then, we realize to some extent that infinity is not truly the largest number because there is always something bigger.<br />Maor gives a brief history of the concept of infinity and how it fits into the worlds of art and science.  This is a generally good book although there are a couple of errors (such as when he mixes up the concepts of whole numbers and integers).  Maor is good at illustrating just how big infinity is without getting either overly technical or metaphysical (a problem with the last book I read on infinity, whose title I forget).  Maor also shows how there are different sizes of infinity; it is often hard to conceive that there are more irrational numbers between 0 and .00001 then there are rational numbers along the whole number line.<br />With the exception of the couple of minor errors mentioned above, this is a good book.  Infinity is a difficult concept to grasp, but with this book, you can do just that.	2002-03-05

The first book dealt with the sixty-two years of Eisenhower's life before he became president.  This volume deals with the last seventeen years of his life, focusing particularly on his eight years as President.<br />It is clear that Ambrose likes Eisenhower, but he nonetheless is critical of Eisenhower when it is appropriate.  If one of the lessons of the first book is how politics can have a negative effect on a principled man, the main lesson in this one is how moderation is both a virtue and a vice.<br />For Eisenhower, it is a virtue when he besieged by extremists within his own party who are all too willing to use nuclear weapons and it is he who stays a middle course. As moderation's negative image, hesitancy, however, it is a vice as he fails to take on McCarthy or segregation.  As one of the most continuously popular presidents in history, Ike could have done more in these areas.<br />Overall, however, Eisenhower comes off as a President whose accomplishments are generally underrated.  Ike himself generally comes off as a good person, honest and intelligent, with a vision of a better America that many would agree with, one without the threat of nuclear war.<br />There are a couple little errors in the book and its predecessor, but that doesn't take away from this volume's high caliber.  This is a great biography, well written, detailed and always interesting.	2002-02-26

As a result, his story suffers.  In science fiction, there has to be a proper balance between ideas and plot, and the balance is way off here.<br />The premise of the story involves a group of people who are out to save humanity from itself.  The leader of the group, although portrayed nobly, is actually a James Bond-style villain:  a megalomaniac armed with superinventions and his own little army of subservient geniuses.  This bit of silliness is not enough to brighten up a dreary novel, nor is the utterly ludicrous ending.<br />The narrator, one of this band of hero/villains, relates the story as if he is writing a warning to his contemporaries, yet he constantly discusses historic events in more detail than would be necessary, considering his audience.  In addition, he is overbearing with his foreshadowing, constantly saying &quot;If only we knew that...&quot; and such things.<br />As stated before, this is a downbeat novel with little to recommend it other than the author's name.  Fans of the Alienist may have a desire to read this one, but it's bound to disappoint.  Of course, fans of science fiction or just plain fans of good books will be even more disappointed.	2002-02-18

In the caper novel, one of the masters, actually one of the grandmasters, is Donald Westlake.  Whether writing Parker novels as Richard Stark or the Dortmunder books (Parker's comic opposite) under his own name, Westlake always delivers.<br />To those unfamiliar with Parker (most recently portrayed cinematically in the fun movie, Payback), he is a violent and generally amoral thief whose cold, almost mechanical approach to his job and life lead to his general success.  Parker is not a nice guy, but he is compelling to read about.  <br />The story this time is familiar enough; Parker gets ripped off and goes after the thieves who betrayed him.  Along the way, he makes enemies and allies who complicate his plans.  Revenge isn't the proper word for what Parker seeks, since that would imply a level of emotions that he doesn't have; instead, Parker seeks balance:  those who defy his code must be punished to restore balance.<br />How important is this sense of balance to Parker?  Along the way to his final confrontation, he winds up stealing far more than he originally lost, but it means little:  he still wants the original money.  He is actually more interested in people who steal from him than people who kill him.<br />If you like crime novels, you can't go wrong with Parker (or Westlake's books in general).  Reading a Parker novel gets to the basics of what a caper book is all about:  clever plotting and plenty of action.	2002-02-18

That is this book in a single sentence.<br />Seife (who, amusingly has a name similar to &quot;cipher,&quot; which has the same word origins as zero) starts this book off as a history of mathematics and the usefulness of zero in mathematical thought.  He then goes off into physics and the zeroes associated with absolute zero, black holes and the big bang.<br />While Seife has created a book that is quite readable and has a lot of good illustrations, there is very little that is original here.  Anyone with a familiarity of math history would know everything in the first half of the book, and anyone who has read anything about modern cosmology would be familiar with the second half.<br />Since this book does not get too deep in anything it covers, it might be a good introduction to these ideas, but for anyone who already has encountered these concepts before, this book offers little.	2002-02-16

There are so many exceptions to the rules that it is a wonder so many people can ever become fluent in it.  But the complexities of the language almost make it so wonderful:  it is a language of incredible diversity that is able to evolve and adapt to changing situations.  It is great for wordplay and it is great for literature.<br />Bryson's book illustrates the wonders of this language and discusses English's history and the quirks it developed along the way.  Why do we pronounce colonel with an &quot;r&quot;?  Or use a &quot;w&quot; in one?  Such items are discussed within?<br />This is a language appreciation book.  It is filled with fun facts.  If I rate it at four stars, it is not because of the material, but because of how it is presented.  There is some redunancy in the book, almost as if each chapter was written independently and then tied together later; there are also times when he refers to an upcoming chapter when really he means a previous one.  Finally, although this is a matter of personal taste, I prefer my citations in footnotes, not in the text itself.<br />Despite these problems, I do recommend this book to almost anyone who can read English.  It is a great way to make any English reader appreciate his or her language.	2002-02-14
US	43083835	R2DKOPNSP4XXQU	0451204530	356134546	Code To Zero	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Classic Follett	There are certain plot devices in fiction that raise red flags with me because they are almost always indicative of a lack of originality:  the two that stand out the most are the use of twins and even worse, amnesia.  But any cliche, in the right hands, can become something special.  Follett first demonstrated this with The Third Twin and now, in this amnesia-driven story, with Code to Zero.<br />Follett is known as a master of the spy thriller, and this story demonstrates why:  likeable characters, evil conspiracies that slowly unfold, constant action and romance.  It surprises me that there seems to be so many negative reviews for this work, when there is really nothing significantly wrong with this; in this genre, Follett does everything that is expected and does it all well.	2002-02-12

Fortunately, this book is far superior to Ambrose's more recent work.<br />Ambrose does a great job at showing what Eisenhower was like prior to his election as President.  Although a generally affectionate work, Ambrose also points out the flaws in the man.  The book shows the value of hard work and intelligence, as Ike was essentially a self-made man who got where he was without any special family or friend connections.<br />This book also depicts the dangers of politics.  As Eisenhower gets more involved in the political arena, he becomes a less admirable person, succumbing to the hypocrisy that seems inherent in that field.  <br />This is a well-written portrait of one of the more significant people of the last century.  I look forward to reading the second volume and learning more about Eisenhower the President.	2002-02-11

At first, this is intriguing, but after a hundred digits or so, it gets a little tedious, and after the first thousand it's a struggle.  Nonetheless I got to the conclusion, and was pleasantly surprised to find out the last digit was 1.<br />Seriously, this is a fun book filled with interesting facts about this transcendental number.  It is a history of the struggles to find this number with greater and greater precision, but it is also a grab bag of other material showing pi's &quot;ability&quot; to show up in unlikely places.<br />The presentation of the book is a bit flawed, almost causing this book to lose a star.  In particular, some of the text is hard to read because it is on top of an illustration.  Since this probably as much the fault of the publisher as the writer, however, I won't rate this lower that five stars.  If you enjoy math, this is a fun little diversion, and you might even learn a thing or two in the process.	2002-02-11

We continue to see his influence today.  For example, just think how many of his plays have been made into movies since 1990 alone:  off the top of my head, I can think of Hamlet (3 times), Othello (twice), Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Love's Labor Lost, Romeo and Juliet, Titus Andronicus, Richard III, King Lear (A Thousand Acres) and The Taming of the Shrew (10 Things I Hate About You), plus Macbeth, coming out soon.  Harold Bloom dedicates 700+ pages to the idea that Shakespeare was the best, with a focus on the characters and their development.<br />Bloom definitely knows his stuff and provides some interesting insight.  Unfortunately, this book has distinct flaws.  The biggest is that he assumes you have read all of Shakespeare plus a lot of other literature (especially Marlowe), and if you haven't, you won't get all he is going to say.<br />The other overriding problem is that Bloom is, put bluntly, an intellectual snob.  In literature, where most things are matters of opinion, he writes as if he speaks gospel truth.  At first, it is refreshing to read someone who speaks with so many absolutes, but after a while, it gets bothersome.  I sometimes got the feeling that Bloom was making up words by throwing &quot;-ians&quot; and &quot;isms&quot; after every name to create new schools of thought; maybe that is typical of Bloomianism.  I also feel that he dismisses the concept of reading merely for fun; entertainment alone is not enough for Bloom.<br />As stated before, Bloom has some good insights, and there may be parts of this book I will revisit in the future, but I cannot recommend it to any but the most diehard Shakespeare fans.  For others, I recommend the superior Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare; Asimov is no literary critic, but he provides a good overview to the plays in plain language.	2002-02-04

True, it is nonfiction, but it is a mystery, nonetheless, the mystery of David.  Halpern does a good job of solving this mystery and showing us what the real David was probably like, but it is a rough journey to see the solution.<br />Halpern has done his research and definitely knows his stuff.  Unfortunately, he is not very good at presenting his material; this book has all the detail and tedium of a courtroom trial (although he does give warnings about the most technical chapters).  The overall organization is not well-thought out; he revisits the same information over and over again.<br />I think that this is almost a good book.  Halpern does get his point across and shows that David was not as heroic as he is often thought of.  He brings out the reality behind the myth.  If he only could lay out the details better, this book would go from almost good to either good or great.	2002-01-30

Given that it has a lot of illustrations, this book may have just over 100 pages of actual text.<br />The concepts described in this book can be rather heady, so it is not surprising that sometimes the reading gets a little tough.  Hawking does, however, simplify the concepts enough so you can at least get a good idea of what is being described.  But ideas like string theory, even at their simplest, are not easy to grasp.<br />The book's greatest strength, however, is also its greatest weakness:  the illustrations.  Many are useful, but others do nothing more than look interesting...they don't illustrate anything.  In addition, the brevity of the book leaves me demanding more.  <br />For these reasons, I cannot give it the full five stars.  As an introduction, this book is fine, but for anything more, you need to go elsewhere.  I actually suggest The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene	2002-01-29

In fact, it was a bad book:  an obvious rip-off of Tolkien with very little in the way of originality. This book was a nice change of pace.  Here, Brooks shows that he can tell a story that is his own.  In addition, his writing skills show clear improvement over the first book.  <br />At best, however, this rates a weak four stars.  Brooks has not yet matured into a great writer.  His characters remain weak:  in particular, his villains are almost all rather faceless; the demons in this book are more like a malicious force of nature than true characters.  In addition, outside of the few principal heroes, most of the other \\"good guys\\" are bland.<br />There are other little flaws, but the one that stands out is that Brooks is not (yet, at least) a great fantasist.  His world lacks the true definition of Tolkien's Middle Earth or Donaldson's Land.  Names, for example, seem to be mostly pulled out of a hat, and have little relation to the race of the characters (this was worse in the first book).  In addition, considering that this story takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, Brooks never truly exploits this history.<br />If I sound overly critical, that is not to take away from the fact that overall, this is a decent story that is reasonably entertaining.  It shows Brooks is developing as a writer, even if he isn't there yet.  If this maturing continues, he could have great books in the future.	2002-01-29

It is easily the shortest of the three, which is perhaps good, because it also easily the weakest.<br />Like the other two books, this volume is essentially a collection of short biographies.  This time, the people being written about are primarily philosophers.  The problem is that the common theme that ties all these people together is elusive; at the end of the book, I was still unclear what the whole book was about; in parts, it is okay, but as a whole, it is not.  It is like connecting the dots when the dots are misnumbered or some are missing:  either way, you aren't going to get the right picture.<br />The other problem is that some portions of the book are tedious to read.  I think this ties into my first problem; since I had only vague hints at Boorstin's intention with this book, I found it harder to get through.  This isn't a mystery novel; the meaning should not be something that is guessed at.<br />For those who have read the other books in this trilogy, this book will come as a disappointment.  I do give it a weak three stars, however, as there are some chapters that are at least interesting and informative.  Overall, however, this book is below average.	2002-01-24
US	43083835	R1YXEKYMYVFI89	0345345010	319491892	River of Dancing Gods	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Amusing fantasy	This is a lightweight but nevertheless entertaining fantasy novel.  What makes this book stand out is Chalker's taking on the cliches of fantasy.  If this wasn't clearly a parody, it would be nothing more than a routine novel.  Certainly, the plot involving two &quot;real world&quot; individuals who must go to a fantasy land to save it is nothing original; it's how Chalker plays with the standard conventions that makes this an above average story.<br />There are flaws, admittedly.  The characters are rather bland and often fit into the cliches that Chalker is trying to ridicule.  Also, too much time is spent on the set-up (around 60% of the book) and too little time on the actual adventure (and the final battle is somewhat anticlimactic).  However, if this viewed as only volume one in a larger four volume story, perhaps the setup isn't too long; after all, Tolkien took a couple hundred pages to get his fellowship moving.<br />This book is a fun, quick read.  I recommend it especially to people familiar with fantasy as they'll understand the humor more readily.	2002-01-23

Even if the name is not familiar, his works are:  the title story has been shown in both Twilight Zone the TV show and movie and even been spoofed on the Simpsons.  Another story in the collection, Prey, has also become a TV horror classic as part of the 70's movie, Trilogy of Terror.  Matheson is also the author of the Incredible Shrinking Man, What Dreams May Come, Somewhere in Time, Stir of Echoes and I Am Legend.<br />In this set of short stories, Matheson shows he is worth all the praise he is given.  The weakest of these stories are merely good and the best are not only great, but classics.  Besides his talent to create fantastic horror scenarios and true suspense, he also can leave you thinking at the end of the story.  In many of these tales, you are never quite certain if there is something supernatural going on or if it is all imagined by the main character.  This intentional ambiguity, done incorrectly can frustrate the reader but in Matheson's hands, it adds an extra level of depth.<br />If you enjoy horror fiction, this collection is a must.  It gives you an opportunity to read one of the most important and underrated persons in the genre.	2002-01-21

It has a pace that some may find slow, but I think of as more leisurely, allowing suspense to build slowly and often leaving the conclusion unknown until the final out.  If you're down twenty points in football with a minute left, there's no way you're going to win; if you're down three runs (a similar three scores as in the football example), there is at least still a chance.<br />The dramatic twists of fate in baseball are only part of makes the sport great.  There is also the rich history and the colorful characters.  And unlike almost any other team sport, baseball lends itself well to the narrative structure; when you read about a baseball game, you can picture exactly what happened.  An entire game could be described on paper and you can see it all in your mind; try this with a basketball game and you'll be disappointed.<br />Thus this book.  Take some of the great writers (in sports or otherwise), give them the best sport to write about, and you can't go wrong, and this one doesn't.  As an anthology, not every story is equally fantastic, but they are all good.  They serve as a reminder of what makes baseball great: its drama, its history and its character.	2002-01-19

The obvious ancestor of this book is Edgar Rice Burroughs's Mars books, which are likeways fantasy that use science as a mere device to get the story going.  <br />Like Burroughs's John Carter, Tarl Cabot is a man who is mysteriously transported to another world (this one a planet on the opposite side of the sun).  On this new world, Cabot becomes a warrior and gets involved with the intrigues of this feudalistic planet.  <br />In one sense, this is a fun novel, pure adventure with no greater purpose than to amuse and in this sense, it largely succeeds.  On the other hand, there are times when the last-minute rescues get a little out of control.  <br />Similar to Burroughs, Norman often shows a perception of the world that is less than modern.  While Burroughs had 19th century values that bordered on racism in his books, Norman's book shows the seeds of the misogyny and sadomasochism which I understand gets completely out of hand in his later books.  At least Burroughs is the product of his time; Norman seems to be around a millenium out of his.  Nonetheless, for an adult who can see past these things, which are not so overt as to be truly bad, there is a good tale to be enjoyed.	2002-01-19

Now Jefferson Davis joins this group.  <br />A common trait in these biographies (as well as others I've read) is that the writer, while usually objective, in general looks favorably upon his subject.  To some degree, this makes sense, as the writer would not spend years of his life on a subject he really didn't like.  With Jefferson Davis, a person who is often considered one of the villains in American history, this presents more of a challenge.<br />In this work, Davis comes off as neither a hero or a Hitler, but somewhere between:  a strongly principled man who unfortunately had some majorly incorrect principles, especially when it came to slavery.  It is a very interesting read, and though I disagree with the basis for the Southern cause, it was fascinating to read another point of view.<br />Although well-written, this book does have some flaws.  Although reasonably objective, Cooper occasionally allows his pro-Davis bias to distort or omit certain facts.  In addition, at times he skips around a bit in the chronology, which is a bit confusing.  Nonetheless, there is enough good material here to rate it around four-and-a-half stars, which I round up here to five.  To enjoy reading this book does not mean to agree with Davis; it just means you have an opportunity to broaden your knowledge of the Civil War era.	2002-01-18

Back in the days when this book first came out, there wasn't a whole lot of post-Tolkien fantasy...primarily the Shannara books and Donaldson's far more imaginative Thomas Covenant books.  Perhaps to a fantasy-hungry audience, this may have been what the doctor ordered, but this is not a classic by any means.<br />The first problem with this book is it is an obvious Tolkien ripoff.  Not only do many of the characters have direct Lord of the Rings parallels (Shea equals Frodo, Flick equals Sam, Allanon equals Gandalf, etc.), but there are many story events that mirror LOTR events as well.  This indicates that either Brooks was incapable of originality or more likely was merely capitalizing on people who wanted more Tolkien and would settle for a cheap imitation.<br />Even to a reader unfamiliar with Tolkien, however, there are numerous problems.  Most obviously, Brooks is not a great wordsmith; neither his dialogue nor descriptions are particularly good.  Plotwise, there are far too many last-minute rescues and coincidences.  There is also far too much going on; no character appears in more than a third of a novel, not even the principal protagonist, Shea.  This makes the story lose focus.  And Shea himself is a weak character, rarely acting, almost always reacting.  His triumphs are more accidental than anything else.<br />This was Brooks's first novel, and given that he continues to be published, I assume that he matures over time.  This book may be good for a talented beginner, but it is by no means one of the great works of fantasy.	2002-01-10

Fortunately, the time he puts into his work shows and nearly all of his works are five-star quality.  This book, a non-fiction follow-up to This Is My God (which is the only book of his I haven't read), continues the high-quality trend.<br />Although designed for a Jewish audience, this book has plenty to offer anyone who wishes to learn more about Judaism and the direction it is going.  This is a good blend of history, theology and memoir, well-organized and filled with detail without losing readability.  I found of particular interest the second part, &quot;The Heritage, or the Power of a Dream&quot; which describes the sources of Jewish thought and tradition.<br />Although not very religious myself, I am often fascinated with religion, and this book is a good addition to my collection on the subject.  As he states in the Afterword, &quot;If this book in any way helps readers to rethink the [future of Judaism] for themselves, I will have done, to the best of my ability, what I set out to do.&quot;  He has accomplished this task very well.	2002-01-07

The bad news is that this, his first novel after the accident is only a mild entertainment.<br />The main problem with this story is that it revisits a lot of the ideas he has explored in other stories.  The idea of alien visitation and people slowly falling apart (both physically and mentally) is reminiscent of The Tommyknockers.  There are psychic powers that hearken back to The Shining.  There is plague like The Stand.  There is a back-and-forth storyline between adulthood and childhood as in It.  And I could go on.<br />I suppose when you've written as much as King has, you will revisit old ideas, but it is uncommon to revisit so many.  Not that this story doesn't have a degree of originality or a lack of suspense, it's just at times, I felt been-there-done-that.<br />There are other flaws in this story too, in particular one villain (Kurtz) who is more insane than evil and in some implausible fashion is in a position of leadership.  It is a testament to King's abilities, however, that even in this essentially weak effort, he still puts forth a book that isn't really bad but is just so-so.	2002-01-04

Every now and then you get something sweet like an M&amp;M or something tasteless like a cracker.  For the most part, however, you're getting either lima beans or rocks.  This book is that trail mix.<br />Although there is some good stuff (just enough to give this a two-star rating), for the most part the articles are pretty poor.  Interestingly, they vary as to why they are so poor.  Some of the authors are paranoid, some are incoherent and some are delusional.  Many are tedious.  Some are just plain wrong: especially outstanding in this area is one article that dismisses Osama bin Laden being a terrorist.<br />The major fault lies with Russ Kick who edited this book and apparently didn't subject the contributors' works to any real scrutiny.  Many of the allegations are based purely on anecdotal evidence (yet they tend to dismiss others who rely on such evidence).  Some present outlandish scientific theories:  one states that humans have been around for hundreds of millions of years on only scanty evidence...in the end, he goes further and says that humans are actually devolving from some other spirtitual plane (maybe interesting, but not scientific).<br />Unfortunately, there are too many articles to really critique all of them.  And it's a shame, because some of the issues raised are important, even if they are presented poorly.  This could have been a good book, but it isn't.  If you decide to read it, watch out for those rocks.	2001-12-28

Such stories as &quot;Love at First Sight,&quot; &quot;A Weekend to Remember&quot; and &quot;The Reclining Woman&quot; are mild entertainments with none of the great irony that his stories have been noted for.  On the other hand, his more original stories such as &quot;Chalk and Cheese&quot; and &quot;The Letter&quot; show Archer's regular cleverness.<br />For a writer as adept with the short story as he is with the novel, this collection is a bit of a disappointment.  If given the opportunity, I would rate this three-and-a-half stars, a good star less than Archer usually merits.	2001-12-24
US	43083835	R3DRCV2SEG30AY	0553582747	255570129	From the Corner of His Eye	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Another worthy Koontz thriller	There was a time when I considered Dean Koontz and Stephen King to be the same type of horror writer, with Koontz's fare slightly more upbeat (or at least not as downbeat).  Now, I see the differences more clearly.  King may be the better writer, but Koontz is more consistently good.  I can't say I've ever really been disappointed in a Koontz book, which is more than I can say for King.<br />Koontz is first and foremost a storyteller.  If the characters are forgettable or the thematic elements sparse, you are nonetheless compelled to keep turning the pages.  A week later, you may not recall exactly what all the characters were named, but while it is going on, you are having a blast.  <br />While this may not qualify him for any great awards, it makes him a fun read.  This book shows that he is not losing his touch.  In addition to his usual plot elements, he cleverly takes a series of storylines and shows how certain apparent coincidences are not so accidental after all.<br />There is a bit of silliness about quantum physics that adds a supernatural element to the story, and the story wraps up too quickly to merit five stars (the final battle is a bit weak).  But overall, if you like Koontz, you won't be disappointed.  And if you've never read him, chances are you won't be disappointed either.	2001-12-22

Not only has Harry and his friends showing signs of growing up, but Rowlings has assumed her readers are maturing as well.<br />Easily the darkest of the four novels, this may too intense for the younger readers in the series.  The effects of evil are much clearer than in the past novels:  the viciousness of Voldemort and other villains are much more pronounced.<br />Also clear is that not all threats come from the truly evil.  The forces of ignorance - embodied in particular by Rita Skeeter and the Dursleys - provide another peril that abets the more obvious villains.<br />There is a depth in plot and character (and a page count) that are unusual in a novel aimed towards children.  This shows Rowlings's talent and willingness to assume the best in her audience.  The nice thing is that her assumption seems to be true.	2001-12-18

Chabon has shown he deserves a place of merit in this special genre.<br />Having read The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay and having seen the movie upon which this book is based, I felt certain that this book would be a pleasant read, and it was.  It also shows the dangers of reading a book after seeing a cinematic depiction of it...it almost certainly reduces the amount of enjoyment you will get.<br />The book and movie are similar though not completely alike.  Certainly, many of the principal characters are physically different from how they are shown on film; plot-wise, however, the story is almost identical.<br />What you get from the book that you don't get from the movie is a greater depth and more insight as to why narrator Grady Tripp is the way he is.  There is a good balance of drama and humor (including a rather silly reference to the Fantastic Four that once again shows Chabon's affection for comic books) as the protagonist goes through a simultaneously absurd and plausible weekend.	2001-12-16

If a book can do that - and this one can - it almost certainly merits five stars.<br />Even before finishing this book, I knew that the largest amount of criticism would come from people who disagreed with the views presented in the story on abortion.  A quick scan of the one-star reviews reaffirmed this.  <br />While there is a definite pro-choice slant to the story, there is also a legitimate attempt to present the other side of the issue with some even-handedness.  Sure, the villains are arch-conservatives (though not all the arch-conservatives are villains) and the protagonists are generally (but not completely) moderate or liberal, and this may reflect Patterson's own views, but that is not the point.  If you write a political suspense story, you need politics and that means that the heroes and villains need to be one side or the other.  If all the characters were on the same side - or even worse, politically neutral - then even if the story was inoffensive, it would also be boring.<br />I can enjoy a story in which I disagree with the themes (political or otherwise) provided it is not a political tract disguised as fiction.  Even if I agreed with the themes, I would still dislike a novel if it didn't put the story first.  <br />Interestingly, the theme of this novel is that you judge things on merits, not irrelevancies.  In the story, this meant judging a potential Chief Justice on her legal abilities and not on her personal life.  Similarly, this story should be judged on its merits: a well-executed plot, rich details and compelling characters.  Those who dismiss this book merely because it doesn't agree with their own political views do it a disservice.	2001-12-14

His principal contribution was Common Sense, a pamphlet that spurred the independence movement in the early days of the Revolution.<br />One of the themes that seemed to run through Paine's life was a commitment to ideology that often had negative effects.  While he was a man who backed his words with actions, he did it at a cost:  he had few lifelong relationships, he was often broke and he even spent a year in jail, with the threat of execution constantly hanging over him.  In the conflict between idealism and practicality, Paine favored the former.<br />Fruchtman's biography does a good job in describing this important historical figure.  At times slow (I feel because there are points in Paine's life that aren't very interesting), it is overall a good, educational read.  It makes me feel that if Paine had exercised a little bit more common sense in his own life, he might have been even a greater man.	2001-12-11

Brooks, Jordan and Eddings himself are guilty of this crime.  I give Eddings credit for this one thing:  he has written a standalone fantasy novel, something which doesn't really exist.  For this reason, Eddings gets an extra star and thus avoids the ignonimy of a one-star review.  <br />There is not much good in this novel, just enough to plod through it rather than put it down in the middle.  The problems are probably too much to enumerate, but I'll mention the ones that come immediately to mind:<br />(1) This is the same basic story Eddings has already told in the Belgariad and Malloreon.  Not only has he retold it in the Elenium/Tamuli, he repeats it again here.  (2) Even within the book, Eddings repeats himself, telling the same anecdote time and time again (note to author:  we remember the incident when we read about it a hundred pages ago).  (3) It is bad storytelling to have characters spend 50-100 pages planning something and then watching the plan unfold more or less as scheduled.  After the introductory material, this sequence runs through the remainder of the book.<br />More:  (4) In a tale that is supposed to be good vs. evil, it would be fitting if the good guys were actually good, not just mercenary.  This is really a tale of amoral vs. evil.  (5) The &quot;good&quot; guys are so skilled and the villains so dimwitted that there is no true sense of menace or suspense. (6) The time travel material isn't very logical; when Althalus goes back in time, why doesn't he meet himself?  If it was explained, it wasn't very clear?<br />For many authors, I'd say this was poor writing, but considering Eddings's previous work, this novel is an embarassment.	2001-12-06

Although debunking second amendment myths is only a small part of this book, it is certain to incur the wrath (and one-star reviews) of those who don't want to be told that the bases for their way of thinking are not as strong as they had hoped.<br />Nonetheless, a four star review may be a bit strong for this work.  I primarily rate it this way rather than the three to three-and-a-half stars that it merits to counterbalance some of the underservedly harsh reviews that have been previously issued.<br />Although this claims to be a history, this book is actually around 40% history, 40% political science and 20% opinion piece.  Where this book deviates from its theme and gets into borderline ranting (even if I may agree with what is being stated), are where the book is mostly flawed.  In addition, Willis is a little too dismissive of other points of view; for example, I've read a couple of Akhil Amar's works and - while I don't agree with all of Amar's points - I do feel he presents a strong argument.<br />Nonetheless, this book is an effective way to disprove some of the anti-government myths which are used as ideological foundations for many organizations on both ends of the political spectrum.	2001-12-02

Although he states his intention to discuss eight of the founding fathers (or in the case of Abigail Adams, founding mother), the principals in this work are really Jefferson, Adams and Washington.  Franklin and Madison, in particular, are much more in the background.<br />Not unique to this book is the premise that Adams is the underrated member of this pantheon, especially due to Jefferson, who comes off, if not villainous, certainly unpleasant.  It is interesting that alone among these revolutionary figures (discounting the traitorious Burr), Adams is not acknowledged on our most ubiquitous monuments, our coins and cash (of course, Madison, also rather underrated, is limited to the $5,000 bill).<br />In the end, however, this book loses a star because it really doesn't cover any new ground, just explores it in a different manner.	2001-11-25

Doherty is actually showing glimmers of understanding how to write in this story.  At some points, his characters are no longer one dimensional, but actually show two dimensions.  There is still no depth, however.<br />Unfortunately, as Doherty improves some of his writing, he also seems to have given up in telling a complete story.  All he does is make things more complicated and doesn't resolve much by the end of the story.  For any true fan of science fiction - a person who has read the masters of the genre - this work seems only to have one purpose:  to make other books seem better in comparison.<br />If you wish to read good alien invasion stories by real writers, try &quot;The Visitors&quot; by Clifford Simak, &quot;Footfall&quot; by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, &quot;The Monitors&quot; by Keith Laumer, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; by Jack Finney or &quot;Childhood's End&quot; by Arthur Clarke.

Unfortunately, the Kidd novels have never been on the same par as the Davenport books.<br />Part of the problem is that Kidd isn't as well-defined as Davenport, and Luanne is even hazier.  Also, Kidd's semi-omniscience (every fact he needs seems to be just a few computer clicks away), master thieving skills and financial security make him just a little too perfect; it is the human characteristics that make a character interesting and drives the story.<br />All this would reduce the story to four stars, but the other problem here is the story itself.  While not bad, it is not as interesting as others.  The villain, in particular, is a pale shadow of some of the true nasties that have occupied the Prey novels.	2001-11-14

As Boorstin runs through his list of influential artists, there are gaps that show the impossibility of doing his subject complete justice.<br />Essentially a collection of short biographies, Boorstin does a fine job introducing the reader to the writers, painters, musicians and others he has chosen as principal creators in art.  Each biography not only gives details of the artists but also describes the artists' major works and why they are so important.  This is not a quick read, but it is both entertaining and educational.<br />The main flaw in this work is some noticeable errors that injure Boorstin's credibility in presenting other information.  Although it is hard to fault Boorstin for neglecting certain people or subjects (I am sure space was a consideration), there were certain things I wish he would have dwelt on more, such as cinema (and to a lesser extent, television) and modern music forms such as jazz and rock.  <br />Flaws aside, this is a good book and a good way to be introduced to a lot of the influences in the world of art.	2001-11-10

Nonetheless, this is not a good book.<br />As always, the problem is with his talking heads (in better works, these would be known as characters).  There is no chemistry between any of these people, not even the protagonists of Turcotte and Duncan, who have apparently become lovers without any explanation (other than the fact that they are the protagonists).  Once again, Duncan indicates she has a son, but within a couple pages, the kid is gone again.  The world is threatened with plague and invasion, yet she doesn't even think of her family.  <br />The story does move ahead more smoothly than The Reply, but so much is left unresolved, you can tell Doherty is in this for the long haul.  This is the most cynical sort of writer:  it is obvious that he is in this only for the money, since there is no real sense of creativity here:  this is only a ludicrous explanation for some Weekly World News-style mysteries, cobbled together with one-dimensional characters and a superficial knowledge of technology and science.

To a large extent, he still is.  When you pick up a Ludlum book, you know what you will get:  a fast and entertaining read with a Cold War good vs. evil mentality.  With his international intrigue, superspy characters and constant action, his writing is closer to a James Bond movie than even Ian Fleming's books.<br />The problem with Ludlum is the same thing as his strength: you know what you're going to get.  There are characters dying immediately after revealing a single clue and other characters appearing at the magic moment to save the day.  The protagonist, Nick Bryson, is so talented both physically and mentally, it limits the sense of danger he faces...he is no ordinary guy.<br />This one probably rates just above three stars; I'd give it three-and-a-half if I could.

None of the characters have any depth, so there is no sense of menace when they are threatened.  The chemistry between the characters is minimal and they seem unable to talk of anything other than the aliens.  One principal character (Lisa Duncan) has a child who is mentioned once and then completely disregarded.  How can we believe any of these characters are more than talking heads?<br />I don't actually have much of a problem with the outlandish plot; as ludicrous as this alien conspiracy is, I feel that in the hands of a talented writer, this could actually be good.  I do find amusing the paradox that Doherty presents:  humanity is apparently not bright enough to build the Pyramids, Easter Island statues or Great Wall of China (second book), or develop a nuclear weapon unassisted, yet it will be brilliant enough to actually defeat the aliens.<br />Amazingly, there is just enough entertainment value in these books to rate two stars.  The main value in these books, however, is to show how a science fiction book should not be written.	2001-11-02

Like all good vows, it should be an ordeal to actually live up to the promise, and this definitely fits into the good vow category.<br />Doherty has obviously figured out that he can exploit an audience that believes in UFOs and government conspiracies.  The other similar exploiters of these people range in the quality spectrum from the X-Files (good) to the Weekly World News (bad).  The Area 51 books tend to the latter part of this spectrum.<br />Once again, Doherty's biggest problem is his paper-thin characters.  Weak characters make for weak suspense, and the dangers that Turcotte and company face become ho-hum.  When a principal &quot;character&quot; dies, there is no feeling behind it.  While there are vague hints of potential romance between Turcotte and Duncan, the hints are so vague, they are laughable.  It makes for the sci-fi equivalent of a porn movie, where character and dialogue are just distractions to move the action along.<br />Soon enough, it'll be on to book three.  I just hope it isn't a chore like the first two.  Fulfilling these vows are a challenge.	2001-11-02

This novel shows the potential of a great author.<br />Altman is not quite there yet, and maybe he never will be.  Only future books will tell.  This book is good, however.  You do not expect deep thoughts from a work like this, just good entertainment, and he pays off.<br />Why not five stars?  Because there are still things that need to be worked on.  In particular, the ending seems a bit abrupt and depends on a slight deus ex machina to save a principal character (to avoid spoilers, I say no more on this).  Also, the two story lines could mesh together better.<br />In the end, however, this one is worth reading and I anticipate reading more Altman in the future.	2001-10-31
US	43083835	R271F2EO0EAMVP	0743204301	975528807	Nothing Like It In The World: The Men Who Built the Trancontinental Railroad, 1863-1869	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Rambling yet interesting	I give Ambrose the benefit of the doubt by giving this book three stars...two-and-a-half would probably be more accurate.<br />While the story of the transcontinental railroad is interesting, and Ambrose does convey a sense of how limited transportation was in the early nineteenth century, this book does have flaws.  Besides some actual errors, Ambrose's style gets rather grating.  He has a tendency to get a bit florid in his writing.  In addition, neither of his parallel narratives are told in a linear fashion, which I feel this sort of history requires;  he moves back and forth in time, so often one chapter starts a year or more prior to where the previous related chapter left off.<br />I also have Ambrose's Eisenhower biography, which I have yet to read, but I must admit that reading this one as lowered my expectations for that biography.  I hope that this book is an aberration in his writing.	2001-10-28
US	43083835	R3NCW9TOZE69WS	0671047329	644541461	The Third Option	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Decent suspenser	This is a fast and fun read; it isn't great literature, but then again, it's not trying to be.<br />The main flaw is - without giving away too much - there is no complete resolution.  It obviously is designed to make you read the next in the series.  Unless it is clearly indicated (for example, &quot;Volume 1 in the XYZ Trilogy,&quot;) I find such an ending to be manipulative and a cheat.  It seems like the ploy of an author who feels his next book would never be bought on its own merits so he needs to resort to trickery and is willing to force his loyal reader to commit for months or years to a book he really only wanted to give a few days to.<br />Flynn's good enough that he doesn't need to do such things.  To me, it is an indication of fellow suspense writer's James Patterson's diminishing abilities that he can't stop doing similar tricks.  But that's a different rant....	2001-10-04
US	43083835	R2V455RIBPBYKS	0345413881	621917476	Dr. Death (Alex Delaware)	Books	2	7	7	N	N	A series on the wane	For the past few Delaware books, the structure has been tediously similar:  Alex (with or without Milo) goes from person to person and asks questions.  Eventually, he figures out who the killer is, there is a single action scene and then it ends.<br />Alex is getting to be less and less of a character.  His girlfriend serves almost no purpose to the story, not even as a sounding board.  In this story, even the concluding action scene is pretty minor, and in the only other scene of any real violence, Alex is threatened with no more than a sore jaw.<br />Billy Straight shows that Kellerman still knows what he's doing, but the Delaware books seem to just go through the motions.  It's time for either rebirth or retirement for this series.	2001-09-07

In a way, the whole set seems to be the story of a country growing up and the end is kind of a happy arrival in adulthood.  It is interesting to read an &quot;outsider's&quot; view of American history, however.	2001-07-27
US	43083835	RFKNLISNT3TLM	0679403922	788319158	The Cold Six Thousand	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Even Weak Ellroy Beats Most Other Writers	One way I break fiction writers into categories is &quot;Wait Till Paperback,&quot; &quot;Wait till Used Paperback&quot; or &quot;Don't Bother.&quot;  Ellroy has been one of the very few to meet that elite category &quot;Buy Immediately In Hardcover.&quot;  Although this is not his best work, he will remain in this category.<br />As Ellroy evolves as a writer, he gets more stylistic.  On the one hand, this distinguishes his skills from a number of other fiction writers; on the other hand, it takes a while to get used to.  Think of watching Monty Python for the first time...it takes a little while to get used to accents (at least as a Californian)(wow, Monty Python and James Ellroy in a comparison...who'd figure).<br />The constant use of short, simple sentences in the narrative is initially grating but creates a freneticism that a less stylized use of language might not.  All the characters, even the &quot;good guys,&quot; are corrupt; they just differ in degrees and types of corruption.  This makes for a very dark and chaotic view of the world, where people strive for drops of happiness in an ocean of hopelessness.<br />Ellroy remains as intense and compelling as ever.  If I don't consider this his best story, it's still pretty damn good.  I was torn between four and five stars for this review; in the end, I opted for five to offset some of the more negative reviews.	2001-07-22
US	43083835	R13CFE9I3E03OD	1551668246	870830835	A Perfect Evil (Maggie O'Dell)	Books	1	4	8	N	N	A Perfect Cliche	It amazes me that so many people seem to have enjoyed this book while I can't even understand why it got published; there is absolutely nothing in this book that hasn't been done better elsewhere.<br />Off the top of my head, some noteworthy flaws: (1) A lack of suspense: the killer is revealed early on and you can see every &quot;twist&quot; a mile away (the killer kidnaps young boys, a main character has a young nephew, so guess who gets kidnaped?).  (2) A non-ending a la James Patterson designed to force the reader to buy the next book. (3) Every principal character is ruggedly handsome or exquisitely beautiful, with plenty of romance-novel adjectives to describe them; even the principal male character's name, Nick, has a certain cliched feel to it.  (4) Even the baggage each character carries (everyone is either physically or emotionally abused or both) is tedious.<br />The best that can be said about this novel is it makes you appreciate other books more; for decent (or better) suspense novels, try Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly, Ridley Pearson, John Sanford, Nelson Demille or a couple dozen others.	2001-07-17
