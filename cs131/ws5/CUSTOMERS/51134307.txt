It's a long book, but that's because there are so many great stories to tell of what working people accomplished in the 1930s and 40s.  If you go by what you learn in school, you would think that anything workers ever got in this country is due to the generosity of Franklin Roosevelt. But this book shows how workers had to overcome the resistance of the \\"liberal\\" Roosevelt on many fronts, from the fraud of the NRA to the Minneapolis Teamster trials to FDR's open strikebreaking before and during World War II.  Another amazing thing about this story is that, as the author explains, most people thought the labor movement was dead in the water right before this huge upsurge happened that created the CIO. It is a good lesson for today to remind us that big battles are coming and that workers can win.	2004-06-27

Bosses produce essentially nothing. The profits that bosses make are stolen from the workers  This is a central insight of Marxist economics that this book does a good job of  explaining.  It also has an interesting discussion of \\"neo-capitalism\\" which is the form of capitalism that arose after World War II--capitalism that needed massive government intervention to survive.  Mandel shows how war spending allows capitalism to avoid major depressions and how social programs blunt the effects of economic crisis on the workers, and thereby postpone revolutionary situations.  It's especially interesting to read this book now, thirty years after it was written, since it makes a point of saying that the post-World War II prosperity would not last forever. It didn't and we've now entered a period of history where world economic depression, the rise of fascist movements, and attacks on social programs like welfare, social security, unemployment compensation, etc. are the norm.  Mandel's book helps make sense of this miserable system so that we can chart a way forward to destroy it.	2003-12-26

The Socialist Workers Party and Young Socialist Alliance, known then as Trotskyists, were eager to do so.  Whereas the Trotskyists appreciated Malcolm's politics and publicized his speeches in the Militant newspaper and later through Pathfinder Press, the Stalinized Communist Party was hostile to Black nationalism.  This book does a great job of showing how Trotsky helped lead his supporters in the US to a proper appreciation of the importance of viewing Blacks as an oppressed nation within the US.  In the 1930s, the largely white and better-paid workers in the Socialist Workers Party found it difficult to see clearly how important the question of the oppression of Blacks was.  They tended to assume that once capitalism was overthrown, racism would just fade away. It took Bolshevik leaders from thousands of miles away to set them on the right course.  Trotsky argued that Blacks had to decide for themselves what their destiny would be as an oppressed nation, just as the Bolsheviks supported the right of oppressed peoples within former Czarist Russia to self-determination. As the result of conversations between US revolutionaries and Trotsky, when Malcolm X came along, over twenty years later, these revolutionaries were ready to join hands with him.	2003-11-21

Originalmente, el texto fue la introducion de un libro por economista cubana Carlos Tablada que es sobre el pensamiento economico de Che.  Tablada y Mary-Alice Waters en su panfleto muestran que, en los primeros anos de la revolucion, la practica de trabajo voluntario fue central para Che.  Explican, tambien, que en los anos 80, la direccion de la revolucion cubana se dio cuenta que el partido necesito empezar un proceso de rectificacion para coregir muchos errores que resultaron de copiar el sistema de la union sovietica durante los anos 70.  Y describen como los cubanos volvieron a las ideas de che sobre trabajo voluntario que es esencial para que la gente trabajador pueda desarrollar una consciencia communista.  Esta idea, realiza por la revolucion cubana, es una inspiracion a nosotros que estamos luchando por la justicia y contra el imperialismo hoy en todas partes del mundo.	2003-10-02

It tells the amazing story of the Russian revolution of 1917, from the overthrow of the Czar to the Bolshevik Revolution of October.  What makes it an incredible read is that the author, Leon Trotsky, was at the middle of it all, as one of the central planners of the insurrection that took power.  Trotsky was a great revolutionary and great writer. But one thing I especially like about the book is that Trotsky uses excerpts from many other accounts, including those who hated him with a passion, to tell the story accurately.  It is an inspiring story, especially for new generations of young people, workers and farmers who need to learn about an example showing that the dog-eat-dog system of capitalism we live in can be overthrown.  For the definitive account of how this great revolution was later derailed, see Trotsky's Revolution Betrayed.	2003-05-07

Cannon writings & speeches)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The second interimperialist slaughter	We are commonly told that World War II was the good war.  That maybe Vietnam was bad, but in World War II, the US was fighting against fascism and for freedom.  This book will force anyone to reexamine that view and come to a more realistic idea of what the second World War  was all about--groups of imperialist countries fighting to redivide the markets, raw materials and territory of the world.  The record of the SWP in that war shows just how far the US government was willing to go to silence dissent--leaders of the party who were influential in building up the Teamsters union in Minnesota were imprisoned; and the partys newspaper was banned from the mails.  Despite this, as James Cannon shows, the party never abandoned its principles and actually succeeded in gaining members as the war dragged on.  This is a fine example to all people today as the US drags us to war in Iraq in the name of freedom and fighting terrorism.	2003-03-15

Trotsky's writings show that Marxism is far from being a sterile set of formulas which relegate art, literature, music, love, and our emotional lives to the sidelines, in favor of  economics.  No, the book shows that Marxist ideas are so powerful because they can illuminate the complex connections between economic structures and the varied human creativity expressed in all forms of art.  It also takes a strong stand against censorship and for freedom, not only in capitalist societies, but in post-capitalist ones, such as the Soviet Union, where Stalinists had made a mockery of artistic freedom in the name of socialism.  These ideas are illustarted by a fascinating set of writings, including literary reviews, correspondence with artists like Andre Breton and analysis of the challenges facing artists and writers in the Soviet Union.	2003-03-15

After all, in the end, Eastern Airlines was forced out of business and Eastern workers lost their jobs. But the beauty of this book is it shows just how much the strikers at Eastern accomplished in their battle with Frank Lorenzo and his attempt to de-unionize the airline industry.  It shows how the Eastern strikers reached out in solidarity to other workers, including coal miners at Pittston Coal, who were also on strike.  And it shows that despite a Machinists union top leadership, which had accepted concession after concession from Eastern, the rank- and-file workers in Miami and New York and other cities were able to wage an impressive fight against Lorenzo and finally drive him out of the airline business.  The book also has a great collection of photos from the strike as well as a very helpful detailed chronology.  This book tells the real story of this strike.  Don't miss it!	2003-03-13

I'll tell you why. Because this book explains like no other book I've ever read what actually happened in the Soviet Union between the original Bolshevik Revolution and its total degeneration under the Stalinist bureaucracy; and WHY it happened.  With plenty of concrete detail, it explains that Stalin and his henchmen took over the Russian Revolution NOT because revolutions are always bound to fail; and not because people are inherently corrupt; or that socialism is doomed.  But because of a specific set of historical circumstances that faced the young Soviet workers' state and overwhelmed it.  From this situation came Stalin and his fake version of Marxism, which Trotsky does a great job of blowing apart.  For anyone who believes that there must be a better way than the dog-eat-dog system of capitalism that we live in, read this book!	2003-03-13

In contrast to the George Bush the elder's boast that the US was leading us all into a \\"New World Order\\" of peace and prosperity, the perspective here is a sober and realistic one: the US is leading the world toward economic depression, a renewal of fascist movements, and if the working class does not take power, World War III. This assessment was based on a series of events, including the gigantic stock market crash of 1987.  Preventing World War III, and all that would accompany it, is the challenge facing working people around the world and we need to organize NOW to make sure this is not our future.  In light of this, this issue of New International includes an extremely informative article on Cuba, which shows that despite the \\"Special Period\\" they were living through, without aid from the Soviet Union, the Cubans were still fighting for a socialist society and because they refused to bow down to capitalist America, they continued to be a thorn in the side of the US.  All of this is even more true today, as the stock market bubble of the 1990s has now decisively burst. And what is most striking today is how the jockeying for position heading into the war with Iraq is showing just what this article said: that competition between \\"allies\\" within  NATO would sharpen.  Just look at all the anti-French and German propaganda going around right now and you'll see just how accurate this set of articles was and still is today.	2003-03-13

This collection of essays by one of the leading revolutionaries of the 20th century provides a much-needed critical perspective on terrorism.  Not from a moralizing point of view, but to show that by relying on individual heroic acts of violence like assassinations of government leaders, terrorist tactics ignore and devalue the masses of people as the most important agent of their own liberation.  Though his examples are drawn from Hapsburg Austria, Tsarist Russia and Nazi Germany, when you read his words, you can easily see the relevance to liberation struggles taking place today from Palestine to Ireland to the Philippines.  I especially like the way that Trotsky sympathizes with the hatred of the gross injustice that breeds terrorism, but at the same time explains that individual terrorist tactics are doomed to fail.	2003-01-31

In the US, too, people who strongly criticize the State of Israel are accused of anti-Semitism. Sometimes, as in the case of right-wing outfits like the National Alliance, it's true-they do hate Jews.  But are all anti-Zionists also anti-Jewish?  This question was posed sharply in the early 1970s, when the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League launched a public attack on left-wing opponents of Zionism, including the Socialist Workers Party and Young Socialist Alliance.  This pamphlet does a great job of answering these charges.  It shows how the SWP opposed Zionism but also fought energetically in the 1930s to open US borders to Jewish refugees from Nazi terror in Europe, and to politically isolate fascists in the US.  I particularly like the section showing how the Franklin Roosevelt administration did practically nothing for Jews, while mainstream Zionist Jewish groups, including B'nai B'rith, SUPPORTED this policy, and even counseled Jews to stay away from anti-fascist demonstrations.  All of this while Hitler was killing Jews.  Anyone concerned about the fate of the Jews and how to combat anti-Semitism should read this book.	2003-01-31

When he wrote this book, the Six Days War of 1967 had just ended, with Israel gobbling up the territory of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories they occupy to this day. One major war and two intifadas later, the Palestinian people have refused to give up their fight against the Zionist state.  Rodinson&#146;s book is still essential reading if you want to understand why Palestinians and other Arab peoples hate the government of Israel.  The book does a great job of showing why Israel is essentially a result of colonialism--even with its unique features.  And it is especially good at anticipating and answering counter-arguments to this position.  This makes it an excellent weapon in the debates over this subject today, as the U.S. is preparing to launch a war with Iraq, which will bring the Palestinian question to the center of world politics.	2002-10-27

It explains that racism does not persist because of ignorant, uneducated white people, but because the capitalist rulers of America find racism too useful and profitable to part with.  To prove this thesis, Camejo goes into fascinating detail about how Radical Reconstruction began to transform the American south, as Blacks, armed with guns and the right to vote, began to direct their own destiny.  He then shows how the Republican Party abandoned Blacks as the Party consolidated its economic grip on the south, and \\"reconstructed\\" it in their own capitalist image.  His analysis of the \\"Myth of the 1877 Compromise,\\" which historians have mystified for so many years, is particularly helpful.  Finally, Camejo does a great job of showing how and why other historians have failed to explain these truths clearly to generations of students.  Don't miss this book!!!	2002-10-27

He was a first-class revolutionary who fought for decades for his country's freedom and always believed in the power of the masses of people to make change.  This book is so inspiring because you read Mandela in his own words, starting as a student leader in the 1940s to a leader of the African National Congress's armed wing in the 1960s to an internationally known political prisoner in the 1980s.  He never gave up and he outlasted the vicious apartheid system.  The photos in the book also do a great job of showing what the struggle against apartheid was like.	2002-08-26

This issue of New International tells the story of how the deep-going and popular revolution which came to power in Grenada in 1979, led by Maurice Bishop, was destroyed from within by a Stalinist faction within the ruling New Jewel Movement.  When the US invaded Grenada in October of 1983, the revolution was already dead at the hands of Bernard Coard and his associates.  This is extremely important to understand because you can easily get the idea that any small country that dares to defy the power of the American empire will always go down to defeat.  The invasion of Grenada was certainly a big blow to the liberation struggle in Grenada, but learning the lessons of how the defeat could have been avoided, and understanding the deadly role of Stalinism within Grenada, will make it more possible to succeed the next time around.<br />Aside from the title article on Grenada, the issue has a fantastic piece on the sordid history of US government spying and disruption campaigns against labor, civil rights and revolutionary movements; and how, with the right strategy, we can defeat and expose such efforts, as was done in a landmark lawsuit won by the Socialist Workers Party against the FBI in 1987.	2002-08-26

You can actually understand what he's saying.  He makes a serious effort to reach average people. And he has a clear sense of how philosophical issues are related to the fight to change the world.  This is not surprising since he was a longtime leader of the Socialist Workers Party and this book is part of a series he wrote to explain how dialectical materialism or Marxism emerged from earlier materialistic philosophies.  That's one of the things I like about his approach.  He doesn't just say that empiricism was inadequate, so Marxism came along to take its place.  He does say that; but he explains what was useful and, for its time, revolutionary about empiricism.  And then he goes to show how changes in social relations and in natural scientific discoveries made empiricism obsolete.  So that what we call \\"common sense\\" is not enough to understand the world and organize ourselves to change it.  Think about that and read it-a clear analysis and debunking of common sense.	2002-08-26

Ancient history?  The Nicaraguan Revolution went down to defeat, Stalinism fell apart in Europe; but really, not  a lot has changed.  The US is at war in Afghanistan; it's threatening war again in Iraq; and now we have Bush's \\"axis of evil,\\" just a slight change in wording.  Once again, many progressive-minded people are confronting the question: how do you end war?  This article gives a clear answer to this question which exposes a lot of the fake answers out there, such as, elect a Democratic President instead of a Republican; campaign for \\"peace,\\" in general; or lobby Congressmen to stop producing more nuclear weapons.  The article explains that the only road to lasting peace will be a working-class revolution worldwide.  Anything short of placing the world's working-class majority at the center of this strategy is bound to fail.  As the Enron and other scandals further erode many workers' faith in capitalism and as they begin to mobilize to defend their interests, the message of this book is more relevant than ever.	2002-08-26

These are questions that have vexed human beings ever since they began to think.  They are also questions most people figure they don't really need to spend time thinking about.  But George Novack, who was a serious student of philosophy and a leader of the Socialist Workers Party for many years, does a great job of explaining just how relevant these basic questions are to ordinary people who want to change the world.  What makes this book so helpful is that it does not assume the reader is an academic philosopher.  The book looks at the evolution in ancient Greece and Rome of a materialistic outlook, which began to understand that human beings could make sense of the world without relying on ideas of god and the supernatural.  He shows how and why the Greeks in particular made incredible advances in thinking which were shunted aside, only to be rediscovered more than a thousand years later by later materialistic thinkers in Europe during the Renaissance.  You will understand more about these ideas in reading this book than by reading twenty academic tomes on philosophy.  Save your money and buy this one.	2002-08-26

This book, which was originally an issue of New International, was written at a time when revolutions had recently taken power in Nicaragua, Grenada and Iran and this question was posed in a very direct way.  In the first two cases, they were led by parties who were oriented to mobilizing the power of workers and farmers to move forward to socialism.  And all of this happened in the shadow of the 1959 revolution in Cuba.  The articles in this issue are by revolutionaries in Cuba, Nicaragua and the US, all taking stock of what had happened.  The lead article by Mary Alice Waters does an especially good job of taking the long view and seeing how previous generations of revolutionaries, starting with Marx and Engels during the Paris Commune of 1871 and through the Bolsheviks in Russia, looked at this question and built the only type of government which could move forward at the head of such a revolution-a workers and farmers government.  The article places Cuba and Nicaragua in this longterm perspective and shows what revolutionaries have learned both from their mistakes and their successes.	2002-08-26

He spent a quarter century behind bars in US prisons for his actions, which included taking part in an armed protest in the US Capitol building in 1954.  Nearly fifty years after that happened, he's still fighting and now there is a new generation of Puerto Ricans who are interested in his message.  This pamphlet is not about the past, but about the present and future.  One of the interviews with Rafael Cancel Miranda took place in 1998 as tens of thousands of workers for the state-owned Puerto Rican telephone company were on a 41-day strike, to protest selling the company to US big business.  This sparked a 2-day general strike throughout the island.  As these events and his ideas show, Puerto Rican nationalism is not dead.  The second interview, done earlier in the year,  gives a lot of helpful information about Miranda's own family background, how he became a rebel, and what his imprisonment was like.  He explains that his first protest was at the age of six when he refused to say the pledge of allegiance to the US flag.  This pamphlet also does a nice job of showing how the fight for Puerto Rican independence is tied up with workers struggles worldwide, including those in Cuba.	2002-07-20

Malcolm X explains clearly, and often in a humorous way, how knowing the truth about your history is necessary for building a movement to tear down racism and build a better society.  The heart of the book is a speech that Malcolm gave less than a month before his death.  His point is that Black people have to become aware of their true accomplishments in the past in order to change the world in the present and future.  By looking at ancient African civilizations, West African kingdoms, the rise of imperialism and the history of slavery in America, Malcolm shows that Black people have played a huge role in shaping human history.  Even though he spoke at a time when Black History Month was still Black History Week, his message is still totally relevant as African-Americans still face the challenge of leading a movement that can end police brutality, racist violence, political oppression and economic exploitation, while joining up with working people and the oppressed around the world.  The impact of Malcolm's speech is magnified by his own explanation of how he studied Black history while in prison; and by a nice set of graphics and maps which illustrate his points.	2002-07-20

The author, Farrell Dobbs, was born into a working-class family in Missouri in 1907, worked his way into a management job, started his own business, and hoped to go to law school and become a judge.  But his plans were cut short by the great depression of the 1930s.  In 1933,  he found himself working in a Minneapolis coal yard and met coworkers who asked  him to join an effort to organize the workers into a branch of the Teamsters union.  The rest is history.  In 1934, Dobbs played a central role as the members of Teamsters Local 574 carried out a series of three dramatic strikes that succeeded in making Minneapolis a union town.  To do this, they had to battle the boss-led Citizens Alliance, the police, the top Teamster bureaucrats, as well as a &quot;friend of labor&quot; Governor, who talked out of both sides of his mouth.  This book gives a blow-by-blow account of all of this, and is a real handbook for how to conduct a strike effectively.  Key to their victory was a union leadership that included members of the Communist League of America, a revolutionary socialist group, which later became the Socialist Workers Party, which Dobbs joined and led on a national level for decades.  If you like this book, you'll also want to read the three other books in Dobbs' Teamster series, Teamster Power, Teamster Politics and Teamster Bureaucracy.	2002-07-02

That includes a history of the first Intifada against the Israeli occupation, starting in 1987.  And it makes it very clear that the fighting going on today is not because of \\"ancient hatreds\\" that people are born with.  It shows how the major imperialist countries, including the UK, France and the United States, have blood on their hands and are responsible for much of the misery that the Arab peoples have lived with for the last century.  It also shows that the Palestinian people are capable of organizing a political movement that can point the way forward to a democratic, secular Palestine.  This is an inspiring piece of work.	2002-07-02

Men are supposedly bound by their genetic makeup to be the stronger, dominant sex.  Women are allegedly destined by biology to be the weaker sex.  If you are looking for evidence against this argument, look no further.  Evelyn Reed, who was a feminist, socialist and anthropologist, provides a mountain of evidence about early human societies, which shows that, without a doubt, women have not always been subordinate to men.  In painstaking, shocking and sometimes even humorous detail, she reconstructs the prehistoric matriarchal societies that spanned the globe thousands of years ago.  She draws on myths, anthropological studies of modern-day \\"primitive\\" peoples, and even Greek dramas to show that it took a long and bloody period of evolution for the \\"father-family\\" to develop and for women to become subordinated to men.  I particularly like her chapter on women's \\"productive record,\\" which shows that women, because of their cooperative social organization, invented human civilization, including farming, industry and even the use of fire.	2002-05-10

What makes this book special is how it combines a serious musical analysis of jazz-as in the chapter on Elvin Jones' drumming-with an understanding of the social and political dimensions of the music-as in the piece on jazz as a weapon of the Cold War.  Kofsky takes on a range of music critics to argue the case for considering jazz as distinctively Black music.  And he shows how John Coltrane and his collaborators had to fight to maintain their musical integrity in a business dominated by white critics, promoters, club owners and the like.  Occasionally, the book reads like a personal vendetta by Kofsky against particular jazz critics, which is distracting. But for anyone who wants to understand better the connections between jazz music and the politics of the 1960s, this is a very useful book.	2002-04-11

It shows quite convincingly how World War II, contrary to the recent hoopla over Tom Hanks and Saving Private Ryan, was anything but &quot;the good war.&quot;  Author Farrell Dobbs was an elected local Teamsters leader, who had helped spearhead organizing drives which built the union into a major power in the midwest during the 1930s.  Dobbs was also a leader of the Socialist Workers Party, which gained a lot of influence in the labor movement in Minneapolis; and which openly opposed the US entry into World War II.  Dobbs and his fellow Teamster and Socialist activists had to fight the combined might of the national Teamster bureaucrats, the local trucking bosses and the Roosevelt Administration, who succeeded in putting Dobbs and others on trial for sedition.  The defendants were the first to be tried under the 1940 Smith Act, later used widely against members of the Communist Party.  The defendants were also charged with violating an old law passed in 1861 to target the Confederacy, which had never been used.  Though the defendants were convicted and spent time in federal prison, the book shows how they put up an excellent public defense and won many supporters.  Especially in conjunction with Dobbs' two earlier installments in the series, this is book well worth reading.	2002-03-04
