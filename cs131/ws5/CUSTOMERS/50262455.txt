Amazingly, a great many people in this country would answer 'yes' to that. Mr. Scheuer's livelihood was made as a CIA analyst who studied the Middle East. With the type of information he had access to, he relates how US foreign policy vis--vis the Middle East has affected the opinions -- and the lives -- of Arabs.  <br /> <br />Mr. Sheuer says, and rightly so, that bin Laden has been quite consistent in his reasons for waging war on the West, and the US in particular, and those reasons have nothing whatever to do with \\"hating freedom\\" or wanting to \\"destroy Western culture\\". Mr. Scheuer predicts a protracted, bloody struggle -- unless there's a change in US foreign policy (and, so far, we have seen no indication of that). I suppose many in this country would say that Scheuer is just another person who \\"blames America first\\"; these would be the same people who \\"don't care what the Muslims think\\". Mr. Scheuer provides great insight into \\"why we are hated\\".  <br /> <br />I thought that some of his remedies contradicted positions he took earlier in the book, and he does make some blanket assertions that I think aren't right but, overall, this book is a must-read for those who truly want to understand the roots of Islamic terrorism.	2005-02-22

I know I'm echoing some of the other reviews here, but I just couldn't put this book down! I've never been a big fan of Franken's, but he's a pretty good writer I'd have to say. <br /> <br />Franken goes after some of the big \\"talking heads\\" of the right -- Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity; he mentions Rush Limbaugh too, but he already devoted an entire book to him. <br /> <br />I think most will enjoy Franken's fictional Vietnam story. I haven't laughed that well in a while! The \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" made some good points too. <br /> <br />Of course, the main thrust of the work was to expose how right-wing pundits aren't 'purveyors of truth'. Franken is at his best in dissecting the statements of Sean Hannity, the over-the-top hysterics of Ann Coulter, and the 'spin' that Bill O'Reilly actually puts into his show. I would certainly recommend this book to fans of these three -- if only to discover how you're being taken.	2005-01-06

The book is listed at 448 pages, but that includes over 100 pages of references/notes. Mr. Bovard is very meticulous and appeared, at least to me, to be just laying out as many facts as he could, then letting the reader draw their own conclusions. There's a great deal in here that may surprise you -- maybe even rub you the wrong way if you're a strong supporter of the current administration. The chapter \\"Iraq and the War on Terror\\" is very insightful and timely, in light of what is currently going on over there. Again, Bovard doesn't prescribe any remedy -- he leaves that to the reader. You owe to yourself to become more knowledgeable about the policies our government has engaged in/is engaged in -- in our name -- around the world, and what effect, if any, the current policies to address terrorism may or may not have.	2004-04-05

Chomsky's commentary can be summed up as this, I think: while the American people didn't 'have this coming', our country's hands certainly aren't clean. <br />Chomsky details the shady alliances our government has made in the past, most notably with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, who now of course are our mortal enemies. We helped both of these individuals with training and technology, something that doesn't get much emphasis on television. <br />I think one of the more salient points Chomsky makes is that we (the US) believe we have the freedom to act any way we wish, and that the rules (of the so-called 'international community') don't really apply to us, even though we say we support them. International law, Chomsky says, should apply to all states -- as well it should.<br />Conservative talk radio likes to dismiss people like Chomsky as left wing ideologues who &quot;hate America&quot;. Read this book and judge for yourself. I don't agree with everything Chomsky says, but his arguments are certainly well thought out. His responses are, in my mind, better than what we've gotten as the official reasons for the attacks from our government, viz., that these people are just &quot;evil&quot;, or that they &quot;hate our freedom&quot;. At least Chomsky doesn't insult your intelligence.	2003-07-13

The Rosberg's use many examples from real-life couples they've either counseled in Dr. Rosberg's practice, or people they've met in life or through their radio show, &quot;America's Family Coaches Live&quot;. It's through the radio show that I found out about this book. As I wrote in my title, I wish I'd had this 20 years ago. My own marriage is strong, but it could have been so much sooner if I'd been told some of the truths in here. Biblically-based, the book can help you wherever you are on the &quot;marriage map&quot;, as the Rosberg's call it.

Well, Professor Hoppe explains many of the &quot;downsides&quot; of Democracy, and proposes another form of &quot;government&quot;. I think that, like any form of government, democracy looks a lot better on paper than it does in real life. Hoppe attributes this to praxeology (a word he uses quite often) - the study of human action and conduct. In other words, democracy might be okay were it not for the nature of man.<br />I'm not sure whether what Hoppe proposes as a better form, anarcho-capitalism, would be any better, as you would still have man in the equation. But certainly, as Hoppe mentions, the democracies of the West are quickly morphing into socialism, and most people in this country don't even realize this. This trend towards socialism, Hoppe says, will crush Western democracies with the weight of their debt. Other symptoms/maladies that seem to go along with modern democracy include &quot;forced integration&quot; and &quot;egalitarianism&quot;.<br />I agree with another reviewer in that the first section of the book on time-preference is hard to follow, but becomes clearer once Hoppe starts to make his case against democracy. I would recommend &quot;fans&quot; of democracy read this book. It will help you see the shortcomings and perhaps ways that it can be improved (though Hoppe believes that improvement is not possible - it has to be pulled up by the roots).	2003-02-04

Men truly need women, as the author writes, to \\"socialize and civilize\\" them. Without the influence of women, men are left to their own devices, and become slaves to their passions, which generally results in what would be termed \\"anti-social\\" behavior. \\"Radical feminism\\" is not good for this country, or any other. Rather than trying to make the sexes \\"equal\\", we should appreciate the differences. The author notes it is these differences that make society \\"work\\".

I thought Buchanan scored his best points when talking about the culture war, not racial issues. The \\"Death of the West\\" is as much cultural, if not more so, than racial.<br />If you're on the \\"wrong side\\" of the current culture war (i.e., you're politically incorrect), you might be subject to this kind of attack: \\"Members and front organizations must continually embarrass, discredit, and degrade our critics. When obstructionists become too irritating, label them fascist, or Nazi, or anti-Semite... . The association will, after enough repetition, become \\"fact\\" in the public mind.\\" Sounds a lot like current attacks on people like Buchanan, doesn't it? That quote comes from the Moscow Central Committee in 1943. <br />How about this, which could be an indictment of Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson: \\"There is a class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\\" The speaker was Booker T. Washington.<br />I don't believe that Buchanan wants to see America \\"lily-white\\", as one reviewer put it. What America has to come to grips with is this: that the United States started out as a predominately white, Christian country. It remained that way for over 150 years. The Founders never intended for this country to be multi-racial, much less multi-cultural. That is an idea of recent vintage.<br />The problem with the current wave of immigration, as Buchanan documents, is that they are less likely to assimilate than previous waves. He gives a couple reasons for this. Political advantage is one- which party can give out \\"the goodies\\" to buy votes. Another is the current idea that all cultures are equally valid, and can and should be accommodated in the US. This is a prescription for chaos.<br />The final question on the back of the book is \\"Is the America we grew up in gone forever?\\" If you're under the age of 30, you'll probably be scratching your head and saying \\"What's he talking about?\\" This is because you are too young to remember the \\"old\\" America. I would say that \\"that\\" America has passed into history, and a new one has been born. The writing is on the wall, and it appears that we're headed down the path every great empire has followed to its demise.	2002-08-18

The words used are carefully selected in order that the listener or reader will form certain opinions about the subject. This is by design. <br />Now, while total objectivity is probably not achievable, McGowan suggests that at least we ought to strive for it. His book explores how certain aspects on important issues of the day: abortion, \\"gay rights\\", immigration, etc., get left out of the debate because they contradict the viewpoint the news organization in question is trying to promote. McGowan says, and quite rightly so, that this is a tremendous disservice to viewers/readers.<br />The ideas put forth in this book were really no surprise to me; anyone with a discerning eye/ear can readily perceive the slant the major news media give to certain \\"sensitive\\" issues. McGowan concludes with an exhortation to the media to be more frank and upfront with the public, but don't hold your breath. He says the palpable one-sidedness of coverage by the major media is the main reson for the explosive growth in \\"conservative\\" talk radio, and for internet news sites as well.<br />Though not an exhaustive work, this book should pique your interest to do some research on your own to validate its claims.	2002-08-03

One thing that comes through loud and clear after reading this book is that virtually every problem that one sees in our current government started under Lincoln or his imediate successors. Like most Americans, I was taught in the public schools of what a great president Lincoln was. The parts in this book that disturbed me -- at times enraged me -- were the abuses that the Union army inflicted on the Southern citizenry. You think what Osama bin Laden's minions did to us was terrorism? Read about the terrorism by Generals Sherman and Sheridan. That was the worst terrorism ever perpetrated on American soil.<br />The \\"Civil War\\" was never about slavery. Its roots were in economics. The South simply did not want to continue to fund a government it saw as abusive to it. They wanted to exercise their \\"duty\\", as Jefferson would say, to \\"throw off\\" that abusive government.<br />If Lincoln were alive today, he'd most certainly be characterized as a white supremacist. He had no pining to see the black man freed; he only wanted to foment an insurrection in the South. <br />But, as the adage goes, the \\"victors write the history\\". That's why generations of Americans have a positive image of \\"honest Abe\\". With Lincoln's presidency, this country ceased being a republic and became one in search of empire.<br />Professor Dilorenzo's field is economics, and he does make the case in this book for the economic underpinnings of the war. The Southern states could have left the union peacefully, but Lincoln would have none of it. What happened during \\"Reconstruction\\" is probably the most shameful episode in American history, and Dilorenzo explores this period well.<br />Most reviews critical of this book try to paint Dilorenzo as some kind of extremist with some axe to grind. I don't believe that to be the case. But some myths die hard -- and those surrounding Lincoln are some of the most entrenched.	2002-07-13

Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Tolstoy argues, very persuasively, that the core teachings of Jesus have been lost to the modern Christian (as of the 1890's, and still true today). His insight into the nature of man is nothing short of brilliant. Man is too comfortable with the way things are to really adopt Jesus approach to life, one of the core underpinnings being non resistance to evil by violence.<br />Another reviewer said that following Tolstoy's advice, we (the US, I guess) should have never opposed Hitler. We shouldn't have -- Hitler would have been out of power in short order; he was no threat to us. Forgive this brief aside.<br />Most of what passes for Christianity today is nothing of the sort. A great deal of it is self-serving. Jesus said salvation is personal -- you don't need a \\"church\\" to be saved. As Tolstoy explains, church's are largely the invention of men, who crave a hierarchy and order.<br />This book is a revelation. Christians take note: you may feel rebuked (convicted?) by the words written here.	2002-05-30

The author, William Norman Grigg, is senior editor for The New American, a publication of the John Birch Society. The JBS has been at the forefront of the effort to get the US out of the UN. This book, written in 1995, is still an important work. Mr. Grigg has meticulously foot-noted his expose into what direction the UN elite want to take the world, especially the US. Beneath its veneer and rhetoric, the UN is a socialist/communist organization. Its vision of rights is completely opposite of that of America's Founders, as Mr. Grigg explains. Read the book to see actual quotes from Americans who support the UN. You will be surprised, as I was. Our children are being programmed in government schools to accept the legitimacy and authority of the UN, and this does not bode well for the future of this country. I urge you to read this book and, if you want to stay current, subscribe to The New American.	2002-04-04

The issue is not Republicans or Democrats, as Goldberg says; it's about how the media in effect \\"take sides\\" on the important issues of the day. Like most who speak out about media bias, they themselves end up being the target of criticism, not the issue they raise. <br />I thought the best chapter was \\"The Most Important Story You Never Saw on TV\\", which concerns itself with \\"working moms\\" and how the media try to avoid saying anything about the negative aspects of mothers being out in the workforce. The worst chapter was \\"Connecting the Dots... to Terrorism\\". Especially when Mr. Goldberg gets to talking about the Arab-Israeli conflict, and how it's played in the media. The subject comes up when he talks about how the networks covered the Sept. 11th attack. He seems to imply that the coverage is pro-Arab, but I have never had that impression from watching the networks. I think Goldberg, being Jewish, and quoting an aritcle by Fiamma Nirenstein, also Jewish, loses credibility when examining how this conflict is portrayed.<br />The book forces one to remember that when the evening news is put together, every word is carefully scripted to convey a certain message. The news organizations are trying to tell you how you should think about an event, and whether or not something is important. Anyone who gets their news from someplace other than ABC, CBS, or NBC, and then tunes in and sees how they present a story can clearly see how they advocate certain positions. <br />All in all this was a great book, an important book.	2002-01-27

He was very prescient on the evolution of industrialized society (e.g., gradually becoming more secular). What happened to the inevitable rise of the proletariat? Well, I don't think Marx could have foreseen that the bourgoisie would gain control of the mass media, nor what powerful forms that media would take. This is the way the bourgoisie continue their control.<br />Even though this book isn't long (only 90 pages including several forewards written by Engels), it would be tough for most people to digest in one sitting.

While I don't agree with everything Mr. Bennett has to say, he's pretty much on the mark here.<br />Mr. Bennett starts with a review of the current state of our culture, which could be summed up as &quot;do your own thing&quot;. He then provides a brief historical background on the way marriage and family evolved. Some of his better points come in a chapter entitled &quot;Cohabitation, Illigitimacy, Fatherlessness&quot;. The biggest problem facing the black community in this country is not racism; it fatherlessness. Eighty percent of black children are born out of wedlock. This is profound.<br />As for cohabitation, if you read between the lines the message is pretty clear: women have been duped. There is much less respect for women now than 30 years ago. Further, despite its &quot;common-sense&quot; appeal, cohabitation is much more unfavorable to women than marriage.<br />Bennett addresses the push by homosexuals to be able to &quot;marry&quot;. The one point I am in total agreement with him here is that homosexuals want more than &quot;equal rights&quot;; they want societal &quot;approval&quot; of their lifestyle. If history is any teacher at all, we know this is something we dare not allow.<br />Up until 1950 or so, the strength of this country came from our social fabric; those that deviated from established norms received public censure. This is no longer the case. In this respect, America is most certainly in deline. Can it recover in time, or at all? Mr. Bennett's proposed solutions will not be very successful unless we can &quot;unprogram&quot; an entire generation. Through movies and television, young people have been programmed to think of their own gratification first and foremost. Until that is changed, any significant progress towards restoring the importance of marriage and commitment will be greatly impeded.	2002-01-01

An excellent exposition on the current state of immigration. What I found interesting of the negative reviews were that more often than not, the reviewer didn't identify themselves.<br />Anyway, as to the book itself, Brimelow merely shows what immigration has been like for the US historically. Truth be told, the founders never intended for this to be a &quot;multicultural&quot; country. If one reads the Federalist Papers (which I've reviewed here), you discover that the founders were counting on the &quot;common heritage&quot; of the people to help make the new country work. As Brimelow shows, multiculturalism is of recent vintage (1960 and later). <br />The underpinning of any country is the commonality of its people: race/ethnicity, language, customs, religion, etc. What Brimelow is saying in this book is that underpinning is being eroded, and the consequences don't bode well for the future. Despite what some reviewers here say, Brimelow doesn't speak disparagingly about current immigrants. His point is that these new immigrants are not inclined to be assimilated, as previous waves were. I think he hits the nail on the head when he says that the current view on immigration is that it's a &quot;civil right&quot; (i.e., everyone has a right to come to America). No other country I know of is thought of in this way.<br />His emphasis on the fact that the US was/is a primarily white nation is not racist; it's merely stating fact. There's no talk about what race is &quot;better&quot;, only that commonality is better. I think the charges of xenophobia by some reviewers are entirely specious.<br />What has led every great nation/empire to ruin: taking in peoples it can't assimilate or who don't want to be. Our collapse will be unavoidable. Rome lasted 476 years; I doubt we'll reach that.<br />This is a great, great book. Read it, and then use it by writing your representatives and tell them to turn off the spigot. As Brimelow points out, most Americans are opposed to further foreign immigration and yet it continues. Why? He doesn't answer that question directly -- that's another story.	2001-11-29

That's why they tend to believe whatever they see and hear on their televisions. By reading this short book, you'll gain a basic understanding of economics, and an explanation of the many myths that are taken as truths.<br />In the final chapter of this book, Hazlitt revists his work 30 years later (he was writing in 1978, and the book came out originally in 1946). He surmises that during that period, nothing was learned. If anything, he says, subjects related in the book (wage rates, price controls, government \\"make work\\") have become more political. I wonder what Hazlitt would say now.  <br />You need to read this book in order to appreciate the real consequences of actions your government wants to take.

In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden.<br />Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us.<br />Here's how 1984 applies to current events:<br />WAR IS PEACE<br />The new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept  permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;<br />FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br />&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are about to lose many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.<br />IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH<br />America's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.<br />When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you.

For me, the underlying theme of this book was profits, profits, profits. Whatever it takes to increase profits, that's what Disney will do.<br />Walt Disney was a different kind of man than Michael Eisner. Walt wanted to create good, wholesome family entertainment - he knew if he did that, the money would come. Eisner, playing off Disney's well-earned reputation, used the profits from Disney classics and theme parks to bankroll projects that Walt would have been embarrassed to mention publicly.<br />There was a lot of anecdotal evidence in this book, and some reviewers claim that these two authors essentially had 'an axe to grind', or were pushing a conservative agenda. That thought occurred to me too, though I've discovered through other sources that Eisner and his people never really liked Walt Disney's &quot;family values&quot;.<br />Disney is a business, and shareholders are entitled to a return on their money. Given the success of G-rated movies and wholesome family entertainment, the book makes you wonder why Disney would invest heavily in other forms that are certainly less profitable. But this book isn't trying to answer that question; it just sticks to providing insight into the new direction Disney is going, and the causes its management supports. Some of the 'behind the scenes' goings-on will surprise and shock you. The Mouse has its fingers in many pies, some quite unsavory. Ooops, careful, we must be 'tolerant'.<br />Upon finishing the book, you'll never look at Disney the same.	2001-08-16

Mr. Koresh was responsible for that. McVeigh obviously felt otherwise.<br />The authors took most of what McVeigh said at face value, apparently since they couldn't think of a reason why he'd be untruthful with them. I'm waiting for the release of The Final Report on the Bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building, April 19, 1995, by the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee, due out August 1st. This book promises to explore all the evidence, and see where it points.<br />One thing that did surprise me -- the book mentioned that during the guilt phase of the trial, the presiding judge allowed victim's relatives to testify. Why? What evidence of McVeigh's guilt or innocence could they possibly provide? I think, as McVeigh did, that this was done to ensure a conviction. I also think it was done to gloss over any weaknesses in the prosecution's case.<br />I did enjoy reading the letter from Ted Kaszinski, AKA the Unabomber. It's in one of the appendices and it is very thought-provoking.<br />This book, while a good start, doesn't go to the depth I thought it might; hence, I await the other book I mentioned.	2001-07-18
US	50262455	R4OJ9TW0UN2VW	1569800863	26812800	The Turner Diaries: A Novel	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Interesting theme, but not very well written	This book has a very impausible idea -- that one race would rise up and take control of not only this country, but the entire world. To exterminate, wholesale, races of people around the world is a very odd idea. But, keep in mind, this is a novel. The author, William L. Pierce, wrote this as his fantasy.<br />One idea I found preposterous, having served in the military, was that the military (or at least, the white portion of it) would rise up and aid and abet a takeover of this country.<br />As I mentioned in my title for this review, the work is not very well written. I'd heard about this book and wanted to check it out for myself. It could have done without the melodramatic touch of putting &quot;this is racist propaganda&quot; on the book cover. This isn't propaganda, it's a NOVEL. I have my opinion as to who would want to affix that kind of epithet, but that's not germane to this book review.	2001-07-13

Those of you who've read \\"The Great Betrayal\\" by this author will enjoy this title too. Isn't it interesting how \\"America First\\" isn't a popular idea anymore? Well, Pat's all for America, and not an 'isolationist' America. His points are well taken on the historical record of American foreign policy, at least what it was before the 'sea-change' after the Second World War. .... He's right in saying that Germany in 1940 was not a threat to us (America). We didn't get into WWII to 'make the world safe for democracy'; we did it for the money (the bankers). Pat's book is a call to return to the foreign policy America had prior to 1950 -- to try to avoid entanglements overseas. That's going to be a tough sell today.	2001-06-14

These essays, primarily written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, show the great care and forethought the founders put into constructing our constitution.<br />This book is a tough read, and I found myself referring to a dictionary quite often. The arguments are very precise and methodical, but sometimes difficult to follow.<br />The fact that our Constitution has endured this long is a tribute  to the genius of these men. It's unfortunate that our schools seem to be glossing over the enormous significance and importance of these men's contribution of the very liberty our people live under. An important work for any American to read.	2001-06-14
US	50262455	R39PIAE599YMFB	0882791354	609899488	Global Tyranny...Step by Step: The United Nations and the Emerging New World Order	Books	5	44	47	N	N	Should be mandatory reading for all Americans	This book will surprise you with its revelations, such as - what do the current and all previous UN Secretary-Generals have in common? All are/were socialists or Marxists (without exception). Here's the straight scoop folks: the UN Charter and the US Constitution are incompatible with each other. Something is going to give. The main difference, as the book points out, is the source of 'rights'. Our Constitution recognizes and protects 'God given' rights. With the UN, rights are not absolute, and subject to any number of provisos. Get this book, read it (it's not too long), and encourage your friends/family to read it too. We needed to get out of the UN 'yesterday'.	2001-06-06
US	50262455	RYDN89QUQR4DV	0140265473	219042777	Vietnam: A History	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A fairly even-handed account	I found this book to be very enlightening, especially the early history of Vietnam. I just missed out on going over, but I do remember the nightly updates on the news. Mr. Karnow sheds some light on the political intrigues going on behind the scenes, and the misguided thinking that got us into this morass....We (the US) of course denied it officially; but we were guilty of our share of &quot;war crimes&quot; in Vietnam. <br />I recommend the book, and the companion video series (which I watched also). It was interesting seeing the cast of characters described in the book in real life (circa 1981-1983). Again, I think Karnow does a fairly even-handed job of covering the totality of our involvement in Vietnam. Have we learned anything from Vietnam? Well, as evidenced by our action in Kosovo, no. ...	2001-05-21

I got the feeling reading it that I'd 'heard it all before'. I have personally known people who were Masons. As the book says, you can't really discern anything nefarious about them. You have to be 'an insider'. The book concentrated on Freemasonry, though later touched on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and its 'secret agenda'. Though a good read, if you want more info you'd be better off getting books specifically on the CFR or Freemasonry.	2001-01-25

The book is a very compelling read. The listing of CFR members in the back is quite enlightening too! A 'man of the people' will NEVER rise to the presidency. Even if he has his own money, the 'shadow government' controls the mass media, and thereby profoundly affect candidacies.<br />Being a republican, I always had a high opinion of President Reagan. The author shows clearly how Reagan's actions did not match his rhetoric. This was not unique to Reagan, either. The average American doesn't understand how our President's policies are shaped by people outside the 'constiutional government'.<br />This book has 'the other side' of American history of the 20th century, and it's nothing like you or I learned in school! This is, of course, by design. Read this book, and encourage others to do so -- it's the only way we, as ordinary people, can begin to take back our country.	2001-01-11
US	50262455	R1BA7MF1QKCG1O	1559722770	754843666	The Dysfunctional President: Inside the Mind of Bill Clinton	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Now it all makes sense	This book, or better yet, the revised version, is a must read for every American. Get a look inside the man we elected twice. Dr. Fick's analysis of Clinton as the &quot;Adult Child of an Alcoholic&quot; sheds   light on  the apparently erractic behavior of our president.<br />The most satisfying  part of the book for me was learning that Clinton's problems are not the  result of some &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy&quot;. Rather, they are  manifestations of Clinton's unresolved childhood problems.<br />Read this book  and you'll be able to make sense of the chaos Clinton creates. One thing is  for sure -- it'll take a while to restore the credibility and dignity of  the office of president after Clinton leaves, such is the damage done.	2000-06-06
US	50262455	R1C1YDGKW0J4RH	1892796007	213929315	My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding	Books	5	77	97	N	N	An 11th hour wake up call	Before you dismiss Mr. Duke (based on the character assassination in the media), take time to read his book. Remember, there's always two sides to every story. Question: why do many people today lament the decline in  respect and morality in this country? Read this book, and you'll get some  of the answers. The fact is, and this is not in dispute, that Jewish people  are the heads of, or in position of power in, all the major news and  entertainment companies. Is there anything wrong in this? Well, on its face  no, until you discover that most of the people in question are Zionist or   Zionist-sympathic. The impact of this is that they are, by and large,  anti-Christian. That explains why many things are the way they are in this  society. Is it 'anti-semitic' to talk this way? As David says, that label  is applied to short-circuit any meaningful debate on the subject. It's the  'kiss of death' in this society, is it not? After reading the book, one  could say that Mr. Duke is a 'separatist', not a 'supremist'. He makes use  of historical documents referencing the thinking of the people who founded  this country. Those (white) men were quite visionary, and they foresaw the  problems that would arise if black and white had to co-exist as equals in  this society. Mr. Duke's indictment of the civil rights movement is  excellent. Is the black man truly better off now? Oh, on average he may be  wealthier, but look at the devastation wrought on the black family. Every  American should read this book, if for no other reason than to see the  'other side of the story'. Then, armed with both sides of the issue(s), one  can make reasoned judgements. Please don't dismiss this book without  opening the cover; the 'powers that be' would, of course, want you to do  exactly that. What's wrong, are they afraid of what you might learn?	2000-04-17
