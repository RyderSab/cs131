I think it's a pretty good book and to tell her story through her own eyes.  The only part I didn't agree with is towards the end when she starts bashing Liza.  Otherall its a very good book, very poignant and honest.  I think Ms. Luft has a lot of courage to write  from her heart and tell how it really was to live with her mother Judy Garland and also tells of how her Moms true and dedicated  love of her children.   Though it is a biogrpahy of Judy Garland it is more a biography on Lorna Luft.  It's worth reading.	2003-06-11

I recently just finished this book, and I couldn't put it down.  It was a very well written and wonderful story.  Carole Gift Page has a wonderful way of telling a story.  You really get to know the characters.  A young music teacher, Cassandra, falls for an Italian tenor named Antonia  It's a very moving story, also there is a mystery inerwoven in the story, that keeps you guessing till the end.  It was one of the few books I just couldn't put down.  I wanted to get to the end to see what the mystery was about.  If I could I would give it more than five stars, it certainly deserved it!  I look forward to reading future books by Carole Gift Page, with these characters.   There is a character in the story named Andrew, Cassandra's father.  He really represents such a loving father.  Anyone who likes a good clean romance novel, this is for you.	2001-07-22
