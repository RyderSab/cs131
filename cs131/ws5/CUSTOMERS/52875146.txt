It is always good to revisit popular assumptions to determine their validity but I'd be more impressed by this book if I'd been able to read peer reviews, which I have not been able to find, that substantiate his research and conclusions. 20-20 hindsight is always easy, and I have no doubt that many of the author's claims are valid as to how the New Deal policies prolonged the Depression, and how the New Deal spent money in places that would help it politically rather than in the places that needed it most, but his free market bias is so evident: everything would have been better if the free market had been left alone to run its course. Sure, except for the workingman who was slaving for starvation wages, if he could find work. Child labor, unsafe working conditions, such as the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, which the author refers to as \\"tragic\\", none of these things are the result of the free market in his view. As long as there are more workers than jobs the free market will never protect worker's rights. He seems to believe that the Union movement was only about obtaining power for power's sake and not about protecting the worker. He accuses the New Deal of using examples of Business abuses that were atypical in order to pass anti-business legislation but is guilty of the same thing in his anti-union bias.<br /><br />Perhaps this book will bring about a re-examination of the New Deal, and FDR, by an impartial, unbiased academic. Let's hope so.	2004-07-25

He faults Roosevelt for EVERY move he makes. If FDR made a move that was ideologically based, Fleming criticizes him for not being pragmmatic, if FDR made a decision that was pragmatically based, Fleming criticizes him for not being true to his ideology. Fleming also criticizes FDR based on information that we now know but does not credit FDR for decisions that are supported by similar information.<br />One of Fleming's premises seems to be that we should NOT have fought WWII and, while it is good to re-examine our accepted beliefs, the Nazis WERE bad and had world domination aims, the Japanese WERE expansionists, had brutalized their captives and the rape of Nanking was typical of their subjugation of the countries that they conquered. Germany was technologically superior to Japan and if we'd pursued a Japan first policy Germany's technology might have triumphed.<br />While I do not believe that Roosevelt was pro-Communist I do believe that Fleming correctly portrays Roosevelt's self-delusion about Soviet Russia's aims and its totalitarian methods which we all know were equally as bad as the Nazis. However, FDR was trying to get Stalin to commit to fighting Japan so that the U.S wouldn't have to conduct an invasion against the entire Japanese army. No one knew if the A bomb would be successful. It is also clear that Roosevelt had no clear goals for post-war Europe. This may be attributable to his failing health. If FDR's health was truly as bad as Fleming portrays it (another of his major criticisms of FDR), FDR is to be condemned for his egotism in not stepping down, but almost every politician is an egotist and believes he knows best and will act best.<br />How reputable the author is as an historian is uncertain. He has certainly written many historical books but without going to and reading his citations it is impossible to know how accurate he is.<br />The book is certainly thought provoking and that says a lot.tainly written many historical books but without going to and reading his citations it is impossible to know how accurate he is.<br />The book is certainly thought provoking and that says a lot.	2004-06-29

But most of the sources prove to be a waste of time. The detailed material he provides about the Patton's ancestors is completely irrelevant to an understanding of the man, it is filler that could be greatly abbreviated. We really don't need to read quotes from letters they sent each other.<br />The author also pads the book by repeating, word for word, quotes or paragraphs contining conclusions he has made in diffgerent parts of the book. Does he really think we've forgotten what we've already read? His writing is also strangely stilted at times, using verb and adjectives that don't seem to fit the context of the paragraphs.<br />I was not offended by the opinion that Patton's irrational, hyperbolic pep talks to the troops encouraged the atrocities that they committed, I think that it is a fair conclusion and part of Patton's character as shown by other statements, acknowledged by other biographers, and Patton, himself. He shot off his mouth without thinking.<br />Another flaw of the book is the maps. The author gives great detail about the places attacked, passed through, avoided, etc. but the maps show only the larger towns.<br />The author's conclusion is that Patton was a great tactical general with many character flaws, which seems to be an accurate assessment.<br />It just isn't a well written book.	2004-06-10

The author, however, has to puff himself up and repeat how he discovered the information to support his view. The fact that he was a naval Captain and had visited the areas traveled by the Chinese and had technical knowledge about sea travel that other historians didn't, allowed him to put together facts thought to be unrelated.

That was before reading this book. This book has more source material and, consequently, more detail and is a better text. &quot;The Battle Of The Ironclads&quot; has more contemporary illustrations so both books complement each other in some ways. Despite the additional source material there are strange omissions in Davis' book, for one he does not mention why the Navy Department disliked Erickson: &quot;The Princeton&quot; affair wherein a gun, not designed by Erickson, blew up killing some high govenment officials when tested on the Princeton, a ship designed by Erickson, and Erickson was blamed for the deaths. Davis also casually mentions that the Confederacy was working on an ironclad called the Richmond when the Confederates abandoned the Norfolk Boatyard. In fact, work was proceeding on both the Richmond and Virginia simultaneously and it is possible that the Virginia could have been completed earlier with more devastating affect on the Union fleet if all work had concentrated on her.<br />Davis' work is the more scholarly of the two with an index and list of references. Either one is a great read with much detail and the true student of the Battle or of the Civil War will want to read both.	2003-12-15

This book is one of the best I've read on the subject and one of the best Civil War books, I've read. (I'll have to check others in the same series.) The text is superb, very detailed, and the collection of period photographs, illustrations and maps is terrific and bring the event and participants to life. Despite the fact that both sides realized the importance of ironclads and built many of them (more by the industrial north, of course) this was the only battle of the Civil War in which ironclads opposed each other. It's also interesting to note that the C.S.S Virginia (known to the north as the Merrimack, the Union frigate whose hull was used by the Confederates) caused the biggest defeat and loss of life to the U.S Navy until Pearl Harbor. My only complaint is that the book does not credit the primary sources from which the information was obtained.	2003-11-29

I have a long-standing interest in history with a particular interest in american military history and FDR. I've read extensively and was interested in a biography of Churchill to dove-tail with my prior reading. As an american reader I find that at least a quarter of the book could have been deleted as it contains asides wherein Jenkins discusses other British historical figures and makes comparisons of Churchill's political positions with prior British parlimentary figures. Some of that is somewhat interesting as it points out how interrelated the members of the British ruling class were up until WWII but the information is not particularly relevant to understanding Churchill. I have no quarrel with Jenkin's comments and insights into Churchill, the author's political background I think is helpful and important in his analysis of Churchill. For a British reading public the British minutia may be interesting, for me it made reading the book more of a chore than it needed to be. Fortunately most of the trivia is in the chapters about Chrchill's earlier life. I'll have to read Manchester.	2003-01-31

A Memoir	Books	2	16	21	N	N	Vernon can climb	I saw on television part of a lecture the author gave at UC and was very impressesd with him and wanted to read his book.  The highlights of his life given in the lecture covered the only interesting parts of the book, his childhood.  The book is poorly written which might be acceptable if he wrote it alone, but he didn't, he had help.  His childhood experiences growing up in a segregated society are interesting and his perspectives on segregation are, too, but once he graduates from law school he moves from one position to the next, seemingly moving up by being the right person in the right place at the right time knowing the right people. He must have been capable and a hard worker to handle those positions and, clearly, he learned people skills but there is nothing to indicate his thoughts or positions on any of the issues with which he was confronted except in the most general way. Nothing comes across as showing him as being inspiring, charismatic, or even interesting other than his being where he was, with the people he connected with and the times he participated in. The people he dealt with were giants, Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley as two examples in the legal profession, but he gives no insights into any of these people or even interesting anecdotes. Just a list of who they were. His reportage of his contacts with the Clintons, early on, after Bill lost his bid for re-election to the Governorship was that he told them that Hillary should stop using her maiden name and start using Clinton and when she did Bill got re-elected. There is absolutely no sense of the man, or of his contemporaries or, even, really, his times.  Having lived through most of them, myself, I can place his story in the context of the times but for younger readers without a sense of the historical context it can't seem very inspiring. I'm glad I didn't buy the book but only borrowed it from the public library.	2002-02-09

The book is as relevant now as when written and is a must read for every american who is serious about understanding his country. What one realizes in reading the book is how novel and radical was the american experiment in creating a state that was both a republic and a democracy. De Toqueville's research was amazing, as well, he read the laws and constitutions of the various states, he didn't just observe the manifestation of american government and society. His assessments of the plusses and minuses of our government forms was incredibly astute and it is interesting to reflect on the changes that took place in the government after his time and how accurately he foresaw the advantages and disadvantages of those changes, as well.  Given the short period of time that he spent in this country and the distances that he travelled one stands in awe of his work.

The diversions are what make the book unique and which provide the varied dimensions that make one sense,and feel, in three dimensions, life at the turn of the last century.  It is a stereopticon view.  It is hard to conceive of any facet of turn-of-the-century American life which isn't explored, and described, in depth.  If you don't like detail then avoid this book. I was constantly overwhelmed by the research that went into it, the amazing time and effort.  The style is not dry but riveting and alive.  It is a book that I wish I could say I produced, how anyone can give it less than five stars is beyond me. That the author committed suicide because he felt he failed is, truly, a tragedy, but it is impossible to see how he could have matched this effort in the rest of his lifetime.  I read \\"Common Ground\\" when it first came out, the author's first book, it was good but this is great.

But his premise that they are &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is wrong.  If he had more knowledge of American  History he would realize that EVERY generation, at least from the  Revolution through World War Two, and, particularly, those that fought in  the Civil War and in World War One, shared all of the characteristics that  he attributes to the World War Two generation. This shouldn't detract from  the stories he presents but a more accurate analysis would define how the  generations that followed World War Two have changed from the preceding  generations.

As a stand alone book it isn't quite as good and might not be appreciated as much if read by itself.  &quot;The Last Open Road&quot;  is multi-dimensional, it is a great car tale and also a coming of age story  of a young man who wants to be a sportscar mechanic and is pursuing a  girlfriend at the same time.  All three threads are intertwined.  The book  is wonderfully evocative of time and place, you can smell and feel the  summer nights which he describes. In &quot;Montezuma's Ferrari&quot; the  protagonist is a successful mechanic and married so the focus is mostly on  the car tales and the descriptions are not as engrossing but the book is  still wonderful.	2000-06-22

This book is a snorer. 25% of the book is as follows: &quot;I always thought Bugs were  cool.&quot;  &quot;I decided to buy one.&quot;  &quot;I found one.&quot;  &quot;I bought it.&quot;  &quot;I drove it for several years.&quot;  &quot;I loved it.&quot;  &quot;I had some not particularly interesting  incidents while I drove it.&quot;  &quot;I had to sell it.&quot;  &quot;I  miss it.&quot;  There are, maybe, five or six mildly interesting  stories most of which could be told about any car. Few of the VW specific  stories are of interest.<br />  It was a waste of money and time and it makes  me suspicious of any reader reviews.  From now on I'm going to be very  suspicious of 5 Star reviews.	2000-06-22

I haven't laughed so hard in years and was in tears at the end.  I can't say that this is a \\"great\\" book as  in: \\"will be a classic\\" but it is wonderful, terrific and a  \\"must\\" read.  I am buying three copies, one to send to a favorite  aunt, one to loan to all my friends and one to send to my kids in another  state.  I haven't done anything like this with a book since \\"Last Open  Road\\".  This book deserves to be more widely read.  I'm certainly  going to look at the author's other books. Don't miss it.<br /><br />It's 2011 and my wife and I stumbled upon the book again and re-read it. We couldn't stop laughing. I bought more copies for friends.	2000-06-13

This is one of the great ones for the description it gives of rural life and values and is tremendously evocative of a sense of place and time. I don't know if young people will have the same reaction but I'm going to give it  to my eleven year old son and find out.	1999-12-09

The author is a  \\"new age\\" rabbi (my description, not necessarily his).  He  reports that he has experienced astral projection and other extra-sensory  perceptions.  While he states that he has talked with hundreds of  individuals who claim to be reincarnated after having died in the  Holocaust, he only refers to the specifics of about twelve cases.  The rest  of his book is discourse on jewish philosophy and teachings, as they relate  to reincarnation, and his personal interpretation of reincarnation as he  perceives it fits into those teachings.  If one is interested in \\"case  studies\\" one is best served by reading Ian Stevenson, M.D. 's books.  Interesting, though, the evidence from both authors shows that those  individuals who believe themselves to be reincarnated, and I am convinced  that they have been, are greatly affected by their past life recollections  in some ways, i.e. they have phobias related to past life events, but the  FACT of being reincarnated seems to have no affect on how they lead their current lives.  Upon reflection, that makes sense, and so, my conclusion is: reincarnation does occur but: so what?	1999-12-05

The book spends more time describing the details of the trips and the surroundings the author  found himself in than on describing the subjects themselves. In support of  the evidence of reincarnation the author concludes that the subjects are  truthful and the evidence cannot be explained by any other explanation than  reincarnation, but it is much more interesting  to read the evidence in the  several books that Ian Stevenson has written about his case studies.	1999-11-29

Let me just say that I've lent this book to at least twenty people, car lovers and non-car lovers. They have all loved the book.  Unfortunately, the book wasn't returned and I bought two more copies, one to keep and one to lend out. For sportscar lovers this is a MUST read.<br /><br />All the books in the series are good, but this is the best. The others are enjoyable, particularly for sports car lovers, but this one is great because it's appeal is almost universal.	1998-01-28

Fraser's historical research is detailed and complete and he manages to teach history in a very entertaining manner.  &quot;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot;  The research that goes into these books is formidable.  Flashman manages to participate in the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Sikh Uprising, England's invasion of Afghanistan, John Brown's taking of Harpers Ferry, Custer's Last Stand, etc.  While I have not read all of the books in the series, my conclusion, to date, is that Fraser is much better at presenting British History than he is at presenting American History.  Perhaps it is my being less familiar with British History, as an American, although I was an History major in college and did study Indian History.  The characters seem more colorful, the plots more complicated, the intrigues more convoluted. My intent is to read the rest of the Flashman series by reading the non-American books first.	1998-01-13
