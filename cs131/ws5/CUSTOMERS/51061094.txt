The mystery is fine, but the context is important.  What happens when those charged to preserve order find themselves in a country descending into lunacy?  As John Derbyshire illustrated in volume 1 of Fire From The Sun (Mao Zedong China and the Cultural Revolution), what happens when the hoods of high school become the means to power in the hands of a leader with the skill to manage victory?  When the government takes on the rules of a gang, what happens to the lives of the every-day Joe, who can only bemoan, \\"How is this happening?\\"  That is the part of the book that interested me the most.  The character bracketing the story is a nice addendum. <br /> <br />	2005-09-26

Clearly it is both, but the style is clearly that of a serial.  In some part it is a contribution to the argument of who will have the better life journey, Rebecca (capable, and unencumbered by scruples), or Amelia (a simpleton [as stated by the author in the next-to-last chapter], and hobbled by a highly developed moral structure).  One does get a good view of life in England around the year 1815, but you would not miss out on much if you gave it a pass. <br />	2005-08-31

We are beings who are genetically motivated to procreate, to form into social groups, to pursue status, and so forth.  We are also tuned to be great members of tribes, with the concomitant behavioral limiters of 1) folks with whom we will spend our entire lives, 2) parents and community with their capabilities to reward and punish.  We are the descendents of those who did well in the hunter-gatherer wars.  College campuses are unreal places where the genetic motivators are in full swing, without the behavioral limiters we were tuned for.  Then add in birth-control and a culture where the preeminent advertisers get rich by enticing us through sex.  The resulting situations, as illustrated by this great book, illustrate the unintended dynamics of the mismatch.  When we give freedom to Homo Sapiens, just what kind of beings are being enabled?  This book is important, but the journey is not pleasant.  We don't relish our darker sides being illuminated.  An unanswered question concerns how these dynamics will impact the country as we march into the future. <br /> <br />	2005-03-31

Suppose you were the wife of an upper-level Colonial Army officer who, during the annual winter pause in fighting, visits the family from November to February, then he goes back off to war and is thus not around to talk to.  You, the wife, now have the management of the farm/business, with perhaps 5 children to raise, with the task of planning for the family's escape should the British invade your part of the colonies, and since women were the fighters against outbreaks of deadly infectious agents (smallpox, cholera, yellow fever, tuberculosis, measles, whooping cough, etc) you could be called into this action, and, by the way, you are 7 months pregnant.  Added to this is the good chance that you could deliver the child in the heat of summer (the year being about 1780) with no electric fans, no air-conditioning, and with 1780's medical knowledge (no knowledge of viruses or bacteria, and no antibiotics).  As illustrated by this book, this routinely was the situation of our Founding Mothers.  And of course there is more.  (By the way, window screens will not be invented for 100 years, leaving folks with the interesting choice of leaving the windows open and being eaten alive by mosquitoes, or closing the windows and sweltering.)	2004-06-15

The subject of this book is in large part about the life and times of a woman in an emerging Islamic theocracy (with touches of discourse on the four featured literary areas: Lolita, The Great Gatsby, Henry James, and Austin).  It is presented in a disjointed, piecemeal fashion making it quite hard to walk away with an integrated representation of the intended messages.

This book describes how morality could emerge from the need to optimize in-groups (&quot;us&quot;) and coalesce in a common defense from out-groups (&quot;them&quot;).  When we are seen as the descendents of hundreds of generations of hunter-gatherers, the idea is that certain lines of behavior might confer reproductive advantage, thus the genes motivating in-group cooperation and mutual defense towards common out-groups would prosper into the future.  The rules of such cooperation and mutual altruism become codified into moral systems.  A superb book.	2004-01-29

Skin color was a local adaptation to the environment, facilitating the optimum balance of folic acid and vitamin D.  This book, while fiction, illustrates the commonness of our natures.  The genetically-provided ambition for status, money, and power (assisted by our impressive abilities to rationalize) operates at different levels for us all.  Add in the levels of competition, and the scarcity of opportunity in that society, and the room for complexity emerges.  A central part of this book concerns a man who's freedom is purchased by his parents when he is a child.  This free-black Henry finds his path to &quot;bettering himself&quot; lies through the purchase and domination of slaves of his own; he rationalizes he will be &quot;the best master&quot;.  The many ways slavery and status can play in such a fluid situation is well illustrated by the interplay of plot lines throughout this story.  It is the interplay of the variations that makes this book superb.	2004-01-02

Ants are probably just following the feelings presented as motivators by the ant's genetics.  So to the ant the existence of something that looks like a larger organization might be hard to perceive.  Yet, to us, ant colonies do seem to exist, and their behaviors seems to change as the colony gets older (they become less aggressive).  The meta-organization is a result of the interactions of the ants to each other, in conjunction with the motivations coming from genetics.  So this author tries to argue that we people are components of super-organizations without realizing it.  And yet, ant colonies have very strong genetic linkages, so the source of the cohesion is understandable from the perspective of overall genetic benefit.  With people the genetic cohesion is less strong, so perhaps the notion of super-organism is a bit much.  But we do have predictable patterns of behavior (tribe, state, country), so some sort of emergent, strong bonds do form between us humans.  Perhaps the idea of a controlling super-organization is a bit too much, but our individual interests do get sublimated from time to time by group dynamics (kind of like slime mold forming up into what looks like a multi-celled organism when under stress).  Think of the battle of Gettysburg.  People marched to their deaths by the thousands for the propagation of something.  This author has touched upon a series of interesting ideas, the book is worth reading.	2003-12-26

And it originated during times when most people couldn't write, so the issue of proving a case (such as in a agreement) is troublesome (especially in times when plagues and such could kill witnesses at any time).  The world is a fuzzy set, and yet the law needs to set a finite set of rules in place, so exceptions constantly challenge.  The needs of the state can supercede the issue of fairness, such as in the rule that &quot;ignorance is no excuse&quot;.  Judges are generally friends of the wealthy and not compatriots of the commoner.  If a man has large debts, and dies, how can his children, who were not party to the agreements, be held liable via the estate?  Many such questions arise and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. tries to address the fluid basis for our legal system.	2003-12-18

It does have an interesting mix of characters, and it gave me a sense of the personal dynamics of life during the Civil War (when one thought of distance and transportation in terms of being on the back of a horse).  The depiction of battle from the perspective of a regular soldier, with the killing being an entirely local phenomenon, the continuous confusion, and no picture of the greater strategy (are we actually dying for some good purpose, or is my commander an idiot?), is well illustrated.  I don't know if I will bother with the rest of the series, but I thought this book was worth the read.

It is set in England, just before World War I, and during the time the Archduke of Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo.  The mystery is fine, the writing is good, but a central lurking issue is whether England will be drawn into the upcoming war (if there will be a war).  Is this a fight England needs to join?  Anne Perry believes it was.  Obviously this impacts our times.  Yet I feel WWI is a poor example because while one must repel invasion by unfriendly forces, WWI is more about powerful privileged men (the Russian Tsar, the German Kaiser, the English King, and the French whatever) and their cronies,  who should have met on the dueling ground, but instead sent millions of their young male subjects to kill each other.  Cowardice can trump fairness, and WWI is an example.  Sadly, WWI also caused WWII, where even more young men died.  I love Anne Perry's Thomas Monk/Hester Latterly books, but No Graves As Yet did not resonate with me.	2003-10-22

Perhaps this book could have been a good cautionary tale about the hazards for young women when they do not develop their abilities and instead hang all their fortunes on well-meaning promises of youth.  Or this could have been a good tale of how to develop a quality life after experiencing a father with a fixation on being in control, and who prefers to ignore his sexual abuse of his daughters.  It might have been a lot of things.  As it is, the only lesson I could precipitate from this story is &quot;trust no one&quot;, which in this case includes the author because the personality profiles drawn in one part of the book conflicts with a later profile of that same personality (authors who uncaringly contradict themselves are themselves abusive, because the time their readers spend in such mush is deemed of no value).	2003-09-30

Can we do great harm to each other with less-than-total nuclear war, certainly.  But we would continue as a species.  And our predecessors survived the concurrent existence of smallpox, cholera, yellow fever, tuberculosis, polio, the plague, and many other infectious agents.  And as to nanotechnology, the world is a tough place at the atomic level, so delicate processes would not survive, and robust devices will probably not have the flexibility needed for an Assembler.  Nanotech, if we ever master it, will be a next century or beyond technology.  Our freedoms may be the unavoidable victim as we seek to enhance security in a time of individual access to dangerous technologies.  This book is a great overview of impending, possible disasters, but the major premise of the book, namely that there is a great probability of our species causing our own extinction within this century is not sufficiently supported.  It does end with an interesting call for us to seek human colonies &quot;off world&quot;, though I don't think we understand the complexity of the support structure needed to have a self-sustaining colony on Mars (i.e. what happens when an essential integrated circuit manufactured in an industruial complex finally breaks).	2003-07-23

Squirrels, whales, and crickets do not have our language facility, thus they do not have self-help books, preachers, or legions of well-meaning advisors.  Yet they are born with the genetically provided rules (feelings) that allow them to be successful squirrels, wonderful whales, and competent crickets.  We too have genetically provided rules, which sociobiologists and such are trying to discover.  This wonderful book is the author's attempt to explain some of the conditions of motherhood, the relations between mothers and babies, and sometimes tough choices mothers have to make.  This work is, in my opinion, magnificent.<br />NOTE TO REVIEWERS:  If one starts off a review with phrases like &quot;goofy liberal&quot;, &quot;ranting conservative&quot;, or &quot;clueless libertarian&quot;, readers like me read no further.  Plus my estimation of the reviewer's intelligence is halved.	2003-06-30

Messages, such as &quot;go North&quot;, and &quot;don't travel in a straight line&quot; don't seem sensitive enough to warrant encryption into a troublesome code such as a quilt pattern.  Don't bother reading this.	2003-06-28

His way of explaining a system where we can handle interpreting sentences &quot;on the fly&quot;, from a starting word, building a structure of meaning while proceeding to an unknown end (the end of the sentence is not known to us until we get there) is consitent with how computers determine the meaning of commands.  Showing the place of recursion is impressive.  The book is not always easy to read, but I was impressed with the quality and consistency of thought.  I hated grammer in 7th grade (in the 1960s), so my English teacher would have been amazed at my reading a book on language.  I recommend this book highly.	2003-04-28

Her in-the-mind characterization of what it is like to be an American soldier/warrior in Vietnam is so believeable, and so disturbing.  I liked that part the best.  The rest of the story combines murder-mystery with psychology, good action, and clever construction.  I have read all of her books, and this is my second-favorite of her works (The Beekeeper's Apprentice is still #1 with me).	2003-04-26

This tale of interleaved sociopaths is the antithesis of Jane Austin.  The people of Quality and Breeding are all mentally disturbed, only the female servant is with sense (she declares herself so in Volume I, chapter 12, page 1).  Given the continuum: Perfect Family - Normal Family - Dysfunctional Family - ?? (my vocabulary fails me), these folks rate the \\"??\\".  Clearly the quality of the literary effort is superb, the writing and characterization is terrific.  The story does have a useful function in illustrating the Darwinian nature of life, but don't read it for its ability to elevate.  Is this book entertaining? Yes.  But it raises a disturbing question about ourselves that this should become a Classic (think gawkers at a terrible car wreck).  The story does conclude by throwing a contrived happy ending as one might throw a bone to a starving dog.  (November 2012: I gave this two stars?  One was too many.  What was I thinking?)	2003-04-09

This book is the best description of Medieval battle I have ever seen.  Quite graphic, and quite beleiveable.  The brutality to gallantry ration is at least fifteen to one.  Chivalry wasn't dead, but it could get you killed.  And yes, they do shoot, stab, slash, impale, and otherwise mistreat horses.	2003-03-03

Some of these brave folks pushed and pulled 700 pound hand-carts from Iowa City to the Great Basin.  The story has a good mix of charactes and illustrates the trials and emotions experienced by these adventurers.  I am a gentile (non-Mormon), and I enjoyed the story.	2002-10-25

This is a big vista, skillfully rendered.  The ending is abrupt.  Tom Wolfe himself said he didn't know how to end this appropriately, which shows.  Yet the ending did appeal to me in its whimsicalness.  A heck of a book.	2002-10-15

They believe they are the recipients of the perfect revelation from God (in the Koran).  They can see how wealthy the Western world is, and our wealth, combined with our being infidels (for the most part), makes our opulence difficult to explain.  A powerful economy needs freedom, so it can self-sort itself into an efficient arrangement.  Islamic governments cannot abide freedom (if the rule of Allah is to be maintained), so they cannot really compete.  And we cannot fix the problem.<br />The author has presented a well reasoned and yet troubling premise.<br />Those who make policy should read this book.	2002-06-18

Margaret Thatcher clearly shows the depth of her intellect in this book.  The subject is the world, its future, and her thoughts on how to handle the rough seas ahead.  I didn't always agree with her conclusions, but I admired her ability and willingness to back each of her points with a matrix of considerations.  Most people want to pontificate bland decrees which are presumed to stand on their own (because the pontificator deigns to speak), but Mrs. Thatcher (I am not a monarchist nor admirer of titled gentry) cares enough to not only proclaim what she believes, but to provide her ideas with a foundation of ideas.	2002-05-31

So while the story doesn't have the entertaining repartee of earlier Russell/Holmes stories, it does have an ultimate point.  The setting is the estate of the \\"Landed Gentry\\", which makes it hard for us of more modest means to feel much sympathy for their troubles.  Yet, with patience on the part of the reader, the big-picture comes into focus when the story coalesces into an integrated whole by its powerful conclusion.  Laurie R. King's depiction of the horrors of World War I puts the blood back into what Russell in a different book laments as \\"death but no blood\\".	2002-05-23

She is a very perceptive lady with a terrific way with words.  The first 100+ pages of this book seems like a work vying for an &quot;Oprah&quot; recommendation, but then it illustrates why the beginning is necessary.  The interplay of Rae (the book's subject) and her environment is an important point of the book, but its nature is such that a less skillful writer couldn't make it interesting.  The author once again shows her skill; I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and I learned much from it.  The hike is worth the effort.	2001-04-08

A book like this introduces us to the idea that genetics has an operational purpose, and each side of the species (male and female) may have separate strategies to maximize  advantage (but of course we also co-operate).  Children raised in tough  times do better with both parents being good parents.  Genetics do not have  politically correct agenda, they either motivate successful behaviors  (meaning  being passed into the future), or they do not go forward.  If  such dynamics favor Victorian methodologies, so be it (or not).  This  fascinating attempt to explore why we are the way we are is worth reading  because it is thought provoking; Evolutionary Psychologists might just help  us better manage our mutually shared existence (even if we have to stand up  to our genetics, which is really his point regarding why the Victorians had  some good ideas).	2000-05-18

The rest of the book is a great overview of who did what, what could have gone  wrong, what accidentally went right, what pressures exist for  epidemiologists, why emergence leads to unplanned results, and more.  A  really scary statement is that in  Russia lately, people have tried to  acquire the Smallpox virus from cadavers in the permafrost.  A very  worthwhile read.	2000-03-02
