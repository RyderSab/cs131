The first two thirds are devoted to a dreary procession of BS artists who prey on the unemployed: career \\"coaches\\", seminars, boot camps (!), inspirational self-help books, so-called Christian businessmen's groups.  Anybody with half a lick of sense can see right off the bat that none of these folks are going to be of any use at all in finding a job. So it's really a study of hucksters and confidence men (and women), though Ehrenreich's razor-sharp writing makes it worth reading (she's especially on target when dealing with the \\"Christian\\" meetings).  The way middle-management people *really* find jobs, as she eventually points out, is through their Rolodex of contacts, college roommates, and the like.  Ability (and even \\"image\\") has little to do with it: just check with Michael Brown at FEMA.<br /><br />Of course, there really is a good deal of BS in the corporate executive world, but this is nothing new.  Sinclair Lewis wrote sendups of mindless boosterism eighty years ago, and I'm sure it wasn't new then.  I spent fifteen years in the corporate life (in computer systems engineering, after years in academia), and those of us who actually got things done found the inspirational pronouncements coming from the \\"C\\" suites on the top floor to be mostly a source of merriment.	2005-09-21

As a long-time supporter of free speech, this sort of thing always raises my antennas of suspicion.  And it's clear after reading it just why he didn't want us to see it! Harvard should be embarrassed to have Dershowitz on its faculty (and in a named professorship, at that).  My only reservation about Finkelstein's book is that it sometimes seems like overkill.  From time to time I felt like holding up my hand and shouting \\"Enough already! You've proved your case\\".<br /><br />I read Dershowitz's book (The Case for Israel) when it came out and am embarrased to have found it convincing at the time. Since than, I've done a little fact-checking of my own and found the book wanting in ways that Finkelstein doesn't even discuss: specifically the matter of land-purchases in the pre-1948 period. While technically, a good deal of land was (as D. maintains), purchased by Zionist settlers from its owners, he fails to point out the trickery and manipulation of absentee landlords which was involved in this.  Ouch!	2005-09-17

The main character is colorless, to put it mildly (perhaps he seemed especially so because I just finished a book by Rick Copp, whose protagonist is particularly interesting), the motivation for the characters' actions never quite rings true (the \\"solution\\" to the mystery was especially disappointing), and the characters themselves are neither fully-developed enough to be interesting nor weird enough to be entertaining.<br /><br />The book is really more of a soap opera than a mystery: it's full of family business intrigue, issues of incest, long-buried secrets, and other soap-opera business.  If you like Passions, you might enjoy this one!	2005-07-01

I thought my teen years were filled with angst, but they were calm and blissful compared to what goes on in this book!  The characters stumble through the world in a haze of drugs and alcohol, unable to express their emotions except in verbal and physical violence.  Is this supposed to be a picture of what teens go through today (if so, heaven help us!), or is it just intended as a snapshot of Hawaiian surfer-punk culture?  In either case, the characters were so off-the-wall that I found it hard to build up much interest.  The ending is a little puzzling... does Sam commit suicide?  I couldn't tell, and, sadly, didn't really care.<br /><br />The author could have used a good editor, as some reviewers have pointed out.  Sam and Clay go on a backpack and somehow manage to carry a gigantic tent so big that you can stand up in it with your arms over your head and your fingers barely touching the ceiling (and the same tent is elsewhere referred to as a pup tent... hmmm...).  And the author never identifies the speaker in dialog (apparently this is now considered trendy style).  Usually it's obvious, of course, but there were whole pages where I had a hard time figuring out who was saying what.  Authors, give us a break, please!	2005-06-18

It's not William Faulkner, but the writing is competent. Even though the characters do represent a variety of archetypes, they're not just cardboard figures, but came across as interesting individuals.<br /><br />The idea that this book is going to corrupt teenagers is absurd.  Nobody who watched the news during the Monica Lewinsky era is going to learn anything new here!  And the book certainly doesn't glorify \\"rainbow parties\\": quite the opposite.  There's a good deal of frank talk about sex, but the book isn't smutty or pornographic.  It actually comes across as a strong endorsement of abstinence, since the risks (emotional and otherwise) of irresponsible sex are emphasized.	2005-06-13

Reading books like this is one of those guilty pleasures that I have to confess to.  And Frank knows her stuff... I felt that this was probably a roman a clef, but even without the clef in hand, the book is hugely entertaining (though it does bog down just a bit by the time you get to page 400).

I read this mostly out of curiosity, to see what in the world a &quot;Hip-hop novel&quot; might be. The book turned out to be highly readable (I'd call it a Philadelphia version of Trainspotting, perhaps). The plot is a bit preposterous at times (but the same could be said of Charles Dickens...), but it's never boring. The book could have used a glossary: I eventually figured out that &quot;aight&quot; is two syllables (&quot;all right&quot;), but I'm still wondering what a &quot;jawn&quot; is (it seems to be applicable to virtually anything!!)	2004-07-30

Things aren't so simple, as this book makes clear. The author is no right-winger, and he presents a clear and highly-readable description of what's going on today in Israel and the territories, and some poignant pictures of ordinary people on both sides, caught in the crossfire.  There's plenty of blame to go around: the Israeli authorities are depicted as arrogant, all too often incompetent, and given to cronyism, but most of the trouble, the author convincingly shows, is to be laid at the feet of Arafat.  Is a peaceful solution possible while he's around?  I'm not optimistic.	2004-05-18

If any such thing was present, it was too subtle for my eye, alas.  But the book is an enjoyable and easy-to-read story about a college freshman trying to decide whether he's gay or not. The narrator comes across as a bit whiny (I couldn't really get involved in the family crisis of whether he'll need to dip into the family trust fund to finish college!). The intended audience seems to be young adult, and I'd recommend it as a sensible and sensitive treatment of the usual gay coming-of-age issues.	2004-05-18

Their 5-night hike is described in great detail, along with flashbacks to trips they took all the way back to 1929.<br />  I hiked this section last year and recommend the book to anybody who has been through the Mahoosucs (or plans to).  It's probably more interesting to read after hiking than before, to compare their trip with yours.<br />  The most interesting aspect is seeing how things have changed since 1966.  Many of the sheer rock climbs they did (near Goose Eye... or is it Goose High?..., for example) now have ladders.  Hiking techniques have changed a bit (they brought an axe, thought about uprooting bushes to make a campsite, used balsam boughs in shelters, etc.): this is pre-LNT!  And they were alone for days at a time (not likely in early September nowadays).<br />  A fascinating description of a tough hike (I take my hat off to the late Mr. Doan and his friend Claud).	2004-03-27

Hmmm... a gay history where Victoria de los Angeles gets referenced 6 times in the index, and Samuel Delany doesn't make it at all (but Marilyn Hacker does!)?<br />What the book really is is a collection of opinionated comments on life and culture (some of it gay) by Harold Bloom's favorite author (I should have been warned in advance by Bloom's effusive jacket blurb about \\"the McCourt\\").  Only about half the book makes sense (and I suspect it will be a different half, depending on the reader), but since it's over 500 pages, you can read the half that makes sense to you and skip the rest and still get your money's worth.<br />There are some oddities in the book, perhaps reflecting a lack of editing.  What are we to make of the reference to Rock Hudson's wife Phyllis Yates (106)?  Is this a typo (but the indexer doesn't catch it)? A trick of memory (there but for my surname go I)?  Or another of the imaginary characters which people the book, like Diana Devors (220-221)?<br />Is McCourt's discussion of alcoholism (378-9) just wrongheaded?  Or is it a deliberate parody of pomo jargonism?  Which of the many \\"interviews\\" in the book actually took place (in \\"real life\\" rather than the author's head)?  Beats me! I confess to finding the book infuriating at first, but eventually charming.	2004-01-18

But nothing could be further than the truth.  The author has serious academic qualifications, and the press is associated with the United Church of Christ.  The idea that Jesus could be involved in a homoerotic relationship is startling, to put it mildly, but the book makes an excellent case.  Even if one doesn't fully accept the book's conclusions, there's a lot of thought-provoking textual analysis, especially on Jesus's attitude toward the Law, and to so-called &quot;family values&quot; issues (I suspect He would be quite dismayed to see how the Religious Right has hijacked debate in this area).	2003-06-05

When the authors talk about &quot;car-hiking&quot;, their emphasis is on &quot;car&quot;, rather than &quot;hiking&quot;.  What they've done is to visit places where the AT crosses roads (in many places without actually getting out of the car: some of the road crossings they depict don't even have parking available) and take pictures. Not surprisingly, many of the pictures are of freeway overpasses, road signs, and such!<br />The Appalachian Trail was conceived as &quot;A footpath for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness&quot;. This is not what you'll find here: the book deals with the AT at its worst, rather than at its best.  The authors didn't try to visit every road crossing, but (somewhat arbitrarily) decided to visit the first and last crossings in each state, major river crossings, Interstate Highway crossings, and a few other &quot;key&quot; places.  Why anyone would want to do this, I confess, is something of a mystery to me, but then many of my friends think it's a mystery why anyone should want to hike the Trail. To each his own.	2003-01-09

She's still a lot more lively than almost anybody a quarter her age. No ghost is credited, and it would seem that this book is, in fact, directly from the pen of Ms. Channing.  It certainly sounds like her: the book reads like an extended interview, delivered in her inimitable voice (which I kept hearing while reading it). It's lots of fun to read, but probably best enjoyed in short bits, since the high energy level of the writing is almost too much to take after an hour or two! She bounces around madly from topic to topic, but that's part of the charm.  A few personal notes: I grew up in a Christian Science family, and we knew the Channings (and I remember as a child visiting the First Reader's house which she describes).  Her hilarious account of the foibles of Lady Astor will resonate with any Christian Scientist from that period! When Gentlemen Prefer Blondes appeared on Broadway, I remember a bit of a scandal in C.S. circles over her performance: not because of the naughty escapades of Lorelei Lee, but because she smoked a cigarette on stage!

Worth reading even if you totally disagree with everything Ms. Fallaci says, for the sheer intensity of expression.  It's destined to join the short-list of classic rants.  She did her own translation, and her sometimes fractured English contributes a good deal to the effect.  I was sent to the dictionary more than once (and discovered, to my surprise, that &quot;parvises&quot; actually is an English word).  The odd hyphenation adds even mo-re to the effect.<br />Be that as it may, one must admit that she makes some telling points.  It seems that every day's news brings some new Moslem outrage -- the attacks on Pim Fortuyn and Bertrand Delanoe are, I fear, just the beginning of the religion's crusade (or, as Fallaci puts it, &quot;anti-crusade&quot;) against the values of pluralistic societies, especially in Europe (but America's day is coming). Her occasional homophobic comments are a bit grating: American society &quot;deifies&quot; homosexuality, she says...  Hello?.	2002-11-01

It's perhaps significant that all the jacket blurbs are from teachers at southern colleges or right-wing columnists (or both). The war was all the fault of the North, and the South can do no wrong... all the atrocity stories are trotted out (there are five pages on the burning of Columbia, but you won't find any mention of the burning of Chambersburg or Lawrence by Confederates). Writers who disagree with his views are tarred with the brush of &quot;leftism&quot;. The title seems to imply that we'll hear new revelations about Lincoln's iniquity, but the book's just a summary of secondary source material.  On the plus side, it's clearly written and a good place to go to find a presentation of the extreme pro-Southern view of the war.

Of course, O'Nan's skill in creating characters makes up for a lot of grimness (though it would be nice to read a slightly more cheerful book by him).

The authors explain the differences between the various fundamentalist factions and sub-factions (Haredim, Shas, NRP, Kookists, Gush Emunim, etc., etc... and the black vs. knit skullcaps), who often put more energy into battling each other and other Jews than they do against the Palestinians.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is that it draws almost entirely on Israeli sources in Hebrew, rather than the self-censoring and often apologetic English-language press which attempts to put as good a light on things as possible, largely for the benefit of the diaspora.  I was unaware, for example, of the extent of open rejoicing among fundamentalists (and many other Israelis) over the Patriarch's Cave massacre and the murder of Rabin; and the role of &quot;magic amulets&quot; in election campaigns.  Alas, the book does not make one optimistic about the prospects for reaching peace through rational discussion.	2000-10-12

I'd heard the book  recommended by several people that I'd hiked with in Maine, and it lived up  to the recommendations, and more so. A simple story, but surprisingly  moving. Read it if you plan to climb Katahdin (or climb anywhere above  treeline, in the Whites, for example): beware, this could happen to you!  My only reservation, at the risk of sounding like an grump, is that the  writing style leaves a bit to be desired: I thought I'd scream if the  author used the word &quot;fellow&quot; once more! Did kids really talk  like this in 1939?	2000-09-13

A  fascinating series of case studies.  But I must agree with the previous  reviewer that there are problems with editing: &quot;prosopography&quot; is  misspelled throughout -- eek!	2000-09-05

The authors are  especially thorough in their discussion of Mallory's sexuality, a subject  that other biographies either ignore (like the proverbial elephant in the  living room) or equivocate on. Their study of letters of the Bloomsbury set  (including Mallory's own) pretty much settles the issue: the cover  photograph is perhaps a hint of the revelations to come.  The book  concentrates on Mallory's personal life more than on the details of his  last climb (readers interested in the vexed debate over whether he made the  summit or not will be better served by Anker and Robert's or Hemmleb's  books), but one couldn't ask for a better treatment of Mallory's character.  One oddity: the index entries relating to pages 20-40 are jumbled (see,  e.g. the entry for Graham Irving), perhaps indicating that major changes  were made in this section after the book was in page proof?  A puzzlement!	2000-08-29

Needs to be read slowly: sentences are often put together in a way that brings the story to a halt and forces you to read them two or three  times. My favorite is on p. 124: &quot;Colored floodlights bathed the front  of the complex aqua.&quot;  Love it or hate it! Reading an O'Nan novel is  like watching a train wreck in slow motion.

A useful antidote for those sunny TV ads touting antidepressants. There are some amusing parts, such as the description of Eli Lilly's Orwellian  attempt to rename &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; as &quot;antidepressant  discontinuation syndrome&quot; in its insistance that Prozac isn't  habit-forming.  But mostly it's just scary to think of general  practitioners handing out these drugs like feel-good candy to patients who  are unaware of the serious side-effects.  Maybe the scariest thing of all  is the vituperation from doctors reviewing the book here.  Glenmullen isn't  condemning Prozac outright, but calling for more caution in prescribing it,  and better-informed patients. The book is also most enlightening in showing  how HMOs corrupt good medical practice by encouraging the misuse of these  serotonin-boosters.	2000-08-11

Books	5	17	25	N	Y	Convincing treatment of a sensitive subject	This book is the most convincing refutation that I've seen of the claim that there was no systematic Nazi plan to murder Europe's Jews, and the  most penetrating analysis of why some people make that claim.  Shermer and  Grobman are to be commended for dealing with the subject from the  standpoint of historiography, avoiding the shrill ad hominem arguments that  are, alas, all too frequent in this sensitive area, and for making an  attempt to figure out exactly why people believe what they do. Their  analysis of David Irving is especially enlightening: Irving is certainly an  intelligent man, and doesn't appear to be a vicious anti-Semite.  The  authors' explanation of how this otherwise sensible historian was led down  the garden path by the ex-Nazi &quot;in crowd&quot; is one of the most  interesting, and thoroughly convincing parts of the book.	2000-08-07

He obviously knows all the insiders, though, and I suppose it's important to have all this stuff  written down while the old-timers are still around who remembers AA's  earliest days.<br />There are some peculiar errors: on p 61, Hartigan  describes Bill's entering Towns Hospital on his sobriety date, Nov. 11,  1934. But on p. 55, he describes the ill-fated golf trip to Staten Island  (which happened several weeks or months before Bill got sober) as also  taking place on Nov. 11, 1934: clearly not just a typo, since the point of  this story is that it took place on Armistice Day.  Something is wrong  here, and I'm still trying to figure it out!<br />It's unfortunate that this  book has the same title as Robert Thomsen's much more comprehensive (and  better, in my view) bio of Bill W., and might be confused with it.	2000-07-29

Whatever happened to the smoke-free society we were supposed to have by 2000? The author's thesis (which he convincingly backs up with facts and figures) is that we've been bamboozled by the tobacco industry.  Instead of  the sensible campaigns (led by Everett Koop, for example) to make smoking  (by anybody!) socially inappropriate, which actually did bring smoking  down, the tobacco folks are now concentrating on a campaign to criminalize  teenage smoking..... this gets adult smokers off the hook and has actually  increased teenage smoking by making it an &quot;adult&quot; thing to do! No  wonder Philip Morris sponsors all those anti-teen-smoking ads: they've  actually increased smoking more than the old cigarette ads did!

I caught the author's Smithsonian talk on C-SPAN and ordered the book with the hope that his book  might be as interesting to read as he was to listen to, and was not disappointed.<br />The reader is warned... the book is written  in a most peculiar style, (perhaps &quot;droll&quot; would be the best  description), with incessant punning and quirky turns of expression,  constantly skirting the threshold between delight and annoyance.<br />Mr Marks  must have been a most vexing individual to work with (especially since he  is almost always right, at least in his recollection of the events!), but I  never tired of hearing about his exploits, and my jaw dropped more than  once (in particular when reading of his statistical analysis of the cause  for the 48 major errors made by the FANY ladies!)	2000-02-02

I had an uneasy feeling that  most of the variation (and statistical significance) resulted from data in  a single state (Florida), but without the data, it was impossible to check  this.<br />Lott also doesn't give sufficient attention to the question of  causality (he only gets to this in a brief discussion on page 153, with  quite a bit of hand-waving). The lay reader may be misled by phrasing like  &quot;due to&quot; in some of the tables. Correlation doesn't imply  causation (any student is aware of the classic &quot;notorious cases&quot;:  beer consumption correlating with church attendance, etc, etc....). It may  well be that there is some underlying and difficult-to-measure demographic  cause at work here (a &quot;get tough on crime&quot; mentality, for  example), and Lott doesn't give enough attention to this.<br />However.......  in order to show that right-to-carry laws are appropriate, it isn't  necessary to show that they deter crime: it would be sufficient to show  that they don't significantly *increase* gun violence, and Lott has  certainly proved that point.	2000-01-20

I started this book halfway expecting a dry, jargon-filled academic analysis, and was pleasantly surprised. The book reads like a series of brilliantly clear and thought-provoking lectures in a course on this  remarkable book... the kind of lectures where the prof gets applauded at  the end (I envy the students at the U. of Auckland who can take Prof. B's  courses!) He starts with the simple puzzles of the book (the ones that most  readers figure out on their own, such as who V. Botkin is) and then takes  the reader through a series of rereadings, and re-rereadings, eventually  presenting his solution to the central problem of the book (I won't spoil  the suspense by saying what it is, but it made sense to me). Probably the  best aspect of the book is the guidance it gives about what to look for  when you re-reread Pale Fire on your own. An example of what literary  criticism ought to be!	1999-12-17

Cornwall doesn't parrot Hochhuth's play (The Deputy); he takes  great pains to point out how unfair Hochhuth was to the papacy. He  translates Mit brennender Sorge correctly, if not literally (&quot;With  Deep Anxiety&quot;, p. 181). The cover picture is correctly identified as  dating from 1927... and he does discuss the efforts which the Vatican made  in rescuing Jews during the war.<br />The title is a bit sensationalistic  (probably intended to sell more books). As Cornwell clearly states, Pacelli  was no friend of Hitler's. It's easy to sit in our armchairs 50 years later  and second-guess what he should have done during the war, but I don't think  anyone is entitled to demand someone else's martyrdom. Surrounded by  Fascist Italy, and with at least one Nazi plot to kidnap him, one can  hardly blame Pacelli for not coming down on the side of the Allies. I think  there's room to give him the benefit of the doubt (which Cornwell, alas  doesn't) that he felt that maintaining neutrality was the best strategy  (for both the papacy and the world), and sincerely believed what he said,  that protests would have caused more harm than good in the long run.	1999-10-27

Where were the editors and fact-checkers?? Some of the  errors are just silly: &quot;water weighs about sixty pounds a square  foot&quot; (!). Some of them are confusing: one tablet of Potable-Aqua  &quot;should disinfect about 16 liters of murky water&quot; (the label  calls for 2 tablets per quart!). It's not correct that 7.5-minute topos  always have 20-foot contour lines (in fact, it varies, depending on local  terrain). The advice on overheating is potentially life-threatening, since  it doesn't give the simple and clear diagnostics that you'll find in any  first-aid manual between heat prostration (pale and clammy... rest and  drink fluids) and heatstroke (red and hot... call an ambulance, rather than  fanning yourself, as the author recommends!).

And the  retired teacher in me was appalled at the errors in grammar and spelling:  &quot;pouring&quot; over reports... clothes on &quot;hangars&quot; ...  wounds full of &quot;puss&quot; ... computer tapes are  &quot;overridden&quot;.

(2) Bombing the rail lines to Auschwitz would have saved  Jewish lives... (3) American guilt about failure to rescue Jews was an  important factor in US support for the State of Israel in 1948... (4) The  very existence of Israel was in peril during the 1967 and 1973  wars...<br />Novick argues (convincingly to me) that these, and a bunch of  other things that I'd always assumed, are simply wrong. And I'm not just  talking about the &quot;soap factory&quot; stories. The &quot;political  message&quot; of the Holocaust (like most other things) often doesn't have  much to do with &quot;historical truth&quot;.<br />An earlier reviewer  comments on the issue of the uniqueness of the Holocaust: actually, Novick  does discuss this issue at some length, arguing convincingly that the whole  issue is quite vacuous... uniqueness is a rhetorical rather than a  historical matter.<br />I'm a little surprised that there hasn't been more of  a media uproar over this book: it's a lot *more* controversial than  Goldhagen's book of a few years ago (Hitler's Willing Executioners).

Jim Wickwire is certainly one of the top climbers of recent years, but he doesn't seem to have had much fun doing it! This book dwells at great length on one disaster and failure after another (on and off the  mountains), while skipping over many of Wickwire's successful climbs, often  with a comment over what a letdown it was after reaching the summit. And  the part of the book about his greatest triumph (the K2 ascent) ends up  being mostly about bickering among the team members! My suspicion (just a  guess) is that the negative slant may be largely the fault of his  co-author.  Incidentally, peeking ahead while reading, I saw the picture of  Wickwire's wife near the end, and was fully expecting the last chapter to  be about her filing for divorce! To my surprise, she hasn't (she's willing  to put up with more than I would have, I guess), but I wish Jim more  enjoyment from his retirement from climbing than he had from his climbing.	1999-07-10
