US	52817643	RCW0H134TT2EM	039915275X	455930514	Captain Alatriste	Books	2	6	9	N	N	Forced and predictable	I really like some of Perez-Reverte's earlier work, but this falls short.  It reads like it was well planned; follows adventure formulas, sets up characters for future books, well researched historically.  It is technically very well crafted, but lacks a true spark or fire.  The characters seemed too much like characters.  As if the author was not captured by the fire of a story he wanted to tell, but instead coldly decided it was time to do an swashbuckler and mapped it all out. And there is an annoying amount of poetry laced throughout.	2005-06-26

He weaves history in with the modern, and for someone who has been to Rome, the observations are spot on, even though they were written in the 1950s (his comment about Roman drivers is still very true today, absolutely on the mark, and poetic in his analysis).  I read some of the book while I was in Rome; very much enjoyed reading it after I returned, and reread the parts I had read when there.  This would also make a great book for an armchair traveler.  This is travel writing at its very best.	2005-04-17

Paris is a city to be seen by walking, but being an old city, the streets can be small, tight, meadering, and dense sometimes. Don't be embarrassed to pull out a map on the street corner to get your bearings, and when you do, pull this map out. <br />It is plastic laminated, so spills or rain or wear won't smudge the details. Refolds easily in a different pattern so as to keep area of interest to the fore. Great detail, easy to read, very useful. There is a subway map on the back, it is workable, but when you get to Paris, tear out a full page subway map from one of the many tourist magazines lying around.	2005-04-10

The tours laid out in this book contain references to small cafes and shops and restaurants that none of the others do. Portable enough to carry with, the drawings of such sites as the AyaSofia are excellent; it is pretty to look at, educational, useful and easy to carry. The current version is very up-to-date on one of the most fascinating cities anywhere. Excellent book, wonderful city.	2004-10-06

Maps and drawings are great; cutways of castles and homes very interesting; sections on history and culture excellent. The book divides Scotland into geographical regions, describing the climate and terrain of each, the highlights of the area, sites to see; even walking or touring maps to follow.  Perfect for an overview of the country as a whole, and if you are planning to travel there, use this book to narrow down the parts of the country you want to visit and then get more specific information on them.  Hard to believe there is this much good information in a 200 page book. A classic Eyewitness Travel Guide.	2004-10-05

The bulk of the book is photographs, which suffer from 3 major problems. First, the paper used is matte paper, not glossy, so even the photos taken in bright sunlight have a dull appearance (some of the photos are taken in shadows, as if the photographer did not want to come back later to get a good shot).  Secondly, the photos do not support the text:  With 17 pages of text and 60 or so of photos, you would think that when the text is describing Gaudi's invention and use of the parabolic arch there would be some photos near by to show what they are talking about.  Thirdly, a poor choice of photos which are not labeled as to what they are, you have to look all the way in the back to find out what the photo is of (there is a full two page photo of Casa Mila, and the entire photo is out of focus. Unexcusable.) <br />Basically, average text with photos thrown in without thought to the whole, disguised as being hip with colored paper and hard to read quotations.  If you are very interested in Gaudi, the best analysis of him I have found yet is the last 90 pages or so of Robert Hughes' book Barcelona, learned and insightful.	2004-08-21

With a distinct style at a time when the magazine was trying making a name for itself, Bensimon was much of the reason the mag was successful, with his eye catching front covers, strong, bright, new style fashion photography.  His use of colour, his camera anlges, his composition, the obvious fact that he liked women and all their parts, his willingness to take risks (if they all showed up for a shoot and it was raining, instead of waiting for the perfect light he would shoot in the rain and print those in the magazine, something not done before, and the shots were good); all these combined to set him ahead of the other photographers of that time.  He would shoot photos with a very narrow plane of foucus so that in a tight shot the end of the model's nose and her ear are out of foucus, but the plane in between with her eyes and the expensive beautiful necklace would be in foucs.  He would shoot in colour and print in black & white.  He used two softlights that gave the photographs a distinct lighting look.<br />But he was at this best with the use of colour and the beauty of women.  The photographs of that period made an impact, sold magazines, yet he stayed in the background while lesser skilled photographers like Patrick Demarchalier sold books and pushed their name out into the public eye.  Bensimon's work was the strongest of any photographer during that time period, and his fans have been waiting almost 20 years for his first book.  With the size of this book the pages are actually larger than the magazine pages the photographs were originally meant for, the paper quality is very good, so the photos can really be appreciated. Unfortunately, he left out a lot of his best work.<br />His most creative dynamic period mid-1980s to 1993 or so, is very poorly represented here with only 18 pages of the 220 some in the book. None of the strong colour cover shots of that time period, the very creative settings, the genius composition (the most famous of which is laying 6 or 7 models with side by side in alternating directions, each with a different bold coloured bathing suit).  Only two photos of Rachel Williams, which his work with her could have filled an entire whole book. He discovered Claudia Schiffer, he worked so well with Elle McPherson they were married for a while; yet there is only one photo each of those models.  Too many of the photographs are from the last 3-4 years, maybe half the book.<br />The photographs are very good, the book is good, but they are not his best photographs, not the ones that make you pick up the book over and over again. The front cover says it all:  When the first impression should be his bold vibrant surprising style in the manner of the type of magazine covers he was famous for, he choose an out-of-focus black and white.  I hope he hurries to get out a book that covers the period of the 80s and 90s only. There is a lot of very strong work that did not get into this book that should have been here.	2004-08-15

Extremely well written, with lots of photographs, this is an excellent book for a do it yourselfer with a project in mind, or for a home owner to keep on hand to have when the need arises. The book covers basic repairs and maintenance, with a not too complicated introduction to electricity, but quickly gets down to the basics, with chapters on Wall Switches, Receptacles, Light Fixtures, Doorbells & Thermostats.  The second half covers how to do more complicated electrical tasks. The first half is repair and maintenance, the second half moves into renovation and remodeling, with chapters on project planning, tools & techniques, Wiring a Room Addition, Wiring a Remodeled Kitchen, Installing Outdoor Wiring, etc. From this book I learned how to install new breakers in the main fuse panel, a project I was terrified of trying. This really is a very good book for the non-professional.  It was a good idea to combine the two books into one, a handy reference and guide	2004-08-06

The book begins with the Australian author's third and most recent wedding in the 700 year old town hall by the mayor of the city he has loved for 30 some years. A thorough knowledge of the history, culture, art, and politics of Barcelona presented with wit, keen observation, and an open fondness.

Here that would be the first 100 pages and the last 120, of the 574 pages which reveal that the Catlans are not Spanish, but Catalan; their art, architecture and politics come from their history of being with or against the rest of Spain, having their own language and culture, with economic/political battles against Madrid from early Roman history to today (Beckham was going to Barcelona F.C. before Real Madrid stole him away at the last second).  I imagine he started with the idea of writing a book about the fantastic Art Nouveau architecture in one of the most architecturally interesting cities in the world, to discover that the Catalan spirit was such a force in shaping the uniqueness of the style that more needed to understood about who these people with their own language and culture that is sometimes banned by the national government.  Unfortunately the author goes too deep in cataloging the complexities of the history of Barcelona, some of which is just not that interesting, the large middle of the book saps the reader's strength.  The text comes alive again for the ending sections on the late 1800s when Barcelona was the bomb throwing anarchy capital of the world leading into the development of the Art Nouveau/Modernista movement, although slowing a bit before finishing with a really excellent examination and comment of Gaudi, the person and his work.  <BR>Mr Hughes needed a stronger editor for this book, it would be a brilliant 250 page book.   Some severe editing to take out the boring but academic sections was really needed.<BR>That said, it is worth reading.  Scim the middle sections. When Hughes is on his game it is good reading	2004-06-19

Her notes and thoughts through the journey are fascinating and revealing.  Her insights into St. Theresa are original and enlightening, her discussion of the Roman remains in Merida are very interesting reading. In a few short paragraphs lays out why the Muslin religion took hold so well when it did, a description that is simple that I have not seen anywhere else. She takes her facts and transcends them into clear understanding in an impressive way. Without speaking the language she has the feel for the people and conveys it quite well.  The last couple chapters tail off in strength, but the book is a definite read for anyone who has been to Spain and is in love with the country.  Remarkable piece of work.	2004-05-24

It can give you a sense of how far Loch Ness really is from Edinburgh, points out the scenic roads, main roads, back roads; has good detail on the islands; and covers from the border with England up to the top of the country.  Any specific city  like Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, etc, will require a more detailed map, obtained locally, but this map is very good for planning and getting around.  Main thing to remember, you can end up going much slower in the Highlands than you think, in some areas 25 mph average speed because of the roads twisting or being single track. On the other hand, I was going 70 for a while, keeping up with traffic, in a glen above Loch Lommond.  The roads are in good condition, and driving on the left is not the hardest thing about driving in Britian; it is getting used to how narrow the lanes are.

The classic DK/Eyewitness travel guide for Paris covers so much material it is almost too heavy to carry around all day. I left the heavier guide in the hotel room, reading in the morning or evening about places we had been or were going, took this Top Ten guide out with us, along with the excellent Insight Fleximap, having put post-it-notes in the Top Ten guide if there was some additional data for the day (for example, the Top Ten guide mentions nothing about the Catacombs). <BR>This is not the book to get in depth historical or architectural information, but handy for use in the street.	2002-04-20

The &quot;Ten Simple Rules of Dining in Paris&quot; in the begining along with the introduction comments are very good, they will serve you well to help make eating in Paris less stress free. The 25 pages of eating place recommendations is of less use, considering how many there are in Paris this is a very small sample. Near the Sacre-Coeur their recommeded cafe turned out to be a shabby affair with curious looking characters hunched over their rundown tables, which sat directly accross from a more relaxed less rundown place that we felt more comfortable eating at, which had fine food. You have to decide for yourself.<BR>The book is worth taking with you.  Paris is thick with places to eat, making it easier to just duck in anywhere with this wonderful little guide to manners and translation.  Don't rely too much on the recommendations as the only places to eat at.  It would have been nice if they had included a few paragraphs about the different types of wine.	2002-04-10

Paris is a city to be seen by walking, but being an old city, the streets can be small, tight, meadering, and dense sometimes. Don't be embarrassed to pull out a map on the street corner to get your bearings, and when you do, pull this map out.<BR>It is plastic laminated, so spills or rain or wear won't smudge the details. Refolds easily in a different pattern so as to keep area of interest to the fore. Great detail, easy to read, very useful. There is a subway map on the back, it is workable, but when you get to Paris, tear out a full page subway map from one of the many tourist magazines lying around.	2002-04-08

It is gorgeous, lush, dense with illustrations.  Knopf does the best job on items like flora, fauna, architecture, history, art, how the city has been seen by others, its fashion legacy, street life, medieval influence, sub-cultures, music, and so on, each topic at least a two page spread that is always satisfying to the eyes. <BR>A guided walking tour is the standard Knopf format for revealing the city, as opposed to the Eyewitness itemized number format. The Eyewitness guide is the other half of the pair that you must have to visit Paris, each complementing the other rather than competing. This Knopf guide has some gorgeous pull out maps/pages in the middle of the book that are really great. <BR>The Knopf weakness is in it's ability to help you plan: There is a wonderful diagram of the Catacombs, on a fold out page showing details about the fascinating sites beneath the city, with pictures of some of the bones in the Catacombs; but nowhere will the Knopf guide tell you what time it is open or when. The Eyewitness guide is much stronger in that respect, the Knopf guides are almost as good as the Eyewitness when it comes to maps, the Eyewintness being better. <BR>The Knopf guide has 7 pages of general index plus 10 pages for listing illustrations. The Eyewitness guide has 20 pages of general index with none for illustrations, which is to say the Knopf guide is more romantic, the Eyewitness guide more practical, they are 5 star both, and you should have both.	2002-03-16

Here is Mapplethorpe's ultimate genius, astoundingly powerful from such simple set-ups. The colour, composition, lighting, choice of vases and flowers: All the basics but brilliantly done. <BR>  I saw Mapplethorpe's famous exhibition in Philadelphia just before he died,the exhibit that was banned at the Corcoran in D.C., then siezed for a while in Cincinnati.  The flower photographs were dye-transfer prints, which made the colour surprisingly intense; some were almost 3' tall. People would stand for a long time in front of those, enraptured, sensing the work on several different levels at once.  This book does a good job of bringing that to you.  You can look at this book over and over again, put in on a coffe table to start converstaions or, after having not seen it for a while, rediscover it to be awed and inspired anew once again.<BR>   The edition I have is a 1990 paperback 12&quot; in height; the pictures are presented one to a spread, so that there is a blank white page accross from the flower, which is a very classy touch, completely the correct way to do it.	2002-02-03

Great photographs, laid out well, great information on each of the castles/chateauxs, lots of photos of the inside decoration and furniture. This book gave me a better understanding of the landscaping around the castles as well.  If you are planning to visit the Loire valley, and you are trying to decide which castles to visit, this book is a must. It is also and excellent armchair-traveller/coffee-table book.	2002-01-01

Christopher Columbus waited for 6 years before Queen Isabell would give him ships, she made him wait until the  Moors were driven out of Spain.  When the Alhambra finally falls, Coloumbus is given permission and ships for his quest a few days later, and the next year the Spanish Inquisition starts. <BR>All of this comes to you if you visit the very romantic/historic city of Granada and the Alhambra, and after seeing the Alhambra restored, having walked its rooms and grounds, having listened to the fountains, letting your immagination run, then read this book, after you return home.  Washington Irving's stunt of taking up residence in the rundown, forgotten Alhambra of his time seems even more fantastic.  In fact, if you are going to Spain, buy a copy of this book in Granada; they are sold everywhere in different languages, and have pictures of paintings done in the period around Irving's stay.  If you haven't been to the Alhambra, you should go.	2001-11-10

It is easy to use, updated with current words, has very good information on what they call Language Building Supplements, such as how to do correspondence, using the telephone, translation tips, conjugating verbs, etc.. This dictionary would be good for a college freshman, senior, or someone like me who is just working on trying to learn the language.	2001-10-30

Such information as the geography, animals, different ethnic groups within the Maya, how the commuinities are structrured, festivals, musical instruments, furniture, food, and alot more.  The format for the guide is 2 or more pages on each topic, lots of drawings, or paintings, or photos (new and old).  The book uses lots of colour, is fascinating to go through even after you have read it.  It has some helpful tourist information as to hotels, shops, restaurants, but is not a primary source for booking reservations information.  If you have any interest in this area or these people, this is a great book to have for a really good price. It is a treat to look at.	2001-10-20

The recipes are easy to follow, measurements in English and metric, with a helpful notation about the recipe at the start of each one.  More importantly, they are useful dishes that you can acutally cook, not one of those books with 20 different ways to cook octopus. Where a particular local indgrediant is probably not available stateside, a creditable alternative is given. The book looks tasty to the eye, and the recipes are tasty as well. I am particularly fond of Turkish food and this cuisine is well represented, just as the other Mediterranean countires are.	2001-10-20

Geography, environment, and a collection of characters encountered along the way, a fascinating book on several levels.  Also in the fabric of the book is a discussion of how the Mayans keep time, what happened to them as a culture and people, as well as what their future might be.  But is it all done with excellent writing, none of it too academic or dry, all interesting, with great writing artistry.  A very good book.  Simple and powerful.  A good read if you have any interest in this area of the world or the Mayans.	2001-10-02

I got the impression that the essays were all examples of experts showing off how expert they are; very dry, lacking emotion, failing to inspire or excite.  Too analytical, all head and no heart.  For an excellent book on the modern life, living, arts, politics and all of  Spain is &quot;The New Spaniards&quot; by John Hooper.	2001-09-29

Not too much text, but what is there does a nice job of covering the history, the layout, and the essential sense of the place.  I purchased the book several months before a trip to Spain for background information. It is also good armchair travel book.  I also found that my wife loved it for a gardening book.  You can look at the photos over and over again.<br />Now that we are back from Spain, the book is an excellent reminder of a very lovely place. An interesting book from both travelling and gardening viewpoints.	2001-05-05

The first problem is a conscious decision by the author not to include a glossary of terms in the back.  The word is defined only once, &quot;From that point on, we use that phrase in Spanish in a missionary effort to encourage the non-Spanish speaker to associate the word with the concept.&quot;  In other words, the author is going to make the reader learn Spanish bullfight terms.  But oh so many terms, every possible term ever that ever applied to the bullfight, a staggering number of terms. The first 180 pages is a minefield of Spanish terms. What is so maddening, is that if you find a term on page 60 that hasn't been used since page 20, you look up the term in the index, find it is referenced to page 20, turn to page 20, and maybe it is defined in the footnote, or maybe you have to reread the entire page to find the definition, or maybe you find that, as I did several times, that although page 20 is the first use of the term, it is not defined anywhere. The author is not so much trying to teach as he is trying to show off, and the author's ego is the real theme of this book. <br />That covers the first 180 pages; the last 90 pages are worse, because of the second major flaw in the book: The author's snobish and elitsit attitude that no one can enjoy a bullfigt unless they know as much as he does, and anyone enjoying a bullfight who does not know as much is a simple peon or one of the easily duped masses; furthermore just about everybody who ever wrote anything about bullfighting was wrong.  McCormick tries to list every book and author and what was wrong and how it could have been better if they had only known as much as McCormick.<br />If you notice the book review section above, the name Hemingway is mentioned is mentioned 4 times.  That is because McCormick has an obsession to prove that Hemingway's work about bullfighting was not really that good after all. It is apparent that McCormick wants to be the new Boss of Bullfighting, it becomes comical how he goes out of is way to knock down Hemingway in this book constantly.<br />If you see at least 4 or 5 bullfights a year, this book may have some value to you. There is technical information on bulls and bull breading, the exact names of passes and styles, but it is buried far below the authors ego; you'll have to work to make it useful. I have read Hemingway's Death In The Afternoon, it's the best book so far for understanding bullfighting; unless you live in Spain or Mexico, don't bother with this one.	2001-03-17

Here is a quote from the book:   &quot;With a spot meter, you can measure the log brightness range of the subject; you know that you need a log density range of around 1.1 to make a contact print on grade 2 paper: and armed with the film manufacturer's gamma/time cures, plus a good guess at the flare factor for your lens, you can select the appropriate development time.&quot;<br />The photographs in the book are average to the point that when looking at them I'm thinking, &quot;I can do better than that.&quot;<br />The authors have a converstaional style in writing, and if you want ALOT of detail on exposure, maybe this is the book for you. There is 20 pages devoted to the chapter on film testing alone, a couple of paragraphs of which are devoted to describing the example negatives that are over/under exposed. The problem is, the negatives they are describing are in one of their other books! You would think that at 192 pages, they could at least include the examples they are refering to.<br />The key concept in the book is &quot;. . .think hard about how you want a given tone to 'read' in the final picture, and adjust your metering technique accordingly.&quot;	2001-03-03

Lots of pictures/drawings/photos, all good quality and interesting. This book is for looking at as much as reading, and it is very well done.<br />If you are going to Seville take the Eyewitness Travel Guide and this Knopf guide. Both books are very good, both colourful and easy to carrry. The Eyewitness guide has better maps, more organized information on hotels and restaurants. The Knopf guide is better on background, culture, architecture, flora and fauna, traditions and way of life. The Knopf guide also has a section, &quot;Seville as seen by painters&quot;, and a section &quot;Seville as seen by writers&quot;. <br />I would say the Eyewitness guide is more practical, the Knopf guide more romantic, both very important. You will not be disappointed that you got this book. If you are an armchair traveler, this is definitely a good book.	2001-03-03

The author lays down facts and geographies and genealogies, but all from an observed distance.  One never feels what it is like to live in those times or in that style and culture. There was no excitment; no feel for the adventure. Too dry for me.	2001-02-10

And then there is another 20 pages at the end of the \\"what to know when you travel there\\" stuff.     It is a great idea for a book, and a you should read it if going to Spain, but I just wish they had used better authors. Nothing from Hemingway, Washington Irving, nothing from the Spaniards themselves like Cervantes and Lorca. The writing seems too modern, not deep, nor funny, nor penetrating enough:  Not up to the task at hand. Although the writing is OK, there must be better insights written than these.  This could have been a better book, considering the subject is Spain, it could have been a much much better book.	2001-02-10

On each two page spread there is  one photograph that the author goes into details of what it looked like in real life, what he was thiniking about how the photo should come out, and what proceeducres he used to get there (what filters, what rules of composition, what lighting challenges, etc.). Then also on the same two page spread, another one or two photos supporting the same idea, and some additional information blurbs. It all works very well and does help one look and learn.	2001-01-28

This is not a travel book one would get to learn about hotel rooms and restaurants and tourist sites, but what a wonderful insight into the fascinating culture of Mexico. And by really good writers! The material dates from 1888 to 1978, but time is not so much the issue as insight and perspective. Top notch armchair travel book, and a good book to read before going there for background on a different culture.	2001-01-11

Spain is a beautiful and diverse country. When outside the main cities and rail lines do not be hesitant to rent a car and explore.    My review is for the Central region map.    If you are thinking about maybe renting a car when visiting the Madrid/central Spain area, get this map now. The map is perfect for showing how easy it is to get around the very beautiful and dramatic area. This part of Spain, with mountains to the north of Madrid (with Segovia and Avila), the plains to the south (with Toledo, La Mancha), craft towns to the west (Talavera de la Reina, Oropesa) are as much worth seeing as the art museums in Madrid. The driving was a pleasure; the roads well marked, in good condition and safe, traffic not a problem outside the cities (if you rent the car in Madrid, leave town immediately, do not drive a rental around the city).   From Segovia, we crossed the mountains from the Avila side to Oropesa; we saw parts of an old roman stone road still running up through the mountains, a rainbow's end in a little valley by a sheep herder's cottage, and of course a castle or two. The map led us through without problem to some dramatic, fantastic and very memorable sights.  With this map we spent one day castle hunting from our base in Toledo: Castles on hilltops, castles in towns, castles next to windmills.  We visited renovated castles and climbed through abandoned ones, saw amazing photo ops and sights to remember.   The map was perfect for the task.	2000-07-09

The drawings by Catherwood are fascinating, and the whole adventure is more amazing for being a true story.<br />This edition has been significantly edited by Ackerman, I think lessening the power of the original, which at the moment is not sold by Amazon, but this edition combines the two books into one.  5 stars for the Stephens/Catherwood book, 3 for this version of it.	1998-02-06

You must have this book beforehand. Rating each of the sites with 4 stars for the most interesting down to one star, you get great background information as well as a really good map of the site, what are it's most interesting features, and how much time you might want to spend there.  The information is very detailed, archaeological in viewpoint, but usable and interesting for tourist types.  Use this in conjuction with more current roadmap information for trip planning as the roads are always changing, but the 900 year old Pyramid of the Magician isn't going anywhere. I did not take this with me on my trip, but had gotten so much information from it that when we arrived at the sites in the morning, I already knew the site layout and which way to start so as to have the best sun for photographs. <BR>    Even the smaller 1 & 2 star sites are worth seeing if they are near your travel path, and this book does a great job on those sites which you will not find in the tourist books.  This is the only book I found that gives the pronouciation for the names of the sites in Mayan, even now I occasionally surf through the book for fun. Not a typical travel book, but well written and interesting.	1997-09-28
