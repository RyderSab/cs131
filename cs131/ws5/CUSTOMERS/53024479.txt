I give it 3.5 stars. <br /> I liked this novel.  twice I was laughing so hard tears were rolling down my cheeks (the memo including the pig truck episode was hilarious).  In general, the story  is written in the author's hip, ironic style, we know and love. <br /> The  reason it does not get four stars, is because of Stephenson's hubris.  With  this novel he has become un-editable.  There were pages  and pages of  technical minutia in this story, interesting only to uber-geeks.  I'm  reminded of a textbook exec who said: &quot;Every equation that appears in  a textbook (non-mathematics/physical science) costs 10,000 copies in  sales.&quot;  Stephenson cost himself about 100K copies here.  These  passages added nothing to the story. I ended up rapidly paging though them.   You would think an author savvy enough to write a thriller for a targetted  audience would not have included material like this.  A strong editor could  also have saved on production costs by having it removed. <br /> Finally, the  ending was a bit weak in comparison to the strong beginning and middle.  I  was disappointed that the least developed characters contributed so much to  the novel's conclusion. <br /> Still, I recommend this for Stephenson fans.	1999-05-24

This was no corny, girlie story. President Marie Arcola is one of the best characters I have read in a book  in quite a while.  Most books out on the market are old, recycled stories  of the same old stuff, over and over. Not Lady President; this one will  make you think twice about a lot of things. Although the editing took a  while to get used to, with this writers Patrick McCabe/Roddy Doyle style of  writing; try reading Shakespeare too. This Lady President would make a  great tv drama. Kind of like what Clancy tried to do with Opt Center or  Netforce.	1999-04-13

However, his arguments are rather parochial.  The proposed solution  reverses the trend of cannibalizing the Army at the expense of the other  services.  Too bad he did not take his thesis a bit further (he skirts  this) toward Luttwack's &quot;Purple-Suiter&quot; idea.

This is not his best. <br />Borrowing heavily on the background of his &quot;Chatanooga&quot; series of short stories this is a story that starts  out being written with tongue firmly in cheek.

It provided a unique introduction to the the organizational  behavior and technology influencing the development of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) up to  the &quot;The Pacific War&quot;.  <br /> The authors pursue a four pronged approach, describing how the  political history, the Japanese  culture, the organizational behavior of  the Navy, and the development of the technology &quot;grew&quot;  the IJN  and to a certain extent led the country into war with the Allies.  Techies  will appreciate  the detail provided on ship classes, including ship  diagrams.  In particular, I appreciated how  clearly the authors managed to  show how the perceptions of the IJN's commanders about &quot;how  a war  WILL be fought&quot; effected the force structure of the IJN. <br /> The book  is not without faults.  The formatting of the book is in some ways  amateurish.  The  scale of certain ship illustrations could have been  chosen more carefully.  I also found the  comparison charts very difficult  to understand, despite clear supporting prose.  Finally, The  authors could  have been more clinical in their analysis of the IJN's errors.  The  contrasts to the &quot;formidable logistics capability&quot; of the U.S.  Navy or the superb U.S. Marine amphibious assault  capability were a bit  too vivid. <br /> Navalists will value this book for its technical content and  its analysis of the decision making  that led to the birth, growth, and  demise of the IJN.  Recommended.	1999-01-27

I personally prefer the more (do I say it?)  &quot;cyberpunkish&quot; stories over the eco-disaster &quot;Drylands&quot;   stories. <br /> If I can find any fault with the author, it is in her slow  production of novels.

I had read an early review of  this book, and it sounded interesting.  However, not finding it available I  picked-up another of the author's novels  &quot;Spinsters&quot;.  I never  finished &quot;Spinsters&quot;.  However, I read &quot;Exes&quot; in two  sittings.  Its witty, hip, and breezy-a joy to read. <br /> &quot;Exes&quot;  is a character study.  The novel is split-up into parts narrated by the  emotionally flawed members of a band.  Each character tells their personal  story and in the process extends the story line.  This is a bit too arty  for me, but it's OK.  The first character Hank (lead guitar) is  exceptionally well done, and the last (Walt, the drummer) gets short  shrift.  I thought Walt was potentially the most interesting character. <br />  The only fault I can find in the novel is there should have been one more  character in the band to chronicle either the band's eventual success or  melt-down.  But, that is what you get with artsy novels; sometimes they  don't have traditional endings. <br /> Recommended, for those into hip and  witty character studies.	1998-10-08

This is what the canny author of many  factual Current Issues books did.  He re-spun what he knows how to do (I  recommend &quot;American Steel&quot;) into a novel.  However, I learned  more about: How-to-Cook-a-Bio-Weapon, the Geo-politics and history of  biological warfare, FBI police procedures, and epidemiology than &quot;mans  inhumanity to man&quot; i.e. there was really no story, or sex either. <br />  If you want to learn about epidemiology and bio-war in a &quot;Austin and  Hopkins Tell You About Science&quot; format you'll be happy with this book.   If you don't need a tissue thin story draped around this information you  might want to read Deshowitz's &quot;The Malarial Capers&quot; to get most  of the same stuff without the police procedure.	1998-10-07

The book also includes helpful maps.  <br /> However, I find fault in the presentation because it did not include a  better analysis of the effects of the trade patterns and technology on the  Company's business over time.  Instead, the book was written more in the  &quot;name dropper&quot; school of history.  Almost as many questions arise  from reading the book as were answered. <br /> For example, vast sums were  being made on voyages.  What did a pound sterling buy?  Were the amounts  quoted in the book of current value or then value?  What were the  characteristics of the frigates and Indiamen plying the eastern trade  routes?  Charts showing tonnage overtime and sailing's would have been  appreciated. <br /> This book unsuccessfully attempts to many views of the  Company at once.  Unfortunately, it does it by listing hundreds of names.   The policies of Clive and Hastings get almost as many words as an often  widowed factor's daughter.  I might recommend this book as a supplement to  readers interested in economic history, but not as a primary source.	1998-09-28

However this is the novel's only great success. <br /> I like Robinson's  writing.  However, reading his stories has always meant struggling through  his didactics.  &quot;Antarctica&quot; is the worst example to-date.  You  will be able to save yourself 100 pages by paging forward through  diversions on academic politics, minutia of the Antarctic Treaty, and long  discussions on the foibles of Antarctic historical figures. <br /> Despite  being listed as science fiction, &quot;Antarctica&quot; barely qualifies.   The story is more an action adventure thriller with a very thin veneer of  tech.  The story could just as well have been written in the context of  last Tuesday than ten years in the future. <br /> Finally, the novel is  written from a multi-character perspective.  I've never been overly fond of  this technique-it is too difficult to get right.  I don't believe Robinson  succeeds here either.  Of the three main characters (Wade, Val, and X), X  (who I thought was the most interesting) never develops and Val frankly  seemed too masculine to be a women. <br /> &quot;Antarctica&quot; is readable,  although I think his &quot;Kalifornia&quot; series is a better introduction  to his earthbound work.	1998-09-04

However, I was not satisfied with the way he weaves the threads of: a spoiled nano-technology cornucopia, a doomsday machine accidentally constructed by von Neuman machines, and direct man-machine interface (and man-man interface) into a new type of mankind lives happily ever after.  I suppose some of these themes were too precious for the author to push them into the background.  The end result is rather frayed. <br /> Still, &quot;Forever Peace&quot; is a good read.	1998-06-14

It contains his usual blend of medical and legal background themes leavened with his acerbic humor. <br /> Unlike his previous novel (&quot;Brain Storm&quot;) this is story is based more on the medical theme and less the legal.  The story is about the ethical choices a doctor working in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has to make.  Doolings style is good, and his ironic descriptions are precious.  Yet the book is serious, I'm thinking seriously about a living will after having read this. <br /> One failing I am beginning to find, is that the author only has one character.  The doctor in this story is too similar to the lawyer in &quot;Brain Storm&quot; and the Indiana insurance adjuster in &quot;White Man's Grave&quot;. <br /> Recommended for those who would like to read about an ironic Dr. Kildare.	1998-06-14

It's the latest in the who-knows-how-long-it-will-run Vorkosigan soap opera. <br /> I like Bujold, and this series is about the only one I follow.  And, there is nothing special about the series, it's a vanilla space opera, except for the characters, and the brilliant, stunted Miles is a gem.  In this particular installment Mile's may have found the love of his life.   <br /> However, how long will this series go on?  With ten books in the series, its starting to wear a bit thin. <br /> Recommended for Vorkosigan addicts as their next dose.	1998-06-14

The novel is two love stories, mild Sword n' Sorcery fantasy, and (again) mild Science Fiction.  I'm not certain what genre that places it.  I suspect the author wanted to write three novels and decided to write them all at once. <br /> &quot;Plague Tales&quot; has several good points, but in general it is just so &quot;bloated&quot;.  It runs for almost 700 pages.  This could easily have been cropped to 500, if the author had used less then three adjectives per sentence. <br /> The technology and background history are uneven.  The epidemiology is better than the history or  &quot;far view&quot; technology.  I personally wondered how the Eucalyptus tea sipped in the first chapter reached Mediaeval Span from undiscovered Australia or how one &quot;wiped out the memories completely&quot; of a PC.  In addition, the use of magic undermines the tech and a technological future the use of magic. <br /> Finally, the novel lacked &quot;hard edges&quot;.  Even grim situations are &quot;nice&quot;.  In the middle ages, life was cruel, brutish and short.  The author's middle ages read like a costume ball.  In a future ravaged by antibiotic resistant pandemics life was also cruel and short.  Yet, the Soccer Moms keep a stiff-upper lip. <br /> A good editor might have saved this novel. &quot;Plague Tales&quot; has just too many words to read to reach the few good parts. There ought to be a law that first novels be 350 pages or less.  In addition, the author spread herself too widely over too much history, characters, and technology.  There are better books to read at the beach.	1998-06-05

This story compares and contrasts the experiences of an American boy from the heartland (Indiana) with the realities of the Bush in West Africa.  It almost qualifies for science fiction. <br /> Dooling writes some funny stuff. Most of it about Lawyers (admittedly American cultural whipping boy icons).  However, I wish he'd write about something else.  The techno-lawyer background plot is growing stale. (I believe this novel is his first, with two other on the same line in print). <br /> This is better story-wise than &quot;Brain Storm&quot;, but not as quip quotable.  Keep an eye on Dooling, but  beware he may only have two stories in him.	1998-06-01

Some of these characters were rather interesting (like the androids), although most just further diluted the story.  I think the reader would have been better served with a simpler presentation providing more background. <br /> If you have been following Wilder's work in other books or magazines you will probably get a lot out of this book.

Boy takes journey, becomes a man, and rights great evil.  And, that is OK.  However, this story gets mired in several places.  The 27 year hiatus the main character takes within 50 pages of the pat ending drove me nutty. <br /> I fully expected something as original as &quot;Legacy of Herot&quot; and I found &quot;Legacy of Herot&quot; (again).	1998-04-20

The story should have been subtitled: &quot;Escape from the Meat-World&quot;. The erotic passages are not too shabby either. <br /> While the premise of the story was good, the execution of the story was horribly flawed.  The artifice of using a Courier font to represent computer output is well known.  The authors' thought to chronicle 80% the buddies' info-highway roadtrip in the context of e-mails and chat logs.  The end result was more like reading a screenplay than a novel.  Boring.  In addition, the mechanical readability of the novel was degraded by printing its 400-odd pages in a Sans Serif font.  It is tough on the eyes, over long periods. <br /> In addition to being physically difficult to read, the story suffered from long didactics on gender, an inept use of gender-less pronouns (&quot;hir&quot; and &quot;ze&quot;), an uneven application of computer lore, and a really trite ending. <br /> This book has a few interesting points.  However, it takes way too much work to find them.	1998-04-13

Joe has been harboring doubts about having sold-out and gone for the big bucks of a corporate law firm.  Some court assigned pro bono work forces him to make some major life changes. <br /> I like the way Dooling writes.  However, I don't like his market-oriented story.  His main character views the world dripping with irony.  However, this is the story's greatest fault.  The ironic narration does not stop when the main character really ought to be serious.  This failure to segue form scene to scene gives it an unintentional sit-com quality, minus the laugh track.  Another problem I had was the story's blatant info-novel orientation.  Computer geek lawyer involved in a criminal case featuring neurobiology?  About the only thing missing for total mass market appeal would be to make it a western or a war story. <br /> &quot;Brain Storm&quot; is entirely too over contrived to be a thriller.  It is clever, and humorous, but like &quot;Alley McBeal&quot; without substance.	1998-04-05

The story is well written.  It is almost cyber-punk.  Kress handles the three character perspectives well, although not perfectly.  The two male characters had (IMHO) very female perspectives.  These shaded into the &quot;true&quot; female character's.  In addition, I paged through the didactic passages on &quot;mankind fouling their own nest via better living through chemistry&quot;.  However, the story's 250-odd pages meant these sections were mercifully short. <br /> This book was a big surprise to me.  The book seemed to thin to be any good.  However, it was dense with ideas.  In a period of bloated trilogies, pre-sequels, and never-ending-stories it is an example of how a talented author can write a story and end it without requiring the readers to wait two years.  In places &quot;Maximum Light&quot; reminded me of Sterling's &quot;Holy Fire&quot; (recommended).  These two novels (&quot;Maximum Light&quot; and &quot;Holy Fire&quot;) may be the leading-edge of a gerontology sub-genre. <br /> This book is real good.  It not perfect, but &quot;real good&quot;.

He is forced to deal with the conflict of honoring his brother's wishes and his own mercenary instincts. <br /> The bond trader turned entrepreneur reminded me of Po Bronson's last two novels merged into a who-dunn-it, but without the humor.  Merging the bond trader and high-tech startup entrepreneur together and layering that on top of a mystery was too blatant a play at a info-novel for me.  And it was too predictable.  Finally, there were some quirky things about the story.  No marital relationship of the story's characters past or present either worked-out or was working out.  And the final love-interest did not appear to imply any commitment.  Hmmm? <br /> This book is OK, but there are better things to read.	1998-03-30

The story was well written and entertaining. <br /> But, it wasn't perfect.  Egan wrote about machine resident human personalities in &quot;Permutation City&quot;.  &quot;Diaspora&quot; to a large extent is a re-spin of this idea.  It is well done, but he's been there before.  The story also has long didactical passages on quantum physics.  Fans of Robert Forward may salivate over these, I was bored to tears.  Finally, &quot;Diaspora&quot; addresses 5000 or so years due to time dilation.  Anything longer than a week is just &quot;a long time&quot; in fiction's fourth dimension. <br /> Bottom line is I like it.  &quot;Diaspora&quot; is good and well worth reading, despite its small faults.	1998-03-23

Then you have the story. These multiple contexts eventually doomed it. <br /> I read the UK edition. So, when Smith's (a Brit)American main character on location outside of Richmond, VA, USA starts refering to elevators as &quot;lifts&quot; and behavior being &quot;a bit Naff&quot; (among other cultural artifacts) I wondered if the character's was not Dr. Who in disguise?  My guess is that interdimensional portals spewing zombies; drug-crazed, law enforcment officers; flying malls as metaphores for the economic caste system; gunship flying C3POs; and organ-legging cannot occur in Surrey.  Did I leave out the kind hearted hooker?      <br /> The story was amusing, gritty, surreal, and one continuous cliche. &quot;Spares&quot; is a parody on noir.

You are required to wade through page after page of meta-mystical metaphores, before coming upon scenes that are like nuggets of gold. <br /> If you have a hankering to read this author, pass this one up and read &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot; instead.	1998-03-16

Buying into the series meant accepting a formula Space Opera: Space-ninja Joshua Wolfe gambles, fights, and fornicates his way across the galaxy.  &quot;Wind After Time&quot; and &quot;Hunt the Heavens&quot; held true to this formula, and were actually pretty good space battle, ray blaster, and bodice-ripper sf. <br /> &quot;Darkness&quot; was a disappointment.  I can only imagine Bunch had a three book contract, and either ran out of story by the end of the second book or had too much to put in the third.  This final book picks up where the second book left-off. It then mindlessly recycles the plot of the first book in the series, with the names changed.  Finally, it wraps-up the series in the last 50 pages.  If I'd known the series was going to end that abruptly and unsatisfactorily, I'd never have started it. <br /> &quot;The Darkness of God&quot; is the lame ending to a Space Opera that had potential.  I don't recommend starting the series knowing this is how it ends.	1997-11-24

Bennett is a physicist specializing in chaos-theory working in animal behavior.  Together using an interdisciplinary approach, they try to define the chaotic nature of faddish behavior in mammalian populations by studying a herd of sheep.  All this against the background of a &quot;science&quot; factory, and the ultimately, hip population of Boulder, Colorado. <br /> Willis's prose is good, the story is light, breezy, and funny as she pokes fun at every target within range.  The author's treatment of the main character's friends and colleagues is particularly funny.  They are all technically sound and socially impossible.  I found the capsule summaries of various fads and discussion of the serendipitous nature of some important science discoveries interesting. <br /> This story is however without any depth and could have been written as a short story.  The end was apparent before half the novel was read.  In addition, it can only be called science fiction because the main characters are scientists and it is a work of fiction. <br /> &quot;Bellwether&quot; is humorous.  It reminds me of Po Bronson's The First $20M is the Hardest', although not quite as dark.  It's a quick read that will keep you smiling.	1997-11-24

Readers don't need to have read the other Carlucci novels, but are advised to do so.  The story is about the aging Detective Lieutenant Frank Carlucci in his going to hell, near future San Francisco.  In this story, a group of medico-terrorists operating out of San Francisco's anarchistic, free-zone, &quot;The Core&quot; is suspected of releasing an bio-engineered form of hemoragic fever.  Russo picks-up the long-term plot lines from his previous novels and extends them, but doesn't finish any of them. <br /> The first novel, &quot;Avenging Angel&quot; was OK, but could have been better.  The second, &quot;Carlucci's Edge&quot; was better.  Actually, it was pretty good.  &quot;Carlucci's Heart&quot; is better still.  Russo's writes a pretty fair cyber-punk, detective novel. His prose is good, and his tech is fair although uneven in points.  I like his characters, a lot. <br /> The Carlucci series is still basically, a 90's police novel with a cyberpunk veneer.  However, it is the best of the cyberpunk/detective genre.  This series still needs a more through consistency check.  The background use of computers, bio-technology, and aerospace technology in this near-future are not consistent with each other.  What bothered me the most about &quot;Heart&quot; was the ending.  In both of Russo's previous novels he rushed to the end, duct taping the story's loose-ends together to close in 300 pages.  &quot;Heart&quot; is no exception.  It has a strong start, a healthy middle, and an atrophied ending.  Even crutching on the reader's knowledge from previous novels doesn't help this novel in the end. <br /> &quot;Heart&quot; is the best Carlucci novel to date. While Russo's characterization and dialogue are improving, there is not a similar improvement in the author's ability to pace his way through the story.  This Carlucci novel, like everyone before it leaves me thinking &quot;That's  it?&quot; at the end.  I'm losing my patience with this author.	1997-11-21

It may have deep and hidden inner meaning, if you believe the &quot;log rolling&quot; by the authors on the jacket cover. <br /> The story chronicles an intersteller voyage in a generation ship by a multi-ethnic group of Quakers to Epsilon Eridani.  The point-of-view is from characters at the beginning of the voyage making the decision to escape Earth, near the end of the voyage facing the prospect of dramatic change in planetary life, and an early pioneer scorning the womb of the ship. <br /> Gloss's prose is solid and her tech is good.  Her choice of using Quakers as interstellor voyagers was inspirational.  In particular, the Japanese/Costa Rican/Norwegian Quaker society of the 5th voyaging genaration put an interesting spin on the story. <br /> However, Gloss lost me in the three, thinly threaded jumps in time and seven or eight characters.  Perhaps its because this is a women's novel that I just didn't get it.  The real story appears to be about female relationships and aging.  The the science fiction aspects of the story were there to provide a high contrast background only.  I'm not sure why the author had to write this story as science fiction.  It could have been a contemporary novel.  Finally, this is such a &quot;touchy feely&quot; novel, the tech got short shrift.  I wondered, if a generational ship could survive the voyage using the &quot;Green&quot; life-style described in the story. <br /> This novel is really slow and low on excitement.  The author sets out with a good science fiction premise then elides it to describe a village society.  Read it to fall asleep.	1997-11-17

It tells the story of a dysfunctional SF bond trading office.  The office is a corporate meatgrinder churning out profits, making those crazy or tough enough to handle the stress rich, and crushing the rest.   In the pressure cooker of the bond market, &quot;when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro&quot;.  If you're not a pro, you're fired.  One day, a new salesman Eggs Igino fresh out of grad school arrives.  He's like Jesus, and he changes everything. <br /> This book was so good, I read it in two days.  At one point I had to put it down because I was laughing so hard tears were running down my cheeks.  Bronson's prose is this weird melange of Joseph Heller and Hunter S. Thompson (in his early years).  It's the ridiculous, mixed with base human emotions, and salted with the bizarre. <br /> While hilarious, Bronson's plot is a bit weak.  He appears to be an author who derives more from the setting then the story.  I had trouble sorting out the main character's (Igino) motives.  Or maybe the main character was Sid Geeder?  I couldn't be sure.  In addition, his two female character's (Lisa Lisa and Sue Marino) were interchangeable. <br /> &quot;Bombardiers&quot; is a good read.  It's got information, sex, absurdity, and cruel humor administered at an amphetamine charged pace.  You won't put it down.	1997-11-13

Its highly readable by someone with only the fundamentals of parasitology and epidemiology interested in modern day epidemics. <br /> Wills takes the reader through a survey of the world's primary epidemic diseases explaining their origin, morphology, the history of their study and cure.  In addition, he addresses some Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) such as syphilis and AIDS.  A major thesis is the constant war of adoption taking place genetically between parasites, disease organisms and human beings.  At a macro-level, humanity is changing its environment in the name of progress and to eliminate and control diseases.  At the micro-level, parasites and diseases are rapidly mutating themselves to find new hosts in this new environment.  On occasion, the resulting mutation is lethal to the host and becomes an epidemic (the modern term for plague). <br /> Wills style is highly readable including several personal stories to illustrate his points.  Reading this book does require at least undergraduate knowledge of biology and genetics.  However, the author clearly explains the more complex aspects of the subject.  The discussion on cholera is particularly interesting and well done. <br /> Wills book does suffer from a lack of coordination and the discussion is uneven.  The major sections address the individual diseases and parasites well.  However, they are not well organized together as a whole.  I imagine there is a connection in the discussion between viral, bacterial, and multicellular parasite contagion, but I failed to fully see the progression.  For example, while titillating, I failed to see the connection between syphilis and malaria.  Some subject diseases are better covered then others.  Also, some diseases are approached in a different fashion from others.  This made it difficult to compare and contrast all the diseases discussed in the book.  For example, the discussion of cholera is heavily weighted toward morphology and includes personal anecdotes.  Willis's discussion of syphilis,. is primarily on the historical origin of the disease.  What about a personal anecdote? <br /> Yellow Fever, Black Goddess is a good introduction to modern epidemics for the college-level reader.  It discusses several organisms found in the world today that can quickly flourish into epidemics or are epidemic.  However, the broad theme of the book is not as well handled as the individual plagues.	1997-11-11

Along the way this bright, naive, young idealist is manipulated into starting a company.  The story ambles along through the &quot;Andy in Wonderland&quot; atmosphere of the Silicon Valley startup. <br /> Bronson's prose is hip and cynical.  Some of his vignette's are precious. <br /> However, the story was a bit thin.  The plot reminded me more of a juvenile novel than the polished work of an accomplished author.  Sections of the novel are quite good, but the matrix is too weak to hold it all together.  The story falls apart into a collection of amusing anecdotes.   <br /> I started &quot;The 1st $20M is the Hardest&quot; based on an excerpt published in &quot;Wired&quot;.  It should have stayed a short story or a novella.  Bronson's wry humor helped me to finish this book, but there is not enough substance to recommend it.	1997-11-10

At heart it is a love story between a (human) woman and an android mulched in with your typical government conspiracy thriller. <br /> In the not-to-distant future, Kay Bee Suliman is a women who posed as a man to cover a Mid-East war as a correspondent.  Her boss under considerable pressure from an evil agency of the U.S. government pressures her into returning to the Mid-East to provide a cover for inserting an android (Halston) secret agent into the region.  She accepts the assignment (again posing as a man), and finds out that nothing is what she thinks it is.  The plot is like &quot;Blade Runner&quot; meets &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; with cross-dressing. <br /> Woods prose is good.  Her smart-talking Kay Bee Suliman has quite a few pips during the course of the story.  Her descriptive passages also have a wry humor worth reading. <br /> The science fiction in this story was unremarkable and incidental.  Except for Halston, this could have been any clichéd reporter-does-spy-thing-for-double-crossing-government-agency story.  The tech was pretty thin and unoriginal.  In addition, I found the use of &quot;a fictional Middle-Eastern country&quot; bogus.  The author went to a lot of work to get the culture correct.  Throwing in the real names or extrapolating a possible future would not have been a far reach. <br /> &quot;Looking for the Mahdi&quot; is unremarkable.  You've seen this story before, although probably without the gender-bending and the new millennium CNN-like spin.  Frankly, in parts it was boring in its predictability.  I only stuck with it for the prose.  Read it for the main character's quips and 3rd world travelogue.	1997-11-03

I didn't finish it. <br /> In the story Anderson recycles the classic, hero Anson Guthrie from &quot;Harvest of Stars&quot;.  &quot;Harvest&quot; was not a bad novel.  And I could believe its vision of the future.  In &quot;Fleet&quot;, hundreds of years have passed.  On Earth, an interplanetary sentient computer network exists along side of nano-tech, planetary engineering, and near FTL travel.  When two of the characters are given a calculator and told to memorize all the sines from zero to 45 degrees to four decimal places as punishment, I stopped reading.  Calculators!  Here is an author unclear with the concept.  Thinking like that would result in flint chippers being issued as standard equipment with nuclear warheads.  That is the problem with &quot;Fleet&quot; everyone thinks and acts like they're in 60's or 70's USA.  <br /> Anderson remains technically a good writer, but he is severely dated.  Claims to be a &quot;Hard Science Fiction Author&quot; mean he does not write novels with scenes violating the laws of physics.  However, societal and technologic change are considerably more volatile then the speed of light.  This is a novel by an author who is literally &quot;locked-in&quot; to his formative years.  &quot;Fleet&quot; is golden age of sf draped in 90's techie buzzwords.  The result is a story not silly enough to be considered a parody.	1997-10-01

A large portion of the population is addicted to a full sensory entertainment called &quot;Yox&quot; and is on social welfare.   A large segment of the productive population are &quot;therapied&quot;.  The therapied are citizens who have been treated with nanites to correct sociopathic behavior, mental or physical ailments.  The stresses of this perfect world take a heavy toll on the population.  Gradually, then very quickly  &quot;therapied&quot; citizens are either lapsing or developing strange new mental disturbances.  The lives of four people and an AI wend there way toward the solution of this mysterious breakdown. <br /> This story recycles some of Bear's &quot;Queen of Angles&quot; characters.  You don't have to have read &quot;Queen&quot; to enjoy &quot;Slant&quot;.  Bear's prose is solid.  He's a past master of a storyteller.  Any futurist would enjoy this not-quiet-cyberpunk story.  I especially liked his cullings from the net at the beginning of most chapters. <br /> What I did not like about the story was the way Bear sliced and diced the point of view.  In the beginning there are fully five main characters (Jill, an AI; Gif an old cracker; Mary, a cop, Alice, a porn queen; and Jonathan, a businessman).  This was way too many.  These multiple points of view made the plot difficult to follow.  The development of the better characters suffered by that of the lessor.  The story could have been more concise or even richer, if the reader wasn't being violently reset every six or eight pages. <br /> Bear creates a believable, although not very nice future.  I would read this book just for the author's vision of a world whose greatest struggle is better entertainment.  On the downside, I did find the story hard to follow.  &quot;Slant&quot; is good, but not asgood as it should have been.	1997-09-27

With nothing better to do, they organize an expedition to recover the planes from a tropic paradise ruled by a brutish dictator and make themselves rich.  In the process, they prove that old age and cunning can prevail over youth and enthusiasm.  <br />  The best part of this story was the hardware.  Ing writes about aviation.  The flying scenes were the best.  The firearms, heavy equipment, were not too shabby either.  The informational aspects of the story make this is &quot;guys&quot; novel.  <br />  There was nothing new in the plot of this novel.  I knew how this story was going to end a quarter of the way into it.  All the side-plots and character development could not disguise the predictable ending.  The author should have spent as much time camouflaging his clichés as he did his mint-condition, Japanese Zeros.  <br />  &quot;Flying to Pieces&quot; should have been titled &quot;The Over-the-Hill Gang Flies Airplanes&quot;.

This leads him to a serial murderer and a plot involving a Clipper-like national encryption standard.  <br />  The best part of the story was the dialogue.  It was hip, and flip.  In addition, the author's had their tech straight.  Although, I think the scientist's daughter did end-up going on-line in a pizza parlor without a phone connection (or a cell modem) at least once.  I also doubt you can squeeze enough C4 inside a 3.5&quot; floppy to create a   weapon of mass destruction.   <br />  The problem I had was the story had been told before.  There was nothing new in the way it was told.  In addition, the characters did not have enough spin to escape cliché.  Except for characters getting sliced-and-diced, I'll have to agree with the Kirkus review, that this book would appeal more to Young Adults.  <br />  Read this book, if you want to catch-up on the (now defunct) Clipper national encryption issue without getting technical..	1997-09-17

Milo's long awaited inheritance is embezzled before he receives it, and the old war-horse sets out to find the banker who robbed him.  On the way he enlists Sughrue's help.  In the meantime Sughrue enlists Milo's help to find the Chicano assassins who left him gut-shot and for dead.  Coincidentally, they find the two events are linked.  <br />  This is classic Crumbley with his gritty scenes and pithy prose.  It would help for the reader to have read previous Crumbley novels like &quot;One to Count Cadence&quot; or &quot;The Last Good Kiss&quot; for background.  However, this is two tough, old men taking on a bunch of very bad characters relying on a wealth of experience, firepower, and their ability to absorb tremendous punishment.  Along the way they find time to get drunk, stoned, and laid--great stuff.  <br />  In places the story is a little weak.  Crumbley may know his way around a MOSSBERG 500 BULLPUP, but laptops and cryptography are blackboxes and blackmagic.  It seems like every gumshoe now needs a pet geek to move the plot along.  Finally, Milo and Sughrue have always been much the same character.  Putting the two of them together in the same story was a Sybil-like reading experience.  Both characters speak with the same voice.  <br />  If you are a Crumbley fan read it.  The only problem you will have is &quot;who do you like better, Milo or Sughrue&quot;?  Otherwise, the uninitiated may find this novel a bit confusing.	1997-09-04

Jennifer only loves herself.  Jennifer and Courtney are best friends. Courtney  is paralyzed by ennui.  She runs off to NYC seeking the &quot;big change&quot; which will propel her life forward.  The story ping-pongs back and forth between David and Courtney as they look for love in all the wrong places.  <br />  &quot;Bongwater&quot; is full of hip prose, interesting and amusing situations.  The dialogue is priceless.  However, the story isn't real.  Like the TV show &quot;Friends&quot;, nobody works, but everyone has money.  The characters are also wise beyond their years.  I found the most interesting characters were not the main ones.  One thing that really annoyed me was  the author's misuse of time and names.  Portland is this netherworld of neither night or day.  Eight hours sometimes passed in mid-sentence.  Since most of the action takes place in bars and coffee shops, I rarely certain what time of day it was.  Finally, nobody has a last name in &quot;Bongwater&quot;.  A character named Lisa, was spontaneously generated in mid-story.  I was certain I'd missed her introduction and description. I flipped back two chapters searching in vain to find out who she was before I caught on.  How many guys named Bob do you know?  <br />  &quot;Bongwater&quot; must have been a good short story once.  It is very amusing, but its not a very good novel.  If you like reading slacker-lit like this, try Rick Moody's &quot;Garden State: A Novel&quot;, first.

It is not really science fiction, but it is also not fantasy.  I think of it as science fantasy. <br /> The story is set in a world where the ancient Hellenic civilization never fell, and instead prospered to conquer the known world.  Alexander was usurped, Roman remained a city state and the West as we know it never developed.  This Hellenic empire expands until it is itself checked by an expanding ancient Chinese empire.  The story is about  Aias, a Greek scientist's efforts to develop a fusion bomb to use against the Chinese.  It includes the technical challenges, intrigues, and moral implications concerning the health, care and feeding of atomic weapons.  <br />  All this is pretty standard stuff.  Except, in addition to the historical twist the author redefines the laws of nature to operate according to ancient classical beliefs.  There is no periodic table of the elements, there is only fire, water, earth, and air.  The sun and planets revolve around the Earth.  This universe does not operate according to Einstein, and Copernicus.  <br />  I found the story in &quot;Celestial Matters&quot; to be rather underwhelming.  The author is competent. .  One theme did he handle well was the divine inspiration characters regularly received from the pantheon of gods.  However, he is  not good enough to handle his &quot;big idea&quot; of a universe operating according to Aristotelian science.  The scenery consistently upstaged the characters.  In addition, I could have used a full appendix on Classical cosmology, including maps.  How many planets did the ancient Greeks know of?  In what order from the Earth did they orbit?  What was the paper, scissors, rock relationship of the prime elements fire, water, earth and air?  What is the modern name of the ancient Chinese capitol?  Only very late in the story is a character introduced to explain some of these things.  <br />  &quot;Celestial Matters&quot; is an interestingbook, but a strictly mediocre novel.  In some ways, the book is like Robert Forward's novels.  I only found it worth reading for the intellectual exercise of understanding the background physics.	1997-08-16

Its about a near-future, have-not women who gets a lucky break and toughs it out to get a better life and almost love. <br /> The cover blurbs on the trade edition seriously over-hype this story.  The exhortation to &quot;READ IT OR BLEED IT!&quot; almost lost me.  Yes, there is sex, drugs, and violence.  And, it is actually well-handled.  The novel does not become the tawdry, parody of the genre you might expect from reading the cover.  The author's prose is good.  Her action scenes are particularly well done.  I also believe male characters come off rather well for this niche of the genre.  One problem I had was that in some places the author's attention to detail is very good, in others it falls (way) down.  In addition, the plot lines also required a &quot;suspension of belief&quot; in places.  There were just too many coincidences moving the story along.  <br />  &quot;The &quot;Nature of Smoke&quot; is OK.  It is not as good as the lesbian, cyberpunk written by Nicole Griffith or Pat Cadigan(which I highly recommend). Read it despite the cover.	1997-08-12

The story is set eight years after Saylor's &quot;Roman Blood&quot;. Gordianus the down-on-the-heels Roman detective is hired by Crassus, the richest man in Rome to investigate the murder of one of his factotums by slaves.  However, if Gordianus proves the innocence of the slaves he may unravel his employer's political ambitions. <br /> Hard-boiled detective mysteries are pretty formulaic-Gordianus is soft-boiled  Truth, justice and the Roman-way are more important to him then silver.  This novel is Grisham-esque mixing murder, money, and corporate politics Roman style.  Saylor continues to write well.  His description of the Roman funeral rites, and the drugged Sybil were particularly good.  His violence and action passages continue to be a bit weak.  In addition, homosexual relations receive more development then straight sex in this story.  I'm a little disappointed with the author's legerdemain to keep the murderer's identity secret until the end.  <br />  &quot;Arms of Nemesis&quot; is good.  However, it is not as good as Saylor's first novel &quot;Roman Blood&quot;.  Historical murder mystery readers will enjoy it for its accuracy and detail.	1997-08-08

It features Gordianus the Finder as the gumshoe.  Gordianus a down-on-the-heels Roman detective is hired by Cicero an up-and-coming republican, lawyer/politician to gather evidence proving the innocence of a murder suspect he's defending.  Gordianus's footwork unveils a not just the murder, but a political intrigue involving the highest levels of the dictator Sulla's regime. <br /> Whodunnits are pretty formulaic.  This one reminds me a lot of the best of Ellroy mixing murder, money, and politics.  The spin of setting it in ancient Rome makes it more interesting.  Saylor writes well.  His prose is tight, and graphic.  The obligatory gratuitous sex is especially well done.  His violence and action passages are just a little weak.  In addition, the story is twisty enough, not to figure it out ahead of time.  <br />  &quot;Roman Blood&quot; is good.  It is a well crafted, murder mystery with enough information on ancient Rome to keep even serious readers of historical fiction interested.	1997-08-08

In this Falco story, he hits the road going to the  empire in the East.  The story is good, with the  usual witty dialogue.  However it is not the best   of the series.   <br />   Note the title of this novel departs from the author's usual combination of Roman deity and metal.   <br />   The best Falco novels are set in Rome.  I think Falco sums it up in the   story when he says &quot;the Aventine is my territory&quot;.   This story lacks somewhat by the absence of Petronious Longus, Falco's extended family, and the Roman political machine.   <br />   Besides the title change, one thing I didn't like was how Helena Justina stole the story.  Falco comes off like a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; Ralph Cramden to   her Gladys. I like the way Helena complicates his life and acts as a foil.  However, Falco novels have traditionally been gum-shoe, detective classics.  I finished this novel wondering if I'd read a V.I. Warshowski spin-off.   <br />   &quot;Last Act in Palmyra&quot; is worth reading, however it is not the best in the series. Falco remains at his best beating the cobbles of Rome.	1997-07-30

This is Falco at his best.  <br />  The story does suffer a minor problem with an all-to-quick wrap-up.  <br />  Finally, I think Davis's long-term plot lines are getting &quot;long of tooth&quot;.  Its long past time for Falco to be elevated to equestrian rank, marry Helena Justina, take-over his father's business, and get into politics.  Falco is getting too domestic to play the gumshoe.  <br />  A joy to read for those who love Falco.	1997-07-30

A colony ship escaping from the previous intergalactic conflict lands on an alien world and breaks the familiar &quot;non-interference&quot; directive.  The alien's take the Terran's tech and permute the whole contact experience into a religion.  Generations later when they burst upon the galactic scene they start the next interstellar war in a misguided attempt to bring the &quot;true&quot; faith the Terrans.  <br />  This is rollicking good space opera.  The story includes the characters we've all seen before in Niven and Pournelle's &quot;Mote in God's Eye&quot;, national stereotypes: Zhukov-like Russian, Fletcher-like American, and Jellicoe-like Englishman.  The whole story is a mish-mash that looks like the WWII naval war in the Pacific with the &quot;Shell Head&quot; aliens being the Japanese and the Federation being the U.S..  Fun stuff.  <br />  What I didn't like was the author's disposable characters.  A cardboard character would be introduced for about on page just to die.  I wish some of them would have lasted a little longer.  A few were more interesting then the more persistent main characters.   <br />  &quot;Crusade&quot; is chronologically first (although written second)  in a series including &quot;Insurrection&quot; and &quot;In Death Ground&quot;.  &quot;Insurrection&quot; was written first and is not bad.  &quot;Crusade&quot; came next and is good.  However, the most recent &quot;In Death Ground&quot; is total drek.  Somewhere along the line (`92-'96) the authors forgot that characters and not hardware make-up novels.  Hopefully, the authors will get back on track and use &quot;Crusade&quot; as the example for the next in the series.	1997-07-13

In this case, the frontier worlds break away from the center of Terran power.  In the process they rend the fabric of the Federation Space Navy.  <br />  The characters are not real 3-D, but in space opera who cares?  There are a tad more of them then I believe the authors are technically able to handle.  I suspect the authors harbor a secret desire to write the sf version of &quot;The Winds of War&quot;.  <br />  Good stuff for those looking for a content-free shoot-em-up.	1997-07-13

A cast of women characters occupy the key roles in this story about a tramp freighter of the starways which inadvertantly gets involved in smuggling and AI rights. <br /> There are no new real ideas in this story.  The tech is a little dodgy, and the background culture is a bit thin.  For example, the idea of physically transporting data in a starship's hold when there are faster-than-light communications reminds me of &quot;coals to Newcastle&quot;.  In addition making the ship's captain a devoted, Islamic women strikes me as a bit far fetched.  <br />  I rate it an OK read, but nothing exceptional.	1997-07-10

It was unremarkable then - it is unremarkable now. <br /> The story is about a near-psychotic, superman (Felix) who becomes a killing-machine in powered, combat armor on a deathtrap planet during an interstellar war.  The enemy is (predictably) insectile and remorseless.  The brass is likewise implacable, and through a &quot;computer glitch&quot; keeps throwing Felix into the fray long after he should have been withdrawn.  <br />  &quot;Armor&quot; is to military sf, what a streetfight is to (pre-Tyson/Holyfield) professional boxing.  The firefights hark back to &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and not Audie Murphy.  I imagine at some level the story is an allegory reflecting back to the Cold War like Robert Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.  However, &quot;Armor&quot; isn't as good as &quot;Troopers&quot; (not that &quot;Trooper's&quot; was a literary masterwork).  The story is very predictable and there are only five characters in it's 500+ pages (with the same tough-guy character appearing twice).  <br />  Perhaps, the serious sf audience has become more sophisticated since &quot;Armor&quot;  was first published.   With all the good sf out-of-print, why this book was re-issued I don't know.  Perhaps it is to cash-in on the hype associated with the upcoming &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; movie.  I suggest reading two good sf novels (&quot;Kaleidoscope Century&quot; by Barnes and &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot; by Swanwick) in the space of this bloated mediocre one.	1997-07-10

And the borders are tight.  Suddenly, the borders get a lot tighter and the smuggler underground starts to collapse.  The pilot starts a quest to find the king of smugglers to stop the end of his way of life. <br /> Foy is good.  His narrative is good.  His tech is good and so are his characters.  However, he can't end a story.  &quot;Contraband&quot; grinds to halt the way &quot;The Shift&quot; fizzled in the end.  I suspect Foy is a novella-length story author with novel-length book contracts.  Read it for the scenery.	1997-07-09

Two young men join a religious cult to eat regular and get a roof over their heads during a `00-somthing great depression.  Oddly, the story is told in the first person, and you never find out the narrator's real name.  While they are scamming the cult they come in contact with mystical aliens who roam Earth at will.  Most of the narrative involves the other man Nastor or Theshei (his cult name) who has near superhuman capabilities.  He should be wearing a cape and a mask. <br /> The two guys joining a cult to get out of the rain and the narrator's real conversion being played off against the rogue Threshei was interesting.  Theshei's  rush to contact the aliens wrapped the story around an axle of metaphysics and aliens.  The ending reminded me of a Trek episode.	1997-07-09

However, I don't believe it represents any new scholarship on the subject. <br /> Howarth's prose is clear and concise.  The book adopts a strict chronological order.    <br />  Unfortunatly, the book lacks proper maps to support the narrative.  Place names and scaled maps for the medieval Levant and Europe are sorely needed.  The strategy of the Order's Holy Land garrissons is impossible to understand without them.  In addition, in many sections the Order are mere &quot;spear carriers&quot; to more famous historical figures (Richard the Lion Hearted and Philip I of France to name two).    <br />  The book is a good introduction to the Order. It is very readable.  However, a more quantitative analysis of the Order's finances, logistics, population, and strategy for defense of the Holy Land would have been appreciated.	1997-06-26

Powerful xenophobic, Bug Eyed Monsters (BEMs), challenge the Terran Federation Navy for the warp points to the heart of each other's territory.  The story is one over-long, tale of space dreadnought hardware-envy.  Interchangeable male and female space navy &quot;officers and gentleman&quot; allied with bird, cat, and lizard-like over-anthropomorphized allied aliens fight baby eating BEMs. <br /> I started &quot;In Death Ground&quot; on the basis of Weber and White's  &quot;Insurrection&quot;.  &quot;Insurrection&quot; is good space opera.  &quot;In Death Ground&quot; is junk.  There is no story in the 630-odd pages of the book.  It is paper-thin characters, and innumerable WWII-inspired, space battles and marine landing actions. The authors re-wrote Samuel Eliot Morison's &quot;The Two-Ocean War&quot; as a space-opera.  The result is a perfect example of when author's become more enamored with their background technology and loose sight writing a novel.  <br />  Another annoying aspect of this book is it does not end.  There is no warning in the cover blurbs that after 630 pages the war is not won, and the aliens vanquished.  After  all those &quot;missile duels in the interstellar void&quot; you  still need to plonk down another $7 to find out who wins.  <br />  The genre of space opera is a cliché, and it can be entertaining in the hands of creative authors. However, it should never be as boring as this.	1997-06-16

However, the story lacked &quot;closure&quot;.  <br /> In the story a young heiress is kidnapped and escapes into a cyberpunk netherworld.  Here she hides-out looking to find herself.  <br />  The tech is good, the prose is good, and the setting was noir and gritty.  However, the story is a bit thin when it comes to Lore's family which features so prominently in the beginning and end. Lore's mother, and sisters are cyphers that come to figure too largely in the story.  <br />  Finally, where did all the men and straight-het sex go?  The novel seemed to exist in a society of women.  The absence of male characters (except as evil doers) was a bit too obvious.  This detracted from the reality of the story.  <br />  By the way, I think the &quot;River&quot; is the Humber.	1997-06-09

Torture is legal form of evidence gathering.  A twist is that only military, medical doctors are licensed as inquisitors.   <br />   The story revolves around a brilliant, young doctor consigned to the medical corps by his aristocratic-familial duty, finds he has a Torquemada streak.   <br />   In the story, except for the main character none of the other characters resolve themselves.  The background society also remains unresolved, despite constant references to political movements and ethnic divisions.  The gothic atmosphere of torture, substance abuse, political intrigue, veiled and unveiled homosexuality got boring in their detail.   <br />   What really annoyed me, is the story did not end. The book is the first part of a who-knows-how-many installment series.  The jacket liner blurbs do not state this.

It discusses the evolution of the IC chip from its roots in tube-based electronics to the future.  In the process it provides a survey of the people (primarily American) and companies that developed the technology.<br /> The book was informative in cursory way, but was uneven in presentation.  Some chapters are flat and report-like, others are blue-sky.  Some chapters pre-suppose a technical background and others do not. It appears the book was originally written in Japanese.  I believe it probably started as a graduate or PhD thesis and was &quot;dumbed-down&quot; and hyped-up for publication. <br />  &quot;Living with the Chip&quot; provides a good start for someone looking for information on the microelectronics industry, but is not a source.	1997-06-02

The novel takes a little bit of history, a little bit of hypochondria, a dash of rascism, the ever popular vampire and stews them together.<BR><BR> Conner hypothesizes the release of a pneumatic ebola virus by the German High Command at the end of WWI.  The ensuing epidemic follows the course of the Great Flu Epidemic which acutally followed the war.  The Flu killed millions.  However, this bio-war Hemoragic Fever kills hundreds of millions.  If effects all strata of society, except for those of African descent.  As successive waves of the plague roll across the world like the black plague did in the middle ages, society warps and in places crumbles as the existing white dominated civilization becomes extinct.  <BR><BR>  Set against this background in a dying American heartland city is a Vampire-like murderer being pursued by a white newspaper reporter working for a dying newspaper and a black detective.  <BR><BR>  I liked Archangel.  The characters were a little cliche'd. However, Conners science and history were excellent. The background was so rich, and credible &quot;the characters I've seen so many times before&quot; eased me through the novel.  The author even surprised me with the obligatory twist at the end.  <BR><BR>  What didn't I like?  Conner needs a better editor.  There were several errors in his grammer, and I don't mean the quoted Ebonics passages.  In addition, for a first novel, he was too ambitious. He created too many characters with too many changes in points of view.  <BR><BR>  In the middle of a spate of alternate history thrillers set in 1900's this is a good one.  Recommended.	1997-03-25

The events are presented in a chronological order, cutting back and forth between the actions and maneuvers of the Great (Britain, France, and Germany) and Minor Powers (primarily Belgium) in different parts of the continent.  One very import item making this book so informative is the use of maps.  Parkenham has included enough maps to place all the actions.  Frequently, histories need a period atlas in hand for reference.  This one doesn't.<BR><BR> &quot;Scramble&quot; is about politicians, soldiers, merchants, missionaries, and explorers.  Readers interested in the personalities (King Leopold of Begium, Gladstone, Livingston, Ali Pasha, etc.) who shaped the events in the European conquest of Africa and the early Imperialist era will get the most from the book.  I personally found King Leopold to be like a spider in the web as he plotted to found the Belgian Congo.  In general, Britains and Anglo-Saxons come out rather well in this history and Europeans and Middle Easterners less well.<BR><BR>  If I can find fault in &quot;Scramble&quot; its because it is too Anglo-centric.  The British historical contribution to the period and events is very detailed.  The French less so.  The Portogeuse, Spanish, and Italian is almost absent or incidental.  For example, British Imperial expeditions are described right down to the participating units (Guards Grenadiers, etc.); while French expeditionary missions described confuse Colonial Marines with Legion units.<BR><BR>  Even though this is a military and diplomatic history, the economic aspect of the story is missing.  The search for gold I can understand.  Buried in the narrative is the importance of the African export of Palm Oil.  However, I don't understand the price of or use of the ivory they (Europeans and native Africans) were slaughtering elephants for and hauling out ofAfrica.<BR><BR>  Parkenham's narrative is excellent and highly readable.  This book is recommend more as a peek into the personalities of the movers and shakers of Victorian times then as a history of African development.	1997-03-21

The obligatory steamy sex scenes are OK. Although the kink is more British, then Californian.  His research on computers, and architecture is OK. Although his use of technology is a bit pedantic. His tech is designed to not be wildly implausible to someone without a clue.  There are a few amusing glitches: like describing a Mercury Couger as a two seater (the rear seats are only so uncomfortable that they should be removed), and listing terabyte quanities of mass storage as &quot;10**12&quot; (reader's should be impressed by the incantation of scientific notation).    <BR><BR>  This story is a mindless read best saved for the beach when you have to keep half your mind on the kids, beer, and beach babes.	1997-02-16

While she is researching a historical story on a computer virus that infected humans with cybernetic implants she comes into contact with an information terrorist.

I particularly liked the heroine's concern about sterilizing a public usage jack to connect to the net in a train station. What really impressed me was the idea of a verbal computer programming language to make up for the lack of precision in natural language.  I loved it, glottal click and all.  <BR><BR>  What left me cold was the whale.  The cover jacket provides a mild whale spoiler.  Some cliche's I can handle, but not whales.  The book also smacked of what I call &quot;Sam E. Delaney-ism&quot;.  That is, a book beyond the depth of its audience.  It may be it was just to deep for me.  It may be it was just plain confusing.  <BR><BR>  I'm ambivilent about this novel.  Read it for the tech and and the story, but skim over the parts bemoaning the fallen state of mankind.	1997-01-26

I believe Mr. Brin intends to drag this story out for 10 years to help pay his mortgage like Mr. Benford did.  This story has been dragging on for so many years (real and story), words, and characters I can't follow it any longer.  A large amount of this book is spent refreshing the reader on what has happened.  When science fiction reaches the level of &quot;War and Peace&quot; in complexity, it is too much work to read.

US	53024479	R2CKYOVM0P8NDI	0312858752	334612263	Night Sky Mine	Books	3	3	3	N	N	OK, Mystery sf	&quot;Night Sky Mine&quot; is an OK sf, mystery novel, but not Melissa Scott's best work.  The story is written from the perspective of a girl-child (Ista Kelly), and a gay, couple of auxiliary, policemen.  In the mystery, they converge on solving the disappearence of ore-mining ships in a neighboring asteroid belt. <BR><BR>  Scott is a master (mistress?) of creating societies on the edge. &quot;Trouble, and Her Friends&quot; is a good example of edgy, sf wound-up in a cyberpunk future.  The scenery and the culture layed-out in &quot;Night Sky Mine&quot; were similarly excellent.  <BR><BR>   However, in &quot;Night Sky Mine&quot; the author tries to mix the cyberpunk with the space opera.  Like oil and water, they didn't mix well.  In particular, the changes in point of view were not well handled.  I found them confusing rather then compelling.  I could never distinguish between either of the two gay cops.  In addition, I found the tech to be just a little corney.  <BR><BR>  &quot;Night Sky Mine&quot; is OK sf, but pass if up if there is something else on the shelf.	1997-01-20
US	53024479	R21MNEBA0BMJ8E	0671877437	291308281	Memory	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Classic Vorkosigan!	This is a classic Miles Vorkosigan novel.  Miles at 30 has to<br />finally resolve the dual personalities of Lord Miles Vorkosigan<br />and Admiral Miles Naismith and choose between the two.  Its a novel<br /> about relationships, and probably only one a woman could write.<br /><br /> I like the Vorkosigan Saga.  Its not the best science fiction, and<br /> its not as &quot;edgy&quot; as I'd like, but Bujold has good characters.<br /> I liked &quot;Memories&quot;.  The quite moments of the novel are probably<br /> the best as the now familiar Miles explores himself and his<br /> relationships.  Miles relationships have always been the best part<br /> of the novels and stories.<br /><br /> What did'nt I like about &quot;Memories&quot;?  The cover.  What that cover has<br /> to do with the story I can't tell you.  The other thing is the minor<br /> awkwardness the author has in weaving together 30 years of Miles stories<br /> and Vor lore. The stories have not always been written in chronological order.<br /> There was almost too much reference to prior history. Then<br /> there might have been too much that was too new.<br /><br /> Recommended.	1996-12-20

Bruce Sterling's (&quot;Aristoi&quot;, &quot;Islands in the Net&quot;, &quot;Mirrorshades&quot; editor) new novel &quot;Holy Fire&quot; is very good. <BR><BR>  The novel postulates a gerontocracy developing through the perfection of geriatric medicine.  As old people live longer, they hold onto the positions of responsibility and power longer.  Since old people are inherently conservative, innovation and societal evolution slows down.  Resources are funneled into geriatrics medical technology.  In addition, the young (under 60 years old) become an underclass. <BR><BR>    The story is about an old women who becomes young.  The fountain of youth responsible for this is a revolutionary, rejuvenating medical procedure.  The conflict is between her new, &quot;vivid&quot; (novel slang for hip), hormonally driven, post-op self (Maya) and the asexual, &quot;posthuman&quot;, pre-op, personae's (Mia's) memories and habits.  Call her Gen-X with grandma lurking in the back of her mind.<BR><BR>    The book was good, right down to the nuances of potential 2070 tech.  Maybe he should have cranked back and set the novel a little closer to the present.  About the only problem I have is &quot;how well can a male author write a female main character?&quot;.  It could be argued that a posthuman female is asexual, but Stirling's 20-something Maya had the fingerprints of a 40-something male on her.<BR><BR>    Recommended.	1996-12-03

It introduces itself as survey of armored warfare from Cambrai to Desert Storm.  However, it contains no new scholarship and  seriously misses the mark in describing the evolution of tank  warfare over the past 85 years.  <BR>  Even the battles choosen as examples are poorly integrated.  The  general level of description is operational, however in places it  it is antidotal without trying to provide a tactical description.  of events.  Key changes in the warfighting model are ignored.  For example, a resonable explaination of the shift in the balance of  power between armor and infantry is given in the section on the Arab-  Israeli wars.  Yet, the development and effect of tank-busting aircraft  is absent unless you tabulate tank losses to aircraft begining in the  WWII campaigns in the western desert yourself. Even the connection  between the battles was very loose (other then chronologically).  <BR>  Finally, there are numerous typographical errors in the volume.  <BR>  About the only positive thing I can say about the book is the bibliography  is correct.  Although, it looked very similar to the recommended reading  list published by the West Point History department.  <BR>  &quot;Clash of Chariots&quot; is a shoddy piece of scholarship and writing.  My guess  is the author's could never decide on who their audience really was.	1996-11-26
US	53024479	R1IL1LTE1UK3D	0380786753	805742654	Fairyland	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Uneven story with far ranging ideas.	McAuley is becoming one of my favorite authors.  His &quot;Red Dust&quot; is probably the best thing he's written.  &quot;Fairyland&quot; is good, but not great. It contains his strong style of prose and attention to detail, but the perspective shift  after part-one is ineptly handled.  Part-one introduces a complex main character,  and an interesting environment.  Part-two, introduces a host of disposable characters  and 100 pages that add nothing to the story.  It took an act of will to stay with the  book.  Fortunatly, we get the main character back (albeit about 10 story years later).  A simpler architecture would have been more effective, and told the story  more concisely.	1996-11-01

Ian McDonald writes dense, meaty novels.  &quot;Evolution's Shore&quot; is one of these.  Frankly, I put it down twice before I started reading it in ernest.  Then, I couldn't put it down.<BR>  <BR>  The story is about a woman journalist and how she warps the  world around her pursuing her own definition of truth. The  background of the novel is an alien &quot;terraforming&quot; of Earth.  Humanity is hapless as an alien ecology sprouts across the  equator.  The ecology is seductive, its an alien Eden.  This is not a new theme to science fiction, I believe  David Gerrold's &quot;Chorr&quot;-series is the most popular of that genre.  However, the Chorr books are adolescent shoot-em-ups. &quot;Evolution's  Shore&quot; is a novel.<BR>  <BR>  The novel is rich and real.  The characters are good, although the  female main character has the defects of having been written by a  man.  The science is also very credible.  Finally, most of the story  takes place in Kenya.  The description of near-future Africa was worthy  of the best futurists.<BR>  <BR>  I would have rated this novel a 9 (there are no 10s), except for the ending.  McDonald did not end the story soon enough.  It appears that he wanted to  write two novels, and settled for one and a quarter.  The last quarter left more  questions then answers.	1996-09-08

The &quot;Ganymede Club&quot; is a sf mystery set in the same universe as &quot;Cold as Ice&quot;.  However that novel was unremarkable, &quot;Club&quot; is much better.  It ports the best aspects of that universe and its  most endearing character (Bat).  The novel is not original enought  to be great.  The plot is the tried and true: &quot;Psychiatrist learns  of plot while treating patient, and now must die.&quot; And there is the  surly, omnipotent Hacker--Bat to provide all the answers and save  the day.  Sheffield is from the &quot;hard&quot; school of sf, so &quot;Club&quot; is  not space opera.  He's also not a gritty writer--man has not fallen  to far in his fiction.  Hence &quot;Club&quot; comes across as a slightly  risque Nancy Drew (since the main character is a woman)in Jovian  orbit.  However, it is entertaining despite its predictability.	1996-08-28

It rivals McHugh's &quot;China Mountain Zhang&quot;. The story is about a man who periodically, and violently rejuvinates  himself through the 21st century.  The rejuvination wipes his concious  memory of life prior to the event.  Each time he rejuvinates, a new  identity is setup to protect him.  His personality is also subtly different  from lift-to-life. He's not real good at keeping records, and historical  data shows that his personal memoirs are &quot;revisionist&quot;.  Think of this as a  Cyberpunk, Lazarus Long novel.  Barnes is good, and getting better.  This is  his best to date.  One complaint.  The &quot;timetravel twist&quot; was not needed  in this story.  It needlessly complicated a twisty-enough yarn.	1996-08-26

The story is a rushed to completion Gen-X: boy meets female Vampire, Vampire falls in love with boy,  Vampire loses boy, and gives herself a fatal sunburn.  Lets call it  a nilhilist's Romeo and Juliet.    The book does have a couple of good lines.  The author would make  Coupland proud.  However, what might have been a good satire was  is washed away in gratuitous sex and violence.  The jacket calls it  erotic, I call it tawdry.	1996-08-26

It reminded me of the &quot;Young Adult&quot; novels I read as a teenager.  However the sex and violence would have disqualified it for this category.  The story did include the advertised hard science fiction. There was no warp drive, BEMs or contradiction of the laws of physics.  However, there are some real leaps of faith about the relationship of business to society.  Most disturbing was the right-wing diatribe embroidered into the story line.  The message is: Social welfare undermines personal initiative.  Although the reader is warned the story is a satire on the Education process, there is no humor involved	1996-08-21
