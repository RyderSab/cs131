It approaches the subject with scholarly exuberance. It covers many fine points that are often missing from texts on persuasive legal writing: ethical persuasion, rhetoric, polish. But to the extent that it is scholarly and is a text for an advanced legal writing class in law school, it will probably seem a little too much for the practicing lawyer. Only the most dedicated appellate specialist will find it useful, I predict.	2003-11-18

This book is an exhaustively researched, scholarly treatment of legal language from its earliest days until the 1970s. The text is almost intimidating in its scope, but Mellinkoff's wit and piercing insights into legalese make it a joy to read.<br />Any lawyer who reads it will have many &quot;aha&quot; moments (&quot;So THAT'S why we write that way&quot;). Plus, you're bound to improve your writing (&quot;I guess I can stop using that archaic word, now&quot;).<br />Also, this book should be required reading for everyone who teaches legal writing.	2003-08-29

I would recommend it for an introductory course on legal drafting. It covers the basics in a brief and readable way, and includes chapters on process, language, ambiguities, definitions, contract interpretation, and computer-assisted drafting.<br />Other texts provide more coverage and greater depth, but this book has the virtue of being short.

The text takes you through the revision process for three documents: a consumer-loan contract, an apartment-sales contract, and an insurance policy. Along the way, the book covers all aspects of plain-English drafting, including audience analysis, writing style, document design, substantive requirements, and testing.<br />The authors also thoroughly discuss methods for implementing plain-English writing in the law; they present the pros and cons of legislating plain English, as well as their own views on subjective versus objective testing of texts. In expressing their views and presenting their advice, the authors rely on authoritative studies, empirical research, and case law. <br />The book is surprisingly relevant even today. Apparently, not enough has changed since 1981.	2003-04-07

This book covers the fundamentals of legal writing so thoroughly and carefully that it could well substitute for many first-year legal-writing texts. Its approach may strike experienced writers as too traditional or too basic. Still, for the novice it will provide a solid grounding in legal-writing style, legal analysis, legal memos, letter writing, and persuasive writing. Many practicing lawyers would do well to heed the teachings in this book.<br />One critique: Persuasion is so common in law schools' first-year, legal-writing courses that this Nutshell probably had to cover it. But it covers it cursorily and might well have left it out. Persuasive writing is a topic that can (and does) fill entire books.	2003-03-20

It may be focused on SEC disclosure documents, but no lawyer could go wrong adopting the suggestions here. It covers document design, type, paragraphs, sentences, words, and legal-drafting conventions.

This book focuses heavily on the writing process; it discusses pre-writing, free writing, revising, and editing at great length. But it does not discuss them in a brief or interesting way. I found the text sometimes repetitive, sometimes wordy, and frequently dry.<br />Plus, the non-process writing advice is either highly abstract or narrowly focused on a hypothetical scenario used throughout the book. So the advice is less than helpful in many respects. And though the text contains some gems, they are usually buried in long, dense paragraphs or blurred by a stiff and formal tone.	2002-11-08

This book was published in 1982, but I liked it, and I think most lawyers could learn a great deal from it. It covers details, like the ten most common punctuation errors in legal writing, as well as more general topics like audience, organization, and style. And it does all of that in a readable and persuasive text.<br />The authors' main point is that lawyers ought to write like human beings, not like mindless robots, and the book gives dozens of examples--both good and bad. The book was inspiring and a pleasure to read.	2002-11-04

That said, it has some odd things about it.<br />I like: its support of clear and direct legal drafting, and its advice to abandon the archaic, formalistic garbage that clogs so much legal drafting.<br />I like: the section on document design and format, which is contemporary and sensible; the author explains in detail why a lot of legal-document formatting still looks so stodgy: the lingering effects of the typewriter.<br />I like: the practical advice from an experienced drafter on a variety of drafting subjects: headings, numbering, boilerplate, definitions, counterpart documents, and schedules/exhibits.<br />But there were some unexpected and odd sections, too: (1) a fairly long discussion of using footnotes for citations; this seems out of place in a book about transactional drafting; (2) a short chapter on explaining with examples, which contains an odd section on how to pick the fictional names for the example characters you are using; and (3) eight pages on guaranties--not on how to draft them, but on the substantive law of guaranty and suretyship; it again seemed out of place in a book about writing.<br />But the book is modern and has a lot of practical advice.

The sentence-level writing advice in this book is sound, but there could be more of it. The formatting advice is adequate, though I'd like to see more on how to write a true, up-front summary. And the &quot;fundamental guidelines&quot; chapter offers practical and useful information about the world of appellate judging for novice judges and law clerks.<br />That gets you to page 64. Pages 65 to 150 (the rest of the book, excluding appendices and index) is devoted to citation. This section duplicates the Bluebook and the ALWD Citation Manual--unnecessarily--and changes a lot of basic citation rules. Plus, there are 45 pages of suggested abbreviations. Are abbreviations a big problem in judicial writing? Given the coverage in this book, you might think so, but the book would have been better without a citation guide and with more organizational and style advice.	2002-09-04

After his tremendous scholarly work &quot;The Language of the Law,&quot; Mellinkoff wrote this gem. I really like it, and I wish I had read it 10 years ago. It's a book-length brief in favor of plain-English legal writing.<br />He takes strong positions on legal words and phrases that should be cut from legal writing, but he knows his stuff and backs up his assertions.

The book includes some basic and general good-writing advice, but it is not a strong text. Too many weaknesses.<br />First, there are too many long, block quotations from judicial opinions, and too little accompanying analysis of what was good or bad--specifically--in the quoted text.<br />Second, the subject of judicial humor doesn't justify 14 pages of treatment. Perhaps one page to amplify on this statement: &quot;Use it rarely, if ever, and then only toward yourself.&quot; The examples in that chapter are odd--almost none are humorous, nor does it seem that they were intended to be.<br />Third, the book uses the words &quot;decision,&quot; &quot;opinion,&quot; and &quot;judgment&quot; in less-than-careful ways, sometimes interchangeably and often confusingly. Not good in a book on judicial writing.	2002-08-19

A linguistic perspective on legal language is a valuable contribution to the study of language and the law. Mr. Solan, with degrees in linguistics and law, is the right author to tackle the subject. And the book has its strong aspects, such as when Solan discusses the details of real cases and shows how judges interpreted language inconsistently, or badly, or in the only way they could. Plus, his insights into the nonlinguistic forces that act on judges are useful.<br />But the book could have used a strong edit. There are too many convoluted sentences; I found myself re-reading for comprehension too often. I found a bit too much abstraction, too. And the constant foreshadowing in the early chapters (&quot;as I'll discuss in chapter 5 . . .&quot;) became very annoying.<br />If the essence of great nonfiction is making complex material understandable, then this book is average.	2002-08-15

I'm a teacher of legal writing, and I want all my students to read this book--and every lawyer, too. It offers insights into legal language that I have not seen anywhere else: how lawyers use language to set themselves apart; how statutes employ archaisms to present an air of authority; how jury instructions confuse jurors.<br />It also presents the many reasons that legal language came to be the way it is, while avoiding simplistic explanations. And though it discusses many ways that legal language fails us, it gives just as many ways to improve it.<br />Most important, the book takes legal language seriously, calling it a &quot;sublanguage&quot; of English and &quot;a set of linguistic features that are superimposed on everyday speech.&quot; At the same time, it recognizes that lawyers who care about communicating will have to make difficult decisions about what parts of legal language  to keep and what parts to abandon.	2002-07-10

This 1996 edition of The Elements of Drafting is the ninth--the first was published in 1949. At that time it was certainly a leading text. It covers fundamentals of legal drafting, including organization, definitions, words of authority, expressions relating to time, and others. In 1949 it was probably one of the earliest texts to do so in a thoughtful way.<br />But the book contains many remnants of that era. It is written in a somewhat archaic and stilted style--by contemporary standards. The cases cited for support on many points are quite old. And the drafting examples are outdated. Most of the book's principles are still sound, but the presentation seems dated in 2002.<br />(The author is Australian and the book addresses mostly Australian law.)	2002-07-08

I've tutored students on test-taking for years, and this book covers 90% of what it takes to excel on law school exams--clarity of expression, issue spotting, analysis, and organization. But in my experience, those will get you a B or a B+ at best. What you need is that added something, that brilliant insight, that \\"extra\\" that gets the professor to say \\"Wow. This is an A exam.\\"<br />What is that? To me, it's understanding what the professor is looking for--knowing the professor's approach or angle or idiosyncratic preferences--then using that knowledge to reinforce those preferences or challenge them thoughtfully. You must make your answer not only legally right but intellectually satisfying to the professor.<br />How do you do that? Some people just have the knack. For the rest, spend time talking to the professor in and out of class. Read what the professor has written. Immerse yourself in the professor's world (as it relates to the course). Probably a book can't teach that, and this one doesn't try.	2002-06-04

It's not a textbook on transactional practice, though it offers some insights and a few war stories. What is it? It's a somewhat unconventional introduction to legal drafting in law practice: cursory at best and a bit odd and dated at worst.<br />It's odd. For example, there's the 11-stanza poem called &quot;The Writer's Rhyme,&quot; which the author offers as &quot;a lyrical remembrance of our journey.&quot; And the placement of commas and periods with quotation marks follows the British convention, though the author is an American lawyer and the book is published in the U.S.<br />It's dated. Plain language and contemporary drafting advice are not to be found. For example, the author offers, as a bad example, a dense paragraph of unbroken text consisting of a single, 132-word sentence. The &quot;improved&quot; version, recommended by the author, is a dense paragraph of unbroken text consisting of two sentences--one of 91 words and one of 52. Hardly much better.	2002-06-04

We fondly refer to it as \\"the MOUS.\\" It's a handy legal-style manual, with good advice on many subjects, including capitalization, commonly misused words, and punctuation. But there are two main drawbacks.<br />First, it is not comprehensive enough to be the only style manual a lawyer or law student uses. With 90 very small pages (the dimensions are 4.5 inches by 6) it can't possibly cover all the important legal style matters--and it doesn't. You (and the Texas Law Review, for that matter) should adopt a comprehensive legal style manual--and there are several to choose from.<br />Second, it's sometimes arbitrary. For example: \\"When organizing ideas expressed in separate sentences into a numerical sequence, use first, second, third, . . . last (or finally).\\" Why not first, second, third, fourth? Neither method is clearly better, yet the MOUS arbitrarily prefers to start with ordinals and end with non-numerical text.	2002-05-23

The best reason to get this book is that the author has great credentials. He has drafted at the state and city level for over 30 years. That kind of experience, when combined with a commitment to plain language, makes for a valuable and authoritative text. And the book is, indeed, clearly written and thorough. The only drawback is the format--it's somewhat clunky, archaic, and slightly unprofessional in appearance. But if you need guidance on drafting rules and legislation, this is an excellent book that focuses on those skills.	2002-05-02

Disclosure: I am on a committee that promotes the ALWD Citation Manual. But I volunteered for the committee because the ALWD Manual is so good. Students who learn citation from the ALWD Manual will be fine because most of the concerns expressed by critics of the ALWD Manual are based on myths.<br />Myth 1: Practicing lawyers know the Bluebook. Sorry, but most lawyers don't even own the current Bluebook. Most own the one they got in law school, whether that's the 13th, 14th, 15th, or 16th edition. We're now on the 17th edition. And even then, most lawyers cite according to what they vaguely recall from law school, or they get someone else to do the citations.<br />Myth 2: Judges require bluebook citation form. Wrong. Most courts DO NOT require Bluebook form. Instead, they require uniform and consistent citations. And most judges would not know Bluebook citations from ALWD Manual citations. The differences are so few and so minor.<br />Myth 3: Students who learn ALWD Manual form will be in trouble when they go to work on a journal and must use the Bluebook. I doubt it. They will know citation form better because they learned it from a readable, logical manual. What will happen is that they will become disgusted with the Bluebook once they see how poorly written it is.	2002-05-02

I teach at a law school, and my students tell me that they like this pocket dictionary. You can't lug the complete edition of Black's around campus; it's too big. But this little paperback is just right for pulling out of a backpack when the professor uses a term everyone &quot;should&quot; know. It's convenient. And accurate.	2002-05-02
US	50579094	RRPDCQY7MGZ7O	0837706866	557156004	The Lawyer's Book of Rules for Effective Legal Writing	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Very short. Very good.	This book has 44 superb writing tips, but only 26 pages. Is that a problem? No. There are more comprehensive legal-writing guides. There are broader treatments of legal-writing style. And there are surely longer books. But there are none as short and to-the-point as this one. It's clear and easy to read, but most lawyers could spend years implementing its excellent advice.	2002-05-02

This book is not only accurate and progressive, it's funny. The author has mixed in humor with sound writing advice, and the result is a lively and common-sense approach to plain English. Note that the book is a British publication, so some of the examples may be unfamiliar to U.S. readers. But all the tips and suggestions are right on. (Note: the book credits &quot;Plain English Campaign&quot; as the author, but it seems to have been written by the Director, Chrissie Maher.)	2002-05-02

I'm weary of the Bluebook.<br />I am a teacher of legal research and writing--I've been using and teaching the Bluebook for over 10 years. Other than teachers like me, who have to use it, I think the only people who actually use the current Bluebook are law review and journal editors at law schools. That's about it. Everyone else tries to get their citation form right without having to consult the Bluebook. Why?<br />It's a nightmare to use. Exceptions are presented as rules, with the rule buried where you'd expect an exception. The examples are often baffling, and you must puzzle out how they reflect the rule they are supposedly an example of. And can someone tell me why we need TWO typeface conventions--one for practitioner documents and one for law reviews? Surely those differences began when practitioners used typewriters and law reviews were professionally printed. But it's 2002! We all have word processors now.<br />(This review refers to the 17th edition published in 2000).	2002-05-02

Do you edit your documents based on vaguely-recalled rules from junior high? Do you turn to a colleague when you have a question about grammar, punctuation, usage, or style? Do you rely on old forms to prepare professional documents? Stop it. The answers are here; the source is the Redbook. It's the ultimate guide to writing correctly. Every lawyer should get it and use it.	2002-04-30

It's easy to read and understand. And it's painstakingly accurate. It far outstrips all the previous editions of Black's Law Dictionary. The previous editions were mostly just reports of how courts had used the words. This edition is, instead, a true dictionary--defining what legal words mean and relying not only on cases but on a wide array of legal texts. Plus, it is written by the most well known expert in the field.<br />The Pocket Edition might get you through law school, but practicing lawyers need this one.	2002-04-30

Books	5	9	11	N	N	Great advice from someone who knows.

If you have a question about a legal word or about legal writing, look it up here. You'll find the answer, and you're also likely to find a lively and intelligent discussion on the point. But the best thing about DMLU2 is that it's correct. So use it for back-up when you need to be right. Every lawyer should have it.	2002-04-15

Remember that it's more than a writing book; that ought to help get you through the rather dry opening chapters on Process, Substance, and Concepts. From there, you'll be treated to a thorough and modern guide to legal drafting skills that balances the practical with the precise. Excellent for law students and great for practicing lawyers.	2002-04-15

Go ahead and use this book as a reference. Skim it once in a while to refresh your memory about correct legal style. But don't sit down and read it straight through, as I did. I found it slow going and dry.	2001-11-20
