From a writer's perspective, I thought Bass did an excellent job. From a trader's perspective--and as someone who has long been pursuing the intersection of market behavior, psychology and the physical sciences--the story was solid. The Predictors reads like an expanded New York Times feature or multi-part Wired article... educational and modestly challenging, yet focused on entertainment and accessibility more than hard fact or theory.<br /><br />The way Bass lays it out, Prediction Company could be any technology startup. But the story is extremely well told, and interesting in its own right (in my opinion). Rather than driving the narrative, the financial and scientific elements are woven around and through the major events and milestones of the company. The triumphs and trials of the characters are the central thrust of the book.<br /><br />There are no major revelations, but dozens of interesting and entertaining observations. You get a whirling gestalt of chaos theory and the financial world, not deep detail. The quotes leading off each chapter were excellent, and the balance of description to storytelling, while clearly weighted towards storytelling, was good.<br /><br />The scientific and financial explanations were meant to spark curiosity, not sate it. I can see why some were disappointed, but I get the impression they were wanting a different book... more of an instruction manual or a doctoral thesis. (If you came to this story expecting clues to the holy grail, you were seriously reaching for your fifteen bucks.)<br /><br />Reading the book in 2005, I enjoyed the suspense of not knowing whether Prediction Company actually pulled it off. Did they make it for the long haul? It appears so, as they are still in business and still working with UBS. In fact trading algorithms are now hailed as a new frontier on Wall Street. A recent article in the Economist highlighted the intense competition to build intelligent software programs (robo-traders one might call them) designed to minimize the visible footprints of large orders and execute complex arbitrage strategies in multiple markets simultaneously.<br /><br />So do old school flesh and blood traders have reason to fret? It depends on the timeframe. Will outfits like Prediction Company and Renaissance Technologies eventually suck all the profit out of markets? Probably not.<br /><br />These guys occupy a very specific niche in the market ecosystem. Before the onslaught of computers, human floor traders provided vital liquidity to the markets (and got paid plenty well to do so). As physical exchanges lumber towards extinction, `smart' algorithms are filling the shoes of floor traders, extracting profits tick by tick with high volume, high frequency strategies. These automated players are thus becoming the new liquidity providers and market makers of the 21st century. Daytraders and scalpers may find themselves swept up in a technological arms race, but longer term traders and investors have little to fear... it's a different game.isible footprints of large orders and execute complex arbitrage strategies in multiple markets simultaneously.

US	49345585	RX40PM7ZWS6FO	0471215511	673039279	The Logical Trader	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	All about structure	I picked up The Logical Trader on the strength of the foreword. Paul Tudor Jones has added this to the short-list of books he recommends to new traders. Since PTJ is one of my earliest and strongest inspirations, such an endorsement is impossible to ignore.<br /><br />I have not adopted the ACD system--my methodology and market philosophy stands on its own two feet--but nor did I expect to. Instead the book proved worthwhile, as I suspected it would, from a different angle: it serves as further validation of the core principles behind successful trading, and it underlines the fact that, even for the best of the best, there are no magic secrets hidden away. (Okay, Jim Simons over at Rentech is sitting on a pile of arcane equations that non-PhDs have little hope of understanding; but 'high frequency finance' aside, the wisdom still applies.)<br /><br />As PTJ noted in Market Wizards, all forms of trading are ultimately systematic. Every human decision is based on some form of logic, conscious or otherwise, even if the `logic' in question is nothing more than base fight-or-flight response. So when you think about it, a trader really has three options when it comes to developing a methodology:<br /><br />1) He can hack away and reinvent the wheel on a regular basis, making arbitrary decisions over and over without examining them or even being consciously aware of them. This is otherwise known as beating your head against the wall.<br /><br />2) He can develop a system `in his head' through years of trial and error + costly experience, purging mistakes through sheer repetition and dogged determination. This is learning the hard way (maybe the hardest way), unless one has the good fortune of an excellent teacher / mentor at hand.<br /><br />3) He can consciously commit to the development of a robust 'system'--be it discretionary, mechanical or a blend of both--recognizing the need for structure and articulated reasoning. Through a deliberate process, mistakes are analyzed and rules reviewed with an eye for consistency and improvement over time, allowing the methodology to evolve into something sound and useful.<br /><br />Mark Fisher's gift, in addition to the ACD system itself, is clarifying by example how vital it is for a trader to reach level three. In creating a flexible structure and abiding by a clear set of rules, the discretionary trader ultimately finds himself liberated. As good brakes on a Porsche enable more speed on curvy mountain roads, intelligent trading guidelines enable more freedom and versatility rather than less.<br /><br />Why? Because when the method of operation is defined and systematized, the core elements no longer require conscious thought (or very little conscious thought) to execute in real time. Given enough familiarity and conviction, the basic workings of the method no longer take up valuable real estate in the conscious mind; instead, the rules are 'unpacked' into the vast airplane hangar of the subconscious.<br /><br />With the conscious mind no longer burdened by a need to reinvent the wheel / make arbitrary decisions / create structure on the fly, stress levels go down and awareness levels go up. It becomes easier to pay more attention to subtleties, take in more information, analyze more markets, engage in further R&D, or simply trade in a more relaxed and confident way.<br /><br />Contemplating one's methodology this way, and recognizing the need for internal structure as well as external understanding, is a big step for most traders. With The Logical Trader, Mark Fisher does more than provide the guts of a successful system. He removes some of the mystery in understanding how great traders approach markets, and puts many of his readers on a more fruitful path.and rules reviewed with an eye for consistency and improvement over time, allowing the methodology to evolve into something sound and useful.<br /><br />Mark Fisher's gift, in addition to the ACD system itself, is clarifying by example how vital it is for a trader to reach level three.

In his words, he started out trying to imagine what economic historians would be writing about a hundred years on. Realizing they would focus on the grand sweeping movements (to the exclusion of minor fluctuations), Coxe felt motivated to do the same.<br /><br />Triple waterfall theory is a variation on a popular asset allocation theme, namely that the ultimate investment strategy only requires one or two major decisions per era. As research house Gavekal puts it, imagine being fully vested in gold and oil through the 1970s, going on vacation, coming back to buy Japan and zero coupon bonds for the 1980s, hitting the beach for ten years more, then scooping up tech stocks and JGBs for the 1990's. (For this decade the smart play has been Asia and commodities, though of course we are only half through.)<br /><br />It is unsurprising to Coxe, and to students of market history in general, that Wall Street is still fighting the last war. As of this writing, crude is rapidly reapproaching $60 a barrel, copper is pushing multi-decade highs, and gold has aggressively decoupled from the dollar as fiat currency worries deepen. Yet the investment houses continue their conceptual love affair with bedraggled and besotted tech stocks, dismissing inflation as benign and the natural resource resurgence as a flash in the pan.<br /><br />Coxe's triple waterfall theory is meant to help you avoid making this type of classic mistake. He tours historical events and makes a powerful argument for a disconcerting conclusion: When an asset class goes through a triple waterfall, it doesn't just fall out of favor temporarily. (And if you think the term 'waterfall' is overly dramatic, just pull up a monthly chart of the Philly semiconductor index.) The exile can last for decades, as gold bugs who spent twenty years out in the cold well know.<br /><br />In addition to warning investors against the danger of hapless old flames, Coxe offers up a \\"taxonomy of bears,\\" dissecting the rhyme and reason of past bear markets. While his terms are overly cute--teddy bear, baby bear, papa bear etc--the reasoning is sharp and well thought out. He also brushes the dust off a reliable but obscure indicator, the TED spread, and explains why it still has great value during times of international crisis.<br /><br />One [Amazon] review is pretty harsh on Coxe for his poor mutual fund performance, also nitpicking some demographic predictions and a lack of options coverage. This sounds a lot like sour grapes to me. The purpose of the book is to present ideas and insight based on market history, so what do I care about an offhand view on Latin assimilation... and why would anyone expect an options primer? To me, the book rests squarely on the value of the insights--the big takeaways--and by that measure it's a good read. (A fast one too... I finished it on a coast-to-coast plane trip.)<br /><br />As I peruse more reviews, I'm realizing that my viewpoint is often at odds with other readers. I truly enjoy market history, original thought, and well written 'big picture' perspectives. Sometimes I get the feeling this is uncommon, and that many are looking for some kind of concrete instructional payoff along the lines of 'do exactly this and this.' If that's what you want, you're barking up the wrong tree (with Coxe's book). In contrast, if you like doing your own thinking and enjoy seasoned perspectives, you'll be pleased.a \\"taxonomy of bears,\\" dissecting the rhyme and reason of past bear markets.

Of course McDermott has to learn the hard way, as most all poker players (and traders) do. Marcel Link reminds me of Knish: a guy who's been around the block and pretty much seen it all. A grinder, trading to make a living... not going for the glory, just going for consistency. Bringing it home, month after month, and putting food on the table.<br /><br />This book is the next best thing to having a brother, cousin or close friend in the business. Link is someone who knows the angles, has taken the bad beats, and can tell you the tricks of the trade and the mistakes to watch out for.<br /><br />Right off the bat, wannabe traders are hit with hard facts: \\"In my opinion, to be realistic and have a fighting chance to succeed one should have a minimum of $25,000 to $50,000, a 3-year horizon, and a very understanding spouse.\\" In the intro, Link also explains how his own personal 'tuition' period lasted seven years. These are tough numbers for a tough game, and I respect Link for not pulling any punches. Many books on trading, if not most, tend to gloss over harsh realities in order to keep the dabblers and daydreamers interested. Not this one.<br /><br />This book will not make you a great trader, but that's not the point. It's more like a thorough recap of the fundamentals--the basic movements and processes that make up a trader's mindset. I wish I had a book like this when I was starting out. The road wouldn't have been any easier, but some of the key lessons might have 'sunk in' faster.<br /><br />If you are experienced in the markets, or even just competent, you won't find much of anything new here. It's pretty much all meat-and-potatoes type stuff. You might find it refreshing, though, to have such a comprehensive reference of the 'basics' packed into one volume.<br /><br />One caveat is that most of Link's examples are geared towards short-term trading, i.e. intraday, and are intentionally kept simple. So if you are a swing trader, more comfortable with longer timeframes, or looking for fancy moves, you might feel the book isn't geared to you as much. The basics are still the basics though, regardless of your time frame: core concepts like volatility, risk management, position sizing, reaction to news, and so on.<br /><br />To become great, or even just good, you'll need to go well beyond the scope of \\"High Probability Trading.\\" But before you can be either of those, you have to lay a rock solid foundation.

US	49345585	R1FT78WYTZJVBC	0471463396	945463677	Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond	Books	4	2	2	N	N	High marks from a macro guy	The back cover bills this book as `a must read for all disciples of value investing.' I don't exactly qualify as a traditional value investor, yet I found the book quite valuable.<br /><br />Greenwald and company do an excellent job in distilling the essence of value investing, giving an objective sense of what it is and how it's done. The picture they paint is clear and structured, yet flexible enough to cover the various manifestations of value investing out there.<br /><br />If you view the market as a sort of investment ecosystem, with multiple survival strategies in use--all of them interacting and influencing one another--then you naturally want to have an understanding of the strategies out there besides your own. In this sense, the mindset of the value investor is as interesting as the specific analytical tools he or she uses. And given the countless billions devoted to value, these guys leave an `ecological footprint' that can't be ignored.<br /><br />It's also interesting to note that value investing is far from simple and far from easy. As the book notes, Graham's treasured `net-net' situations have all but disappeared, except in cases where the company is on the brink of collapse or destined for slow demise. Furthermore, value investors profess to be `bottom up' rather than `top down,' and are actively disdainful of macro analysis on the whole... yet calculating `cost of capital,' a key element of valuation, is very much a macro exercise!<br /><br />To properly value the cash flow stream in question, you must benchmark it against the comparative risk-adjusted return, or `cost of capital,' demanded by investors. But to know what general level of return will be demanded by investors... i.e. to know the cost of capital... you will need to have a feel for interest rates, risk appetite, appeal of alternative asset classes, general propensity for valuations to expand or compress within the given time period, and so on. In other words, macro stuff.<br /><br />I found it ironic that such a basic tool of micro fundamentalists (discounted cash flow) turns out to be so macro dependent. To their credit, Greenwald & co. take this deficiency head on: \\"We should be struck here by a glaring inconsistency between the precision of the algebra and the gross uncertainties infecting the variables that define the model.\\" No kidding!<br /><br />They go on to note that `terminal value', in most cases the largest determination of net present value, can vary by huge margins in either direction based on small adjustments to initial input. In other words, a small fudge in your NPV (net present value) calculation can steer you hundreds of miles off course. But perhaps this is where the \\"margin of safety\\" comes in... value investors prefer plenty of elbow room to account for potential gigantic holes in their calculations, as well as hit-or-miss timing.<br /><br />After highlighting the follies of NPV, the book introduces Graham and Dodd's alternative methodology. In essence, G&D place much more emphasis on the certain present relative to the uncertain future. This creates issues of its own, however: For example, how do you value the intangible assets of an innovation-based company in a knowledge-based economy? How do you value things like strategic relationships and branding? How do you account for political risk, technological risk, demographic risk, etc?<br /><br />Perhaps the short answer is: as a `pure' value investor, you don't. You stick to your knitting and ignore the stuff that can't be nailed down. And yet, that answer doesn't really fly, because one of the things Graham and Dodd consider is the `franchise value'... which certainly can't be nailed down, is tough to account for on a balance sheet, and is subject to substantial change over time given ever-shifting landscapes.<br /><br />The point here isn't to suggest value investing is inherently flawed. Rather, it's to point out that successful value investors are much more than pure number crunchers. To do it right, they have to get into a lot of those nebulous, gray areas that dilute the purity of the discipline. \\"Dollar bills for fifty cents\\" just ain't that easy, and cheap is only good in the right context. I also had to wonder, how much of value investing is really just long range timing based on market cycles. Meaning take your shots occasionally, but mostly wait for those once-in-a-decade opportunities to load up on good assets marked down heavily, when Mr. Market is on Prozac, Xanax and Lexipro all at once.<br /><br />Objections aside, the value method can work well for its disciples. It just isn't the be-all-end-all that some make it out to be. There are many paths up the mountain, and value investing is but one of them. (Funny how the followers of feted disciplines often look down on or belittle the other paths, seeing their way as the \\"only\\" way. But that's actually a credit to this book, as Greenwald recognizes and acknowledges there are other paths that work too.)<br /><br />The second half of the book (a profile of eight value investors) was entertaining and informative, a cross-section of the value investing mindset in application. The section on Buffett got me thinking about his money troubles--that is, the trouble with investing $100 billion plus--and how Buffett's size issues reflect on the discipline of value investing as a whole. Could Berkshire Hathaway itself be overplayed? When a company reaches its peak valuation in the fullness of time, a disciplined value investor cashes out at least some, if not all, of their position. Can the Oracle of Omaha apply the same discipline to his own shop?<br /><br />In the world of commodities trading, the biggest CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors) are trend followers, with tens of billions under management. Trend following is a wholly different strategy than value investing, with an entirely different niche in the ecosystem, and yet the big problem faced by trend followers and value investors is the same. That problem is: when there are too many others pursuing your strategy, the level of returns will erode until enough players are shaken out to make the strategy profitable again.<br /><br />Greenwald believes that value opportunities will always persist, and gives a number of reasons why institutions and large fund managers will continue to overlook value based opportunities. But he doesn't mention the proliferation of hedge funds which, in spite of bad press, is likely to only increase over the years. Rather than a top-heavy institutional model, perhaps we will ultimately see a much larger number of private money managers, with smaller funds in the tens of millions rather than large ones in the hundreds of millions or billions. And these guys will have no problem going against conventional Wall Street wisdom in pursuit of superior returns... making the value world that much more competitive, and good values that much harder to find.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm not sure how well this book plays with dyed-in-the-wool value investors (as I am not one of them). But if you're new to value, or experienced in a different discipline and curious as to how the value guys think, I can definitely give it an enthusiastic thumbs up.bulous, gray areas that dilute the purity of the discipline. \\"Dollar bills for fifty cents\\" just ain't that easy, and cheap is only good in the right context.

US	49345585	R10Z76DD9SWH0U	0471650919	788940304	Trading Risk: Enhanced Profitability through Risk Control	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	A Worthy Investment	Note: as it stands, my review barely scratches the surface of this noteworthy book. I intend to return to here, and delve much deeper, at some point down the road. (Had we but world enough and time...)<br /><br />My attitude towards trading books is this: if I come away with at least one good idea or useful insight, the cost of purchase is paid for a hundred times over. Ken Grant's book contains a handful of useful ideas for improving performance, and some interesting perspectives to boot. When someone has worked with the best of the best (Jones, Cohen, et. al) their views carry weight. Ideas aside, I found Grant's overall philosophy of risk to be worth the price of admission.<br /><br />While the subject matter doesn't delve especially deep, this isn't a book for beginners. To fully appreciate the observations, a little seasoning is required. Grant speaks to those with a well developed respect for the markets, typically earned by grinding it out, experiencing the inevitable ups and downs over time, and taking a good hard knock or two. If you are a beginning trader still in the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed phase (having not yet received your first frying pan to the face), this book may bore you. If you are a crusader in search of the holy grail, or a techno-junkie hooked on chart patterns and oscillators, the lack of packaged advice may frustrate. But... if you have been around the block, seen the ups and downs, and love the game enough to make excellence and longevity your true ideals, then this book might be for you.<br /><br />Another great thing about Trading Risk is the way new light gets shed on `dull' concepts. These are important ideas that routinely get the short shrift. Sure, you may know all about standard deviations and portfolio adjustment; but can you see the forest for the trees? Maybe yes, maybe no... but for those who say `nothing new here,' I question how hard they actually looked. Risk Management as an Investment--one of the book's key themes--is a rich concept with multiple layers, and well worth delving into.e layers, and well worth delving into.	2005-05-07
US	49345585	R3GZGU0O5TCW9Y	1576601390	288254042	The Trader's Guide to Key Economic Indicators	Books	3	68	71	N	N	Useful as a reference guide, could have been much more	This book contains lots of factual information and useful overviews as to what the key economic indicators are, how they are constructed, what their purpose is, and how they work. With that said, it felt more like a pocketbook of facts and figures, similar to the ones published by The Economist, than an actual \\"guide\\" for traders.<br /><br />In the introduction, the book is offered as a useful source for anyone new to these indicators, but Yamarone never really mentions one of the most important aspects of trading: how to prioritize information flow.<br /><br />The drawback of fundamental trading is the susceptibility to \\"analysis paralysis,\\" i.e. the danger of information overload causing you to freeze like a deer in the headlights. On the other side of the coin, traders who try to digest a mountain of information without prioritizing it are more likely to make their decisions based on a handful of dominating factors, or even hunches, and then simply use the additional supportive data they find to justify those decisions. Studies of decision-making habits conducted on CIA intelligence analysts show that, when there is a surplus of information, it's a natural tendency to use only a small portion of the information available, while incorrectly assuming that all of it is being utilized.<br /><br />Yamarone does not mention these pitfalls, nor does he cover the reality of theme trading and indicator fashion. Indicators and market relationships go in and out of style, much like short skirts or thigh high boots on the catwalks of Paris and Milan. Traders will collectively switch their focus from one relationship to another, one data set to another, and so on; the trade deficit means nothing for a while, then suddenly it means everything. The Employment Situation is critical for a time, then later inconsequential as long term yields come to the fore. It's all about context, and that isn't addressed at all.<br /><br />In writing for a large audience, Yamarone also made sure to keep his opinions bland and uncontroversial. I found this a little disappointing in terms of what was left out. For example, consider this tidbit from the chapter on New Residential Construction:<br /><br />\\"Before the 2001 recession, housing starts were the most reliable and accurate measure of U.S. economic health... the 2001 recession broke this pattern. Housing starts remained strong during the downturn because historically low inflation kept mortgage rates low...\\"<br /><br />For a student of economic history--or a trader wishing to profit from macroeconomic movements--this is highly provocative subject matter. Questions come tumbling forth: Has a longstanding relationship been declared invalid by the 2001 pattern, or was it a case of unprecedented doubling down via credit stimulus? Were mortgage rates low simply because inflation was low, or more because the fed was hell-bent on pumping easy money into the economy to avoid a reckoning? Is it historically a good thing to try and avoid all painful recessions, or are painful recessions occasionally necessary, as a cleansing process after a period of extreme speculative excess, with bad-to-worse consequences for putting them off? Is there greater risk when a paper asset bubble transitions into a real estate valuation bubble?<br /><br />Yamarone sails past all of this, like an amateur checkers player doing commentary for a chess tournament. My guess is that he is well aware of these subtexts, but his overriding goal was to avoid fistfights and not offend anyone.

Not so much due to the breathtaking scope of financial disaster, but rather the timeless human lessons presented in such fascinating detail.<br /><br />If it were a movie, the plot might be dismissed as unrealistic. The heroes (anti-heroes?) of LTCM make choices so obtuse, they literally boggle the mind. You would think the most sophisticated players in the most sophisticated markets in the world would have a keen grasp of simple things, like position sizing. These guys were nobel laureates, ubergeeks with multiple PhDs, the high quants of Salomon. You would assume they had an assortment of complex and finely tuned algorithms, implemented in real time via massive computing power, to determine the proper size of positions.<br /><br />And yet, when LTCM came a cropper, it was in large part simply because their positions were too big. Not just a bit too big: ridiculously, massively, insanely too big. Technical details aside, the how of their failure is not as interesting as the why. As in Why, Oh Why did these guys think they were invincible?<br /><br />Conviction cuts both ways. Without it, you can't achieve anything truly noteworthy. With too much of it, you're likely to drive yourself over a cliff. As the old saying goes... those whom the gods would destroy, they first make confident. These guys' conviction levels made UFO suicide cults look modest. I mean, when you feel strongly about something, you increase the size of your bet. If you feel very strongly, maybe you bet a significant portion of your net worth. But what do you call it when you bet not only a few hundred times your net worth, but that of your friends and clients as well... when you act with a certainty on par with the sun coming up tomorrow? At least they walked the walk; by doubling and trebling down on their own personal stakes, the partners went out of their way to ensure they had more exposure than anyone. True believers to a man.<br /><br />The details are complex, but the heart of the story is simple. Genius did not just fail, it got hijacked and turned against itself. A sufficiently intelligent and creative person can convince him(or her)self of anything, no matter how outlandish, given strong enough emotional motivation to do so. Rationality was outflanked by ego, smarts subsumed by pride... in the normal world there are checks and balances on this sort of thing. If you start thinking you are a modern day Icarus, you are usually brought back to earth by various limits and circumstances (friends and family if you are lucky) before inflicting too much damage. But if the people around you actively encourage your hubris--if they whisper sweet nothings in your ear and hoist you on high--there's no telling how far your delusions may take you.<br /><br />In the end, all the credentials and intelligence, all the skills and smarts presented on a silver platter, didn't mean a damn thing. This is instructive and eye opening; the emperor has no clothes. Those outside Wall Street typically assume that those on the inside know what's going on. That the monolothic skyscrapers, the PhDs in mathematics and physics, the rows of supercomputers all mean something. That these people have some intrinsic grasp of reality that the rest of us do not, that they know exactly what they are doing at all times.<br /><br />But they don't. Or if they do, they can still fall prey to the reign of emotions and the folly of the human heart. This lesson is never fully learned; bigger giants will fall.<br /><br />This isn't to paint all market players with the same brush. Just because LTCM flamed out in spectacular fashion doesn't mean every hedge fund is one bad day away from disaster. There are managers out there, running billions of dollars, whose success is measured in decades. But they are successful in the long term because they understand risk, they understand fallibility, and they know not to fly too close to the sun. Markets are like the ocean; you don't tryto tame the ocean. You respect it, or you pay the price.	2005-01-17

Well researched and well told, this book is both informative and misleading.<br /><br />Informative in that it shines a clear light on the dangerous attitudes and corrupt culture that led to the bubble and its burst; misleading in that it presents a limited picture, a partial explanation implicitly represented as complete.<br /><br />If a burned investor wished to understand the great bull's violent death, and had this book as a sole reference, he would likely assume that bubbles are largely the result of lax standards and creeping corruption, and thus likely infer an off-base conclusion: that future bubbles can somehow be prevented with a combination of better rules and tighter governance. The stories of Worldcom and Enron are informative and well told, but do they really count as 'origins' of the mania, rather than indirect creations of it?<br /><br />A student of market history might suggest that most, if not all, big bull runs end in delusion and creeping corruption. As enthusiasm turns to mania, mania causes normally rational individuals to `take leave of their senses,' and desperate measures are implemented at the last in vain hope of keeping the dream alive.<br /><br />Does endemic corruption lead to mania, or does the onset of mania lead to corruption as an inexorable byproduct of the times? The question, as it applies to this book, is whether situational specifics matter as much as understanding the age old cycle of boom and bust itself.<br /><br />Consider Adam Smith's excellent book, The Money Game, which details dramatic boom and bust in the 1960s (and the all too familiar culture behind it all). Similar stories, similar players, similar reasons for excitement--even the 1960s version of dotcoms and the foreshadowing of Enron--and, of course, a violent and painful ending when it all comes crashing down.<br /><br />Going back further, to 1929, or still further to tulipmania and the South Sea bubble, it could be argued that bubbles remain constant in caricature, with only details changing. Perhaps we are travelling along an expanding sine / cosine wave of boom and bust, as the cycles speed up and leverage allows for ever more spectacular highs and lows.<br /><br />Origins of the Crash brings forth a number of useful insights. For instance, the wonderfully cynical notion that the efficient market hypothesis may does harm than good. To wit, the assumption of rationality actually makes the markets less rational by functioning as a rubber stamp; if stock prices are assumed always and everywhere reasonable, then incredible price movements are deemed reasonable by default, and the boosters are given perfect cover. Lowenstein also gives the phrase \\"shareholder value\\" a thoroughly sound thrashing, shedding light on insular corporate culture generally and gross CEO excess specifically. Exposing that culture down to the roots is the main aim of this book.<br /><br />I was quite suprised, though, to see that a book called Origins of the Crash said nothing about so many major factors that came into play. For example, the fact that we were at the tail end of a record period of peacetime expansion that had been going on since 1982, with only one or two brief and limited interruptions. The fact that we were enjoying a \\"goldilocks economy\\" in the late 90's as the result of a long-fought battle with inflation that was finally paying dividends. And what about the major role played by the federal reserve vis a vis multiple events that spurred massive liquidity injections: Asian currency crisis, Russian default, LTCM meltdown, preY2K fears, etcetera. Nothing said of monetary policy, the boom / bust cycle of credit or the hidden inflationary consequences of easy money (namely, the tendency for fed induced liquidity to go directly into stocks and, as of this writing, real estate).<br /><br />Nor did Lowenstein really address the compelling nature of the dot com story, except in brief passing. He noted that a seachange technology often leaves a vast litany of losers behind (railroads / automobiles etc), and that mass consumer benefits do not equal mass profits for companies riding the risky edge of innovation. He also noted the impossible driver of the mania... the notion that internet traffic was doubling four times a year to infinity.<br /><br />But so much more could be said! Hyperbole aside, the information age really does change things dramatically; just not overnight. That line of thinking could have been, and should have been in my view, more deeply explored. Speaking of which, here are two of my favorite quotes from the book that practically beg for more discussion:<br /><br />\\"...Finance has its own Peter Principle, by which a successful model will be adapted to progressively riskier causes until it fails.\\"<br /><br />\\"...There is always a germ of truth, a half-fact or momentary fact that, taken to hyperbole, can justify the most fantastic projections.\\"<br /><br />For any student of the markets, this is well worth the read (and at 227 compact pages it's a fast read); Lowenstein's book is practically a modern day addendum to Mackay's seminal Popular Delusions & The Madness of Crowds. But rather than title it Origins of the Crash, it might be more representative to see it as \\"A Slice of the Crash\\" or \\"Culture of the Crash.\\" In focusing on creeping corruption and chicanery born of desperation, this book is more a cross section of details for a particular late great mania, rather than a deep chronicle of its origins.t mass consumer benefits do not equal mass profits for companies riding the risky edge of innovation.

One is a narrative of the late great dot-com boom, told from the perspective of a player at the right place and the right time (with the good sense to walk away at the right time also). The other is sort of an informal investment thesis, a collection of controversial and intriguing ideas that hang together and form an actionable set of guidelines.<br /><br />It's all tied together with a dry (Sahara desert dry) sense of humor and a knack for understatement that made me laugh out loud more than once. (Example: when a sarcastic friend says never buy a stock where the name is a target forecast for the price, Kessler makes a mental note: \\"avoid NetZero.\\" Another example: \\"If you buy a stock at $70 and it goes to $200, it's tough to sell, figuring it might go to $300. If you bought at $3, it's a lot easier to sell.\\")<br /><br />The title of the book is fairly misleading. Anyone expecting a testosterone-fueled read is bound to be disappointed. Kessler is a cerebral investor, not a hairy chested alpha-male trader, and he makes that abundantly clear (in spite of his zillion-percent-annualized return gained from flipping mp3.com, a sixty second trade worthy of any gunner's respect).<br /><br />The fact that Kessler's outfit is a hedge fund is largely irrelevant to the book, as he doesn't go short and doesn't get fancy. (In fact he is snickered at by niche-based peers for not doing anything particularly sexy or exotic.) And when all is said and done, his 50%+ average return shows that you don't have to trade like a banshee or be a genius / hero to make a killing. Being in the right place at the right time, and playing it to the hilt, is enough. (Of course, that's also the rub.)<br /><br />The stories are entertaining. Far better, the ideas are valuable. (You have to take them with a grain of salt, but that should go without saying.) I appreciated Kessler's concept of \\"waterfalls,\\" giving a mental picture of technology's promise as an investment vehicle. Pressure builds in some area of inefficiency or untapped opportunity, creating a pool of latent opportunity. Finally the barrier breaks, the waterfall bursts forth, and innovation cascades outward--first to the early adapters, then the commercial adapters, and then the general masses. As prices fall dramatically, unit volume increases far more dramatically and, hopefully, exponential profits are created in the process. Kessler highlights Microsoft as one of the greatest (and luckiest) waterfall examples of all time, thanks to the master stroke of tying software to hardware. Every box sold puts another sale in their pocket, and with someone else building the box, they maintain zero replication cost and 99% profit margins. Beautiful.<br /><br />Kessler also takes us on a tour of the industrial revolution, courtesy of an intellectual exercise spurred by the friendly investor and erstwhile gnome of Zurich \\"Mr. Zed.\\" After following the progress of the steam engine and the Niagara Falls opportunity in textiles, Kessler transitions from old school to new school with his \\"margin surplus\\" theory, which seeks to replace yesterday's manufacturing model with an intellectual property one.<br /><br />Along the way he points out how IP (intellectual property) and physical manufacturing have been effectively split up for the first time in history, allowing Intel and Microsoft to make 80-99% margins on products bundled with every Sony laptop sold, while Sony itself sees maybe 1% returns after the hassle of buying materials, paying for labor, assembling the boxes, managing inventory and shipping them out.<br /><br />Thus the United States gets the lion's share of pure profit through intellectual property value-add, whereas Asia (or wherever the assembly occurs) gets traditional manufacturing sized margins (5% or less) on assembly and delivery, but benefits from mass employment and economic growth. Lots o' jobs is Asia's incentive to keep the high margin / lowmargin deal going (at least until they finally get innovative too, and start outsourcing to North Africa or some such place).<br /><br />The margin surplus theory is intriguing, and goes far in explaining why our trade deficit may not be as big a deal as some suggest. If Kessler is more or less correct, then a trade deficit is a natural--and even desirable--byproduct of an investment surplus, as the world continues to invest in our high margin IP profit centers, rather than the lower margin process of assembly taking place elsewhere.<br /><br />The theory doesn't address a few key nitpicks though, such as the frighteningly low rate of consumer saving in the United States... or the tendency we have to spend borrowed money on \\"stuff\\" rather than putting it back into productive investment... or the propensity of government to cheerfully run spending off the rails while whistlin' Dixie.<br /><br />Kessler is confident that the next round of spectacular innovation is likely to occur within the same twenty mile radius as last time, but here I fear he is overly optimistic. Even if margin surplus is more right than wrong, and even if IP invalidates gaping trade deficits and old economic models (two big ifs), America still has rough waters and real challenges ahead. Just because team USA was the innovation powerhouse of the 20th century doesn't mean we can `repeat the feat' in round 21.<br /><br />Edges can be dulled and edges can be lost. If innovation is going to keep saving our bacon from the deficit frying pan, someone needs to tell the politicians who are discouraging immigration (choking off our brain gain), letting trial lawyers run amok, and bleeding entrepreneurs with heightening cycles of tax and spend. With the baby boomer generation retiring and major fiscal battles ahead, this is no time to be complacent. If apathy sets in, innovation won't save us from decline... and the next big waterfalls could easily make a splash elsewhere.vative too, and start outsourcing to North Africa or some such place).

Investment Biker seemed to create extreme reactions, either loved or hated for its brashness. His follow up, Adventure Capitalist, is more sober and contemplative, though still fun.<br /><br />The four dominant themes of Adventure Capitalist are bureaucracy, border hazards, untapped potential, and the transient nature of greatness. Country after country shows promise, but opportunity is sadly drowned by mind-numbing red tape and colossal government ineptitude. Again and again there is trouble at the border, and disappointment inevitably follows. The country with a positive border crossing experience, China, is the only one Rogers is wildly bullish on. He sees Shanghai in the year 2004 as analogous to 1904 New York.<br /><br />With his father's illness as a backdrop, mortality is clearly on Rogers' mind. He refers often to the grand sweep of history, and predicts oblivion for many of the cities and some of the countries he passes through: Timbuktu, once great, now fading into nothing. Russia and Indonesia, countries dissolving into chaos. Saudi Arabia, reverting back to sand dunes centuries hence. Back in the United States, even the glitter and glitz of Vegas simply reminds Rogers of Ozymandias. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, nothing gold can stay. In the long run he's right, of course, but in the short run it's unclear what his message is, other than emphasizing the inevitability of change.<br /><br />Rogers' views on foreign aid to Africa and NGOs, backed up by frustrating firsthand experience, were particularly eye opening. His \\"Africa plan\\" makes a lot of sense, and it's sad to think first world countries are only making things worse for the third world with their current ham-fisted efforts.<br /><br />After the journey ends, we get a glimpse, or rather a written speech, detailing the big picture--the Jim Rogers macro view. Much of the world is still drowning in red tape, and America is slowly sinking into the muck. Buy China, buy commodities, and buy into war zones at the first sign of an olive branch.<br /><br />With the birth of his first child, there is more enthusiasm in the last two sentences than the last twenty pages. It's almost as if he were resigning himself to a humdrum existence, the grand adventure over and done, only to discover that being a father is a new adventure all over again. Cheers Jim.tape, and America is slowly sinking into the muck. Buy China, buy commodities, and buy into war zones at the first sign of an olive branch.

The English South Seas bubble took direct inspiration from John Law's Mississippi scheme; though Law crashed and burned, the Seven Seas directors fancied themselves smarter:<br /><br />\\"Wise in their own conceit, they imagined they could avoid his faults, carry on their schemes for ever, and stretch the cord of credit to its extremest tension, without causing it to snap asunder.\\"<br /><br />And so goes most every bubble to this day, as bankers, politicians and the investing public continue to fancy themselves smarter than their kind of yesteryear. Mackay's revered tome is as much an endorsement of Austrian Economics as it is a documentation of mob psychology. The boom and bust cycle is fueled by easy credit, let loose in hopes of keeping the party going. As the velocity of money increases, ever more disjointed arguments are trotted out to justify ever higher valuations. The frenzy intensifies to a point of unsustainability, the true believers falter, and then it all comes crashing back to earth again.<br /><br />Mackay also touches on the nature of bubbles as a wealth transfer mechanism from the many to the few. As in all bubbles, a handful of individuals walk away with dubious fortunes intact, leaving the scene (and often the country!) before the tide turns.<br /><br />Simple observation shows why the public must always lose: if a bubble is based on credit and speculation rather than real productivity and real gains, the excess valuations are not supported by any sustainable means, and the temporary wealth effect is actually just a crowd of people sending inflated sums back and forth. Like musical chairs, the only way to win this game is to stop playing before everyone else does.<br /><br />There is another amusing aspect to the book: the attempt of some pointy-headed academics to prove Mackay's bubbles justified, i.e. to say that fundamentals asupported the valuations. This incredible stretch seems more herculean than attempts to maintain respectability for the flat earth society.<br /><br />Whether or not a tulip bulb's DNA is sufficiently rare, regardless of the South Sea company's genuine trade prospects, only an ivory tower academic could be so willfully obtuse as to dismiss the sheer frenzy of the times. During the South Seas bubble--which touched off a number of lesser speculative schemes--a small fortune was collected (and spirited from the country) on the strength of the following prospectus: \\"a company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.\\" (Does that ring a dot com bell or what?)<br /><br />It's easy to look back and think, \\"How could those people be so stupid? Surely we couldn't be that stupid today?\\" But stupidity is not necessary for the inflating of a bubble. All you need is a positive situation with compelling fundamentals (and even the fundamentals are optional, if you have conditions that create an illusion of their existence).<br /><br />If the fundamentals justify rational valuation R, then the bubble inflates as multiples are notched up to R x (HC / P), where H = hype, C = credit flows and P = prudence. As greed kicks in, a good story morphs into a fairy tale, rationalizations abound, and prudence goes on vacation. The hand is inevitably overplayed. Easy credit fuels the fire as investors play ring around the rosie. Eventually they all fall down.<br /><br />Chances are, bubbles will always be with us; the necessary conditions for their forming are rooted in the human condition. New innovations and new growth stories--biotech, the rise of Asia, demographic shifts etcetera--will change the world in the long run while inspiring cyclical frenzy in the short run. The willingness of bankers, politicians and Wall Streeters to provide easy money is perhaps at a high point in history, and the public, as always, shows a remarkable lack of restraint with no sign of wising up.

The problem was the volume control mechanism embedded in the wall. At setting 1, the music was audible but too low to hear. At setting 2, the music was loud enough to disrupt concentration and made you jam the phone against your ear. I longed for a round knob control that offered a continuum, but alas, had to be satisfied with 1 or 2.<br /><br />This throwaway analogy illustrates Kosko's frustration with \\"bivalence.\\" We do not live in a black and white world; many things are in between, and science is silly to pretend otherwise. It is not just the engineers and physicists, of course. Economists also suffer greatly from this delusion (largely because much of economics is sociology dressed up in fancy math). Reality is messy, complex, and does not fit into a box. A simple statement at heart, but one with profound implications that Kosko does a decent job of exploring.<br /><br />With the statement \\"precision up, fuzz up,\\" Kosko reiterates a truth known since biblical times. I like T.S. Eliot's version, \\"All our knowledge only brings us closer to our ignorance.\\" The thrust is that excess information often obscures as much as it reveals. Relevant facts are lost in the wash of noise, like needles in the proverbial haystack. And even the relevant facts are subject to interpretation, counterweighting, and levels of degree.<br /><br />I felt that the systems Kosko described were not \\"fuzzy\\" as much as \\"flexible.\\" They still make black and white decisions, they just make a higher number of decisions and thus have a more averaged or \\"fuzzy\\" result. A machine that utilizes fifteen data points will be much more versatile and flexible than one that only uses two, but it is still a binary system at heart. Maybe our brains are binary as well, except with gazillions of data points to access. But that is a subject for another book (one by Penrose perhaps).<br /><br />Can computers optimize a set of rules, like those that apply to washing machines or traffic lights? Yes. Can they predict the future outcome of the stock market? No.<br /><br />The actions of a chaotic/reflexive system can never be predicted with true accuracy, because the stream of variables is too fast and furious to follow. Even for a supercomputer, it would be like drinking from a fire hose. Thousands of opinions converge and diverge every second. Unforeseen events jar the market like random electrical shocks. Feedback amplifies itself, the way a sound looped from speaker back to microphone becomes an ear splitting shriek. Feedback diffuses itself, like soft spring rain on a pond. The market measures itself and reacts to itself a thousand times a day, a living embodiment of the Heisenberg principle. The puzzle has a trillion pieces that spontaneously rearrange at will. You can stump a computer with the turbulence in a glass of water, and yet it's supposed to decipher mass interaction? I'm not holding my breath.<br /><br />As the book progresses, Kosko gets more and more wildly optimistic in his predictions of what fuzzy logic might be capable of, what fuzzy machines could do. He goes out on a limb and overshoots his premise by a country mile by the time you reach the last page, filling the last half of the book with rabbit trails, but that is okay by me. Fuzzy logic is his baby, his contribution to the world. So it is completely natural that he would bubble over with possibilities and offshoots of his original thesis.

(Paul Samuelson has dubbed The Money Game a \\"modern classic,\\" and it is).<br /><br />A brief but insanely great read, Adam Smith made me laugh out loud at least half a dozen times with his dry sarcasm and sardonic wit. If Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is an all-time ultimate classic for traders, then The Money Game is one of the all-time ultimate classics for investors.<br /><br />Written almost a decade before I was born, the book is just as relevant today as it was in the latter half of the sixties. The high flyers Smith writes about are so similar to those of the 1990's bubble, it is literally as if nothing but the symbols have changed (and perhaps the clothing styles). Sixties screamers like Brunswick and Solectron were bid up to hundreds of times earnings, then flamed out and fell through the floor with spectacular declines of 90% or more... just like the JNPR's and CMGI's and JDSU's of our more `enlightened' age. The Great Winfield, master tape reader of his day, is the perfect 1960's equivalent to the dotcom daytrader banging bids on Island or Selectnet. The technical analysts of the sixties, with their punch cards and their vacuum tube computers, are in perfect harmony with the high powered number crunchers and stochastics trackers of today.<br /><br />And when Smith discusses the complete and utter wackiness of corporate accounting methods, complete with a hundred and one ways to massage earnings statements six ways to Sunday while technically remaining within the law, you would swear he is foreshadowing the fall of Enron. And of course there is good old John Jerk, proud representative of the uninformed public... buying high, selling low, and generally getting taken behind the woodshed, just as he still is today.<br /><br />The old hands are always saying that the game is the same. (Jesse Livermore said it 80 years ago... no doubt some ancient mariner passed such words on to him.) Young gunslingers and wet behind the ears traders nod and smile, because they know the old timers are wise--yet the youngsters are still naïve enough to harbor doubts in the back of their minds as to whether it is true. Is the game really and truly always the same? Couldn't it be different this time? Couldn't it?<br /><br />The Money Game goes a long way in putting the question to rest. There is no way a book written in 1966 could sound perfectly suited to 2001, no way that bowling stocks and fiber-optic packet-switching stocks could give near identical performances under mania circumstances, unless the game is indefinitely, immutably the same.<br /><br />And why shouldn't it be? We can put a man on the moon, but we certainly aren't any more humble or mature than we were yesterday. Our collective knowledge may increase, but greed and fear do as brisk a business as ever.<br /><br />Bravo Adam Smith (or should I say George Goodman). I don't know if you are even still alive to read this praise, but your book is as fresh today as it was the day you wrote it.behind the ears traders nod and smile, because they know the old timers are wise--yet the youngsters are still naïve enough to harbor doubts in the back of their minds as to whether it is true.

Though the book is old, the flavor and rhythms are timeless. Some of the criticism is fair, some of it unfair... yet many years later, it's the same old Street.<br /><br />Because Lewis writes dispassionately and objectively, his words hit home all the more. He comes across as a excellent story teller, not much more or less. (This seems to be the way he wants it.)<br /><br />In my earlier days of getting acquainted with markets, I often wondered how investment banks could hire rooms full of \\"traders\\" and have most of those traders be profitable. If trading requires a special talent or mindset, which it definitely seems to, how is it that all these ivy league guys can be good at trading en masse, especially when they have zero patience and huge egos?<br /><br />Based on the Liar's Poker picture, the answer is that most of the \\"traders\\" in the employ of large investment banks are not trading in the true sense of the word. They are either siphoning money from unwitting customers with the help of product-pushing salesmen (no different than run of the mill brokers, except higher class), or else they are taking a bite out of the bid/ask spread, which is what many floor traders do. In exchange for providing liquidity, floor traders act as slippage extractors of a sort; the `skid' you see between order price and fill price is what goes in their pocket. This type of thing is more about exploiting a structural advantage, and less about competition with other traders.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Michael Milken was one of the few who came out of this book looking like a winner. The rest of the world wrote Milken off as a crook without actually looking into what he did or how he made a fortune. Lewis gives a clear and lucid explanation of Milken's big idea--that the investment world as a whole had its credit rating apparatus backwards, due to a skewed perspective of corporate credit risk. The book recalls in some detail how Milken was able to leverage this single idea, with a sheer force of will, into billions of dollars in junk bond profits.<br /><br />As a side note, even after reading Den of Thieves (an excellent book that chronicles Milken's ultimate fall), I still wonder if he got the short end of the stick--painted as a crook because he was exceptionally greedy and made obscene amounts of money, rather than any truly grievous wrongdoing. The massive contribution Milken made to the capital markets was to reshape the assessment of credit overall, increasing the efficiency of capital deployment across the globe. This surely gives him claim to a better reputation than the one he's gotten from the press thus far.<br /><br />If you read this book and enjoy it, you might want to note that a 1990's successor to Liar's Poker is Fiasco: Blood in the water on Wall Street, written by another bond insider whose moral qualms eventually force him off the Street.s book looking like a winner.

US	49345585	R314D51QVD20RE	0812975219	866674811	Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets (Incerto)	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	This black swan is a ten star event	If you are a dyed-in-the-wool fundamental analyst, a puffed up CEO, a financial journalist, or a swaggering institutional trader, then odds are fair that you will hate this book with a passion, and feel equal parts loathing and resentment for its author. I am surprised that there are not more condescending or vicious one star reviews than the few I saw, seeing as this book is bound to offend just about every traditional Wall Street type there is (and they are not the most forgiving type).<br /><br />Being thousands of miles away from Wall Street in both mentality and location, I found this book to be effortlessly brilliant... one of the most insightful I have read in years. It comes across in the style of a casual coffee shop chat with an intelligent friend. Taleb does not assault your brain with new math or doctorate level concepts; rather, he points things out with such casual ease, you wind up wondering how you could have missed the clarity before. It is a case of adding valuable depth, rather than breadth, to knowledge of probability.<br /><br />I bought the book assuming Taleb would spend a lot of time arguing for the random walk theory of markets, when in fact the practical result appears to be the opposite. His thesis, as I see it, is that trading opportunities exist largely because man is genetically and societally programmed to be fooled by randomness, yet remains willfully oblivious to this fact... and thus the crowd creates exploitable market distortions through an ongoing series of irrational acts.<br /><br />The elements of humor and insight in this book are numerous, and I can't resist highlighting a few favorites. Taleb's observation of the \\"lucky fool\\" made me chuckle because I have come across, or heard of, so many lucky fools already over the course of my young career (like the friend of a client who turned 400K into 12 million pyramiding gains on a single tech stock in 1999, but then went bust on the ride back down because he was too naive to distinguish between skill and luck).<br /><br />Taleb's use of the \\"dentist's certainty\\" as a statistical average in comparing potential outcomes over numerous sample paths was very instructive, as were the final outcome examples of myopically aggressive traders John and Carlos in comparison to the cautious Nero Tulip. The powerful point is that it is easier not to be jealous of a mega-successful peer when it is known that the bulk of that peer's accomplishment was to be in the right place at the right time, suggesting the nature of their success--fortuitous gain from a random cycle or event--is of such ephemeral nature that it can disappear at any point (insert flashback to Nasdaq bubble here).<br /><br />Taleb's observation on the correlation between market observation and emotion was also excellent and original (to me at least). The lesson that even a high probability strategy will likely have negative emotional expectation over the short run, due to the exaggerated impact of negative emotions over positive ones, has many implications for those obsessed with watching every tick of their portfolios.<br /><br />In his thorough and methodical destruction of probability blind journalists, flavor of the month gurus and retrofitted market theorists, Taleb also highlights how the explosion of commentary and data in the information age arguably makes for worse trading decisions overall--and confers an advantage to the trader who can restrain himself from drowning in data. The way he watches CNBC also made me laugh out loud (read the book to find out why).<br /><br />He does not spare fund managers either, popping their balloonlike egos with a sharp argument based on the talented coin syndrome. Morningstar will not like his undeniable point that the majority of good track records taken from a large sample pool are based more on luck than skill... and that sudden and heavy advertising of such a track record only increases the likelihood that it is a statistical variance.<br /><br />Finally, I appreciated the way Taleb stresses firmly and repeatedly that one of his greatest strengths is knowing that he is weak. Humility is a sign of wisdom, and the proud generally have a shorter life expectancy, especially in markets. That, too, could be considered a central theme of this book.epeatedly that one of his greatest strengths is knowing that he is weak.

The majority will either shrug it off, ridicule it, misapply it, or flat out miss the point entirely.<br /><br />This book contains valuable wisdom... and you don't have to be a fan of eastern religion, aikido, or west coast liberalism to appreciate George Leonard's observations. (Book jackets and chapter headings often show the heavy hand of publishing-house salesmen; in the name of marketing they tend to inflate claims, stamp out nuance, and shout needlessly at a stereotyped target audience.)<br /><br />This book won't change your life, of course. Only you can do that. If you expect to walk away with some new power or magical understanding that you didn't have to earn, you'll be sorely disappointed (see wisdom characteristic #3 above). But the main idea that Leonard presents here, and the advice he gives regarding it, is worth taking very seriously and pondering in depth. Like most books that center around a powerful idea, the content weakens when Leonard strays from the main focus. But he strays little, and the main focus remains extremely valuable.<br /><br />This is not really a self-help book; nor is it really a motivational book. (Perhaps that is why I like it.) Leonard's goal is more to explain and to guide than to motivate. To stay on the path of mastery he describes, the passion must be cultivated separately (or already be in place). In other words, Mastery will not help you do better at your job if you are only working to bring home a paycheck; it will not help you improve in the hobby / pastime of your choice if it is just \\"something to do on weekends.\\" Books like this offer clues as to how passionate effort can best be directed. But without passion, the magic doesn't work. If you don't have at least one area, any area, where your motivation is in some part excellence for its own sake, then pass this one by. (Or better yet, find something excellent to get excited about!)<br /><br />As an investor and a trader, I would recommend this book to all who take their craft seriously. If you are already on the path, Mastery could help clarify an understanding that has been in the back of your mind all along.to do on weekends.\\" Books like this offer clues as to how passionate effort can best be directed.

This book meets his high standard of quality and informativeness. I can recommend this book to anyone looking to broaden their knowledge of fundamental analysis and the guts of what affects supply and demand. But I can't recommend the book wholeheartedly, because basing trading decisions on fundamental analysis in itself is such a flawed approach in my opinion.<br /><br />I used to pay a lot of attention to fundamentals (as a commodity broker). I would spend hours each day looking at news and research to get a feel for the reasoning behind the movement. After doing this for a while, I realized the inherent futility in the approach--if a trade sets up technically I will take it, unless there is some compelling reason not to--and if there is no technical confirmation, I won't take it, period. So fundamental analysis just doesn't play a starring role in either case. Nowadays, I still keep tabs on fundamentals, but mainly to avoid getting hit by a train; not taking action in front of a significant report, going short coffee in the freeze season, stuff like that. Below are a few reasons why my trading has taken on a strongly technical flavor:<br /><br />1) Most daily news is worthless, and here is why: at any given time, there seem to be half a dozen arguments for being bearish on a market, and half a dozen arguments for being bullish.<br /><br />When a market has a big move up and the reason isn't clear, the news services pick a couple of the bullish reasons and talk about those. If the market has a move down, they highlight some of the bearish reasons. It's total retrofitting, and thus usually a waste of time (in that there's not much of a way to turn that knowledge into profit).<br /><br />Furthermore, the \\"traders\\" that the newsies interview are often just run of the mill clerks or brokers who don't really know anything special... or if they do know, they aren't telling. The classic filler explanations on the aftermarket newswires center around buzz phrases like \\"profit taking,\\" \\"fund buying\\" and \\"fund selling.\\" When you read about one of those three, the general translation is that the reporter dragged out an old standby because \\"who the heck knows\\" just doesn't make good copy.<br /><br />2) Many of the best trades are the ones where the move starts before anyone knows why. Bruce Kovner talked about this concept in the first Market Wizards. If a breakout occurs when everyone is expecting it, then everyone is already in, and the odds are not as good because a lot of the buying (or selling) is already done. But if a breakout occurs and no one knows why, then there are 1) potentially powerful hidden reasons for the move, and (2) a whole group of traders who are not in the market yet, and may want or need to get in (or out if the move is against them) once the reason comes to light.<br /><br />So, by deduction, if some of the best trades are the ones where fundamental reasons are not yet clear, then by paying attention to fundamentals too much, you run the risk of keeping yourself out of the best trades. You have to be willing to sometimes say, \\"I don't know why this setup is occurring, but the technicals are tellling me something interesting that the news might confirm later.\\" Because the confirmation of \\"why\\" often comes after the window of opportunity has closed, you have to be willing to act before the fundamental reasons are clear.<br /><br />3) Analysts are often biased and have a hesitancy to change views. When an analyst writes down his opinion on a piece of paper and then sends it out for everyone to see, part of his (or her) pride and reputation is staked on that opinion. It is a psychological truth that writing something down, and confirming it to other people, makes a person more committed to that belief. (Humans have a very strong desire to be consistent.) That make the typical analyst very hesitant to change his mind, even when the facts change. If an analyst is bullish one week and then the facts turn bearish the next week, the analyst should change his mind--but the odds are that he will not, because he will be thinking \\"well, if I was bullish last week and do a 180 to bearish this week, then I will look stupid.\\"<br /><br />But often that is the right thing to do! Especially for fundamental analysis, being flexible is very important. But most analysts are too worried about their reputations to have that flexibility. This is one reason trends unfold over time--because the masses are hesitant to change their minds quickly, even as it becomes more and more clear that they should.<br /><br />4) Much of fundamental analysis is either incomplete or just plain wrong. Even if you have 90% of the puzzle pieces, the 10% that you are missing could be important enough to turn the whole picture upside down. Or if you somehow miraculously have all the pieces, you still have to figure out how to weight them properly and determine what the market is going to pay the most attention to. It is almost impossible to get all the facts correctly uncovered and assembled without overlooking anything.<br /><br />And then there is always the possibility that something could come up by surprise that you were not prepared for. Different analysts with access to the same information will often have directly contradicting opinions on a market. What does that tell you? Generally the only time that the analysts are all on the same page is when the writing on the wall is obvious... and by that time, the move is usually almost done if not over. There is simply no free lunch.<br /><br />5) Price--the ultimate value judgment of all underlying fundamentals--reveals itself in the technicals. The technicals don't lie (though they can certainly deceive), and they don't harbor an emotional bias. They represent the opinions of the entire market, with a heavier weighting towards the bigger and smarter players, and are thus more reliable than individual opinions subject to bias and error. For a fast mover such as myself, this is what needs to be known. As far as trading goes, I'm typically interested in the next three days or weeks... not the next three months or years.<br /><br />For the above reasons, fundamental traders caveat emptor.n analyst is bullish one week and then the facts turn bearish the next week, the analyst should change his mind--but the odds are that he will not, because he will be thinking \\"well, if I was bullish last week and do a 180 to bearish this week, then I will look stupid.\\"    But often that is the right thing to do!

Thus the average individual remains fundamentally vulnerable to manipulators.<br /><br />As I write this review in 2001 (post 9/11), the dangers that Cialdini writes of seem a striking parallel to the dangers of an open society, e.g., the open and free society we enjoy in America is vulnerable precisely because it is open and free.<br /><br />As a trader, I bought this book to hone my understanding of human psychology and various influences on the decision making process, in the hope that Cialdini would shed a light on the complex emotional processes that lead to buying and selling. He surely did.<br /><br />From this reviewer's vantage point, this book holds some offbeat yet powerful clues as to why the markets function the way they do (and why this will not change any time soon).

Farley's ratio is decent (plenty of substance, some hype but not an overbearing amount). He doesn't try and snow you with ridiculous claims, and he points out the pitfalls and uncertain nature of his methods. Sure it's frustrating to read about a technique, and then later read about how that technique is far from foolproof--kind of like saying \\"this method works except when it doesn't\\"... but, umm, that's exactly how markets are much of the time. Farley tells it like it is, and apparently from the way his reviewers went to extremes, some appreciated it and some were extremely bitter about it.<br /><br />A lot of people seemed turned off by Farley's writing style, but I found it refreshing. He repeats himself a little more frequently than I would like, but in his defense it is mainly when he is emphasizing an important point. His language and description create the sense of looking at a familiar object from a unique angle, revealing aspects of it that were previously overlooked.<br /><br />I suspect a lot of people were angry or disappointed because Farley left things open ended and didn't make any big promises. The truth is that this book will not make you a better trader. It will only make you more knowledgeable. Kind of like if your local mechanic gave you a presentation on how his tools worked. Does that make you a mechanic too? No. Can you become a Navy Seal by reading their training manuals, or a pro golfer by reading back issues of golf magazines? I don't think so. Knowledge is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Most any craft, profession or skill is learned by doing; those who burn out tend to do so long before their learning curve has delivered consistent results.<br /><br />This book is packed solid with information on methods of swing trading (I don't see how anyone can dispute that), and is a potentially useful volume for anyone who wants to brush up on TA techniques. The most hyped thing about this book is the title. It will not make you a `master' of anything... but it could increase your knowledge of the guts of swing trading and what the method is all about. Don't be dissuaded by the harsh sentiments of those who were looking for a holy grail or a pat on the back and didn't find it... but don't buy this book if that's what you are looking for either.

(Ironically, though, not until the third or fourth reading of each, after two or three years of having them on my shelf). But mostly I bought SMW because I wanted to read the interview with Mark Cook, an exceptional trader I had heard a fair bit about through the grapevine.<br /><br />Cook aside, my intuition told me this book would be a letdown overall... and that's exactly what it was in comparison to the first two. Being prepared for this tempered my disappointment, though, and allowed me to get more enjoyment out of the bright spots.<br /><br />Furthermore, after reading a few of the interviews a second (and third) time, I have to revise my earlier poor impression and give Schwager more credit. I am upgrading my initial assessment from mild disappointment to worthy and interesting read.<br /><br />A good measure of interview books is whether those being interviewed have unique and interesting things to say, or a fresh angle on a subject to give it a new or insightful perspective. I thought that Mark Minervini had some interesting commentary on why paper trading is a poor substitute for the real thing, and how skilled traders can use gut feel efficiently while novices have to fight it. John Bender's perspective on options pricing was fascinating, rooted in a common sense that most quants overlook. Stuart Walton was interesting because his psychological background was so refreshingly atypical, and Mark Cook just comes off as a candid, open and great guy all around. So, when all is said and done, Stock Market Wizards is still a step down but worth the time to read.<br /><br />Last but not least, at least two interesting thought paths developed after further reading of Stock Market Wizards.<br /><br />First, what are the psychological implications of the fact that so many successful traders blew out, or otherwise experienced severe financial pain, early in their careers? Is this some kind of necessary catharsis that leads to greater chances of success? If so, what are the deeper implications?<br /><br />Second, why is it a common theme of successful short term traders--who tend to be more consistent in their gains--that they have to \\"work on taking profits too quickly.\\" In other books too (Marty Schwartz from the first Market Wizards), taking profits too quickly is something short-term traders chide themselves for and say that they have to work on.<br /><br />But could this tendency to move \\"too quickly\\" somehow be a component of success? I think it is at least a possibility, because the thought of taking profits off the table (\\"making the cash register ring,\\" as Schwartz so aptly puts it) has been so vilified and rejected by the common wisdom that there may well be some value in it., early in their careers?

US	49345585	R2CDBWWCDU7JUU	0963579495	956932945	What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars	Books	3	61	68	N	N	Luck beats smarts but luck runs out	An alternative title to this book could be, \\"What I learned losing my ego.\\"<br /><br />After describing a meteoric rise to the top of the Chicago food chain, Jim Paul essentially boils down the secret of his success to being a cocky punk with an exceptional lucky streak that had to run out.<br /><br />I think he gives himself less credit than he deserves in ascribing all his early success to luck--it takes confidence and selling ability to take advantage of the \\"lucky breaks\\" he got--but that is beside the point. His main message is that success fed his ego until he felt that winning was his birthright. He thought he could do no wrong, which led to inevitable downfall.<br /><br />One small quibble. The ironic thing about Paul's stories of loss are that he was 99% there most of the time. If he hadn't have let the bean oil get back to zero, he could have walked away with at least a couple hundred grand in profits... if he hadn't let the stock options purchased for an eighth (or whatever it was) go to zero after seeing them hit $4, he could have had six figures in profit there again, etcetera.... I got the impression that even the big downfalls in this book were actually success stories with \\"oops\\" endings tacked on.<br /><br />In this light, I didn't really understand the blurbs on the back talking about how Jim Paul shows you the perils of the trading game. What perils? The perils of not taking a huge, monster profit when it is sitting in front of your face?<br /><br />This is why I have to think the book will probably just reinforce the ideas that readers already have when they pick it up. Someone with a big ego and a small mind could easily think in the back of his mind, \\"Nice story, Jim... good thing I won't make the same mistakes you made. Because while you just thought you were the man, I actually AM the man, heh heh...\\" But then again this isn't much of a criticism. I mean, who can reach those types anyway?<br /><br />The last half of the book reads almost like someone else wrote it, and has some very good points. I liked the way he took comments from a bunch of the \\"pros\\" (traders who have won big and kept their winnings) and juxtaposed their ideas, to show how successful traders' thought processes are sometimes totally different and often contradict each other.<br /><br />It really hammers home the point that there are multiple paths up the profit mountain, and that discipline and defense are often the only truly common elements among a broad universe of strategies. I also thought the book made a really great point about odds--hat the reward to risk ratio on a trade has nothing to do with actual probability of success for that trade.<br /><br />An entertaining book worth a weekend read.oints.

His credentials (10 consecutive years of 70%+ average returns) are top notch too. While those returns are well in the past now, as this book is a little dated, someone who is able to demonstrate ability that consistently can likely clean up in most any environment.<br /><br />His observations on treating trading like a business are golden. The three principles (I won't divulge them here because you really need to buy this book if you haven't read it), are elegant and to the point. They serve as the cornerstone of my trading philosophy and methodology.<br /><br />Sperandeo's explanation of trends is clear and succinct, and he cuts through many misconceptions of how to draw a trend line. His 1, 2, 3 method for determining a change in trend is simple and useful... so simple and useful, in fact, that it has been co-opted, doctored up and flogged to death by a certain cowboy-hatted commodity huckster. (Many of this huckster's faithful mistakenly think 123 tops and bottoms are his personal invention. Yeah right...).<br /><br />The 2B is a powerful and useful tool, but one that needs to be used judiciously and in line with the overall trend (from what I can see). Rather than calling a top in a market that is trending higher, I have found the 2B more useful for calling a mini-top in a market that has been in an overall downtrend, and is finishing up a short term upside correction--precisely the time that professionals are adding to their shorts. (The opposite of this example would go for a bottom-type 2B signal in an up-trending market.)<br /><br />To top it all off, this book contains a more lucid and understandable explanation of economics than you could get from most college professors, and a section on psychology and emotion that is right on the money.<br /><br />The only place where I would have a small disagreement with Sperandeo is that I think he perhaps displays the trend a little too concretely. Even when a trend is drawn correctly, if a new high or low comes in the trend has to be redrawn, so I would have stressed the fluidity of shorter term trends and the notion that they are much more general guidelines than hard reference points. But that's a small quibble with an overall knockout of a book.off, this book contains a more lucid and understandable explanation of economics than you could get from most college professors, and a section on psychology and emotion that is right on the money.

He also does a good job of going over the various technical theories with a straight face, neither endorsing favorites nor casting ridicule on the ones that are more logically suspect (ahem, cough, gann-elliott-fibonacci, cough cough).<br /><br />The only thing I really took issue with was Murphy's habit of trying to predict the size and extent of price moves, rather than sticking with more general observations regarding momentum and overall movement.<br /><br />Looking for something to happen before there is evidence of its arrival is a dangerous game for technical players, methinks. To devotees of the approach, a friendly warning -- be careful not to become a fundamentechnicalyst. Meaning, always keep in mind that effective technical analysis highlights probability rather than makes predictions.<br /><br />Since I just made up the word for this review, I'll now throw in the definition: A \\"fundamentechnicalyst\\" is one who makes predictions, just like the run of the mill fundamental analyst does... except the fundamentechnicalyst is making predictions based on technicals -- chart patterns and various indicators, rather than supply and demand, weather, politics, etcetera.<br /><br />In giving advance notice of how the movie is going to end, the approaches have similarity in their folly. The answer (in my opinion) is to not say, \\"aha! because of pattern ABC, result XYZ must now occur....\\"<br /><br />Instead, `tis better to say, \\"aha! because of pattern ABC, there is a favorable probability that XYZ could occur. But I recognize this is an odds game which means 1) it is normal, reasonable and expected for me to be wrong a portion of the time (the odds say so), and B) I must have a risk point, just in case this is \\"one of those occurrences\\" where the outcome falls against me.<br /><br />The difference in the thought process is subtle but critical. A hard prediction locks you in, creates a psychological commitment, brings your ego into the game, and threatens to screw up your mindset in general. Whereas if you recognize trading is essentially nothing but an odds game, then flexibility and peace of mind have a better shot of remaining intact.<br /><br />One of the hidden gems of this book was an excellent outline of why the contrarian method works. I don't want to give away Murphy's goods here, so I will just say that he points out a few very interesting reasons why it is natural for the majority to be wrong at turning points, and it is not simply because the masses lack trading ability or intelligence (though that is a factor, of course; the lumbering beast called Crowd is known for strong back and weak mind.)<br /><br />To sum up, buy this book if you are new to technicals, if you want to brush up on your knowledge, or if you just want a handy reference. But be wary of the prediction trap. Keep your understanding of probability and odds intact.chological commitment, brings your ego into the game, and threatens to screw up your mindset in general.

US	49345585	R26OMSFQGMKBS1	0786311916	404935494	Winner Take All	Books	3	24	25	N	N	An entertaining polemic	When a book bills itself as \\"brutally honest,\\" you are usually in for some interesting reading. Gallacher wastes no time in taking on a moral tone, exposing the idiocy of emotional basket cases (who shouldn't be in the markets in the first place) and commodity broker crooks who add no value to the process (and are good at nothing other than fast talk and sales techniques).<br /><br />While these opening observations are based on truth-seeded stereotypes, they don't seem all that necessary. Do we really need to hear that there are a lot of sad sacks in the markets who shouldn't be trading, or that there a lot of dishonest / incompetent brokers out there? Maybe I am off base to assume this is common knowledge.<br /><br />The book is at its most interesting in uncovering the fallacy behind some highly esteemed mythical legends. Elliott, Gann and Fibonacci, when it comes down to it, appear to have little substance behind their methods, and Gallacher does a thorough job of exposing that fact. He also shines some sunlight on the seemingly ubiquitous (at the time of this writing) Larry Williams, aggressively painting him as a fraud.<br /><br />Gallacher is neither totally wrong nor totally right in his methodical destruction of technical analysis. What he overlooks is that fundamental analysts and many technical analysts actually have a similar problem: attempts to profit from predicting the future frequently prove futile because the higher the probability that you are right, the lower the probability that you can make money off that knowledge before others do.<br /><br />The best way to use technical analysis (in this reviewer's opinion) is not to try to predict the future, but only to measure probabilities of an event occurring, and then to place bets when probability assessment shows conditions to be favorable. That is to say, if event A happens under certain conditions, then the probability of profitable scenario B occurring, while still uncertain, may have increased enough to make the trade a worthwhile risk. Many chart patterns only follow through 50% of the time (or less), but can still be used profitably via proper understanding of reward to risk.<br /><br />This basic understanding--that trading is a game of probabilities in which it is impossible to win every time--is why good traders aren't bothered by routine losses. When Gallacher says \\"deliberately preparing for a loss is perverse, pessimistic, unnatural, yet correct,\\" he shows that he has a personal stake in being right, and does not fully understand that trading is above all an odds game. (Is it \\"perverse\\" or \\"pessimistic\\" for a poker player to expect not to win every hand?)<br /><br />Gallacher says \\"All the big winning plays I have seen in the market can be traced to a correct call on economic fundamentals.\\" He must not read much. Take Richard Dennis, for example, who turned a few hundred bucks into hundreds of millions with no fundamental input, or Marty Schwartz, who was a failure as a fundamental analyst for 9 years but became one of the most consistently profitable traders of all time after making the switch to TA, or Ed Seykota, who turned $5,000 into $15,000,000 with a purely mechanical system.... and so on.<br /><br />Last of all, Gallacher leans on technical analysis himself near the end of the book. If he were a true fundamentalist, he would continue holding a position that was going against him until he was convinced that the fundamentals have changed. If the fundamentals haven't changed as you know them, and you get out of a market only because the price is moving sharply the wrong way against you... then guess what, you're using a form of technical analysis whether you meant to or not!<br /><br />In conclusion, I have to say that most of Gallacher's beef with technical analysis is a straw man. He actually attacks the poor habits (overtrading, risking too much on a trade, not taking losses etc.) that are the hallmarks of bad trading in general, not technical analysis as a method.<br /><br />An entertaining book, with some good food for thought, but one in which emotion was given a little too much free reign.ood food for thought, but one in which emotion was given a little too much free reign.	2001-04-24

(In other words, tough to grasp.) Schwager, an extremely intelligent and successful analyst, is something of a quant... the type of individual who enjoys crunching long series of numbers, sifting through data with a fine toothed comb, and finding hidden statistical correlations for their own sake. His writing style reflects this mindset.<br /><br />While informative overall, Schwager at times tackles subjects of mind-numbing complexity and strays into the realm of the pedantic. (His example of how to fundamentally analyze the hog market is such a case.) I was amazed at the level of esoterica delved into in certain places in this book. After reading this book early on (a trader interviewed in Market Wizards recommended it highly), I was worried that I might have to learn some high level calculus if I were going to be a successful trader. (Don't worry, that's not the case.)<br /><br />One of the things the successful trader has to do is learn to separate valuable information from noise, wheat from chaff. If you try to read every report and analyze every detail you come across, you will freeze like a deer in the headlights... or otherwise find yourself buried by an information avalanche.<br /><br />My overall impression is that Schwager approaches markets the way a mathematics professor would approach a particularly thorny problem: with logic, rigor and a visible lack of passion. His strengths are in crunching the numbers and laying out basic facts and theories with precision and clarity. His weakness, and thus the weakness of this book in my opinion, is in poorly communicating the psychological and emotional elements of trading.<br /><br />This is not to say the book has no value. It is packed with information, and also points out a number of the fallacies committed by traders (skilled and unskilled alike). It is a good reference book to have, something like an abridged encyclopedia of trading, one that can be referred to many times over to brush up on the finer points of a certain strategy or technical method.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those seeking quantitative knowledge of the futures markets and mathematical breakdowns of the strategies. But if you buy and read this book, be aware that not all traders are so statistical and professor-like in their analysis.<br /><br />Schwager humbly admits that he is not a good trader himself. I suspect this is because he tries to hide behind rigorous analysis rather than dealing with his emotions and psychology directly, and this book reflects some of that attempt. In conclusion I would say that this is an excellent reference guide, but cannot agree that it is \\"complete\\" because it glosses over the critical psychological and emotional elements.many times over to brush up on the finer points of a certain strategy or technical method.

It has been noted, quite sadly but correctly, that the main use of the field of economics is to employ economists. Most standard economic theory is nonsense, because it is based on the idea that man acts 100% rationally at all times and always considers the action with the highest utility function.<br /><br />The majority of economists are embarrassed to admit their work is closer to sociology than mathematics, and so they try to fudge it by making their work LOOK like mathematics as much as they can. In a desperate bid for legitimacy, they apply so many formulas and calculations that the result looks like the scribblings of an idiot savant on a blackboard (and carries about as much meaning).<br /><br />Standard economic theory (as taught in universities) might work if people were soulless robots who acted with the precision and predictability of computer programs. But they are not and do not. Clearly standard economics as commonly taught has failed... as most politicians, most of the general public, and even many CEOs do not understand the basic function of price and the implications of supply and demand in a free market economy.<br /><br />This book lays it all out clearly, with no mumbo jumbo and no vapid theories that are dependent on retrofitted curves or laughable variables to try and look impressive. Mr. Sowell speaks plainly, conveying simple concepts that ivy league professors find themselves at a loss to understand (how else to explain a lingering taste for socialist policies?).<br /><br />If you want to understand how economics works without the ivory tower hype, buy this book. If I had my way this book would be required reading for every politician, and they would have to demonstrate an understanding of its contents before uttering word one about taxes, or profits, or moral obligations of business, or anything else related to the economy.	2001-03-13

A lot of Douglas' theory I find silly (his pseudo-philosophy on how thoughts are energy etcetera), but the stuff he gets right makes up for that many times over.<br /><br />One of the keys to successful trading is recognizing that the market is not necessarily a combatant. It does not have to be a bloodstained arena, a boxing ring, a firefight, or even a physical thing. Ttrading in the Zone helped me to realize this, and further to realize that viewing the markets as a battle or a conflict or a place of adversity was not necessarily optimal for my personal psychology.<br /><br />Douglas also points out a pitfall of many traders--the need not just to make money, but to be right. After expanding on this seed of thought, I have come to the conclusion that many traders who think they are in the markets to make money are actually in it for something else. He is correct in pointing out how the standard-issue coping methods for everyday life can have disastrous result in markets.<br /><br />This book also helped me confirm something I have always suspected. In a key sense, trading should be easy. This is to say, the journey is hard and grueling, but once you get there, the sense of conflict and adversity should dissipate. Lance Armstrong worked his fingers to the bone, but when he was leading the pack in the Tour De France I imagine he was experiencing a sense of joy and focus, not conflict or persecution or fear. Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods likely sweat and groan and grind themselves down in practice, but in actual application their performance is conducted in an easy, flowing, almost dreamlike state.<br /><br />If you want to reach that state of inner calm, Trading in the Zone may help you achieve it. If you think this is a silly ideal and want to keep fighting and sweating and screaming at your screen, great--don't be surprised to find some calmer soul taking your money at some point.silly ideal and want to keep fighting and sweating and screaming at your screen, great--don't be surprised to find some calmer soul taking your money at some point.	2001-03-05

A chart is almost a visual snapshot of crowd psychology (greed and fear) graphically represented.<br /><br />This book explains how candlesticks take reading crowd psychology to the next level. Not only does Nison teach recognition of the important patterns, he explains the psychological motivation behind those patterns... the emotions and sentiments unfolding as those patterns are created.<br /><br />It has been my experience that candlesticks are most effective at giving advance warning of a reversing or flatlining trend--thus I apply the patterns more to my exits than my entries. But I take information from candlesticks on a regular basis regardless.<br /><br />Just as an example, if you look at a bar chart, you can't really tell which of those bars were up closes and which were down closes unless you look extremely closely. With candlesticks you get this info at a glance, adding to an intuitive feel for price movement that can enhance profitability. You also get more specific and accurate signals, with minimal distraction in terms of information bloat. There's just no comparison.<br /><br />I wouldn't trade without candlestick charts any more readily than I would without streaming quotes. They simply provide another dimension to market action that bar charts miss. Nison's book offers entry and grounding into this world.	2000-08-30

I was loosely familiar with most of the concepts presented in this book, but after I read it I came away with a much deeper understanding.<br /><br />Psychological preparation for trading is, in a way, like martial arts training. Focus and discipline are in the training; during the actual act of trading the mind is often clear and blank. The key is to prepare so that when the time comes to act quickly (as happens often in futures trading), you can let your intuition and subconscious take over without fear of being led astray by false beliefs.<br /><br />If you are comfortable with your trading psychology and have the discipline to follow your methodology without fail, you probably don't need this book. But if you still struggle with issues of discipline and / or mental blocks (as a majority of traders do), then the insights here may very well be worth the price.	2000-08-02
