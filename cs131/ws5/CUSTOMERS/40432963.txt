One thing about this author: he can be amusing, wicked, and pedagogic at the same time, and he spouts forth words almost like a non-extinct volcano. How does he do it?! Here he mildly critiques such academic, rambling authors like Iris Murdoch, while writing in awe of the legendary literary busyness of John Updike. His appreciation of Bellow for his non stop exuberance, and Nabokov for his extreme wordplay may be overdone, but nonetheless well worth the read. The best pieces may be of Anthony Burgess, the rollicking, phantasmagorical Brit, especially his review of the Burgess autobiography. He admits Joyce's ULYSSES is not a \\"straight thru\\" read, a comment which perfectly matches my thoughts, but plows thru this hefty tome with great style and aplomb! In fact, the fun and amusement prac tically never cease here, as in most of Mr. Amis's now hefy oeuvre. So reading through this book bit by bit is an enjoyable romp, a fun and stimulating way to make it through the night!	2005-10-13
US	40432963	RF5MY7UIN2BU1	0375724842	119489429	Harm Done: An Inspector Wexford Mystery	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Not RR's Best, but still Mostly Excellent!!!	I admit that this author is one of the very few whom I have finished every book by her that I started, no small achievement! As a  \\"non mystery\\" examining the lifestyles of the rich and poor in current England, it is a wonderful multi-layered book covering social problems like wife and child abuse, disappearing young ladies, mob psychology, pedophiles, and lots more. The descriptions and interactions between all the actors here are right up to top of RR's books. Some of it is beautifully written, and flows along wonderfully. However, this novel does not supply the usual amount of creeping menace that really makes RR among the top in her field. So, since this is a slightly flawed mystery with all the elements of literary razzle dazzle usually associated with the author, it may not be among her very best. Plus the ultimate resolution seems a bit stilted, if not downright unrealistic. Nonetheless, another outstanding journey thru contempoary English society, with the police procedural angle not quite up to her best. In other words, this would be \\"5 Stars\\" for about anyone else, but not quite for this top drawer author!	2005-10-07

There is enough hate in this book towards the French, Russians, Communists, Socialists, Germans (many,but definitely not all), the Hapsburgs, and especially those who (as the dictator writes) cannot hate their enemies enough. Obviously the Jews get special treatment,and it gets as ugly as you think. The freemasons and other smaller organizations get their share too. But all that is no surprise. The early life story in his own words of this \\"ferocious genius\\" (as Churchill said) is certainly worth the price of the book, and most ofthe first part covers his days in the Great War, and in Vienna, with descriptions of this beautiful yet unforgiving and nasty metropolis just before and after the war, and his rabble-rousing in the army and in Munich from 1919-1923, when the book was written. He is obviously disease obsessed, part of the beginnings of his vicious anti-semitism, since he blames the Jews for spreading Syphilis. Obviously he is very well read on history, art, music, and architechiture, and in some passages, this book is astounding!. But as a record of some very lucid and very sick ideas from a genius/madman, this book is surely in  a league of its own!	2005-10-01

From the first few pages of this book, we know we are reading a master who knows the facts in Afghanistan and the smaller new nations just north of it , and south of Russia. Every yarn is unique, some with tons of black humor, others placing you right inside the Afghan war. The first tells of a journalist trying his best to get some penicillin for his malaria sticken pal, including risking his life in a mad rush near the battlesgrounds, to a supposed plant/field that can kill the disease. The end is shocking, and horrific. In \\"The Ambassador's Son\\" we are inside the wild west flavor of a new \\"Istan\\" nation,including some of the zaniest writing imaginable. To compare this author with Hemingway, Kiplang, and Greene is indeed not a stretch. In fact, I even prefer this short collection to many of the past \\"Classics\\" of foreign intrigue and war.	2005-10-01

Needless to say, my favorites were the ones set in or near Zongo Street, in the West African nation of Ghana (formerly Gold Coast). Here we meet a bizarre assortment of thieves, prophets, bullies, tea store owners and their overweight wives,taxi drivers, ghost masquesaders, and many others, including many not much different than you and me. All these tales are beautifully done and just about perfect, and there is some of the zaniest humor you will ever encounter.

The two authors are among p formulaic esoteric thriller writers out there, and keep the action and amusement in top form throughout! As always, the NYC scenes and descriptions are top notch, along with the computer info, and museum topics. However, the characters are too simple and standard. And the main plot, the FBI man's very strange, indeed maniacal brother's truly sickening escapades,seem totally unbelievable, if not surreal. And all the disguises, and escapes are not really convincing. Still, a fine read for just about all ages, and all in all, a pretty strong showing in the Pendergast saga, which is obviously continuing, as noted in the vague ending.	2005-09-26

A very fun and appetizing read about serious skullduggery at Midwestern U near Chicago, seemingly a take off on Northwestern, where the author teaches. Here we have some very amusing English Dept academics, including a somewhat bitter man-hater, several interesting profs, and the lady professor who really loves Dickens. When a student is karate-chopped in the lady's room, the FBI gets involved with more than book thefts and plagiarism. What struck me was that the FBI did not check the background of the suspects to determine who may have attended karate school in the past, maybe a small quibble but one hopes in real life the FBI would check this out! After the second murder, the situaton gets truly intense, though one feels it should have gotten intense after the first. Still, a top drawer mystery with enough academia, literary allusions, Chicago landmarks, fun, and mystery to keep any reader on his toes, even if the solution seemed a stretch!	2005-09-23

This bio does a fine job in analyzing and comparing the great scientist's personal and family life, with his famous scientific research, writing, and early Beagle Explorations. Apparently, he had serious health problems, most in the digestive system, but overcame this adversity, among others, to write some of the greatest scientific documents ever. Of his ten children, three died young, including two as infants. His financial independence certainly helped matters, but the long and involved writing and research would probably have discouraged a lesser man. Truly well done thruout, and not overbearingly difficult for the scientific and biological layman, like this reviewer!	2005-09-22

About 9 months ago, 63 million voters re-elected GW Bush & Co. The sales pitch was \\"keeping the homeland safe\\".   What have we seen so far?! An inept foreign war \\"Shock and Awe\\" started 100% on lies and deception, tens of thousands dead, our international image shattered, and a great recruiting ground for present and future terrorists!. Huge tax cuts for those who need it least. A chest thumping group of incompetents totally clueless in managing a catastrophic hurricane and flood,despite the lessons of 9/ll and the recent Tsumami. The same group cut back by about 80% Flood/Levee Protection for the Great (Former) City of New Orleans, one of America's true gems, and eliminated the wet lands program to hold back flood waters, selling whatever pieces they could to developers,and a president whose now infamous comments \\"No one ever thought the levees would breach\\" shows the true mindset of this administration! All the while they were cutting back on levee work, hundreds of millions of $ went to Halliburton to help clean up the mess we made in Iraq!! Result: Total lack of preparation for this disaster, thousands and thousands of dead and homeless US citizens, and the great CITY OF NEW ORLEANS DROWNED!! An administration without even the slightest sense of shame or honor. No, this is truly the most APPALLING PRESIDENCY IN US HISTORY. No one else comes close!!!	2005-09-08

What a fine book and bio! The author stated that he is most interested in placing TH Huxley into the context of his times, late 19th Century England, and the world, and he succeeds completely! From THH's humble origins with descriptions of the slums of 1840's London, through the amazing Rattlesnake voyage to Australia and New Guinea, and onward to the world's #1 Iconoclast (Nietzsche came a little later), this book reads like the best novel, with tons of biology, paleontology,history of science, theological debunking, and English history all included. Not to mention the sometimes difficult financial and family life of the founder of the famous 20th century Huxleys. THH was obvious as close to a universal scientific  genius and spokeman as we'll ever have! Very strange how his many claims for science in school were accepted in Britain by the 1890's, but are still controversial in 2000's USA!	2005-09-07

This selection of HLM aphorisms appeared in his later years at the age of 68, just before his health seriously deteriorated. Basically a book of about 432 short witticisms, much like A. Bierce's DEVIL'S DICTIONARY, but with a bit too much bile a times. Obviously, he enjoys jabbing at the powerful (\\"Roosevelt II\\", among others), the New Deal, Lawyers, Politicians, Professors, just about everyone, or, all the hippocrites, idiots,morons,(standard words in the HLM lexicon)  out there. Politically he seems to subscribe to the hard Victorian \\"Sink or Swim\\" philosophy, and constantly cracks those who cannot pull their own weight. Democracy? A sham for losers and loafers. Elections? Only those who have supported themselves for 5 years need apply. Mississippians and Tenneseeans? Mainly dim wits and holy rollers of inferior stock. Some of these comments get repetitive, and more than a little tasteless. But,still, at his best, he is incomparable, especially in critiqueing organized (mainly Christian) religion. In his view a total sham, completely irrational and unscientific. In fact, the world would be vastly improved if everyone took a few moments to consider his irreverent, but totally honest, religion comments.Wars? Completely without morals and really a suckers game run by incompetents with no knowledge of the horrors being unleached. So today HLM would be a far right libertarian, but would shoot his poisonous darts to all the war mongerers and phoney flag wavers. So where is today's HLM? There are a few who try, but none who can come close!	2005-08-20

US history is about 50% of the book, and there is not too much \\"US -centrism\\", as one might expect.Drawbacks include overdone pieces on entertainment personages like Elvis and Marilyn, not to mention a lot on US Consumer culture, especially since the 1950's. There are nice sections on \\"Levittowns\\", the A-Bombs, the McCarthy era,Chambers-Hiss, the Cuba Missle Crisis, Civil Rights into the present day.Even better is that WW2 coverage includes the war from the German and especially the Russian viewpoints, including an outstanding section on the siege of Leningrad, including a photo of a dead mother held by her (living)child. The Russian effort in WW2 is too often downplayed in US based histories. Also a fine section on the Chinese Revolution and Korean War. In fact,as an intro, this about as good as it gets, either for the student, or as a capsule for the amateur/armchair historian. Definitely a keeper,with great photos, and timeless as well!	2005-08-18

This book tears away all the neat and prissy excuses that are often made about the \\"War on Terror\\". First, and most importantly, the extreme Jihadists do not hate us for our \\"liberties, way of life, democracy\\" but for our \\"actions\\". Simple enough. And he lists the 6 reasons , noted in other reviews. So, apparently the author thinks we have in part brought this problem to ourselves, and are now dealing with the \\"Payback\\". This is a religious war against radical Islam, something else the powers that be seem vague to acknowledge. And Bin Ladin is figure of charisma, even repsect, whose attacks on the # 1 enemy, USA, are applauded by millions throughout the world. Instead of an immediate, huge assault assault,we dilly dallied for 3 weeks after 9/11, thereby allowing bin ladin etc to escape. As for the Iraq War, Anonymous pulls no punches! A heavenly gift to Al Quada for obvious reasons, in short a catastrophe! No news there! He says there were probably 400,000 armed ex Iraqi soldiers hiding out, seeking revenge (\\"revenge\\"- an idea seemingly not contemplated by the US powers that be). And we should use overwhelming force against them! Maybe, but even Anonynous does not seem to think that many of them were simply defending their land, country, faith, families, etc. Overwhelming force by the author also means not worrying about USA casualties since this is a WAR, not a police action. He wisely quotes Washington and John Quincy Adams about chasing foreign \\"monsters\\" in the Iraq war context. Also, he seems to suggest that current Islamic religious wars, and their leaders (in this case Jihadists) have traits similar to Crusading Catholic saints of old,stating his Catholic background. A very strange comment, to say the least!	2005-08-17

Among the top \\"100 People\\" are Ted Kennedy,Al Gore,John Edwards, Robert Bryd, and Howard Dean. Last time I checked, none of these people were showing gross incompetence, after after lied their way into a war. In fact, the latter two were all too correct as to the consequences of this 2 1/2 year Iraq disaster..(1) tens of thousands of dead and maimed Iraqis, (2)about 15,000 dead and maimed US soldiers,(2) a recruiter's dream for Al Quada and other terrorists. Seemingly, our leaders did not think that some relatives, friends, etc. might not be too pleased at their unnecessary demise, and might actually start an anti US insurrection.Also, none of the above proclaimed \\"Mission Accomplished\\" or \\"Bring 'em On\\" over two years ago. Clearly, that easily meets the criterion of \\"screwing up America\\". The erroneous comments  of two US authors (Smiley and Mailer), who have a vastly superior oeurve to the author, do not mean that they are \\"screwing up\\" America. Some difficult decisions by the President of Columbia U. also do not seem to meet this standard..However, the author is 100% correct in naming some of the major sources of US JunkCulture, and for this he deserves some slight positive encouragement (two, instead of one star). However, as is typical among the Reactionary Right, there is no acknowlegement of a leading 1980's JunkCulture Rep;i.e. the current governor (Republican) who made his millions as the #1 portrayer of SciFi Robotic mass murder.	2005-08-15

No doubt Mencken was a world class curmudgeon! Also among the funniest, most insightful, and brilliant writers ever to adorn a pen! This is his classic collection, pieces sure to shock, anger, amuse, or simply be dazzled by his amazing mind. How many current journalists would be so bold as to say that priests are \\"sorcerers\\", and to list about 30 gods who were big time eons ago, but now forgotten! Henry's sharp darts could piece any \\"Bounder\\" or \\"Dunderhead\\", especially those with hypocritical tendencies. Writing in the 1920's , he was not impressed by the South, stating that the pre-Civil War aristocracy was about all gone, to be replaced by..well, you can read to find out. He was not a fan of the New Deal, and his 1934 article compares it with France in 1847. Maybe not quite on the mark, but still insightful and funny! There may be those who consider him a true misanthrope, but this is disproven by his eloquent and elegant comments on the great, especially Twain, Beethoven, and Franz Schubert, who receives about the highest praise possible. This is one book that will never be old or dated, and always worth some serious reading and browsing!	2005-08-08

First off, this is an easy ,breezey, and quick read that covers a lot of the problems of the current administration. The comparisons with the Nixon Administration are interesting, but frankly not really accurate since the GWB Admin. is far worse for several reason, mainly lying, deception, twisting the facts for invading a nation with \\"Shock and Awe.\\" By now, the results of this policy have shown what a complete disaster the Iraqi war has been. Not only in lives lost, including about 25,000-plus innocent Iraqis who are never mentioned by the GWB Adminstration ,or the US/Coalition Dead/Maimed, but the fact that we are creating new enemies, a fact the powers that be were/are totally oblivious to. C. Powell's UN speech is noted for the absolutely brazen fraud that it is/was. Needless to say no one in the current adminstration has a thing to say about this! Also the Plame/Wilson situation is mentioned here in some detail, interesting since the book was published over a year ago. The comments on Cheney's health, or Bush's prior career, are all an interesting sideline. Very well done by a person who knows what he's talking about!	2005-07-25

This is a very atmospheric, slightly dense procedural, with twists and turns that go through Tokyo, the war, Osaka, several villages, and the Japanese Rail system. Not to mention a Magrait-like inspector with all his family and middle aged concerns. The cast of characters includes some 20-something nouveau artists/ musicians, a wise elderly abacas maker, and a victim, at first unknown, but who is described as saint-like by all who knew him. Not to mention a look at Japanese society, one so polite that everyone says \\"Welcome\\", even to the police; where it is normal to bow, and where please and thank you are seemingly obligatory. Interestingly, almost no one looses his temper, and even arrests are made as discretely and politely as possible. A very fine and different police tale!	2005-07-25

A frustrated American author meets and marries an English lady, they move into the English countryside so he can write and think, and their marriage gradually dissolves into sarsastic quips, and trivial complaints. Though this is definitely not new, Hightsmith twists this faltering marriage into a nasty game of hide and seek, where the wife takes an extended disappearing act into Brighton, and her folks call the police to investigate. Meanwhile, frustrated write-hubby daydreams and sometimes tells his friends how he may have done away with her. In a wonderfully  set English landscape, this seeming innocent situation slowly turns frightening, with  a fine cast of characters, including the elderly widow,new next door neighbor. For sheer everyday creepiness, Highsmith is in  a class of her own in this non-Ripley mesmorizer.	2005-07-23

For me, just about any Brit mystery/ procedural is worthwhile, and I was not disappointed here. The story's many subplots may not always fit perfectly together, but they add historic and bibliophile interest. When a hand is delivered in a pizza box to the Bath police murder squad, it is determined to be about 15-20 years old, and probably the result of harm done during some excavating and building in an old vault near a cemetary, and also very near the spot where Mary Shelley may have written Frankenstein. An American professor-tourist discovers an old book that may also have belonged to Mrs. Shelley 180 years ago.Meanwhile, some interesting art that may be unknown Blakes also make the rounds. A very readable, interesting, and page-turning plot is woven around this, plus Inspector Diamond's investigations. We meet some eccentric Brits, including a middle ages puppeteer, some greedy antiques dealers, and a severely beaten police officer, plus a body in the nearby river. Though Diamond may not be the jolliest or most lovable detective, there's enough clues and action to keep the serious mystery buff page turning. The solution and ending are not quite up to speed, and a slight disappointment, but still a near top notch modern Brit mystery.	2005-07-23

If you want to know the real horrors of a  theocracy, then read this book! Though the book covers many areas, including exploration, great art, and everyday life, the real subject here is the incredible nastiness of so much 15th-16th century Christianity, culminating in horrors of beheading or burning \\"heretics\\", torturing of scientists,debaucheries even beyond those so well advertised in the present era, and tons more. Calvin's Church-State in Geneva was apparently as depraved as their Catholic enemies in Rome, etc. The story of Luther is among the best I've encountered, not to mention the Renaissance popes. This book is a great read, by one of our finest popular historians, and though it's subject is somewhat unusual for the late great Mr. Manchester, the notes and research amply give proof to his text!	2005-07-20

First off, this reviewer is not convinced of the existence of any supernatural being in outer space/heaven or anywhere for that matter. Regardless, this is an exploration of the inner and outer life of Barabbas, the condemned man who was replaced at Golgotha by Jesus. This is a beautifully written story that I read in about two hours. We tour life in Jerusalem, meet individuals who ring true to the place and times, and explore underground mines where slaves never escaped, except in  a few very lucky cases. Many of spiritual ideas of the time are explained as well. And the fire in Rome is well done too. So for a fine ride through the Christian and non-Christian world of about 1960 years ago, and an exploration of the roots and meaning of religion, this book is a very fine start!	2005-07-16

If you like the Ripley series, this one is very similar, though the oddball chemical engineer obsessed in an unrequited affair is not nearly as sick as Ripley, and in fact may not really be a criminal at all, except for his posing under a fictitious name, another Ripley trait. Set in late 1950's Hudson Valley, NY, with short scenes in Hartford and LaJolla,Ca., one is still amazed at the incredible deviousness which this author specialized in. Also, the slow deterioration of a near genius, very successful young engineer absolutely obsessed by his ex girlfriend, who politely rejects him, but who won't give up his obsessive pursuit. Well worth reading, though maybe not Highsmith at her absolute pathological best.	2005-07-15

The narration/ point of view in this novel is really exceptional as it all takes place in the mind of a supposedly upstanding Aussie citizen, owner of a family stationary business, men's clubbite, and ravenous consumer of all and any facts, especially odd reproductive habits of plants and animals, not exempting the human species. There is so much dark and wry humor in this 1st person narrative that I was laughing almost against my better instincts thruout. Every scene is near perfect from the awkward courtship ceremonies of our slowing maddening hero, through the visits to brothels, business practices, and family life/marriage through to the bitter end.For a truly unique perspective into the mind of a very depraved man, this one is hard to beat.

The Great Philosopher certainly does not pull any punches! This is an assault on sanctimonious hypocrisy, make believe,  ignorance, and the never ending peddling of superstition and myth by the few who reap the rewards of earthly rewards and wealth through their power over the weak, the illiterate and the credulous. Nietzsche proudly proclaims that ideas like faith, redemption, heaven, hell are all non provable cant, not fit for the mind of any thinking and rational person. Some of his Gospel quotes appear to prove his point. Intolerance and hatred have arisen along with love and charity, and Nietzsche, for all his ranting, makes his points as clear as day. This may be a bruising read for some, especially the unquestioning and close-minded, but if you can make it through this short tirade, you may find it difficult not to agree with many of the basis ideas here.	2005-07-01

Any and all miracles are refuted as exaggerations or simply stories, often superstitions or myths similar to many others, believed by a mostly ignorant, illiterate populace looking something to alleviate all the miseries of living on earth. Comparing the 4 gospels and St. Paul's writings with Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Zorastrian,etc. myths, the author places then in historical context. This book is definitely an examination of all Christian apologists, and is just as relevent today as when it was written.	2005-06-26

The negative reviews here are a surprise, given that \\"A Theft\\", one of Mr. Bellow's later short books, is a very fine portrait of contemporary NYC, viewed from an a much married Lady Fashion Mag Exec mother of 3 daughters, who has recently hired an Austrian Au Pair. The young Viennese becomes almost a fourth daughter until the title \\"Theft\\" leaves many questions for many of the characters to answer. Simply put, a beautifully done, realistic tale without some of the author's often overdone intellectualizing and denseness. So if you're new to Saul Bellow, this may be as good a place as any to start.	2005-06-24

Here we have a mostly fine story of a UK policeman stuck in a bad marriage, investigating a gruesome murder, with the naked body found dumped in a high rise apartment. Most of the investigation aspects are very well done, and there is enough outstanding and amusing dialogue to keep the pages turning. Also, some nice comments on European smuggling, and antique violins and bows. Slider's fling with the victim's chair partner is way overdone, and as in many current thrillers, apparently no one even considers that some of the suspects may be on the killer's future list, including the detective. A good editing job should have made this a really top notch procedural, but it is still mostly worth while. And lastly, it does give an interesting perspective on contemporary British society. As a first in a new series, this is a most noteworthy  debut.	2005-06-23

Having plowed through tons of books on WSC, I found this one among the brightest, breeziest, most entertaining of all! Not at all \\"heavy\\", or dense, it is a fine introduction, or a nice \\"wrapping up\\" for the WSC buff, like myself. It covers just about all the basics, mentioning his family , children (one who died at age 2), young school days,early life heroics, his controversies, like Dardanelles (but omits the Labor Riots and Norway fiascoes). Often , 2 sides of the stories are shown, like \\"Was he an alcoholic?\\", \\"Was he a Good Family Man/Father/Hubbie?\\" Even his public crying is described, and theres is even a question/answer section at the back! In the end, the author suggests that despite his huge flaws, inability to listen, etc., his awesome reputation is truly deserved! Tough to argue with that!	2005-06-20

This very short group of essays is profound, amusing, and a definite page turner. Voltaire reminds me of an 18th century French version of our early 20th century HL Mencken. He is obviously a twinkling eyed commentator, often tongue in cheek, but always right on the mark. The pieces on Quakerism and English religion are entertaining and thoughtful, as it is obvious that Voltaire was not easily duped by anyone or anything. He appreciates the English method of innoculation against smallpox, and wishes his fellow Frenchmen would follow this course. And his appreciation for the philosophers/ scientists Locke and Newton is unbounded. So if you run across this short piece, take an evening to read it through!	2005-06-18

One can only wonder why this truly outstanding memoir is long out of print! Growing up in Brooklyn, and graduating to the high brow circles of Columbia and the Village, the author writes a fabulous tale of his encounters and friendships with many of the very famous literati of the 1920's. Moving to the Paris in the early 1920's, he carouses with some of the nihilistic Dadaists, later Surrealists, and has great stories to tell thruout. Attempting to start a new literary magazine,\\"Broom\\", he meets with modest success,but travels through France and Germany, meeting some of the most eccentric people you'll ever hear of! He even takes time to work as a customer's man trading stocks in the high flying mid 1920's Wall Street scene by day, resuming his literary adventures by evening. Later, he tells us of about writing a biography of Zola, traveling through major Midwest cities,especially Chicago, to explore them from top to bottom. And in 1930, he barely survives a fire in his NYC apartment building..All in all, too good to review in only a short paragraph!	2005-06-15

Here we have a terrifically lucid, readable, and even entertaining account that truly does answer the question, how such a seeming loser from nowhere could rise to become the undisputed leader of the German Nazi party. The tragic and horrible conditions in Germany between 1918-1924 are described in haunting detail, the economy a wreck with inflation reaching 1 billion% by the time of the Novemeber, 1923 Putsch. The cast of characters includes the mesmorizing speaker Hitler, plus the weird general Ludendorrf, Rohm, Hess, the Strassers, Drexler, Goring, and many others, including the WC Fields-like Putzi Hafstaengel, who kept contact with foreign journalists. And the actual events of the BeerHall Putsch have their horrid moments plus some Keystone Kops moments too! In short, about the best early Nazi history out there!	2005-06-10

In attempting to answer the source of Hitler's evil, this book begins with discussing the rumor factories that surrounded him from the very beginning, and this is frankly a rehash of about all the stories (some maybe true, some not, who knows) in constant circulation (mentioned in the amazon reviews here).But the section on the MUNICH POST and this paper's constant assault on the \\"Hitler Party\\", even listing street political murders on a near daily basis is the one new thing (to me) in the book. Barely mentioned are previous historical \\"Lebensraums\\" including Russia in Siberia, and the 400 year exploration and populating of the the New World, not to mention European colonizations in Africa. Hitler was a big reader of Karl May's cowboy and Indian stories even in his days as Fuehrer. The centuries old assualt by the Christion religion on the Jews is also discussed. This is surely an overlooked aspect of earlier huge anti-Semitic movements. Also hardly noted is Hitler's fear of \\"poisoned blood\\" and a \\"diseased race\\" which he mentions in MEIN KAMPF. It seems that practically all the scholars feel that their idea is about the only one, when truth to tell, there is probably some truth to about all the theories which can help explain Hitler.	2005-05-28

Though definitely far from perfect, Mr. Vidal's wry comments, and sharp eye for nitwits and blather, always make for entertaining, and thought provoking reading! He has some nice things to say about Charles Linbergh, and even praises much of the politics and courage of the #1 Crooner, Frank Sinatra,(at least during Frank's early progressive days). Gore may be a bit harsh on Mr. Updike, calling him about the only pro-Vietnam War author out there, and someone who near blindly goes along with the politicians on war and peace. His assault on Updike's novel \\"In the Field of the Lilies\\" is definitely over the top. (I though it was a fine book!). He has nothing good to say about Pres. Truman, in Mr. Vidal's opinion the founder of the National Security State, and his comments on 1954 Guatemala are truly a revelation! His tales about Clare Luce and his ambivalence about FDR also provide amusement and some serious thought. And when he learns 47 years later that none other than Thomas Mann was reading his early book CITY AND PILLAR, he is most pleased, to say the least! Even if one does not always agree with Mr. Vidal, he always provides more than money's worth of hilarity and provocation!	2005-05-28

The good news here is that is really a finely written book, with excellent commentary on the life and times of the tragic kidnapping and murder. The cast of characters is huge, and the author seems to bring in about anyone even remotely associated with the events. \\"JJ\\" the fraud, embezzler, secret agent, FBI con man;Hauptmann himself, who seems totally innocent and tells a great story even to the governor;Governor Hoffman, who feels there is a lot more to the story, and does his best to delay the execution; Schwarzkof, chief of NJ police;\\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan who \\"may have\\" been in the house the night of the crime. Why didn't Lindy go to the NYU celebration the night of the crime? The seemingly unanswered questions in this reckoning add up to the flimsiest excuse for a \\"Solution\\" you'll ever find! In fact, it is downright ridiculous! But like any controversial and famous crime, another case is built here, this time around a supposed culprit that is so bad , it detracts from the other may outstanding parts of this book!	2005-05-27

Many of the basic,well known aspects of FS's life are mentioned here, starting with the Genoan and Sicilian branches of his family history, his quiet father and brash, Democratic Ward Leader mother. The segment on Bing Crosby's huge influence on 1930's popular culture, especially in the new radio-centered family (like TV today) is great, and perhaps not known too much today. FS as an icon for immigrant Italians, along with LaGuardia and DiMaggio, is also a high point. The days with James and Dorsey are also well done, if rehashes, like much of this otherwise excellent book. And much is written about FS's legendary \\"Fall\\" and 2nd Rise, the Fall being among the most overdone of FS's incredible life.(Many would love to fall from such Olympian heights!). Mr. Hamill says that the music is what matters. Obviously, he's right! Only Frank could sing so well about the depths of anguish and despair, as well as the thrill of triumph! The author also gives a nice summation of the great work of FS with Nelson Riddle. Unfortunately, short shrift is given to Billy May, and a short paragraph mocks the \\"sugary\\" work of Gordon Jenkins. Oddly, the most famous pairing of Jenkins and FS, \\"September of My Years\\" is listed in the appendix as among Mr. Hamill's favorite albums! It would have been nice if a CD was included,since this book does not really mine the golden depths of FS's best recordings. Still, all in all, a fine and succinct presentation of The Man and His Music.	2005-05-24

This is very short, easy to read commentary on the greatness of Lincoln, and on how Abe's speeches and actions can be relevent today. Needless to say, in the comparisons between the Great Emancipator and the current Administration, Abe easily overwhelms Bush II,&Co. Gov. Cuomo's main point is the Lincoln's actions and words were for all time, and addressed to everybody,literally in all lands. His thoughtful, last resort approach to war is contrasted with the current deceptive drive to war in Iraq. Cuomo suggests that FDR and Lincoln had a lot in common in attempting to aid those who have troubles helping themselves. He also states that Lincoln's ecumenical religious approach is in sharp contrast to today's GOP. All in all, a thoughtful argument, and the author's criticisms are never overwrought. In fact, he seems to make a special effort to maintain civility throughout the book.	2005-05-24

Is there literally anyone in world history who within 36 hours came from being a relative unknown to the toast of the entire planet, or at least anyone with a radio or newspaper? Lindbergh makes the Beatles huge success 37 years later seem almost trivial! And for good reason! His achievement in flying solo from NY to Paris  was truly monumental! This great book traces CAL's early days through his unsuccessful college days, living with his mother, barnstorming,and then the phenomenal flight to Paris at the age of 25. Babe Ruth had a great year in 1927, but compared to Lindbergh even he was small time! The terrible tragedy of the Lindbergh Bay kidnapping/murder is told in all its incredible detail with unlikely characters like an expert in wood and lumber, who analyzed the ladder's components, and an eccentric who received the ransom notes in a Bronx cemetary. Based on the evidence, even if it is circumstantial, there appears no doubt that Hauptmann was the culprit. Then Chas and his wife, Anne, globetrot to just about every place in the planet, even assisting in China during a horrendous flood. CAL even helped to develop an artificial heart in a NYC lab, and took aerial photos of Mexican ruins that may otherwise have taken decades to discover.His support for the Amercica First Committee is detailed, along with very antagonistic comments by Ickes and others in the FDR admintration, not to mention CAL's even more controversial medals from Nazi Germany which he never returned. After Pearl Harbor, his great aeronautical skills greatly aided in the Pacific War, and he even flew some very dangerous missions. This book goes all the way to the end when our hero became an environmental tree hugger (literally), and supporter of nature movements, including \\"Save the Whale\\" groups.In closing, a great bio, not to be missed!	2005-05-17

Mr. Krakauer is putting together a truly superior body of work, and UNDER THE BANNER may be his best so far! This book switches between the very unusual history of the Mormon Religion, and the horrific events of July, 1985, specifically the planned murder of a young woman and her 15 month old baby (who is the killer's niece) by a fundamentalist who believes he was performing the will of God. The founding of this American religion in the 1830's during the 2nd \\"Great Awakening\\", through their treks from NY to Illinois and to the Great Salt Lake are mesmorizing, along with massacres, tribulations, and a cast of characters including Pres. Buchanan and Lincoln. Anyone wanting to learn how a religion can turn into an obsession can't miss with this book! Outstanding in every way!	2005-05-04

Mr Chase seamlessly narrates Ted K's life, from the working class and underappreciated  Chicago High School \\"Geek\\" who was excellent in about everything except sports, and (by inference)social activities, to the 16 year old nerdy and poor Harvard Undergrad. No doubt that with his 170 IG, Mr. K. could have been a leading mathmatician, and he wrote incredible papers in Grad School at Michigan. Taking part in a \\"Sociological\\" study at Harvard with the renowned Prof Murray may very well have help started his contempt for society, turning into the hateful bomber of 10 years later. The author stresses the culture and curriculum of \\"despair\\" which seems overdone. He feels that by about 1970 most leading universities were practically indoctrinating their students into this mode. Frankly, at Columbia in the early 1970's, I did not find this at all! Anyway, he continues with LSD and CIA experiments just after WW2. All very fascinating, but still not necessarily relevant to Mr. K's situation. The best part is the beginning where the crimes of Ted K. are described in stunning detail, and his diaries shows his total contempt for his many victims. One wonders how anyone could be so heartless to anyone, much less total strangers! Outstanding all the way, even if we are still feeling that the enigma of the Unabomber is still not solved!	2005-05-03

All his characters are finely drawn, and the atmosphere is fairly dripping with fluid description. Inspector Wallender is among the very best of today's thoughtful and slightly burned out police detectives, and the social background here is done beautifully,too. The 3 flaws are(1) we know the killer too soon, which makes this reviewer less likely to turn the pages,(2) Wallender's forgetfulness of losing his keys,(3)his forgetfulness in checking out photos of the crime scene.This gives away nothing in this otherwise near perfect realistic, contemporary European thriller.	2005-04-29

Lou was brought up in the early 1900's-1910's in the (then)German immigrant section of Yorkville-NYC. His father appears as a ne'er do well, his mother a hard worker doing about anything to keep her family going. In fact, many of Lou's siblings died  of childhood diseases now hardly ever killers. So Lou had more than the usual obstacles to overcome. Fortunately, Lou's mom got a job working as a housekeeper at a Columbia fraternity, which helped Lou into the Columbia extension school program. Definitely not a great scholar, Lou was a record smashing player at Columbia, at first shunned by scouts because he had a tough time hitting a curve ball, a problem Lou worked on, and eliminated. Shy and introspective,somewhat of a mama's boy, the portrayal in THE MOVIE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES seems very close to the mark! When Wally Pipp, a very formidible Yanks 1st Baseman, was injured, it seemed clear as day that Lou would take over for a long time, 2130 games to be exact! The \\"Quiet Man\\" of the great Yank teams of the 1920's and 1930's proved to be the perfect man for the job, a nice foil to the wild and crazy Babe Ruth! Lou's long career and life are beautifully done, through his famous LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE speech, and his sad and slow death of  Lou Gehrigs Disease.A perfect biography, and with a photo of an upcoming singer/actor/autograph seeker named Frank Sinatra with Lou from the 1939 World Series. Needless to say, how many Pro Athletes today have the character of LOU GEHRIG!	2005-04-25

Always very polite and a bit understated, the CD begins commenting on Copernicus and Galileo, scientists contradicting the dogma of their times. Then onto Church responses to disease including 1600's Plagues, and Smallpox. The blame was put on demons and devils, not germs aor viruses.

Also, the Langs first 2 children are hardly even mentioned until they are grown up at the end. And the two traumatic diseases occur practically out of nowhere. Still, since this book is so well crafted, wonderfully described and imagined, and informative in so many ways, it's definitely the highest possible rating. For a journey though a 35 year friendship, family and professional loyalties,university life and expections, explorations of life in the Depression 1930's, this one is top of the line!	2005-02-20

Analyzing Greek,Chinese, Cambodian sculptures, some of the best known western SMILE paintings,Japanese geishas (who dyed their teeth black), early US Presidents (a bit dour until the advent of Teddy Roosevelt),Darwin's thoughts on the facial habits of his new-born babes, and a lot more, we are led through a smiling tour de force.

Vasari's LIVES has lived for over 450 years, and it's easy to see why! From Cimabue to Titian, he covers (in this edition)over 40 artists during about a 250 year period! A great artist himself, Vasari spares no superlatives in describing the work and lives of these individuals.They are just about all \\"most excellent\\", and produced titanic painting, sculpture, and architecture. He claims (erroneouly, according to the editors) that one murdered his rival, and definitely was not a nice guy. But the rest are generally given the royal treatment. Oddly,Botticelli seems a tad slighted. The Big Three, Leonardo,Raphael, and Michaelangelo are practically bathed in the light of the devine!.Many anecdotes are mentioned, which give real life and sometimes fun to these Olympians. Plus, discussions of the progress and styles/ techniques which come full flower with these Big Three.	2005-02-15

Two German brothers who came of age in the early 1900's to become world wide literary and historic figures wrote extentively to each other for nearly fifty years. They discuss just about anything two brothers can, and by the Great War were not only literary, but also serious political sibling rivals. Heinrich was the international socialist condemning the war, Thomas supporting the war as an extention of the great German Kultur, of which he was a formost spokesman. They gradually made up, and both expressed their total contempt for the Nazi gang as early as the 1920's. By this time (1929), Thomas won the Nobel Prize, and became the more famous and financially successful. By the late 1930's, they both  moved to the USA, where Thomas, by then a huge world wide anti-Nazi figure, supported his older brother spiritually and finanically. A unique book of letters between two great 20th Century GOOD GERMANS, though today Heinrich is relatively unknown, compared to his Olympian younger brother.	2005-02-03

This beautifully designed small coffee table paperback is the perfect guide thru US WW2 patriotic industrial and gov't posters. Yes, sometimes one may have felt \\"Big Brother\\" is watching, since these artistic posters decorated the walls of factories, building sides, and seemingly near everywhere during the war years. The message invariably was \\"Be A Nurse\\", \\"Help the Troops\\", \\"Contribute to the effort\\", and most important \\"Don'T SHIRK ON THE JOB..MAKE EVERY MOMENT COUNT FOR THE BOYS OVERSEAS!\\" Of course similar posters were designed and displayed by all combatants, and their messages were all near identical.

First, the bond trader who's just made a killing for going against the conventional wisdom about the forthcoming unemployment report. Second, the very frustrated private school English teacher, who earns about 3.3% of the aforementioned bond trader.Third, the movie star handsome lady's man who got into drug dealing when young, and through a snipper has 24 hours left before heading to a 7 year federal prison term. We meet the local Ukrianian mafia, some shady club owners, a brainy & foxy high schooler, and many other well drawn, realistic characters crusing through this wintry 24-hour NYC scene. Near perfect, especially for a first novel, and the ending is actually borderline beautiful as our drug dealing anti-hero has to finally decide what to do with his young life.	2005-01-30

If you can manage through some truly loathesome characters in a really dysfunctional family (all grown up, no less), then you'll really enjoy this twisted murder story about various very spoiled family members in 1920's upper crust east side NYC. The hilites include some nice scenes in the big city, and  witty and amusing dialogue, not to mention some estoric comments on art and criminalogy by the intrepid Vance, who is not as \\"obnoxious\\" as ofen made out,plus interesting medical treatments at the time. DA Markman and his underlings also provide some near comic relief to a really gruesome story. The culprit was not too hard to figure for an old mystery fan like me, but all in all a solid and thoughtful whodunnit from the old school! Van Dine is today a very underrated expert at the old classic mystery.	2005-01-30

Not only is it a stupendous browser, but one can practically read it from start to finish without getting too difficult or scientific, for an interested amateur like myself. And there are drawings, diagrams ,sketches covering children's art, illusions, on and on. Plus short bios of the greats (like Newton,Hegel,Rosseau, Sartre, Kant,,etc, etc),plus many lessor known ,but perhaps of equal distinction..Subjects like religion, magic, medicine, out of body experiences, hallucinations, are given active note, not to mention some less known, but still interesting subjects.

When this book came out about 70 years ago, it probably was totally outrageous and unique in its own anti-social and slightly sado-masochist way. It does have its funny moments, almost cartoonish. like the Three Stooges with wild and crazy sex, and scatology for some good laughs! And as a story of a man completely free in the modern world (1930's) with not a care in the world, it may even deserve some of its semi-classic stature! But it is not showing Henry'y best writing by any stretch! For that look into his travelogues, and pieces on mid-century America (eg \\"Air Conditioned NightMare\\" and Greek Guides)!  but as far as being completely outrageous, with no holds barred, Henry does reign supreme!...... d	2005-01-21

One gets the impression here that the famous author is \\"showing off\\" his knowledge of New York big shots, big money, big violence (including murder and rape), big hotels (the Waldorf), and having a scalding ego trip in the process. Also doing some big, unnecessary namedropping (like JFK- the biggest name at the time). Sure this book has its moments, though the unnecessary sadism trumps most of them! In fact, I'm usually a big admirer or this many faceted penmen. His collection \\"Time of our Times\\" is among the great single author anthologies out there (chosen by Mr. Mailer, no less!)..So even if this one's not a real dog, given the vast quality of much of his stuff, this one should be kept near the bottom of his, mostly outstanding, oevre!	2005-01-18

There's been tons of (often far out) research in to LH Oswald that it's tough to decide which books on the subject are worth looking into. The number of theories/ideas/plots etc. could fill a library (and probably do). So it's a real treat to read a highly researched, authoritative, and slightly imaginative book that goes beyond the standard \\"Loser\\", \\"Stooge\\" or worse hypothesis, and goes into about every aspect of this 23 year old assassin's life, especially his problematic,very strange, time in the USSR.Remember, after some time in the Marines, he defected to Minsk at the age of 21. So what happened there? This book makes a valiant attempt to find out, and probably comes as close to the truth as we'll ever get!

Whether describing third graders in and out of class (remember the phrase \\"Hey, wait up\\") and comparing two teachers during Christmas season, or the tough,seeming brutality of a drill sergeant, a mother sculpting FDR himself (and she's a life long Republican!), Paris right after the war (suggesting that Americans were widely disliked then), cocktail party reminiscenses of battling into Germany at the war's end, some Vets with TB looking to celebrate the new year,or mostly, just about any kind of relationship, Mr. Yates always hits the nail on the head! As far as the supposed \\"gloominess\\", this is more than offset by the quirky and amusing situations, and some laugh out loud dialogue.

This is easily the best bio I've read of any writer, who is not included among the historical/political types. Once you get to page 50 or so, guaranteed you'll be swept along in this roller coaster, and hold tight! Not only does this tell you the truly harrowing personal story of a frustrated, sickly, bizarre genius of a writer, but the times (1930's -1992) become alive too. If you want to know the details of getting published,teaching, financial struggles of a world class author, then check this out! For a look at a chain smoking alcoholic with severe health conditions, including an illness in getting enough oxygen to the brain, here it is. And as study in mental illness of an artist, trying to raise a family, and at times living in harrowing conditions, this again is the book to read! In fact, it is very similar to the recent book/movie A BRILLIANT MIND switched from a scientist to an author.

This is a relatively short, expertly done travelogue through time from 1914 to the present among the olden battlefields of France and Belgium of the Great War. The author has no illusions of what a \\"glorious war\\" this was. Journeying 450 miles from the Channel to the Swiss border through such towns and rivers as Somme, Marne, Passendaele, Ypres, Verden , and lesser known places, this is  real time travelling trip through history. The savagery of these battles is almost too immense for the author to describe, and the hundreds of cemetaries, ossuaries, monuments become near overwhelming, along with the awesome numbers of dead and wounded. And he is not shy in describibg the incredible arrogance of the generals (mainly Brit and French) who ordered some of these massacres. So for a short ride back in time and place, and to discover the chaos and death commonplace in these 85-plus year old catastrophes, this is a fine book and mesmorizing journey.	2005-01-07

This is probably among the top three of WSC bios, along with  Michael Gilbert, and Wm. Manchester's LAST LION (my personal favorite). It covers every aspect of the great man's adult life, the indisputable genius, with a few warts, especially the well known Dardonelles disaster, and the 1940 Norway campaign, being outfoxed and outgunned by the Germans. And the post-war years are also covered, including WSC's famous, cheap shots at the opposing Labor leader Atlee. Also, this is among the few WSC bios that give full credit to his very talented outside interests, especially painting, and shows some fine color pics of WSC's artwork. All in all ,a masterful job, even if a bit long at times!	2004-11-29

Or George's Mystical Side \\"B\\" of LADY MADONNA called THE INNER LIGHT, not to mention the slapdash YOU KNOW MY NAME,LOOK UP THE NUMBER. The list goes on and on, and you realize this foursome had by far the best songbook of the rock era, good enough to compare with some of the best of earlier tunesmiths like Cole Porter, and the Gershwin brothers. My only complaint..Mr Riley trashes the heavy orchestration one of my favorites, LONG AND WINDING ROAD. (Why is this great song so heavily criticized?)

After the Jack In the Box disaster of 1994, resulting in the death of several children, the GOP House rejected Clinton's legislation to clean up beef slaughterhouses. (Should not be a surprise). This is a fine study of big business not always doing what is best for the consumer/customer.

Mr. Hedges really tells it like it is here in this moving, shattering, and at times beautiful book on the complexities of war, from the beginnings to the end, sometimes not really ending for generations. As a war correspondent, he has really been thru the mill, has witnessed  more in a moment than most will experience in our lifetimes. From Central America, Iraq, Africa, most especially the former Yugoslavia, he shatters many of the perception of how \\"lovely\\" wars can be. Though this is an old story (Mr. Hedges goes back to the Iliad and the Odyssey, and often quotes Shakespeare), obviously it's something which can never be told enough. Love and death may be two elements of the human condition, but there is doubt that Mr. Hedges knows death is the rule in war. So read this book, and let's hope like \\"All Quiet\\". \\"Rumor of War\\", and all the others, this one never stays out of print, and better yest, is given to the schoolrooms all over the world	2004-11-28

I think the main theme here is the petty, rancerous bickering that has inflicted such a huge segment of this country. Mr. Roth's story occurs during the summer of 1998, among the nastiest,most sanctimonious, and pettiest during the over 200-year life of the Republic. He also shows how all of us, at least those of any dimension whatsoever, really have many lives, many secrets, and how difficult it can be to escape them. All the main characters, from the Professor Silk, his relatives, his girlfriends over the years, the anguished Vietnam vet,the French faculty member, and the rest are thus portrayed. Also of note is Mr. Roth's near-magical ability to make seemingly dull everyday routines like milking the cows, going to a Chinese restaurant,etc.  interesting. This is the ability and talent of true artist. No one can doubt that Mr. Roth fits this description!	2004-09-28

Along the way, there are nice detours through local colonial and Indian  history going back to the early 1600's,vanished old settlements and very old bones, some interesting locals, all in today's world of casinos and longtime family grudges. The writing here is near perfect, as we glide through this tale.

Hard to believe the party of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagon, and yes Nixon, has stooped to this depth! Even to the point of some conventioneers wearing purple band-aids at the recent convention! Given their 9 year slander campaign of Bill Clinton, though, it should not be a surprise. Are we to believe that the thousands of medals and commendation given to US Military Servicemen for over 200 years may be tainted? Are we to believe that the entire process of awarding service medals during this period is a fraud? No other publisher but Regnery would stoop to these depths, since every decent publisher has at least minimal publishing standards. So this book impugns the very integrity of the US Military during its entire history, not just one Democratic Presidential candidate. And last, am I to think that the medals my grandfather won in 1918 at Belleau Wood may be a fraud too? This book simply validates the smear reputation of its publisher. When only one (at least from what I've read) major GOP politician,Sen John McCain, repudiates this book and related ads, you know there is a serious problem within one of our two great political parties. We should all know the two reasons why this book was published..(1) to slander Sen. Kerry, and the Democrats,(2) to make money..What it really is, is a slander towards the whole people of the USA.	2004-09-09

Very entertaining, and makes a great Halloween gift, but the only problem is that Mr. wilson, despite his great intellect and writing skills, seems to fall for about every humdrum and humbug rumor about his subject without subjecting it to serious, objective evaluation. Myriad cases are described throughout this excellent and entertaining book, but perhaps the best is the Flying, Levitating St. Joseph, in which the author simply accepts all supposed witnesses from nearly 400 years ago with not a shred of skepticism.

Here are some mostly top drawer essays about Pres. Bush, before his Presidency. So I'll just note a few items not noted much by others here. The first is his religious conversion at about age 40, and questioning whether Jews can get to heaven. When he asks his mother, Barbara, if this is possible, she suggests calling Billy Graham, who replies that Mr. Bush should not play God. Second is his remarkable method of getting rich , by parlaying $600,000 into $16 million, by forcing certain well off people to move, and passing (barely) a referendum to apply a sales tax to pay for the new stadium. In both cases, property rights and low taxes appear at odds with standard GOP thinking! With the new stadium, the investors net worth skyrocketed! If only we could all be so fortunate! His time as Texas governor seems average enough, and there are some accomplishments in education and other areas. So this seems a reasonable critique for all sides.	2004-08-25

Anyone should know that Maureen was also bashing Bill Clinton for over 8 years, just as she's critical of GW Bush now.

But Maureen's best column describes how, yes, perhaps we should attack a nation that is a breeding ground for Islamic terrorists, and the home of most of the 9/11 killers..no not Iraq, but maybe Saudi Arabia! Like many of us, she said that attacking Iraq would become a great recruiter for bin laden and his friends.

This is the first in modern superstar  Dan Brown's virtual alter-ego Robert Langdon 24 hour magic mystery conspiracy thrill ride, and the prequel to the even better known DA VINCI CODE. The author seems to have patented the Clark Kent/Indiana Jones turned modern day (near) Superman, rescuing the damsel in distress, not to mention saving the great ancient city of Rome! And he brings to life some great artists (Bernini and Raphael), and art (like the Ecstacy of St. Theresa) until now practically unknown to the average US citizen.With plenty of controversial science vs religion ideas tossed about, some uncanny villains, and an ending which even surprised me. Since I read DA Vinci Code first, I was way off in guessing the culprit here, a real surprising twist! No other writer alive mixes arcane history, religion, philosophy, and keeps the reader hooked with great locales, near comic book action,  minute by minute action, and zesty fun and humor to boot!

I am surely no expert on the French Revolution, but this book seems to confirm my prior limited knowledge of the subject. Mr. Loomis is a fine writer who not only evaluates the (mostly horrible) events, but also the personalities and backgrounds. The beginning section about Charlette Corday and the assasination of Marat was flawless, the section on Danton perhaps not quite as good, and the grand finale on Robespierre near perfect! In short, this book covers the year of the Paris Great Terror (1793-4) superbly! There is even some wry humor for good measure to offset some truly sickening episodes of man's inhumanity towards his fellow man. In short, as close to perfect as one can expect!	2004-08-13

About Great War& Its Immediate Aftermath	This is a very fair, balanced, extremely readable history of the the last years of WW1, the various revolutions and mutinies in 1918 and 1919 (mainly in Germany, but also Hungary,etc.)and the grand finale of the Versailles Treaty. When reading this book, one cannot help but agree with the thoughts of Jan Christian Smuts, who very accurately predicted the great and horrible events of the next 25 years. Apparently, Pres. Wilson did not carry out his lofty ideals in the end, Lloyd George had serious second thoughts (persuaded in part by Smuts), and Clemenceau remained angry and adament. This is among the few books that I've read that tells about all sides of the story. The six weeks between the first Versailles meeting (on the 4th anniversary of the Lusitania attack), and the final signing are especially well done here. I never realized that the Allies were on the verge of attacking Germany if the Treaty was not signed ASAP. We also forget that the Allied naval blockade continued for about 6 months after the Armistice, resulting in the deaths of thousands of German children. It did not end until the final signing of the Versailles treaty.In short, a whale of a good book!	2004-08-09

First of all, I think Thomas Mann is without doubt the very greatest 20th century author! I am familiar with about everything he wrote, as well as his very interesting life. But I have found Dr. Faustus to be simply very rough going. The book's basic theme is outlined by many other reviews here. Though a very serious subject (life and death and the horrors of WW2), there is still not the wry humor I find in Mann in his other blockbusters (MagicMountain,Buddonbrooks,Royal Highness,Felix Krull,etc), so that solemnity overwhelms this great enterprise. In fact,in my humble opinion, the 2 best parts are his descriptions of prehistoric life under the sea, and the bombings of great German cities. The characterizations seem a bit dry, with nothing like the amusing personages in say, the Magic Mountain. And the descriptions of musical compositions practically require an advanced degree from the Julliard School. So these small criticisms simply suggest that great patience, learning, and thinking are required to fully appreciate this great novel, and probably this reviewer does not have these three qualities in ample quantity to really appreciate Dr. Faustus!	2004-08-04

Oddly, this man of phenomenal powers of observation was duped at a seance, the experience leading to spiritualist scene (Highly Questionable) in the Magic Mountain. The author does not mention Mann's own observations on this odd subject. in his Essays for 3 Decades. Even more than Hemingway, his family had severe suicidal tendencies, including his sister, sister in law, and two children, including Klaus, a renowned author in his own right. T. Mann was surely an imperious father, distant and aloof, and had his disputes with his older brother , Heinrich, mainly during the great war. Thomas was a great defender of German Kulture, Heinrich an international socialist. Still, his leading role as an anti-Nazi &quot;Good German&quot; cannot be denied, and after the war, he was subject to anti-communist hysteria rumor-mongering in the USA, so he moved back to Switzerland. He was an inveterate traveller, often ill, but still managed to find the time to write some of the greatest literature ever. In sum, an excellent bio of a rare, though flawed, genius!	2004-08-02

In THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY, Mr. Larson even surpasses his earlier ISAACS STORM, no mean achievement! Yes, there was a time over 100 years ago,when a great American city could rally its citizens and, despite incredible odds (winter storms, floods, financial panics,the deaths of leading participants, etc) conceive and build a fantastic world's fair, the 1893 Columibia Exposition. This vast enterprise showcased just about every scientific, cultural, entertainment event of the time, and in its best days, could bring in over 200,000 people, including a woman who walked the 1,300 train track route from Galveston, Texas to Chicago! After much thought, the expo's leaders decided it was impossible to top the earlier Paris Fair's Eiffel Tower, so an engineer named Ferris designed and build the now famous 264 foot &quot;Wheel&quot; that could carry over 2,000 passengers. The expo did not feel completely comfortable hosting the Buffalo Bill Show, so Old Bill had his own show next door, a wild and crazy Circus of the Old West (not so old at the time). Meanwhile a thoroughly depraved newcomer to the city build his bizarre &quot;World's Fair Hotel&quot;, a true house of horrors. Through some solid detective work, in Chicago, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Philadelphia, this lunatic con man / serial killer is finally captured. The author weaves both situations together for an amazing story, and a third smaller murder case is also described, though the victim is a very famous Chicagoan. The author even describes his literary and research methods at the end of the book ,so the reader can learn his techniques. Don't we wish this was the case in all books! When Mr. Larson's next book comes out, you can bet I'll be among the first to read it!!	2004-07-26

Our intrepid hero, a Justice of the Peace/ Magistrate in the Philly Suburbs, gets cancer, and his wife, a professional pet-lover, dies while avoiding a dog on a termite infested bridge. He decides he's had enough, he wishes to take on God, 2 miles long and recently comatosely discovered, to Court, at the Hagues' International Court of Justice. At first, this seems too large a task, until he is assisted by a strange Harvard professor who made millions writing children's books. This same professor takes on the &quot;Not Guilty&quot; side, and this begins our journey through on a hallunicatory, fanatastic, trip through good and evil. Journeying through the Body and Mind of God Himself, we meet the &quot;platonic/ideal&quot; visions of Adam, Even, Lot's Wife, St. Augustine, the Devil, and many others. At the trial, we witness some very serious discussions on the nature of good and evil, as some expert witnesses are brought along. This is a real mesmorizer,a book that should last a very long time! The ending may be a slight disappointment, but given the circumstances, is as fair as one could expect.	2004-07-26

First of all, like Mr. Brown's now world famous current novel, this is simply a great read! And that is my main criterion for any book! Just about everything in DA VINCE CODE is critiqued and analysed, from a photo of the  book's inferences about some of the &quot;clues&quot; in the LAST SUPPER, with markings included, to real trivia like how near the Men's Room in the Louvre is to the road outside, and is the castle in Paris real.Or was the Agnus Dei headquarers in NYC given a high rating by Architectural Digest (etc.etc.) Sure, there are some holes in the book (DVC), which after all is a fictional novel, somewhat like an Umberto Ecco novel, but a much better and breezier read, and vastly superior narrative! Even while picking apart many trivialities, many of the commentators in SECRETS OF THE CODE note that many of the main premises have a lot of historical basis, such as that the books of the Bible were hand picked at the Niceon meeting (around 310 AD), and others tossed in the garbage (later discovered 1700-plus years in the Egyptian desert as the Gnosnic Books).The great thing about a book like MR. Brown's is it makes people think, something that has not been encouraged all the time by many organizations, not exempting religions. So read the DaVinceCode first, then check into this highly readable, but super well done guide!	2004-07-15

Set between Winter, 1953, and Autumn, 1954 (except at the very end), this is a very, very fine look at the world seen through a very intelligent and sensitive 19 year old only (male) child, and his days in and around the great city of Chicago. Living a priviledged life literally on the golf course/ country club, this book grabs you from the first line, with the descriptions of union troubles and strikes at his father's paper plant, and his father skating in the nearby pond. The 1st person narrator (i.e. the 19 year old) is much quieter and more thoughtful than Dad, the team player who see his business torn apart by the strike. He seeks freedom beyond this narrow confine in the jazz clubs of the city, and the debutante balls among the upper crust, meeting many unusual people, including a psychiatrist with an unusual secret, plus his daughter whom our 19 year falls for. There's a lot going on between the lines, and the prose is perfect thruout. The ending seems very vague, but that may be the author's intention. All in all, a very worthy effort by Mr. Just.	2004-07-12

Mr. Overy states that the allies were able to unify the command of the war, as well as the industrial capacity to win the war. His descriptions of the USSR moving huge industrial complexes behind the Urals, and beyond the German reach, are about the best I've read. The main difference between 1942 and 1943 is that by 1943 the USA and the USSR were able to mobilize their vast and much larger military, industrial and manpower resources, a fact somewhat downplayed here, where the author stresses the top heavy organizational layers in German industry. Also, he makes little note that the Germans thought the war was practically over by 1941, after the fall of France, and their industry was still geared for consumer products, not military, and the Brits and later the Russians and Americans were 24 hour military operations. Many other sources state that the top Nazi leaders simply did not want women in the workforce, and produced consumer goods to keep the home front happy. This did not really change until Speer reorganized production by 1944 to a near total war footing. Also sabotage in the occupied areas played a major role in keeping some of these plants from their full military potential. Still, a fine read, and very interesting and compelling arguments.	2004-07-12

Dark Light is a great intro to a subject that we all take for granted, but whose scientific and cultural origins are a mystery to   most of us, including me before I read the book. If you want to discover how the western world looked at the new scientific and commercial force of electricity, this book is perfect! From the early days of SB Morse and the telegraph,(artist turned inventor and promoter), to some weird &quot;New Age&quot; (for the time) ideas about electricity and health, the incredible carrers of Edison, Tesla (the overlooked genius), among many others, this book scores a bull's eye. Plus a nice trip into the 1892 Chicago Columbian exhibition, through the controversial electric chair, and into the x-ray, plus a lot more. There is not too much about how the nation was wired up, and how the utility companies were formed, but this may be the author's next project!	2004-07-06

After Mr. Marcus flies from Portland to Seattle for his first interview, he is asked his thoughts about possibly working 60 hours a week. His response is he would not to too thrilled! Despite this, he  gets the job ($44K plus options for 1,000 shares), and moves with his small family to Seattle, described as a shoddy version of Portland that could use a paint job. The first few months at this fledging internet book retailer are probably the best, and gradully the author realizes that maybe this is the start of something big! The Christmas season is spent away from book reviews, packaging books in the warehouse, a job not initially too rewarding, but with a zen like work drive, he pulls off with his usual flair and humor. Then there is the thrill of the first stock offering, and the fruition of the GET BIG FAST formula. He compares his career with his ancestors who fled Russia during the 1917 Revolution with many rubles sown in their pockets that became worthless, not unlike the internet stock bubble / bust. Finally, Mr. Marcus can take advantage of his options, and describes how $54,000 somehow materializes in his account, but most of this will pay off debts and bills. There is nifty free-flowing Kerouacean quality through most of this book, and some interesting thoughts on Emerson's and his &quot;Eye on the Universe&quot;, an all knowing vision, not unlike the best of the the Internet. And at a company picnic, after the company has hit it big, Mr. Bezos himself is the person getting soaked in a water dunking contest! Finally, Mr. Marcus decides to move on,flies back to NYC in early Sept, 2001, and witnesses the Terror Massacres from Great Jones Street. My only complaint is his seeming lack of enthusiasm for the incredible web site which really has changed the world!	2004-07-01

This is a strong account of the decisons leading up to, and following up the War in its early days. It's obvious that Mr. Bush wanted to get S. Hussein, and most of his advisors were a bit less enthusiastic, though they too decided to start this war. Not too much is said about Mr. Powell's UN speech, which has been pretty much ignored, even though even Mr. Powell has admitted there were many holes in it.  All the main players were with Bush I, and all had their reasons for a new war, and 9/11/01 simply lit the fuse. The president seems both cautious and enthusiatic , perhaps having occasional doubts behind the scenes. He seems fairly naive about war plans when told these take &quot;years&quot;, and were not as simple and easy as perhaps the President thought. Perhaps most disturbing was that a few weeks after the bombs and missles were dropped, Mr. Bush asked about Iraqi casualities, and was  told &quot;about 30,000&quot;. This very jolting number seems to be taken without too much thought, though it was stated these were almost all &quot;non-civilian combatants&quot;. And at the very end when Mr. Woodward asks Mr. Bush about the lack of evidence for the weapons of mass destruction, it seems the president would rather not talk about it. Definitely worth the time and effort!	2004-06-30

Preston gives a wonderful picture of this historical horror, almost as if the reader is sitting in the captain's seat! Starting out with the background, history of subs (though the Monitor and Merrimack are not mentioned- my only criticism), British code-breaking, the political and miltary stances on all sides, the many warnings given by the Germans beforehand, the strange personality of Kaiser Wilhelm, we are slowly led into terrible decision to launch the torpedo, and the thoughts of several German submariners, including the Captain. When the torpedo strikes, and all heck breaks loose, the author places the reader right there with great prose and some unique photos too! The suffering and dying is described in no uncertain terms, and parts of this book may actually make you cry. Almost all of  the 37 babies died, passengers were torn up by the propellers, the life boats collapsed on a lower boat, crushing or maiming those in the lower boat..Not for the faint-hearted, but an all too real description of man's inhumanity to man. It seems there was plenty of blame to go around. Finally, the rescue operation seemed to take way to long, given that it was known that Lusitania could be a target, and that the sinking occurred only about 12 miles from  heavily populated coatal Ireland. A book for the ages!	2004-06-28

Diana was of the fabled Mitford sisters, and with the exception of her suicidal sister, Unity, the most bizarre. Both were completely infatuated with the Fuhrer, and his Germany. Now, in 2004, anyone can state the obvious about Nazi Germany. In the 1930's, this was definitely not as clear as now. Many forget the incredible attraction of the 1930's Germany to many at the time, not all Germans. And there was a deperate need not to have another terrible war between Germany & Birtain. Through her husband, the British Fascist Oswald Mosley, Diana, and Unity, met and befriended many top Nazi leaders. In sum, a really fine book in every way, not least for its insights into the times. A minor complaint is that the author could have written more about Diana's two author sisters, Jessica and Nancy, the 2 real brains in the family, both definitely more \\"normal\\" than Diana and Unity.	2004-06-08

Much of the information detailed by Mr. Clarke was stated in the August, 2002 TIME Magazine Front Page Story &quot;The Secret History&quot;. The idea that the Bush administration was focused on &quot;Star Wars&quot; and adversaries like China, while not giving AL Quada top priority was very clear in this article, by a top magazine not known for its &quot;lefty&quot; tendancies. In fact, TIME stated that Mr. Clarke was like a wolf crying for help before the 9/11/01 attacks, and his ideas were never given full attention. In fact , not until 9/4/01, were his recommendations given formal review and approval, 8 months after they were submitted. Mr. Clarke also states clearly how the Iraq war has been a distraction, and has been a great recruiting tool for the terrorist groups. Whereas before the war, there were almost no terrorist groups in Iraq, today, a year later, Iraq  is a vast incubus for these groups. This book will be a great classic, and the sad thing is the response from those in power.	2004-03-29

The incredible suffering of civilians is also described, families burnt alive or suffocated, a group of well heeled restauranters who are trapped and commit suicide together, and thousands more. The German medical/ health response is surprisingly strong, given the huge difficulties. His final death and casualties may be low, and he seems to suggest that Dresden \\"had it coming\\", though he does show some compassion for all sides. Alexander's Mckee's earlier study describes much more from the side of the British pilots, who were not happy with the results of the bombing, and seemed perhaps misled by the RAF leadership. All in all, despite some controversial conclusion, a very worthy addition to the vast WW2 library!	2004-03-29

Having just bought, and read this book, and after having read Mr. O'Neill / Mr. Suskind's earlier book, it is obvious that the current administration was definitely not preparing for a cataclysmic attack by Al Quada. Much of this information has been available for a long time (see the July 2002 Time Magazine Cover Story \\"The Secret History), but seemingly ignored by most of the media. No one will ever know if the 9/11/01 massacre could have been avoided. But Mr. Clarke's strongest point is that without question, the Iraq war has only incited Al Quada and similar groups, and established Iraq as a terrorist center that did not exist before. The book is clearly written, and argued, should be read by everyone, regardless of your political leanings.	2004-03-22

Granted, he has some strange &quot;dates&quot; in a sleazy Chicago Hotel room, but they are with his wife, after all! So you wonder how this guy gets to be so weird! Mr. Theroux pulls off  this difficult task of convincing the reader that it all happens, and the reader gets a grand tour through some of the seamiest sides of Chicago, not to mention humanity itself!

Interesting how this celebrated writer mixes the hilarious, bizarre, inane, contemplative, and even the beautiful in one masterly contemporary novel. Two very odd people meet our frustrated 1st person writer- narrator, sending him on three rollicking, anarchic adventures in the Village. The trio battle a mental hospital, a big time real estate developer, and the world's #1 Coffee Chain. Along the way, some terrific dialogue, discussions of the art of the novel, the real vs the fantastic,and a general critique of modern urban society shine through. A fine page turner written by  a terrific pen man, with more than enough laughs for all. My only complaint: a bit too harsh on the three corporate adversaries, and our three Robin-Hood style protaganists may be interesting. but they are definitely not all that nice! A very tragic ending, but the last paragraph is a winner. maybe even a beautiful finale.	2004-03-10

It would be tough to find a writer with such a huge range as the great Gore Vidal in this or any other time! KALKI is surely one his &quot;breezy&quot;, less difficult reads, but it scores on every play! The story of a deranged ex-Vietnam vet who metamorphsizes into a huge Hindu cult leader takes direct aim at the super- commercial media society, cults and apocalyptic religions in general, government agencies, ultra feminism, and about any other hyped up cant of the 1970's , or 2000's. It's ultimate message is horrific, especially relevent today.

This beautifully written short novel by the great critic is among the best descriptions of the 1920's I've read! All the characters are based on real life people, and taken from the author's own notebooks, as descibed in the notes at the end of the book. Such luminaries as Dorothy Parker, Robery Benchley, and others of the renowned &quot;Round Table&quot; are included, not to mention Mr. Wilson's own love interests, shown quite indiscretely for the time. And the &quot;uncle&quot; in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, is truly bizarre! Also the architectural and travel (mostly train, but some auto) rides are perfectly done too! This is a fine book for the general reader, as well as the 1920's or Wilson afficionado. But perhaps too &quot;R-Rated&quot; for the school-set.	2004-03-06

But are there really schools which &quot;teach&quot; 8 year old boys about parenthood by making him carry a sack of flour? Maybe, but a strange way to teach!  Also, the infatuation with the mailman never really rang true to this jaded reader, but all is fair in love and war! And the ending seemed a bit unfocused, but probably still realistic.

His locale descriptions, and psychic feel for his characters make all his books worthwhile. The &quot;Quiet&quot; American, a young and naive Ivy Leaguer, is convinced his modern ideas can save Vietnam from inevitable chaos. Needless to say, he comes to a very rude awakening.

This great little book will be enjoyed for many years to come by people of all ages. Just transporting this bulky beast was enough of a headache, but fortunately its demeanor was (usually) cool, calm, and collected. In 1826, how could this animal set upon such a long, difficult journey? You'll learn in this book!  And the French were enthalled by this animal, so unique from all other animals in creation. The &quot;Zarafa&quot; became the center of a huge tourist industry attracting throngs of well-wishers and curiousity seekers for over a thousand miles! Like today's Super Bowl or Academy Awards, all kinds of momenta were made to celebrate (and earn a few francs) this singular giraffe, including clothes, and pottery.

This short tale of a well known architect who wants peace and quiet in a different world is definitely not everyone's cup of tea! And the title is about perfect! But for an exploration of a burnt out Englishman seeking solace and quiet in the tropics, and in  a leper colony no less, this is hard to  beat! You can feel the heat, the insects, and general overall misery. Greene was an inveterate traveller to these parts, and knew his subject. Whether the hero , Quarry, ever attains his much sought after &quot;redemption&quot; is up to the reader, but this book ,along with several similar ones in the vast Greene oevre, is a good,safe substitute to a trip to the haunted, disease ridden, tropics.	2004-02-24

Ron Hansen is among the best writers delving into unusual real-life historical situations, and trying to make sense of them. Mariette is a pretty 17 year old drawn to the convent, who immediately becomes a special, vision influenced, faith inspired, stigmatized True Believer. Many of the older nuns are skeptical (to say the least), while the younger ones are in awe. Mr. Hansen's guides us right into the heart and soul of this Catholic community, and of course Mariette. After reading this book, one feels a certain understanding of this potential saint, and how religion may become an obsession. I would personally  agree with her physician / father, the scientific skeptic, but Mariette's story is certainly believable in the hands of a fine writer like Mr. Hansen!	2004-02-23

As someone familiar with  many within the Fuhrer's immediate circle, I found this novel a terrific tale of what may have happened between him and his young niece, Geli Raubel. All the familiar characters, Goering,Goebbels, the chauffer (who, in this book, actually competes with Hitler over Geli's affections), and many others, seem all too real. The manipulative and mesmorizing  future dictator slowly becomes truly sickening, but he actually is not without some human feelings as well. The descriptions of 1920's-early 1930's Munich and Germany are perfect, and the everyday life of the Hitler and his entourage are just as good. Note the claustophobic feel of his large flat, and the slowly developing, urgent paranoia of Geli that becomes all too real. In fact, though she does feel strangely drawn to Hitler, she is among the few not drawn completely in his web. The ending may not be true , but still a great read, and fine job by Mr. Hansen!	2004-02-23

Some fine reviews here, but my main point is how relevent this amazing book is even after 16-plus years! It's so well-written and current (up to the 1840's anyway), you could almost think it was written today! The tulip hysteria in 1640's Holland is so famous some recent novels have been written about it! But the 2 best parts are the Crusades, and the Witchhunting sections, both religious-based mass hysteria. In the author's introduction ,he states that religious hysteria and delusions are so numerous he can barely scratch the surface! And think what's happened since 1842! The book is a bit dense at times, but you'll be amazed at the mass delusions described, sometimes resulting in mass slaughter, notably in the &quot;Crusades&quot; chapter. But this book should be familiar to every educated person, and will always be a classic!	2004-02-18

Then she goes back to 1895 New York City, and Cuba. She tell of a cigar smoking contest in 1946 Cuba between her granddad and Hemingway, sponsored by the original &quot;Old Man And the Sea&quot;, Mr. Fueuntes, who died in 2002 at the age of 104. As both a Churchill and Hemingway buff, this was a new story for me! And the travels continue through South Africe, World World 1 France, Egypt, and in all the other famous spots visited by her legendary granddad.

This was notably absent form the film&quot;) His growing paranoia has him searchin for secret UFO messages in the daily papers, not lining his office with magazines looking for Russian codes. He was not the depraved Cold War anti- Communist weirdo shown on the movie, but rather a very wierd UFO buff. And the book does not depict the various hallucinations, like his non-existent Princeton roommate, and the roomates non-existent niece. The book's a great read, and also describes his academic career in real detail. Since I read it a couple of years ago, before the movie came out, it did strike me as being much better than the outstanding movie.

Reading the first few pages of this extraordinary memoir convinces me that Vera Brittain was truly one of the great writers ever! In fact, it must be among the very greatest memoirs ever. So when I mention this book to friends, they without exception , have never heard of it! Granted it's about a war from long ago, starting 90 years ago, a horror that Vera B. looks at, and condemns with all her passionate genius. And there were hundreds of classics written at the time, written about this most senseless of wars, a slaughter worse than anyone could ever have predicted. But she describes with great compassion this nightmare, and its effect on herself and her generation. When you read about how her fiance is killed, it will be difficult not to put the book down, and do some serious thinking. And her nursing efforts aboard the SS Brittanica (later sunk by a German U-Boat) make a fine story as well. The book may be a bit dense, and overly literary, but it seems that during this era quoting poetry was a normal part of conversation, unlike today!.Anyway, give this book a chance and you'll be completed entranced by this incredible author!	2004-02-10

This beautifully written novel is and will always remain a classic, and is a real page turner even though there's no mystery or suspense. Every line is a gem, from the architectural descriptions to the cutting dialogue. In this world practically everyone is a useful ornament for someone else, afternoon luncheons and evening parties are about the only thing of note, and children are there to be looked after by the servants. In this book, the most likable character is indeed the young boy, who is completely frustrated and bewildered by nearly all the &quot;grown-ups&quot; he meets.And the final trip to the &quot;lost city&quot; in South America, with the truly bizarre Dickens buff, neatly concludes this grand slam of a book!	2004-01-28

The heroine's mixed up love life is mostly amusing, though it does seem to hit a strange wall with the very odd Giavanni at the end.

Did you know of certain artists who painted scenes on a human hair! Yes, bring your magnifying glass! Or singing in 2 part harmony with only one singer! I surely did not before reading this book! However, as a stamp collector starting at a very young age (about 7) , I also was fascinated by the Tanna Tuva stamps, and still have a nice assortment of diamonds and triangles. This book is an amusing and informative read, not least in its descriptions of meetings between Soviet and western scholars during some of the &quot;Bad Old Days&quot; of the 1980's Cold War, including moments like the shooting of KAL 007 near Korea. At times , though, there does seem to be a slightly condescending attitude towards a small section of Siberia based on what seems &quot;funny&quot; to English speakers. Nonetheless a very worthwhile read, with many amusing anecdotes, not to mention the amazing cancer recovery attitude of Mr. Feynmann himself!	2003-12-15

Yes, this was a unique and wonderfully written book, and it made me think back to my junior high days, with the friendships, sports teams, families etc. But all the way through I thought &quot;Are these police for real?&quot;  Because they seem completely at a loss to solve the crime, and later in the book truly pitiful! Also, the community, though appearing at a memorial service for the ghostly victim in heaven, did not seem as outraged by this atrocity as one might think..(And I grew up and still live in the Philadelphia suburbs locale). Nonetheless there were some wonderful moments and scenes, in the school, hospital, homes and anywhere else you can mention...But the large dump? Were these around in 1973, and could a family run this as a business? Seems unlikely. This pit would probably be condemned as unsafe! ..Some good reveiews here, so I'll keep mine short and simple, but my short criticisms point out some real flaws in what should ahve been a terrific book...Plus one wonders how this got all the PR and hype, when there are hundreds of others out there every year at least as well done as this!	2003-12-09

Also great descriptions, and you'll feel you're a casual witness to the academic shenanigans all the way through.

It seems there has been more interest in soap operas and sitcoms than in the trials and horrors of the vast nation that was our cold war enemy for so many years. Having read dozens of great books on the wars, revolutions, famines etc. of the recent Russian past, it was great to run across one that brought it all together, even if this huge story on occasion becomes macabre in it's deathly persistance. For all those horror fans out there, try this book, and you'll really get a dose of the real thing. Suffering and tragedy completely foreign to most of us. Say the seige of Leningrad during WWII (barely known here), where a great city the size of Chicago loses over a million civilians, more than all the casualties of all the American wars.If you can find a copy, grab it!	2002-12-05

A study of a middle aged woman slightly deluded about her aging charms with a daughter who seems to sympathize, but really knows better. As usual, some great descriptions of nature, medieval castles, and philosophical discussions between the two. Mann's seeming obsession with the hidden decay of the body, and perhaps German culture and society, are crystal clear. The writing, even in  English, is among his most mesmorizing.

I feel lucky to have been able to read this absolutely exquisite, yet at times gut wrenching, personal memoir, by a very gifted author who, it should be noted, is over twenty years younger than me. As one who has a very limited real life knowledge of medical life and death, it was an eye opener to (what sometimes seems) a completely different world. This is not only a sublime course in medical history and ethics, but a harrowing landscape of how the body can go wrong in myriad ways, and how the medical profession works its genius. The author has been through it from both sides too, and does not flinch in the telling. Not to be missed!

The author throws in all the entomology you'll ever want to learn, and more crazy antics than the Marx Brothers and the 3 Stooges combined, along with a nifty tour of some of the Big Apple's seamier streets...A terrific roller coaster with a few scary jaunts thrown in too, as our hero, termite/roach inspector battles some of the world's creepiest hitmen, and even the CIA makes an appearance...My only gripe(s) is there is a bit too much anti-NYC lore, and some of the NYC characters are totally charmless, especially the cynical, manipulative landlord across the street.Still a great read, and you may laugh out loud at least once per page, as I'm sure I did!	2002-10-06

Parts of this are really hilarious, and right on, but the... jokes, and pre-adolescent language can wear very thin..No doubt the current pop music culture is even worse than Joe describes, though thankfully the \\"Stones\\" aren't mentioned, even more thankfully they're not American, though he gives the Beatles some modest respect. It's true that much of the popular US culture nearly sinks to cesspool level, and Joe minces no words.His thoughts on the Noise Pollution (disguised as \\"pop music\\") are right on. After all, it is virtually impossible nowadays to go into any retail business (including banks) without being bombarded with the racket. But..some comments are simply not funny, and even more tasteless than the \\"artists\\" derided in the book. Turn to page 55 where the cast from \\"St Elmo's Fire is compared, after much thought, to the Big Shots at a 1934 Nuremburg Party Rally...Similar cheap shots infect a book that should have been a borderline classic..Unfortunately, Joe's smug, unfunny side is enough to nearly make one ready to toss this book exactly where he would like to toss so many of objects of his own derision.	2002-09-28

Give the author credit for brutal candor, and a direct, though at times wondrous, writing style. Greenwich Village NYC is seen here as very disturbing, nearly devoid of sympathy or sympathetic characters. We can only hope these cops are the awful exception. The 30-plus single NYU English teacher narrator seems a bit naive, or maybe overly hardened. The book really works as a guide to the Village dark side...More hard bitten than any Raymond Chandler, and with prose at times even more mesmorizing...A real jolt and definitely not for the faint hearted, but you'll want to finish this until the bitter end.	2002-09-23

Featuring a ghostly headless horseman,nun, carriages, unexplained flying household objects, eerie noises, wine turning into ink, locking of doors,mysterious written messages, etc. this must be the original \\"ghostbusters\\"  story, and the author is surely one heck of a writer and paranormal investigator...Oddly, just about all the characters involved seem a bit unruffled by these bizarre unexplained activities, but that could be the famed stiff upper lip amusement of the Brits...Really a super impressive book, but not completely convincing, though I admit I'm a skeptic in any case. Possible \\"human\\" explanations could be dreams, wish fulfillment, human error, weather changes,wind (noises) faulty/shaky building construction, certain participants \\"playing games\\" on the others, an ill woman often unaccountable during these curious goings on, superstitions, faulty sensory perception (like seeing pictures in clouds), even the financial motivation to write a book, though Mr. Price is surely a terrific, thorough writer!..This book may give you the creeps,but my simple advice is to buy it here (used), and you will be amazed.

Many readers associate Tom Mann with being super-erudite,solemn, and a tough read. Check out this book, and you'll learn this great author could be tongue in cheek, hilarious, and downright boisterous. Even more amazing is that he started this novel as young man (though an astoundingly successful and famous one after the phenomenal Buddenbrooks,published at the age of 26!), ands finished it 40 plus years and 2 world wars later, when in his 70's! A young man out to make his mark in the world evades the draft, frolicks with various high class ladies, learns the ins and outs of some mean European city streets, and generally proves himself a rogue of extraordinary powers! There are bits of the standards Mann philosophizing, comments on the Greek Gods,etc, but that is to be expected from this incredible genius of a writer. But for all those Mann doubters out there who stumbled over say, DEATH IN VENICE, MAGIC MOUNTAIN, FAUSTUS  etc. give this a try, since this only proves the tasty froth on this vast and distinguished literary cake by the GREATEST 20th Century Author!!!	2002-05-14

Most of us here in the old &quot;colony&quot; have probably never heard of General Gordon. For Brits, he's a legendary eccentric military man of the late 1800's who died a hero in terrible circumstances.(At least that's what I think many Brits think..) After a brilliant career in many parts of the vast Empire, and beyond, Gen Gordon was sent to control some Islamic revolutionary jihadist types (sound familiar) led by a charismatic Mahdi (messiah). By all accounts the general was a man worthy of this assignment, and brought his small force to Khartoum to free the slaves, and rally the locals...The rest is bizarre and insane in the extreme with the good general suffering breakdowns of sorts, including having dinner with some rodent friends...When word gets to London, after political maneuvering and bickering, the people damand an expeditionary force to save Gordon and his men.Too late!! A great tragedy ensues. If there's a better short bio out there than this one, I'd read it ASAP...Florence Nightingale has a great story too, and her experiences show once again the horrors of war (this time the earlier Crimean one), and indifference of the comfortable few sitting at home by the fireplace in willful ignorance. No doubt she was a force to be reckoned with, and her ideas about clean hospitals and nursing helped change the world...This book is recommended to those looking for a different historical perspective on current events, and for nurse everywhere! The other two bios are good, but may be put aside for later.	2002-01-31

I don't know why this awesome book has negative reviews here. It is a little difficult true. But for a New Yorkphile, like me, it can't be beat, if you want to know New York in the 1920's, and to a lesser degree the nation. All the familiar names are covered: Scott and Zelda, Woolcott, Parker, Gerstein Stein, Freud,Jazz and Ellington among many others. New York as a huge rush for outsiders from their first sight. The skyscraper boom, and builders and architects. The movie industry.The extreme dangers of transatlantic flights, and coast to coast mail deliveries. The Harlem Renaissance, basically the city as a reinventing, percolating tornado.FDR, Damon Runyan,Irving Berlin,WEB Dubois,Singing the Blues, Mary Pickford,  Babe Ruth, Jimmy Walker (the fun loving mayor with questionable morals)the Great White Way, the Cotton Club...It is just about an endless ride thru this great town in the 1920's and beyond, including the aftershock of the 1930's...Sometimes a little difficult, but you can browse through the index too and find hundreds of worthy subjects to check out...One of the best journeys through a time and place that I know!!

Anything with enough color photos of Old Masters will get a 5-star from me. My only complaint here is this one has only 12 in color, although there are 165 black and whites. Anyway, a wonderfully written work describing a good bit of the painter's world from about 1600-1665, including the classical Greek influence on many artists of the time, including Poussin. A nice tale of generally nice people (seems unusual) including patrons and collectors, centered in Rome. All in all a beautiful book,despite the lack of color glossies!

One wonders if this author's reputation might be a bit overblown,though these stories sure are interesting. They should appeal to everyone except romantics who like happy endings. Kafka's is not the type in a Harlequin Romance. Still, is he really THAT  great? Anyone who has had a mixup with the law, a gov't agency, who feels persecuted but can't figure how and where, and who likes earthbound sci-fi and old \\"Twilight Zone\\" shows will love this. No doubt Kafka has a sense of humor too, even if it seems a little too masochistic at times. The writing is darn good, probably better in the German. METAMORPHOSES seems a little too far out for me. But IN THE PENAL COLONY,and THE JUDGEMENT ARE ABSOLUTE MUST READS. You can pick other faves, and know you're reading the words of a genius, tormented father/victim and all.

Anyway, it's the story of a boy turning nine(ten?) who is getting ready for his upcoming birthday party when he falls on the street curb, and gets a bruised head,which is much worse than anyone thinks. Meanwhile his mother is busy at the local bakery giving the baker directions for the special cake. The family comes home, the boy's head aches and he passes out. At the hospital, the doctors' continually reassure his parents that the boy will be OK. Meanwhile, the Baker keeps calling the boy's mother,reminding her rather obnoxiously that the cake is ready...The hospital desciptions are harrowing, and so is the rest of the story,but,as in CATHEDRAL, there is redemption at the very end,when the Baker spills his guts out to the grieving parents..Very touching indeed!

Having read and discussed this one in a book club a while back, I can say I probably would never have finished, except for the discussion group. Yes, the narrative does flow like a clear river most of the time, but gets bogged down like the terrible cholera epidemic mentioned in the title...Perhaps I'm just the jaded type, in that reading about a man obsessed with a woman for over fifty years, constantly getting shot down and blown off, seems to this reader an exercise in masochistic futility..Still, it's easy to see how this book earned it's classic status, even if there are probably hundreds (thousands?) of other beautifully done love stories that don't get lost in dense quicksand like this one, or that are not nearly as well known.	2002-01-16

After all, this legendary person published it at the age of 90. Now she is celebrating her 99th birthday. Frankly,most of us will never live a life like this, and continue as we approach 100 years. It's easy to criticize people like Leni Riefenstahl, and her association with the Hitler gang. What would each of us done in a similar situation? Especially in the late 1930's when many, including our own hero C. Lindbergh, were infatuated with the German leader and his movement. In fact, her comments on Hitler ring true.She says she often took notes of their conversations,and always remembered everything he said.Read pp.105-108 on her first meeting with Hitler, and pp. 210-211 on their discussions about Paris and religion...She was a little like Albert Speer,both artists caught in the mystifying web of the Fuhrer, and the idea of rebuilding and remaking Germany, with themselves as leading lights. Whatever personal demons she fought then and later, she continued to live with amazing zeal and wonder of life. In her 70's she travelled to Africa meeting and photographing Nubian tribes. She was still snorkeling into her late 80's...Yes, much of the book drags, and she is showing herself in the best light, which most of us would tend to do. But all in all,an amazing life, and interesting,if overlong, book.	2002-01-16

Yes, I've read this many times,since high school, where it seemed like a force fed waste of time.I never knew the types described in this book then.Like &quot;Bond Business&quot; Nick,a business based on trading money (update to Tom Wolfe'S BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES,which has many similarities to THE GREAT GATSBY!) But, that was a long time ago. Usually I breezed thru it,but recently I gave it a more serious try, and found it to be just as great as they say! Why? Simply, because the characters are incredibly true to life. I've met Tom Buchanan types so many times it makes me want to (I won't say here.) The world is full of arrogant smart alecks who never had to do a thing on their own,and who look down their nose at their supposed &quot;inferiors&quot;. And Daisy...How many shallow,money grubbing,self obsessed young ladies are there like this? One wonders what Gatsby saw in her too,but that's probably the point. You know, the ones who get thrilled by looking at dozens of colored shorts in a wardrobe, as she does with Gatsby. Both types really care for nothing except themselves and their little toys. FS Fitzgerald probably knew hundreds like this...Now the Gatsby character is more unique and refreshing,even if he is dull.The self made guy who may have made his money under shady conditions. Then again,how about the dot-com millionaire rage of recent memory, and the way the world and the media were lapping it up. Now, the Enron fiasco where it's obvious the bigshots could care less about anything other than lining their own pockets at everyone else's expense.A little like Tom perhaps. But Gatsby seemed to have a heart, shallow as he may have been. And the New York 1920's locale rings true too...This novel easily can be read by a 15 year old,even though his life experience will not be able to understand it. And an 80 year old can appreciate it too. If Joyce's ULYSSES was the best novel of the century, how many can figure it out?. Really, almost no one! Same with most others on the list,like say Faulkner.ULYSSES was not about what FSF called &quot;the bitch goddess success&quot; which is what THE GREAT GATSBY is about...As far as another reviewer here questioning what the final line meant..ie &quot;So we beat on,boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past&quot;...Surely it was THE GREAT GATSBY'S obsession with the past,even as the future beats away, and Daisy's disappearance from the past into the present, that was responsible for his terrible demise at the end!! Tell your Professor that's the obvious answer to his 20 year question..We should each learn to deal with our own past darknesses. The tragedy of a person like Gatsby is that it becomes an obsession resulting in a sad ending...Also, this is without question a monument to the language, the second reason it is such a classic.rs on the list,like say Faulkner.ULYSSES was not about what FSF called &quot;the bitch goddess success&quot; which is what THE GREAT GATSBY is about...As far as another reviewer here questioning what the final line meant..ie &quot;So we beat on,boats against the current,borne back ceaselessly into the past&quot;...Surely it was THE GREAT GATSBY'S obsession with the past,even as the future beats away, and Daisy's disappearance from the past into the present, that was responsible for his terrible demise at the end!!

He seems a little too obsessed with getting a &quot;clean kill&quot; as he and his friends go big game hunting. Hunter bloodlust is not my idea of a good time. Still, as always in such a Master, there are always worthwhile sections, including the etchings of wildwife scenes,even if these are not done by the author. He does present some nice prose rhythms of the African wilderness, and the spectacular wildlife there amid the great outdoors. Plus he has some interesting comments on American, and world, literature, praising Mark Twain and Thomas Mann to the sky. No one could argue with him there. Anyway, some of his Africa/Big Game short stories are much better. I prefer two contemporary(1930's) women writers to EH as African Guides: Isack Dineson (OUT OF AFRICA etc), and Beryl Markham (WEST WITH THE NIGHT). Even the greatest artists have their duller moments. So does Papa here!	2002-01-15

Over about the past 30 years, I have trekked thru just about all the Hemingway oevrue, including the usually panned posthumous works. Yes, there are some great moments here, especially the very last line, if you can get that far. The journeys thru Spain, the bullfights, the semi-deadened characters, some beautiful set pieces make this worthwhile, but in the end it becomes practicaly one drunken/eating escapade after the other.Sure the writing at times is beautiful. As someone else says here,and I agree, THE GREAT GATSBY is better written,more timeless, and about America then and now. As for 1920's expatriots in Paris, Hem's much later collection, A MOVABLE FEAST is, I think ,far superior,witty and amusing, and you can tell simply by the title, not desolate like this one. Still, SUN ALSO RISES has a lot to say,believable characters, and characterizations,despite the seemingly neverending alcoholic binges. It's just not the great writer's best.Perhaps that's to be expected, given that he wrote this at about age 26!!	2002-01-14

I admit that I often find this great writer too dense and slow moving,and at times have put down a couple (eg.THE PERFECT SPY) before finishing them, even though the language is always wondrous...Maybe just too hard for me! So I can say I've read this one twice with nary a stumble. It's a first person narrative about a retired Brit spy(Tim) whose old pal(Larry) seems to have stolen his girl,and ended up in the Caucasus region between Russia and Iran. The book consists of LeCarre's usual assortment of eccentrics, revolutionaries, burnt out cases (as Tim himself is), political refugees, subversives,manipulators, and so on in a region of dissent and upheaval, sometimes in the news, but usually perhaps ignored even now. Which is what makes this book even more interesting today. The ruggedness of the terrain produces some tough people(s), and Mr. LeCarre does an expert job at interweaving all these straying elements into a fine,readable,and contemporary yarn. Worth the effort!	2002-01-14

There are many outstanding reviews here on Amazon about this terrific book,so I'll just add a few points that may not have been covered already. With Mr. Morris' recent THEODORE REX, I quickly reread this one, and it was as good the second as the first time. The beginnings are really something, and an inspiration to all, given that TR was born sickly and started the strenuous life at a very early age, in part due to his impressive father. True, it does not hurt to be from a very well off family. His youthful biology experiments are wonderfully described, as young TR became virtually a one-boy laboratory,interested in any and all things. He was awed by his youthful travels in Egypt analyzing the  multitudes of flora and fauna now within view. Ditto for the ancient architechural wonders. His years at Harvard are noted,and his famous  personality as child and dynamo are noted not for the last time, since even his associates later in the White House noted the same thing...Anyway, a long book, but amusing,thoughtful, dynamic, and wondrous, just as TR was, and Mr. Morris probably is as well.. at least when writing about this tornado of a figure!!	2002-01-14

It is a beautifully written true to life story in every way, more so to me now than when I first read it, I think in 9th grade a long time ago. It is a story of the nobility of life,yes again, the famous &quot;grace under pressure&quot;. Just thinking about it you can imagine being alone on a small fishing boat out there plugging away, catching the great fish, and then losing him to the carnivores beneath the surface.

Perhaps holing up somewhere will keep them from from freezing to death, and hopefully the enemy is nowhere near. This strategy backfires when they realize that Germans have found them.

But the late 60's student battles (mainly verbal), and other periods are fine too. The one common thread seems to be soccer, be it between Germany and it's European rivals,or between the DDR and the Federal Republic later. Mr. Grass really humanizes his nation's recent past, especially in his way of telling 100 unique tales by 100 unique narrators. Simply put, a final crown for the 1999 Nobel Winner.

This is the culmination of a scholarly genius' work after 70 years of study and investigation. Notably, this great book can be read by even the layman with an interest in the western world since 1500, and going back earlier. The design is terrific with the best aspects of a good college textbook, in that appropriate quotes are on many pages,which clarify the points discussed. Also forward (&lt;),and backward (&gt;)pages on the subject are frequent to encourage browsing. Unlike textbooks, FROM DAWN TO DECADENCE supplies wry wit and humor throughout to keep you chuckling and help to turn the pages. The vast cultural history of the West (1500-2000) is covered, and you'll surely find your own favorite parts. I especially liked the Luther, Erasmus Reformation section; Oliver Cromwell; the French Revolution, Napoleon, and especially the scientific journey and exploration of Eqypt, and CROSS SECTION; CHICAGO. The ending pages may be a bit overly-political and editorial for some,though I found his comments on contemporary society illuminating. It helps that I agree with the Professor. He says the current pop scene is loaded with obscenities and junk,mentioning names of bands for youth;&quot;Garbage&quot;, the &quot;Sex Pistols&quot;, &quot;Grateful Dead&quot;. etc. You may consider him an old reactionary, but at the age of 92, Professor Barzun has written one of the great treatises ever.

I had read Mann (MAGIC MOUNTAIN),Musil (MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES), WAS AMAZED, GAVE THIS ONE A SHOT. A lot is very slow going,but it's true this is a book that really makes you appreciate beauty, and frankly be glad that you (I) have eyes and ears. Most people, it seems, go thru life without really bothering to appreciate the everyday beauties that are all around us,corny as that seems. Walk around your neighborhood some evening.How many people will be strolling outside enchanted at the the stars/heavens? For every one,there are probably a thousand watching an obnoxious sit-com with canned laughter. You see, a great artist like Proust makes us look at the world in this way. Walk into even a do-it-yourself clothing shop,and notice all the patterns. Most of us barely pay attention. Proust' ways of seeing,and describing are like  any  great painter. He often invokes Vermeer, a fair comparison.He is awed by cathedrals,landscapes,you name it. And his discussions of the Great War, including some admiration for German soldiers, are a surprise. Yes, it goes on and on,and I could not make the effort now,except to browse thru it. BTW, I prefer Mann and Musil, who seem to have a better story line,and stringer narrative. Marcel's mother complex,and all the super-long interrelationships and descriptions may put you off, for good reason,but even just browsing thru this shows you this fellow had phenomenal powers of observation,even forgetting all the rest of the greatness of this wondrous, if boring at times, work of art.	2002-01-01

This is a brilliant university-employed astro-physicist who seems to live to explore the outer realms of the universe, thru it's telescope. Amis explores, thru the first person in the words of this cynical/lovable female bull of a detective, the recent life of this seeming Botticelli-like creation,who has devoted her life to creation itself, and it's underpinnings. A pretty large subject to write about in only 175 pages. This tortured ride thru outer/inner space, and the gritty streets of a large US city, was so outrageous I read it three times. Amis goes right for the throat,gut,and heart of the matter,and largely succeeds,though at times the gruesomeness of this journey may make you want to take a rest. The world of cadavers, burnt-out urban police, astronomy, and a lot more will make this a rough and tumble ride. The final resolution may be weak, but crazier things have happened.	2002-01-01

From Bobby Sox fave to Sultan of Swoon to the Fall and Great Comeback, it is just about all here, except for the very last years from the mid-1990's to the end. This volume is a collection of essays surveying the vast realm of an incredible career. The clear links between his peerless Capitol recordings,and his own life are explained,as are the demanding sessions themselves, his always being in charge with a lot of help from his friends. Every piece here is worthwhile, my favorite being Gay Talese's FRANK SINATRA HAS A COLD (1966)To quote:&quot;Sinatra with a cold is Picasso without paint,Ferrari without fuel..A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way,send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President can, suddenly sick, shake the national economy.&quot;  A great fun of a read! Not for Frank fanatics only.	2001-12-22

If you prefer intentional obscufucation, then Mr. Joyce will help. Endless descriptions of interiors, and mother anxiety seem to permeate the latter. The first few paragraphs of MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES must be among the best descriptions of time and place ever written. And the plot is interesting, as the lagging Austrian-Hungarian before WWI tries to put on a better emperor's celebration than it's huge German cousin/neighbor to the north, a gesture we can tell will be futile from the git-go. Ulrich, the main character is a well-bred 30ish man about town who is dragged into this affair,perhaps against his better judgement.In a novel this vast, there are characters to match,including a seemingly normal working man who is also a mass murderer, and the object of gossip and news...The author draws you into this vast Vienna metropolis with  a steady hand, though his near-constant philosophical digressions may tend to put you to sleep at times.Still, go for it. It's one of those novels you can always return to. In fact, that's just what I've done now for 25 years, after my first reading.	2001-12-22

Just about all of Mr. McDonald's novels deal with long lost family members,who may be dead and buried,living a new life hiding their past, or some similar predicament.The relatives want to somehow find the whereabouts of this clansman, and turn to Lew Archer,PI. The author knows how to turn all the corners at high speeds,leaving the reader baffled when the first definite victim appears. It's always a high flying ride as  Archer, the compassionate but hard-boiled detective, uses his subtle charm to finally unmask the strange doings, always in a contemporary setting,circa 1940-1976,his writing years. The GALTON case is my personal favorite,and Mr. MacDonald's beautifully crafted novel may initiate you into a mild addiction to his special family based mysteries, usually based in the Los Angeles area.	2001-12-22

Yes, I know the author is a conservative.All the figures in this book may be subject to debate, but no one can doubt the massive paranoia of the Soviet leader during the 1930's, as described here. The whole workings of a police state are right here,including the KGB chiefs who, after doing their dirty work, would then disappear. For pure sinister deviousness, this book is in a class by itself. &quot;Enemies of the people&quot; could be anywhere,and even children were encouraged to &quot;report&quot; on their parents. The fact is that Soviet Russia in the 1930's was much more ruthless to it's own (so-called &quot;counter-revolutionaries)citizens than Germany, which was a much more technologically  advanced nation,and with a much lower poverty level. The infamous Moscow Trials were only a tiny fraction of the whole mess.A great read!!	2001-12-22

I first read this in the 9th grade, a long time ago,and have checked into it often since then. Looking back,the history of Hitler's ideas are clearly explained,and anti-semitism in Europe had a long,sordid history way before anyone had heard of Hitler. His rise to power,ideas,and  plans are shown to have been clear very early on with MEIN KAMPF, a book not read or taken seriously by enough people. I thought the blackmailing of Generals Blomberg and Fritsch in 1937 was a highlight,since that episode has often been overlooked elsewhere. The planning for the attack on Poland (9/1/39) is well done,as is the British and French response. The actions of the &quot;Supreme Warlord&quot; throughout the war are so well described that it's easy now (without looking at the book)to remember Mr. Shirer's account.And the horrors of the death camps are made as clear as can be. My only perhaps negative remembrance,after having read many volumes on this subject, seems to be that Mr. Shirer did not adequately explain the appeal of this ex-corporal on a great,modern nation. He does not really explain the complexity of the Fuehrer, a many faceted individual, not just the carpet-eating, raving, single-testicled person of myth. No one gets to such a position in the world,starting out from nowhere, without a dynamic side. In short, it seems Hitler's personal magnetism,even charm,his photographic memory, his seeming amazing ability to make the right decisions, even after looking into the abyss, made him a fascinating figure for many,who followed him to the bitter end. It seems that Mr. Shirer only paints the monster and not the whole man, and perhaps that does not really explain all the horrors that rest on the shoulders of this person and his lieutenants,and followers.	2001-12-22

This collection may be the best intro to the GREATEST 20th Century Author..(OK, you may not agree.) Much of Mann is difficult and dense,even for me, a longtime devotee. In this collection, start off with MARIO, a superior look at the sacred and profane. We find a German tourist and his young family in Italy going into a seemingly harmless carnival-type show. The author's portrait of the innocent young is itself worth the entire book,their enchantment at the acts,until an ugly mesmorist makes his appearance performing seemingly impossible tricks on members of the crowd. Slowly, the innocent crowd has been hooked, the children awed by the whole thing, until the final,inevitable end. Reading this,I thought,&quot;Are there really people out there who can perform such acts?&quot; Who knows, but this story is surely a classic,along with the six others, mainly described in other reviews.	2001-12-20

There is nothing with Mr. Manchester's name on it that's not the absolute top, anyway. But this one should be on everyone's list,especially perhaps, those who admit their understanding of US history may be a bit superficial, or whose last history reading was in high school. Just about everything is mentioned (maybe not,that would be impossible) from unions in &quot;The Cruelist Years&quot; to the rise of FDR,including the fact,sometimes forgotten now, that at the time there were absolutely venomous FDR haters in the USA, people not above spreading rumors that he and/or Eleanor, were syphilitics. This book moves  through Hitler, the War, the Cold War, Truman,General Motors, the McCarthy and Ike Years...all the way to Nixon and McGovern in 1972. Many chapters begin with a newspaper like montage,outlining coming events. Plus, the author does not miss home life, high,middle, and low culture, you name it. He keeps the reader interested all the way, by also making you feel almost as if you are right there,participating in  conversations between,say, senators,or the joint chiefs. And his wry wit will keep you smiling when he moves on after some serious business. The other reviews here say everything else I would want to, so I'll finish by strongly recommending this work,too!	2001-12-17

This will shatter some of our high blown and high falutin' images we like to say about ourselves. Yes, we were on the right side for sure. But the general nastiness of war, this war, any war, should not be hidden under a flag either. For many soldiers, the worst enemy was their own commanding officers. Of course, this is true for the other belligerents too. And the German soldiers were fighting for their own cause too, and believed they were on the side of truth and justice. Really, only near the very end, when the realities of the concentration camps became fully known, did just about everyone,including the Germans,realize that theirs was the wrong cause. Mr. Fussell says that nearly every American soldier,in the beginning,learned the hard way that the Germans actually were often much better equiped,clothed,and trained,and  had better weapons,guns,tanks. Only later did we remedy this bad situation, sometimes after paying a steep price. Yes, war is hell!	2001-12-17

Mr. Mitchell's lazer beam ray into just about every nook and cranny of Manhatten from around 1930 to the early 1960's, will make you wish you were his sidekick. Originally a Southerner,his reporting and stories makes us believe that outsiders, who are curious about everything in their new surroundings, may be the ones who know it best. And his empathy for even those who appear the lowest in the social stratum shows that there is something special in all of us. My personal favorite is hearing the police detective describe some of the shady tricks that some gypsies, ususally recently from Europe, were up to in getting certain naive homemakers to part with their money. Some con game!! But every yarn is true and enjoyable.

I've read this one twice,and probably my only criticism is that Ms. Tartt should have had a better editor.Then again, I wasn't writing top of the line novels at her age (and still haven't)!The sense of isolated young scholars in a near-hermetically wintry sealed community reminded me a little of Hesse and Mann,both among the huge assortment of authors she probably has breezed through. The immaturity and petty bickering of the young collegiates,though probably universal, did get on my nerves a bit, as they ran through the whole work. But since this is a world the author surely knows, she writes from first hand experience,I'm sure. The philosphical chit-chat was a lot of fun too, even if again overdone. But the sense of college life was generally right on target. The first murder,during a depraved outdoor spree, meant to emulate the ancient Greeks,may not be too convincing,but stranger things have happened.The coverups are diabolically clever,but these are clever people who commit them. Let's see if Ms. Tartt can top this the next go around,and maybe find a better editor.	2001-12-17

There are some fine reviews here already. This must be the BEST Hemingway collection out there,starting with the preface by John, Patrick, and Gregory Hemingway. Honestly, it is difficult in the TV-age perhaps for many to appreciate what Hem meant to his generation. There seems to be no author alive (at least American) who represents his era like EH. It may be that some of his novels today may seem a little dated (&quot;Sun Also Rises&quot;,&quot;Green Hills&quot;, &quot;Across the River&quot;-which was panned in the 50's, even &quot;Old Man in the Sea&quot;), but his best stories will always stand the test of time. The first piece here &quot;The Short Happy Life...&quot; I found truly startling long ago,and still do. Who else could describe such a bitter marriage in a big game hunting environment? Not to mention, imagining how animals think! Even a very short piece like &quot;The Killers&quot; has been made into at least two semi-classic movies. And is there a better description of a young man alone in the woods than &quot;Big Hearted River&quot;? Just about all of EH's lifetime interests are here,from Indians in Michigan, the downtrodden with a heart of gold,skiing in the Alps, the struggles of newly weds, father and son relationships, the mindless boredom of war, you name it, the list goes on...This is the best book by our greatest writer, and is almost a necessity for anyone of any age!	2001-12-15

Anyone can drive through, visit, and even live in a great city, and state too, without really knowing how it came to look and be that way. Mr. Moses was a major player in building the UN headquarters, the 1964 World's Fair, Shea Stadium,Lincoln Center,Throgs Neck Bridge, NYstate parkways,the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Orchard and Jones Beaches,on and on. He even helped design the signs at the beaches,and the dancing elephant sculptures at Central Park zoo.

Boy, has Mr. Giddins done some job here! And to think he stops in 1940,just before the war, and Bing's greatest period. When all those &quot;Best of the Century&quot; lists came up a while back,it seemed that Bing really got the short shrift. Every Christmas he becomes almost as ubiquious as a tree, and then fades away just as quickly.During the depression years, it is said, Mr. Crosby was almost as famous and beloved as FDR himself (and without the President's hysterical enemies). Everyone knew his voice,singing or speaking, everyone with a radio that is,and during this period the radio was like TV and radio today.And Bing's appeal was not limitted to this or that age group,race,income ,what have you. He was recording with Louis Armstrong, when Elvis was in the cradle.(Elvis often gets credit for breaking musical racial barriers.) He was casually referred to as &quot;Everyone's Uncle&quot;. His list of hits surpassed even the Beatles a generation later. Did you know he was color-blind? That explains his often odd (not color coordinated) apparel.He could drive because of the position the 3 shaded electric lights have (had). And he was a star baseball player in his day...But he hit it bigger than even Babe Ruth,and lasted a lot longer!! A terrific bio,it does require an effort and is rather long...Bing's last words while on a golf course in Spain: &quot;Well, fellows, thanks for a great game of golf&quot;...Now, it seems clear that many of his recordings may not hold up too well,especially compared to Sinatra who came later.(Bing on Frank:&quot;He has a voice that comes only once a lifetime.Why did it have to be in mine?&quot;) Still, his Christmas movies and recording legacy will be eternal. Long Live Bing!!	2001-12-10

I admit that I tried some of Mr. Updike over the years,and never even made it to  first base. It seemed he was way overpraised.But then I chanced upon IN THE BEAUTY OF THE LILIES. I'm glad I did.Mr. Updike rolls out a yarn here that seems to cover just about the entire American 20th century. All the characters are true to life, from the factory owners to the loyal union men in the beginning,and especially the Wilmot family over several generations.His sense of time and place is perfect. Paterson,NJ, makes a fine central location as the silk capital of the USA. A Methodist minister loses his faith,startling his wife, since he could lose his central position in the community. The good minister visits the church elder,and what follows may be the best discussion of religious faith in fiction. But this churchman cannot go on acting against his beliefs (make that non-beliefs). So he moves,his family fortunes go into decline,as predicted by his wife,and he attempts to sell encyclopedias to the mainly working class blue collar community...Now,all this is woven around together as in a movie reel,since the Hollywood Dream Machine plays a strong role throughout the novel.As the future unfolds,many other interesting segments follow,like the honeymoon in Philadelphia, the honeymooners stay in the grand Belleview Hotel, and their sense of being overwhelmed by this great city.Nice plug for a sometimes neglected great American city! This book is like unfolding a huge and beautiful tapestry that slowly turns into a magic carpet ride. A young lady family member in the 1930's becomes a very famous actress,and Mr. Updike gives wondrous descriptions of this event. Her son becomes a bit strange,and in searching for something,some faith that his forbear had long ago lost,ends up in an even stranger cult.Here the book may fall off slightly. Nonetheless,you'll keep turning the pages to the very end. The last line: &quot;The children&quot;. Maybe I'll grab my copy, and give it a second go around!	2001-12-08

It makes well researched and amusing reading,and is to me the finest book on popular music ever written.It helps to read an obviously great book when you agree with about 95% of his own editorializing. Every era of Mr.Sinatra's recording career,even past Duets II,and going into his last ,sometimes awkward,concerts is covered.If you want gossip,go elsewhere.Mr. Friedwald covers the personalities,from Stordahl,Riddle,May,Jenkins, and  all the rest,and when you finish this book you'll feel the incredible energy, fun,and friendship that made these recordings. The fact is that Frank's  canon is so great that some of my favorite recordings are not even mentioned in the index. Even Mr. Friedwald can't cover everything I guess.It's true that there are some snide comments that Mr Friedwald has for other performers,and his general contempt for rock and roll is obvious.I usually chuckled reading them since it was nice to read that the author and I agreed on the obvious. The fact is that anyone who actually knows Frank's best, and has made such an effort,must in general agree with Mr. Friedwald. For no one from the the rock era has anywhere near the oeuvre that Frank has.And in truth, the general quality of popular culture,especially music,has been in an abysmal decline for about 40 years, hopefully bottoming in the &quot;Rap&quot; era...This work is also a great reference,and will provide cultural enlightenment for many years to come.	2001-12-06

As others here say,if you want to learn of the western world circa 1907-1915,(and in 2001),this novel just about covers it all.Descriptions of the weather,mountains,courting games, time,biology,and yes the meaning of it all, plus just about anything else,including some real eccentrics.Also,don't miss the greatest picaresque yarn of them all,the full length version of &quot;Confessions of Felix Krull-Confidence Man&quot;,finished when the great writer was 75,40 years after it was originally written as short story.This is a hilarious farce written by the 20th century's greatest author.(In my humble opinion,this is simply indisputable)Also, if you like Saul Bellow,you'll also greatly appreciate Mann!!Their word wizardry,intellectual prowess,and wry humor are very similar.	2001-11-27
