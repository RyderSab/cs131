Nice addition to, but not my favorite of, the series.  <BR>The flip-flopping of chapters from past to present took a while to get used to and while interesting is not a style I hope Mr. Saylor continues in the next book.	2002-05-27

Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.  <br />How could there have been a 12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books?  How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant?  Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over?  Where is the plot, the suspense, the action?  <br />I do not recommend buying this book, get on the waiting list at the library.	2002-05-07

Sorcerer's Apprentice is worthy of this designation.  Interesting, entertaining, read-aloud, tell-your-friends type worthy.  Buy, Read, Enjoy.	2002-04-25

What a sad, pitiful, disfunctional family.  Even for a work of fiction this is stretching things a bit.  The plot is unbelievable (even more so than Broken Days) and is basically a repeat of the previous addition to the series.  If you would like to see how the trilogy ends - get the book from the library, do not waste the money and purchase it.	2002-02-27

Everyone seems to be a charicature, not a true person.  Rather boring, would not recommend.<br />Little Black Princess is much more enjoyable, you care for Bett-Bett and learn very interesting things concerning the culture at that time.  Would recommend.	2002-02-07

I think it would be enjoyed more by older readers (13+)than younger as it does not have as much &quot;action&quot; as the other books.  This book has a more philosophical bent.  The book is not one I would buy, I recommend getting it from the library instead.  <BR>I find it very very hard to believe that the parents in the story would actualy get divorced, live separately - sure, but divorce in that day and age - no.	2002-01-07

It was rather repetative in this sense.	2002-01-05
