The two find shelter in an inn that has been closed for the Christmas Holiday.  Over the next few days, while cooking together, talking about literature, having snowball fights and building snowmen, the two realize they are very attracted to each other and consummate their relationship. <br /> <br />Parting ways once the snow clears, Frances returns to her job in Bath as a school teacher while Lucius returns to London to propose to the woman everyone expects him to marry. <br /> <br />But contrived circumstances reunite the pair where Lucius discovers that Frances is a world class singer.  Determined to rescue her from her boring dreary life as a teacher, Lucius encourages her singing. <br /> <br />What follows is a series of chapters with Lucius pursuing and Frances retreating because there is some big secret in her past. <br /> <br />The only thing that saves this book from being a dreary bore is the fact that Mary Balogh is a talented writer.  For the most part though, this is a by-the-numbers-plot with a by-the-numbers romance.  It was pleasant enough but when the big secret from the past is finally revealed it is rather a let-down. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, it is rather glaring that this is a contemporary novel disguised as a regency.  It has a very \\"modern\\" feel that seems out of place.	2005-08-13

For one thing, the pacing seemed all off.  The writer has talent.  She actually does know how to write.  My problem with the story is it dragged in some (well many) places and then seemed sped up and disjointed in others. <br /> <br />First I thought the relationship between the two main characters started too quicky (they were ready to kiss each other from the moment they met) and then, weirdly, went nowhere.  It didn't seem to progress.  Yes, they talked about how much they meant to each other and how they really felt like they wanted to spend their lives together but all I could do was ask \\"well, why?\\"  To me, there wasn't a great build up and therefore the pay-off is just 'meh'.   <br /> <br />Since this is an IR romance, I know that the author needs to make a decision of either confroting the issue or ignoring it. In this book, the issue was confronted, but at times I felt as if I were being bludgeoned or lectured at.  I don't mind making racial factors a roadblock to a relationship going forward, but I would like for the issues to be raised organically, more naturally.  The author just seemed to throw incidents at the couple to create a plot point for discussion of some characters' uneasiness with IR dating. <br /> <br />Also, the editing of this book was horrid.  There'd be whole passages in italics, like someone forgot to close a tag.  Also, there'd be weird scene shifts.  In one paragraph the couple was at a dinner party and in the very next paragraph they were somewhere completely different a couple of days later.  There was no transitioning.  Very disorienting. <br /> <br />I don't recommend.	2005-08-11

Was it the beautiful woman seen leaving the good Dr.'s premises right before his death?  Was Will junior's wife involved? <br /> <br />Through police procedure Eve and her trusty band of sidekicks (Peabody, McNabb, Feeney, Baxter, et. al) begin to delve into the background of the two doctors and find more than they bargain for. <br /> <br />I was severely disappointed in the last Eve Dalls book.  I felt that Nora Roberts had drawn from a well that she had visited many times.  Not so this book.  If you're familiar with the series, you'll recognize another one of her favorite themes, the God-complected doctor.  But this one is nicely different from her others. <br /> <br />The book begins like many of the others: a murder happens, Eve investigates and calls in her team, and begins to throw around theories.  ABout half way through, this book takes off and doesn't look back. The story is tightly plotted and the mystery unravels with some great suspense and exciting revelations.  The core of the story is really quite creepy (but in a shivery good way) and the ending just downright popcorn chomping exciting! <br /> <br />Outside of the mystery, a secondary plot is Roarke and Eve are planning Thanksgiving dinner.  Roarke's Irish relatives come to visit and they've invited the whole gang (including Charles the LC and Crack, the owner of the Down and Dirty).  My one regret about the whole story is that we don't get to see that dinner happen.  <br /> <br />Excellent.	2005-08-11

When you're reading a good, fast-paced, well written book you can overlook a lot. But while reading a boring book, your mind has a lot of time to dwell on little nitpicky things. Like, how many times can a person smolder?  The word \\"smolder\\" or \\"smoldering\\" was used ad nauseum throughout this book.  I get it that Jillian and Harrison were hot for each other but I am sure the word \\"smolder\\" has some synonyms. <br /> <br />And then there was the fact that people were always screaming at each other in this book.  Characters didn't talk, reply, or just say things to each other.  No, they would \\"practically scream\\" or \\"rage\\" or \\"roar\\".  <br /> <br />I was also turned off by the weird malapropisms.  At one point Jillian was \\"withering\\" in passion.  Also Harrison's mother was referred to as a \\"Southern Bell\\".  I could go on but what is the point?	2005-08-06

The Empress Laseen has outlawed Whiskyjack, the Bridgeburners, and Dujek Onearm after their failure to capture the jeweled city of Darujistan. The seasoned soldiers are not long out of work. On the continent of Genabackis there is word of a terrifying new threat. A deranged prophet known as the Pannion Seer is on the march with a massive army of powerful mages, undead lethal warriors and thousands of cannibalistic zealots. He has set his sights on the city of Capustan to conquer the city and for its citizens to serve as food for his ravening hordes. <br />Realizing that the city's lone defenders, The Grey Swords, are woefully outmatched, Whiskeyjack and Dujek offer assistance. Because there are other more powerful forces propelling the Pannion, former enemies of the Malazans also offer alliance. The Warlord Caladan Brood and the mysterious Tiste Andii Anomander Rake march with WhiskeyJack and Dujek to Capustan amidst an uneasy truce. <br /> <br />In the midst of this, the child, Silverfox is aging at a rapid rate as she attempts to fulfill her destiny. Ganoes Paran learns the price of having walked within the sword Dragnipur, a tribe is reunited with their Gods, an ancient wrong is righted, ordinary people become heroic, heroes are shown that they are all too human and a mortal man attempts to save a God. <br /> <br />Right from the start in the first book where we are plopped in the middle of a devastating war and see a young girl possessed with the spirit of a deadly assassin, we are immediately wrapped up in the lives and fortunes of a great many interesting people. There is Whiskeyjack the beloved leader, who is weary of war and politics. There is Tattersail the clever mage whose reincarnation comes at a devastating price. There is Ganoes Paran , once a pawn to be played, becomes a master of the game. There is the fat, affable Kruppe who confounds everyone he meets. There isthe mysterious (and wonderfully monikered) Anomander Rake, who has untold powers and hinted at sorrow. There is Empress Laseen, who may not be as evil as we think. And there is Quick Ben, who has many surprises up his sleeve. <br /> <br />Although the subject matter of bloody, horrible war (along with rape, torture, cannibalism and possible world destruction) can be quite heavy, there are still glimpses of humor and wonder in his writing. I like the world he has built. I like the deep history that we learn as the stories progress. I like the idea of the Deck of Dragons where the hierarchy of Gods manifests itself in a deck of cards. And I especially like the fact that while I am pretty sure whom to root for, I am not always sure whom I should root against. Even the seemingly unsympathetic characters seem to have good reasons to do what they do. <br /> <br />While I did read the books in order, I found that I actually had to go back and reread the first book in order to bring myself up to speed for this third one. The second book takes a bit of a detour and, rather than picking up right where the first book left off, it instead follows the story of Ganoes Paran's sister, Felisin and her travels in the deserts of the Seven Cities. While this was a bit of interruption in the action, it does whet the appetite for the eventual reunion of the two siblings both of whom have undergone both physical and metaphysical changes. <br />	2005-01-23

I am sorry, she just did not resonate with me.  She was too everything.  Too slick, too loud, too sarcastic, too mouthy etc. <br /> <br />Second, I didn't think she and Mike had any chemistry whatsoever. So far we've had some excellent matches whose chemistry just leapt off the pages (Teri/Stan, Tom/Kelly, Nils/Meg and of course Sam/Alyssa)  but this one just wasn't working.  I kept wondering why he liked her so much.  It totally took me out of the story. <br /> <br />Third, the flashback storyline wasn't even interesting at all. <br /> <br />But this book isn't a complete wash and that is all due to what I like to call the Redemption of a Former Seal Groupie named Mary Lou.  If you are a die-hard Sam/Alyssa fan, as I am, then Mary Lou is on par with Voldemort in the Harry Potter books.  She got knocked up on purpose to grab Sam just as he and Alyssa were finally, finally! getting it together.  She has problems with interracial romance, she's a whiner and full of self pity.  In short, she was a useless individual and nothing more than a roadblock to Sam and Alyssa's true love.  But in this book SB delves under the skin of Mary Lou and we find a flawed, three dimensional character. <br /> <br />Mary Lou does what is necessary to make a good character.  She grows.  She knows her faults, she's not apologetic but she tries.  She soul searches and she finally comes to the realization that you can't make someone love you.  I actually went from actively despising this character to liking her.  Her struggles and the subplot of the assasination attempt were what made this book even remotely readable. <br /> <br />Read the Mary Lou/assasination plot parts, ignore the rest.	2005-01-12

I loved this one the most because I actually liked all of the multiple storylines.  She usually does a main romance, a secondary one, the obligatory Sam/Alyssa angst (which i adore because I LOVE these two) and a WWII flashback.  In some of her other books there is at least one storyline I skim through because I think it steals valuable time from the better stuff.  Not this time.  I loved all the storylines.  <br /> <br />There are two reasons this one doesn't get 5 whole stars: <br /> <br />First is Ken Karmody.  This character has really changed from the previous books.  He wasn't very recognizeable as \\"Wildcard\\" Karmody.  He seemed way too normal in this one. <br /> <br />Second, I know that Sam and Alyssa's path to true love is already tortuous and doesn't need any other help to be even more torturous, but I was disappointed in the Max/Alyssa let's pretend we're together shenanigans.  It just seems so high school.  I think the heart-failure quotient for the Sam/Alyssa fans would've been really high if Max/Alyssa had actually, really tried to be together. Temporarily, of course. <br /> <br />But enough of my armchair fan-fic.  <br /> <br />Great book, great series.  Total recommendation!	2005-01-12

Devastated and afraid, Sarah grieves but eventually turns her attention toward the future.  She moves from Michigan to start all over again in Memphis, the place where she was born and her father now lives.  There she gets a job as a manager of a nursery/garden shop.  She quickly becomes friends with Roz, the enigmatic owner of the shop, her new boss and owner of Harper house where Stella lives as a condition of her employment..  She also becomes friend with Hayley, a somehow cousin of Roz's who shows up pregnant on Roz's doorstep. The three women bond, Stella embarks on a romance with a landscaper and there is a ghost haunting the place. <br /> <br />You can always count on Nora Roberts putting out one of her JD Robb titles(Visions in Death), a single title (Northern Lights) and trilogy title at least once a year and usually around the same time.  I used to be thrilled about this because there is no bigger bummer than a favorite author not being prolific enough to satisfy your need to read their new book(George R.R. Martin, I am speaking to you!).  But this time around I am not as satisfied with the results that I normally am.  I think \\"flat\\" is a very good adjective to describe this book.  Stella, Roz, Logan, Hayley even the ghost are all such `meh' creatures that the I had a very hard time getting involved or excited about any of them.  The romance between Stella and Logan wasn't very exciting and I can't even get worked up to anticipate the two follow ups.  This is a major change from her most recent \\"Key\\" trilogy where each book was a page turner and I couldn't wait to see how the story ended.  This one, I could barely get to the end of the first book. <br />	2004-11-14

A young woman is cleverly murdered, obviously by someone who is staying at the charming little inn run by her aunts.  Since Lizzie is also a guest at the inn, she is somewhat disturbed by the fact that she not only witnessed a murder but is sharing living space with the possible murderer.  Meanwhile her best friend's ne'er do well ex-husband has also arrived and is trying to patch things up.  Lizzie dislikes him and wonders if it is wishful thinking that he may be involved.  And then there is the attractive American detective that Lizzie keeps running into.  John Quinn is determined that Lizzie keep her nose out of a bona fide murder mystery before she gets herself killed. <br /> <br />This was a lovely story.  It had the true feel of one of those nice cozy little mysteries.  The book is excellently written and I like the idea of the budding romance between Lizzie and John.  I do wish that the author was a bit more descriptive of Lizzie.  I can't get a picture of her in my head.  And I thought the connections between all the people were a little too neat.  Also I found the way the murder was solved somewhat implausible, but I give that a pass.   <br /> <br />Overall, this was a good story.  I can't wait to read the next ones.	2004-11-12
US	53050096	R2XCDKEI7SOUJ	0060747730	372822109	A Personal Matter	Books	3	45	52	N	Y	Just okay	I read this book because of the great reviews it received on this site.  I thought it was an okay book but I didn't love it. <br /> <br />The Good: <br /> Technically, this was a well written book.  It has a polish and a sophistication that one does not normally find in an author's first book. <br /> <br />The dialogue was great.  It was snappy and witty and I could actually \\"hear\\" the characters talking. <br /> <br />The not so Good: <br />I didn't care about the characters.  Alayna was the most repressed, isolated character I have ever read about.  I didn't like her and I didn't sympathize with her.  Normally, this isn't such a bad thing as long as the character grows and changes during the course of the story.  I don't feel that Alayna's character grew at all during the story.  I think she was simply repositioned. <br /> <br />I actually liked Ben, but for a hotshot lawyer he didn't seem very hot-shot at all.  The follow through of the character did not live up to the set up. Of all the characters I think he was the one with the most depth. <br /> <br />I thought the secondary characters dragged down the story.  I appreciate secondary characters a lot in a story because they can really add texture, and a great supporting framework for the main characters.  But the father storyline and the sister storyline were distracting.  Maybe that is because the primary storyline of the romance between the two main characters just wasn't very engaging. <br /> <br />This takes me to my biggest disappointment.  I didn't feel as if these two characters connected to each other at all.  Alayna seemed so disdainful of Ben and white people in general that it seemed really bizarre that she would actually unbend enough to date a white guy let alone marry one.  I think the author tried to so hard to showcase Alayna as a strong black woman that she forgot to show how even a strong black woman becomes vulnerable in love.  Alayna never became vulnerable in my opinion.  So  much so, that Ifound myself wondering why did Ben even bother.  <br /> <br />As I got toward the end of the book I kept expecting wondering how the heck they'd get it together and become a couple.  Alas, it was a quick dnouement where everything happened all at once.  I wish the book had a bit more depth and a lot more emotion.	2004-11-12

I bought the first one the minute it was published and have religiously read them since.  But I have to admit this book did not hook me.  If this were the first In Death book, I'd think it completely rocked.  But it is like, what,  the 19th and we've read this story before.   <br /> <br />A serial killer with Mommy issues - check. <br />A member of Eve's inner circle gets seriously hurt and Eve blames herself - check. <br />Eve gives Nadine an exclusive interview and taunts the killer - check <br />Eve puts herself out as possible bait - check <br />Eve is confronted with a person who is raped and has nightmares after - check <br />Even consults with Dr. Mira and gets a spot on profile - check <br /> <br /> <br />I  do admit that the little twist with the psychic in the end was good, but overall I was, dare I say it...bored.  And I don't even want to get into the fact that yet again the perp was a serial killer.  How many serial killers does one woman have to confront in a 3-year period?  I wish Eve would get just plain old NYPD Blue type cases once in awhile.  <br /> <br />I hate giving this series a bad review because I do like the characters, and I can go back and reread the previous books with joy, but I think she completely phoned this one in and that is a shame because now that the books are being published in hard cover they should be getting better. <br /> <br />So disappointed. <br />	2004-11-11

Over the last 5 or so books that featured his siblings, Balogh had painted a very consisted picture of Wulf.  He was a very controlled, icy, arrogant member of the peerage who held and wielded a lot of power.  He doesn't suffer fools gladly and he is the undisputed ruler of his household.  Yet he clearly loves his family and has deeply felt (and closely held) emotions. <br /> <br />Enter the widow Christine Derrick who is always laughing, full of life and makes a complete and total spectacle of herself.  She is poor and her dead husband's relatives dislike her because apparently she had something to do with his death.  The two meet at a house party that neither wants to actually be at. They butt heads, she doesn't treat him with proper respect.  Other people look down their nose at her.  And Wulf reluctantly, despite himself, falls in love. <br /> <br />I thought this was a delightful book.  I wondered how MB would unbend Wulf enough to show him fall in love.  Well she did it by building on the foundation of the character that she had introduced us to over the previous books.  Wulf doesn't unbend, he stays Wulf.  Instead of changing him, she delves deeper under the surface and lets us peek into the inner person.  It makes for an effective and sweet and sexy love story.  I think this one replaces the Judith/Rannulf story as my favorite of the series. <br />	2004-11-11

And Merry's life arc is coming perilously close to Anita's as she takes more people under her wing each book and gains bright new and shiny powers each book. <br />Fine we know the Fey are very open about sex.  I don't care about sex.  Let everyone have sex!  Just also let there be some kind of story that makes it worth my while.  Where's Cel?  Isn't Merry a detective?  Why doesn't she solve cases?

US	53050096	RWHG3A70ECDPZ	0399151540	645136087	Divided in Death	Books	4	91	92	N	Y	Always good to see Eve and Roarke again	A man and his lover are stabbed to death in the middle of a tryst.  Homicide Detective Eve Dallas is called to the scene and finds the man's wife standing over the bodies with their blood on her hands.  She's got means, motive and opportunity.  A slam dunk?  Not really.  The wife in question is Reva Ewing, an ex- Secret Service agent who is a hero for \\"taking one\\" for the president and an employee of Roarke's.  Reva is spear-heading a top secret government contract to counter a destructive computer virus that could cripple the country.  Eve and Roarke believe that Reva's involvement in this project is the reason she is being so clearly set up.  The two of them team up along with the regulars Peabody, Feeney and McNabb to figure out who wanted Reva's cheating husband killed, why they wanted Reva set up and why a few other civilians are turning up dead.<br />For me the good part of this book isn't really the murder mystery.  If you've read the other 15 or so books in the series, you've already sussed out Eve's rhythms.  She remains consistent in how she works, how she thinks and where she connects the dots.  As far as plots go, this one was so-so and the villain wasn't even very interesting or scary.<br />No, what made this book good continues to be the story arc of Eve's dark past and her relationship with her husband and the people who surround her.  From the very first book \\"Naked In Death\\" when we first meet Eve we are in a nightmare with her as she relives her horrific childhood.  Over the course of the series  Roberts has handed out dribs and drabs of information so that Eve has learned bit by bit more about her past.  Obviously Eve has the resources to learn more but she chooses not to.  Yet this case, brings her past starkly  into the present.  Not only does Eve unwittingly learn much more about her past she but it also brings her into direct conflict with Roarke.  Although Eve and Roarke have clashed in the past over their own ideas of justice and vengeance,this time the difference isn't just philosophical but deeply personal.  They spend a large part of the story divided and uncommunicative with each other.  It is a nice, realistic bump in a relationship that in series time is only about two years old.  It brings it home that even though they are deeply in love and quite devoted, Eve and Roarke still have a lot to learn about each other.<br />If you haven't read the other books in the series, you could follow the plot very easily.  But there are a lot of references to people and names in the previous books that you could miss some necessary subtext.  Not the best of the series but a good, comfortable installment.<br />I recommend	2004-02-18

However, the defeat of Jingu of the Minwanabi doesn't end Mara's problems.  Jingu's son Desio and his nephew Tasaio have merely taken up the family cause.  And Tasaio was the cunning architect of the plans that killed Mara's father and brother. A long range thinker and a proponent of the idea of a well laid plan, Tasaio is a formidable enemy.<br />In the meantime, Mara buys Kevin of Zun and takes him into her home as a slave.  As prisoners of war from the land of Midkemia across the rift, Kevin and his \\"barbarian\\" countrymen make terrible slaves.  They don't believe in the Kelewanese concept of caste or of their treatment of slaves.  They are rebellious, prone to escape  and refuse to bow down to their masters.  Mara is fascinated by the handsome slave and his strange ideas of freedom.  Soon Mara and Kevin become lovers and Mara begins to learn more about the way of life in Midkemia.  Kevin quickly becomes a valuable part of Mara's household and in her fight against her enemies.  Mara has always been an unpredictable thinker and incorporating Kevin's off-worlder ideas into the fabric of her moves in the Great Game of Council further confounds her enemies.<br />Once again Mara manages to outwit her enemies using unconventional thinking, a lot of luck, and an Emperor who doesn't plan to be just a figurehead any longer.<br />The second book of Wurts' and Feist's  Empire series is equal parts political fantasy and romance novel.  Mara is once again deeply involved in the maneuverings and manipulations that at once gain her stature among her peers and strengthen her House against those who would see her destroyed.  The inclusion of Kevin gives Mara a true love interest (her abusive husband from the previous book doesn't qualify) and gives her an outsider's view of her culture's enigmatic and often destructive way of life.  It also ushers in the change of Mara from uncanny survivor to social reformer.  <br />I liked the first book in the series but I liked this one better.  The characters deepen, we see more of the countryside and meet more of the Tsurani people including the Emperor and the mysterious Black Robes.  The introduction of the outlander Kevin to the story helps to drive the plot and also serves as a logical place for exposition.  Kevin can stand in for the reader and ask the questions \\"Why\\" and make the wry observations that about the Tsurani way of life.   He serves brilliantly as the Outsider-who shakes-up-the-establishment and is the focal point of the members of Mara's household beginning to question their culture's stance on many issues including honor, death and slavery.  <br />Great book.  I Highly recommend.	2004-02-08

Just a few short gongs away from being pronounced a priestess of the Goddess Lashima, Mara of the Acoma is whisked away from the sanctuary of the Goddess to take over as Ruling Lady of her House.  Her father and brother, through the devious machinations of a lifelong enemy have perished in the Riftwar.  Now it is up to Mara, a young, naïve girl to see to it that her family name isn't obliterated.  <br />In the land of Tsurani, the ruling houses play a deadly form of political one-upmanship known as The Great Game.  Murder is only frowned upon if you do it in poor form. And Mara's death is being meticulously planned by the same wily person who planned her father's death.  But Mara, young though she is, won't go without a fight.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and Mara flouts long held traditions in order to bring her family name back to strength.  Mara quickly learns how to play the Game and to manipulate events to her favor.  She gains a provident alliance with an alien race, she chances upon a very clever spy, and she brokers herself into an advantageous marriage.  And while Mara only does what she needs to in order to survive, others see her as ambitious and dangerous, creating more enemies than she started with.<br />The Good:<BR>I love political intrigue books especially set in fantasy, alien worlds.  Tsurani has a very oriental flavor which is a real nice departure from the more common western-European/medieval flavor most fantasy novels have.  The authors do a fantastic job of painting a picture of a very mannered culture steeped in very rigid ideals of honor, caste and duty.<br />Mara is an engaging heroine.  You get her inner dialogue full of doubt, fear, desperation and you get her outer visage that is remote, serene and above all, correct.  She is the ultimate out-of-the box thinker and in the context of the story it works.  Desperation often makes people do unconventional things.  It is also nice that while the authors make her a generally sympathetic character she can also be as manipulative and ambitious as her detractors think she is.<br />Great set up for the next book in the series.<br />The Not So Good.<BR>Things happen too neatly for Mara.  She is extremely lucky and I think this is a flaw in the storytelling.  Yes, it is great to see Mara triumph and outwit her enemies, but I wish the road to her triumph was a bit sloppier, not so precise.  People don't act like you want them to all the time.  They are unpredictable and surprising.  But they fall into her traps easily enough.  Also she hits the right mark too often.  Yes, she listened to her father practice state craft as a child but sometimes her actions bespeak a sophistication that should be beyond her.<br />But these are small quibbles.  Overall this was a fun and fast read and leaves you anticipating the follow up.<br />I highly recommend.	2004-02-02

Gavril's father is cruelly murdered and his men-at-arms come to fetch Gavril to take his rightful place as ruler.  Kidnapped and made prisoner in the snowy, dreary Kastel, Gavril slowly learns the full truth of his inheritance.  Meanwhile Gavril is a target.  Eugene of Tielen wants to crown himself emperor and invading and subduing all of the lands of Rossiya (of which Azkhendir is one) is priority.  And Eugene believes that the time is ripe to destroy Akzhendir while the untested and weak Gavril is too new to his rule to be a real threat.  Treachery, evil spirits, magic, deceit, betrayal and revolution all meld together as Gavril is forced to embrace his fate.  <br />When I read the reviews of this book, I was excited because the praise seemed to point to a plot and characters that were different from standard issue fantasy fare and full of fresh ideas and surprises.  This is certainly true....sort of.   <br />The book is largely set in a time and place that is reminiscent of Tsarist Russia (right down to having a character named Astasia and hungry commoners threatening revolt).  The main character turns into a creature that is a weird amalgm of vampire and dragon and he is referred to as Drakhoul or Draghoan. There is magic and alchemy, but they are presented side by side with such \\"modern\\" technology as guns, cannon and a device that sounds kinda like an ornately ornamental walkie-talkie.  Overall the book has a very old world eastern European vibe as opposed to the decidedly medieval era western European vibe you get with a lot of the fantasy being written.  So in this instance the feel of the book is very different.<br />What isn't so outstanding or spectacular is the execution of the story.  Somewhere inside this book is a better book dying to get out.  The characters were intriguing but  flat. They had no real flesh, to me.I felt that the character development really suffered because the plot took so much precedence.  There are a lot of characters and a lot of things happened to those characters very quickly.  One character finds out about her parentage after having lived all of her life in ignorance and then a few chapters later, by chance, meets her long lost grandmother and then a few chapters later, masters a difficult inherited family trait.  I guess there is a reason why so many fantasy writers write volumes that are 600 or more pages long.<br />I obviously can't give the book unqualified praise.  But I didn't hate it either.  I am looking forward to the follow up books if for no other reason than to see if the characters develop better and to see what happens next.	2004-01-16
US	53050096	R2QKRZC5L8QBK1	0765304252	365510736	The Moon's Shadow (Saga of the Skolian Empire)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Great blend of sci fi and romance	Jaibriol Qox III has just assumed the carnelian throne of the Eubian Empire.  He is the rightful heir to the throne, his DNA says so.  But no one else is aware that his DNA also says that he is the son of the late Sauscony (Soz) Valdoria, the hated Imperator of the Eubian Empire's sworn enemy, The Skolian Empire.  Jaibriol (or Jai as he likes to be called) was born in exile where his mother and father, Jaibriol II, fled after faking their deaths.  In the aftermath of the crippling Radiance War,  he now believes his parents are really dead and that he has a duty to see that they didn't die in vain. <br />Realizing he is the only chance the warring worlds have for peace, he reveals himself to the Eubians and thus takes his place as Emperor.  But it is harder than Jai thought.  He is young and inexperienced.  The Hightons, the ruling class on Eube, speak in a florid meandering language that is full of subtext and hidden meaning.  Jai can't seem to master the subletites so he blunders constantly.  Making enemies early on, he quickly becomes the target of assassination plots <br />But Jai gains unlikely allies in the woman he makes his empress, Tarquine Iquar, and his wily adviser Corbal Xir.  All three have devastating secrets that if they  came to light mean sure death.  In Tarquine  and Corbal Jai gains access to the experience and ruthlessness necessary to run his empire.  But he manages to maintain his own internal idealism and need to meet the Skolians at the peace table.<br />If you haven't read any of the other books of the series, then this probably isn't the best place to be starting.  In the previous seven books, there is so much back-story, so much explanation of the events that lead to Jai taking the throne, that you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you tried to start here.  <br />Reading this book, it made me think of Jai as a  narc under deep cover.  Constantly watching his back trying not to make a false move.  Having to pretend to transcend is kinda like a undercover cop having to commit crime to be accepted.  He is deep in enemy territory and one false move could get a slave collar slapped on his throat.  The irony, of course , is that he is the rightful emperor and this is his empire.  He should be right at home.  He should be able to make changes if he wants, but the way of life and the attitudes of the people are so ingrained that his efforts are frightening and make him an assassination target.<br />But he has Tarquine, who after Soz, has become my favorite character in these books.  She is tough, wily, smart, duplicitous, forward thinking, selfish, compassionate, ruthless, wise and most of all she is looking out for Jai.  I thought for sure Corbal would be the power behind Jai, but it is Tarquine who bears watching.<br />This book has a lot to recommend it.  There is Jai who is growing and learning and trying to make a legacy for his parents.  There is lots of good sex.  There is lots of great action that includes plotting and counter plotting, assassination attempts, murder, lawsuits and espionage.  There are old threads tied up a little bit (Kelric and Tarquine).  And there are the off screen developments in the Ruby dynasty.  I especially love the scenes where Kelric, Roca and Dyhianna are puzzling over Jai's motives, not realizing that he is Soz's child.  <br />Which brings me to the commenting on the whole series. I can't wait to see what happens next.  The Skolian Empire series is an excellent series of books that are wonderfully plotted.  I love the fact that the reader has so much great information about the goings on that none of the characters really know.  I love the idea that the one of the two people  who know everything has conveniently died and that the other person isn't in a position to reveal anything.  I can't wait until the Valdorias all find out about Jai.  I can't wait until Jai finds out about his parents.  I can't wait until poor Roca learns about Soz and Althor. <br />So really what I am saying is:  This book is good, the series is good and I can't wait til the next book. <br />I highly recommend	2004-01-08

Milla Boone's 6 week old baby boy was snatched out of her arms on a bright sunny day while she was shopping in an open air market in Mexico.  The aftermath of the kidnapping had a profound impact on her life.  She founded an organization to help people look for missing children and she continued to look for her own son.<br />Ten years pass and Milla is no closer to finding her son, despite the fact that her son's kidnapping made news headlines.  Her single minded drive to recover her son has alienated her family, cost her her husband and sent her into very dangerous situations. <br />Then Milla meets Diaz, a mysterious figure who also specializes in finding people.  With Diaz's help, Milla manages to find out more about her missing child in a few weeks than she had in 10 years.  And the closer Milla and Diaz get to finding out the truth, the closer they are to danger.  And Milla discovers that part of the reason she never found out about her son was due to treachery and betrayal.<br />I was kinda disappointed in Linda Howard's last few offerings.  They seemed really subpar to what I know this author it capable of.  This book is more like the Howard I know.  This book is a curious amalgm of  \\"Son of the Morning\\" and \\"MacKenzie's Mountain\\" both very good books (Mackenzie's Mountain is simply excellent).<br />Milla is like Grace St. John of \\"Son of the Morning.\\"  She is a very feminine girly-girl who would have been content to be a Doctor's wife and schoolteacher and raise her own children.  But because of one moment of violence she is forced to become a tough survivor (still very girly-girl) who doesn't hesitate to kill if she must.<br />Diaz, on the other hand, is very much life Wolf Mackenzie.  A tough, loner who immediately wants to protect \\"his woman.\\"  Howard does a great job of making Diaz one of the scariest good guys you'd ever meet on paper.<br />There are some nice little plot twists and the resolution of Milla's baby search is pretty much a tearjerker.  I only gave the book four stars because there were some points that I would have liked to have seen resolved or at least revisited in an epilogue such as Milla's relationship with her family and the aftermath of Rip and Susanna's relationship.  I was also very disappointed that the plot with the smuggling ring was ended \\"off-stage\\" as it were.  I would have loved to know what the bad guys' reactions were to getting caught after all this time.  But overall a good story.  I recommend.	2003-12-06

They're famous, impossibly gorgeous and married.  They, their publicist, their fans and van loads of paparazzi have descended on the peaceful, posh village of Dorset for a few weeks of relaxation.  However, after a midnight extra-marital tryst goes awry, Tito winds up at the bottom of a cliff very dead, the victim of an apparent suicide.<br />Mitch Berger, newly minted resident of Dorset and movie critic for the New York Times is devastated. Although he viciously drubbed Tito's most recent film, he had gotten close to the troubled young superstar.  He felt that Tito was an outstanding actor who was simply wasting his talent on big budget dreck.  And there was the little matter that Mitch was the last (well second to last if you count Tito's murderer) to actually speak to Tito.<br />Enter Des Mitry, Dorset's resident Trooper and Mitch's lady love.  Des is called to the scene of Tito's death and is thus pulled into the investigation surrounding what turns out not to be suicide after all, but murder.  <br />Once again Des and Mitch team up to help solve a crime in the elite little enclave known as Dorset.<br />This book is the third in a series following \\"Cold Blue Blood\\" and \\"Hot Pink Farmhouse.\\"  This was quite a fun little book which took me no time at all to read.  I didn't really care very much about the characters of Tito or Esme since neither of them were at all sympathetic.  But that really doesn't matter because this book, and the two others before it in the series, is really about Mitch's assimilation into the Dorset community and the evolution of his relationship with Des.  Murder and Mayhem make for great plots, but the soul of this series is the three main characters: Mitch, Des and the village of Dorset. <br />The plot of the story is really a by-the-numbers murder mystery.  Long time mystery readers or even people with twisty minds will figure out the whodunit (if not the why-dunnit) very quickly.  There are the requisite red-herrings and even a secondary plot involving post 9/11 vandalism against a Muslim couple. Who was Tito meeting that night?  What is the real nature of his relationship with his wife?  Why does Esme's mother hate the snarky publicist so much?  Are the Crockets trying to manipulate Des and Mitch by revealing so much so soon?  These questions are answered in due time.<br />In the meantime, we get a picture of a closed and elite Dorset society willing to keep secrets and cover up scandals.  We see the imperfections of a so called perfect family and many not so perfect \\"perfect\\" marriages.  We are witness to the Peyton Place-esque bed-hopping of the residents and the murky tangled relationships that exist.  In the midst of it all is Sexy Des, who tries to solve a mystery in her forthright, no-nonsense, take no prisoners manner.  And Mitch, whose life-imitates-movies observations often bring the funny. Did I mention these books are quite humorous?<br />The biggest minus of this book is that I wanted to see more of the residents we'd met in the previous books.  This one did bring back Bitsy and her troubled ballerina daughter, Becca.  But I really didn't recognize any other Dorseteers from the previous books. <br />The biggest plus (other than the really cute relationship between Des & Mitch) is the continued evolution of Des' erstwhile partner, Soave.  He was a jerk in the first book, by the second book he was actually human.  And now in this third book you really actually like him.<br />I highly recommend.	2003-11-14

Ista, the dowager Royina of Chalion, had been given the means to end the curse by the very Gods themselves.  But it went horribly wrong and she spent many years with the terrible burden that she was nothing more than a murderess.  And the curse remained strong, claiming the lives of her husband and her son.  Because of the terrible burden placed on her by the Gods, Ista cursed them roundly and retreated into madness.  <br />Thanks to another who was given the means, the curse was lifted and Ista was content to live out the rest of her days quietly.  But with the quietness came boredom and the overprotection of her family and retainers.  In a desperate bid to escape her velvet prison, Ista enlisted the help of her daughter, the current Royina, and friends to go on a journey around the country side.  Under the guise of a religious pilgrimage,  Ista undertakes her journey.  What promises to be a few months of freedom instead turns into another task for the Gods.  For they are not quite finished with Ista yet.  <br />Demons have been appearing with a startling regularity and the fifth God, The Bastard, patron of the Demons, wants to welcome them back into his realm.  The Gods are all powerful but they can't lift a leaf without a human agent.  The God enlists the unwilling Ista and in doing so draws her into to the life of Arhys dy Lutez and the mystery of Castle Porifors.  Ista, the reluctant saint, must corral a posse of enslaved Demons and aid a sundered soul in getting back to its God, while also confronting the demons of her own past.<br />This book is a sequel to the also excellent `Curse of Chalion.'  It is not necessary to have read the first book to enjoy the second, but it does help explain some of Ista's sometimes oblique references.  I gave this book 4 ½ stars instead of five because the beginning is a bit slow.  But once the book hits it stride about 1/3 of the way through, it becomes a serious page turner.  I barely recognized poor sad, mad Ista from the first book.  In this one she is a serious heroine who is commanding and compassionate.  Bujold writes tremendously and just as in the Curse of Chalion, she makes religion another character in the book.  While the Daughter of Spring was the main deity in the first book, the Bastard is the main one in this book.  And what a deity he is.  He has a wicked sense of humor and, as befitting a deity known as The Bastard, he seems somewhat preoccupied with matters of the flesh.  And lest you think this book is all about Ista, it really isn't.  There are other very fascinating characters such as Arhys the warrior, his brother Illvin who sacrifices a lot to keep his brother alive; Cattilara the steele-willed chatelaine of Castle Porifors; Liss the competent and fearless courier and the brothers Ferda and Foix whom we'd met in the previous book.  I hope there are other books in this series because I loved the outcome of this story and would love to visit Chalion and her people and her Gods again.	2003-11-02

It is creating minions to overrun the land of Dhrall.  The four elder Gods of Dhrall attempt to comabt this by creating young children known as dreamers (although these people aren't really young children and this is revealed fairly early on it the book).  But the dreamers aren't enough and there aren't enough people in the land of the Dhrall to combat all the minions of the Vlagh.  So the Elder Gods go out to recruit mercenaries from other lands and thus the beginnings of an epic is born.<br />I probably shouldn't be writing a review of a book I haven't finished, but...oh,well.  I must preface this by saying that I've read and adored the Belgariad and The Elenium.  So I was happy to see that Eddings has put out the beginning of a new book. However, I was quickly overcome with disappointment.  The writing seemed overly simplistic and I the characters are boring.  The good guys so very intuitive with good ideas and great skills and they all become the bestest of best friends.  They are simply too good to be true.  I've gotten very used to reading fantasy series where the characters are flawed and emotional and aren't always \\"good\\".  I found myself disinterestedly flipping the pages.  I simply wasn't engaged in the story.  And I was just fed up with the character of Eleria who was just too, too precious for words.  She seemed to embody the worst characteristics of Flute, one of Edding's earlier characters.  If I want to read a story that includes the character of Flute I'll go back and re-read the much better written and more interesting Elenium.	2003-10-29

Fat Ollie's book that he had just written and was taking off to Kinko's to get copied is stolen out his police cruiser while he is investigating the murder of a city councilman running for mayor.  Although the victim was murdered in the Eight-Eight he actually lived in the Eight-Seven so Ollie gets Carella and Kling from the Eight-Seven to help out in the investigation.  Help out?  More like do most of the investigation and actually find the perp.  While Carella and Kling are busy tracking down leads on the murderer, Ollie is busy trying to track down who stole his book.  And a brand-spanking new rookie who just might possibly go dancing with Ollie one day, hands Ollie, Carella and Kling the clue that allows them to nail the killer.<br />I found this book quite an amusing way to spend an afternoon (yup that is all it took me to read it, Gertie).  However while it was a pleasant afternoon read, I could only give it 3-stars.<br />I've read all the 87th precinct novels and found over the years that I enjoy the detectives of the Eight-Seven, their cases and their personal lives.  I, however, don't like Ollie Weekes and am dismayed that he's playing an increasingly larger  (no pun intended) role in the series.  And it isn't because of his bigoted views, although they play a part, it is because he's not an interesting character.  He's one-dimensional and has not a single quality that makes him an interesting \\"person\\" to read about for several hours.  I read books where an unsympathetic character is made compelling because the author has infused a little glimmer of humanity into their personalities that keep them from being completely flat.  McBain has not done that for Ollie for me.  If McBain had done for Ollie what Bochco/Milch et. al. did for Andy Sipowicz, then I'd have enjoyed this book much more. So to have this flat, unsympathetic caricature as the main character, really, in this book makes the book lose quite a bit of luster for me.  <br />I liked the case of themurdered councilman and the police work that lead to the capture of the perp.  And the interwoven misunderstanding where the person who stole Olie's book thinks it is true is kinda amusing.  Yet, I can't help but think there was something a little too frothy and a bit elusive about the whole thing.  I kept wishing for a bit more meat, a bit more bite, remembering back fondly to books in the series that really got me hooked on the 87th Precint: such gems in as \\"Lady, Lady, I Dit It\\", \\"Shotgun\\", \\"Tricks\\" and \\"Lullaby.\\"<br />I did like the reintroduction of Eileen Burke, a character that I loved back in the earlier books.  And while I enjoy Bert's current relationship with Sharyn, I can't help but wonder if his old flame may cause Bert some romantic angst.  Bert's romantic woes have always been a very popular draw in this series for me.<br />And finally, I can't help but be a bit turned off by McBain's somewhat intrusive semi-editorial third-voiced comments pooh-poohing political correctness.  These have been happening with much more frequency starting about the time \\"Mischief\\" came out.  Just tell the darned story.  If you don't like the fact that a hearing impaired person is called \\"impaired,\\" then use a better word, you're a writer!	2003-02-09

This is a tale of two armies.  <br />In the aftermath of Coltaine's death, the Adjunct Tavore must lead her rag-tag collection of soldiers into Raraku, the holy desert, in hopes of defeating Sha'ik's dreaded Army of the Apocalypse.   Her army is uneasy.  They are a patched together group of raw recruits, hoary old veterans and the broken survivors of Coltaine's army and they know nothing of the Adjunct, seeing her as untried and aloof. <br />In the meantime, Sha'ik is beset within her own army.  The wily Korbolo Dom and his triumphant Dogslayers are the backbone of her fighting forces, yet they have their own agenda.  The High Mages Bidithal and Febryl can't be trusted but they are necessary for Sha'ik's plans.  Betrayal seems imminent from all sides.  And Sha'ik herself is in turmoil as the Goddess of the Whirlwind and Felisin battle for the soul of the person they both inhabit.<br />The two armies meet one fateful night and two sisters will clash.  Only one will remain standing.<br />While the two armies prepare for their monumental clash,  we travel the journey of discovery with a remarkable warrior named Karsa Orlong.  We watch as Lostara Yil, one of the formidable Red Blades, and a Claw named Pearl set out on a task set for them by Adjunct Tavore only to be horrified and saddened by what they discover.  <br />This is the fourth book of the Tale of the Malazan but it picks up the thread of the story that ends in the second book, The Deadhouse Gates.  <br />I had a hard time getting into this book at first because the first 200 pages details the exploits of a seemingly unknown warrior named Karsa Orlong.  The events told actually pre-date the events of the first book of the series.  As Karsa's story begins to unfold we start to catch up with the current time in the series.  And as this first section ends, we realize that we have already met Karsa Orlong in the previous books, only by another name.  <br />As is his M.O. with this series, Erikson starts slow but kicks into stride as the book moves along and  we get to \\"current\\" events and the imminent clash of the two armies.  Felisin, who had become hard and vengeful in book 2 as a result of her feelings of betrayal by her sister and the horrors she experienced as a slave, seems to be trying to find something of the old Felisin as she struggles with the Goddess.  Erikson does a wonderful job conveying the suffocating atmosphere of distrust and imminent betrayal in Sha'ik's army while at the same time allows the slow coming together and gelling of Tavore's army.  And there are great moments of soldier humor studded throughout the book.<br />Winding throughout is a bit more deep background of the beginnings of the Malazan Empire with Kellanved.  Rope is portrayed as surprisingly human despite the fact that he's a God.  And we get to watch (and mourn again) as people learn about the demise of the Bridgeburners.<br />Even though this is a good book to read, it was somewhat disappointing following the magnificent drama that was the third book, Memories of Ice.  But the ending is spectacular (another of Erikson's M.O.s with this series) and once again is heartbreaking and leaves one with the astonished realization that he has managed to turn your assumptions or expectations of a character completely around and in a very realistic way.<br />Not the very best of the series, but still very good and better than many other books being written in the genre.	2003-01-25
US	53050096	R16YD0BGAVTMNT	042518630X	371295585	Purity in Death	Books	4	1	1	N	N	This series is still rocking along quite well, thank you.	A mild mannered low-level drug dealer goes berserk and kills his neighbor.  Everyone who knew him thought of him as a quiet man who, although he peddled drugs to kids, wasn't the type to harm anyone.  A member of a wealthy and powerful family slits his own throat.  He had everything to live for: he was handsome, rich and a pedophile that routinely got away with his crimes because the system couldn't touch him.  A porn king goes on a rampage and butchers his live in Lolita and then himself.  His last entries in his diary show a man well satisfied with his life.  The only thing Eve Dallas finds that these men have in common in a cryptic message on their computer screens.  With the help of her friends and colleagues in the NYPSD Eve Dallas must hunt down a killer that uses a computer virus that infects the users, not just the computer.<br />This is the fourteenth installment of Nora Roberts'  \\"....In Death \\" series and it is still entertaining, if for no other reason to catch up on the characters to see where they've progressed from since the lat book.  I liked this book particularly because it seems to be more purely police procedural.  There are still the futuristic elements and the romance elements that are a mainstay of all the books, but this one somehow seems to be a little less formulaic than the others.<br />For one, we don't ever get an idea who might the murderer(s) be until well into the second half of the book.  Where many of the previous books, especially the last two, seemed to be as much about the personality of the criminals perpetrating the crime as they are about Eve, this one seems more about the crime itself and the police work involved.  <br />Also, Roberts added a nice little layer about the gray areas of police work.  Previously, Eve's victims had all been pretty much blameless, if not spotless people.  In this book the victims, by and large, are people who prey on young kids.  Who cares if these people get offed?  Society would be so much betterwithout them.  But those of us who know Eve know that she simply doesn't think that way.  She stands for the dead, regardless of who they were.  For those of us who are \\"Homicide: Life on the Street\\" fans, the discussions about this very subject bring back fond memories of Frank and Tim's discussions of this very subject.  And the character of Eve Dallas is very close in ideal to the character of Frank Pembleton.<br />And finally, I think I love the idea of Eve's team working from Eve's palatial home as much as they do.  Circumstances force them to work on this latest crime around the clock at her house and we see our favorite regulars, Peabody, McNabb and Feeney as well as some other familiar faces, consuming her great food and using Roarke's state of the art computer facilities.<br />Once again, Nora Roberts scores.  This is a welcome installment in a series that should be getting tired but just seems to be getting better.	2002-09-02
US	53050096	R2BX1YQEGN6KH0	0743204700	471518023	An Accidental Woman	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Good story	In the middle of the night, the FBI appear at Heather Malone's home with an arrest warrant claiming she is actually a woman named Lisa Matlock.  Lisa Matlock is wanted for a 15 year old murder.<br />The town of Lake Henry is shocked.  Nice, gentle Heather could not possibly be this woman that they are talking about.  But as people begin to question the assertions of the FBI, they also begin to question themselves.  Nobody really knows much about Heather's life before she appeared in Lake Henry 14 years ago.  Not Micah, the man that she's been living with for the past several years and with whom she's made a life and built a business.  Not Poppy, the woman who counts herself as Heather's best friend.<br />...<br /> This book is actually two stories in one.  The main story is really Poppy & Griffin's love story.  The seconday story is Heather's plight.  As much as I liked this book (and I really did enjoy reading it) I only gave it three stars for several reasons:<br />1) Poppy and Griffin's story is a welcome continuation of what was begun in Delinsky's earlier story set in Lake Henry, \\"Lake News.\\"  As such it is gratifying to catch up with Poppy again and see that she gets her guy.  But, as nice as it is to see these two get together, their story wasn't as compelling as Heather's story.  And because it wasn't as compelling, I became a little impatient at their passages because I couldn't wait to get back and see what new revelations there were about Heather.<br />2) For all that Heather was a major catalyst to the story, that is all that she remained.  She had no voice in this book.  She was, for all intents and purposes, mute.  She refused to talk about her past, and even when she did finally give Poppy a crumb, it was just three words and she mouthed it silently.  I am sure that that was a conscious decision on Delinksy's part to keep Heather silent, so that we learned about her from other people.  This worked really well for Delinsky in \\"Coast Road\\" where her heroine is in a coma and her family reflects on her life so that the only way the reader sees this pivotal character is through other characters eyes.  Although I liked that technique in \\"Coast Road\\" I didn't like it so much here.  I wanted the hear Heather.<br />3) Call me a sucker for the Hollywood ending, but I wanted more closure.  Heather's story was such a good one with a boffo surprise and a great ending.  But that was it.  It ended.  I wanted follow-up, I wanted closure.  I still have questions about what happened after she reunited with Micah and the girls.<br />I love Barbara Delinsky.  She is really one of the best writers of contemporary, character driven fiction out there.  And she's at her best when she's looking at the effect one person has on a whole community, as she did in \\"The Passions of Chelsea Kane.\\"  This was book was a goody stroy.  I think it would have been a great book if the Heather story had been the main focus and the Poppy story had been the secondary.	2002-08-18
US	53050096	R2JZQ19JHXMGLP	0593046242	347309733	Memories of Ice	Books	5	58	65	N	N	Fabulous	The third book of Steve Erikson's Malazan series picks up where the first book left off.  The Empress Laseen has outlawed Whiskyjack, the Bridgeburners, and Dujek Onearm after their failure to capture the jeweled city of Darujistan.  The seasoned soldiers are not long out of work.  On the continent of Genabackis there is word of a terrifying new threat.  A deranged prophet known as the Pannion Seer is on the march with a massive army of powerful mages, undead lethal warriors and thousands of cannibalistic zealots.  He has set his sights on the city of Capustan to conquer the city and for its citizens to serve as food for his ravening hordes.<br />Realizing that the city's lone defenders, The Grey Swords, are woefully outmatched, Whiskeyjack and Dujek offer assistance.  Because there are other more powerful forces propelling the Pannion, former enemies of the Malazans also offer alliance.  The Warlord Caladan Brood and the mysterious Tiste Andii Anomander Rake march with WhiskeyJack and Dujek to Capustan amidst an uneasy truce.<br />In the midst of this, the child, Silverfox is aging at a rapid rate as she attempts to fulfill her destiny.  Ganoes Paran learns the price of having walked within the sword Dragnipur, a tribe is reunited with their Gods, an ancient wrong is righted, ordinary people become heroic, heroes are shown that they are all too human and a mortal man attempts to save a God.<br />Right from the start in the first book where we are plopped in the middle of a devastating war and see a young girl possessed with the spirit of a  deadly assassin, we are immediately wrapped up in the lives and fortunes of a great many interesting people.  There is Whiskeyjack the beloved leader, who is weary of war and politics.  There is Tattersail the clever mage whose reincarnation comes at a devastating price.  There is Ganoes Paran , once a pawn to be played, becomes a master of the game.  There is the fat, affable Kruppe who confounds everyone he meets.  There is the mysterious (and wonderfully monikered) Anomander Rake, who has untold powers and hinted at sorrow. There is Empress Laseen, who may not be as evil as we think. And there is Quick Ben, who has many surprises up his sleeve.<br />Although the subject matter of bloody, horrible war (along with rape, torture, cannibalism and possible world destruction) can be quite heavy, there are still glimpses of humor and wonder in his writing.  I like the world he has built. I like the deep history that we learn as the stories progress.   I like the idea of the Deck of Dragons where the hierarchy of Gods manifests itself in a deck of cards.  And I especially like the fact that while I am pretty sure whom to root for, I am not always sure whom I should root against.  Even the seemingly unsympathetic characters seem to have good reasons to do what they do.<br />While I did read the books in order, I found that I actually had to go back and reread the first book in order to bring myself up to speed for this third one.  The second book takes a bit of a detour and, rather than picking up right where the first book left off, it instead follows the story of Ganoes Paran's sister, Felisin and her travels in the deserts of the Seven Cities.  While this was a bit of interruption in the action, it does whet the appetite for the eventual reunion of the two siblings both of whom have undergone both physical and metaphysical changes.	2002-08-14

She can do more with a sentence to create a picture than a lot of writers can do with a whole book.  Her descriptions of Tuscany made me immediately want to book a trip there.  Her descriptions of Ren's wonderful food concoctions made my mouth water.  And of course, the story of Isabel and Ren is lovely. <br />With Isabel we get the familiar SEP character arc of a woman who reaches rock bottom only to come back out on top both personally and through her romance with the hero.  And in Ren we get one of her wonderfully drawn alpha heroes.  I love the fact that he is an actor who always plays the villain in movies.<br />And of course, Nobody writes secondary characters as well as SEP does.  Ren ex-wife's romantic foibles make a great foil for the romance of Ren and Isabel and is just as engrossing.  You didn't feel as if the secondary plot was taking you away from the primary one because it was just as interesting.  But I've always found this true of her stories.<br />So why is this only a 3 star?  Well, it lacked a certain emotional depth that I know this writer is capable of.  I can't help but think of The fabulous 5-star &quot;Nobody's Baby But Mine.&quot; It is a laugh out loud funny romantic comedy and is quite frothy, but it also has some really wonderful layers that Breathing Room seems to lack.  <br />Breathing Room is a very good read, but I don't think it is SEP's best.	2002-07-23

I had never read a Brenda Joyce book before picking up her &quot;Deadly...&quot; series written as BD Joyce.  I Am finding them wonderful, engrossing and fun reads.  I can't wait until the next one.  So in the meantime, I decided to try out some of her other books.  Unfortunately, this is the fist one I picked up.<br />I am glad that this book isn't the first book that I read by this author because I am sure I would not have picked up the &quot;Deadly...&quot; series and would have missed out on a good thing.<br />I didn't like this book in the least. First of all, it made no sense.  Isabel, the ghost, had such power that she was able to manipulate events for over 400 years so that she managed to keep these two families entwined so that she could use them against each other to wreak her vengeance.  But if she had that much power what was taking her so long to destroy these people?  And then there was Cass, Antonio, Gregory and Catherine Why the heck were they so stupid?  These people all knew a ghost was manipulating them, and yet they continued to hang out in the house.  And whenever anybody went missing they always split up to go searching and they'd leave the kids behind.  I'm sorry but if I am stuck in the middle of nowhere and I know that a malevolent ghost is running around, I am not gonna go exploring a house alone and I am not gonna leave my 8 year old niece and 10 year old son  by themselves either.  At least poor Tracey had no idea what was going on, so that part at least made sense. I think the book would have been much more suspenseful if everyone else had been  like Tracey, truly at a loss as to what was happening and why.<br />And then there was the writing.  It was repetitive and I felt as if the story were going in circles.  Rather than creating a claustrophobic atmosphere of menace, all it did for me was create an air of tedium. <br />And finally, the ending stunk.  After all that ghostly menace, everything ended with a wimper.   I also feel that Isabel was, wrongly, made out to be some innocent little victim.  She wasn't.  She was as culpable in her own downfall as the people who &quot;betrayed&quot; her. <br />I am disappointed that this book was so enjoyable because I think there was a really good book somewhere in there begging to get out.	2002-06-24
US	53050096	R1KL7HQHKVK693	039914840X	818968546	Three Fates	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good things come in threes	Malachi, Gideon and Rebecca Sullivan are siblings with a mission.  They are the owners of a small silver figurine, one of a trio of figurines that, apart are merely valuable, together are priceless.  The Sullivans had a dream of reuniting the pieces.  However a miscalculation on their part, resulted in the theft of their own figurine by an unscrupulous and greedy antiques dealer. It becomes a race against time and a battle of wits between the Sullivans and the very dangerous Anita Gaye to locate the other two pieces.  Along the way the siblings encounter adventure, murder and love.<br />This story unfolds itself in three acts.  The first act is merely the setting of the stage, the meeting of the players.  Malachi, the oldest of the Sullivans attempts to tracks down one of the Fates through Tia Marsh, a neurotic hypochondriac who is tougher than she looks.  Gideon the middle Sullivan son tracks down Cleopatra Tolliver, a tough, free-spirited stripper who just might know something about one of the figurines.  And Rebecca Sullivan, the youngest daughter with a talent for hacking gets surprised by Jack Burdett, a security expert who knows a lot more than about what is going on than anyone else. We also get to meet the nefarious and beautiful Anita Gaye.<br />The second act brings all the players together.  The six people with an abiding interest in the Fates form an uneasy alliance.  Not altogether trusting, they squabble and keep secrets until a shocking act of malice forces them to realize that Anita Gaye is more dangerous than they thought and they need to band together to defeat her.<br />Things really get enjoyable in the third act.  It reads like an old fashioned caper where MISSION IMPOSSIBLE meets OCEANS 11.  The band of six each use their own unique talents to trap a spider in her own web.<br />This was a fun book.  Being a Nora Roberts, it of course is well written and full of sexy romance.  In that sense the book will hit some very familiar notes for Robertsfans, especially the first two-thirds of the book.  If the whole book had run on the same vein, then this would have been a 3-star book.  But in the last third she kicks it up a notch and it gets really fun.  I liked the art of the con and the understated humor.  <br />My only quibble with this book (and this is why it is a 4-star and not a 5-star) is the character of Anita Gaye.  She was a boring villain.  Too villainous, too black not enough grey.  For those Roberts fans who've read PRIVATE SCANDALS you will recognize the doppelganger of Angela Perkins.	2002-04-07

Picking up right where A Kiss Of Shadows left off, this book continues the story of Meredith and her quest to stay alive by gaining the throne of the Unseelie court.  Back in L.A. Meredith continues her job as an investigator while trying to get pregnant by one of her sexy sidhe guards.  In one of her cases, Meredith meets up with an exiled member of the Seelie court and becomes privy to a powerful secret.  But it also paints a new target on her back.  Now she has to navigate the treacherous political waters of the Seelie court as well as the Unseelie.  We get to meet the King of the Seelie court (great scene) and also Merry's mother.<br />I am enjoying this series immensely.  It is unabashedly erotic and extremely imaginative.  I enjoyed the first book, but felt it was a 'setting the stage' book somewhat.  Now that I know many of the players, I was ready to sit back to watch them on their continuing adventures.  We learn a little bit more about Doyle, Frost, Rhys and even Kitto.  We also learn more about the deep past of the Faerie.  The politics of the Seelie court make for an interesting contrast to those of the Unseelie and it is fascinating to 'watch' the infighting amongst the faerie world.<br />The ending was slam-bang and promises a fascinating future for our Merry band. I can't wait to see where they go from here. My only quibble with the book is that it was too short!  I wanted it to last longer.	2002-04-04

The family is devastated and Eve Dallas gets the call.  Eve quickly realizes who did the deed.  The perpetrator is someone who has a personal vendetta against Eve herself and taunts Eve with every body that falls at her feet.  Now Eve must find the murderer before they can target Roarke.  Also, Eve finally confronts her tragic past. Oh, yeah the final confrontation between Eve and the murderer is worth a couple of re-reads.<br />There are a lot of familiar things about this book.  First there is Eve.  She is still the tough as nails cop with a deep heart and a bruised soul that we were first introduced to in \\"Naked in Death.\\"  I like the progression I've seen in the books.  That first book had a very isolated Eve haunted by suppressed memories of  her horrific childhood.  This 14th book has an Eve is completely surrounded by friends and people who love her and she (and we)  finally get the whole story behind her childhood.  Usually Peabody gets the best lines, but in this one Eve gets few.  There are some real smile-out-loud moments when Eve is confronted with the wide-open spaces of Texas and cows and horses.<br />And then there is everyone else.  The usual suspects makes their appearance.  Peabody is still at Eve's side and gets to take on a case of her own; McNab is still flashy; Charles the LC and his new girlfriend Dr. Louise are minor supporting characters and of course Roarke is still the sexiest fictional character around.<br />I really enjoy this series and look forward to the next one in six months.  These books are truly Nora Roberts at her best!	2002-03-13

We get to meet them, warts and all, chapter by chapter.  The first chapter introduces us to Viola, the matriarch of the family.  Viola, in the hospital suffering from a massive asthma attack, is wearied and worried by her spouse and her offspring.  In her first-person narrative voice that instantly evokes reminiscences of listening to my own grandmother's southern-black-English argot, we get to hear from Viola's perspective the strengths and weaknesses of her family.  Because she sounds so real her impressions leap right off the page and into your own consciousness until you find yourself agreeing with Viola.  Yes!  Her husband is an ungrateful wretch who moved out with no warning.  Yes!  Her constantly-in-jail son is book smart but street stupid for allowing himself to fall into the trap that has snared so many other black men.  Yes!  Her oldest daughter is a control freak who spends too much time looking out for others and not enough time looking out for herself.  Yes!  Her second daughter is too blinded by jealousy to really see how much her family loves her and Yes!  Her youngest daughter has been too dependent on others and can't stand up on her own two feet.<br />But wait a minute.  Before you get too comfortable with these characterizations, Ms. McMillan switches gears and allows the others to speak for themselves.  In Cecil's chapters we see a man who has a wife who is astonishingly self sufficient, grown children who don't really need him anymore and a life that has seemingly passed him by.  We see someone who still has an enormous amount of respect for his spouse but who feels useless in her world. In Lewis' chapters we meet a man who is incredibly intelligent but who has never had anyone pushing him to succeed.  Instead his family pigeonholes him into the slot of a drunken failure, never seeing the man underneath the surface who has dreams and aspirations like everyone else. In Charlotte's chapters we hear from a woman who has always felt like the outsider in her family.  Doing desperate, sometimes unkind things simply to get them to notice her.  She longs for the approval of her family and constantly seeks ways to get it only to be defeated by bitterness when she feels she's come up short in some way.  In Janelle's chapters we visit a woman who having been the petted baby of the family is trying to re create what she feels is the perfect family and is desperately trying to create an identity.  She marries unwisely and realizes too late the price she has to pay for her naivete.  And finally, Paris' chapters reveal the oft told story of the oldest sibling given too much responsibility too early.  Having been put on a pedestal, Paris strives mightily to live up to the image of perfection she believes her family has of her.  But at what cost?<br />I usually get all bent out of shape when a story is told with shifting P.O.V.s  but in this case, the voice of each of these characters is central to this story.  Ms.  McMillan has no trouble moving from the clipped, &quot;proper&quot; tones of the uber-educated Janelle and Paris to the more blue-collar street slangy tones of Lewis and Charlotte.  Each sibling and each parent is fully in charge of the space he or she inhabits.  The care taken in crafting each character in this book is so subtle that it is easy to miss how sophisticated the storytelling in this book really is. There is a reason that Terry McMillan was the vanguard for the renaissance and current popularity of African-American popular fiction and this book is represents that reason.  Ms. Macmillan is an engaging writer who writes absorbing stories. I recommend.	2001-09-15

Lynn Harris's preceding books where Basil makes an appearance, that I would actually like this character. I've always kinda despised Basil. But in this book, I couldn't help but like him. Sure he's in deep denial about his sexuality, and he is wrong for not telling his fiance that about his bisexual past. And I think he is basically a very weak person. But, bless his heart, he is trying in this book. He believes he is in love with Yancey so he works at it and he really does try to make it all work. So I give him a lot of credit. Unfortunately, Basil really is the only major character who is in this book (Although a very minor character, Windsor, is also very admirable). I disliked Yancey a lot. I applaud Mr. Harris for creating such a seriously flawed character who, unfortunately, rings true. Yancey is supremely selfish and self-absorbed. She is jealous, manipulative, materialistic and completely dishonest. Yes, the book addresses why Yancey is such a messed up person, but in my opinion, the little glimpses of humanity we see in Yancey are a little too little to late. And don't get me started on her mother...grrr!<BR>Altho there are some real unsympathetic characters in this book, it is a page turner! It is a very entertaining and fun read	2001-08-30

It seemed different and interesting. So I was very excited to read it. I am very disappointed to say that this book wasn't as original or interesting as I thought it would be. As I was reading it, I kept thinking to myself, hmmm \\" Ms. Joy has written a regency romance, reversed the gender roles so that women are the powerful ones and men are subservient, and then added some funky made-up words so that it seems sciency-fictiony.\\" I found myself skipping whole passages because I expected to drawn into a whole new place and was instead revisiting a familiar place that was simply wearing a mask. I can't recommend this book.

Although I loved the wonderful Skye OMalley by Ms. Small, I had begun to shy away from any more of Ms. Smalls books because, frankly, I was sick of Skyes many children and grandchildren. Im gratified to see that Ms. Small has gotten away from the OMalley saga and has turned her attention to creating other characters far and away from Skye. Having said that, however, The Duchess isnt one of her best efforts. Allegra is beautiful, rich and accomplished. But shes almost too perfect. Shes intelligent, educated, accomplished, makes friends easily, strikes the right tone is almost every social situation, has friends in high places, and impresses all the right and important people. Shes a 17 year old girl who becomes a high profile peer overnight and makes absolutely no social gaffes. I just wanted the girl to break out with a pimple on her nose or something. Relentless perfection isnt very interesting reading. I like characters with flaws who have texture and who grow.<br />Allegra and her Duke marry, making pains to tell everyone repeatedly that they arent in love. It would be charming except Allegra constantly talks about how she doesnt recognize love. Rather than seeming to shed a light on her fears or even to give depth to her personality, this repetition merely sounds labored and pedantic. I did appreciate Ms. Smalls efforts at fleshing out some of the historical figures of 18th century England (even if she does go about it in a Jerry-Springer-trashy-gossip sort of way). I could have done without all the descriptions of food, though. And while Ive only given this book two stars, it actually deserves an extra half-star for not allowing Allegra to be kidnapped into a harem to learn unearthly sexual delights.	2001-08-26

A lovely  widow turns out to be pregnant.  Only problem is, her husband has been dead at least a year.  She lives in a cul de sac with three other couples.  The three couples are all experiencing some manner of strain in their marriages.  Once the pregnancy of the widow becomes apparent, each of the wives silently wonder if her husband is the father.<br />The main couple of the story, Amanda and Graham, is  the most intriguing.  They are struggling with infertility.  Married for five years they both desperately want a child but are turned off and wearied by years of fertility procedures. The interesting issue that Delinsky explores with this couple how the idea of conception can begin to overpower everything else in a marriage.  Even a very strong and healthy love.  <br />The second couple, Karen and Lee Cotter are much more volatile.  Lee has had infidelity issues in the past.  They aren't as much a focus as Amanda and Graham but they do provide a stark contrast to Amanda and Graham.  Karen and Lee have 4 children and many  more problems.<br />The third couple Georgia and Russ seem almost an afterthought. Georgia is the driven executive who travels four days out of five.  Russ is the stay at home husband who watches the kids and writes freelance articles.  It is a reversal of traditional gender roles.  Comparatively speaking, Georgia and Russ have few problems except her absence.   <br />Delinsky gives each man a plausible motive for possibly having slept with the widow.  And she even manages to throw suspicion on each one of them in various parts of the book.  Although the identity of the father adds a nice little bit of suspense, the more engrossing part of the book is the makeup of each of the three marriages and the reasons why these women can find it so easy to suspect their husbands of infidelity.<br />I always enjoy Barbara Delinsky's work.  This book is no exception.	2001-08-23
US	53050096	R3VAEFFW2VDH2Q	0399147845	384174271	What You Owe Me	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Pretty good but lacks focus	Before I read this book, I thought it would be a very straightforward tale of betrayal, revenge and reparation.  In some sense, it is just that.  But there are so many other things going on in this book that I think the main story gets lost somewhere.<br />The first 11 chapters of this book is a fairly tight and riveting story of Hosanna and Gilda's relationship.  We hear the story of Hosanna and Gilda in Hosanna's first-person narration.  It is post WWII L.A.  Black people have not prospered the way they should have.  Hosanna is a maid who is strong willed and ambitious.  She doesn't want to wash people's floors for the rest of her life.  Although an optimist, Hosanna is very emotionally hardened by the relentlessness of daily racism.  At one point later on, Matriece, Hosanna's daughter says &quot;She was born the wrong race and the wrong gender at the wrong time.&quot;  There is a clear message even in these early pages that Hosanna could have been a success if it weren't for the tragedy of racism.<br />Along comes Gilda who is a Jewish woman.  She is, as seen through the eyes of Hosanna, a timid woman who is simply surviving day to day from the ravages of her past.  She is a Holocaust survivor of the Nazi death camps.  Because this first part of the book is told from Hosanna's viewpoint, we never get a real bead on Gilda.  For me, she remained a very remote figure, even later on when the POV switches to the third-person omniscience of the author.  She is molded not just by her experiences as a prisoner but also as a person who finds herself in Hosanna's forceful presence.  Even though it is true that she takes off with the money she and Hosanna make from their small cosmetics venture, it is very difficult to actually hate Gilda.  <br />At about chapter 12 the focus shifts, in more ways than one.  We are now in present day LA and Hosanna's daughter Matriece is living the bitterness of her mother.  She is working for Gilda, who is now a cosmetics giant (think EsteeLauder)  and biding her time to get the reparations she is owed.  But this isn't the only story.  The narrative splinters all over the place.  We get a story of an unhappy singer and her relationship with her absentee dad.  We get a story of a woman who is slowly losing touch with her son.  We get a story of a man with a gambling problem who is desperate for money.  We get the story of the directionless son of a powerful black businessman.  There are a lot of little stories all interconnected that get a lot of attention but the main story of Hosanna's legacy gets buried somewhere amongst them all. <br />Of course there are some interesting themes that run through all the stories.  The treacherous waters of parent/child relations run through all the stories.  Matriece and Hosanna's relationship is just a back-drop for all the other parental relationships in the story.  And the title alone &quot;What you owe me&quot; is strongly thematic of the entire book.  Reparations is a heavy undercurrent in here.  Gilda's receipt of a check from a Swiss bank with the money from her parents' savings (including 50 years of interest) is just a tangible (and ironic) example.  Everyone in the book is seeking some type of reparation for something owed.  But while the message of reparation is unmistakably clear, the answers to the question it raises is not so clear.  Is it worth the time, effort and emotional toll to seek what is owed or is it better make a fulfilling life with what you have?<br />I wish the book had been more focused on Matriece's struggle and Hosanna's legacy.  As it is, it becomes almost anticlimactic.  I did like the book because, although I found these other people's stories somewhat distracting, I couldn't help but like them, become very involved in them and root for them.  This is a testament to Ms. Campbell's the absorbing storytelling.  While I can't give this book 5 stars, I do think it is a good absorbing read and I do recommend it.	2001-08-22

She is the owner of the lovely and prosperous Pinewood manor and a well respected member of local society.  But her world comes crashing down around her when Ferdinand Dudley appears on her doorstep flashing the deed to her house.  He states that  she is not the owner because he won it in a card game from son of the previous owner.  But Viola is adamant.  The old Earl who owned the house promised to change his will in her favor and she has faith in his word.  So the two are at a stalemate.  Both are claiming ownership and neither will leave.   But fate arrives in the person of Ferdinand's brother, the Duke of Tresham.  Viola's past catches up with her and, despite the fact that she and Ferdinand were beginning to fall in love, she flees to London to save Ferdinand  from himself and to confront the one person determined to ruin her life.<br />This book takes place largely in two parts.  The first half of the book is the bucolic country setting where Viola and Ferdinand meet and get to know each other.  They have the inevitable conflict so that their relationship isn't easy or smooth.  In this first half of the book, the conflict is over the ownership of the house and Viola's resentment of Ferdinand for upsetting her life.  However as the two get to know each other and fall in love, that conflict could easily be overset by simply marrying.<br />But then comes the second part of the book, which is set in London.  Marriage is out of the question.  Because this is a Mary Balogh book we know that Viola isn't what she appears,  Viola has A Past and it has caught up with her.  The conflict of the second part of the book is how to reconcile Viola's past so that the path toward a happy  ending with Ferdinand is cleared.  While, you can see the plot from a mile away, it doesn't stop the book from successfully accomplishing its goals.  And the revelations and conversations in the wake of the revelations are nicely done.<br />I don't give this book five stars because the first half of the book was a bit tedious.  I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, as I knew it must.  The second half of the book more than makes up for the slowness of the first half.  And some of the secondary characters get fleshed out a bit more.  I couldn't help but be reminded of one of Ms. Balogh's other books, &quot;Indiscreet &quot; as I was reading this one, as it is the same in structure and plot.  But &quot;Indiscreet&quot; was a much better book both in character development and in the sheer storytelling (worth 5 stars in my opinion).  While this one isn't as good as &quot;Indiscreet&quot;, it is still entertaining, nonetheless.	2001-08-18
US	53050096	R2DHN5ME1687XT	0380979012	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Excellent book!	Cazaril never thought he'd find himself the tool of the Gods.  However finding himself the trusted secretary of  Iselle, a royal heiress, after having been a galley slave must be due to more than sheer luck.  But being a tool of a God doesn't come cheap.  He must somehow break a 3 generation curse on the royal.  Only problem is, Cazaril isn't quite sure how to do this.  In the meantime, Cazariel is the target of a very powerful personal enemy. The prophecies say that lifting he curse may cost him his life.  And while Cazariel is willing to die for his Royesse, his death just may not be enough to save her...<br />I must admit I am guilty of typecasting Ms. Bujold.  I am a hardcore and dedicated fan of her Vorkosigan series so I was a bit skeptical about this new, non-Miles book.  I had a weird sense of displacement as I began to read it.  It took a chapter of two stop it, but I couldn't help trying to find Miles somewhere in there.  <br />Miles isn't there but the elegant writing and exquisite prose that are a hallmark of Ms. Bujold most certainly are.  While the plot of this book is not groundbreaking or  even particularly original, the book is made enjoyable by the strength of its' characters and ideas.  Cazariel is a very interesting protagonist.  He is truly fragile in the beginning of the book.  It is clear that he is suffering from the trauma of his imprisonment as a slave.  The fact that a person who had enjoyed a high station in life before his enslavement would gladly welcome the prospect of being a lowly, albeit free, kitchen scullion speaks more about the horrors the character suffered than any full-bodied descriptions could.  It is with true enjoyment that I read on and saw the somewhat timid Cazariel with the seriously flayed sense of self esteem change throughout the course of the book and become the confident and even feared courtier that he was before his enslavement.<br />In addition to Cazariel, theology is probably the other main &quot;character&quot; in the book.   I found Ms. Bujold's concept of her world's religion fascinating.  The Gods are powerful, yet not omnipotent.  In order to achieve their ends they are constrained to work through humans, yet humans are not merely mindless pawns moved across a chess board.  For both the God and the person, the idea of the human's free will is key to divine intervention. <br />All, in all this was a truly good read.  It is full of  great dialogue, humor, romance, and of course  characters. And although there is no Miles, I couldn't help but find glimpses of Ivan in Palli and Cordelia in Iselle.  I highly recommend.	2001-08-14

However, the fight for Pale was unutterably ugly even for the seasoned fighters in the Malazan army.  But Empress Laseen isn't quite finished yet.  She is determined to grind Darujhistan, the last of the Free Cities, under her heel.  However, many forces both inside and outside the Malazan empire are conspiring to see that doesn't happen.  Tattersail, a powerful mage in the employ of the Empress has just witnessed the death of many of her companions during the siege of Pale. As they make the move toward Darujhistan, Tattersail wonders if the death of so many powerful mages was indeed the work of the enemy or rather of someone closer to home.  Whiskeyjack, the seasoned veteran of the elite Bridgeburners squad also has doubts about why so many of his people were left to die in the siege.  Ganoes Paran, a newly promoted captain knows he is simply a pawn, but whose?  And finally the gods themselves have decided to take a hand in things.  How will their presence affect matters?<br />I can't even begin to do justice to the plot of this story in one simple paragraph.  But I really hate to give too much a way because it is too fun to discover all the different people in this book.  I discovered Erickson while casting around for someone to read after reading the latest installment of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series.  This was recommended to me.  Little did I know that I couldn't get it in the US.  Thank heavens for amazon.co.uk!  Got it in a week... <br />I can not sing the praises of this book more.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did have a hard time getting into in the beginning.  It does begin a bit slow and there is so much information that I had a hard time absorbing it all.  But about the middle it starts to roll along and then it really picks up steam until it ends with a bang!  Great momentum and a true page turner.  And for those of you who like a big meaty book, this is it.  <br />However, the slow beginning is really worth it.  The one thing I love about this book is the main thing I love about the GRRM books, the panoply of characters.  Some are good, some are bad but many, many, more are somewhere in between.  And although there is a huge cast, Erikson somehow manages to create a wonderful depth to them all.  They each have a definite personality including quirks, foibles and vulnerabilities.  Even the unsympathetic characters are given real moments of humanity. <br />I can not recommend this enough,  If you like large, sprawling books with a lot of characters who are all plotting and counterplotting, this is it for you.  I especially recommend it for those who enjoy the Robert Jordan or GRRM series because it is along that vein that this book is written.  However, I do stress that this book is not a cookie cutter of those two.  It is as different form The Wheel of Time and The Song of Ice and Fire as they are from each other. It has its own flavor and Erikson has created a very different idea of magic in his book.  I am eagerly awaiting the second book in the series to arrive (it should be on my doorstep any day now).	2001-08-10

I did enjoy Open Season, it was cute and as is always the case with Linda Howard, very [....]  Daisy and Jack as the two main characters were good characters.  But the \\"grey\\" characters such as Sykes, Todd and  even Jennifer, the mayor's wife, were more interesting.  The problem with this book (and that is why it is only 3 stars rather than 5) is the fact that nothing and no one is delved into deeply.  This book would have been great as say, a Silhouette Special Edition, because  you don't really expect deep characters in those books (although I will point out that Linda Howard's exceptional Mackenzie's Mountain which was a Silhouette has some of the most wonderfully defined characters in any book ever written). <br />I would have liked a deeper exploration of Daisy and Jack's relationship.  I would have liked to have seen more of the home life of the Mayor and Jennifer to see why their marriage deteriorated so.  I would have liked to know more about Sykes' background.  And of course, I would have liked to have gotten in Todd's head a bit more.  Linda Howard has created the beginnings of some great characters in these people, yet we never really get to see them.  They become pieces moved about for the purpose of the plot too much. <br />This was a cute, fluffy book and it would have been so much more interesting and satisfying if it had a little bit more meat to it.	2001-08-10

In a land where seasons can last years, Eddard Stark is asked by his good friend King Robert to take a job at that has recently been vacated by Eddard's brother-in-law.  Reluctant because he does not like to become involved in royal politics, Eddard nevertheless agrees and moves his family to court.  Eddard quickly learns that his doubts were well founded.  There is more than meets the eye in this job and Eddard soon realizes that his predecessor was investigating areas that could prove very dangerous.  Court life is rife with plots, counter plots and power plays and the Stark family becomes ensnared in situations for which they are woefully unprepared.<br />Meanwhile half way around the world, Viserys and Daenerys, children of the previous king,  are plotting a triumphant return.  They view King Robert as nothing but a usurper and vow to raise an army to smash his kingdom.  Travelling through far-away sun-baked lands, Daenerys finds herself surrounded by strangers who may not have her best interests in mind; a brother whose ambitions may lead her into danger; and a series of events that leave her changed forever.<br />And, while the mere mortals are playing the game of thrones, up in the north, a legend has come to life.

Since that series was far from finished and I was still in an &quot;epic fantasy book&quot; mode, I was desperately casting around for something similar.  I happened across an on-line bboard that was discussing 'A Game of Thrones.'  The praise was universal and it seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for. So I found a copy and began to read.  It is only like &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; up to a point.  The similarities with WOT lie in the fact that 1) it is a multi-volume series and 2) it has lots of characters.

It is chock full of symbolism and foreshadowing. But it is also very grounded and down to earth.  This book has quite a large cast of characters.  It is a fully realized world with a history, customs, landscapes, legends and a wide range of people.  Yet, the story is told through the viewpoints of a very small, select number of  characters.  Through their eyes you get to see events unfold.  This has the wonderful effect of not only allowing you to get to know the character whose viewpoint you're reading at the time in a very intimate way, but also allows the author to reserve the right to revisit an event through the eyes of another character and thereby give the same event an entire new meaning for the reader.<br />Characters in this book are noble, evil, good, cynical, naïve and really, endearingly  flawed.  I have to applaud the author's willingness to sacrifice sympathetic characters as well as non-sympathetic ones.  He doesn't take the easy route and I think the book is all the richer for it.  I went back to reread this book after having read the 2nd and 3rd book of the series and I am pleased that it has held up beautifully to a reread.

I am amazed that this woman can be so prolific and yet manages to avoid being stale.  This is the third book of the Faerie trilogy set in Ireland.  It tells the story of the last Gallagher sibling, Darcy and her relationship with Irish-American entrepreneur Trevor McGee.  It also concludes the saga of Carrick and Gwen.<br />Is this book a tad formulaic?  Yes.  If you've read any of her other trilogies such as her &quot;Born In...&quot; series or her  &quot;...Dream&quot; series, you could pretty much tell how this trilogy would unfold. But that doesn't detract from the feeling of story well told after you've finished the series. Darcy is he kind of a heroine I always wanted to have when used to read Harlequins or Silhouette romances.  She is determined, ambitious and has a strong sense of herself.  She is sexy and sexual.  And she is unabashedly in love with her family.  My biggest quibble with this book is that I felt Darcy's character overshadowed Trevor's.  I kept asking myself &quot;Why would she love him except that he is handsome and has money?&quot;  I didn't get the sense of satisfaction from their relationship the way I did with Jude/Aidan or Brenna/Shawn. My biggest praise of this book, and especially of this series, is that the sense of family and familial feeling is really strong.  That is always a strong point in Nora Roberts' books and this one is no different.  A nice conclusion to a fine series.	2001-01-11

She would like to go home but she's afraid her aunt, the Queen of the Faeries will kill her. In the meantime she's holding down a job in L.A. in a paranormal detective agency and trying to lay low.  But her hiding place is ferreted out and she is summoned home.  Surprise, surprise Merry's aunt doesn't want to kill her but her plans for Merry make Merry think that a quick death may have been preferable. <br />I am a big fan of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.  I like the idea of a whole paranormal world existing alongside of, and with the full acknowledgement of, the everyday human world.  A Kiss of Shadows follows in this same vein as well.  The world of faeries and goblins and selkies (oh my) is brought to life in this series.  I can't help but make the inevitable comparisons to Anita Blake.  Like Anita, Merry is short, tough, sexy and is juggling  lot of men.  But that is where the comparison must end.  <br />While I liked A Kiss of Shadows, it had too much of a &quot;setting the stage&quot; feel for me to really enjoy it as a stand alone work.  There are some nice scenes and some wonderful action, but all too often the interesting stuff becomes interrupted and bogged down by passages heavy in  expositional detail.  Sometimes, I felt like I was reading a primer on faerie life.  Is this necessary so that the reader can obtain a good grounding in Merry's world so we know what we are dealing with?  Probably, but it almost feels like a protocol officer is whispering in my ear the do's and don'ts of the faerie world nd it comes off a bit clunky.  <br />I do plan to continue the series and hope that this first book got most of the laying the foundation stuff out of the way so that the other books can concentrate on more action, romance and drama.	2001-01-05

But marriage doesn't mean happily ever after for this couple because  higland politics vie with love as Alec finds himself sucked into the plot  to restore the Stuart throne.<br />I LOVED this book! and I plan to go right  out and read the sequel.  Yes, there are the inevitable comparisons to  Gabaldon's OUTLANDER series. I confess, I am even guilty of thinking  &quot;hey this book reminds me of Gabaldon's&quot; but I think in doing so  I do Ms. Givens a huge disservice.  There are pracically hundreds of books  out there written about handsome higlanders, pretty englishwomen and the  jacobite uprisings.  What makes this book seem like it is so similar to  Gabaldon's is because Ms. Givens 1) writes very well and 2) there is a bit  more complexity in her characters than one usually finds in most historical  romances.  I like how Robert Campbel, Mary's other suitor isn't made to  seem all evil or bufoonish or boring. Instead he is handsome, accomplished  and all too humanly flawed. I think it is great that Ms. Givens not only  manages to make her main characters lively, interesting and 3 dimensional,  but that she also can do this with secondary characters as well.  I look  forward to the sequel to this story (it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger) and  I definitely plan to keep my open for other books by this author.	2000-01-21

And for a vorcious reader who only read romance, that is a huge deal.  So when I saw the uniformly rave  reviews for this book, I decided to pick it up hoping that it would bring  back a little bit of that excitement I used to have for romance novels.   Boy was I disappointed.  First, I never felt that I 'knew' any of the 6  characters very well.  I guess one of the drawbacks of having 3 romances in  one book is that you really can't get too in depth with any one of them.   Second, they all fell in love with their respective partners in about 2  days.  Third, I felt these women were too easily accepting of the fact that  they were involved with men from 300 years ago.  I like a nice paranormal  romance as much as the next person (otherwise I wouldn't have even bothered  to pick up this book) but it got a bit too much for me when Delaney, the  last of the three Clairen women, didn't even blink when confronted with the  fact that she was in the presence of a ghost and an immortal man.  I  thought this book had a lot of potential and the idea of it is really  interesting.  But I think the execution of it was cliche and boring and the  ending was both illogial and too pat.	1999-12-03

I've read all of the Miles Vorkosigan books and I must say they just get better.  This book is classified as science fiction but it could have just as easily been called a romance or general fiction. <br />We find Miles where  we left off with him from the last book, 'Komarr', still helplessly  infautated with the lovely widow Ekaterin.  How appropriate that the title  of the book is 'a Civil Campaign' because Miles' courtship of the widow is  done in typical Miles style -- as a military campaign. And in typical Miles  fashion he is...overwhelming.  But before he can complete his strategy of  getting the girl Miles must vanquish a political foe intent upon damaging  his reputation by accusing him of murder.  Mark, Miles' troubled clone  brother, makes an appearance with a new friend whose new 'culinary'  invention creates havoc in the Vorkosigan household.  And in the meantime,  Miles still has to participate in all the tedious round of socializing that  preceeds Gregor's wedding.<br />There is so much stuff in this book that you  can't put it down.  Ms. Bujold introduces a couple of fascinating new  characters as well as reintroducing us to and enrichening some of our old  favorites.  <br />The highlights of this book are many, but I especially loved  Miles' comically doomed dinner party, Ivan's continued proof that he's no  idiot and the wonderfully satisfying clamatic scene at the Council of  Counts.  And I always cry at weddings!	1999-12-03

Claire, the Keeper, finds herself the caretaker of the Bed and  Breakfast from Hell. She inherits a sexy ghost, a guest in room six who has  been asleep for 40 years, a hunky caretaker who happens to be the most  trustworthy person in the world (&quot;Total strangers probably handed him  their packages while they bent to tie shoelaces&quot;),  and a gateway to  Hell in the basement. With the help of her smarter-than-you-or-me cat,  Austin, Claire deals with all of this plus the temptations of Hell and a  slew of interesting out-of-this world guests. The overnight visit of the  geriatric, ex-Olympic Gods and Goddesses is by itself worth a second read  (&quot;Aphrodite travels with more clothing than Ginger took on that 3 hour  cruise&quot;).<br />I sincerely hope this is the beginning of a series.  How  many other books out there can I read where Hell laments that no one knows  the classics anymore when his reference to Citizen Kane goes unrecognized?   I recommend.	1998-08-23

I've read Barbara Delinsky's books for years from her category romances to  her more recent mainstream fiction and she continues to deliver very  intelligent, contemporary reading.<br />The thing I like best of about this  novel is that we get to watch a man learn about a woman.  Even though Jack  has been married to Rachel for several years, is father to her two children  and has maintained a civil yet distant relationship with her for 6 years of  divorce, he really doesn't know this woman at all.  He has to learn about  her hopes, her dreams, her lifestyle, and simply about her through her  friends and her children.  The people themselves tell as much about Rachel  as their words and it is a nicely executed book that can pull off the  layers of a person slowly and allow such discovery.  Also in the process,  Jack discovers himself as well.  And he realizes, that although he might  not have known Rachel as well as he thought, she really knew him.<br />There  is a small subplot about a rebellious teenage daughter that adds a layer of  reality and texture to the story.  However, the semi-mystical moments that  involve the other daughter and the next door neighbor seem to be just  filler and add unecessary drama.<br />Overall a good read, which I recommend.	1998-08-23

Rather than sweeping along in the same high vein that ended the first book, this one moves at a very deliberate pace. There are some great stand-out moments in this book:  We meet the formidable Siuan Sanche, Lan takes over the role of male mentor for Rand, the Black Ajah makes an appearance, the Seachan invade, and the Horn of Valere is found.

The book jacket made it sound like it would be an adventurous read and it really was.<br />There are several stories going on in this book: Althea's quest to regain her ship, Kennit's quest to become a king of pirates, Ronica's quest to keep her family together, the serpents' quest for who-knows-what, the mystery of Paragon, the political intrigue surrounding Bingtown and, most compelling of all, Wintrow's story. All of these narratives are interwoven into one big,compelling, un-put-downable, can't-wait-for-the-next-volume, story.<br />Although it would appear that Althea's is the main story, I found the saga of Wintrow and Wintrow himself the most involving aspect of this book.  Ms. Hobb has created in Wintrow a likeable, tortured young man who undergoes a tempering that is wonderful and sometimes painful to watch.<br />I enjoyed how such unsypat! hetic characters as Kyle and Kennit were not created as simple cardboard villains, instead one is a man who truly thinks he is trying to do right for his family (no matter how obnoxious or wrongheaded he really is) and the other a man who is consumed by ambition and not a little bit of self hate.  <br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to the rest of the series with great anticipation.  I also plan to seek out Ms. Hobb's other series of books.	1998-07-21

It is a fast-paced page turner where each of our intrepid heroes and heroines are all involved in some important part of the plot. Unlike a couple of other books in this series that can read like travelogues, this one is brim full of action and revelation. A lot happens, the plot moves, questions are answered, (and even more are left unanswered), history of a people is discovered, destinies are revealed and a war is fought.  A very satisfying read that will keep you sated until you get to the next book.	1998-07-17

He whisks them away from their comfortable home, a small rural village called Emond's Field, and thrusts them out into an adventure.  He makes you like them and root for them and hope that, in the end, all of them -- Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene and Nynaeve -- make out ok.  You wonder if you can really trust Moiraine, the inscrutable Aes Sedai who promises to protect them.  You hope that the new friends they make on thier Journey -- Thom, Elayne, Loial -- also prove to be true.  <br />As the group becomes splintered and run from town to town, relentlessly pursued by monstrous beings, you can't help but wonder why?  How can these young people from one small village be so important? And who is that Lews Therin guy anyway? <br />With a humongous cast of characters, takin! g place over several different nations, populated with a wide array of cultures, this is a fun, messy, sprawling, engrossing series where you discover that these questions only just scratch the surface and you'll have many more.  The great thing about this series is how so very *human* these people all are. While we readily expect ego, pride and base desires amongst the &quot;bad guys&quot;, we also find that these all too human flaws are present among the &quot;good guys&quot;.  There are political intrigues, people jockeying for power, the &quot;I know I'm doing what's right&quot; self-righteous types (even if it really isn't), lack of communication, people working at cross purposes, mistrust,bad assumptions, prejudices, hatreds, war, sex, good old-fashioned &quot;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&quot; jealousy, prophecies, religious zealots, the inevitable whackos who surface during any turmoil, magic, insanity and just plain old Evil.<br />While this series (8 books and!  counting) inevitably has some books that are better than o! thers, it is definitely worth the effort to read, re-read, re-read again and enjoy.	1998-07-17

I am thoroughly enjoying the whole &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series.  When an author creates one long tale that is spread out over several books, inevitably there are some books in the series that are stronger than others. I would classify ACOS as one of the weaker books of the series. I must qualify this by saying that I am hopelessly in thrall to this series and even a &quot;weaker&quot; book still manages to captivate me.  Still, this one had the feel of set-up rather than of moving forward.  Even though i had waited two years for this one to come out, while reading it, I felt as if I were still waiting.  It is a curious feeling to read a book and still feel as if I were waiting for it to happen. On the upside I am intrigued by two new characters, Cadsuane and Moridin.  On the downside Rand's confrontation with Sammael seemed almost anticlimactic, it had the effect of a whimper when I expected a bang. I am vey much looking forward to &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot; h! oping that this book moves a little better than 'A Crown of Swords&quot; did.	1998-07-17

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good writing &amp; a strong main character = a good read.	Samone Lewis really wants to marry her boyfriend of 4 years.  Problem is, Max won't commit.  In the midst of her relationship woes comes Jon Everette. Jon is friendly and funny and...white.  Samone, who is black, has issues with an interracial relationship.  Somehow, though, her objections falter in the face of her attraction to Jon.  The two become friends and then lovers.  But in the meantime, both struggle to bury the ghosts of their respective previous relationships.  I enjoyed this book.  I liked how the author puts pen to paper.  I liked her choice of words, her descriptions, her way of placing me into the setting of this book.  I really felt Samone's frustration of her relationships, her sorrow over her bad choices, her dislike of her job and just how she lives day-to-day in the hustle and bustle of New York City.  She really does leap off the page as a fully formed, believable, REAL character.  She is presented as a sympathetic person who has some very real character flaws.  Just like you or me.  The reason I think this a good book, but not a great one is because I think that all the other characters get short shrift.  While Ms. Johnson-Hodge does an excellent job of getting me into Samone's head and allowing me to know exactly where she is coming from, I had to fill in the blanks on the other characters.  I really wanted to know more about Max and especially Jon.    Why did Samone love Max so much that he stops her in her tracks?  Why does Jon like Samone so much considering the fact that she seems to direct so much angst his way? I wanted Max and Jon to be just as real and vibrant as Samone and they simply weren't. If these two were more fleshed and I knew more of their hopes, dreams and motivations like I did Samone's, this could have easily been a '10'.  I absolutely believe that Ms. Johnson-Hodge is a good writer and has many more stories to tell and I will definitely be on the look-out for them.	1998-04-20
