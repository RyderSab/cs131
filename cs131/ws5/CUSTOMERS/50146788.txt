He also focuses in on the specific structural features of modern life that made psychoanalysis an especially successful ideology.<br /><br />As Gellner sums up in his final chapter, \\"In a sense, the present book is more interested in our Zeitgeist than in psychoanalysis. The crucial strategic position occupied by Freudianism in the social and intellectual history of mankind, makes it possible for us to learn a vast amount from it about, on the one hand, the general anatomy of belief systems and, on the other, the special conditions prevalent in our age.\\"<br /><br />In his first two chapters, Gellner focuses in on what might be called the modern predicament.  Before the rise of natural science and philosophical empiricism, it was easy to explain the mixture of good and evil, the sheer perversity, embodied in human beings.  Humans were, quite literally, halfway between beasts and angels.<br /><br />The rise of science and modern philosophy invalidated that belief.  Taking David Hume as a prime example, Gellner shows that the scientific, empiricist thought of the Enlightenment abandoned the angel/beast dichotomy.  The Enlightenment theorists naturalized man: the model of man they ended up with, which Gellner dubs the \\"Bundleman,\\" was a random mixture of self-interested desires and needs which were easily satisfied by a conservatively cautious policy of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain.<br /><br />Real human beings, of course, act much more like a mixture of angel and beast than the cautiously and rationally selfish \\"Bundleman\\" of the Enlightenment.<br /><br />Nietzsche was, Gellner claims, the first serious post-Enlightenment thinker to fully realize this fact, and the realization finally drove poor Nietzsche insane.<br /><br />Freud's genius was to take the Nietzschean insight and domesticate it, thereby turning it into the basis of a very successful, very lucrative pseudo-scientific cult - psychoanalysis.<br /><br />Freud's task was made easier by certain features of the modern world.  The modern world exhibits deep reverence for applied science, especially medicine. In modern industrial societies, technology has eradicated most traditional physical threats (starvation, plague, wild animals, etc.).  In our society, the pressing threats perceived by most people lie rather in the increasing complexity of, and importance placed upon, human relationships.  It is just in this area of interpersonal relationships where psychoanalysis offered help.<br /><br />Most of the book explores the tricks and turns by which psychoanalysis maintained its authority.  Nowadays, now that there is hardly an intelligent person left who is a hard-core believer in the Freudian faith, is this of any more than historical interest?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />While Freud may finally be buried, his residue endures -- as \\"therapy,\\" \\"couselling,\\" \\"adjustment,\\" etc. -- and continues to muddle our thinking process and our ability to make moral evaluations. As Gellner rhetorically asks, concerning the Holy Grail of \\"adjustment,\\" \\"[I]s adaptation, adjustment to any regime, including a tyrannical one, a sign of mental health?\\"  The Soviets, hardly orthodox Freudians, famously answered \\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />But even more important, as Gellner emphasizes, the fraud of Freudianism is a typical example of the functioning of human society in general:<br /><br />\\"Societies possess techniques for rendering ideas socially constitutive, and these techniques tend to share certain formal features.  It is important to remember that this is the normal condition of mankind: most ideas of most men at most times are beyond the reach of questioning... An idea does not have simply a cognitive role...it is at the same time linked to a set of personal relations,to loyalties, hierarchies, sentiments, hopes and fears.  To shake the idea would be to disturb all that.  Most men are neither willing nor able to do that.\\"<br /><br />To put it more bluntly, the structure of all hitherto existing human societies is grounded in socially-imposed, emotionally-compelling lies.<br /><br />Did Freud and his colleagues engage in bizarre intellectual contortions to prevent their ideas from being questioned or subjected to criticism?<br /><br />Yes... but have you ever asked a liberal why we must slavishly accede to the results of a democratic election?  The answer is that if you choose to vote, you are obliged to accept the results, and, if you don't vote, you have no right to complain.  Is Freudian reasoning any more circular than that?<br /><br />Did Freud and his colleagues frantically avoid confronting their theories with empirical reality?  (Freud once declared that \\"I cannot advise too strongly against\\" seeking out empirical evidence to check the conclusions of a psychoanalytic diagnosis because the result would be that \\"confidence in the analysis is shattered and a court of appeal is set up over it.\\")<br /><br />Yes... but have you ever talked with a conservative about the actual historical process by which the US Constitution was \\"ratified\\"?<br /><br />Do Freudians apply different standards to themselves than to all other human beings, accusing critics and skeptics of being mentally and morally deranged?<br /><br />Yes... but have you ever tried asking a Christian why, since they preach that Jesus taught the pacifist doctrines of \\"Resist not evil!\\" and \\"Turn the other cheek!\\", many Christians are among the most violent and militaristic people on the planet?<br /><br />What then would happen if everyone learned the central lesson of Gellner's book -- that deception, dishonesty, and manipulation are at the heart not only of the psychoanalytic movement but of nearly all forms of social authority?<br /><br />If people simply cease believing in authority, them, like Tinkerbell, authority simply dies.<br /><br />If the world were free of lies, deception, and manipulation, then the authority of clergymen and governments, of judges, schoolteachers, psychotherapists, professors, and policemen, would all simply disappear.<br /><br />Garbagemen can still collect garbage, farmers can still farm, and deliverymen can still deliver even if no one \\"believes' in them.

US	50146788	RCIS23R8M98FK	0385500610	994003380	The Twilight of Atheism: The Rise and Fall of Disbelief in the Modern World	Books	2	83	133	N	N	Twilight or Triumph?	<br />This is a frivolous book about what should be a serious subject. <br /> <br />As a scientist myself, I was most shocked at the extreme ignorance and actual errors McGrath displayed in his discussions of the relationship between science and religion.   <br /> <br />Most disturbing to me as a physicist was his falsehood concerning Einstein's general theory of relativity.  McGrath states that the gravitational redshift predicted by Einstein \\"was due to the reduction of the velocity of light by the mass of the sun.\\"   <br /> <br />No.  In reality, light slows down quite dramatically in passing from, for example, air into glass - this reduction in speed does not result in a redshift at all.  The gravitational redshift is due not to a change in velocity but to a slowing down of time deep in a gravitational field.   <br /> <br />Similarly, McGrath tries to argue that a belief in theism is quite common among scientists - unfortunately, all of the eminent scientific theists he lists seem to be dead!  In fact, as Natalie Angier reported in the New York Times in 2001, among \\"members of the National Academy of Sciences, an elite coterie if ever there was one, belief in a personal God was 7 percent, the flip of the American public at large.\\"  <br /> <br />McGrath also wants us to believe that science has nothing to say about the claims of religion.  This is nonsense.  There is no such thing as \\"religion-in-general,\\" but only specific religions such as Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, etc. Notoriously, those specific religions have historically claimed to make very specific factual claims about actual events in the real world - the Creation of the world, the location of heaven, etc.   <br /> <br />Science investigates the same sort of factual claims about reality, and, over and over again, has proven that the claims of religion are false.   <br /> <br />While I am most shocked by McGrath's misconduct on matters relating to my own professional expertise, he hardly does betterin other areas of thought.   <br /> <br />For example, he tries to present a general philosophical argument along the lines that, since the existence of God can be neither proven nor disproven, atheism and theism are equally plausible.   <br /> <br />That's silly.  There is prima facie evidence against the existence of a benevolent God who oversees the universe: for example, the AIDS virus or the tragic tsunami that recently killed so many around the Indian Ocean are not what one would expect if we are being watched over by God.  Of course, this prima facie evidence against God might be counterbalanced by positive evidence in favor of God's existence, but theists have yet to offer such evidence.   <br /> <br />More broadly, when incredible claims are not backed by credible evidence, no honest person can accept that the incredible claims are true. Traditional religions certainly make incredible claims.  For example, Christianity claims that the Incarnation, the Virgin birth, the Resurrection, etc. actually happened.  For centuries, the New Testament was offered as credible evidence to back those claims.  But we now know far too much about how the New Testament was constructed, about internal contradictions in the New Testament, about comparative religion, and about the general human propensity to believe our own fabrications to any longer take the New Testament seriously as historical evidence (see, e.g., Wells' \\"Jesus of the Early Christians,\\" Ehrman's \\"Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium,\\" Price's \\"Incredible Shrinking Son of Man,\\" etc.).   <br /> <br />There is no credible evidence available for the incredible claims made by Christians (or Moslems, Hindus, etc.).   <br /> <br />Perhaps, McGrath's most serious error is his insistence on seeing an organized \\"atheist movement\\" and a coherent \\"atheist vision\\" which simply do not exist.   <br /> <br />He ends the book by discussing the need \\"to assess the attraction of the atheist vision.\\"  In fact, atheism implies that the universe does not have a \\"vision.\\"   <br /> <br />Most bizarrely, McGrath declares, \\"In its modern forms, [atheism] is unquestionably one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect...\\"   <br /> <br />The basic problem is, I think, the fallacy of negative definition: when one defines something by what it is not, it is unreasonable to believe that one has defined a coherent unity.  As McGrath concedes, \\"Atheist writers of the nineteenth century often defined their position in terms of an absence - rather than a denial - of a belief in God...\\"  Such an absence of belief, still the preferred definition of most atheists, is simply a negative criterion: it does not tell what specific atheists believe, and it provides no reason to expect that atheists will comprise an organized movement with a single coherent ideology.   <br /> <br />Indeed, there is, contra McGrath, no such movement and no such ideology: an atheist is simply anyone who is free of religion.   <br /> <br />Just as it is silly to think that all non-Hindus in the world or all non-Moslems form a unified movement with a uniform \\"vision,\\" so it is equally silly to think that non-theists make up a unified movement with an \\"atheist vision.\\"   <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book, McGrath is actually reduced to relying on the oft-refuted left-wing academic pseudo-philosophy of postmodernism to attack atheists (see Gellner's \\"Postmodernism, Reason and Religion \\" for a more thoughtful view).  <br /> <br />Are we then in the \\"twilight\\" of atheism?  Nearly all eminent scientists now living are atheists; orthodox religious believers are a distinct minority in almost every serious intellectual discipline; even some Christian clergymen are atheists, as demonstrated by the Anglican \\"Sea of Faith Network,\\" formed for clergymen who no longer believe in God!   <br /> <br />McGrath shows that some crack-pot pseudo-intellectuals who were non-believers (notably Marx, Freud and de Sade) are now out of fashion (and rightly so).  And, religion of course retains, in places, serious political influence and continues to impact the lives of the ignorant and uneducated.   <br /> <br />But, in terms of our best contemporary understanding of the nature of reality and our greatest contemporary intellectual achievements, in terms of the honest thought of serious, intelligent, well-educated people, we live not in the twilight of atheism but in the time of atheism's greatest triumphs.   <br /> <br />	2005-06-23
US	50146788	R2T5GRUGBE7EN0	0300104367	716080865	Leo Strauss and the Politics of American Empire	Books	5	96	123	N	N	Joyfully dissecting the neocons	I felt a certain guilty pleasure reading Anne Norton's \\"Leo Strauss and the Politics of American Empire.\\"  The book is just too much fun - especially the juicy little tidbits of gossip about some of the crazier Straussians.   <br /> <br />And, yet, the book has several serious, important points to make.   <br /> <br />I myself entitled a review of Strauss's \\"The City and Man\\" (posted here on amazon six months before Norton's book was published) as \\"Strauss vs. the 'Straussians'.\\"  My point was that Strauss's own published writings directly and dramatically contradicted the positions and policies espoused by his supposed followers, the \\"neoconservative\\" Straussians, who now control the foreign policy of the United States of America.   <br /> <br />This is one of the central themes of Norton's book.  She distinguishes between Struass's \\"students\\" and his \\"disciples.\\"  The \\"students\\" were interested in learning what Strauss and his colleagues had to teach and then moving on in their own direction.  The \\"disciples\\" were part of a bizarre cult.   <br /> <br />As a student herself at the University of Chicago, in effect the headquarters of the Straussian movement, Norton had a chance to get to know both \\"students\\" and \\"disciples.\\"   <br /> <br />One telling anecdote about the Straussian Allan Bloom, famed author of \\"The Closing of the American Mind,\\" reveals the internal dynamics of a cult: <br /> <br />\\"Bloom himself liked to play little games with his puppies [his students].  'He was tossing pennies down the hall, and his students were scurrying to pick them up off the floor,' my friend Peter Agree told me.  `He was laughing.'\\" <br /> <br />Bloom's \\"Closing of the American Mind\\" became an instant manifesto for conservative, traditional values when it was published in 1987.  And, yet, Norton explains: <br /> <br />\\"The defender of youthful innocence, family values, and traditional morality was a homosexual - and not just any homosexual, either.  If Bloom's students wereto be trusted, Bloom's antics gave new meaning to the term 'transgression.'  The rumors of houseboys in sexual servitude, the evident flirtations with students, Bloom's flamboyantly queenly manner made 'The Closing of the American Mind' read as high hypocrisy...\\"  Norton adds that all this was \\"readily acknowledged\\" (though not in print) by Bloom's \\"colleagues, friends, and students.\\"   <br /> <br />When I read Bloom's book back in 1988, although I agreed with much of Bloom's cultural criticism, I sensed something was wrong: there was too much enthusiasm for \\"eros\\" and too little for the norm of calm, disinterested truth.  Indeed, if I understood the book correctly, the only real reason for human society was to produce more people just like... Allan Bloom.   <br /> <br />Clearly, I didn't know the half of it.   <br /> <br />But the psychological dynamics of cults provides only one piece of the explanation for the neoconservative Straussians who now control American foreign policy.   <br /> <br />Perhaps a greater factor is revealed in an anecdote Norton tells of Zalmay Khalilzad, the new Bush Administration ambassador to Iraq:  <br /> <br />\\"When I knew him, he was an Afghani graduate student and a radical.  He boasted of the demonstrations he had organized in Beirut, of the fedayin he knew and had worked with, and of his friends who regularly visited Libyan President Muammar Qaddafi.  He went to pro-Palestinian meetings.  His room had a poster of Nasser...\\"   <br /> <br />But, one happy day, Khalilzad and Norton were invited to a lavish party at the luxury apartment of a professor, Albert Wohlstetter, who had done very nicely for himself monetarily by working for the US defense establishment.  The experience, Norton claims, altered Khalilzad's life: Khalilzad was \\"enthralled by Wohlstetter's party.  In the elevator, in the apartment, he kept saying how much it all cost, how expensive it was, how much money Wohlstetter must have.\\"  In due course, Wohlstetter helpedKhalilzad turn his back on his Third-World radicalism and find a cushy spot in the American establishment.   <br /> <br />Anyone who has followed the financial success of the leading neocon Straussians knows that this story is hardly an isolated case: one conservative critic has renamed the famed neoconservative Richard Perle as \\"Richer Perle,\\" in honor of the lucrative financial shenanigans that forced Perle to surrender his position as chairman of the Defense Policy Board.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the most important argument Norton offers is that the neocon \\"Straussians\\" (although not Strauss himself) are anti-Semitic bigots.  This may seem an odd accusation since many of the Straussians are Jewish. However, Norton points out, not only Jews are Semites: Arabs also are Semites. As she declares: <br /> <br />\\"From the time I first came to Chicago to the present day, I have seen Arabs and Muslims made the targets of unrestrained persecution, especially among the Straussians.  At school, Straussian students told me that Arabs were dirty, they were animals, they were vermin.\\" <br /> <br />She adds that David Frum's and Richard Perle's recent book, \\"An End to Evil,\\" \\"has a strange familiarity about it.  Scholars familiar with the language of anti-Semitism will find it reminiscent of older, long-dishonored texts.  The careful fabrication, the language of blood-libel, the calls for violence in the name of defense, all are present here.\\"   <br /> <br />Finally, Norton emphasizes that the evils of Straussian neoconsertvatism are not characteristics of true conservatism.  Although she is not herself a conservative, in a chapter entitled \\"Conservatism Abandoned,\\" she brilliantly and sympathetically explains that, while conservatives have differed among themselves on a host of issues, on one key point they stood together: \\"Conservatives united in the desire for smaller government and on the belief that taxes should - if they existed at all - be very low.\\"   <br /> <br />But, thanks to the neocons' exploitation of the 9/11 catastrophe, Norton adds, \\"All this changed as the twentieth century ended.  American conservatism embraced big government with a vengeance.\\"  She cites chapter and verse: everything from the petty harassment to which Americans are now subject by the flunkies in the \\"Transportation Safety Administration\\" to the violation of basic civil liberties (such as habeas corpus), the huge federal deficit, and the ongoing campaign to conquer the world.  The Straussian neocons, Norton concludes, \\"are not preservers; they are (as they will tell you) revolutionaries.\\"   <br /> <br />Yes, indeed. <br />	2005-06-23

First, the nuclear obliteration of  Hiroshima and Nagasaki was necessary to bring about the immediate and full surrender of  the Japanese government.  Second, it was therefore morally justified.  <br /> <br />Newman makes a plausible case that the surrender terms publicly demanded by the American government could only be achieved by the atomic bombings.  (American demands were summed up by American officials in the shibboleth \\"unconditional surrender.\\")  Newman concedes that \\"the Japanese air force and navy were in tatters\\" and that the emperor and a number of civilian government leaders were desperate to end the war.  But, Newman argues, the bitter-enders in the Japanese military who controlled the government were unwilling to accept America's surrender terms.  And, the courage and tenacity of Japanese soldiers, as exhibited in the battle for Okinawa, meant that a final ground assault on the home islands would be devastatingly bloody.   <br /> <br />But, even if the nuclear obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary to bring about \\"unconditional\\" Japanese surrender, does this mean that that the bombings were morally justified?   <br /> <br />A fundamental principle of morality is that even noble goals do not justify evil means.  Intentional targeting of civilian populations is a violation of the laws of war -- whether or not it advances the goals of the war.  This was recognized by civilized countries, prior to the Second World War.  As Newman himself acknowledges, \\"The Fourth Hague Convention (1907), which was adopted by most Western nations, forbids any bombardment of undefended towns...\\"  Accordingly, as Newman goes on to explain, \\"At the beginning of World War II, both Churchill and Roosevelt endorsed the principle of noncombatant immunity, and for a while Allied bombers attempted precision bombing of military and industrial targets\\" as required by international law.  But, after a while, this became inconvenient, so the Allies forgot about the laws of civilized warfare and started purposefully targeting civilians.   <br /> <br />The atomic bombings were merely the final acts of barbarism on the part of the Allies.   <br /> <br />But, in evaluating the justice of the bombings, one should go beyond abstract principles of international morality and look at the concrete motives and causes of the war.    <br /> <br />Japan went to war because it correctly felt that the United States was creating an economic stranglehold to prevent Japan from carrying out an imperialist policy modeled on the policies of the United States itself (e.g., in the Philippines: see Stuart Creighton Miller's \\"Benevolent Assimilation\\") and of America's imperialist allies, such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands.  Indeed, prior to Pearl Harbor, the United States had committed itself to going to war against Japan if Japan moved against British or Dutch possessions in Asia, even if Japan did not attack US forces (the so-called ABD agreement).   <br /> <br />The Japanese imperialists were, of course, guilty of serious, brutal atrocities, but so also were British imperialists, Belgian imperialists, etc.   <br /> <br />As Newman puts it, \\"Japan was merely following their [the Western powers'] example, but then the Western powers wanted to change the rules.  Western leaders did indeed want to change the rules.\\" <br /> <br />Indeed.   <br /> <br />The ultimate cause of the nuclear incineration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the decision by the American Administration, before Pearl Harbor, that non-Caucasians, such as the Japanese, must not be allowed to play the imperialist game which the Caucasian powers themselves had so greatly enjoyed.   <br /> <br />Was then the murder of the inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki solely due to racism?   <br /> <br />That raises other key questions.  Why, even given America's goal of limiting Japanese imperialist expansion, was Japanese \\"unconditional\\" surrender actually necessary in 1945?  Why was not a negotiated peace possible which would curtail Japanese imperial reach without an actual occupation and \\"unconditional\\" surrender of Japan?  Japan was already reeling militarily; the United States had already succeeded in its pre-war goal of cutting off Japanese access to strategic vital resources.   <br /> <br />Newman himself lays out four conditions which he claims would have made surrender readily acceptable even to the bitter-enders in the Japanese military: \\"no change in the government, no occupation of the home islands, Japanese troops to disarm themselves, and Japan to conduct any war crimes trials.\\"   <br /> <br />Why not?  Numerous wars throughout history have been ended on similar terms.  <br /> <br />Part of the answer is no doubt domestic American politics.  Having maneuvered the Japanese into the \\"sneak attack\\" against Pearl Harbor and having churned out viciously racist propaganda portraying the Japanese as a subhuman demon breed, the American government could hardly turn around and admit that the whole affair had merely been a sordid struggle over the boundaries of imperial spheres of influence.   <br /> <br />More broadly, from a world perspective, the twentieth century was the story of the rise of the United States of America from being an insignificant player on the world stage to being the sole world hegemon.   <br /> <br />America has come to view itself as the redeemer nation, the secular Messiah that will bring the Millennium to all mankind, the \\"first universal nation,\\" to use the grandiose phrase favored by some neoconservatives.   <br /> <br />To work out a negotiated peace with the Japanese on the basis of sordid concerns of conflicting national interests would have sullied America's self-image as the shining Savior of Mankind.  In an act of grotesque religious blasphemy, the United States has taken upon itself the role of Jesus Christ.   <br /> <br />So, yes, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima andNagasaki was necessary.  It was necessary to advance the American messianic mission, necessary to advance the untrammeled world-wide power of America's ruling elites, and necessary to create a world empire through which the permissive, materialist, amoral values of the United States can be forcibly imposed on the entire Earth.   <br /> <br />And, someday, I fear, by the same impeccable logic the rest of the human race will conclude that the nuclear incineration of a half-dozen American cities is \\"necessary\\" to free the human race from the American imperium.   <br /> <br />As Thomas Jefferson once said, \\"I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.\\" <br />	2004-09-05
US	50146788	R1UBNTQDZLGWSW	0618335404	851888004	A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love	Books	4	29	42	N	N	An attack on religion	In his opening essay, Richard Dawkins offers what he calls \\"a call to arms\\" against the reality of evolution: \\"I prefer to fight against...natural selection...as a human being...We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators [i.e., our genes].\\"  <br /> <br />This is surely an odd affirmation of faith for the man who made famous the concept of \\"the selfish gene,\\" the title of Dawkins' first book.  In that book, Dawkins demonstrated convincingly that what natural selection selects for is not the good of the biosphere, the ecosystem, the species, or even the individual organism, but only the reproductive advantage of individual genes.  In the words Dawkins used in \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" our genes \\"created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence...we are their survival machines.\\" <br /> <br />In \\"A Devil's Chaplain,\\" Dawkins argues that his call to struggle against the force of natural selection does not contradict his intellectual belief in the selfish gene: \\"There is no inconsistency in favoring Darwinism as an academic scientist while opposing it as a human being; any more than there is inconsistency in explaining cancer as an academic doctor while fighting it as a practising one.\\"   <br /> <br />This analogy with cancer fails: a theory of oncogenesis is not all-encompassing -- it only explains cancer, it does not explain all of biology, including all of human action.  But Dawkins' selfish gene concept is all-encompassing.  It claims to explain all of biological life, including humans.  There is no exit offered.   <br /> <br />In concrete terms, if Dawkins devotes some of his time and energy to struggling against the more nasty consequences of natural selection and if I passively accept the consequences of natural selection and instead focus on advancing my children's reproductive success, my genes will tend to be more successful replicators than Dawkins'.   <br /> <br />Natural selection, by Dawkins' own analysis, will reward those of us who do not waste our time struggling against natural selection.   <br /> <br />There is a conceivable way out.  Suppose our oversized brain gives us direct contact with some \\"higher realm,\\" a Platonic realm of moral ideals, a religious realm of Divine inspiration, etc.  If such non-physical powers can influence our behavior, then perhaps we can respond to Dawkins' \\"call to arms\\" after all.   <br /> <br />However, in one of the essays in the book, \\"Viruses of the Mind,\\" Dawkins makes clear he will have none of that.  He argues that religious belief is a sign of an \\"infected mind,\\" claims that the explanation of religion is \\"epidemiological,\\" and gives a list of symptoms of this particular mental disease.    <br /> <br />Indeed, the book simply reeks of hostility to religion.   <br /> <br />Why? <br /> <br />Casual observation suggests that religious believers tend to have more kids than skeptics: whatever the innate character traits that incline one towards belief in religion, these traits seem to be favored by natural selection.   <br /> <br />It is easy to come up with a possible explanation.  The anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski noted long ago that, even in primitive societies, religion is used only in situations where one does not understand or cannot control events.  Religion allows people to concentrate on those matters they can actually affect and leave the rest to the gods.  Religion lets people direct their attention and channel their anxiety efficiently.   <br /> <br />Dawkins does not consider this.  Instead, he focuses on the -- very real -- conflict and destruction wrought by the Judaic religions -- Judaism, Islam, and Christianity (he ignores the less aggressive East Asian religions, such as Buddhism).   <br /> <br />Much of Dawkins' animus against religion seems to be based on the fact that the argument for God based on the intricate \\"design\\" of biological organisms is refuted by the fact of evolution.  He's right -- but there are other serious arguments for the existence of God: philosophical arguments on the nature of consciousness, logical necessity, and causation; scientific arguments concerning the existence of the universe, the \\"fine-tuning\\" of the constants of nature; etc. (see, e.g., the fascinating debate between Smart and Haldane in their \\"Atheism and Theism.\\")   <br /> <br />Taking all the arguments into account, I myself doubt that God exists.  But it is not a simple question. <br /> <br />Dawkins does argue passionately that we must at least stop lying.  Adults routinely lie to their children about everything from Santa Claus to God to the actions of government and the realities of war.  Dawkins argues that children are uniquely susceptible to propaganda and often find it difficult to escape from the lies they were fed as children even when they are well into adulthood.   <br /> <br />He's right.  But perhaps his focus is slightly off: at least in the last century, it is the child-like belief in nationalism, militarism, socialism, democracy, and imperialism which has produced far more suffering than blind religious faith.  It is worship of government, not worship of God, which nearly destroyed civilization during the twentieth century.   <br /> <br />In concrete terms, who is the greater monster, Joseph Stalin or Pope John Paul II?   <br /> <br />Dawkins' anti-religious animus leads him to an uncharacteristic intolerance in dealing with the evolution/creationist controversy -- on one occasion, he explains, he nearly threw an interviewer out of his home when he found out that the interviewer was a creationist (the interviewer had travelled all the way from Australia based on Dawkins' agreeing to be interviewed).  Dawkins explains that he refuses ever to debate creationists \\"because...just to appear on the platform with them is to lend them the respectability they crave.\\"   <br /> <br />That's a shame.  Evolution is true.  The evidence for evolution comesnot only from biology and paleontology but also geology and nuclear physics (so-called radiometric dating of the fossil record).  Creationists are attacking all of science, but it is hard for members of the general public to understand this if scientists of Dawkins stature refuse to refute the creationists.   <br /> <br />\\"A Devil's Chaplain\\" is eloquent, readable, and interesting.  If it occasionally slips into contradictions, these are contradictions that should provoke the reader to rethink his or her own beliefs and intellectual preconceptions.   <br />	2004-08-20
US	50146788	R5ILUCJLUPLA	1573928097	317628734	An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard	Books	5	133	138	N	N	Let us live to make men free	<br /> I first heard of Murray Rothbard in 1970 when I was a high-school student researching the Depression. My kid brother pulled Rothbard's &quot;America's Great Depression&quot; off the shelf of our local public library and suggested I might find it useful.  <br />  <br /> I was at the age where I was exploring a variety of political perspectives, from John Kenneth Galbraith to Ayn Rand, but I soon recognized that Rothbard was unique.  <br />  <br /> It was only in the late '70s, as a graduate student at Stanford, that I actually had a chance to meet Rothbard in person. At the time, the national libertarian movement (the Cato Institute, the Center for Libertarian Studies, the Institute for Humane Studies, etc.) had, for various reasons, come to be based in the San Francisco Bay Area, near Stanford, and I had a chance to meet not only Rothabrd but a number of other leading figures in the movement, including Justin Raimondo, the author of this biography of Rothbard.  <br />  <br /> I was thus peripherally involved in some of the incidents described in this book -- for example, I was a member of the &quot;Radical Caucus,&quot; founded by Rainmondo and led by Rothbard. I can therefore testify that, as far as my personal knowledge is concerned, Raimondo has reported accurately, even where he himself differed from Rothbard (for example, on the 1984 Presidential campaign, when Rothbard and I were on the opposite side from Raimondo).  <br />  <br /> Above all, Raimondo paints an accurate picture of Rothbard as a person: Rothbard was joyously ebullient, voraciously curious, and, while politically passionate, always a gentleman. Over the years, I myself differed from Rothbard on a number of issues -- ranging from intellectual property law to policy in Central America -- but I know of no case in which Rothbard ever behaved in a dishonorable manner.  <br />  <br /> Rothbard reoriented the thinking of those in our generation who had a serious interest in issues of politicalphilosophy and government. He differed from other advocates of individual rights and limited government in that he combined a rigorously logical understanding of the structure of human rights with an unflinchingly detailed empirical understanding of human history.  <br />  <br /> He taught us three central lessons:  <br />  <br /> 1. Government -- all governments everywhere -- exists to enable some human beings to control and manipulate other human beings. While an occasional purpose of government is to interfere with others' private lives and control their ideas and/or values, the overarching purpose of government is to enable some people to live at the expense of others via taxation, forced labor, etc.  <br />  <br /> 2. The history of humankind is therefore the record of the struggle between Liberty and Power, between those humans who simply wish to be left alone to live their lives in peace and those who wish to control other human beings. Historians who portray the past as primarily consensus rather than conflict or as the inevitable triumph of impersonal, progressive social forces are lying apologists for tyranny.  <br />  <br /> 3. War is, above all, the means by which government expands its power, not simply by seizing the population and territory of other states but, more importantly, as a means of intensifying and deepening its control of its own populace -- curtailing civil liberties, whipping up nationalist hysteria, increasing the burden of taxation, etc. You cannot favor individual rights, private property, and free markets and also favor war.  <br />  <br /> Of course, these lessons were, to a large degree, as Rothbard himself recognized, simply a matter of relearning the lessons of the radical liberals of the nineteenth century, of the Jeffersonian wing of the American founding, and of the founding libertarians (such as John Lilburne and the American Roger Williams) of the seventeenth-century English Revolution. But Rothbard presented these lessons in a clearer and more straightforward manner, backed by a wealth of historical understanding, than ever before.  <br />  <br /> For those of us previously exposed to the &quot;conservatism&quot; of William F. Buckley and his &quot;New Right&quot; circle (Buckley actually advocated, in his own words, a &quot;totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores...&quot; to pursue the war against international Communism!) or the &quot;laissez-faire capitalism&quot; of Ayn Rand (who argued that government was basically legitimate but that government somehow always ended up mysteriously diverted from its legitimate purpose), Rothbard came as a clarifying thunderclap out of the blue.  <br />  <br /> The Randians did not much care about history (Rand's &quot;history&quot; of philosophy was a cartoonish caricature) and the &quot;conservatives&quot; had little interest in either rigorous thinking or critical history. Rothbard, on the contrary, demanded that we pursue a serious study of economic theory, of the ethics of natural rights, and of the actual events of Western history.  <br />  <br /> In 1965, Rothbard predicted the collapse of the Soviet empire: based on his knowledge as an economist, he recognized that socialism could not succeed, and, using his knowledge of intellectual history, he predicted that the ideas of Locke and Jefferson, would, in the end, defeat the ideas of Marx and Lenin.  <br />  <br /> In the final years of his life, after the Soviet Empire had been swept into the dustbin of history, Rothbard correctly foresaw that the struggle over American imperialism would become the primary focus of world affairs, as is now clear to everyone in the wake of the &quot;Bush doctrine&quot; and the American attempt to conquer the Mideast.  <br />  <br /> As Raimondo discusses in detail, Rothbard pursued a variety of political alliances over the years, always with the goal of advancing his central aim, the freedom of the individual human being. Building on the great legacy of Western liberalism, Rothbard has left us an overarching framework, a powerful set of intellectual tools, for understanding the process of domination and exploitation, and ultimately, for bringing about the triumph of human freedom.  <br />  <br /> It is now up to us to further hone those tools and to learn to apply them to strip away the mask of Power and restore the natural rights of human beings both here in America and throughout the world.  <br />	2004-07-21

Jesus was, you see, really a regular guy, with attitudes and values pretty much like yours and mine, the sort of fellow who would be welcome in any Kiwanis group or at any company picnic.  After all, didn't Jesus really invent the concept of being a \\"team player\\"?      In this book, Shadia Drury offers a loud dissent from this contemporary consensus about Jesus.  She insists on looking closely and honestly at the words of Jesus quoted in the New Testament and thinking carefully about their implications.      In short, Drury refuses to turn Jesus into simply one of history's more successful motivational speakers.      Citing chapter and verse in detail from Jesus himself (Luke 11:23 -- \\"All those who are not with me are against me\\"; John 14:6 -- \\"No man cometh unto the Father but by me\\"; Matthew 25:41 -- \\"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire\\"; etc.), Drury declares that Jesus \\"has all the qualities of a zealot -- immoderate, intransigent, uncompromising and autocratic...\\" She concludes, \\"His singular and autocratic character is reflected in the doctrine of sin as unbelief; his vindictive side is reflected in the doctrine of hell and damantion.\\"       Drury similarly condemns Jesus' moral teachings (e.g., Luke 6:29 --\\"...him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also\\"; Matthew 5:39 -- \\"I say unto you, That ye resist not evil...\\"). She argues that these place an impossibly high standard on human beings, with the result that Christians simply give up on moral behavior altogether and wallow in a state of guilt and sin.       It is, I think, clear enough that Christian teaching can engender moral hypocrisy. Nearly all Christians, if victimized by a thief, ignore Jesus' admonition to offer the thief their cloak also: Christians either resist such evil directly by themselves or call the police.       However, Drury goes beyond demonstrating the hypocrisy and unworkability of the Christian ethic.      She compares the Christian Church, unfavorably, to the great totalitarian movements of the last century: \\"The totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century were equally preoccupied with the control of thought. But in comparison to their more successful antecedent [i.e., the Church] they were mere amateurs.\\"       Really?       Moderate estimates of the innocent civilians murdered by Marxist governments during the twentieth century exceed one-hundred million souls (see Rummel's \\"Death by Government\\"). Does anyone believe that the death toll attributable to the Christian churches in the twentieth century, or indeed for the whole of the last two thousand years, comes anywhere close to that?       In focusing on religion rather than government as the cause of oppression, Drury's perspective seems out of focus. Ancient governments, long before the advent of Christianity, engaged in massive repression and tyranny -- including actual human sacrifice.       Before the Emperor Constantine absorbed Christianity into the structure of the state, Christians were not known for mass murder, systematic repression, etc. But, once the leaders of government became nominal Christians, Christianity was used to justify the murder, thievery, and oppression in which governments had always engaged.       And, as the post-Christian governments of the twentieth century proved, governments freed of the constraints of Christianity are more than capable of engaging in vicious militarism, imperialism, and mass murder of civilians.       The common thread here is not Christianity; it is government.       On her first page, Drury does refer to government as \\"the incarnation of force and fraud\\" but ignores her own point in the rest of the book.       In her final chapter, Drury makes clear that her animus against the Christian religion is partially motivated by the Bush Administration's use of Christianity to justify its policy of unbridled American imperialism.       I yield to no one in my opposition to the disastrous foreign policy of the Bush Administration.       (Full disclosure: I myself voted for Bush in 2000 because he promised a more restrained, \\"humble\\" foreign policy than that of the Clinton Administration. Bush, obviously, lied.)       But to believe that this horrific foreign policy is due to Christianity is absurd. The architects of the Bush foreign policy, the so-called \\"neoconservatives,\\" are largely non-religious secularists of Jewish origin. The Vatican, which represents the overwhelmingly largest body of Christians, strongly criticized the American war on Iraq: the war is clearly a violation of Catholic just-war doctrine.       Furthermore, America's liberal secularist Democratic Party largely supported the Iraq invasion (e.g., both John Kerry and Hillary Clinton voted for the enabling resolution).       Indeed, the famed leftist, anti-imperialist historian Gabriel Kolko, writing in early 2004 in \\"CounterPunch\\" magazine, offered an explanation as to \\"Why Kerry Might be Worse Than Bush.\\" In Kolko's view, the fundamentalist conservatives and the secularist liberals in the American political establishment share a common goal of unchallenged American world hegemony. But the right-wingers are so ham-fisted in their approach that they will probably fail. It is the more subtle imperialism of the American liberals, using the UN, NATO, etc. as clever fig leaves, that has a chance at actually conquering the world.      Drury is too willing to buy the propaganda that portrays the present conflict as a clash between Christendom and Islam. The issue is in fact bipartisan American imperialism versus indigenous populist nationalism.       In \\"Terror and Civilization,\\" Drury is, as always, readable, insightful, and provocative. Her willingness to directly confront the actual words of Jesus is admirable. But in blaming our own current missteps on Jesus of Nazareth, she over-reaches.       Christianity arose as a protest against an ancient society permeated by slavery, tyranny, brutality, militarism, and corruption.       To blame the militarism, imperialism, and corruption of our own society on Jesus of Nazareth misreads history.      The faults of our own society lie not in Jesus but in our own rapacious political elites, our own governments with their insatiable thirst for power, and, ultimately, in ourselves.	2004-07-21
US	50146788	R26AJPF7TMUMI9	0451147952	325358008	Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal	Books	4	28	44	N	N	A Utopian Ideal?	I first read &quot;Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal&quot; as a high-school sophomore in 1969, a couple years after its initial publication.  <br />Back in the '60s, it was controversial simply to argue that capitalism was more economically efficient than socialism; to claim, as Rand did, that capitalism was morally superior to socialism was revolutionary.  <br />Times have changed.  Nowadays it would require an invincible ignorance to believe that socialism can compete economically with capitalism.  And to believe that socialism is morally superior to capitalism, now that everyone knows the truth about actually existing socialism in the former Soviet Union, would be morally depraved.  <br />Intellectually, the battle is over.  Capitalism has won; socialism has lost.  Capitalism is no longer an &quot;unknown&quot; ideal.  <br />Our new historical situation makes it possible to look more clearly at Ayn Rand's political writings.  <br />Rand was unquestionably right about the moral and economic superiority of capitalism.  <br />But was she also right about the political, cultural, and historical conditions required to create and preserve a free, capitalistic social order?  <br />Rand consistently argued that the motive force of history was ideas.  Ultimately, it was intellectuals who control the course of human events.  <br />For example, in the second essay in this book, &quot;The Roots of War,&quot; Rand declares:<br />&quot;Just as the destruction of capitalism and the rise of the totalitarian state were not caused by business or labor or any economic interest, but by the dominant statist ideology of the intellectuals -- so the resurgence of the doctrines of military conquest and armed crusades for political 'ideals' were the product of the same intellectuals' belief that 'the good' is to be achieved by force.&quot;  <br />In the same essay, she explains that it was not economic interest but rather collectivist intellectuals who pushed America into involvement in bothWorld Wars.  (True to her principles, Rand opposed the military draft and the American involvement in Vietnam.)  <br />However, Rand and her followers, by focusing on the contribution collectivists have made to militarism have tended to neglect the other side of the coin, the contribution militarism, war, and imperialism have made to advancing the power of government.  <br />As Randolph Bourne said, &quot;War is the health of the state.&quot;   War provides an unparalleled opportunity for government to increase taxes, expand its control over the economy, suppress civil liberties, and pump up popular faith in the state.  <br />While intellectuals facilitated the destruction of Constitutional government in America during the twentieth century, the primary proximate cause of the growth of Big Government was the two World Wars and the Cold War.  <br />Rand failed to convey this lesson to her followers, most of whom have supported the current American imperial adventure in the Mideast.  <br />What then of Rand's basic analysis of the nature and purpose of government, laid out in two appendices, &quot;Man's Rights&quot; and &quot;The Nature of Government&quot;?  <br />Rand defines &quot;government&quot; as &quot;an institution that holds the exclusive power to _enforce_ certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area.&quot;  Note that government is defined abstractly as &quot;an institution,&quot; even though any actual government must consist of particular, concrete human beings.<br />A couple pages later, Rand declares, &quot;A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control.&quot;<br />Really?  <br />Given the historical record of war, militarism, imperialism, rape, pillaging, slavery, taxation, and mass murder in which governments have routinely engaged, is there any &quot;institution&quot; that is _less_ credible as a means of placing &quot;objective control&quot; over &quot;physical force&quot; than government?  <br />It would make as much sense to define the Mafia or street gangs as &quot;the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control&quot;!<br />Even the officials of a minimal government, endowed only with a monopoly over legislative, judicial, and peacekeeping functions, as Rand advocated, have already, by virtue of that very monopoly, been given powers not possessed by their fellow citizens.  <br />Rand argues for a written constitution &quot;as a means of limiting and restricting the power of government.&quot;  But of course, it is government officials who will interpret the provisions of the constitution, and they will have both the power and every incentive to use their power so as to evade any restrictions embodied in the constitution.  <br />This is not idle speculation.  Precisely this experiment was carried out in 1787 in Philadelphia.  Two hundred years later, we know the result -- a massively rapacious, militaristic, and imperialistic government which imperils the civil liberties of the American people, buries us in taxes, and claims the right to invade and dominate any other country anywhere in the world.  <br />If Madison, Franklin, Washington et al. could not make Rand's program work, it is fair to dismiss her program of limited constitutional government as a Utopian fantasy.  <br />A better definition than Rand's would be &quot;a government is a bunch of guys that have managed to get themselves in a position where they can get away with things (bombing, taxation, etc.) that most people could never get away with.&quot;  That accurately describes pretty much all governments in the real world (and subsumes Rand's definition of government as a privileged monopoly over legislative, judicial, and peacekeeping functions as a special case -- since most ordinary people could not get away with seizing such a monopoly).  <br />Of course, any society does need some minimal consensus on how to deal with and generally avoid violent conflict.  All human societies do in fact have various means for maintaining the peace, most of which have nothing to do with government.  Ask yourself: how many times have you peacefully settled a serious disagreement with a friend, relative, or neighbor without involving the government at all?  <br />It is not in the nature of government to be successfully limited.  Government has never existed to serve the governed.  If we want a free, prosperous, and peaceful society, government must go.  <br />For more realistic, less Utopian views on government, I recommend Murray Rothbard's &quot;The Ethics of Liberty,&quot; H. Hoppe's &quot;Democracy: The God That Failed,&quot; and A. John Simmons' &quot;On the Edge of Anarchy.&quot;	2004-07-04

In this brief but scintillating essay, Ernest Gellner describes the current intellectual situation faced by humankind, lays out his own allegiances, and offers his hopes for the future.<br />Gellner argues that there are three basic options of belief available today: he describes these as &quot;Religious fundamentalism,&quot; &quot;Relativism, as exemplified by the recent fashion of 'postmodernism',&quot; and &quot;Enlightenment rationalism or rationalist fundamentalism.&quot;<br />As an example of fundamentalism, Gellner focuses not on the long-maligned Christian fundamentalism of the West but rather on the Islamic fundamentalism which has recently captured the world's attention (Gellner's essay was published in 1992, nearly a decade before the 9/11 catastrophe).<br />Gellner credibly argues, contrary to the views propagated by Muslim-haters in the West, that in many ways Islamic fundamentalism is a modernizing and rationalizing force.  For example, he explains, &quot;Contrary to what outsiders generally suppose, the typical Muslim woman in a Muslim city doesn't wear the veil because her grandmother did so, but because her grandmother did _not_: her grandmother was far too busy in the fields, and she frequented the shrine without a veil, and left the veil to her betters.  The granddaughter is celebrating the fact that she has joined her grandmother's betters...&quot;<br />Gellner further argues that &quot;a certain kind of separation of powers was built into Muslim society from the very start...It subordinates the executive [i.e., the government] to the (divine) legislature and, in actual practice, turns the theologians/lawyers into the monitors of political rectitude...&quot;<br />This may seem an odd point to make given the contempt and derision which Western media have heaped on, for example, the &quot;mullahs&quot; of Iran.  And yet, for all its shortcomings, the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown more capacity for self-criticism, more actual democracy, than most secular regimes in the Islamic world (e.g., Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime in Iraq).  And the atrocities committed by the mullahs are almost insignificant compared to the tens of millions of innocent persons murdered by the anti-religious socialist regimes which dominated Asia during the twentieth century (in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Communist Cambodia, etc.).<br />While Gellner is not an uncritical admirer of fundamentalism, Islamic or otherwise, he turns his main guns on his fellow academics, especially those who espouse &quot;postmodernism&quot; and other allied forms of relativism.<br />Gellner explains that the universities are dominated by the research model provided by the natural sciences in which scholars are expected to constantly churn out genuinely new knowledge.  But, he adds, &quot;in fields such as the humanities, not only is it not clear that there is any cumulative development, any real 'progress', it is not always altogether clear what 'research' should or could aim it.&quot;  So, in lieu of true scholarship, the humanities are seduced into &quot;a setting up of artificial obsolescence and rotation of fashion, characteristic of the consumer goods industry...&quot;  Postmodernism, and its predecessors and successors, are academic fads.<br />Gellner demonstrates this in great detail in a case study of his own profession of anthropology.<br />He further argues that postmodernism and other forms of intellectual relativism are not merely harmless academic fads; they also distract us from understanding the most important historical development of the last thousand years.<br />That development, Gellner maintains, consists of the fact that, for the first time in human history, one civilization has discovered a method to reveal objective, practically indisputable, and culturally-independent knowledge about the natural world, knowledge that offers incomparable power in controlling nature and doing good or harm to our fellow humans.<br />That method is generally called the &quot;scientific method&quot; and every civilization on this planet is frantic to reap its fruits.<br />&quot;Enlightenment Rationalist Fundamentalism&quot; is the label Gellner uses for the belief system which underlies the natural sciences and which neither swears allegiance to any religious or ideological Revelation nor succumbs to the superficial tolerance of all-ideas-are-equal relativism as is preached by postmodernism.<br />Enlightenment rationalism preaches initial tolerance for any idea or hypothesis but only on condition that this hypothesis be subjected to the ruthlessly severe test of the scientific method.  Of course, very few ideas survive the test.<br />In some ultimate sense, Enlightenment rationalism is the least tolerant belief system of all.<br />Coyly, Gellner offers as a model for the future an uneasy but mutually tolerant coexistence among these three competing belief systems.  Yet, in his final two pages he makes clear whom he envisions as ultimately triumphing from such a system of mutual coexistence.<br />He scathingly dismisses postmodernists as historically irrelevant: &quot;The relativists, in whatever guise -- the 'postmodernists' are but an extravagant, undisciplined and transient mode of this attitude -- seem to me to offer an accurate and acceptable account of how we do, and probably of how we should, order our gastronomy (at any rate on any one evening), our wallpaper, and even, for lack of a better alternative, our daily self-image.  (Though most evenings, I'd prefer a traditional rather than postmodernist menu.)  Their insights apply to the decorative rather than to the real structural and functional aspects of our life...As an account of the realities of our world and a guide to conduct, [their] position is laughable.&quot;<br />He also dismisses serious religious belief as, perhaps, once having served a historically necessary purpose but now supplanted by the true knowledge offered by science: &quot;The fundamentalists deserve our respect, both as fellow recognizers of the uniqueness of truth, who avoid the facile self-deception of universal relativism, and as our intellectual ancestors.  Without indulging in excessive ancestor-worship, we do owe them a measure of reverence.  Without serious, not to say obsessional monotheism and unitarianism, the rationalist naturalism of the Enlightenment might well never have seen the light of day...It was a jealous Jehovah who really taught mankind the Law of the Excluded Middle.&quot;<br />In the end, the only belief system which can survive long-term is, Gellner believes, the empiricist rationalism created in the Western-European Enlightenment.<br />To put it bluntly, the future belongs to John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Thomas Jefferson.<br />I think, and hope, that Gellner is right.hod is generally called the &quot;scientific method&quot; and every civilization on this planet is frantic to reap its fruits.<br />&quot;Enlightenment Rationalist Fundamentalism&quot; is the label Gellner uses for the belief system which underlies the natural sciences and which neither swears allegiance to any religious or ideological Revelation nor succumbs to the superficial tolerance of all-ideas-are-equal relativism as is preached by postmodernism.<br />Enlightenment rationalism preaches initial tolerance for any idea or hypothesis but only on condition that this hypothesis be subjected to the ruthlessly severe test of the scientific method.

US	50146788	R2J1ZRC10LLT8L	0226777014	504264185	The City and Man	Books	4	110	158	N	N	Strauss vs. the "Straussians"?	\\"The City and Man\\" consists of three lectures by the famed -- and controversial -- political theorist Leo Strauss: he offers commentaries on Aristotle's \\"Politics,\\" on Plato's \\"Republic,\\" and on Thucydides' \\"History of the Peloponnesian War.\\"  <br />Strauss, who was during his life an obscure professor at the University of Chicago, has recently achieved posthumous fame because a number of his alleged disciples, so-called \\"Straussians,\\" were among the neoconservatives who conceived and implemented the recent disastrous American conquest of Iraq.  <br />His writings have therefore acquired new interest because of the insight they may provide into the thinking of those who have attempted to create a new American imperium.  <br />Strauss is renowned for his verbosity, for a bizarre numerological fixation on the ancient texts he studied, and for a belief in \\"esotericism\\"  -- i.e., that the classic authors hid their real teachings in cryptic subtexts discernible only by the most probing of readers.  <br />\\"The City and Man\\" definitely exhibits Strauss' verbosity -- it is appropriate bedtime reading only if one needs a cure for insomnia.  There is, however, little evidence of Strauss' numerological fetish -- he does at one point allude to a certain numerical symmetry in the structure of Plato's \\"Republic\\" based on a two-one-two pattern in the number of Socrates' \\"interlocutors,\\" but the point is of the sort that any literary critic might make.  <br />And to the degree that Strauss attributes \\"esoteric\\" doctrines to his authors in this book, it is again such as any literary critic might suggest -- e.g., he repeatedly suggests that certain characters are intended to illustrate certain ideal types or that the presentation is structured so as to emphasize certain key themes.  <br />The primary conclusion reached in Strauss's first and briefest essay, on Aristotle's \\"Politics,\\" is uncontroversial:  the \\"guiding question of Aristotle's 'Politics' is the question of the best regime.\\"  Aristotle was a \\"partisan of excellence.\\"  However, Strauss further adds, a \\"difficulty arises from the fact that the highest end of the individual is contemplation.\\"  Because the mass of men, unlike Aristotle, are incapable of a fully contemplative life, Strauss claims \\"that there are examples of men of the highest excellence whereas there are no examples of cities of the highest excellence...\\"  This introduces a theme, which occurs throughout Strauss' work, of the conflict between a life devoted to the pursuit of wisdom and the demands of civil and political life.  <br />Strauss sharpens this point in his longer essay on Plato's \\"Republic.\\"  After explaining in detail Plato's ideal of the philosopher-king, Strauss reveals that the deepest impracticality in Plato's scheme is \\"the philosophers' unwillingness to rule...Why are the philosophers unwilling to rule?  Being dominated by the desire...for knowledge as the one thing needful...the philosophers have no desire for looking down at human affairs, let alone for taking care of them.\\"  <br />It is Strauss' longest and final essay, on Thucydides' history of the brutal war which ended the classical period in Greece, which speaks most directly to our own current condition.  Strauss declares that in wartime \\"manners become altogether depraved...The decay in speech and in deed of moderation is accompanied by the decay of respect for law...a good regime...is averse to war and will avoid every war which can be avoided.\\"<br />Unfortunately, Strauss argues, democracy leads to imperialism and war: \\"empire...is not possible without the full participation of the demos [i.e., the democratic mass electorate, what is now called \\"the people\\"] in political life; the demos is enthusiastically in favor of the grandest imperial enterprise...\\"<br />In the end Strauss condemns \\"Athenian imperialism,\\" the ultimate cause of the horrifying war, not for its narrow and self-seeking side (which he shows did exist) but rather for its \\"fantastic political universalism.\\"  The Athenians were gripped by a naive utopian belief that culture, enlightenment, and democracy could be exported via military might.  <br />Strauss argues that, rather than \\"sham universalism\\" based on military conquest, the only proper form of universalism is \\"the universalism of thought,\\" the peaceful and non-violent spread of enlightenment through cultural interaction.  <br />In light of Strauss' own arguments, what are we to make of the neoconservative \\"Straussians\\" who have brought about the American military conquest of Iraq in order to \\"liberate\\" the Iraqi people?  <br />Far from being wise men who wished to avoid the demands of political power, they have struggled and schemed to gain power.  They have certainly not, in Strauss' words, avoided \\"every war which can be avoided\\"; indeed, they fabricated false stories of \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" in order to engineer a preemptive attack.  As Strauss predicted, \\"The decay in speech and in deed of moderation is accompanied by the decay of respect for law...\\"  The decay of respect for law has resulted in grotesque violations of the American Constitution -- the arbitrary denial of habeas corpus, the USA Patriot Act, etc.  And there is no secret that all of this is motivated by, as Strauss says, a \\"fantastic political universalism,\\" the belief that America can and should impose, by force of arms, its own system of \\"democratic capitalism\\" not only on the Iraqi people but on the entire world, whether the rest of the world wants it or not.  <br />In short, the neoconservative \\"Straussians\\" are the people Strauss warned us about in \\"The City and Man.\\"  They are \\"Straussians\\" in name only.  In fact, they are the cruel idealists, the humanitarians with a guillotine, who destroy civilization in the name of advancing it.  We saw their kind in ancient Athens, in revolutionary France, in Bolshevik Russia, in Maoist China, and, now, in contemporary America.  <br />As Leo Strauss so ably demonstrates in \\"The City and Man,\\" they are not conservatives; they are nihilists.  <br />Because of Strauss' Teutonic style, his pedantic focus on detail, and his sheer verbosity, \\"The City and Man\\" is not easy reading.  But, in \\"The City and Man,\\" Strauss does offer us a timely warning of the horrifying abyss towards which we ourselves are now hurtling.	2004-02-24
US	50146788	R2Z5WREDHO7ICB	0521293820	503443822	007: The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes: Volume 7, The General Theory	Books	2	69	138	N	N	The savior of "capitalism" or corporatist liberalism?	I read Keynes' \\"General Theory\\" as a high-school sophomore in 1970.  Even as a high-school student, I was able to see the central analytical error.  <br />The key Keynesian argument is that there can be an imbalance between savings and investment: savers may try to save more than they invest, in effect taking money out of circulation and thereby throwing the economy into depression.  <br />Of course, they have to do something with this money, presumably holding it as cash in some form.  Therefore, if you follow through the analysis to the end, Keynes is saying that people are trying to hold more cash than is available: the demand of savers to hold savings in cash rather than as investments is what causes depressions.  <br />Keynes and his followers accept this conclusion: the term which came to be used was that there was a \\"liquidity trap,\\" the desire to hold more cash (\\"liquidity\\") than was actually supplied in the economy is what produces depressions.  <br />However, as soon as the matter is phrased in terms of an imbalance between the supply and demand of money, anyone who passed economics 101 should remember that market economies are _very_ good at equilibrating supply and demand.  If the current demand for a good is too high, then the current market value is too low, and a rise in the market value of that commodity will solve the problem.  <br />It works for money, too.  A rise in the value of money is called \\"price deflation,\\" and economists have known for centuries that price deflation does indeed naturally occur in depressions. As the general price level falls, the existing supply of money becomes more valuable -- in effect, the real supply of money becomes greater.  It becomes more tempting to spend one's cash on now cheaper goods or investments.  Price deflation, if allowed to occur by governments, cures liquidity traps.  <br />I figured this out for myself as a high-school student (there is an alternative but equivalent analysis based on \\"dimensional analysis\\" which, as a budding physicist, I found especially cogent).  <br />I was not of course the first to work this out: even _before_ Keynes published the \\"General Theory,\\" the British economist A. C. Pigou had worked through this analysis and the matter is often therefore referred to as the \\"Pigou effect.\\"  Since Pigou, various eminent economists have worked out the mechanism in great detail with careful mathematical analyses, but the basic idea is freshman economics.  When I entered college, I found out that the advanced graduate-level \\"macro\\" books did indeed let the secret out that Keynes' analysis was wrong.  It was only undergrads, politicians, and the general public that were expected to believe the Keynesian fallacy.  <br />So why the decades of lying?  <br />Just as the Communist governments of the old Soviet empire needed Karl Marx's goofy economics theories and laughable philosophical scribblings in order to prop up their own corrupt regimes, so also the rising mid-twentieth-century predatory military-university-government-industrial complex in Western nations needed an ideology to justify the corporatist-socialist regimes it was creating.  <br />Keynes' prescriptions for monetary inflation, deficit spending, rejection of the gold standard, and high levels of government spending and taxation were tailor-made for the democratic-socialist welfare/warfare states then being erected in various Western nations.  <br />As corporate liberals are so fond of saying, Keynes did indeed \\"save capitalism\\" if by \\"capitalism\\" one means not free-market capitalism but rather the corrupt crony capitalism under which we now all live.  <br />Keynes himself knew this of course.  The infamous statement he made in the introduction to the German translation of the \\"General Theory\\" (\\"theory of aggregate production, which is the point of the following book, nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez-faire\\") obviously does not prove that Keynes was sympathetic to Nazism.  But it does show that Keynes rightly recognized that his proposals were of great potential value for the oppressive political regimes that were being created during the twentieth century.  <br />Even though Keynesian theories are now intellectually discredited \\"flat-earth\\" economics, they live on because they serve a political need.  Even conservative politicians nowadays often spout Keynesian nostrums (\\"stimulating demand\\" via tax cuts or monetary growth) rather than make the painful acknowledgement that it is the corporate-socialist economic system under which we live which is the problem.  <br />No regime lasts forever.  Eventually, the present corporatist-collectivist regime will collapse, probably when the majority of the human race figures out how to free itself from the current American geopolitical hegemony.  At that point, Keynes will be universally viewed as the economically incompetent charlatan that he actually was.  <br />(For a more detailed analysis of the Keynesian system, I recommend Henry Hazlitt's classic \\"Failure of the New Economics\\" and the collection of critical essays Hazlitt edited, \\"Critics of Keynesian Economics.\\"  For an analysis that goes beyond Keynes in analyzing the process which causes the initial imbalance in the investment sector and the resulting liquidity crisis, see Murray Rothbard's \\"America's Great Depression.\\"  Keynes purported to believe that the triggering forces of the investment crisis were irrational and inexplicable \\"animal spirits.\\"  Rothbard shows that, on the contrary, these forces can be rationally explained and understood: in essence, it is incompetent financial policy, of the sort Alan Greenspan has provided in the last decade, which causes economic crises.  Milton Friedman's and Anna Schwartz's famed \\"The Great Contraction\\" focuses solely onthe monetary aspects of the Great Depression, thereby missing the causative process in the investment sector.)	2004-02-04
US	50146788	R3EMIYCTIIYXBF	0451163087	465394256	For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand (50th Anniversary Edition) (Signet)	Books	4	21	41	N	N	Where did Rand go wrong?	This book consists of an introductory essay, followed by several philosophical essays originally published as integral parts of Ayn Rand's various novels.  <br />Ayn Rand's core philosophy was ultimately motivated by hero-worship, an emotional need to idolize men (and it was always men!) of grand gestures and great achievements.  Although the protagonists of her novels (Dominique Francon in \\"The Fountainhead,\\" Dagny Taggart in \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" and Kira Argounova in \\"We the Living\\") were generally women, the heroes of the books were always men (Howard Roark, John Galt, and Leo Kovalensky/Andrei Taganov).  <br />Rand's life-long goal was to create in the real world a new sort of man, a man unlike those she saw all around her, a man she could honestly admire and worship.  Hence the title of this book -- ii is written for her hoped-for \\"new intellectual.\\"  <br />She failed.  <br />Anyone who has run into \\"Randian cultists,\\" whether in real life or on the Internet, will realize why the phrase \\"Randian cultists\\" is apropos: I have yet to meet a single one who is a model of rationality and achievement.  Is it a coincidence that the best-known Randian in the real world is Alan Greenspan, the evasive, self-serving, simpering bureaucrat who brought us the \\"dot com\\" debacle and who yet manages to survive under Democratic and Republican Presidents alike?  <br />What went wrong?  <br />Part of the answer, I think, is that Rand and her followers suffer from an enormous emotional and social insecurity, a huge lack of self-esteem.  <br />For example, in the final essay in \\"For the New Intellectual,\\" Rand furiously condemns government scientists who \\"scorn the use of their science for the purpose and profit of life, they deliver their science to the service of death, to the only practical purpose it can have for looters: to inventing weapons of coercion and destruction.\\"  <br />This deserves applause as a brilliant and scathing condemnation of the military-industrial complex.  But,in real life, I have never seen Rand or any of her core followers condemn the actual American military-industrial complex, the actual government scientists who created the atomic bomb in \\"the service of death,\\" or the actual American drive for world hegemony.  <br />Rand's and her insecure followers' eagerness to identify with and feel part of the ruling regime prevents them from actually materially and openly challenging that regime.  <br />Another part of the problem is that Rand, with a novelist's attention to symbolism, allowed symbolism to overpower reality.  Although she denounced taxation in any form and defended laissez-faire capitalism, she eulogized the government-created, tax-financed American manned space program.  You see, symbolically, the manned space program was a great symbol of human rationality and achievement, even though, in reality, it was scientifically pointless political propaganda which actually retarded the development of an economically viable free-market space industry.  (As to the symbolism, Tom Wolfe's phrase from \\"The Right Stuff,\\" 'spam-in-a-can,' is actually a scientifically apt description of the early American astronauts!)  <br />But perhaps Rand's greatest error, which her followers propagate, is her claim, stated clearly in \\"For the New Intellectual,\\" that \\"there is no such thing as 'non-practical knowledge' or any sort of 'disinterested' action...\\"  Aside from the fact that this is obviously false, it has disastrous consequences.  When one judges ideas only by their uses and consequences, one loses sight of the ideal of disinterested truth.  This is the grand totalitarian temptation, to which the twentieth-century succumbed.  Whether in the form of Marxism, social-democratic pragmatism, or Rand's own \\"Objectivism,\\" it means the death of the mind and of the spirit of man.  <br />This error is, I think, integral to her system.  Aristotle began the \\"Metaphysics\\" by stating that \\"all men by nature desire to know.\\"  While Aristotlecertainly did not despise putting knowledge to practical use, he viewed knowledge for its own sake as an end, indeed the highest end, in and of itself.  <br />But, the solitary disinterested seeker after truth cannot satisfy Rand's need for hero-worship.  A Randian hero must build, control, and dominate the natural and social world.  To merely seek enjoyment, beauty, and understanding of the world, to quietly live one's own life with one's friends and family, is not to be fully human in the Randian perspective.  <br />Such a perspective is inhuman.  As Murray Rothbard once remarked, there are no children in Ayn Rand's imaginary worlds: a Randian world would survive only one generation, after which the human race would be extinct!<br />When I first read \\"For a New Intellectual\\" as an adolescent, I found it exciting and intellectually stimulating.  It raises a host of questions which need answering.  Much of Rand's assault on the prevailing culture -- both popular culture and high-brow culture -- is on-target.  <br />I heartily recommend reading this book.  But it must be read critically and with caution.  Rand captures an important side of human life -- her emphasis on reason as the key tool of man's existence is absolutely correct (and, of course, goes back to Aristotle's definition of man as the \\"rational animal\\").  She is right that the twentieth century was a vast intellectual wasteland, and that we do indeed need \\"new intellectuals.\\"  <br />But those new intellectuals need more than the writings of Chairman Ayn.  They need to refamiliarize themselves with the whole heritage of civilization which the twentieth century so cavalierly swept aside -- the existentialism of Aquinas, the humanity of Aristotle, the decency of Catholic just-war teachings, the anarchism of Henry Thoreau, etc.  <br />Uncompromising rationalism, untrammeled free markets, individual liberty, strictly limited government, on all of this Rand was right.  But she was wrong to worship achievement, to allow symbolism to trump reality, and to accept in practice a ruling regime that she condemned in principle.  She was wrong to believe that humans should live solely to work and to dominate.  She was wrong to ignore the human need for loving families or the disinterested human interest in knowledge.  <br />This book is, at best, a launching pad for the \\"new intellectuals.\\"  They must soar far beyond it if they are to succeed.	2004-01-31
US	50146788	RJNQVQKVBMVHT	0060516054	433958284	What Went Wrong?: The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East	Books	2	20	39	N	N	A respected scholar in decline	It is sad when a respected scholar continues to publish when his faculties are no longer at their keenest.  But it can also be, unintentionally, funny.<br />Such is the case with Bernard Lewis\\" \\"What Went Wrong.\\"  <br />The most hilarious part of the book is Lewis' peculiar obsession towards the end of his volume with the idea that the failure of the Islamic world to adopt Western classical music is the key to the Islamic world's problems.  I'm as fond of Beethoven and Bach as Lewis is, but the idea that the key to the problems of the Islamic world is the failure to listen to the glorious Ninth or to \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,\\" is, shall we say, eccentric.  Lewis does note drolly, \\"Latterly [in the Islamic world] there has been some interest in pop music and rock music.  It is too early to say what this may portend.\\"  <br />Sadly, this musical theory of history is the closest Lewis comes to explaining \\"what went wrong.\\"  His knowledge of Arab history (particularly of the Ottoman Empire, which is really what the book focuses on) is encyclopedic and the book is filled with fascinating details and intriguing anecdotes.  But there is no integration of these details into any sort of coherent explanation for \\"What Went Wrong\\" in the Islamic Mideast during the last several centuries.  <br />And yet such an explanation is possible.  As Robert Wesson noted in \\"The Imperial Order,\\" empires tend to be culturally, technologically, and economically unproductive.  The great cultural florescence of the Islamic Middle East occurred during the ninth through twelfth centuries, after the decline of the Abbassid empire and before the rise of the Ottoman empire.  As Fernand Braudel noted, in his \\"A History of Civilizations,\\" \\"the decline of the Baghdad caliphate...made possible a degree of intellectual freedom, if only by enabling a scholar to flee from one State or one princely protector to another nearby.\\"  <br />When most of the Islamic Middle East was once again subjugated to centralized imperial rule by the Ottoman empire, it was predictable that the end result would be Islamic social and cultural decay.  Empires breed decadence.   <br />The other key point which Lewis ignores is that the Islamic world has, throughout most of its history, generally been much more democratic than the elitist, hierarchical West.  There has never been a Pope in Islam; the ultimate determinant of Islamic belief and practice has always been the consensus of the Islamic community, the \\"umma.\\"  <br />A broad popular consensus is almost invariably conservative or actively reactionary.  How would Copernicus' theory that the earth moved around the sun or Darwin's theory of evolution have fared if subjected to the judgment of the general populace?  As it happens, something much like this actually did happen in the Islamic world: in the late Middle Ages, a consensus developed among the Islamic faithful that Greek science and philosophy were un-Islamic and needed to be purged from the Islamic community. <br />As Toby Huff explained in his classic \\"The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West,\\" \\"The possibility of opposition from the local 'ulama' [popular religious scholars] was thus a constant threat and stemmed from the fact that the religious scholars -- who orchestrated their own political constituency -- and the local populace held views sharply different on a variety of theological, metaphysical, and scientific issues from the philosophers.\\"  The democratic, anti-elitist cast of Islam, Huff later adds, meant that \\"[i]n this system, each person's interpretation was as good as everyone else's...\\"  A scientific elite holding views different from the popular majority was unacceptable in Islam.  <br />In the West, the populace was of course also often hostile to scientific and intellectual advances, but the Western scientific and intellectual elites did not much care: submission to the popular will was not as important historically in the West as in Islam.  <br />Why did not Lewis note the well-established fact that the decline of the Islamic Middle East was due to empire and to a destructive form of democratic populism?  Could it be that the current American obsession with exporting American-style democracy to the Mideast and establishing an American-controlled empire in the region made it inexpedient for Lewis to note that the path of democracy and empire led to the decline and decadence of one of the greatest of human civilizations?  <br />Democracy and imperialism destroyed the Roman Republic and brought catastrophe to classical Athens.  During the twentieth century, the Europeans experimented with various systems for turning \\"the people\\" into God: the one common thread among Bolshevism, Nazism, and social democracy was the deification of the masses -- the Volk, the proletariat, the people.  Combined with the forces of European imperialism, this nearly resulted in the destruction of European civilization via two horrifying World Wars and multiple Holocausts (see, e.g., Hannah Arendt's \\"The Origins of Totalitarianism\\").  <br />Now the United States of America is marching forward along the well-worn path of democracy and imperialism.  <br />Was Lewis reluctant to allow Americans to see in the historical tragedy of the Islamic Mideast our own future if we continue along the path upon which we are now treading?	2004-01-29

It was obvious to me then that \\"Fabian Freeway\\" is indeed highly opinionated: the author makes no attempt to hide the fact that her own ideological views differ from those of the people she is studying.  For obvious reasons, I wondered if her ideological views had led to biases and misrepresentations in the book.<br />During subsequent decades, as I have run across information from other sources with other ideological axes to grind, I have come to respect Martin's accuracy and honesty.  I have yet to find any serious example of dishonesty or misrepresentation on her part (which is not to say that I share all of her views or agree with all of her interpretations).  On the contrary, I've found her book to be a good introduction to much of the intellectual history of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br />For example, Martin's book was my first introduction to the \\"Nationalist\\" movement which swept late nineteenth-century America as a result of Edward Bellamy's utopian nationalist-socialist novel, \\"Looking Backward.\\"  (I later found out that the Pledge of Allegiance, now, ironically, a right-wing political shibboleth, was written by Bellamy's cousin, who was also an outspoken socialist!)<br />It was through Martin that I learned of the militarist-totalitarian novel \\"Philip Dru, Administrator\\" written by Woodrow Wilson's close confidant, Edward House.  It was Martin who introduced me to the famous \\"Bloomsbury group\\" of British intellectuals -- Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, J. M. Keynes, etc. (for an interesting recent expose of the Bloomsbury group by a self-proclaimed liberal/modernist intellectual, see Hilton Kramer's \\"Twilight of the Intellectuals\\").<br />And, of course, Martin provided a fascinating introduction to the colorful early figures of the British Fabain Society, George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb, etc.<br />What I learned from Martin served me well in broadening my knowledge of intellectual history.<br />In short, the book is far broader than the title (or Marc Stears' denunciation) indicates.<br />Furthermore, Martin's political analysis is also more subtle and nuanced than Stears' denunciation implies.<br />There is inevitably a connection between socialism and Communism: Communists, after all, claim to be socialists.  Furthermore, Martin offers details involving occasional socialist-Communist cooperation: for example, the leading Fabian socialists Sidney and Beatrice Webb, during the Stalinist terror, authored a laudatory book about Stalinism entitled \\"Soviet Communism -- A New Civilization.\\" I. M. Bogolepov, a Soviet defector, later testified before a U. S. Senate subcommittee that he, at the time a Soviet official, had actually ghostwritten most of the book.<br />Yet Martin also states, \\"The same puzzling ambivalence -- a combination of love and occasional hatred...marked the attitude of Fabian Socialists towards Moscow throughout the nineteen-twenties and thirties and exists today.\\"  Similarly, while she is harshly critical of some of JFK's intellectual advisors, she acknowledges the well-known ties between JFK and Joe McCarthy.<br />If nothing else, one gets the impression from Martin that many Anglo-American left-wing intellectuals looked down their noses at the Soviets for purely class and cultural reasons: for many of them, Stalinism was not so much evil as unappetizing.<br />In short, what Martin paints is not a picture of a monolithic conspiracy, whether controlled by Moscow or anyone else, but rather a widespread political movement, lacking in central control but with a broad agreement on general principles and the general direction in which to move.<br />That's not \\"McCarthyite;\\" it's simply honest intellectual history.<br />Perhaps Martin's greatest sin is a willingness to accept intellectuals' self-evaluation of their own importance.  Intellectuals do not directly make history; FDR and, earlier, Abe Lincoln did far more to expand American government and thereby move it in a \\"socialist\\" direction, than any intellectuals could have done.  More broadly, it is the grand dynamics of history -- the inherent logic of democratic government, the horrendous wars of the twentieth century, etc. -- which have fueled the drive for \\"Big Government.\\"<br />And, yet, if intellectuals do not directly drive history, they do establish a climate of thought which influences how the men of action respond to historical events.  In the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, Europe moved towards a system of limited government, rule of law, and laissez faire.  The West moved in precisely the opposite direction after the first World War.  The climate of ideas, as formulated by intellectuals, does matter.<br />\\"Fabian Freeway\\" is important, serious, and gracefully written, with occasional flashes of humor.  (I still chuckle over \\"Philip Littell [who] named his canary Onan, because it scattered its seed\\" -- you need to recall the OldTestament reference to get the joke.)  It is not necessary to share Martin's ideological perspective to get a lot out of this fascinating book.<br />For views from alternative ideological perspectives, I recommend \\"The Twilight of the Intellectuals: Culture and Politics in the Era of the Cold War\\" by Hilton Kramer and Justin Raimondo's \\"Reclaiming the American Right.\\"	2004-01-16

This book is an attack by an \\"insider\\" on the contemporary disciplines of cognitive science and evolutionary psychology.  <br />Fodor does not deny that there are some valid aspects to these two disciplines.  Rather, he rejects their extravagant claims to have successfully explained \\"The Way the Mind Works,\\" to quote the title of a recent book by Steve Pinker, who is one of the leading evangelists for cognitive psychology and evolutionary psych.  <br />Fodor's central complaint against evolutionary psychology is quite simple.  Anyone who claims to offer an evolutionary explanation for the wings of birds can start with a great deal of solid knowledge about how bird's wings are in fact constructed, about how wings make flight possible given the laws of aerodynamics, etc.  <br />But no one in fact yet possesses the equivalent information for the brain and the mind.<br />We do not yet know how the neurons are connected and in what manner they function so as to produce thought.  More basically, we do not understand what \\"mind\\" really is from the viewpoint of the underlying physics of the brain (see, e.g., David Chalmers' \\"The Conscious Mind\\" or Colin McGinn's \\"The Mysterious Flame\\").<br />Fodor also has more specific objections.  He is highly concerned with the issue of \\"abduction,\\" the ability to make global judgments of simplicity, relevance, etc. over a broad intellectual domain.  Fodor believes that humans are very good at this, but that the current \\"modular\\" approach pursued by cognitive scientists and evolutionary psychologists cannot explain how humans could be good at this.  <br />I'm not sure human judgment is as powerful as Fodor believes, but he is correct that modular systems have difficulty making broad global judgments.  <br />In his final chapter, Fodor directly addresses the issue of evolution, arguing that, for a feature to be the product of natural selection, it must be built up by a small number of steps.  Using the example of the giraffe's neck, he argues, \\"Make the giraffe's neck just a little longer and you correspondingly increase, by just a little, the animal's ability to reach the fruit at the top of the tree; so it's plausible, to that extent, that selction stretched giraffe's necks bit by bit.\\"  <br />This example is somewhat misleading: there is no reason in principle why a single mutation could not have created huge giraffe necks in one fell swoop and natural selection then stepped in to preserve the mutation.  <br />But Fodor is correct that such a \\"saltationist\\" explanation is not available to evolutionary psychology.  The plethora of specialized mental modules favored by evolutionary psychologists (a language module, a \\"cheater detection module,\\" a face-recognition module, a theory-of-mind module, to name only a few) are supposed to be carefully honed adaptations exquisitely polished by natural selection to serve human needs in the \\"ancestral environment\\" (the Paleolithic).  Just as a complex organ such as the eye could not realistically be created in one single fortuitous mutation, so neither could these complex mental \\"organs\\" hypothesized by evolutionary psych.  <br />But why does Fodor reject a gradual, multifaceted evolution of these hypothetical mental \\"organs\\"?  He does not say, but there is a fairly powerful argument from the human genome project.  We only have about 30,000 genes; most of these are shared with lower mammals and many with non-vertebrates and even non-animals.  There just are not that many genes left which distinguish us from mice.  <br />A change in a relatively small number of regulatory genes can bring dramatic changes in development -- our much larger brain, for example.  But to actually create a number of new specialized \\"organs,\\" not possessed by mice or cows places much greater demands on the genome.  It's doubtful we have enough genes to handle it.  <br />The evolutionary psych response, as made in Pinker's \\"The Blank Slate,\\" to this argument is in essence that since these mental modules _do_ exist, our genes _must_ be able to produce the modules.  That of course assumes what is to be proven, i.e., that the human mind is based on evolutionarily-derived specialized mental modules.  <br />Fodor completely demolishes the claim that the unity of science demands that evolutionary psychology be true.  The degree to which the science of evolution is relevant to the science of psychology is, he rightly argues, an empirical matter, just as (to use his example) it is an empirical matter whether \\"the theory of lunar geography constrains the theory of cellular mitosis.\\"  Not every science has to be relevant to every other science.  <br />Fodor also shreds what he calls \\"neo-Darwinist anti-intellectualism,\\" the view (he is quoting from Patricia Churchland) that \\"looked at from an evolutionary point of view, the principal function of nervous systems is to get the body parts where they should be in order that the organism may survive...Truth, whatever that is, definitely takes the hindmost.\\"  <br />Fodor counters that for humans \\"a cognitive system that is specialized for the fixation of true beliefs interacts with a conative system that is specialized to figure out how to get what one wants from the world that the beliefs are true of...\\"  or, in simple English, humans engage in \\"rational actions predicated on true beliefs.\\"  <br />We are designed to pursue both truth and our own well-being -- there is no contradiction here.  Not action instead of truth, but action based on truth.    <br />Despite the brief length and Fodor's engaging style, this book is not easy reading.  But it does raise questions which, if not adequately answered by Fodor's opponents, cast grave doubts on the grandiose claims of contemporary apostles of cognitive science and evolutionary psychology.	2004-01-14

Colin McGinn's central claim in this brilliant and fascinating book is that the &quot;question of the relationship of mind and body is perfectly genuine, but our minds are not equipped to solve it, rather as the cat's mind is not up to discovering relativity theory...&quot;  On that central claim, McGinn fails to make his case.  <br />The fundamental problem is that McGinn's concept of an adequate solution is simply too demanding: &quot;The solution would also, I think, have to take the form of a statement of what consciousness is, and that statement would have to be conceptually necessary...It would have to be as obvious that consciousness could arise from the brain as it is obvious that bachelors are unmarried males.&quot;  <br />That is too high a demand to place on scientific theories: even our best theories in physics (relativity, quantum field theory, etc.) come nowhere near reaching such an elevated bar.  <br />And yet, in explaining lucidly and in detail why it is so hard to come up with any sort of reasonable speculation as to how the mind and brain are related, McGinn does shed a great deal of light on the basic issue.  <br />McGinn explains the fundamental problem: &quot;Suppose I know everything about your brain of a neural kind: I know its anatomy, its chemical ingredients, the pattern of electrical activity in its various segments.  I even know the position of every atom and its subatomic structure.  I know everything that the materialist says your mind is.  Do I thereby know everything about your mind?  It certainly seems not.  On the contrary I know nothing about your mind.  I know nothing about which conscious states you are in -- whether you are morose or manic, for example -- and what these states feel like to you.  So knowledge of your brain does not give me knowledge of your mind.&quot;  <br />As a Ph.D. in theoretical physics myself, I will attest that McGinn is absolutely right.  It is not just that physics has not yet succeeded in elucidatingthe nature of consciousness; rather, it is that, in constructing all of our theories in physics to date, we physicists have intentionally chosen to eschew any whiff of the &quot;interior&quot; perspective provided by consciousness and have only allowed the exterior perspective of materialism to enter into the structure of our theories.  We've done this for very good reasons, of course -- it has worked wonderfully in explaining the physical world, and we've figured that the issue of consciousness and its interior perspective is someone else's problem.  <br />McGinn argues that to understand consciousness this perspective of physics simply must be widened (and he doubts we humans have the mental power to do the widening): in his words, &quot;My thesis is that consciousness depends upon an unknowable natural property of the brain...It follows that physics, construed as the general science of matter, is incomplete, because the general properties of matter that the brain exploits to produce consciousness are currently unknown.&quot;  He even speculates that there is some humanly unfathomable dimensional structure to space-time and matter that leads to consciousness.  <br />Maybe.  <br />But I think McGinn underestimates how well we physicists understand the structure of molecules, atoms, and the electrons, protons, and neutrons of which they are comprised.  We know how these things work to an almost unbelievable level of accuracy in a wide variety of situations.  Physically, the brain is just a straightforward aqueous solution, no more complex at the level of elementary particles than a can of chicken soup.  <br />It's hard to believe there is important missing physics there.  <br />Indeed, we physicists have for several decades actually been following McGinn's advice to explore extra trans-dimensional space-time structures of all sorts (e.g., the currently popular ten and eleven-dimensional superstring and super-p-brane theories).  We still see no hint of the &quot;interior&quot; perspective provided by consciousness.  <br />McGinn is right that physics does not explain consciousness; there is no sign that his own ideas or any other ideas can expand physics so as to encompass consciousness. What is missing must therefore be something non-physical: to put it provocatively, we must have souls (not necessarily immortal ones, sad to say).  <br />The conclusion seems obvious from McGinn's argument, but McGinn rejects it, mainly by pointing out that it raises some questions to which he has no good answers.  And yet, the best defense of this &quot;dualist&quot; thesis I have seen is by...Colin McGinn!  In a brilliant essay, &quot;Consciousness and Cosmology,&quot;  published in 1993 in Davies&quot; and Humphreys' &quot;Consciousness: Psychological and Philosophical Essays,&quot; McGinn offers a breathtakingly convincing case for a mental realm distinct from the realm of matter.  In that essay, he explains that he is simply offering a picture of what a mind-body dualism would be like if it were really true, but that he himself does not really accept that it is in fact correct.  <br />Yet, the speculative dualism of his 1993 essay seems more solid, more akin to normal scientific theories, that the airy trans-dimensional pseudo-physical speculations offered in &quot;The Mysterious Flame.&quot;  I am tempted to believe that McGinn himself knows this but found it more professionally prudent to present the obvious conclusions of his arguments as mere speculations in the 1993 essay.  <br />Space prevents discussion of the other brilliant and provocative ideas McGinn tosses out in this book.  Although I think his central thesis that humans can never understand the nature of consciousness is mistaken, any scientist who wishes to prove McGinn wrong by actually producing such an explanation of consciousness would do well to familiarize himself with McGinn's work.  <BR> <BR>&quot;The Mysterious Flame&quot; should surely be read together with McGinn's 1993 essay, &quot;Consciousness and Cosmology.&quot;  The two together comprise the most readable, insightful discussion of the mind-body problem which I have yet had the pleasure to read.	2004-01-13

In his introduction, Hilton Kramer declares himself to be a \\"partisan\\" of artistic \\"modernism\\" and a \\"liberal anti-Communist.\\"  These essays are, then, a critique of twentieth-century Western leftist/modernist intellectuals by one of their own.  <br />Much of the book is taken up with denunciations of the Stalinism which was rampant among Western intellectuals in the 1930s and '40s.  Kramer is here generally on target: there is no longer any honest doubt that Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy or that Lillian Hellman was a pathologically dishonest Stalinist stooge.  <br />Even towards those intellectuals who were not tools of Stalinism, Kramer is unsparing.  Although he seems in some ways to admire Mary McCarthy, he declares, \\"Mary McCarthy's politics were like her sex life -- promiscuous and unprincipled, more a question of opportunity than of commitment or belief.\\"  <br />The greater interest of the book lies in the hints Kramer offers the reader as to what went wrong with the whole twentieth-century intellectual enterprise.  The author is never able to draw these hints together into a coherent explanation, perhaps because he himself continues to share the basic premises underlying the twentieth-century intellectual catastrophe.  <br />Ernest Gellner once suggested that the rise of Anglo-American \\"linguistic philosophy\\" in the twentieth century was a consequence of verbalist intellectuals, having been displaced by modern science, trying to create for themselves a new niche which would justify their own skills of verbal manipulation.  <br />The same analysis explains the intellectuals' attraction to both Marxism and \\"modernism.\\" <br />In discussing modern art, Kramer refers approvingly to the \\"culture of modernism, with its 'difficult' texts requiring lengthy and laborious study...\\"  He specifically lavishes praise on Clement Greenberg, one of the most influential of modernist art critics.  <br />Why it is that \\"'difficult' texts requiring lengthy and laborious study...\\"are per se a good thing, Kramer does not say.  The answer of course is that such texts provide a raison d'etre for verbalist intellectuals who possess no actual knowledge or any useful expertise.  Tom Wolfe, in \\"The Painted Word,\\" developed this point in a brutally brilliant (and hilarious) attack on artistic modernism, focusing specifically on Kramer's hero Clem Greenberg: modern art is nothing but illustrations for the insanely convoluted and incomprehensible scribblings of self-important twentieth-century verbalist intellectuals.  <br />Similarly, Marxism assigns to intellectuals a far more exalted status than they would otherwise appear to deserve: whatever the ultimate metaphysical role of the proletariat, it is, in practice, the intellectuals, not the poor workers, who have grasped the Marxian dynamics of history.  It is therefore the intellectuals who are fitted to run the show under Marxism. <br />That modernism and Marxism would appeal to intellectuals is therefore obvious.  But does it matter?  How could a small band of discontented intellectuals affect society at large?  <br />Kramer again offers us hints of how relatively small numbers of leftist/modernist intellectuals spread their influence throughout American society.  Kramer explains that Stalinists insinuated themselves into such \\"capitalist\\" institutions as Time magazine, the New York Times, and the universities, and, in some cases, received monetary subsidies from the Soviet Union.  <br />The Soviets never accepted modern art, so Soviet funds were not available to fund artistic modernism.  Curiously, funding for political leftists who espoused artistic modernism was provided by the American CIA!  Kramer explains in some detail that the CIA-funded \\"Congress for Cultural Freedom\\" exhibited an \\"over dependence on the political Left as the intellectual mainstay of the Congress...\\"  He adds approvingly, and not surprisingly given his own leftist leanings, that this \\"may indeed have been necessary giventhe realities of the moment...\\"<br />The most bizarrely fascinating essay in the book discusses the famous \\"Bloomsbury group\\" -- which included Vrginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes, etc.  The phrase \\"moral decadence\\" is not adequate to capture the picture Kramer paints.  <br />For example, Vanessa Bell, sister of Vrigina Woolf and the pivotal figure in the group, although married to Clive Bell, had a child by Duncan Grant, whose own real romantic interest was not Vanessa Bell but his own gay lover, David Garnett.  In a final weird twist, the gay lover Garnett ended up marrying the illegitimate daughter when she matured.  <br />The Bloomsburyites, who prided themselves on their sexual openness and lack of hypocrisy, kept the whole strange matter secret from the unfortunate girl who thought her biological father was Clive Bell.  <br />In the early twentieth century, the Bloomsbury ethos was the preserve of a tiny group of upper-class aesthetes -- although Bloomsbury member John Maynard Keynes did succeed in selling Western governments upon an economic theory built upon the take-no-thought-for-the-morrow Bloomsbury ethos, with a resulting near collapse in the value of Western currencies.  <br />But that ethos has now trickled down widely to the middle and working class in America, as is illustrated, for example, by the infamous Jerry Springer television program: Springer is a twenty-first century pop-culture version of the Bloomsbury group.<BR>  <BR>As an old-fashioned liberal (what is nowadays called a \\"neoconservative\\"), Hilton Kramer is an apologist for the basic political, social, and cultural institutions of the twentieth century.  While he deplores much of what his intellectual colleagues have done to our society, he lacks the vantage point to see that the early twentieth century liberal \\"advances\\" in the power of government, the structure of education, etc. made this destruction possible.  <br />That Kramer himself is now often dubbed a conservative, rather than, as he himself confesses in his introduction, a liberal, is a sign of the lack of any real conservative alternative or response to the catastrophic social and intellectual decline that constituted the twentieth century.  <br />Nonetheless, if Kramer can offer no cure, \\"Twilight of the Intellectuals\\" is a fascinating and readable look at some of those intellectuals who helped cause the illnesses from which we and our society now suffer.	2004-01-12
US	50146788	R58XK2GD1LH63	0375501568	81872394	Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas	Books	3	44	55	N	N	&quot;If Christ be not risen, our faith is vain.&quot;	A bit over twenty years ago, I had the chance to talk with Elaine Pagels' late husband, Heinz Pagels (he died several years later in a tragic accident).  We were both physicists and happened to be discussing the Big Bang.  I casually used the phrase &quot;the moment of creation&quot; as verbal shorthand for &quot;the moment at which the Big Bang occurred.&quot;  <br />Heinz Pagels reacted badly to my choice of words.  What I had intended as an informal manner of speech, he took to be a religious reference and he made clear that he had very negative feelings towards talk that smacked of religion.  <br />It was only later that I found out that he was married to an internationally-renowned scholar of early Christianity, Elaine Pagels.  <br />Reading Elaine Pagels' &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; gives some insight into why her late husband acquired a severe allergy to talk about religion.  <br />Pagels divides early Christianity into three separate strands.  One strand, represented by the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, sees Jesus as a human being chosen by God and given special powers and responsibilities far beyond those of normal mortal men.  The second strand, represented by the Gospel according to John, sees Jesus as an eternally existing aspect of God who came to earth to save humankind.  <br />Traditional orthodox Christianity is an attempt to meld these strands together into one.  <br />The third strand, represented by the gnostic Gospel of Thomas, agrees with John that there is a streak of divinity in Jesus but claims that such a streak is also present, if only we can uncover it, in every human being -- we are, each of us, Sons of God (or Daughters, as the case may be).  <br />Pagels thinks it a shame that established Christianity rejected this third strand in favor of the dogmatic &quot;Jesus is uniquely God&quot; doctrine which came to constitute Christian orthodoxy.  <br />Like most modern scholars of Christianity and of the New Testament, Pagels simply cannot believe that the carpenter from Nazareth was really God Incarnate, that he was born of a virgin, that he physically rose from the dead, etc.: she states explicitly that &quot;most New Testament scholars&quot; -- herself clearly included -- regard these stories as a &quot;mixture of legend and midrash, that is, storytelling...&quot;  Yet, as she describes in eloquent detail, she has found personal comfort, solace, and charm in many aspects of the Christian story and the cultural accouterments that have been created around Christianity.  <br />In short, Pagels wants to keep the good stuff but throw out the embarrassing theology that strikes her and her colleagues as obvious nonsense.  Her way of doing this is to create an alternate Christianity based on ancient gnosticism, as represented by the Gospel of Thomas.  <br />I sympathize.  I too am charmed by the story of the Nativity, moved by the (mutually contradictory) descriptions of the Crucifixion, and enchanted by Christmas carols, Handel's Messiah, etc.  <br />But, sociologically and psychologically, it will not work. Pagels tries to blame the &quot;wrong turn&quot; on a few early bad fellows, notably the early Bishop, Irenaeus.   However as the history of American religion in the last fifty years shows, the mass of believers want the straightforward, reassuring &quot;old-time religion&quot; embodied in orthodoxy: it is the evangelical churches, teaching unvarnished orthodoxy, which have swelled in membership.  Those churches which have tried to accommodate the doubts and uncertainties of modernity have steadily declined.  And, as Philip Jenkins argues in &quot;The Next Christendom,&quot; the new wave of Christianity in the Third World, which will eventually supplant Euro-American Christianity, is depressingly orthodox.  <br />Pagels herself concedes that non-gnostic orthodoxy (personified by the author of the Gospel of John) &quot;promises great reward: forgiveness of sins, solidarity with God's people, and the power to overcome death.  In place of Thomas's cryptic sayings John offers a simple formula, revealed through the story of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection: 'God loves you; believe, and be saved.'&quot;  Exactly.  <br />But there is an even more basic flaw in Pagels' position.  It suffers from a certain &quot;logocentrism,&quot; a belief that by twisting and turning and manipulating words, we can protect ourselves from unforgiving external reality.  This was the chronic illness of the twentieth century.  <br />For decades, the Societ commissars produced one fantastic &quot;Five-Year Plan&quot; after another, convinced that if only the people would truly believe in the words of the Plan, this Plan would somehow work.  It never did.  The liberal welfare state here in the U.S. and, currently, the neoconservative warfare state have exhibited the same fixation on verbal promises over actual reality.  <br />Pagels offers the same sort of verbal manipulation in the realm of religion: no matter what the reality is, if we can use pretty words to console ourselves, all is well.  <br />Pagels actually quotes Irenaeus denouncing the gnostics' verbal manipulations: Irenaeus declared that while gnostics &quot;say the same things [as orthodox Christians], they mean something different by them.&quot;  Pagels replies, &quot;[W]hat is _wrong_ with that?&quot;<br />Pagels is an engaging, passionate, and informative writer.  However, if one concludes, as Pagels apparently has concluded, that Jesus of Nazareth really did not physically rise from the dead, really was not born of a virgin, etc., the honest tack would be to admit that Jesus was simply an ordinary Joe, no more worthy of worship or adoration than anyone else.  <br />In short, all those, such as Professor Pagels, who wish to move &quot;beyond belief&quot; must, if they are truly honest, move beyond Christianity.  <br />Gnostics, both ancient and modern, want all of the comforts and benefits of true religion, without any of the true commitment or costs.  That is simply dishonest.  <br />And, I suspect, that may explain why Professor Pagels' late husband, twenty years ago, exhibited to me such a profound antagonism towards talk that casually alluded to religion.	2004-01-11
US	50146788	R1R5SBZ8BHNUC3	0226155676	482160603	The Theory of Morality	Books	5	20	23	N	N	Putting Ethics Back on Its Feet	The basic purpose of Alan Donagan's &quot;A Theory of Morality&quot; is to overturn the &quot;meta-ethical&quot; perspective of twentieth-century philosophy of ethics and to re-create ethics as a substantive discipline.<br />There are two basic questions in ethical philosophy.  First, what are the contents of morality.  Second, why should (or shouldn't) we bother to adhere to the precepts of morality.<br />Logically, the first question would seem to be prior to the second: after all, how can you decide whether or why to be moral until you have some reasonably clear idea as to what being moral actually consists of?<br />It would be as if one were converting to Islam (or Hinduism or Mormonism or whatever) before bothering to ascertain what Islam, Mormonism, or Hinduism actually consisted of.<br />Yet, twentieth-century philosophers curiously inverted the order of the two basic questions.  Most of twentieth-century ethical philosophy consisted of trying to invent reasons why people should be moral before having made clear what constituted &quot;being moral.&quot;<br />Even honest attempts to found substantive theories of morality did not start with the contents of morality but rather with trying to uncover motives that might be sufficient to motivate people to behave morally.  Once such motives were identified, a moral system was constructed that might manage to appease these motives.<br />For example, Tara Smith begins her recent book, &quot;Viable Values,&quot; by declaring, &quot;My immediate concern is not so much with how to be moral as it is with why one should be moral...The source of moral authority is logically prior to the contents of moral prescriptions...&quot;<br />The moral cart was thereby pulling the moral horse.<br />Alan Donagan's goal in this brilliant but largely neglected masterpiece was to put the horse back where it belonged.<br />Donagan's central insight is that, while we may differ wildly on meta-ethical issues such as the metaphysical foundations of morality, the ontological standing of moral utterances, etc., we nonetheless pretty much all have an understanding of the basic down-to-earth precepts of morality: thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not lie, etc.<br />There may of course be difficult cases and gray areas (how to treat a fetus, how to deal with the terminally ill, etc.), but if you were to announce that you have created an &quot;alternate morality&quot; which demands incessant lying, stealing, murdering, etc., you would not really be offering to change morality but would merely be announcing your intent to abandon morality.<br />In short, you would not have engaged in a philosophical innovation but merely have revealed your own lack of moral character.<br />Donagan calls this generally understood moral core &quot;common morality.&quot;<br />He takes this, largely undisputed, moral core and from it inductively generalizes to the principle underlying common morality.  Donagan argues, convincingly, that the underlying concept of common morality can be expressed quite simply: &quot;Act always so that you respect every human being, yourself or another, as being a rational creature.&quot;  (He cogently argues that this is a clearer statement of the Kantian categorical imperative which holds that one must treat human beings always as ends in themselves and never merely as means.)<br />It is in fact fairly easy to see the connection between the precepts of common morality and the fact that man is a rational animal.  Respect for truth, for rights of property, etc. simply makes no sense for beings not capable of rationality.  A dog, after all, can not lie or violate property rights.  Conversely, it is clear enough why a system of rules enjoining truthfulness, respect for others' rights, etc. is of value to rational beings.<br />Once we have a clear view of the underlying nature of morality, it is then possible to move forward clearing up various inconsistencies, filling in variousdetails, and exploring differing motives that would cause people to behave morally.<br />Donagan does explore many of the substantive details of morality.  While one can (and I do) disagree with Donagan on some of these details, his overall framework for morality makes possible reasoned debate and argument rather than mere emotional squabbling over arbitrary &quot;personal values.&quot;<br />Just as an understanding of human nutrition should precede formulation of a detailed dieting plan, so also an understanding of the nature and contents of morality must precede the formulation of any plan to get people to behave morally.  And just as there may be many motives for dieting, so also we should expect there to be various complementary motives causing people to behave morally.<br />Donagan does not probe in detail into the motives for behaving morally but there is clearly a variety of such motives: sympathy for other humans, one's own opinion of oneself, respect for rationality per se, etc.  What Donagan does do is demolish the false presumption that there must be one single motive for behaving morally and that one must first find this one single motive for morality before one can move on to the substance of morality.<br />Donagan modestly suggests that the understanding of the nature of morality which he presents might be specific to the Western tradition.<br />On this point, he is overly modest.  While the view of morality he presents may, as he claims, have been made most explicit in the West (starting with Aristotle and continuing as late as Kant), it is surely implicit in the moral views of all human civilizations.  A human culture which does not, for the most part, require respect for humans as rational beings is a human culture that is unlikely to survive.<br />For recent books which, while readable, exhibit the unfortunate sterility of typical twentieth-century ethical philosophy, I suggest Simon Blackburn's &quot;Being Good&quot; and Tara Smith's &quot;ViableValues.&quot;  As thought-provoking complements to Donagan's book, try John Mackie's &quot;Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong,&quot; Ayn Rand's &quot;The Virtue of Selfishness,&quot; Robert Wright's &quot;The Moral Animal,&quot; and Murray Rothbard's &quot;The Ethics of Liberty.&quot;	2004-01-09

The ostensible theme, as indicated in the subtitle, is \\"China's plan to dominate...the world.\\"  But what Mosher actually makes a case for is not China's goal to become a world-dominating hegemon itself but rather Chinese opposition to the current reality of the United States' actually being hegemon of the world.  <br />It is only in a final footnote that Mosher openly reveals his agenda: \\"We need make no apology for striving to maintain America's global primacy, the chief threat to which is the emergence of China...\\" (p. 183).  However, throughout the book the underlying theme is that China is pursuing the path of evil whenever the Chinese refuse to accept their proper position of subservience towards the United States.  In his introductory chapter, he condemns China for its desire, in Mosher's words, to \\"oppose and undermine the current Pax Americana\\" (p. 9).  On the same page he approvingly quotes Zbigniew Brzezinski for condemning China for attempting to \\"peacefully defeat American hegemony.\\"  <br />And yet, despite these clear acknowledgements that the actual current world hegemon is the United States, Mosher defines \\"hegemony\\" as \\"the non-Western notion that the premier goal of foreign policy should be to establish absolute dominance over one's region and, by slow extension, the world\\" (p.2). To seriously believe that this is a \\"non-Western notion\\" one would not only have to ignore the current status of the United States but also the historical behavior of numerous Western political leaders from Alexander the Great to Napoleon to Adolf Hitler.  Mosher knows better.  <br />What Mosher does actually succeed in demonstrating is that China has historically been the dominant power in East Asia and that most Chinese expect and hope that it will once again achieve that pre-eminence within its own region.  In his fifth chapter, \\"The World Map of Hegemony,\\" he explores in great detail various speculativehypotheses as to how China might expand its dominance in eastern Asia.  As to any possible world-wide reach, however, Mosher restricts himself to two brief sentences, merely suggesting vaguely without argument or evidence that somehow China might someday seek to \\"extend its reach into the Middle East and Africa.  Like the Soviet Union at its height, it might even seek satellites in the Americas\\"  (p. 113).  <br />That's it.  That is Steve Mosher's entire case that China has a plan to \\"dominate...the world.\\"  The careful reader will search in vain for any discussion anywhere in the book that presents any evidence at all that China seeks dominance outside of its East Asia heartland.  <br />I will not mention again the factual errors which other reviewers have pointed out. I did find it amusing that Mosher attributes an incident between China and England which occurred, Mosher says, in 1792 during the reign of the English King George III, to the Kangxi emperor: even casual students of Chinese history know that the Kangxi emperor, one of the most famous of later Chinese emperors, ruled in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, dying in 1722, seventy years before the incident Mosher mentions.  <br />This would be like placing the American Civil War in the Presidency of George Washington.  Mosher relies on the utter ignorance most Americans have of Chinese history to pass off his shoddy scholarship as serious knowledge of China.  <br />Why did Steve Mosher do this?  He briefly mentions his own mistreatment at the hands of the Beijing regime twenty years ago: he clearly has a personal axe to grind.  And, of course, the Communist regime, in its Maoist phase, was one of the most murderous governments in human history, surpassing even Hitler. And, although the current regime is an enormous improvement over Maoist totalitarianism, it nonetheless still engages in serious violations of human rights.  <br />But none of this explains outright lying.  The truth, I fear, is that Mosher has chosen to align himself with the dominant elite in the United States which is determined to maintain and expand the current American world hegemony at any cost.  <br />After the 9/11 terrorist atrocity, the public exposure of the neo-conservative weapons-of-mass-destruction scam, and the escalating quagmire in Iraq, it seems almost quaint to focus on the risk posed by China to the American world empire.  But the issue is, in truth, still timely.  Despite the fear of Islamic terrorism, the Iraq adventure demonstrates the fact that no Moslem regime actually has the military strength to withstand the American military in a direct confrontation.  <br />In the long-term, only China has the strength and resources to thwart America's drive for unchallenged world domination.  <br />Eventually, the Mideast situation will cool down, the neo-conservative fanatics who plotted the Iraq debacle will fall from power, and the more sober wing of the American establishment will regain control of American foreign policy.  <br />At that point, we can expect more propaganda of the sort fabricated by Mosher, trying to convince the world that anyone who resists American hegemony is really the true danger to world peace.  <br />The lies will only be believed in the U.S., but they will no doubt strengthen American resolve to defend its hegemonic position. <br />The fundamental interest of Mosher's book lies not in the information it provides which, given his slipshod scholarship, is nearly worthless.  Its real interest lies in the peek it provides into the propaganda techniques that will be used to maintain and expand the imperial power of the American hegemon.	2004-01-09

For example, early in \\"Being Good\\" (p.3), Blackburn declares that \\"Like America in the post-war McCarthy era, it [the Nazi regime] feared pollution from 'degenerates' outside or within.\\"  One need not be an admirer of the late Senator from Wisconsin to recognize that comparing Nazism to McCarthyism betrays an unbelievable moral obtuseness: for all of his many faults, Senator McCarthy, after all, did not murder anyone.  Furthermore, the opening of the Soviet archives and release of the U.S. \\"Venona\\" intercepts have proven conclusively that there really were a number of Soviet agents who had infiltrated the U.S. government (see, e.g., Weinstein's and Vassiliev's \\"Haunted Wood,\\" Klehr's and Haynes' \\"Venona,\\" and Romerstein's and Breindel's \\"The Venona Secrets,\\" all available on Amazon).         <br />Later in the book (p. 103), Si announces that \\"the law does not protect...speech inciting racial and other hatreds...\\"  Maybe not in merrie olde England, Si, but over here in the former colonies we have a First Amendment which does indeed protect even the right, say, of crazy neo-Nazis to present their views.  This remark immediately precedes an incredibly muddled discussion of \\"natural rights,\\" in which Blackburn admits (and demonstrates) a complete inability to make any coherent sense of the idea of natural rights at all.  It isn't a difficult concept: you have a \\"natural right\\" to something if and only if you can naturally enjoy it absent involvement or interference from other human beings.  Thus, you do not have a \\"natural right\\" to free medical care or food or housing, none of which you would possess naturally without the involvement of other human beings, but you do have a natural right not to be murdered, mugged, etc., since clearly you are free of such indignities absent involvement of other human beings.  Whether \\"natural rights\\" are an adequate foundation for a political order is another question, but the concept itself is neither confusing nor difficult (for a modern exposition see Murray Rothbard's \\"The Ethics of Liberty\\"). <br />Elsewhere, Blackburn dogmatically declares, \\"'Slippery slope' reasoning needs to be resisted...everywhere.\\"  \\"Slippery slope\\" reasoning is the sort of argument that claims that if we begin by depriving the Jews of basic civil rights and making them second-class citizens we risk sliding down a \\"slippery slope\\" to a point where we finally commit the atrocity of murdering millions of Jews: therefore, we must never start on the \\"slippery slope\\" in the first place.  As this historical example indicates, contrary to Blackburn's blanket anathema, \\"slippery slope\\" arguments are sometimes very appropriate indeed.  <br />But does any of this matter?  Isn't an ethical theorist entitled to a few silly remarks if his overarching grand theory provides a framework for the ethical life?  <br />The problem is that the central theme of Blackburn's book is that there is no such grand overarching framework.  The best we can do, he argues, is muddle around, consider individual issues, and try to hammer out some sensible conclusion.  This is what Si himself does in this book, and, as the previous examples demonstrate, he does it incredibly badly.  <br />Blackburn sums up his perspective in his concluding section, \\"...we need recognition in the eyes of others...From within our self-understanding, we can admit that these standards are ours--just ours.\\"  In the end, ethics as Si presents it is just shoddy self-satisfaction and a sleazy bid for social recognition.  <br />The Western philosophical tradition, going back to Aristotle, took a less flippant view.  It held that by acknowledging the basic biological and metaphysical fact of man's nature as a rational animal we can understand that certain moral rules, values, and virtues enable humans living in communities to exercise their rational nature in pursuit of survival and happiness.  <br />This was the starting point of ethics: what exactly are the appropriate rules, values, and virtues which show respect for rational beings?  And, secondly, once we have discovered these rules, values, and virtues, what can and should induce people to adhere to these rules, pursue these values, and develop these virtues?  Those questions posed the subject matter of ethics.  Ethics was not a parlor game to enable over-paid, under-worked Cambridge dons to feel good about themselves; ethics was about the constraints imposed upon human life and human communities by the facts of human nature.   <br />To be sure, \\"Being Good\\" is at least readable if vapid; whereas, most twentieth-century academic philosophers were both inane and unreadable. <br />But, in most respects, Blackburn's facile and silly little book is indeed representative of the disastrous industry of academic philosophical ethics which played its own small role in the tragedies of the twentieth century.    <br />Don't waste your time and money -- you can get equally good insights on ethics faster and cheaper from the average bartender.  If you want to begin grappling with the real issues of ethics, try Alan Donagan's \\"The Theory of Morality,\\" Murray Rothbard's \\"The Ethics of Liberty,\\" John Mackie's \\"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong,\\" Ayn Rand's \\"The Virtue of Selfishness,\\" and Robert Wright's \\"The Moral Animal.\\"  Those five authors differ on a host of issues, but at least they understand that ethics is not just a self-congratulatory game of feeling good about yourself and your fellow faculty members.	2004-01-09

Before you start reading Baron-Cohen's fascinating book, go through the questionaire in the first appendix. <br />The questionaire, \\"Reading the Mind in the Eyes,\\" has thirty-six photos cropped to show only the region around the eyes.  By looking only at this small portion of the face, you have to figure out the emotion being expressed by the individual in the photo.  <br />Chance would give only one out of four right answers.  As Baron-Cohen remarks in the text, most people, when they take the quiz, find it extremely difficult -- one feels like one is guessing.  <br />In fact, nearly everyone does much better than he or she expected.  I got nearly two-thirds correct, and most people do even better.  <br />This little quiz demonstrates one of the key points in the book: normal humans have an incredible ability to read the expressions, feelings, etc. of their fellow human beings from very subtle clues.  <br />Baron-Cohen's thesis in his earlier book, \\"Mindblindness,\\" was that autistic persons are simply people who lack this normal human \\"mind-reading\\" ability.  <br />\\"The Essential Difference\\" expands this thesis to argue that, in this respect, autistic people are simply at a far end of a spectrum.  Females (with numerous individual exceptions) tend towards the opposite end of the spectrum from autistic people: females are usually good empathizers, skilled at \\"mind-reading.\\"  Males tend to be less good at empathizing compared to females and better at \\"systemizing.\\"  Autistic people (who are predominantly male) lie at the extreme male end of the spectrum -- extraordinarily poor empathizers, good systemizers.  <br />The author proves this case beyond reasonable doubt by both covering the scientific evidence and wittily discussing case studies.  He focuses particularly on \\"high-functioning autism\\" and \\"Asperger's syndrome,\\" exemplified by people who have normal to high intelligence and are able to function to some degree in normal society but who nonetheless exhibit a significant degree of mind-blindness.  <br />So is there anything wrong with the book?  <br />Baron-Cohen leans over backwards to emphasize that individuals who lean towards the high-systemizing/low-empathizing end of the spectrum are not deficient human beings or uncaring monsters.  He states explicitly, \\"People with autism are often the most loyal defenders of someone they perceive to be suffering an injustice.\\" Yet, in other places in the book, he suggests that it is easier for those who tend towards systemizing rather than empathizing to commit rape or murder!  <br />The problem is an ambiguity in the word \\"empathy.\\"  On the one hand, it means the ability to read another's mood, to decode subtle cues of face, tone of voice, etc.  As Baron-Cohen puts it, \\"Empathizing is about spontaneously and naturally tuning into the other person's thoughts and feelings...\\"  <br />But, an alternative sense of \\"empathy\\" refers to an individual's ability to imaginatively put himself in the other person's position, to imagine how he himself would feel were he subjected to similar treatment.  <br />The two meanings are very different.  In the first sense, one cannot really have \\"empathy\\" for the subject of a newspaper story: without direct personal contact, you have no cues of facial expression and tone of voice to enable you to \\"naturally and spontaneously\\" tune in to the person's feelings.  But, of course, in the second sense of \\"empathy,\\" one might indeed, by imaginatively putting oneself in the same situation, achieve empathy for the person described in the news story.  <br />Those who incline towards the Asperger's-syndrome/systemizing end of Baron-Cohen's behavioral spectrum lack \\"empathy\\" in the first sense of the word: i.e., they are lacking in the ability to spontaneously decode other people's feelings and intentions in direct social interaction.  They lack a perceptual skill.  <br />But, they still can (and they often do, as Baron-Cohen's comment about outrage towards injustice indicates) possess empathy in the second sense: this empathy relies on a conscious act of imagination and psychological projection, not on a perceptual ability to \\"psych out\\" other people.  <br />Indeed, since there are some people (actors, con artists, some sorts of psychopaths) who possess the ability to convincingly project false cues of their feelings and intentions, people who are receptive to such cues (empathizers in Baron-Cohen's sense of the word) may be more likely to be deceived than those whose empathy is based on thought and imagination rather than instinctual response.  <br />To put it concretely, Hitler might have found it easier to appeal to \\"empathizers\\" in Baron-Cohen's sense of the word than to people with Asperger's syndrome!  <br />I am also somewhat skeptical of Baron-Cohen's hypothesis that severe autism is nothing but an exaggeration of normal male behavior.  The \\"mindblindness\\" exhibited by those with severe autism is so debilitating that it seems likely that there is some underlying physiological cause.  On the other hand, the moderately low level of empathizing seen among most males and, to a somewhat greater degree, among those with Asperger's syndrome is more easily explained simply as a matter of focus and interest.  <br />Frankly, as a physicist, I find those people who might be deemed \\"normal\\" by Baron-Cohen's criteria to be people who demonstrate an extraordinarily unhealthy obsession with their fellow human beings.  Humans are an interesting and important part of the universe -- but they're not everything!  A small touch of Asperger's syndrome is, from the perspective of the universe at large, clearly more sane than what is generally considered \\"normalcy.\\"<br />And, yet, I suspect that Baron-Cohen would listen patiently to such objections, acknowledge their possible validity, and consider how they could be validated or refuted.  He comes across as a man motivated more by a passion for truth than a desire to win an argument.  <br />\\"The Essential Difference\\" does not have, and does not claim to have, the final answers.  But it does raise some fascinating questions and present the current state of knowledge in an informative, understandable, and entertaining manner.  If you have any interest at all in the nature of your fellow human beings, it is worth reading.	2004-01-04

In his introduction, John McManus quotes from a 1952 essay by William F. Buckley, Jr. published in the Catholic magazine Commonweal.  Buckley wrote:<br />&quot;...we have got to accept Big Government for the duration -- for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged, given our present government skills, except through the instrument of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores...&quot;<br />I had seen this infamous quote before I read McManus' book, but reading the book motivated me to check the original source in the local university library: McManus is quoting accurately and the quote is not taken out of context.  <br />So, why would a writer, such as Buckley, who has made a career claiming to be an opponent of Big Government and a defender of traditional values and individual rights, endorse a &quot;totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores&quot;?<br />This is the question which McManus' book aims to answer.  <br />McManus is President of the right-wing John Birch society, but, although I myself differ from McManus and his group on a host of issues (ranging from abortion and the Drug War to China policy), I found his book to be well-documented, accurate, and chockful of relevant facts.  <br />Part of McManus' explanation rests on the fact, publicly acknowledged by Buckley, that Buckley was at one time a CIA operative; some of Buckley's closest political associates (e.g.,  James Burnham, Willmoore Kendall) were also CIA operatives.  The CIA's penchant for clandestinely funneling money to useful intellectuals is now a matter of public record (see, e.g., Saunders' &quot;The Cultural Cold War&quot;).  For example, the famous &quot;Congress for Cultural Freedom,&quot; which published the internationally renowned intellectual journal &quot;Encounter,&quot; was eventually admitted by all concerned to be a CIA front.  McManus points out that it is more than credible -- given the CIA's admitted record with the CCF, &quot;Encounter,&quot; etc. -- that Buckley, along with his flagship operation, the magazine &quot;The National Review,&quot; was a CIA front.  <br />To what purpose?  Prior to Buckley, American conservatives had been anti-war and anti-militarist: the right-wing had opposed American involvement in both World War II and Korea.  <br />Buckley changed all that.  <br />Regardless of the possible CIA connection, the Buckley re-definition of conservatism served broader goals of the governing establishment.  As McManus points out, Buckley's strategy consisted of &quot;portraying the Red menace as nearly invincible.  Americans could then be persuaded to accept higher taxation, increasingly onerous controls, and an array of international alliances leading to world government, all under the guise of opposing the external Soviet threat.&quot;  <br />The military draft, the Great Society, federal control of scientific research and higher education, etc. -- to use Buckley's phrase, &quot;a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores,&quot; all justified by the need to confront and out-compete the Soviet Union.  <br />To anyone who suggests that this was not simply a ruse aimed at maintaining political power, McManus points out that the Buckleyites even &quot;red-baited&quot; McManus' own far-right, rabidly anti-Communist John Birch Society!  In October 1965, Buckley's &quot;National Review&quot; accused the Birchers' founder, Robert Welch, of following the &quot;pacifist-Commie line&quot; because Welch had expressed some well-founded doubts about the ill-fated U.S. adventure in Vietnam.  <br />What were Buckley's personal motivations?  McManus quotes an early Buckley associate, Medford Evans: &quot;The reluctant conclusion that I have reached is that William F. Buckley Jr. is and has been driven by vanity, ambition, and greed to seek a place in the Establishment which he professes -- or once professed -- to oppose.&quot; <br />McManus also quotes the populist Kevin Phillips who more colorfully hints that Buckley's actions were due to personal status insecurity (the Buckleys were &quot;New Money,&quot; not old wealth):<br />&quot;There was, of course, a time when Bill Buckley was anti-establishment -- back in the long-ago days when he was an Irish nouveau-riche cheer leader for Joe McCarthy.  But since then he's primed his magazine with cast-off Hapsburg royalty, Englishmen who part their names in the middle, and others calculated to put real lace on Buckley's Celtic curtains.&quot;  <br />Certainly, Buckley's little magazine has, since its inception, reeked of a certain pseudo-sophisticated air that falsely suggested to its readers that the magazine could elevate them to a higher realm of elite taste and intellectual sophistication.  <br />So Bill Buckley is not a real conservative but merely a willing tool of the anti-conservative establishment.  Does it matter?  Buckley is, after all, now in his dotage -- the influential conservatives nowadays are Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, etc.  <br />The answer is that Buckley, for good or ill, succeeded in shaping the American conservative movement in his own image.  If they are not quite Buckley's clones, Limbaugh, Hannity, and Coulter are nonetheless his ideological descendants.  Buckley himself will doubtless soon be dead, but his influence lives on.  <br />Furthermore, just as Buckley and his cohorts found the Cold War to be a useful excuse for creating a &quot;totaliatrain bureacracy within our shores,&quot; so now a newer generation of faux conservatives is using the threat of Islamic terrorism to squelch any authentic anti-establishment, Constitutionalist elements on the Right and to re-establish a Buckleyite &quot;totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores.&quot;  History does repeat itself.  <br />For further discussions, from varying perspectives different from McManus', of Buckley's dominating influence on the American conservative movement, I recommend Raimondo's &quot;Reclaiming the American Right,&quot; Nash's &quot;TheConservative Intellectual Movement in American Since 1945,&quot; and Gottfried's &quot;The Conservative Movement.&quot;	2004-01-01

If Christianity was not the result of divine intervention in human affairs, then it was the social product of the society in which it evovlved. If the ideas and beliefs of the Christians were not revealed by God, then we must find their source in the Greco-Roman world in which they developed.<br />Christianity was created by a pagan society.<br />Christianity must be viewed as the final form taken by paganism, the form in which classical pagan culture was passed down to barbarian Europe and thence to the modern world.<br />This is the theme of Randall's book.<br />When put directly, the point is obvious.  Randall fleshes it out with detailed information and examples.<br />Randall's classic was published decades ago.  Why does his thesis still sound so startling?<br />Fundamentalists are entitled to disagree.  But, many professional &quot;anti-Christians&quot; also have a vested interest in drawing an unwarrantedly sharp distinction between Christians and pagans.  Their picture is simply a naive inversion of the fundamentalist's picture.  Instead of benighted pagans vs. enlightened Christians, anti-Christian polemicists would paint a picture of noble, enlightened pagan culture swallowed up by a dark sea of Christian bigotry and anti-intellectualism.<br />It didn't happen that way.  There was nobility, courage, intellectual curiosity, and humanity among both pagans and Christians.  There was also bigotry, brutality, superstition, and stupidity among both pagans and Christians.These were not two separate cultures, peoples, or civilizations.  Paganism and Christianity are two variations on one civilizational theme.<br />Culturally speaking, we are all pagans, we are all Christians.  When we see Christianity, as Randall urges us to, as the final culmination of paganism, we see Western civilization from a more integral and complete perspective.  We also have a chance to transcend some of the bigotry exhibited through the centuries by both sides of what is, and always has been, one culture and one civilization.	2004-01-01
US	50146788	R3334AGWO4PPI5	0742522431	637837157	Martin Van Buren and the Emergence of American Popular Politics (American Profiles)	Books	5	44	55	N	N	A Tragic Genius and the American Tragedy	Martin van Buren invented the American Democratic Party.<br />More broadly, he was responsible as much as any other single man for the overall political party structure which exists in the United States to this day. <br />Yet, to most of his latter-day countrymen, he is merely one of those forgettable nobodies who inhabited the White House between Andy Jackson and Honest Abe.  <br />Joel Silbey's readable and engaging book tries to correct that historical neglect.  <br />Silbey ably tells the story of van Buren's rise from modest beginnings to dominance of the New York political scene, van Buren's movement to the national stage and his restructuring of the national political party system, his ascendance to the Presidency, and his ultimate failure to attain his long-term political goals.  <br />As fascinating as is the story of van Buren's successes, it is his failures which hold the greatest lessons for posterity.  <br />As a young, loyal Jeffersonain, van Buren early in his career supported &quot;Mr. Madison's War&quot; (the War of 1812).  But the increase in federal power and enhancement of federal legitimacy which came from that war led the country in the direction of expanded federal activity and authority relative to the states.  <br />This offended van Buren's laissez-faire/states-rights Jeffersonian sensibilities.  To combat what he denounced as resurgent Federalism, van Buren created a new political structure around a new political party based on states rights, limited government, and laissez-faire economic policy.  <br />That party was the Jacksonian Democratic Party and, until the end of the nineteenth century, the Democratic Party largely adhered to the principles which van Buren imprinted upon it at its birth.  <br />(It may seem strange to hear that the Democratic Party was, through most of its history, the limited-government/states-rights party in the United States.  Yet, as late as 1928, Frank Kent, in his lengthy &quot;The Democratic Party: A History&quot; defined states rights as the central unifying principle of the Democratic Party.  It was only in the depression of the 1930s that party positions were reversed and the Democrats abandoned the founding principles upon which van Buren had built the party.)  <br />Although the Democrats did generally adhere to van Burenite principles through the nineteenth century, in the course of the nineteenth century the Democratic Party slowly lost its ability to control the nation's destiny.  By the middle of the twentieth century, the party had abandoned all of its founding principles: van Buren would have been appalled by the militarism, welfare-statism, corporate favoritism, and outright imperialism which now characterize the Republic he so loved.  <br />What went wrong?  <br />Van Buren himself was brought low by two intractable problems of nineteenth-century America: imperial expansion and slavery.  As Silbey narrates in detail, van Buren lost the Democratic nomination in 1844 due to his refusal to countenance imperial expansion (the annexation of Texas, which led, ultimately, to the U.S. seizure of half of Mexico).  Van Buren vacillated wildly in his attitudes toward the slave states: as President he was an outspoken enemy of the abolitionists and ally of the slave power, but in 1848 he became the Presidential candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party.  <br />In his final years, van Buren endorsed Abraham Lincoln's military crusade against the slave states, a crusade that decisively destroyed the states-rights position which had been the guiding star of van Buren's political life.  <br />But perhaps the ultimate problem, which van Buren failed to perceive, was the inner logic of the Constitutional structure established in 1787.  The Constitution, unlike the preceding Articles of Confederation, created a strong federal Executive and granted the power of taxation to the central government: the Constitutional system was, in its intrinsic logic, despite the Founders'intentions, not a confederation of sovereign states but a centralized, national government.  <br />Of course, neither the actual text of the Constitution nor the intentions of its authors mandated the huge, interventionist, imperialist federal government which we possess today.  But to believe, as the Framers and van Buren did believe, that the Constitutional government could be prevented from turning into an all-encompassing leviathan was politically naive.  <br />So great was van Buren's political genius (he was known in his time as the &quot;Little Magician&quot;) that he almost succeeded in his grand historical aims.  For over three decades, until the catastrophe of the War Between the States, the poltical structures created by van Buren succeeded in defying the logic of history and keeping America as a decentralized federation rather than a centralized nation-state.  <br />But van Buren's grand design for a strictly limited federal government was ultimately wrecked by the War Between the States and by the economic and geopolitical disasters of the twentieth century.  <br />In our own day, both American citizens and all the nations of the world must confront the results of van Buren's historically tragic failure.  Can the federal government of the United States of America somehow be restrained in either its domestic powers or its international adventurism?  Silbey's brief but fascinating book is a cautionary warning to all who now grapple with this central problem facing the human race.	2004-01-01
US	50146788	R2X91PZ3ITJPPK	0301710147	555611729	Jesus of the Early Christians	Books	5	22	24	N	N	Jesus Said, "The Truth Shall Make You Free"	There is a scandal in American churches far deeper than the occasional shenanigans of televangelists or the ongoing crisis afflicting the Catholic priesthood.<br />The truth is that almost none of the serious historians, theologians, or scholars within the Christian churches believes that the doctrines proclaimed from the pulpit every Sunday are actually true.<br />G. A. Wells' book, \\"The Jesus of the Early Christians,\\" explains in layman's terms why it is that no competent and honest scholar within the Christian churches can any longer be a true believer.<br />This is not a bitterly polemical book out to destroy all vestiges of Christianity or Christian behavior: As Wells has written elsewhere, \\"I have tried to avoid the rancor which mars much that atheists have written on Christianity...Nearly all the authorities whose views I quote...are Christian theologians...In the few instances where I have been able to meet some of these theologians personally, I have learned to respect them not only as scholars but as men.\\"<br />While critical of the contemporary Christianity of the Sunday pulpit, Wells' book is therefore neither an attack on Christian ethics nor an expose of Christian practices. Wells is solely concerned with the factual, historical claims made by the New Testament about Jesus of Nazareth and with the historical and textual evidence uncovered by scholars concerning whether those claims are true. To those with no concern as to whether the Gospel reports are actually true, Wells has remarked, in a different context, \\"If however the believer is prepared to disregard questions of mere historical fact, and concentrate on some kind of 'higher' truth which is embodied in the gospels, then my views need not concern him, any more than his concern me.\\"<br />What \\"The Jesus of the Early Christians\\" does do is reveal in straightforward, readable prose all of the little secrets which the Christian theologians have kept out of the Sunday sermons.<br />For example, as Wells presents in detail (p.34) Matthew i and Luke iii both present detailed genealogies for Jesus; unfortunately the two genealogies contradict each other. Grossly. At least one of the evangelists was faking it.<br />Similarly, Wells shows that the census under Caesar Augustus \\"that all the world should be taxed\\" \\"when Cyrenius was governor of Syria\\" and \\"in the days of Herod the king of Judaea\\" was simply an historical fiction constructed by the author of Luke to get the Holy Family from Nazareth to the Biblically blessed City of David. Wells further shows that the slaughter by Herod of all children two and under described in Matthew ii is also contrary to history: somebody made the story up.<br />But the book goes beyond merely exposing Biblical errors and contradictions. Wells discusses in detail the origin of the Gospels, explores the relation of the letters of Paul to the Gospels, explains pagan precedents and sources for Christians' beliefs, and discusses more broadly the issues of how we can discover historical truth and untangle myth from reality.<br />In short, this is, for the layperson, simply the best and most readable introduction to New Testament studies and the historical origins of Christianity that I have yet seen (and I have looked at many). It is the only such introduction that I know of which is based neither on a religious precommitment to Christian dogma nor on a dogmatic hatred or contempt for Christianity but which is rather based on a desire to simply and uncompromisingly explore the unvarnished truth. <br />Twenty years ago, a friend of mine who was a committed evangelical fundamentalist entered (a very conservative) seminary with the goal of becoming a preacher. By the time he had completed his studies, he confessed to me that he no longer had his fundamentalist faith: after learning New Testament Greek, studying the original texts of the Gospels, and being exposed to the scholarly research of the last three centuries, it was impossible forhim any longer to believe in the literal truth of the New Testament.<br />What my friend learned traumatically and painstakingly through his seminary experience, you can learn less painfully by reading \\"The Jesus of the Early Christians.\\"  <br />You may not end up agreeing with all of Wells' conclusions: Wells himself, in later books, changed his opinions on various points (the relative importance of pagan vs. Jewish influences on Christian myths, the likelihood that Jesus was purely mythical rather than a real figure about whom various legends later grew up, etc.).<br />But, if you read this book, you will no longer be in the dark concerning information which all serious scholars of Christianity take for granted but which is rarely mentioned to the ordinary man or woman sitting in the pew on Sunday morning.<br />As the Man from Galilee is said to have declared long ago, \\"The truth shall make you free.\\"<br />(Sadly, this book is currently out of print. Although Wells' later books on this subject are also worth reading, this is still the best introduction and is worth obtaining from a university library or a used book shop. I also recommend Dungan and Cartlidge's \\"Documents for the Study of the Gospels,\\" which nicely complements Wells' book and is happily available here on amazon.)<br />-- David H. Miller	2002-12-04

John Lilburne, a brilliant pamphleteer and a passionately courageous political agitator, was the most prominent leader of the paleo-libertarian \\"Leveller\\" movement during the English Civil War of the seventeenth century.<br />Lilburne was tossed into prison both under the monarchy of Charles I and by the republican regime of Oliver Cromwell. Lilburne was a fervent defender of freedom of speech, of the press, and of religion. He was also an unyielding supporter of economic freedom and of the rights of private property.<br />Pauline Gregg, herself a democratic socialist, found it difficult to comprehend how Lilburne could be both a defender of civil liberties and a proponent of economic freedom, but she nonetheless accurately reports Lilburne's beliefs and libertarian philosophy. In a brief review, it is difficult to convey how vividly Gregg depicts the events Lilburne experienced and the courage and integrity which illuminated Lilburne's life.<br />Aside from his political commitments, Lilburne was also, from a mainstream twenty-first-century perspective, a religious fanatic: metaphorically speaking, he was \\"drunk on God.\\" In terms of understanding the history of natural-rights/libertarian philosophy, this is a crucial fact: historically speaking, the Lockean libertarian philosophy of the American founding was born among passionate evangelical Christians, such as John Lilburne, in seventeenth-century Britain.<br />That historical fact is an embarrassment to modern mainstream libertarians. The mainstream modern libertarian movement, whether in the Libertarian Party, in the \\"Objectivist\\" movement founded by Ayn Rand, or in various independent think tanks, is firmly anti-religious and is dedicated to an \\"anything-goes\\" philosophy that hates government becuase of a hatred of any sort of social or ethical authority which restrains an individual from pursuing his or her own individual whims and desires.<br />Free-Born John is a reproach to these modern-day \\"libertarians.\\"Lilburne would surely have agreed with present-day libertarians about ending the War on Drugs, abolishing the income tax, etc. But Lilburne would have seen liberation from paternalistic government and the reinstatement of natural rights as merely the first step along a path upon which an individual tried to live his life as a creature made in the image of God.<br />There is a dissident movement among modern libertarians, the so-called \\"paleo-libertarians,\\" who take the natural-law, natural-rights perspective of John Lilburne seriously (the paleos are best represented by the Mises Institute and the Center for Libertarian Studies, both of whom offer Websites and a number of books which are available here on amazon.com). Unlike the libertarian mainstream, the \\"paleos\\" are not reflexively hostile to religion, hateful of any social authority or traditions, nor focused solely on the satisfaction of egoistic, material desires.<br />If you are a \\"paleo-libertarian,\\" you will love this book. If you are a mainstream libertarian or a non-libertarian, you will find John Lilburne as enigmatic as did Ms. Gregg. But if you make the effort to understand this man's mind and character, you may come to better understand the nature of human liberty and of the human condition.	2002-11-18

Among the interesting tidbits in the book is an explanation of why the issue of slavery's expansion into the territories was so hot even though the remaining territories were clearly inhospitable to slavery (answer: both North and South viewed it as America's Manifest Destiny to continue expanding southward into Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean), and the curious story of how Major Anderson, the North's \\"hero\\" of Fort Sumter was actually pro-secession and tried heroically to avoid Sumter's becoming the spark that ignited Civil War. It is interesting to compare Stampp's book to Charles Adams' recent When In the Course of Human Events; also worth perusing is Jeff Hummel's Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men.	2001-04-03
