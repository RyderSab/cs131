But this story line is one that sets my teeth on edge.  The heroine Parris professes to have loved the hero Dominick for as long as she can remember, however she never fails to believe the worst of him.  She believes everyone including her B**** of a sister who wouldn't know the truth if it bit her on the a**.  So how great can this love be. <br />Dominick continuely tries to seduce Parris instead of talking to her.  He wants to bed her but can't seem to communicate how he feels and why.  In fact they both bumble along through the entire book making one mistake after the other.  It isn't until the last few chapters that they finally work things out.<br />I have loved the rest of Ms George's books, but this one forced to read the last two chapters and put it away.	2003-06-16

I have always loved Ms Woodiwiss' books in fact I have all of them in Hard Back.  The two biggest problems with this book is that the print is way to small and it has about 100 pages too long.<br />Ms Woodiwiss seems to get too involved in her secondary characters leaving Arianna and Colton to suffer along.  The story between these two strong and intelligent people gets lost in the prose.  Colton seems shallow and in the beginning 2 diminesional.  Arianna is spoiled and to easily irrated to like in the beginning as well.  It is not until the last third of the book that the story takes on any life.<br />I was nore than a little disappointed with the book.  Since the author has put out so few I always eagerly await the next one.  I hope she finds her muse for the next one.	2003-06-16

The next thing is that I am not sure I want to read how the romance between Richard, Jean-Claude, and Anita develops when it ends so badly in this book.<br />The writing is very good, but this is not for the faith of heart.  There are scenes of violence and killing and the BDSM underworld.  The villian is completely unredeemable.

I really enjoyed Jaid Black's story \\"Besieged\\".  Ms Black writes believable and enduring characters.  Peggy came across as a typical career women trapped in an ancient society that treats women as chattel. Wolf is the typical Viking set on capturing a bride.  They grow to love each other and work together to find a way to make their lives together work.  I recommend anything that Jaid Black writes.<br />J.W. McKenna's story is about a group of wealthy men that come together to hunt (really with paint guns and all) human prey.  In this case a woman.  The organizer of the hunt has done this before to other women.  Amy is kidnapped and told the rules of the game.  She is bound and determined that she will need be gang raped by a bunch of wealthy perverts.  She gives them a run for their money and wins.  Ms McKenna's stories are not for the weak of heart.<br />These are explicit stories.  If you are not into naked women and lots of sex don't buy this book.	2003-01-23

Ms Oh present a dominate and submissive relationship that develops into love.  Mark is a caring dominate. He does seem to care about Annie in his own way.  I don't think it is the same way Annie cares about him.  Annie would and does endure just about anything to please Mark.  However, I am not certain that someone that is referred to as Cast Iron Cavendish would allow some of these things without more of a fight.  Mark does use a lot of coercion and intimidation to get Annie to do what he wants.  Annie likes Mark and loves the sex that they share.  But when she becomes unsure or confused, Mark's response is that she was excited by the experience.  <br />Mark takes Annie from a normal relationship to a D/s relationship in a every short time.  Mark pushes Annie all the way never giving her time to really think about what is going on.  He never explains what will happen until the last minute.  Surpising Annie at a time that she can't comfortably back out.  Even at the end of the book she is still confused and uncertain.<br />I would like to see a continuation of the story to see is Annie will actually marry Mark.  Their realtionship has only been on the weekends and one 10 day holiday to the coast, in a span of 4 or 5 weeks.  At present Annie has a great deal of time to herself to be with her friends and do what she likes.  In a fulltime relationship with Mark I do not think that would be the case.  <br />Like I said I have thought alot about the book.  I have even read it more than once.  The story is well written. The characters are well defined.  The scenes believable.  There is something here that I continue to question, but I can't seem to catch it.  Of course this is what good fiction should do is make you question and examine how you feel about what you read.	2003-01-23

The book goes back and forth between the lives of Submit and Graham.  Graham is a carefree (on the surface) rich lord, who experiments with fireworks, drinks and carouses.  Typical for most title gentlemen in England.  He is however a very complicated man, having been past from pillar to post most of his life.  The cousin who finally takes him in to raise never seems to understand the boy.  He is therefore rebellious.  He gets into some trouble in school that is treated rather harshly, which also goes a long way in his mental development.  He therefore feels like he is apart from the rest of the community he lives in.  Submit's father wanted her to marry a title, so she was sent from one boarding school to the next to become a lady.  Her father is a real jerk and obviously never really love her.  She marries a much older man to satisfy her father.  Henry, Submit's husband, also raised Graham.  Henry seems to be a very ridged and set in his ways.  When he dies a request in his will brings Submit and Graham together.  They don't come together romantically until the last 75 to 100 pages of the book.  This is a well written book, but if you are looking for escapism don't read it.	2002-11-06

A father grieving over the loss of a son adopts a street urchin.  He pays for education and transformation into a lady.  Jessie has always loved Matt and now that she is a lady she wants to be his wife.  Matt's father also wants Matt and Jessie to marry.  Matt wants Jessie very much, but he cannot seem to get past the fact that is the daughter of prositute.  You go through most of the book before Matt gets drunk enough to kidnap Jessie on her wedding day.  They marry to save Jessie's reputation.  Jessie feels guilty because she leads Matt to believe that more happen the night of the kidnapping that what really did.  Matt is guilty because of what he did.  A brush with death convinces Matt that he loves Jessie and most tell her.  My one gripe with the story is that when Jessie's past comes out, she doesn't stay and fight she runs away.  Since she jas fought so hard to gain what she has, this seemed out of character.	2002-10-22

After finishing Chritine Feehans series, I was hoping to find a similiar Vampire series. This book came up on my recommend list so I decide to read it. This is definitely a different variation on the legend. Maggie is a vampire who doesn't wish to be. She kills very seldom and has guilty feeings almost every time. She once love a confederate captain who was killed by a fellow vampire who is obessed with her. This is a story of reincarnation and the power fo true love. Sean Canady falls in love with Maggie and is determined to marry her. Maggie is in love with Sean, but is afraid to show him because of the past. This is a intricately plotted book that requires the reader to pay attention, as there are two story lines going and lots of secondary characters to keep track of. This story also introduces the King of the Vampires, Lucian. An arrogrant, overbearing, and very sexual being. He does have compassion for Maggie and shows Sean how to defeat the evil that hunts Maggie. I look forward to Lucian's story. I will definitely read the rest of the series.	2002-09-29

The story was better written and the characters more realistic.  Although there were times that I would have liked to slap both characters and tell them to get over themselves,the story was interesting.  Richard thinks that the only way to save himself from what he thinks is the cardinal sin of lust joins a monastry.  Isabel who was fostered in the same household and fell in love with Richard prays that he will marry her.  In an ironic twist of fate both Richard's brother die.

Isabel just wants Richard to make love to her.  She does start to feel guilty that so many had to die for her to have Richard.  When they finally consummate their marriage it is done very poorly.

I think that is the reason so many are disappointed.  There is not the misunderstanding or a mystery to be solved.  It is a story of a young girl forced by an uncaring parent to marry well to pay his bills.  Jason needs a wife.  He dosn't care who she is as long as she will allow him to continue his life as it is.  Jason fill in love when he was 21 and because of the rejection has never loved again.  Richard, who appears in several of Putney's later books, is a wounded cavalry officer who finds out he is an earl.  Richard meets Caroline and they realize they share very similar view on life.  They fall in love.  Jason realizes that Caroline is definitely not the type of women he can spend any time with.  Especially when he meets Jessica, Caroline's aunt.  Jessica is the women he fill in love with when he was 21.  Jessica still loves Jason and wants very madly to marry him.  The story of course follows its course to suitable solution.  Reggie Devonpoert, &quot;The Rake&quot;, is introduced here as the villian.  I would recommend the book, with the note that there are no love scenes and very little passion in the book.	2002-09-29

I started it, then put it aside to finish at another time. I think Ms Feehan tired to do to much in the book. She introduces a lost Branch of Gregori's family, which has Julian's lifemate in it. She is a Carpathian female. Ancient and powerful in her own right. The group also includes her brother, Darius and several others ( including another female) that Darius saved when all in their village was killed. Desari is the first ancient female that Julian has encountered and he is not certain how to handle her. Darius is also extremely protective of the family unit and resents Julian. Part of the problem with this book is that to this point in the history of these people it has been that couples don't have children except hundred of years apart. Darius and Desari are very close in age, just years apart. Females have always been very fragile, hardly any survive past the first year. But Darius saves both, alone, as a teenager. Gregori doesn't seem to be impressed that Julian has found his lost brother and sister.	2002-09-03

She was a little to self-righteous.  I mean after the second time she reponse to a kiss from Edward you woudl she would get off her soap box.  This is the only real criticism I have of the book.  I liked Jeremy, he reminds me of my brother and nephew (probably boys in general).  I also like that Edward wasn't a so greedy as to take the title of himself.

Zenobia and Hawk's part of the story so very poignant.  She seems to care for Hawk alot.  She also recognized that Marcus was an attraction she could not ignore.

So they don't know all the things that have been happening since they were separated from the rest.  Therfore when Tempest (what a perfect name) arrives and Darius starts to see colors and feel emotion is torn between wanting to convert her and knowing that human females never survive the conversion.

Luc is afraid of allowing love to control his life, ie giving Amelia the power to control him through love.

Gideon acts like most men, not what most women would like men to act.  He is determine to consummate his marriage and get Sabrina to love him.  He very patient and understanding.  Sabrina is wary and untrusting throughout most of the book.  Which is one of few real complaints I have with this book.  She never seems to understand that Gideon is not like the other man in her life.  She is never emotionally strong enough to trust.  The other compliant I have is that the book does not resolve the issue of Gideon's wealth.	2002-08-22

When the two finally come together through the manuplations of her father the sparks fly. He resents her because he is being forced to marry her. She has been raised to love him and thinks that he is the most wonderful man in the world. I have since read several of Ms. London other books they are all wonderful.	2001-08-07

This is one of those books Lucien is so certain that Alexandra will fall to prey to his charms.  Although she is very attracted to him she resists.  As she gets to know him she realizes that he is not such a rogue beneath his public face.  They both have to overcome their painful past in order to be happy together.  The secondary characters add charm to the book.	2001-08-07

It is also the first of her books a read, I almost didn't read any others. The dialogue is forced and contrived. The love scenes are almost indifferant. I wanted to take the characters and slap them both. They are shallow and self center and hard to care about. Luckily I decided to give Ms. Johnson another chance and I have been very pleased with the other books I've read.	2001-07-24
