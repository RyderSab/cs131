And it is obvious that in that number of pages, to cover even half decently material going all the way from Homer Gilligan and Rorty is, in my humble opinion, not only impossible but also irresponsible. That is, unless the text was meant for high-school...Further, the Acknowledgments are, in view of the size of the book, somewhat pompous. When the authors write that...\\"Finally, we are grateful to our families for their constant and concrete expressions of support and encouragement\\" one is entitled to wonder if they believe they wrote a treatise of 1000 pages, that took them several years to bring to completion. And, for the live of me, where did they find out that the name \\"Aquinas\\" carries a written accent on the last 'a'? Aquins? I have checked with philosophers, historians, theologians and even Italians, and nobody would vouch for that version of the name. But they may know better than everybody else, unless they were merely trying to be original and different. <br />Aside from that, the book is readable in so far as it hardly skims the surface of the issues. The problem is that I bought it with a different expectation. Tough luck!	2004-09-22

This is a very good book. But it containswhat is, in my opinion, a fatal mistake that brings into question the entire credibility of the author. In page 83 of the paperback edition, it states  &quot;...the research of an Italian doctor, Cesare Lambrusco. This name, Lambrusco, is repeated two lines down and also in the Index. Mr. Bodenhamer had, I believe, Cesare Lombroso in mind, the founder of the so-called Criminal Anthropology, as anybody having taken intro criminology would tell you. The problem is that the mistake shows such sloppiness as to cast a negative shadow on every and all assertions of fact contained in the book. How can one know whether dates, names, constitutional cases, etc. are correctly identified? One cannot. If a student made such a mistake (and only that mistake) I would not hesitate in flunking him.	2002-07-25

For those of us who believe that American constitutional law is about the most exciting and stimulating intellectual game, this book is a must. Lewis does a marvelous job and succeeds in maintaining the reader's passionate attention. The bottom line is that the system works, some times late, but it certainly works. I am looking forward to reading Lewis' other book on constitutional history: &quot;Make no law&quot;, about the famous case of the New York Times in relation to the First Amendment.

Obviously, a lot of thought has gone into the selecting of the numerous reading. I've used it as companion to my course on sociology of law. It proved, however, a little too complex for undergraduates. I still believe it would be very useful for graduate courses, in particular the notes and questions accompanying the readings.  My main objection is the clearly leftist (or anarchical ?) bias the reader rather rapidly detects. I am not questioning the right of the editors to promote their point of view. But I believe their sympathies should have been stated to start with. Textbooks need not be neutral; their leanings, however, should not be hidden behind pretended scientific or academic objectivity. It is somewhat annoying to have to warn students. The above does not mean that I will never assign the book again. But it is my considered opinion that the higher level of critical ability of graduate students is more appropriate to confront the propaganda aspect of this text.	2000-11-02

However, it seems obvious its editors were not up to the task. Some articles are excellent (e.gr., Law and order in contemporary Japan, Ch. 6; Juvenile Delinquency in the Cross-Cultural Context, Ch.31), others are hardly worth the paper on which they are printed (e.gr., Low crime rates in Bahrain, Ch. 2; Organized crime in South Korea).  It seems the editors should have been more demanding instead of, apparently, simply accepting uncritically was was submitted to them.In addition, there are several factual mistakes that were not corrected. For instance,the Seventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention was held in 1985, not 1983 (pag. 17). And the Ninth Congress was held in Cairo, not in Tunis.This is nsot the exception, but rather the rule. So, the book is marred by poor editing. Too bad, because the material contained therein is of great importance.	2000-10-17

Simpson	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	A sensible, accesible and informative book	This book is clearly and sispassionately written. It is full of important  information on five crucial trials, and throws considerable light on the  strenghts and weaknesses of the American administration of justice. One  wishes the authors had included more cases. But, even as it is, it is a  good book to assign to courses of criminal justice at the undergraduate  level.  For me, the strongest of the five articles is the one ons the  Lindberghs' baby, in which the deleterious influence of unethical and  sensationalistic media is well highlighted. And the weakest the O.J.  Simpson case, perhaps because its proximity in time. The article on the  Scottsboro Trials is very helpful in understanding how the Supreme Court  has established precedents that are making justice for all more of a  reality in America. In any case, excellent reading, both for people  acquainted with the US criminal justice and for those who'd like to start  getting to know it.	2000-09-07

Simpson Case	Books	4	7	12	N	Y	Cool and controlled rage	This is required reading for anybody interested in understanding the circus around O.J. Simpson's trial, in particular for liberl whites who pretended to have felt betrayed. The essays hardly deal with questions of  guilt or innocence (although I got the feeling that most authors did  believe in O.J.'s guilt), but with the question of why the response was so  violent and bigoted, why white liberals accepted the trial by the media,  some even joining in the media lynching. Essays are somewhat uneven, but in  general very good and enlightening. Particularly striking were Kimberl  Williams Crenshaw and Ishmael Reed, the former elegant and poised, the  latter in cold rage. Disappointing (for me, of course) were Ann duCille  with her pre-digested Marxism, and Claudia Brodsky Lacour, who spoke more  of Kant than of OJ, with a Baroque and convoluted style, quite appropriate  for the Enlightment but hardly for the subject at hand. A question that  came to my mind was why white Liberals tend to believe that African  Americans should be forever grateful when a White Liberal treats them as  equal. And then, they feel betrayed when their white hands are not licked  in gratitude. After all, it is not a favor. Mind you, I happen to be what  is normally known as white.  In summary, excellent collection, to be highly  recommended to objective people trying to understand the bitterness of  African Americans in today's America	2000-07-28

The language is clear, the ideas well exposed, and the subject covered in a most satisfactory manner. The sixth edition I have read contains an extensive and very useful bibliography. I'd  recommend it whoheartedly for undergraduate courses on the topic. Some  minor criticisms: first, I would have liked the section on theoretical  perspectives to be more extensive, while the chapter on methods seems to me  to be superflous, at least for undergraduates. Second, at the bottom of  page 232, the information give is confusing. It talks about tons, without  specifying whether metric or not. Further, it uses ounces, pounds and  kilos, all very unclear. Thirdly, the sections on the socialist system are  obsolete, insofar as those systems have practically disappeared. And, yes,  although the author claims, at the bottom of p.1 that he has followed an  eclectic apporach, &quot;without embracing or advocating a particular  position, ideology, or theoretical stance&quot;, the truth is that I feel I  detect a very subtle but, nonetheless recognizable, &quot;leftish&quot;   leaning.

Its application of Durkheim's and Merton's anomie theory to the crime dynamics of American society is tightly reasoned and very appealing. The thesis that unusually high crime rates in  the US are the dark side of the success promoted by the American ethos  seems to account for many of the observed facts. The book follows an  excellent logical development and provides appealing explanations for the  etiology of the main American nightmare. Unfortunately, it lacks a truly  comparative perspective, since it practically ignores crime in the  underdeveloped countries. Compariong with Western Europe is hardly enough.  And the last ten pages, where the authors provide their recipe for  combatting crime, are, to say the least disappointing. By proposing actions  which are obviously non-viable, the authors transform their whole argument  into an interesting, even fascinating, but useless academic exercise. One  final point: The tendency of the authors to add &quot;political  correctness&quot; to citations is unforgivable. What an author said  anywhere between 150 and 80 years ago, should be cited as he/she wrote.  Thus, in page 105, the introduction of a  &quot;her&quot; in a citation of  Marx is unnecessary and smacks of opportunism. The same can be said of the  citation of James Truslow Adams in page 106, where the authors introduce a   &quot;and women&quot;. And before I forget, the table on page 103 places  Australia and New Zealand low in homicide but also low on decommodification  (monstruous word!), whereas Finland is higher in decommodification than the  UK, but also higher in homicide. Don't these contradictions fatally weaken  the argument of this chapter?	2000-07-01

The novel is full of common places and sentences that pretend to be poetic  and are merely corny. But I must admit that this terribly flawed novel is  very readable. The plot is certainly imaginative, though not terribly  credible. The actors lack any depth and are simply caricatures of human  beings.

In spite of its almost casual narrative style, the book is full of highly valuable insights into the theory and functioning of criminal justice administration. It also reveals some of the  corruption of the system which, even with the alleged best intentions,  destroys the essence of democracy. The cases of judicial arrogance and  arbitrariness revealed by Professor Dershowitz, are enough to give one the  creeps. How many defendants, who did not have the benefit of a true defense  of their interests, may be pining away in prison, victims of the connivance  of police, prosecutors and judges. Be that as it may, it is fascinating to  see a legal mind at work, and everything explained in a manner accesible to  lay people. I certainly hope the good Professor keeps on writing.

But, not being a lawyer, I was not quite sure my perceptions were accurate. When the verdict came in, I  felt vindicated. I was for acquittal, although I am white, whatever that  means. Reading Dershowitz' wonderful book gave me the Aha feeling almost  every other page. And it made me almost regret that decision I took more  than forty years ago to abandon the study of law and go for the social  sciences. It is terrific to see a first-class legal mind at work. The book  does not pretend to prove O.J.'s innocence, but it convincingly  demonstrates that the jury arrived at the correct decision.His logic is  impeccable and, as far as I am concerned, he accomplishes the task he set  out for himself. A masterful intellectual performance. On the other hand,  it is sad to see how prejudice and trial by the media could blind so many  people and led them to ignore the fundamental idea of the rule of law:  innocent until proven guilty, not to mention where the burden of proof  lies. It is also sad to see how American police officers could try to frame  somebody simply because of the color of his skin. History will eventual  tell, but Dershowitz' book will remain an all-important piece of the  historical puzzle. Kudos, Professor, I wish I had had the privilege of  being your student.	2000-05-22

Professor Clark writes a clear and highly informative review of the activities of the  Organization in this field since 1945. Having been a member of the then  Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch from 1982 to 1994, I was  active in the preparations for the 1985 and 1990 UN congresses on this  topic, and I am surprised at the enlightening manner Professor Clark has of  presenting a complex subject, making it accessible to the lay public. The  programme has produced over 40 instruments in the area of crime prevention  and criminal justice, which, although not binding in a legal manner,  establish moral obligations which a sizable number of countries are  unwilling to violate. They constitute the conceptual foundations upon which  one day a true international penal law become a reality. This book is the  best introduction to the largely unknown efforts of a group of dedicated  international civil servants and to the outcome of such efforts. I highly  recommend it to anybody who wishes to acquaint him-herself with this corpus  of legal thought and reflection.	2000-04-08

After reading and hating MacLuhan's  &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, I was hoping his disciple would straighten at least some of the intellectual abuses committed by his  master. Not so in the least. The disciple, still overwhelmed by the  friendship granted him when he was a young graduate student, by the great  guru, seems incapable of objective thinking. Is this a case of puppy love?  But, more concretely, I would like to know what is NOT a medium in this  bizarre quasi-religion of the digital. Even windows fall under this  category(Cf. p. 179: &quot;We invented windows...as an improvement upon the  poor choice of walls with no vision or walls with holes and no  warmth...&quot;). It is this pseudo-analysis that plagues this book, as  well as the books of the great white chief. And, if you happen to reject  all these facile generalizations, then you are a fool, or you haven't  understood the &quot;profundities&quot; in question. In the same way,  Marxists accuse their critics of suffering from false consciousness due to  their class origin, and Freudian affirm that the rejection is caused by  repressed emotions. One has to be a Marxist to understand Marx, and a  psychoanalyst to understand Freud. In the same way, only people who are  convinced of the truth in MacLuhan's all-explaining ideas to be able to  truly understand the genius. And when the author of the present books  affirms that &quot;Tom Wolfe...'aptly' compared (MacLuhan) to Darwin,  Einstein and Freud&quot;, the expression that comes to mind is &quot;Cult  of Personality&quot;.

The few pearls are buried  under such a mountain of bull that it is not worth the effor to search for  them. Mr. McLuhan pretends to know about everything, and shows he knows  absout nothing, with the possible exception of English literature.

She seems to have touched upon very sensitive spots in the American psyche, to the point where most reviewers seem to have lost any objetivity. Now, for somebody like myself, who had a certain facility for math, which was stifled by miserable teachers, and who however likes to think  &quot;mathematically&quot; (at a very elementry level), the book was a great assistance in obtaining an overall view of the importance and beauty of math. Granted, her politics are often all too obvious, and her insistence on feminist messages (for me, beating a dead horse) could be somewhat irritating. Referring to God as She is not merely silly; it is irrelevant and somehow self-celebrating. What is the point? All languages have built-in prejudices, which are mostly harmless. What is importance, in my opinion, is educational and employment opportunities, fair remuneration and equal chances for promotion. All the rest is unnecessary commentary. But, let it be. If she wants to call She the entire universe, that is her eminent right. We all have the right to be silly in some respects!	1998-06-08

Arabesques is one of the finest novels I have ever read. It is highly poetic prose and a magical exploration of childhood. The kinship thicket is sometimes difficult to unravel, but it provides  wonderful insights into Palestinian culture and its built-in conflicts.I highly reccomend it to fellow readers. I do certainly hope Shammas has written other novels since then, and, if so, I would like to see them translated.	1998-06-05

Poor exercise in populariz	The book is franly disappointing. Rather badly structured and almost boring at times. His explanations are often confusing and unclear. He should have included, among other things, a bibliography for those laymen who would like to continue exploring the topic.	1998-03-02

Simultaneously, you suffer because you are approaching the end, and wish it were to continue indefinitely. A great novel!	1998-01-19
