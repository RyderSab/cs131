The research put into this book is evident throughout with each example being thoroughly supported with data. The team highlights upfront that the reader may find reasons why some examples do not apply to them since the subset was so small. However, as you read through the pages, you will quickly discover that much more is applicable than you might suspect. Jim's care is also evident in making this a very readable and enjoyable book. The material is presented in ways that will make much of it memorable.	2003-09-04

The authors did a fantastic job summarizing what makes ideas work in an organization and the business model of business gurus. Their writing style was very readable, entertaining and enjoyable making this a good read that is easily recommendable. However, in chapter 8 they speak to close to their history and represent a view of knowledge management that may not be shared by all readers. One sentence highlighting that in a chapter that is otherwise represents their bias is not enough. Also, in chapter 9, the questions presented to an idea practictioner were leading. I will however find myself quoting the book so it is still a recommended read to broaden your thought leadership and success in pushing ideas forward. For the consultant make sure you complement this book with something that allows you to capture the client's view of value.	2003-09-02

The truth is not always popular, and grace is not always the right thing to provide.

I finally bought the paperback version and I was amazed at how wrong I was. EVERY Sentence in the book is important!  Tom Kosnik's quote on the cover is dead on. This book is worth the value of 12 books on sales in it takes every lesson learned in the field or taught in a book and presents it in a clear, logical and concise manner.

Seth did a great job stepping up the level of intellectualism in books on change and bringing many interrelated strategy concepts together. As a change agent that reads a lot of books on change I find that to often the subject is change management and there is only so much to be said on the subject. Seth clearly separates change as a vital part of business that is continuous and transformative versus something that is an event that must be managed. This book will provide you with some moments of genius, some moments that will challenge your thoughts, some moments you will disregard and some, moments you will find completely bizarre. But, that is the mark of vision and thought leadership. Nice job Seth! A recommended read for the change agents and the people we serve. Zoom!	2002-03-18

The other reviews are right, your hunger for God increases after reading this book. My theory is that this is because you are intrigued by all the paths it takes not because you were fed on any path. Choose what Mr. Yancey calls the one unique quality of Christianity, &quot;Grace&quot;. What's So Amazing about Grace, covers much of the same ground but feeds you a full helping of views on Grace. Again, both books are good, but Grace is superior.	2002-02-10

The meaning of what it is to be a man and the fights we have in our minds jump off the pages of this book. This book lived up to every raving review that drove me to read it in the first place.<br />It is for the Christian man and the non-believer in that it puts the voice of man first without condemnation.

Feelings are sometimes tough to quantify but the collection of opinions in Winning Angels should stand as a form of qualification. This book is great for helping to communicate the psychology of the investor to an entrepreneur frustrated with the fund raising process.	2001-06-28

This book is a quick and dirty enjoyable and informative readfor those completely in the dark about the venture experience. Itprovides a good fly bye feel of what the venture experience feels likeand what people might be looking for. The book is so readable it can be read in half a day. So Why not read it! The only objection I have heard to reading it is by people who receive most of the information from Steve's newsletter...  END	2000-04-19

This book is definitely not worth the read. It should be noted that it is written by an AT Kearney dude and as an ex-EDSer I can see the resemblance of the consultants that made all consultants look bad. It had no substance  but choose to use big words and complex evolved scenarios to provide the  pretence of intelligence. It is everything bad about a pompous consultant  roled into a book. Please note that the positive reviews of this book are  all from the Dallas / Fort Worth area which is home to the AT Kearney  legions. I gave it a 2 only because all reading is positive and it started  off good.	2000-04-09

It provides a good overview of competitive positioning if you are an entrepreneur or executive about to leap into e-business. Based upon the books popolarity I  expected more but I wasn't terribly disappointed. I enjoyed the authors  writing style and found it easy to skim back over to rejuvenate what I  learned from the initial read.	2000-04-09

This is a great audio tape, marvelously read from a well thought out book. Like many books that are designed to assist leaders in their development it states what we all should take as common sense but don't. It allows leaders  to adjust if possible and it allows team members to decide if they are  riding the right horse on their journey to success. I immediately ordered  the authors other works after listening to this tape. Great stuff!	2000-04-04

This book provided an ebusiness bend on things that many traditional business consultants already know (CRM, Supply Chain, ERP, Fulfillment, etc.) It contained a lot of detail information to the point of nausea. I  would not recommend this to the well read or well educated executive. It  would be a good introduction if you are just trying to get a broad view of  how big ecommerce projects can get.	2000-04-04

Books	2	16	28	N	N	Marketers are not sales people	Although Mr. Sugarman can be funny at times in his writing his blatant self marketing overshadows the humor. Also as a sales person who has done a lot of marketing, I can say that marketers are not sales people. In fact  this book encourages the mistakes made by many young companies of buying  into a marketer's hype and believing that they can increase sales. This is  only true on simple products like sunglasses. If you sell high tech or  solutions pass on this book. It is all about how to trick the customer  which is not how deals are closed.	1999-12-28
