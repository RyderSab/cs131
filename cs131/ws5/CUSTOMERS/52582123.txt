I suggest very large blocks of salt, in fact.<br />The book does, indeed, cover the Wiccan Rede couplet by couplet.  The author fails to credit its first publication by Lady Gwen Thompson, which makes me highly suspicious of his scholarship.  One might get the opinion from his book that its history was completely unknown.<br />The veiwpoints of how to interpret the Wiccan Rede are his own, and do not reflect the views of most of the Wiccans I have met, from eclectic or Traditional backgrounds.  In particular his personal stance on homosexuality sounds much more like what I expect from conservative Christianity than from a Wiccan.<br />His personal webpage certainly does more to explain his views than I can, and I suggest you read it before buying any of his books...	2003-11-12

I ordered it to have some \\"cute\\" decks for the people who like cute, and becauase I really like Dorothy Morrison, the author.  Some of the Tarot readers on staff figured they would use it for fairs and for children, but not for serious readings.<br />We were wrong.  The deck captivated all of us at the store, including me.. and I *despise* most cute decks.  The pictures are drawn from fairy tales, some of which are well known, others less so, so getting the book (or the set) is a good idea,  but even without the book it is very readable.  The pictures hit you at a subconscious level, very strongly.<br />The artist is Mary Hanson Roberts, the author of the Hanson Roberts deck, which I knew to be excellent (and I recomend).  If you like the art style of the Hanson Roberts deck, you will likely appreciate the art in this deck.  The author of this deck is Dorothy Morrison, who has written extensively on Pagan topics.  The deck is ,however, quite able to stand on its own without the prior acheivements of the author and artist.<br />Yes, the cards are somewhat softened. The tower, death, etc have all been re-done in a more approachable style.  My professional readers all agree they are less likely to frighten a first time or skittish querant, while being just as readable.  The one problem with using this deck is that many people simply wont take it as seriously.<br />The Magician is \\"Puss in Boots\\" and instantly understandable to anyone who has read that fable.  When you  draw this card you know you are dealing with someone who lives by their wits, and parleys their natural talents into extraordinary  and often magical feats, but is a trickster, and bears watching. A valued ally, and a dangerous opponant.<br />The one card I might argue with is \\"Temperance\\", here depicted as \\"Jack and Jill\\". The picture shows Jack and Jill tumbled down the hill, with the water buckets spilling and overturned, through lack of wisdom and restraint.  It simply doesnt read the same way as I expect Temperance to read from the Rider Waite deck.  It is a valid and understandable reading, but not the same.<br />The best way to get a feel for any Tarot deck is to actually see it, and handle it, of course, but I do strongly recomend this deck for personal readings, and for proffessionals, with the caveat about not being taken seriously by some querants.ck of wisdom and restraint.

If you are looking for inspirational reading, or a book to help you in your Rosary devotions, I suggest you try Caryll Houselander's \\"The Essential Rosary\\" instead.<br />\\"Stories of the Rose\\" discusses various possible ancestors of the modern Rosary, as well as having amptly documented references to early writings about the Rosary.  Included in this book is a wide ranging discussion of the reasons why the Rosary gained in poularity at specific times in history.<br />A well documented book, especially on the politics and religious upheavals that surrounded the development of the Rosary, it is none the less a bit on the dry side, and would have benefitted from a better narrative format.  It can be difficult to follow unless you are passingly familiar with Catholic Church history.<br />Recommended especially for those with an interest in history, or for those re-enactors who might really want to know what form of prayer beads were in use in the 15th century.	2002-04-04

A wide ranging course of study on the basics of the Amber trade and a comprehensive scientific primer on the nature of Amber, are a wonderful bonus.<br />The book also includes several methods for determining if what you have is real or synthetic Amber, as well as a solid discussion of the various types of fakes that are on the market, and how to spot them.<br />I sell Amber and Jet, both of which are fossil \\"gemstones\\" and I always recommend this book to my customers. A well informed customer is the best way to keep honest merchants in business, since they are unlikely to pass up quality work in favor of the \\"bargain\\" that is really a fake.<br />I recomend the book \\"Jet Jewelry and Ornaments\\" by Helen Muller for a similar overview on Jet.

Helen Muller covers mostly antique Jet, of course, but also covers the imitations that were popular at the height of Jet fashion.<br />In one small book you learn a *lot* about genuine Jet, and you also learn the one thing I have had to explain more times than I care to recall: Just beause it is antique doesn't mean it is genuine Jet!  Jet was imitated as soon as it became popular, and many of the antiques (and valuable in their own right as antiques) are not genuine Jet.  This book explains what many of the imitations were, and how to determine if it is Jet, or imitation.<br />Absolutely gorgeous pictures of carved Jet, and imitation Jet jewelry, with a lot of interesting facts about the Whitby England Jet carving center.<br />A must have addition to the library of antique jewelry colectors, flea market merchants, and re-enactors.  This book is *required reading* for anyone looking to purchase genuine Jet for ritual purposes as well.	2002-04-04

It is after that that this book differs from most of the other small Rosary guides.  Each Mystery is introduced with an appropriate Biblical passage (The Annunciation is introduced by Luke 1:35) and closed with a prayer by Caryll Houselander that reflects the nature and spirit of that Mystery.<br />A fine way to enrich your study of the Rosary, or to add more thoughts and meditations on the Holy Mysteries.  If you want to deepen your spiritual approach to the Rosary, this book will be a loved addition to your library.  The book is small enough to be included in almost anyone's luggage, or even in a large pocket, bag, or purse, and can therefore be taken along as a pocket resource on the Rosary and the relevent Biblical passages.  Since I occasionally make gemstone Rosaries, I am often asked to recommend a book, and have found this book to be an excellent accompaniment to the gift of a Rosary.<br />If you are looking for more information about the history of the Rosary instead, then I suggest \\"Stories of the Rose\\" or any of the other fine books on the Rosary's history and practice, as this small book does not cover historical practice.	2002-04-03

Many people see the word &quot;perfumes&quot; and, figuring that they don't need a whole book on perfume, pass this book by.  This is unfortunate, as this book is one of the treasures in my library!  I cannot recommend this book highly enough, even if you are downright allergic to perfume!<br />The book does cover perfume, and is a valuable reference on perfumes in all their uses, BUT it is not only about perfume.  This book is one of the best primers on Kabbalistic thought, the tree of life, and ritual magic that a beginner (or advanced) student could hope for.  The first few chapters are a basic primer on kabbalistic theory that is seldom equalled in clarity and usefullness, including a very clear example of the middle pillar excersize.  The next chapters focus on perfume and incense blending, both for pleasing scents and for magical use.<br />For the herbal students the middle of the book is the most rewarding.  Every point or path on the tree of life is associated with a perfume/incense/scent. Each plant or animal source of that scent is discussed in detail. (Including synthetic, cruelty free, alternatives to the traditional musk and other animal scents)  The entry on Olibanum, Frankincense, begins on page 59 and takes three pages, covering history, trade, uses, value, botony, and blending scents. Since every card in a Tarot deck corresponds with a sphere or path on the tree of life, it is also a useful addition to Tarot meditations.<br />Towards the end of the book, as a delightful bonus, all the planetary rulers and influences, and their typical correspondances and God-forms, are discussed.<br />This book is a MUST HAVE for any ritual magician, any student of incense or perfume,and anyone studying Kabbalah.  I consider it a valuable addition to the library of anyone interested in magic, aromatherapy, or incense making.  I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the history and trade of incense and perfume, which makes this a perfect gift for anyone in one of the historical re-enactment groups.e of the historical re-enactment groups.	2000-12-05

There are diagrams of the active chemical compounds, when known, and lots of details about growth and habitat, but the directions and hazards of use are clear enough for a novice.<br />While not covering the more common herbs, such as Rosemary, or sage, this book is a valued part of my herbal library.  I sincerely hope that the author writes a more wide ranging book on herbs in the future!  Definately worth every penny.	2000-12-05

There are people who collect Tarot decks for the artwork, and people who only buy decks to use.  I tend to do both, and have a colection of over 30 decks.  The Robin Wood Tarot is one of the few in my collection that is both admired for its artwork, and in regular use as a reading deck.<br />This deck is overtly Pagan, and will probably not suit anyone who likes Christian imagery in their deck.  All of the images are close enough to the &quot;standard&quot; of the Rider-Waite Tarot, to be read without difficulty for anyone familiar with that deck.  This deck uses swords=air, wands=fire symbology.<br />The best book on tarot reading in general to go with the deck is &quot;Tarot, Plain and Simple&quot;, which uses illustrations from this deck.  Robin Wood's own book, &quot;The Robin Wood Tarot, The Book&quot; is a better choice for finding out the details behind why certain cards are depicted the way they are, and is very interesting reading in its own right, but is not as clear on basic divinatory meanings, or basic Tarot reading.<br />Some of the notable card imagery in this deck:<br />The Magician:  The Magician is depicted as a Wiccan High Priest, wearing a crown of antlers, but still wearing the  traditional red and white and with all the familiar symbology.<br />The High Priestess:  Unquestionably a Wiccan priestess, with her Dianic crown and pentacle necklace, she is depicted in a familiar way, with much the same symbols as would be expected, but outdoors.<br />The Heirophant:  Robin Wood's disatisfaction with organized religion shows clearly in this card (for more details, please read her book) and is unusually negatively aspected.<br />All of the minor arcana are fully illustrated, and very clear.  Note to the modest, there is some realistically depicted nudity in this deck, although very tasteful.<br />No one deck will ever suit all people.  The deck that speaks to you, may not speak to me and vice versa.  I can only say that I have found it of use *to ME* as a good deck to read from, and hope you find it likewise.<br />If you like Robin Woods artwork, then this deck is worth collecting for the art alone, and I can also highly recomend going to her website, to see and buy more of her prints.  She now offers machine embroidery patterns, as well as doing a great deal of work on computer graphics, and fonts, and sells disks of these ready to use.<br />Blessings and Peaces a good deck to read from, and hope you find it likewise.<br />If you like Robin Woods artwork, then this deck is worth collecting for the art alone, and I can also highly recomend going to her website, to see and buy more of her prints.

It is easy to read.  It doesn't weigh more than my bookshelf.  It is written from a Wiccan standpoint, not dependent on Christian or Jewish religious knowledge.  (Did I mention that I can carry it in a backpack, without a luggage cart?)<br />This is the book I usually recommend to Pagans who are trying to undertake the study of the Tree of Life.  Most books on Qabalah (also spelled Kabbala, Quabala, and many other variants) are written from an explicitly Jewish or Christian perspective, which may be difficult to follow for those not especially knowledgable in that faith.  In addition, books on Qabalah which do not account for reincarnation, or other tenets of many Pagan faiths, may prove hard to apply for Pagans.  Since this book is written from a Pagan/Wiccan perspective, it is much easier to apply and interprete for most Pagans (in fact for anyone not of the Jewish or Christian religions).  Christians and Jews who wish to study Qabalah will also find this book useful, but generally have more books on Qabalah that are written from the perspective of their religion, and may wish to have at least one of those in addition.<br />Knowledge of Qabalah can be very useful in crafting better rituals, allowing you to have a different perspective on energy or healing work, understanding paths and patterns within your life, and working with the Tarot.<br />This book is actually one of the set of Ellen Cannon Reed's works on Qabalah and Tarot, although it does stand on its own.  In order to get a complete picture,and a better understanding of Qabalah I do suggest buying all three items in the set:  This book, &quot;The Witches Qabala&quot;, her other book, &quot;The Witches Tarot&quot;, and the Tarot deck  &quot;The Witches Tarot&quot;.<br />The actual Tarot deck is a useful addition, but for those who are mostly interested in the study of Qabala, you may wish to start with this book, add &quot;the Witches Tarot&quot; book after this one, and decide if you want the deck later.  The Tarot book *does* add to your understanding of the Qabalah, and should be considered part of the set, according to the author. ....h to start with this book, add &quot;the Witches Tarot&quot; book after this one, and decide if you want the deck later.

This is not the book I would recommend for a basic &quot;what is Tarot?&quot; or &quot;how do I do a reading?&quot; overview. For a basic Tarot primer I recommend the book &quot;Tarot, Plain and Simple&quot;, which also uses illustrations from the Robin Wood Tarot.<br />This book discusses the details of *WHEN this card was designed, *WHY this image is depicted in this exact way, and *IF I could I would work in another hint to go buy Robin Wood's excellent ethics worksbook &quot;When, Why, If...&quot; but I digress...<br />If you want specific details on why the clothing is that color, on why the cup is held just so, and the symbology of every detail in the Robin Wood Tarot, you have the right book!  An extraordinary look into the artists mind  and the stories behind the artwork, as well as a very advanced discussion of the symbology in ALL Tarot decks.  Reading this book gave me insights into the small often overlooked symbols that were part of the &quot;teaching vocabulary&quot; of all Tarot cards.<br />Tarot decks were always designed to be teaching tools, in the same way that the stained glass windows of the Catholic cathedrals were &quot;picture books&quot; of the teachings of the Catholic church, for those who could not read.  The Tarot has always included the lessons of the mysteries, and the occult studies, that were forced underground and into secrecy.  Robin Wood took up this tradition in the Tarot, and has added many subtle Pagan teaching points to the illustrations in the Robin Wood deck.  Consider this book to be the teacher's guide to those hidden symbols, and the deck to be the study book.<br />This is a *required* book if you wish to use the Robin Wood deck as a teaching tool, and I could also highly recommend it (even by itself) to those trying to homeschool or teach about paganism.  I also strongly suggest it if you like &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stories from the artist.	2000-11-08

I wrote a very quick review for this product, ages ago, and felt that I needed to better describe this book.<br />When selecting a blank book for your writings that is intended to be kept for many years, perhaps even passed down to future generations, then quality must be your first consideration.  This is a solidly bound, unlined, blank book with thick enough pages not to have your ink bleed through.  It is a black book, available in two sizes, labeled in Gold embossed letters on the cover, and down the spine, &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;.  It includes a small paper insert with a suggested book blessing and dedication.<br />The pages are acid free and of archival quality, which means they will not redily turn yellow or become brittle.  You may wish to consider that you must use a long lasting, non fading ink, if you expect any of your writings to last.  Since the pages are unlined, you may embellish freely with pictures, drawings, diagrams, rubber stamps, or whatever you desire.  For more information on making books and memories last, I suggest reading a good sourcebook on scrapbooking.<br />This is a bound book, like any &quot;hardback book&quot;, and you will not be able to change the order of your pages, or add material between pages one and two, so careful consideration of how you want your book arranged should be done *before* you fill any of it in.<br />My personal &quot;working&quot; Book(s)of Shadow(s) tend to be kept in three ring binders, as I am often adding new information, or arranging things differently.  I *do* use a copy of this book however, for the core teachings, basic rituals, and liturgy that I often use when teaching others.  It has stood up to hard use, and still looks very elegant.	2000-11-07

The author makes many claims without listing any source material, and I could certainly wish for more information on some of her historical statements (&quot;women invented...&quot;) but I fortunately did not buy the book as a history reference for civilization.<br />This book is a useful reference for Dianic, or feminyst Wicca.  It nicely summarizes the (less extreme) views of Dianic Wicca, concentrating on the Goddess alone, but without neccesarily denigrating the male principle (or reader).  It covers the history of the Dianic/feminyst Wicca movement, and introduces the reader to many of the primary writers and philosophies that form the core of these beliefs.<br />The rituals are moving, with real grace and power, and the entire book is clear and well written.  The information is presented clearly to the beginner, without looking down on the more experienced practicioner.  Her poetry is beautiful, and even if you prefer a more balanced or dualistic approach to Wicca, you will find much of value and use in this book.  If you find yourself drawn to the Goddess, rather than to the God, you will find most of these rituals ready for your use; if not I still think that much of the poetry and power of the rituals can be used in a more gender balanced form.	2000-11-07

What it *is* is a book of coven dynamics, psychology, and all the other messy parts of running and being in a coven, that you hope you will never deal with, but you will.<br />Judy Harrow has a background in psychology and human relationships, and that is the main focus of the book.  It covers a great deal that will be needed by anyone working in a group with the strong personal ties that any religious and work group will form.<br />Most of this book covers how to deal with loss, with growth, what kind of parent/child or teacher/student relationships may form, and how to deal with them.  In addition it covers some magical and practical matters such as: picking the right kind of group for you, finding a working method you can work with, and the drawbacks and advantages of different styles of leadership.  The sections on dealing with the coven member's problems, the press, the public, the prima donna, and other chronic issues, will be useful to any member of any coven.<br />The book is drawn mostly from the personal experiences of the author, with comentary on &quot;how to handle problems&quot; and &quot;what happened to me&quot; from several other coven leaders and elders.  Many times the disagreements of these sources about how to handle particular problems, what to teach in what order, etc. is just as informative as when they agree.  Many of them contributed ritual, prayers, and other liturgy which are scattered through the book.<br />I would suggest this book as an *addition* to Amber K's book &quot;Covencraft&quot;, which I recommend for more of the 'nuts and bolts' of forming a coven or working group, and which I consider a required book to read before trying to form a coven.  These two books together would form a very useful set of books on any coven leaders shelf.<br />In the interest of fairness, I must state that I know a few of the pagan leaders quoted in this book, and consider several of them to be close friends; I have tried not to let this bias my recommendation of the book.ss, I must state that I know a few of the pagan leaders quoted in this book, and consider several of them to be close friends; I have tried not to let this bias my recommendation of the book.	2000-11-07

This book covers the basics of finding people, deciding if you can work with them, establishing a study group, and finally establishing a coven.  It then goes on to cover some of the most common logistical issues any coven will face.<br />The book is practical, and thorough.  From how to write the flyer to put up on a bulliten board, to how to interview prospective coveners, and beyond, the book will take you through the arduous task of finding people to practice, work, and worship with.  This is not a small book, it is one of the larger and weightier books in my library, but it covers a great deal.<br />This is not a &quot;basic Wicca&quot; book. It does not cover the rudiments of the beliefs, the &quot;why&quot; of the religion.  This book covers, and covers very well,the mechanics and logistics, the &quot;how&quot; of the religion.  Of course it reflects some of the authors bias on how the coven should be set up, the heirarchy of the coven and so on, but these can be easily re-worked to suit a group with differing beliefs.<br />While the entire focus of the book is on covens and groups, it has been of value to me and many others who have practiced as solitaries, which most of us do at some point.	2000-11-07

If you are looking for an overview guide to pagan beliefs about Yule, then you will also appreciate this book.  If you are looking for an indepth analysis of the transition from Pagan to Christian holiday celebrations, with full documentation on terms, names, and custom in the early church.. then you need a different book, because this one isnt it.<br />No one book can be all things to all people about a specific subject.

It has been added to, and expanded, for publication, and should prove very useful  to the new, or advanced, student.  None of the secrets of the Gardnerian  tradition are revealed, and this book can stand as a tradition in its own  right (and has, many eclectic groups started with this book).<br />The  training excersizes are very good, and it does an excellent job of teaching  students how to avoid the common energy working pitfalls.  If the suggested  training regimen is followed then the student will develop an admirable  level of both discipline and control.<br />If you are looking for a simple  spellbook, then this is NOT the book for you.  Likewise, if you are not  interested in a disciplined approach to magic, or in magical/psychic  excersizes which require practice, then your money is better spent  elsewhere.  If, however, you find clearly written and organized structure  and excersizes useful, then you will be very pleased with this book.<br />The  structure and discipline should be able to be incorporated into anyone's  practice.	2000-01-02
US	52582123	R3E26WPDWEY3Z7	157353109X	512331579	The Spell of Making	Books	5	8	9	N	N	in depth ritual construction and theory	an ambitious beginner might enjoy this book, but it is certainly not a &quot;light read&quot;.  If you are going to write rituals, for yourself or a group, this is an essential reference.  I picked it up by mistake,  thinking it was about ritual tools, and quickly realized that I needed this  book!  Blacksun gives clear details on the many aspects involved in  creating a ritual, from magical intent, to symbology and drama. What to  include, and how to decide, is only one of many ritual construction steps  he explains.  There are a few rituals included that are completely  explained, including why each decision was made.  Even though the book is  written from a Wiccan perspective, the book would be usefull to almost any  religion since ritual is an integral part of all faiths.	1999-12-28

Everyday Magic is about just that.. the magic we need everyday.  I don't know any other author who has published a spell to improve modem speed!  Many people will undoubtadly go straight to the grimoire in back, but they  will miss some of the gems in the first half of the book, including a  version of the old standby &quot;an it harm none&quot; spell rider that  works much better than any other version I've seen.  Definately worth  adding to your reference library!	1999-12-27

I would recomend this deck to Wiccans and Pagans  primarily, but also to anyone who collects or likes a variety of artwork.	1999-07-27

(isis worship was  imported as far north as ireland and germany with traders and raiders)  even if you are not interested in egypt or egyptian religion you will find  the ideas and rituals moving and useful.  if you do have any interest in  isis, you simply must get this book.	1999-05-24

(and isn't that the way wicca works : ) )	1999-05-03
