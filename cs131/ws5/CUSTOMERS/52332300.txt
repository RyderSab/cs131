Books	5	13	16	N	N	An excellent presentation of a fascinating subject	This is the best book I've seen on the subject to date, as it builds the theory ground up - the text is analyzed in detail and presented in it's historical context, which makes a clear presentation.<br /><br />This helped me put all the parts in a greater context - not only Jewish context, but that in which the Jews of the time lived in as well. This context gave me a greater understanding of the text - the rational & motivation answer a 'why' type questions that make it easier to answer 'what does it say' questions. As a previous reviewer wrote, understanding the rational allows to accept and live with the text better than literalist explanation away contradictions - which causes many people to reject the whole text.<br /><br />The book brings to the reader's notice details which are easy to miss and that enrich the experience of reading and understanding the bible - style differences, historical and geographical context, motivation, etc.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anybody interested in the bible - it adds depth and richness to it's understanding to all, and would give another clearly and well presented point of view to those who would reject it.	2005-02-17

Than he does not name any of the books. Even when he writes about finding a second hand book that held the information about the last few names, he does not mention it's name.    I find this hard to accept for two reasons.    The first is that the literal meaning of the word Kabbalah in Hebrew is 'reception' - the wisdom of Kabbalah is to be passed in an unbroken chain, with one's own understanding being far less important. Thus in Kabbalah not listing your sources is not just dishonest [as in not crediting others' work] but is breaking the rules of the very system Berg is teaching.    The second is that there are at least two books that cover the powers / meanings of all the names.    One is Sepher Razi'el haMal'ach (book of the angel Razi'el), which is very well known and contains three such lists. As hard as those are to understand, they still exist, still well known, and should be understandable to someone who is an expert in Kabbalah.    The second is Shorshey haShemot (the roots of names), an encyclopedia of angel & G-d names with various manuscripts, the largest and most prestigious of them attributed to Rav Moshe Zaccuto. This book was published in Hebrew at least five years ago, and I've seen parts of it translated to English about two years ago.    Either Berg is unaware of those two books, or he chose to not give them credit. Both cases sound suspicious to me.	2004-10-27

As far as content goes, both books are rather trivial - basic card meanings, a few spreads with examples, and a list of about a 100 tips (a tip being the meaning of combination of cards).      There are other books, such as Joan Bunning's \\"Learning the Tarot: A Tarot Book for Beginners\\" that has an accompanying web site, which do a much better job for a similar price, so I can recommend buying this book only if it's much cheaper than books like those I mentioned earlier in the review.	2004-08-03

This is an excellent introduction to the subject of Judaism and magic & superstition.    It covers broad territory - powers of good & evil, demons, holy names, medicine, amulets, divination, dreams, and more - and supplies an extensive bibliography for those interested to continue studying any of the subjects in the book.    What I didn't find in the book is details or flesh - the book has a lot of breadth, but just scratches the surface on each of the subjects. Also, the book gives details about the customs of German Jews at specific centuries, but rarely mentions customs of, say, Jews from Islamic countries.    So if you're looking for an introduction, this is the book for you. If you're looking for depth, I suggest books such as Aryeh Kaplan's.	2004-07-28

This book is an excellent *hermetic* cabala encyclopedia - it is thorough, bringing together most of the information one would see in it, e.g. various attributions a-la Crowley's Liber 777 covering subjects such as the 72 fold name of god, the 42 letters name of god, seals, spirits, tarot, etc.<br />The book contains three major sections - the first is the encyclopedia itself in English alphabetical order, the second a Hebrew-English dictionary, and the third a gematric index which brings various Hebrew words by their gematric value.<br />There is a good bibliography, a reproduction of Crowley's Sepher Sephiroth, and a couple of interesting appendixes.<br />The major problem I see with this book is enormous number of errors in Hebrew - it looks like neither the author not any of Llewellyn's staff working on the book know any Hebrew. This includes not only spelling errors (which lead to errors in the gematria calculations, which means one should double check *all* Hebrew spelling and gematria calculations in this book with a good English-Hebrew dictionary), but also errors in basic material, e.g. none of the spellings of the 42 letters name of God brought in the book is correct.<br />So, indeed, one can benefit a lot from learning the correspondences and their logic, but still needs to cast doubts about what's written in the book and research for her/himself.<br />A secondary problem is with images - those are valueable, but many of them look pixelized, as if they were scanned at low resolution and enlarged.<br />And to repeat my emphasis from the first paragraph - this is a book about *hermetic* cabala, and *not* Jewish cabala. Jewish Cabala uses a different version of the tree of life (described in appendix C of this book), different attributions, etc.	2004-03-27

I think it makes for better focus on the larger issues of privacy, security, e-commerce, etc.<br />For the gory details, one can read books such as Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography.<br />My only problem with the book is that it is somewhat biased against the U.S. government's position.	2003-11-06

Having seen a few Whare Ra pips, which lack the astrological signs, possibly this divergence has some basis in previous G.D. decks.<br /><br />------ Additional note, July 7th 2011 ------<br /><br />Some of the court cards in this deck face forward. The Opening of the Key requires all court cards to face, even slightly, either left or right.<br /><br />The court cards reproduced from Westcott's papers in The Golden Dawn Court Cards (Golden Dawn Studies No 5) by Darcy Kuntz conform to that demand, e.g. the princess of cups faces slightly to the right as indicated by the contour of her face and only the left ear being visible. Those drawings are in agreements with those given in \\"Key to Tarot divination\\", AFAIK written by Westcott as well (there are two notes signed S.A. - Sapere Aude was Westcott's moto).<br /><br />I hope future editions of the deck would correct this issue.	2002-10-21

The book is very readable - I finished it in one day, and rather enjoyed it. The material is mostly gossipy, which makes for easy and fun reading.<br />The book's gossipy character makes it somewhat shallow.<br />Each chapter centers around one major character. This way the events' time line is hidden, and many events are mentioned several times in different chapters.<br />As the book tells more about the events than the people themselves, I think breaking the material by person only confuses the book needlessly.<br />I recommend this book for people who are interested in the people behind the order, and not in the order history or order materials.	2002-05-30

The minor arcana cards get only a few keywords to each card's meaning.<br />This makes the bulk of the book simply a cheat sheet - a list of keywords that help remember the cards' meaning, with no in-depth explanations.<br />There are a few pages explaining four standard spreads, e.g. celtic cross, with no examples of interpreted spreads. Again, this is good as a cheat sheet and nothing else - an experienced reader doesnt need it, and a beginner would need a few examples.<br />If you want a cheat sheet, I think you can find good cheat sheets for free on the Internet.

I can see how the name of the book would mislead the buyers of this book in this way.<br />As a book about the history of math, I think it is a very good book - it covers the time span from the greeks to the modern era, focusing on western civilization (e.g. the far and middle east are mentioned very little), with chapters about the heavy weight mathematicians of the time. The author makes his opinions clearly and at some length, and I think he got quite a few good points.<br />The math is a bit difficult for a popular science book, and I get the impression the author just threw in a bit of math just as illustrations to main theme of the history of math and not in order to give the reader some insights and in-depth understanding.<br />So, if you want a book about the history of math in the west with the author's opinions and commentary, I recommend this book to you. But if you want a book about Pi, by all means skip this book.	2002-05-02

Only the basics are presented, which might satisfy many readers, but left me wanting for more. I wish the author would have taken Simon Singh's approach of including the basics in the main part of the book and expanding on them in appendice - this way those not mathematically inclined can skip the math without loosing anything while those who are can be satisfied as well.<br />The book gives very little material on the Kabbalah. The tree of life, a major concept which serves as a bridge between the infinite and the finite, is hardly mentioned. The concepts of the Ein and the Ein Sof seem to be discussed just so as to give some colour to the book, and arent really discussed in depth.<br />All in all, this isnt a bad book - it just calls for a second expanded version.	2002-03-06

This book is a masterpiece - it's very informative &amp; researched (which make it contrast sharply with the many - too many - shallow formulative books published nowadays), and gives a wide and deep view of the tarot.<br />Wang explains the tarot using the Qabala (especially the tree of life) and some astrology, based on the Golden Dawn tradition, giving it a context and underpinning - the tarot is presented not as a collection of pictures, but as the structured tool that has a structure and ordered basis in western occult tradition. To illustrate his explanation, he compares the Tarot of Marseilles, his own Golden Dawn deck, Waite's Rider deck, and Crowley's Thoth deck. The book can be used as a guide for all of those decks, or as the best companion guide to the books that accompany them (e.g. the Pictorial Key to the Tarot or Book of Thoth).<br />Though the book is not the easiest to read (and needs to be read more than once to be fully digested), the language is concise, the structure of material logical and clear, and is worth every cent of its price and every moment spent reading.<br />The only complaint I have about this book is the poor binding - the pages are poorly glued at the back which made the pages break into four groups quickly.

I think those detours put the plot in context - the attempts to find a proof were not made in a vacuum, were not done in a linear fashion, nor were they made by robots.

The introduction is much more solid that than of most beginners' books nowadays.<br />Chapter II covers the major arcana in the standard &quot;Tarot 101&quot; format - two pages per card, one with the card's picture and another with a description of the card, the card's meaninig when straight, and the card's meaning when upside down. The meanings are mainly keywords, which I think are not terribly accurate but are good enough for beginners.<br />Chapter III explains how to spread the cards using the Celtic Cross.<br />Chapter IV covers the minor arcana. Court cards are explained in the same format as the major arcana, while the numbered cards are given 5-6 lines each with just meanings. Again, the meanings are mostly keywords.<br />Chapter V explains several other spreads - a seven cards past/present/future spread, a complex name based spread, three overcomplicated, badly explained, and rather useless spreads (56 cards horseshoe, 54 cards royal, and 7th card), and a nice Gypsy spread.<br />A bibliography is included, which I think is of little use - it includes this book itself, along with several other books without a hint regarding which material was taken from which book and why.<br />This is an average beginner's book - it covers the basic needed material needed in a good fashion, but doesnt do a great job of it.	2001-03-20

This is supposedly supported by archeological findings, to which no references are given in the booklet.<br />The &quot;Us = opressed multicultural womyn Vs. Them = evil white men&quot; is shown in various places :<br />* The Son of Sword is a white man and a greedy murderer.<br />* The Emperor card is described in the booklet thus :<br />&quot;symbolyzing dominion and dictatorship, the Emperor is the sky god, the boss, the patriarch using the intellect to accomplish his goals and force to carry out his demands. He represents the dangers of unrestrained power and private ownership : Zeus the angry thunder god and jehovah the jealus father.&quot;<br />Has the emperor *no* positive sides ?<br />* The Hierophant card features evil men enslaving women. A friendly coloured man as Shaman could have been portrayed instead, and the choice tells something about the creators' intentions.<br />* The devil is a white man enslaving women and coloured men.<br />* The Sun card features a black man and women of all colours, but not a white man.<br />* The World card feautres several women, but not a single man.<br />As a white man who was raised in a Judaistic culture but is not anything like the Emperor, Hierophant, or Devil of this deck I find this deck objectionable, a good example of feminism in it's worst, and I will not - indeed can not - use it.<br />The booklet has a few introductory pages with the feministic tones I mention above, meanings for each card, a short sectionon numerology, and an original spread.<br />The cards are of good quality material, but a bit hard to shuffle, possibly due to their shape.<br />Though the earth tones make some of the cards look a little dead, the art is colourful, beautiful, and original - it's unlike any other deck I've seen.<br />I would have liked the deck a lot, if not for it's anti white men attitude.	2001-03-12

The booklet includes a 6 cards spread, and a traditional keywords list for each card.<br />The booklet says nothing about the art, and I have very little knowledge about ancient Egyptian culture, so I cant tell whether the art is just beutiful or has some depth and authenticity behind it (e.g. whether the hieroglyphs have meanings or whether the persons on the cards are taken from appropriate myths).<br />The cards show influences from the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, e.g. in the 5 of Wands and 6 of Swords cards, though Justice and Strength are ordered the traditional way, rather than Waite's way.<br />All in all, this is a very artistic &amp; beutiful deck, though a bit expensive.	2001-02-25

When I just started working as a programmer, I came across the 2nd edition international student reprint of this book, in red softcover, at a students' bookshop, and bought it. I treasure that copy in my library to this day - it gave me a solid background in computer networking that served me well in the past and is an asset that will serve me in the future.<br />Previous reviews have mentioned Tanenbaum's excellent and concise writing style and the breadth of the material covered, which are two of the good qualities that made this book a classic.<br />What wasnt mentioned and I consider important is :<br />- The bottom up explanation of networking, starting with the physical layer, up through the OSI layers (link layer, network layer, transport layer) to the application layer. This structure makes it very clear how networks work, how they are designed, and why.<br />- The well made balance between broad coverage of topics and the depth of coverage of each topic. After reading this book it's easy to start studying in depth any subtopic covered in this book (e.g. TCP/IP through Comers' books) as the reader knows how the subtopic fits in the big picture and knows enough to make a smooth start.<br />Some previous reviewers asked about solutions to problem, so I'll note that this book does have booklet with problem solutions, which is apparently made available only to academical staff [ and people mistaken to be such :-) ].<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any type of network related job, students who study networking, and anyone who wants to study computer networking.	2001-02-05

This book is a concise introduction to one of the most influential tarot decks of our time, namely the Golden Dawn deck drawn by the Mathers.<br />The book begins with an invaluable 50 pages introduction by Robert Wang, who is an expert on the subject, and a black and white reproduction of his Golden Dawn deck (which can be bought seperately).<br />It includes Book T (which describes the minor arcana in detail), &quot;The Complete Symbol of the Tarot&quot;, Mrs. Felkin's paper &quot;The Tarot Trumps&quot; (the closest thing there is to a public description of Mather's original major arcana), Waite's explanation from the Pictorial Key to the Tarot to the Celtic Cross spread, and an explanation of a 15 cards spread.<br />I warmly recommend this book to anyone interested in tarot, and especially to those who are interested in decks influenced by the Golden Dawn (Waite's Rider, Crowley's Thoth, the Ciceros', etc).<br />The only downside of this book is that, beside Wang's excellent introduction, the material is available elsewhere, though it would take some effort and time to get all of it collected to one place.	2001-02-04
US	52332300	R28YE0NVLNERUG	000710331X	337076497	Tarot	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An good introductory book to tarot.	...This is a good first book to someone who wants to learn how to read with cards. The book is short, clear, very well printed (high quality paper, card pictures are good, a readable font was chosen, etc), and repeats very little of the rubbish so many other books reiterate (e.g. about the tarot originating from Egypt, etc).<br />Each card is explained by a concise text that presents some practical advice or question to the reader, a few keywords, and a few key words to the card's negative aspects. This allows for a quick study of each card's meanings.<br />Major arcana cards are dedicated two pages each, and suggestions of practical value are given to each card. Minor arcana cards get half a page each.<br />The spreads section is one of the best I've seen - the spreads are practical and goal oriented. The following spread are taught :<br />* The Crossroads Spread, which helps to choose a course of action.<br />* The Triadic Spread, which is a past-present-future spread that I dont like too much.<br />* The Astrological Spread &amp; The Tree of Life Spread. Those two give a lot of insights.<br />*  The Relationships Spread, which is very useful considering 90% of the questions posed to tarot readers have to do with relationships.<br />* and finally the classical Celtic Cross.<br />The cards presented in the book is from a deck I couldnt recognize and the authors didnt clearly identify. The art is good, but the ace through ten of each suite carry simply the appropriate number of the suite's sign. I think this is a bad idea for a beginner's book, and even the authors suggest buying a first deck with meaningful pictures on all cards (e.g. the Rider Waite Smith).<br />I warmly recommend this book to people who are interested in tarot and want to start reading quickly.	2001-01-23

The second part of the book - which is most of it's pages - brings color reproductions of the Visconti-Sforza cards, with commentary on each cards. As the book is out of print, I could find only a black & white photocopy of the book from which I cant say anything about the quality of the cards' reproductions.    As reproductions of the cards are available commercially and the book is out of print for a long time, I think most people would buy this book for commentary on the cards, rather than the reproductions of the cards and thus rate this book based on the text, rather than the pictures.    I find the text disappointing, especially considering the author. Beyond tracing copies of the cards (e.g. who painted them and who owned them at the time of the book's writing, etc) the text is doesnt bring a lot of information.    Some cards - both minor & major arcana - have only a couple of lines of text (e.g. commenting that in the pips of the coin suite with odd number of coins the arrangement is sometimes unusual), and in general I didnt learn much from it.    This is in contrast to such books as Brian Williams' (e.g. Renessance & Minchiate decks), which go much deeper into the history of tarot including comparison of decks and examples of art from the appropriate historical times.    This is a simple book about the deck - basic commentary about it's history and art with no serius attempt to put it in the context of it's time (e.g. art of the time or the works of the artists).	2001-01-12

The book contains the following stories -<br />* Rescue Party - I havent read this story before, and found it a bit disappointing. Actually a bit pointless - just an ode to the human race.<br />* Guardian Angel - this story 'gave birth' to childhood's end. I havent read the book (yet), and have enjoyed the story a lot - especially the little surprise at the end and those parts of the story that show Clarke's scientific background.<br />* Breaking Strain - this story takes a known theme (which I'll not tell even in short so as not to spoil to those who havent read the story) into space, and the fact that it's somewhat predictable made it too long for my taste.<br />* The Sentinel - this story gave the inspiration to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. For some strange reason, I've never found a copy of this story in Israel in any stories collection or translation to Hebrew (though 2001 was translated to Hebrew). Though I allready new the plot, I enjoyed this story a lot.<br />* Jupiter V - I recommend this book just for this story. It's very interesting, and I just couldnt let the book out of my hand till I finished this story.<br />* Refugee.<br />* The Wind from the Sun - the idea of ships that sail by solar-wind race each other really caught me.<br />* A Neeting with Medusa.<br />* The Songs of Distant Earth - actually, I didnt like this one. I've read the 'none-original' version, and liked it a lot better.<br />Now that I take regular 1-hour trips by train twice a week and have returned to reading short stories, I'm glad I've found this book - it's very interesting reading, and shows all the good sides of short stories.	2000-12-22

This deck is the result of serious study and hard work - on both the book and the cards, and the result shows the time and effort that went into it's making.<br />The cards are *very* beutiful - pretier than most new decks. IMHO, they are pretier than the Marseilles &amp; Rider-Waite-Smith decks, as pretty as the Osho Transformational, and would have been as pretty as the Thoth had it the fiery energies that the Thoth has.<br />As another reviewer wrote, the cards are similar to the Rider deck (e.g. 5 &amp; 8 of pentacles, 3 &amp; knight of cups, and 3 &amp; 6 of swords), but this is an original work and no Rider clone - Justice is numbered 8 &amp; Strength is numbered 11, the Fool is not going off a cliff accompanied by a dog, the Magician is not standing in front of a table with the symbols of the four suits, etc.<br />The book is a masterpiece. A clear and excellent introduction to alchemy is given,  along with a section that explains the connection between alchemy &amp; tarot with the assistance of Jungian psychology. Following are chapters explaining the Major &amp; Minor arcana, explaining each card's design and meaning, and a chapter about spreading the cards.<br />Having read several other books that accompany tarot decks, this is one of the best - it's on par with Brian Williams' books on his Renessaince &amp; Minchiate decks, and a much easier reading than Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot and Crowley's Book of Thoth.<br />Though I had to invest some time studying this deck (reading the book slowly and carefuly - it was worth every minute, and doing several readings for myself), this deck quickly became one of my favourites. It's depth makes it a deck that grows with the reader.<br />As far as tarot decks &amp; books go, this is one of my best buys, and I warmly recommend it to anyone who is interested in tarot.	2000-12-13

This book is one of the best introductory books to tarot reading (another excellent book is Joan Bunning's Learning the Tarot).<br />The book contains a short section about the history of the tarot (mediocre - for a good intro check 'Tarot - History, Mystery, and Lore), an excellent chapter about the Major arcana, a good chapter about the minor arcana, a very good section on reading the cards with three spreads (the classical Celtic Cross, a cabalistic Tree of Life spread, and an astrological zodiacal spread), three goof sections about the connection of tarot to Numerology, Astrology, and Cabala, a section about the Fool's journey, and a short glossary of symbolic terms.<br />I warmly recommend this book to anyone who starts studying the tarot with the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, as the book gives all the basics and puts the reader on the right track to continue from there.	2000-12-11

The Minchiate deck is a variant of the better known tarot deck, and differs in the major arcana - there are 41 cards, rather than 22, so there are 97 cards in the deck.<br />The extra major arcana cards include the 12 signs of the zodiac, the 4 elements, and the 4 extra virtues. Due to religious / political reasons, the pope, popess, emperor, and empress are replaced by the grand duke, eastern &amp; western emperors.<br />I find the 18th century art very beutiful, and regretfuly cant give a URL to a site that carries a sample of scanned cards.<br />The deck comes with a small divination booklet, and nothing much beyond that. The only book I'm aware of that goes in details to the Minchiate deck is the one that comes with Brian Williams' Minchiate deck (which I highly recommend).<br />I read mostly with the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, with this being my next most used deck. I highly recommend it to tarot readers and collectors.	2000-12-03

Ms McCullough tells the story of the trojan war in a most interesting way - a political context is presented, the characters' psyche, set of mind, and motivations are presented, and the plot is broken into chapters, each told by a character around which that part of the plot turns, e.g. By Helen, Achiles, and Priamus.<br />The storytelling is great - I was touched by the scene in which Priamus leaves Troy and comes to Achilles and asks him to give him Hector's body so he could give him proper burial, which is minimalist yet touches the heart.<br />This way the plot comes to life, rather than being retold as a myth or dry history, and makes for a great reading.<br />The book is written as prose and doesnt go into great detail when it comes to describing material which isnt a part of the plot (e.g. the ornaments on shields), which makes it more readable than a faithful translation of Homer's Illiad (it's noteworthy that Ms McCullough used material not only from Homer but from other sources as well, such as Virgil and Hesiod).<br />This book makes for a long reading - it took me several hours of reading over a two weeks period - but I enjoyed it a lot, and recommend it with all my heart.	2000-11-17

I'd recommend ordering it along with something else to spread the shipping fees over a couple of items.	2000-10-30

The previous reviewers split between two camps - those who think this book is oversimplified and those who like the book.<br />The main point is that this is NOT an academic text book, so that somebody who studies chemistry academically wouldnt benefit much from it, but rather a popular science book, intended to present complicated material that should be accessable to everybody in a way understandable to the average Joe.<br />That the explanations are simplified is the only solution, considering that the average Joe didnt study quantum mechanics.<br />The book is not big, but it's supposed to be fun and easy to read, and it's price tag isnt big either.<br />I like this book a lot - it presents the material in a readable and enjoyable way, making this basic science (and shouldnt everybody understand basic chemistry ?) accessable to everybody.<br />Though I studied chemistry in high-school and a bit of inorganic chemistry in university, I enjoyed the way the presentation and got another angle on the subject.	2000-10-26

This book was written by one of the first persons to advertise on the Internet, Martha Siegel, a lawyer.<br />The book is problematic in many ways :<br />* Ms. Siegel intentionally misleads the readers.<br />This starts with claims that Netiquette is one of the major reasons that cause people to oppose spammed advertisements via UseNet &amp; email - this is just one reason, and hardly the most important one.<br />It continues with calculations of how much it costs to advertise on various medias in comparison to advertisements via email &amp; UseNet.<br />This is misleading - *the* major reason for people opposing advertisement via email and UseNet is that the advertiser pays only part (half, at most) of the bill. When one sends an email, the recipient pays for it (directly or via the ISP bill) by paying for the communication lines.<br />So her calculations show how much the 'advertiser' has to pay, ignoring how much every person who reads the advertisement has to pay. Ms Siegel should know forcing people to pay for the advertisement borders with theft.<br />E.g. If I recieve an email, I pay to my ISP a monthly bill to cover the price of the lines that connect the mail server to the Internet's backbone, and the more email customers recieve the bigger and more expensive those lines will have to be.<br />Ms. Martha says that if the fact that an email address is made public (e.g. by virtue of it being used on a web page) it's implicitly permissable to send anything to it - why else would it be public ? That's as true as saying that if you have a fence around your house, it's permissable to put advertisements on it - why else would it's outer side be accessible to the public ?<br />She also ignores certain aspects of UseNet, e.g. she says that a newsgroup's name defines what may be or may not be posted to it, while in reality many newsgroups have a charter that declares the rules for the newsgroup, e.g. if advertisements may be sent to it - ISPs will many times decide whether or not to carry a newsgroup based on it's charter and usage against the charter is similar to tresspassing.<br />* Ms Siegel shows a lot of disrespect to people.<br />This starts with name-calling people who object her ways of advertising on the Internet (they're all 'old timers', 'small factions', etc), refering to Internet know-hows as &quot;geeks&quot; and saying many - if not most - are frauds (which is an ugly generalization), to refering to refer to certain acts crimes and their doers criminals even though they were NOT convicted for those dids in court - and as a lawyer she should know better.<br />* Large parts of the book are not relevant to it's title.<br />E.g. the &quot;Crimes in Cyberspace&quot; chapter is all about throwing mud on people and the &quot;What it means to be a pioneer&quot; is all about glorifying herself. I understand that she wants to pat her ego and belittle the Internet know-hows, but two whole chapters is exaggerated, especially her technical advise (some of which outdated by more than one would expect from the book's publishing date) show that she is of mediocre Internet skills.<br />All in all, this book does a miserable job of helping people to make money on the Internet, is highly unethical, and spends far too much time on presenting her inner drama of her greatness vs the know-hows pettiness.	2000-10-19

This hilarious book looks at the life - or at least that significant part of life spent at work - of an employee at a large corporation.    I've read this book while working for Intel Israel, but the book reminded me of my previous work for the Israeli army (probably because my managers and coworkers at Intel did their job well).    The memories of being assigned ridiculus tasks by pilots & tank commanders turned project managers by virtue of 'hiding in the attic for 4 years' resurfaced, as well as memories of enlisted personnel being trained to become officers en-masse in place of technical training (little budget for professional courses, lots of budget to train the technically untrained to become managers).    Being able to look back and laugh at it was a releasing experience.    How many people were rewarded for saving a few cents' worth of printer paper, and then order by a major to spend thousands of dollars from one of the squadron's budgets so that a big amount of money would be allocated to it the next year, and being reprehended for failing ?    The ability to look at corporate life with all their beurocratic wierd twists and illogical abberations and laugh is most refreshing.	2000-10-18

This deck is a reproduction of a centuries old Marseilles deck, rather than a new Marseilles-like deck.<br />The Marseilles deck is the historical predecessor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's tarot deck, and it's influence can be seen on the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, the Crowley Thoth deck, and Wang's Golden Dawn deck.<br />The deck is worth it's price just to get a perspective or background on those prominent decks. I've found Wang's book on his deck a valuable addition.<br />The deck is artistically beutiful, yet simple - it has only four or five basic colours, and the pictures are simple and not loaded with symbolism (in contrast to the Crowley Thoth or the Haindl tarot).<br />It's interesting to look at the Camoin &amp; Jodorowsky's restoration of the Tarot de Marseilles, which is based on hand drawn versions of the deck (the 'modern' version are based on the first printed versions, which had to use a small number of colours), which can be seen at (...).<br />This deck is very comfortable to shuffle - the cards are relatively narrow and long, and made of good material. An instructions booklet, which contains several spreads and card intepretations, which are quite different from those of Waite and Crowley, e.g. the 2s through 10s of each suit have no reversed meaning (the cards are symmetrical).<br />I've found the instruction booklet sufficient for people who simply want to read with the deck, but it covers nothing else.<br />There are some books on reading with the Tarot of Marseilles deck, so one can find plenty of literature to expand on the booklet. I agree with the previous reviewer that Sallie Nichols' Jung and Tarot is a good one, though be warned that :<br />- The book is about the major arcana only, and the minor arcana (pips and court cards) are not discussed.<br />- The book is psychological in nature, and it gives a lot of psychological insights, it is not a book about reading with the cards per-se.<br />For the historical perspective, thereare several other good books, e.g. Dummet's books and the first two volumes of the Encyclopedia of the Tarot.	2000-10-16

I'll start with a warning that, in contrast to the Osho Zen tarot deck, this deck is NOT a tarot deck in the traditional sense - it is a set of less than 78 cards, not divided into major arcana and 4 suits of minor arcana.<br />Some versions of this deck feature an extra card with Osho's picture, which is missing from this version. Personally, I dont like this card as I feel as if it encourages a personality cult.<br />This set includes 60 cards. The art is beutiful and simple - no heavy symbolism (= no astrology, numerology, cabbala, etc) as in decks like Crowley Thoth or Rider-Waite-Smith.<br />The book gives for each card a short explanation and a story from which the scene on the card is taken. The stories are multi-cultural (zen stories, jewish stories, chrisitian stories, etc), feature known figures (e.g. Moses, famous zen teachers), and are very enlightening.<br />The stories themselves are interesting and readable enough to make this deck worth it's price just for the value of the book as reading material.<br />The deck leads to a warm and personal reading style - both the reader and the readee can relate to the stories and figures in the cards. The reading session has more in common with story telling than with horoscopes (a la 'you'll meet a tall dark stranger') which is different from, and to my taste favourable over, that encouraged by other decks.<br />All in all I highly and warmly recommend this deck.	2000-10-10

I've first heard about the research behind this book in a local newspaper that covered a TV show that discussed it. The claim that 10% of children were not the offsprings of their presumed fathers stuck in my mind.<br />I bought this book in order to get the details from the &quot;horse's mouth&quot;.<br />Some reviewers have written that this book brings unbased theories. They probably got this impression because this is a &quot;popular science&quot; book - it brings the research's results in a way readable &amp; accessable, rather than the research details and analysis (which are available in a seperate volume, which is prohibitively expensive - well over $100. I think it's price should be significantly reduced to make it a reasonable buy for the average person).<br />The book presents the material in a very clear way - 37 short scenes describing various sexual behaviours are told, followed by explanations of the whys and mechanisms behind the scenes. The scenes build one on top of the other - the first scenes are used to explain the basic &amp; simple principles, while later scenes are used to explain the finer cases.<br />The explanations might be shocking to some people, but are actually logical. Every person wants to have as many descendents (children, as well as grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc.) as possible (the less descendents one has, the less influence one has on the human population / gene pool at any future time).<br />So a woman, who have to invest a lot of time, effort, money, etc to raise each child (at least for the time of pregnancy) naturally want an &quot;ideal man&quot; by their side to help her raise each child - a man who has a long life expectency (= healthy), has a lot of resources (= wealthy), loyal (= wouldnt disappear and leave her with her childs), stable (= doesnt take risks), has good genes (= his genes would help her have more descendents), etc.<br />A man would like to find the same characterstics in a woman (healthy, wealthy, loyal, has good genes, etc), but has the option to 'launch &amp; forget' - impregnate a woman and leave her during pregnancy, letting her raise a child in which she has an interest while going on to the next woman.<br />The crucial point is that women have to make compromises on their partners, while men want to excercise their special option.<br />This leads to infidelity - a woman may choose to live / marry a man who is wealthy, stable, and loyal (= so that he wouldnt spend his resources on children he has by other women) but get the genes from another man (who is judged by health, beuty, etc).<br />A man would like to help his kids, and would therefore want his woman/women to be loyal and prevent them from getting impregnated by other men, but still use the Cuckoo's trick of having other men raise his children by other women.<br />And those two paragraphs summarize the motives behind loyalty &amp; monogamy vs. infidelity, as explained by the book.<br />This book has explicit sex descriptions, which makes it somewhat pornographical and inappropriate for kids without being too explicit for the average adult., loyal, has good genes, etc), but has the option to 'launch &amp; forget' - impregnate a woman and leave her during pregnancy, letting her raise a child in which she has an interest while going on to the next woman.<br />The crucial point is that women have to make compromises on their partners, while men want to excercise their special option.<br />This leads to infidelity - a woman may choose to live / marry a man who is wealthy, stable, and loyal (= so that he wouldnt spend his resources on children he has by other women) but get the genes from another man (who is judged by health, beuty, etc).<br />A man would like to help his kids, and would therefore want his woman/women to be loyal and prevent them from getting impregnated by other men, but still use the Cuckoo's trick of having other men raise his children by other women.<br />And those two paragraphs summarize the motives behind loyalty &amp; monogamy vs. infidelity, as explained by the book.<br />This book has explicit sex descriptions, which makes it somewhat pornographical and inappropriate for kids without being too explicit for the average adult.	2000-10-09

This book makes an excellent reading about tarot - it's very readable, and it approaches the subject in a sensible way.<br />The first four chapters deal with the history of tarot, which is presented in a based manner (= based on what historians can tell about tarot) rather than in a romanticezed manner (= based on wild fantasies, e.g. about the tarot originating in egypt).<br />The next four chapters describe the &quot;mystery&quot; of tarot - it's relationships with such subjects as alchemy, kabbala, chakras, etc. Included is an explanation of why does tarot works based on quantum physics, which I personally dont like - it sounds too much like psuedo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.<br />The last part deals with tarot lore - a part that lists various types of decks, which is nice for somebody who wants to find a deck to her taste, an excellent list of books about tarot, and a dozen tarot ideas which is recreational if nothing else.<br />All in all, I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in tarot. It's 97% gold, 3% tin, and a gem in a time where tarot is misunderstood by many.	2000-09-28

This gives the text some power, but think a bit longer descriptions would be better. The characters are somewhat thin (the father is just a fanatic priest, a jealus wife is just a jealus wife, etc), but are well done for the book's length.<br />[Interesting comparison to books like Crime and Punishment, which was written for an audience with more free time - not to mention that the author was paid by page and needed the money, to this book which is probably intended to be read over otherwise &quot;dead period&quot; (flight, long train trip) of a busier person. Another interesting comparison is to King Rat.]	2000-09-26
US	52332300	RCUYC3Y1L7KXY	0684849739	431236317	The Bible Code	Books	3	14	19	N	N	Interesting reading, but the math doesnt look solid.	As an Israely, I read this book in Hebrew when it came out here.<br />I'll give the book the credit of being good reading material - I read the whole book in two sessions in two consecutive days.<br />But I've found the book's main claim to be unbased, at least as far as I could judge it, for two reasons.<br />The first reason is that when the author finds in the bible predictions for events that have already happened (e.g. the text, written over 2000 years ago, predicting Rabin's murder which took place some time before the book was written), the author brings bible sections with lots of words all describing the event.<br />But when he shows sections predicting events to occur after the book's writing, the sections have much fewer words in them. This is because he doesnt know *what* to search, and therefore *cant* find it in the text. This means either that the code wasnt cracked (if it was, he could find the predictions there, couldnt he ? that's the whole point of cracking a code, e.g. the German Enigma code in WWII) or that there's no bible code.<br />The second problem is with the math - all the calculations are based on the probability of finding the specific words actually found in the bible.<br />The point is that for each event different word sets could have been used. E.g. if there are a ten words in the section, and each of them has just three synonyms (or even different spellings, which is common in Hebrew), then there are 3^10 &gt; 500,000 equivalent sections and the probability of finding such a section is half a million larger than presented.<br />Example - one can say Rabbin was murdered, or alternately killed, shot, or slain and each of those words would be as surprising in the text as any of the other three.   Finally, the same event can be described in different ways and angles (a la Rashomon), which makes the probability even larger.	2000-09-25

Basically, I like this deck - it's the standard Rider-Waite deck, sized  down to 'pocket size' and used to carry it in my pouch on account of the  standard size deck being to big.<br />But when I came across the pocket, which  is sized between the regular size and this deck's size, I gave up on this  deck. The main problem is that the cards are a bit too small to be really  comfortable - it's a bit uncomfortable to shuffle and the eye doesnt catch  the details as easily.<br />Personally, I see no reason to make a deck smaller  than the size of a regular playing cards deck.	2000-09-07

I've read half a dozen tarot beginner's book or so in the past two years  or so, and this is definitely the best I've seen.<br />The material is broken  into 18 lessons, of which 7 cover the card meanings themselves (three for  the minor arcana, one for the court cards, and three for the major arcana),  and 6 cover spreading &amp; reading the cards with examples.<br />The text is  concise, and for each card there's a section explaining it's symbolism and  meanings when straight and reversed. The explanations are solid - Eden Gray  knows the material well, and draws on Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot  and the Golden Dawn's Book T (an improvement over many authors who just  babble whatever comes to their minds).<br />The book covers basic numerology  and astrology, which gives a larger view and explains the explanations.<br />I  highly recommend this book as a first study guide to anyone who learns to  read with the Rider-Waite deck.	2000-09-06

I first saw this deck in a new age shop, and bought it on a whim - it was so beutiful I just couldnt leave it in the shop.<br />[that was a mistake - I  would have paid half the price had I ordered it through Amazon.com, using  air-mail shipping]<br />The cards are very beutiful, drawn in soft pastel  colours, and the deck is worth it's price for the art itself, if nothing  else. The cards are large, which gives room to the detailed art, which  makes it a bit hard to shuffle the cards.<br />The book is excellent - every  card gets a couple of pages of explanations, which retell the relevant  fairytale shortly with a brief psychological explanation, and explains the  card's meaning clearly.<br />The cards and book come in a quality box. The  cards are smaller than the book, so they come in a box with internal  cardbox walls that detach easily - my only complaint. I have a problem  finding either a bag or a wood box the size of the cards.<br />I think this is  a *great* deck, and highly recommend it.	2000-08-27

This book explains how to read with the standard playing cardsdeck in a concise way, with no extraneus material.<br />After a short introduction, the card's meanings are explained a card a page, with an extra page for each suit. The explanations are short and to the point, clear, and very understandable. For some reason, each explanation is accompanied with the card's picture which is scanned in very low resolution and printed in black &amp; white.<br />In my opinion Astrolog should have either dropped the pictures completely (everybody knows how the cards look, so why reproduce it, especially such a poort reporduction) or at least reproduce the cards in good resolution and with colours.<br />The last section includes several good spreads, explained well over 34 pages, with a few pages with hints for correct interpretation. The subject of reversed cards is covered as well.<br />All in all, I find this book to be a good one, but wish Astrolog would not have reproduced the pictures to produce a smaller and just as useful book.	2000-08-03

I bought this books's translation to Hebrew a few months ago, as I like carrying tarot accessories in my pouch. This book is concise and very useful, e.g. to refresh my memory at times.<br />The book contains card  meanings for each card, and a few spreads, starting with a three cards  spread to the ten cards celtic cross.<br />The book is not tied to any  specific deck, and the descriptions are brief enough to fit any deck, but  the book was not written with the Rider-Waite deck in mind, considering the  order of the trumps.<br />There are two problems with this book :<br />- Some  cards are given only partial explanation, e.g. the card's meaning for a man  but not for a woman or the reversed card's meaning is not explicitly  explained.<br />- The Hebrew translation isnt very well edited, and some  errors slipped in, e.g. one card is missing from the layout of the celtic  cross.<br />And finally, some cards call for a 'juicier' definition, e.g.  Justice especially considering what Crowley had to say about it.	2000-08-02

I like this deck's colours, which are generally more attractive than those of the regular Rider-Waite deck, but the changed details are too much for me.<br />Examples -<br />The sun card : the flag is shown as having one side  orange as in the original deck and one side red as the book says the whole  flag should be, the sun is missing a ray, and the sun's face are painted to  look softer and feminine.<br />The High Priestess : the garments are coloured  differently (the inner white, the outer blue, and the head cover white),  which is nice but the effect of the garments turning to water is  lost.<br />The Lovers card : the leafs on the tree behind the man are mostly  yellow, and dont look much like flames like they should - it's an important  connection between the Devil card and the Lovers card.<br />And the list  continues, e.g. it looks like the sun rises behind the emperor and the  magician has a white hallo.<br />In my opinion, the details are very important  and those changes modify the cards' meanings, and being used to the  original details I feel uncomfortable using the deck.<br />The colouring's  advantage is to make the cards warmer and more attractive, which are pluses  for new readers who are a bit afraid of the original harsher colouring.	2000-07-27

Hacks are not cheese,  and cant be thrown out after two weeks.<br />Second, a sysadmin should get the  basic information, terms, ways of thought, etc - and this book will teach  this well - and then continuously look for new information and information  sources.<br />This includes finding out about bugtraq, ntbugtraq, phrack, and  any other new mailing lists and web sites regularily.<br />So I highly  recommend this book to anyone who deals with the subject of unix &amp;  internet security.	2000-07-18

This book starts with a good general introduction to tarot, with a bias toward the Rider-Waite deck, which makes it a good book for beginners.<br />It continues with the author's own variation on the celtic cross - most  authors do that, but I wish they would either invent original relationships  spreads or at least not invent new variations of the same spread,<br />The  book then continues, unsurprisingly, to give the meaning of each card in  each position and when being reverse or straight.<br />The meanings are good,  though not original or exceptionaly good. I wish the author would at least  explain the system by which s/he arrived at those meanings - it would make  memorization that much easier.<br />All in all, I think it fairs well in it's  area and delivers what one would expect from the title, but would recommend  it only to beginners.	2000-07-16

This book's main part is a collection of cards meanings from different major tarot book authors, collected with the purpose of getting to a card's meaning by integrating the different texts written about the card.<br />This  is, indeed, very useful - it's like appreciating a precious cut stone by  looking at it from different angles and directions.<br />I like reading the  descriptions, e.g. poems by Aleister Crowley, heavy text by Waite, Angeles  Arrien's text, and Mary greer's text.<br />Actually, I like this book so much  that I take it along with my tarot deck to refresh my memory and view of  cards.<br />This is a very good approach, but with a slight problem - the  descriptions are for different decks (e.g. Rider Waite, Thoth, and  Motherpeace), so a reader would get the general idea of a card but must  still know the nuances of the deck she works with and which nuances belong  to other decks.	2000-07-13

I've first bought this book when I started my academic studies, after 5 years of work with Fortran 77 & three years of work with Pascal.<br /><br />This small book (270 pages, including the index) served me well through my degree, and I still keep the dog-eared, yellowing, aged book with me at work.<br /><br />The book focuses on the language itself - this is no hands-on book (no explanations on how to use this compiler or that debugger, though it is a little biased toward Unix) - in a clear, concise, and thorough way covering all of the language and it's standard libraries.<br /><br />I especially liked the excercises (the solutions come in a seperate volume) and the C source code examples of how some of the library routines are (or may be) implemented.<br /><br />With this book I had no problem understanding the more difficult subjects (e.g. many people have problems with pointers, and this book makes the subject easy to understand) and avoiding pitfalls.<br /><br />I've read it in a week, and keeping it in hand's reach smoothly started programming in C.<br /><br />The only drawback I see in this book is it's price, it's a small book which sells *very* well, and I'd expect it's price to be lower. This book is *not* for people who study C as their first programming language (those would be better served with a pair of books - a first course in programming and compiler guide).	2000-07-12

I've bought this deck for the pocket sized &quot;Key to the Tarot&quot; and in order to compare the original deck to the regular deck.<br />After a check it turned out the deck is anything but original and the book is  anything but complete.<br />The deck is a reproduction of a low quality deck  printed before WWII (the plates were lost - apparently during WWII or  before - so there's no way to know how the deck was *really* supposed to  look).<br />The errors are evident, as an example, in the Chariot card. The  belt is different from the B&amp;W copy of the card in the original  Pictorial Key to the Tarot.<br />Another difference is in the colours, which  due to personal taste I just dont like.<br />And for the book - material,  which IMHO is important is missing, e.g. part of the text describing the  Chariot card, which was present in the original Key to the Tarot.<br />So I  just bought a large pouch so I can carry a copy of the Pictorial Key,  rather then rely on a crippled version of the book.<br />My recommendation is  to pass over this set and just buy the regular (yellow boxed) Rider deck  and a copy of The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (available from several  publishers).	2000-07-05

This was my first tarot deck, and even though I have over 25 decks today it's still my favourite.<br />Waite's deck is good for both beginners and seasoned readers - it's easy enough to start with, but deep and complex  enough for those who dig deep to find more and more meanings in it.<br />I'll  give examples to explain what I mean :<br />[1] The Tarot de Marseilles is  another excellent and popular deck, but has the drawback of having  geometrical pips, which make it hard to read for beginners - unless the  reader has a very good memory, she'll have a hard time handling about half  the deck.<br />[2] Aleister Crowley's Thoth deck is as popular and good a deck  as Waite's, and would certainly reward those who learn all the appropriate  associations (e.g. astrology), but for someone who knows that material  there's only a small extra penalty in remembering the associations for the  Waite deck on account of the missing symbols.<br />[3] The Conolly deck is  based on Waite's and is friendly to both the new reader and the readee, but  is 'dumbed down' and doesnt have the symbolical depth of the Rider, so an  experienced reader would most probably leave the Conolly deck in favour of  the Rider-Waite or Thoth decks.<br />The Rider-Waite deck is very christian in  it's symbology, with some Judaistic symbols (e.g. Cabbala) in it [as is the  Thoth deck] so people who want a deck with a symbology coming from a  different culture might want to opt for some other deck (e.g. the Haindl  tarot, the Osho Zen tarot, etc).<br />Some of the deck's advantages are not  directly related to it's images - it's popularity means there are many  books about it to learn from, it's cheap and widely available (if you lost  your copy and want to buy a new one or want to buy someone a deck as a  present), etc.	2000-06-18

This 60 cards deck has become one of my favourites instantly - the cards touch the soul and speak with it directly.<br />The accompanying tiny white book doesnt list any titles or meanings to the cards - the pictures are  intuitively understood, somehow their meaning is  self-explanatory/evident.<br />The cards themselves are of the highest quality  I've seen yet - good cardboard with shining coating that, in combination  with the excellent art, are, IMO, good enough to be hanged on an art  gallery's wall.<br />The cards can be used for both reflection and divination,  and I almost immediately started using it for myself in place of the  Rider-Waite-Smith deck.<br />The one small thing I dont like about this deck  is it's somewhat dark colours, which gave a couple of my friends a first  impression of being, well, somewhat dark and scary.<br />The box, which is of  good material, doesnt have any mechanism to keep it closed, so I keep the  cover closed with a ruber band.<br />And a clarification - this is not a tarot  deck proper, as it appears that some reviewers expect of it to be. Though  some of the cards are comparable to tarot cards, it does not derive from  the 78 cards tarot decks, doesnt have suits or minor/major arcanas.	2000-06-07

US	52332300	R13VMLYEHPRTT8	0877288291	532088748	Tarot Card Combinations	Books	4	38	41	N	Y	A good second book on tarot	This is not a beginner's first book, but rather second book.<br />Most books I know give more or less detailed description of each card, a couple of spreads, and maybe a few examples.<br />For a tarot beginner who does not yet  have a lot of experience, a book of that type does not give enough examples  of how to interpret a few cards together.<br />And that's where this book fits  in - it gives a lot of tarot cards combinations (with both straight and  reversed cards) and their meanings.<br />A previous reviewer wrote that only  keyword meanings of cards are given and that the way the combinations  meanings are not explained.<br />The first issue is, in my humble opinion, a  minor issue *if* the book is not used as one's first tarot book.<br />The  second is, in my opinion, a good challenge for the reader - figuring out  the way the meaning was reached makes for a better studying.	2000-06-05

This deck is a Rider-Waite-Smith variant, with the cards redrawn with art from the Alice books.<br />The art is as beutiful as that of the book, and as the deck is based on RWS, anyone familiar with the former can read with  this deck with no effort at all.<br />The suits of the minor arcana were  changed, as noted in a previous review, which personally I find a little  confusing.<br />The deck is made in high quality, with the regular exception  of the cardbox, which is a pitty - it's worth keeping for the art's  sake.<br />As an Alice fan and being familiar with the RWS deck, I really like  this deck.<br />I dont read for kids (and I think I would prefer to read with  the Inner Child Cards for kids), this deck is reserved for readings in  parties and other merry situations.	2000-06-01
US	52332300	RKPRLT8BPEYBW	0913866083	336652403	The Pictorial Key to the Tarot	Books	4	79	84	N	Y	A hard to read, obscure, and confusing little book.	I've bought this book with expectations of getting loads of information in it, and was somewhat disappointed by it.<br />The book suffers from several problems :<br />- The book is a hard reading - Waite's style is obfuscated,  which makes the non-trivial material harder to understand.<br />- Waite doesnt  tell the whole truth, and not even half of it, not to mention the inclusion  of misinformation. Examples include unexplained symbols (symbols on  charioteer's belt, the fool's clothings, and many others), desciption of  the emptress being 'virgo intacta', etc.<br />- Some of the cards'  descriptions contradict, or at least appear to contradict, the pictures on  the cards.<br />- Waite borrows a lot from earlier writers, but then goes on  to pass criticism on his sources and belittles them.<br />So the book has to  be read very carefuly, criticaly, and with a lot of patience. And those who  do so *will* gain - the book is better than many of the instant tarot  reading guides, giving truer and deeper information from the horse's  mouth.<br />I suggest people to read this book, but *not* as the first book on  the deck, and preferably along with other material (e.g. books about the  golden dawn, tarot history, or symbolism).	2000-06-01

This is a very good encyclopedic book about routing, written by a writer who shows his talents and knowledge.<br />It gives a very thorough cover of routing at the level of a good study book, which is lacking from the  popular TCP/IP books.<br />This book was written some years ago, and it's age  shows, e.g. in it's cover of BGP4 and IPv6.<br />I recommend this book  wholeheartly, with the warning that people who need to actually work with  specific routing protocol(s) nowadays should buy a current book.	2000-05-30

I really love this deck - the art is the most beutiful I've yet seen in a tarot deck, the book is informative and very well made, and the casing very well designed.<br />This is the deck I use to read for people on matters of the heart - people are just amazed with the cards' art.<br />The case, which holds the book and the cards and closed by a ribbon, is of good quality, especially when compared to the short-lived card boxes most decks come in today.<br />The deck contains only the 22 major arcana cards, which are the largest I've seen to date. The cards are hard to shuffle, but two or three shuffles and drawing the cards from a fan is good enough for a deck with just 22 cards.<br />Since I bought this deck and started reading with it, two of my friends (one a reader and another a readee) asked me to get them this deck. This deck really spoke to them.	2000-05-30

This book covers a need distinct from the first two volumes - the first two covered the core protocols' internals, while this one covers the application level protocols - a subject hardly covered by any other book.<br />I've found this book very useful for understanding T/TCP, a subject  my teacher did not explain well and was obscure for me.<br />The NNTP &amp;  HTTP cover was useful, especially as I was doing a lab on HTTP, but I must  admit that as far as HTTP goes the RFCs were sufficient.	2000-05-30

This is a good book written by someone who really knows the material.<br />The book *is* somewhat out of date - a three years old book on a developing protocol cant be current [and it's my expectation that a new  edition would be printed soon], but it's a very good way to get the big  picture about it before starting to read the fine details in the RFCs.<br />As  other reviewers wrote, the comparison between IPv4 and IPv6 is a little  lacking, but this book is *not* intended to be read as one's first text on  IP - it's audience is people who are already familiar with IPv4.	2000-05-17

This is a small book - just 36 small pages, but is worth it's weight in gold to me.<br />The cards are line drawings, and are not very artistic (e.g. in the Knight of Cups the waves show through the horse's back feet), but  along with the appendice very enlightening.<br />I guess Westcott wasnt as  good an artist as Pamela Smith or Lady Harris (or wasnt trying hard), so  the drawings are not good art per se.<br />Comparing the pictures with the  court cards from Wang's Golden Dawn Tarot Deck shows that Wang's  minimalistic pictures are faithful to the source - the original drawings  dont have a lot of details, though they're a bit more detailed  Wang's.<br />The appendie contain such information as tables of colours  correspondences to astrology signs, planets, notes, tree of lifes, etc and  some explanations of symbols that appear in the cards.<br />This is not an  instruction book - it's just card drawings and tables manuscripts, but the  information is not widely available elsewhere.	2000-05-14

I can't testify as to the accuracy of the cards' symbolism (I haven't gotten the appropriate books  yet), but what I've seen gave me some insights.  The main problem I see with the deck is it's art, which, IMHO, is mediocre and to which I can't connect. It's a far cry from the art  of Crowley's  deck, and isn't as good as the art of Waite's \\"cartoonish\\" deck.	2000-05-01

The  devil card has become materialism - just one   aspect of the card, and the contrast is easy  to see in the Death card -  all the symbols have  vanished in favour of making a simple image  to  symbolize transition.<br /> The comparison between the publisher's bombastic   declaration made a decade ago that the deck would  surely take the place of  the Rider-Waite deck and  the deck's popularity today (any decent shop  has  at least 4 Rider-Waite decks on it's shelves,  while hardly any puts on the  shelve, or has,  Connoly's deck) attests to the difference in  quality  between the decks.	2000-05-01

I like the Thoth deck a lot, but this edition  has two major problems.<br /> First, the cards are rather large which make the  deck hard to shuffle.<br /> Second, the cards have a greenish hue and the  colours are somewhat dead,  especially compared  to the other edition.<br /> Personally, I recommnd people  to buy the smaller  livlier coloured edition.	2000-04-27
US	52332300	R36NBGGHR84FI1	0943358019	268043888	Wisdom of the Tarot	Books	4	26	30	N	Y	A good book, with some colour problems.	This book has an accompanying deck of the 22  major arcana cards - no minor arcana. The cards  I bought come in a plastic slip - an improvement  over the cardboard boxes.<br /> The cards themselves are conservative &amp;  simple,  no complex scenes in the background and they are  similar to  Rider-Waite cards and Italian decks,  but I find them pretty. They  certainly serve  the purpose of the book.<br /> [for some reason I couldnt  find the deck in   Amazon or B&amp;N - I bought it in a shop in Haifa]<br />  The cards, in colours, are reproduced in the  book. The English source has  the cards printed  as the first 11 pages of the book, which is less   convinient than the hebrew translation that has  the card printed at the  beginning of the section  that explains it.<br /> I really like the book  because it explains every  detail of every card. The only problem is that   sometimes the explanation doesnt match the cards,  e.g. the text says (in  both the Hebrew and  English versions) that the woman in the world  card  wears a red cloth while the picture (in both  the English &amp; Hebrew  books and in the cards) she  wears a blue cloth.	2000-01-12

This is a very interesting deck, which I like a  lot, especially as a reference with which to  compare other decks. I'm happy I bought the  deck - I use it alot.<br /> But there are a few things I dont like about it :<br />   1. Some of the details are coloured in such      a way to make them  somewhat hard to      distinguish from the background.<br />  2. The cards  dont have their names on them.      I wish the names were added on a white       boundary, making it easier to recognize.<br />  3. Just a warning to those  who want to spread      with the cards - their somewhat large and      not  very easy to shuffle.	1999-11-21

This is a really beutiful deck, which I find  easy to use.

I'd expect :<br /> 1. The chapter about muscles to be close to or      preceding the section about stretching. The     design keeps the relevant  info too far apart.<br /> 2. A list of stretching excercises to be given      with pictures. No excercises are given at all     (though there are plenty  of space given to     useless pictures, e.g. of a computerized bike      panel), denying me the info I need.<br />The section recommends buying a video  that shows how to stretch. For the price of a video and a video cassete  (about $300 in Israel) I could get personal training.<br />The &quot;Nutrition  Basics&quot; chapter is another disappointment - five and a half pages are  spent on vitamins providing less information than given in leaflets given  for free in pharmacies, the section about titled &quot;Watch Your  Calories&quot; gives trivial advice, and no table of caloric values of  different kinds of foods is included, etc.<br />I find this book very  disappointing, will not buy any other &quot;for dummies&quot; books, and  will sell this book at a second hand books store - at least I'll get some  of my money back and not waste any shelve space on this useless book.	1999-08-03
