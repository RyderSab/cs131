I have to say that I'm disappointed that this book is out of print. It  was my favorite book when I was younger. Being a little girl with two gay dads myself, I really related to Jenny, who had blonde hair just like I  did. Since there weren't any other books back then with families that  looked like mine, I dragged this one practically everywhere I went. My copy  is very old and tattered. I wish this book were available today, especially  considering how few books there are that portray gay and lesbian families  positively.	1999-09-10

I hesitate to speak negatively about this book because obviously there are  people out there for whom it would be helpful. But as an adoptee myself, there was absolutely nothing in this book that I related to. I never felt  wounded or rejected because I was adopted, and after reading and talking  with women who have placed children for adoption, I can only say that I  look on it as a an act made for the benefit of their babies and for the  loving parents out there who cannot biologically have children. I would not  recommend this book to adult adoptees who feel that they are well-adjusted  and come from a position where they realize both the challenges and the  joys of adoption. Sad to say, I saw much of this book as people 'blaming'  their personal problems on having been adopted.	1999-08-30

I enjoy reading diaries, especially from the past, and gaining more insight into people's thoughts and feelings. While I didn't dislike Helen Jacobus Apte as much as some other reviewers did, I did think that her  diary was a trifle boring.

This is a good resource for parents who want to provide their children with books focusing on the African-American experience.

She has to deal with her loving but strained relationship with  her divorced mother and feels like she is lagging behind her boy crazy best  friend. Then she  finds out that her father's relationship with his  best  friend isn't what she thought it was. Her discovery that her father is gay  and that his partner is moving in with them is handled in a realistic  fashion. I strongly recommend this book to young teens, especially those  who have dealt with a parent's coming out at a time when their own  sexuality is just beginning to emerge.	1999-07-23

The child discusses some of the activities his dad and Frank do together (activities which are familiar to all kinds of families). For example, they work, eat, sleep, shave and fight together, and always make up. The boy then describes how important Frank is to him and how Frank, as a co-parent, likes him and helps the boy feel comfortable, safe, and loved.    This book might appeal to children who, after their parents get divorced or are separated, live with one parent and visit the other parent and his/her new partner. The explanation given by the mother for being gay is one many children will understand. She says being gay is &quot;just one more kind of love and love is the best kind of happiness.&quot; One teacher of nine- and ten-year-old children was uncomfortable with the fact that it is the mother in this story who explained the father's sexual orientation. It would be nice to see the adults in these stories take responsibility (and control) over explaining and feeling proud of their own lives and families.   Still, DADDY'S ROOMMATE presents a positive connection among gay people, love and family with illustrations of the father and Frank hugging, shaving, sleeping and caring for each other. Of the five illustrations which show the two men physically and emotionally together, only one occurs outdoors, when Frank is placing suntan lotion on the father's back at the beach. The almost exclusive private expression of love may reinforce, for some, the fact that their intimate lives cannot be exhibited in the public eye.   With the mention of the parent's divorce on the first page, the story implies that the young boy was once raised by and lived with his mother and father until his father moved out and fell in love with another man. Given the often messy divorce relationships after a marriage breaks up, it is interesting to see how well this child's biological parents get along (this may not reflect the reality in the lives of many children). As well, in the case of children who were born and raised or adopted into a gay-headed household, the biological mother may not have ever been a part of the family structure or the child's experiences. When reading the book to these young children, the first two pages can be skipped so that the story is begun where it reads: &quot;Daddy and his roommate Frank live together.&quot; The color illustrations and short text make DADDY'S ROOMMATE appropriate for children as young as three.	1998-01-05

He begins to ask people around the park for help. The McFinks think he doesn't have a family because he does not have &quot;...a mom, a dad, two kids and two cars. And a house, and a yard, and a dog (or a cat).&quot; Fortunately for him, he is able to escape (with the help of the Zark) and finds himself with MJ and Don. He is disbelieving of their generosity and willingness to help him find his moms until they describe their own family structure; a heterosexual couple with kids of their own who adopted several other children from different cultural backgrounds. They also explain that &quot;real families come in all forms and all sizes.&quot; They all search through the park and finally locate the moms near the Lost and Found.   There is a lot going on in this book that I wonder if children under the age of ten are able to take it all in. A story of a young child getting lost perhaps should not include anything other than the way in which he is safely returned to his parents, whether he has two moms, two dads or lives with grandparents. Several of the illustrations do not add to the sense of safety one would hope a lost child encounters. For example, when he reaches the McFinks, Mr. McFink is holding a potato in one hand and in the other hand he has a very noticeable sharp knife and Mrs. McFink holds a sharp nail file (which also looks like a knife). The illustrations border on cartoon like characters and at times their facial expressions are rather frightening. To an adult it is clear that one message which the illustrations portrait is that there are some heterosexuals who are unsafe and perhaps unfit parents. After the young boy has met MJ and Don the illustrations are much more pleasant and comforting. In my opinion, the story would have been more successful if he had not met the McFinks.	1998-01-05

At three years old, Heather joins a play group where it is suggested for the first time that she has no daddy. While the children are drawing pictures and discussing their diverse families (children with two daddies, one mommy and no daddy, a mommy and step-father, adopted family and nuclear family) the teacher acknowledges that &quot;each family is special.&quot;   HEATHER HASTWO MOMMIES has been the focus of a great deal of controversy in school districts and with parents and other adults. This is a lengthy story which can be seen as an &quot;explanatory book&quot; because of the focus on spelling out how Heather's family began. Part of the story is dedicated to: how Heather's mommies were friends for a long time, fell in love and decided to live together, how they created a family, visited a fertility doctor and extended their family with a child. There is even a page or two on the types of careers the women have. Mama Jane, the biological mother, is a carpenter and Mama Kate is a doctor.   The discussion of alternative insemination includesvisiting the &quot;special&quot; doctor, putting some sperm in Mama Jane's vagina, and the sperm and egg meeting in the womb. This detail is needed to explain how Heather was created without a father. This section makes for interesting conversation among eight year olds, for example, who are beginning to question and understand the world of sexuality and family configurations, or even six- or seven-year-olds who are wondering how a child cannot have a father because &quot;you need a mother and father to make a baby.&quot;   These issues and the book's length may cause the book to be considered inappropriate for casual reading with children in a school setting under the age of six. However, it may be an interesting selection to help support discussions with individual children on different types of families or, more specifically, for lesbian parents needing to carefully explain to their children how they were created. This was the first of a wave of literature which explicitly depicted and discussed a lesbian-headed family in the U.S. (published in 1989). For many families, this book was extremely helpful because it addressed some of the concerns of young children of lesbian parents which were not addressed in other children's literature.   One somewhat confusing aspect of the book is that while the black and white illustrations were appropriate for young children, the text seemed more appropriate for older children. Because of its illustrations, and by altering the text, this book can be used with young children because there are interesting depictions of the women hugging each other, of Kate's hands on Jane's womb when she is nine months pregnant, and of the women caring for Heather in a number of instances. The details in each illustration, and the way the black and white sketches do not prohibit the audience from detecting various ethnic and racial differences among the children makes them find contributions to works for children. At the same time, some of the details of the illustrations are incongruous with the story. The children's drawings of their families, for instance, are extremely detailed for 3-year-old children, many of whom are not yet doing representational drawing. This small criticism, however, should not keep parents or teachers from reading the book to young children.	1998-01-04

A young girl is very curious about his blue dads and asks many questions which Lou thinks are rather silly. For example, she wants to know if his blue dads can sing, cook, work, play, and stand on their heads like her dad can. Lou replies, &quot;What funny ideas you have. Do you think dads are different because they are blue.&quot; The message is quite clear; blue dads, or gay dads, experience family life similar to white, black, or heterosexual dads.   Alyson Press has recommended this book to children as young as two years old. I question whether or not very young children will be able to separate the blueness of the fathers to actually understand that having two dads is as &quot;normal&quot; as having one. I suggest introducing this book to a three or four year old who is better able to understand the humor in having blue or green dads. The illustrations are eye catching, include diversity in many areas and display the fathers in many cross gender activities.	1998-01-04

Clearly Asha is devastated because she believes she, her brother, and her two mums are a family, and she wants to go on the trip.   The next day, Asha tries to explain her family. This provokes discussion among the children abut whether or not a child can have two mums. One child says her parents told her that having two mothers living together is bad. While the class is in gym, Asha's mums have a talk with the teacher to clarify their family structure. Asha is able to go on the trip and the other children are informed that both of her mums are important to her. This books makes an important statement: children from gay- and lesbian-headed households do not always make distinctions between their parents such as the &quot;real&quot; mother or father. Parents are frequently distinguished most commonly by names, such as &quot;Mama&quot; and Mom&quot; or &quot;Papa&quot; and &quot;Daddy.&quot;   ASHA'S MUMS is one of a few books which raises the issue of children's families not being accepted or represented in the classroom. It also highlights the difficulties children of gay and lesbian families encounter when their parents have not disclosed their family structure to the school or teacher. Some readers may feel a little uneasy that it was initially left up to Asha and some of her friends to defend and explain her family structure. Still, this may very well be the reality for some children from gay- and lesbian-headed families, especially as parents are not yet aware of the need to explain their family until a &quot;crisis&quot; occurs.   The wonderful illustrations add tothe beauty of the story. They portray Black, Asian, Latino/a and European-American children. This story  works well with a discussion on exclusion, acceptance and diverse family structures.	1998-01-04

It is the story of a weekend spent by Jenny, her father and her father's partner, Eric. On Friday Jenny and her dad throw a surprise birthday party for Eric. They invite Jenny's mum, who often comes over to visit her and her two fathers. On Saturday morning Jenny looks through a book and has breakfast in bed with her fathers and then they go out into the garden. On Sunday they all clean the house and do the laundry. While both men are pulling Jenny back home in a cart, they run into a woman who wishes that gays would &quot;...stay at home so the rest of us don't have to see you. Ugh!&quot;   Jenny is bothered and confused by the woman's comments. Eric explains that being gay is when two men love and live with each other. He goes on to explain the woman's behavior by saying that when people don't understand something or are told it is wrong, they get scared and angry. Using chalk to illustrate, he tells Jenny a story about a woman who disapproves of homosexual love until it is explained to her by her husband, who once loved another man. As Jenny is getting ready for bed she asks if her fathers can have babies. Eric explains that only men and women can have babies.   The portrayal of Jenny's family will be familiar to children who live in a gay-headed household. Jenny's mother seems to have a role in the family that is unlike any of the other books which deal with this subject. There is a relationship between Jenny and her mother and between the mother and Eric and Martin. &quot;Living nearby is Jenny's mum, Karen. She often comes to visit them.&quot; The original relationship between Martin and Karen is not made clear in the text.   The black and white photos illustrate how the two men care for Jenny, each other, and their home in a variety of circumstances. The events that occur in the story (for example, holding the birthday party, doing the laundry, cleaning the house together, solving conflicts between parents) are familiar to all children and their families. Jenny's father's attempt to explain homophobia to her was simple, to the point, and successful.   There are several issues about this book which must be addressed. One issue  which can provoke powerful, almost visceral reactions from many adults is the photo of Jenny in bed with her two fathers, one of whom, though under blanket or pillow, appears to be in the nude. JENNY LIVES WITH ERIC AND MARTIN was authored in Sweden, translated in England and distributed in this country by Alyson Press. The difference in cultural practices and values may attribute to the seeming nonchalance in displaying such a photo in a children's book. The inclusion of this scene may make some adults uncomfortable, or for those individuals in families or cultures which are more open about their bodies, this book may be a nice addition to other story books about families. This frequently intense reaction is unfortunate because the book itself is one of the best in terms of the naturalness of being gay, being a parent and being a child who has gay parents.   The books long length and detailed text make it more appropriate for children ages six and older.	1998-01-04

Will is turning seven years old and has asked his mother and her partner, Jeanne, for a dog for the past four years. Unfortunately, he has asthma. To his surprise he is given a stuffed dog which he cherishes because he is able to sleep with it, take it to the park to meet other dogs, take it on the school bus, and hide it in his school locker. While at school he is teased by some &quot;bullies&quot; and his dog is thrown up a tree. Miraculously, the dog falls in his arms after he has called to it. His mom and Jeanne are surprised to hear what happens and repeat what Will has heard many times before, &quot;Everyone is different. When you don't mind your difference it stops being a problem and becomes your distinction.&quot;   The story has a lot of text and is most appropriate for children ages five and older. The illustrations, hand colored black and white photographs, depict wonderful scenes of home life, i.e. eating dinner, trips to the park and bedtime rituals. His family structure is explained and visually depicted, but not a negative aspect of the story. We get a glimpse of what school life is like for Will as he encounters the school bullies, an experience many children perhaps can relate to. Also familiar to many children is the frustration of living with asthma. Will is unable to join in a school ritual of running around the room while the others sing happy birthday to him, he is teased because he cannot play ball and towards the end is coughing and running out of breath after his interactions with the bullies. Unfortunately, asthma is not explained or discussed in a way that will help others understand what it is or why he has it and Will is depicted as a sad and lonely child because of asthma.	1998-01-04

While the third grade class is making Father's Day cards, Jasmine reveals that her dads are gay. This seems to be the first time the class is made aware of this information. Word of Jasmine's family gets to Michael's fifth grade class where he hears about the incident. Michael, who wants this information kept secret, is taunted by his fifth grade classmates about his fathers until Noah announces that if his dads are gay that's &quot;his private business.&quot; The two boys are teased about possibly being gay themselves and they walk away from the situation, clearly upset and embarrassed.   Over dinner the children talk to their fathers about the incident in school. Jasmine feels that she should be able to tell people if she wants, but Michael feels very strongly that his family structure should be kept secret. The fathers speak to the children about respecting each others' decisions and decide to speak to the principal of the school. (It is interesting that this story highlights the way in which peoples lives are so intertwined that an individual acting on her behalf can affect the lives other others in intense ways.)   Also during dinner, Noah describes the situation to his mother. While Noah had come to Michael's defense in the school yard, he tells his mother that he felt he had to &quot;since we're gay too.&quot; His mother explains that, just because she is gay, Noah may or may not be gay himself. Noah's mother also decides to speak to the principal. As a result, a school assembly is planned to talk about family diversity where gay and lesbian families are included.   This book addresses various issues which are prevalent in all families, including individual versus family privacy, teasing, sticking up for someone, feeling alone, and school/family support. It is important to note that there is little mention of the children's mother. Instead the focus on the two children living with their fathers, helps to validate the experiences of many children in gay-headed households who have no or little contact with their biological mother. Also, for older children, the difficulty and pain of being teased because of their parents' sexual orientation is an important contribution is addressed head-on by this book. It should be noted that the focus of this particular book is on the difficulties and problems of being in gay families and how these problems get solved.   Both of the families discussed in the story are people of color. The families live in average homes and the story takes place in home and school settings. There is no added detail which can take away from the experiences of an &quot;average family.&quot; This story is most appropriate for children age nine and older. Some of the issues addressed are of little concern to young children.	1998-01-04

She and Daniel, both about ten years old, discover with the help of one of Daniel's mothers and a garden cared for by his other mother that people, like flowers, are different. All people have special needs which make each one quite beautiful and unique. Belinda comes to realize that her body belongs to her and that it is okay to look and be different from others.  Although the focus of this story is Belinda's growing understanding of the beauty of differences (some people are short, some of us are tall, some are dark, some are light, some are fat and some are thin), other messages are communicated as well. The author has addressed sex-role stereotypes when Daniel describes some of the things they both enjoy doing, such as playing dress-up, hide-and-seek, playing catch and riding their bikes. Other messages communicated are: Daniel lives with two mothers; the importance of nutrition and growth; one's body, even those of children, are private and that it is unjust for adults to tease children because of their differences.<br /><br />BELINDA'S BOUQUET is one of a few books which doesn't use the parents' sexual orientation as the focus of the story. So, the fact that Daniel lives with his two mothers, that no father figure is part of the family, and most importantly, that his family structure doesn't seem to pose a problem for him, his friends, his school or the driver of the bus who tells Belinda she has gotten fatter, is a genuine plus. The beautiful house and garden which belong to Daniel and his mothers will resonate most personally to the child who either has or lives in what many children refer to as the &quot;country house.&quot;<br /><br />BELINDA'S BOUQUET features color illustrations, is appropriate for children age three and older, and can assist adults who wish to discuss the various issues Newman raises in this book.	1998-01-04

Gloria begins her narrative with a description of some of the events that occur during such celebrations as Valentine's Day, Halloween, Hanukkah, and Mother's Day. She then recounts the events, colors, people and families who make up Gay Pride Day. She finds this celebration as enjoyable as the other holidays.   Various issues are discussed throughout the book and several implicit messages are conveyed. One of the messages which may or may not be explicit to adults and children is that anyone can be gay. One of Gloria's moms, for instance, holds a more traditional woman's job as a nurse while the other is a mechanic. At the parade, Gloria sees many familiar faces, such as her female mail carrier, male music teacher and the male nurse who works with her mother and who is there with his toddler son. The primary message of this story is that &quot;love is the most important thing of all.&quot;   The book raises the issue of homophobia by including people by the side of the parade holding signs which says, &quot;Gays go away.&quot; One of Gloria's mothers explains to her that some people don't think two women or two men should love each other, but that the parade is held to help ensure that people can have a choice. Although that message is appropriate and clarifies that being gay is an adult's choice, it somehow removes the issue from the direct experiences of a young child. It also does not acknowledge that youth may feel and be gay themselves. In addition, homophobic responses and attitudes may be experienced by children raised by gay and lesbian parents. As a way to counter much of the real-world homophobia, the author has included people in Gloria's life who, whether they are gay or not, are supportive of her family structure (the owner of a restaurant they frequent and their shoe salesperson, for instance).   The book contains black and white illustrations and is recommended for children ages three to seven. The length of the book is appropriate for threes and the events Gloria experiences are familiar to many children who have gone to parades and, specifically, to the Gay Pride Parade.	1998-01-04

Jeff has a lot to feel good about because of the four days out of the week he spends with his dads, they always find exciting things to do like hiking, farming, horseback riding, or taking trips to the zoo. Jeff's best friends, Chad and Kim, don't feel as lucky as Jeff because they have only one dad each. Jeff generously loans out his dads, sometimes to Kim and other times to Chad. One day he loans both other dads out on the same day and is left alone.   In the space of only four lines, we are told that Jeff lives with his mother on unspecified number of days out of the week, and with his two fathers the remaining time. The accompanying illustration gives a profile of the mother. Each page is filled with illustrations and verses which add more detail to the characters. Kim, who is Asian, loves baseball and is a Little League catcher. Chad, portrayed as a Black or Latino child, enjoys trips to the zoo and playing checkers. The author has nicely displayed children engaging in cross-gender play.   Kim and Chad's fathers are too busy to play with them, but one of Jeff's dads are always around. As the story continues, we get a glimpse of some of the activities Jeff and his fathers engage in: farming, because one of his dads knows a farmer; the zoo; swimming; horseback riding; camping and carnivals. These are all activities which may not be in the experiences of children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly those who live in urban areas.   Although a bulk of the story focuses on Jeff and his fathers, some further explanation would help the reader better understand this situation than the lines which read, &quot;He moves in with Joe and with Pete, and his friends think his system's a hard one to beat.&quot; For children living everyday with their gay parents the experience of &quot;moving in&quot; with their father(s) on weekends would not directly speak to them. For others, who are the subjects of joint custody arrangements, the book may offer an important legitimization of their lives. The black and white illustrations depict great details in the characters and glimpses of their elaborate homes. The verses are fun to read and the message is quite clear that having two dads is something to feel good about. The book is most suitable for children ages four and older.	1998-01-04

Here, Newman focuses on the divorce of Frankie's two moms. The author and illustrator depict the events that follow the divorce, i.e. one parent moving and Frankie visiting her, the particular emotions that are felt when a child is separated from a loved one and how this young child is comforted and loved by both parents. Although the sadness is felt, there is also a strong sense that Frankie, and his moms, will be OK.   Similar to HEATHER HAS TWO MOMMIES and GLORIA GOES TO GAY PRIDE, the story is about a white family and the illustrations of other people help to support diversity, i.e. girls playing basketball and children/adults of color in the park. This book would be appropriate for even a three year old who has had a similar experience as Frankie and would be most helpful in a classroom curriculum on family.	1998-01-04

This is perhaps the only book dealing with the history of the movement, but much of it seemed impersonal. I am not sure if Benkov's target audience is lesbian and gay parents and their supporters, or if the book is supposed to be a way to convince those opposed to the movement. All in all though, it was an enjoyable and informative book, and it is a must read for anyone interested in this subject	1997-08-27

However it was somewhat hampered by several problems I had in reading the story. The novel is written in the present tense, in the form of a letter to Pagan's dead mother, Candida. This grew to be confusing because of the repeated switches in the time period. Many time I was confused about what was going on. Also, I think the book at 400 plus pages was too long. It could have easily been cut down 100 pages or so without losing any of the story. Despite its short-comings, I enjoyed the novel a great deal and thought it had a very good plot and it was compelling enough for me to read in two sittings	1997-08-22

If you are an average American this book will open your eyes to the extremes of the Right-wing in this country. This book is undoubtably one of the most important books ever written about the far-Right in American life today. The author takes a hard, uncompromising book at Pat Robertson, leader of the Christian Coalition. It clearly outlines the group's theocratic agenda and exposes some of the darker sides of Pat Robertson and his followers. This book is meant to be a warning to Americans. There is a determined group of people out there who are dedicated to destroying the separation of church and state, curtailing individual freedoms, and imposing theocratic rule on American life. Please get informed about this issue. The future of America depends on people willing to take a stand for the true American way	1997-07-20

The book is a careful examination of the political situations surrounding the gay and evangelical communities and their similarities and differences.
