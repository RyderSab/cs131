Yes, the pastry is fragile, but, my god, it's delicious -- buttery (but not greasy), flaky, slightly sweet. No more thick, heavy, greasy crusts from other cookbooks!<br />The recipes for the various tarts are wonderful and unique and the pictures beautiful. But, the bottom line is, you should buy this book for the pastry recipe alone.	2004-06-28

Oftentimes, off-shoot books like these are dismal failures as others attempt to capitalize upon the popularity of successful publications.  The Little House Cookbook is most definitely an exception; the author obviously put a lot of thought, effort and research into creating this book, which provides detailed background and historical information in addition to recreations of foods from the Little House Series.  My mom first gave me this book when I was a little girl and I still pull it of the shelf 15 years later to read.<br />Chapters cover a wide variety of categories, from staples from the country store, to foods from the wild, to foods from the barnyard and sweets.  Learn how to make cheese (from the Big Woods), butter, sourdough bread, cracklings, blackbird pie and vinegar pie.  I honestly don't think any foods from the LH series have been left out.  The author almost always includes a passage from the series for each recipe.  Illustrations from the original series are also included.  Highly, highly recommended, particularly if you're interested in foods from the frontier area or are just an avid LH fan.	2003-07-23

I certainly wouldn't call this book terribly well-written, but it does provide some interesting details about a childhood spent in India.  Descriptions of visits to her grandparents house in South India, the milkman who brings along his cow every morning, and delicious-sounding foods that were prepared during certain seasons all make this book worth reading.  It goes quickly downhill, however, after the author moves to America and describes her formation as an artist and eventual arranged marriage (not as interesting as you might imagine).  The author should have focused more on her childhood memories in India rather than turning the book into a vague biography that becomes downright boring by the end, with random descriptions of various family visits in America.	2003-04-28

I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above.  The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food.  If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few.	2003-04-28

I had high hopes for this book and, while some of the stories were interesting, the book left me feeling unsatisfied.  Most of the time it seem that the author ran across poor-tasting pies and, at other times, she failed to get recipes for the good ones, both of which were extremely frustrating.  Even if she was unable to obtain the exact recipes for the peach pie and the white bean pie she describes, I felt that she should have put some effort towards obtaining good ones.  Also, at one point, someone mentioned where she could get the &quot;best&quot; kind of a certain pie, but she refused to go out of her way to drive there (I believe this was an apple pie in Texas)!  I readily tired of her constant natter about how good, homemade pie is a disappearing art in America -- a trite comment that really only needed to be mentioned once.	2002-07-15

I loved the descriptions of food and of daily life in a French town. Loomis really makes moving to France sound tempting and not terribly complicated. However, I wondered about their long-term plans, which she didn't discuss in the book: is her family thinking about ever returning to the US? will their children be schooled in the French school system until college or will they go to a bilingual school or international school? I also found it interesting, after a web search, that Loomis has started a cooking school at her home...Overall, I enjoyed this book just as much as \\"A Year in Provence\\". The latter is funnier and probably better written, but I preferred On Rue Tatin's focus on cooking and homelife (i.e., what it is like to have a baby in France).	2001-08-03

It includes pound cake bakeries, chocolates shops (i.e., a Dutch one in Des Moines), spice houses, and a lot more. There is so much in this book, you are bound to find a lot of things you'd be interested in trying. The only fault I think it has is that it is bound to become outdated quickly. I know that the Schazarad Bakery (one of the last bakeries to make phyllo dough by hand) is already out of business or is soon to be (unless someone has decided to buy it or carry it on). However, this is a minor fault and will most likely not effect most of the entries in the book.	2001-07-02

I made the sour cream chocolate cupcakes, but put on the quick caramel frosting, and they were out of this world! Seriously -- I've made them three times now and can't get enough. That icing is awesome. I originally made the cupcakes with the sour cream chocolate frosting, but found it to be too thin. Also, the yellow mix recipes don't cover the flavor of cake mix very well. Plus, the texture is still spongey and compact, unlike the chocolate recipes.<br />The chocolate peanut butter bars are also awesome. I think the recipes are just pretty much hit or miss. The good ones are great and the bad ones still taste like cake mix (if not worse because you're expecting something so much better!!).	2001-02-08

This is a great ice cream book. Personally, I really like the way it has off-beat flavors like corn ice cream (comes with a recipe for sweet corncake), red bean (a good ice cream, by the way), plum, fig, etc. Plus, it has all the regulars like banana, strawberry, etc. Each recipe has a list of variations at the end, too, which expands your repetoire a lot. Also, the author includes Philadelphia-style ice cream (those made without eggs) and custard-style ice cream (which he says are much better, but more complicated).

Please, don't take this book literally! I cannot, nor do I have any  inkling, to do half of what the author suggests -- airing out your bed for  30 minutes everyday? Thorough spring and fall cleanings where EVERY ITEM is  taken out of drawers and cupboards? No way! However, it is nice to know  that this book is available on my shelf if I ever want to do such a thing.  It's a great general reference book. I don't read it as a guide for  day-to-day living -- rather, it a tool I can use to find out whether I  really can wash my goose-down pillows, the best way to clean granite  countertops and stone floors, which fabrics don't actually need to be  dry-cleaned (those dry clean labels don't mean everything has to be taken  to the cleaners; in fact, some of my dry-clean-only  clothes are *much*  cleaner now that I've just thrown them in the wash), etc. Yes, I would love  to live in a home that was spotless and where the sheets were freshly  washed and ironed every single day, but I can't and I don't let this book  make me feel as if I should be a slave to housecleaning in order to live  properly.	2000-09-09

First of all, a lot of the recipes are repeats from &quot;The Best Recipe.&quot; For example, the intro to the  apple pie recipe is copied practically verbatim from the one in Best  Recipe, except that Kimball substitutes &quot;I&quot; for &quot;we&quot;,  as if it was only himself, on his Vermont farm, who tested all those apples  and techniques (maybe it was, but, please, get your story straight from one  cookbook or the other!). Secondly, I was expecting more of a warm, fuzzy  feeling when reading this book about an old &quot;yellow farmhouse&quot;.  Instead, I got passages about hunting, the local store which has an eating  area in the back with magazines about nude girls on motorcycles and bumper  stickers that read &quot;my kid beat up your honors student&quot;, field  hands, a dark and dingy sounding farmhouse, and narrative about how  gym-going &quot;city people&quot;  are really so much weaker than real  dyed-in-the-wool Vermont country hicks. The recipes may be good, but the  commentary is not what I expected at all. Kimball seems completely  pre-occupied (maybe he has a complex?) about real Vermonters -- he cooks up  meals for all the local farmhands on his weekends in Vermont and can't say  enough good things about everything and anything they do. Well, the way  Kimball describes them, they all sound like rednecks to me...	2000-08-28

I am SO glad I bought this book; it covers a huge range of food and gives  in-depth discussion as to why the editors chose the particular recipe they  did. Even if you don't agree with the final result, it is still  fascinating, although I admit that the way it's written makes the editors  sound a little slow witted. Each recipe seems to have taken weeks to  develop -- the testers never managed to hit a great recipe on the first or  even fifth try... Nevertheless, it is immensely enjoyable. For instance,  the introduction on fried chicken discusses whether to soak it or not, what  to soak the raw chicken in (buttermilk, water, milk?), what to dredge it  in, how long to let it sit after dredging, what kind of fat to fry it in  (peanut oil, lard, vegie oil, crisco?), what perfect temperature to fry at  to minimize grease absorbtion (the authors note that chicken fried in  crisco only absorbed 1 tsp.) and whether to cover the pan or not while it's  cooking. Whew! The editors also discuss various types of chocolate chips  (most testers preferred a supermarket brand, not an exotic French brand,  because that's what most grew up with, the authors surmise). From layer  cakes to ham and split pea soup to pasta salad to BBQ, most basic dishes  are covered. I eat ethnic food most of the time and this book still  appealed to me, probably because the recipes appear to be delicious. By the  way, the seasonings are NOT limited to salt and pepper, but include various  spices. Many recipes have variations included at the end.	2000-08-22

The oven-fried chicken is delicious, although I might marinate the chicken before cooking b/c it doesn't taste very good cold! There are also many anecdotes about the Amish and old-fashioned recipes such as Brown Sugar Pie, Buttermilk Pie, Burnt Sugar Cake, Butterscotch Tapioca Pudding, BBQ Chicken, Onion Rivel Soup, Homemade Grape Nuts, and so much more.

Rachel Laudan definitely seems to cover a the broad  array of unique goodies that can be found in Hawaii; for instance, Hawaii  is the ONLY place to truly appreciate shaved ice and the potential myriad  of delicious flavors. Unfortunately, however, the recipes don't quite live  up to expectation. I can remember one of my earliest memories in Hawaii --  I had made friends w/ another little girl at the beach and her family  invited me to share in their cooked-at-the-beach lunch of steamed rice and  teriyaki beef. It was sooo good and not something that my mom cooked for ME  at the beach! I've been looking to re-create that taste and memory for a  while and Rachel Laudan's teriyaki recipe falls far, far short. Her butter  mochi recipe is also very heavy and greasy for my tastes (and I love  mochi). Nevertheless, it's a fascinating account of Hawaiian cooking. I  just wish the recipes were excellent, too.	2000-08-11

This book has a multitude of cake mix cakes -- the Banana and Cannoli cakes sound particularly yummy. The author also covers coffee cakes, those really down home favorites (such as Pig Pickin Cake, made with mandarin  oranges and pistachio pudding in the frosting), and quite a few yummy  chocolate cakes including Peppermint, Almond, and Mississippi Mud. She also  DOES include basic yellow and white cakes at the end of the book (telling  you to add a full stick of butter and whole eggs and milk). And she also  specifically tells you which cakes to use &quot;pudding in the mix&quot;  mixes for and which ones not to (pudding in the mix tends to make the cake  very wet) and I feel this is easy to comply with since both types of mixes  are available at the store.<br />However, the book does miss some  yummy-sounding cake mix recipes that I've found such as Jello Poke Cake,  Coconut Poke Cake (made by pouring condensed milk &amp; cream of coconut on  top of the hot cake) and Watergate Cake (these are the cakes that make cake  mixes fun, in my opinion). I thought this book--with its myriad of  recipes--would be all-inclusive. I also wish there were more indulgent-type  cakes such as the Banana w/ Caramel Frosting. Too many are  bundt/coffee-type cakes which aren't as appealing in a cake mix form to me.	2000-06-08

There isn't really much of a plot, but if you are  interested in the details of daily farm life during this period from a  young child's point of view, it is a fantastic read. It gives a lot more  detail than the other Little House books and, along the way, describes such  things as butter-making, &quot;breaking&quot; horses and cattle, Sunday  dinner, clothes-making, shearing wool, ice-cream making, planting crops,  going to school, etc... While this may sound boring, it's actually quite  colorful and entertaining.

It has a great many basics, which I have never learned how to cook. I see it as a good general cookbook. The spinach pie, soups, scones, and granola all  look fabulous. The fruit tart I baked was terrific! Unfortunately, my  coconut cupcakes did NOT turn out so well. Since so many have raved about  them, this must be my fault, I guess. They tasted like heavy muffins,  rather than light cupcakes, probably because I tried reducing the 3 sticks  of butter to 2 and 1/2 (I'll have to try again without tinkering).

I think I'll wait  until I can get to Fauchon in Paris to try his creations, though. Also,  there aren't pictures for every dessert, which is a little annoying when  the recipes are so involved.

Unfortunately, while my tastes do run to homemade cakes, the recipes in this book were simply way too buttery for me. The All-American Yellow cake  tasted like a very light version of Sara Lee frozen pound cake (it even had  the same color and crust texture). I guess I prefer my layer cake to not  taste so overly vanilla-ish and buttery. Also, I'm not a fan of  buttercream, which is not the same thing as regular American frosting made  with butter, powdered sugar, and cream. I made the Strawberry Buttercream  for my cake, but it tasted just like flavored butter to me (might be good  on toast). If your tastes run to this sort of thing, the Cake Bible might  be a good investment. There are a lot of cakes, including several chocolate  and a country buttermilk cake and a lot of recipes for fillings, meringues,  and whipped cream. Also, she has a different recipe for genoise that  supposedly works well, even for those who have never had success with  genoise. This book is also helpful if you want to learn to make European  cakes--i.e., those with dacquoise, genoise, syrups, meringues, and other  sponge-type batters. Otherwise, I'd stick to a traditional American cake  book!	2000-04-14

The pastry cream was very thick (due to a lot of cornstarch) and not as flavorful as the pastry cream in \\"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook\\"; also, the crust for the fruit tart needed to be baked a lot longer than the 20 minutes called for.<br />More recently, I made the Florentine cookies and the results were horrendous! Gayle has you cook the cookie mixture way too long so that the cookies will not spread in the oven.  After throwing the dough away, I found a Florentine recipe in my Fannie Farmer Baking Book and the cookies turned out excellent (cooking times were very different from Gayle's).	2000-03-23
