Her job in Loyalty in Death?  To find Cassandra and to put an end to the bombings.  <br />After nine books and one novella, I found  that Eve and Roarke's story has slowed slightly, and I might have been  disappointed if LID hadn't presented such a great sub-story for Peabody.   Her brother's visit gives us an opportunity to know more about Eve's aide,  and watching Peabody's romantic interest develop was  wonderful, even  though it was expected.  Nine books is a long time to sustain a group of  core characters and keep them interesting, and yet, that's just what JD  Robb (Nora Roberts) has managed to do.  I find myself anxious to see what  new character growth each book will present.	1999-10-20

Since then I've backlisted almost all her books, but rather than read them all, stuffing myself like a choco-holic who's found a box of Godivas, I treat myself to them, one at a time.  And, let me tell you, Kiss an Angel  was a treat. I'm used to SEP's sports heros, have fallen in love with them  even, but Alex Markov made me long for a ticket to the circus.  Watching  him try to tame Daisy Deveroux was a treat.  You see, he didn't understand  Daisy at all.  Like everyone else, Alex didn't have a clue who the stranger  he married really was.  Daisy might look like a spoiled, rich, ball of  fluff, but as Alex starts to look closer he discovers a woman whose keen  mind is only rivalled by her capacity to love.  Watching this seemingly  unlikely pair turn into a match made in heaven was a delight.  SEP's sense  of humor is only rivaled by her ability to touch her reader's heart.	1999-08-06
