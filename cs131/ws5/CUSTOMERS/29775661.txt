The hero I felt we didn't really get to know that well, her usual Hero's have more play it seemed to me. Also, this story seemed very predicable in comparison to her creative twists.  <br /> Considering how much I adore her writing this wasn't that bad. I just don't think it was her best. The next book that takes after this one looks like it will be a step up. This book followed tradition in the sense that her background characters shined in it. <br /> I thought the vampire idea was fabulous and  she did it just right.	2005-09-08

So naturally I had to go get the next book. I was disappointed in the fact she didn't use  a original fictional character like Hannah, but never the less it was pretty good. Her description of the Tudor ear is beautifully written. I thought that Amy wasn't as constantans as her attitude had been in the first one. It was interesting to see all the different viewpoints of how people saw  Robert. As a finial note some of it did seem to drag on and the plot was driven by this one piece of mysterious history that she really wanted to point out. Don't get me wrong it was interesting, but certain parts were dry.	2005-09-06

It has a solid story and the supporting characters you learn to care about. 2. It is a nice romance 3. It has its unexpected twists. Bad points: 1. The whole good twin bad twin thing...wasn't realistic. 2. The heroine was annoying (I mean hiding your beauty so your sister won't get jealous?

The characters were rich but I found that sometimes they seemed almost to contradict themselves . Other characters in the background also, were given more play then they should and some weren't given enough. I have to give this book fourstars even though I would give it a 3.5 because the beginning was slow and certain parts were longer than necessary.

Yet colin the &quot;Hero&quot; is just wacko. some parts your like he is so hot other parts your like ewh creep. this book was very interesting in how she relates the future with the past, yet you wished she would have done it more.  I do recommend this book, yet when I think about it the male was very disturbing. The main thing is to read this book, even if some of the logic is twisted.	2003-08-09

I know; it was one of her earlier ones....but still. This started off ok. But, the guy is old enough to be her grandad. He also, is a fool and a raper. Unless you want to read a sad book that breaks a strong willed women who gets ruined by her hero then by all means read this said story. It is entertaining, yet you want to throw the book, or flush it down a toilet once your done it. I have this to say to Conn- boys can be boys, men can't	2003-07-21

I found the beg. humorous and exciting. The whole time she was ugly the book was great. Yet she tarnishes herself so much its strange. Austyn who is a great guy turns evil. He bares her basically in her birthday suit in front of everyone. He also just treats her like (...)!! I really felt sorry for Holly she didn't deserve him and he shouldn't have ever gotten her. I feel that if you like a dumb hero read this one because the guys a fool and the girl isn't that much better for gettin with him.	2003-07-21
