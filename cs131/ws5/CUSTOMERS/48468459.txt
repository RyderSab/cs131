I didn't understand any of it.  The short story makes absolutely no sense at all.  It is one big almost orgie.  I found it frustrating and left me confused.  I won't bother with any of her other works if this is what they are like.<br /><br />The remaining stories were uninteresting really and barely memoriable.  Although I did find a couple of small chuckles mixed in them.  MaryJanice Davidson's Dead Girls Don't Dance would have to have been the most amusing of the three only because of the airhead, queen of the undead.	2004-10-12

It has since become a favorite at our house.  We have fun making the noises toghether.  In fact, she can now repeat all of the noises and can even apply them to other pictures.  The rhythem of the book is easy and fun.  A great choice for parents.	2004-04-18

The story starts out with Julie talking about her brother's death and how he was in her arms when he died.  After that her father is taken ill and almost off of the work on the family farm falls onto her shoulders.  She works so hard and resents so much, that she ends up marring Hank when she is only 17.  <br />They move to Gap Creek where things only get harder.  Hank looses his job, Julie is pregnant.  <br />The book is beautifully written and tragic, but also very heart warming as Julie and Hank learn to lean on each other and over come tragedy and heartbreak.  It is a wonderful inspiration to how a marriage can grow and become stronger.	2003-09-15

I am also not a huge fan of fantasy romance, but I thought I would give this book a try since I like so many of the author's previous books I had read.<br />The story revolves around Dalden and Brittany.  Dalden, a warrior from a barbarric planet far off in space has come to Earth to capture an evil villian set on world domination (a little bit cliche there).  He enlists Brittany's help in doing this.  The is the beginning of an unrealistic story line.  <br />After Brittany and Dalden capture the bad guy, Dalden kidnaps Brittany to take her back to his home planet.  For months Brittany refuses to believe any of this is real and that she is part of some secret government experiment to test her intelligence.  The story just become silly at this point.  <br />The ending is anti-climactic after chapters of disbelief, Brittany majically believes all in the span of a couple of pages.  I sure wouldn't use this book as a judge of the author's talents.	2003-09-15

I admit to being disappointed when she switched to suspense romance though.  Her newer books (Mercy, Heartbreaker) lack the sense of humor she had in the historical pieces.  In fact, the humor was the reason I so enjoyed her books.  For the first time Ms. Garwood has included that humor in her suspense novels.  <br />I enjoyed Killjoy, though as with other reviewers I was disappointed also with the ending.  After the huge build-up, the ending left a lot to be desired, the reader is just left hanging.  <br />Avery Delaney is an FBI analyst.  For a woman that is perceived to be so brilliant in the begining she really does fizzle when her own life is in danger.  The hero, is fairly predictable.  He like all heros is a loner with deep emotional scars.  He is the typical macho man who saves the day.<br />The plot is complicated and the villian just too warped for words.  Jilly, the supposedly dead mother of Avery has returned for revenge.  She is delusional and apparently so beautiful that every man she ever meets falls hopelessly in love with her.  Jilly concocts a complicated scheme to kill Avery and her aunt.  Of course the plans to wrong and she and her accomplice struggle to find a way to kill them before being caught.<br />I found the dialog between Avery and John Paul witty and it reminded me of many of her earlier works.  Hince the reference to the humor.  This is the first of her contemporary novels that I have truely enjoyed and hope she continues to improve in this area.	2003-09-04

The story simply does not flow well and the words are different from what I remember as a child.  This is a minor thing except the chorus is only printed on the front page and then the book only prints what the little ant does.  I find it distracting to have to remember the rest of the song's words to get to the littles one's part.  The Hokey Pokey is a much better choice.	2003-08-19

However, I made an exception for this book.  My 20 month old daughter really likes this book.  She loves to look at other babies, and loves Barnie.  I didn't find it very good though.  Half the book is Barney, half baby pictures.  Baby Einstein has much better books with baby pictures that I think are better pictures, are more engaging and I find with this book there is really nothing for us to talk about since she is so distracted by Barney.	2003-08-19

I finished five and it had to have been one of the biggest literary let downs I have ever experienced.  I am not saying it was bad, but it sure wasn't up to snuff with the last two.  <br />With book four there was this driving need to continue reading to see if Harry will make it or to find out what will happen next.  With five, I kept reading waiting for the adventure to begin.  It never really does.  The story is slow, confusing and conveluted.  Rawlings spends so much time leading up to the battle that she fails to place the much needed story in to a very long book.  <br />That is not to say that the book is without its entertaining moments.  Most of them provided by the Weasley twins at the expense of Professer Umbridge.  They were in fact the most entertinaing parts of the book.  <br />Harry has become an increasingly angry and disturbed young man, but I think that actually gives him a great deal more depth than he would have otherwise.  It is much easier to relate to a young man that is angry at the world, and in Harry's case with reason.  <br />After reading the authors interviews about the difficulty she had killing off a character I was surprised to find it was [...]The death of a character does go to show a more realistic approach from the author.  No one would believe a great battle between good and evil would end in no one's death but Valdemort's.<br />I have not decided if I will bother to purchase the next book.  this one was such media hype and very little substance that I wonder if it will be worth my money.  Rawlings left readers hanging with this book, the major battle that was expected simply never came and I wonder how much longer she will be able to continue the story.  I am not sure if there are to be six or seven books in the series, but I don't think the author could pull off more than one more at this point.  Perhaps she brought Valdemort to life too soon.	2003-08-19

It took her a couple of reads to get into it, but she soon fell in love.  It is now read as often and the Lady Bug book.  The story is short, simple and fun to read, although when tired the last couple of pages can be a bit of a tongue twister for mom.  It is an excellent story to teach color giving it a good educational value and the nice thing is it is a good bedtime story.  It is very calm and relaxing so we now alternate this book with Goodnight Moon, which I was tired of reading.  Really a very good choice for a toddler book.  Note however, this is not a board book and the pages while thick are easily torn.	2003-08-19

We read it frequently and from the look of it you can see it is well loved.  The babies are fun to look at and the words are appropriate for very young infants and toddlers that have short attention spans.  I would say this book is a must for anyone with an infant just learning to listen to stories.  It will stay around for a long time.	2003-08-19

I really like the concept of the book.  But, I think the author spent way too much time spewing about her hatred for George Bush and her alcholism.  I think it was just distracting.  I wanted to read about her son and most of it was about other stuff.  I did like how honestly she reported her feelings on her son though.  It was nice to see I was not the only one that ever thought they might hate their child.  I probably wouldn't recommend the book to anyone simply because it wasn't what I thought it would be.	2003-08-19

However, we have to skip a few pages because it is a little too long for younger toddlers.  The actions for the most part are things children can act out themselves, however there are a few pages that don't correspond well to human body parts (I haven't figured out yet how to light my tail).  The book does a great job of getting my daughter up and moving and we have fun reading it together.  <br />The bugs are also a nice touch.  We have several Wee Sing books and I suspect as my daughter matures this one will replace Hokey Pokey as her favorite.	2003-08-19

I was a little disappointed in that aspect.  It was however an interesting read if you can take it for what it is, Hilary Martin's expereinces with the military.  I have been married to my husband for five years now.  I laughed at a lot of the things she wrote because we have gone through them also.  The book is filled with Ms. Martin's sarcastic sense of humor, by the way, if you don't understand sarcasm you probably won't find the book funny.  <br />I really though this would be a book on benefit and rules.  It isn't, there is actually very little content of that form.  It is instead a glimps at one woman's life and how she coped with life in the military.  Now don't get me wrong, there are some practical aspects of the book also.  She does include a few reference sections that are useful such as the deployment chapter and the relocation lists.  I also find the author's sharing of her personal financial problems a nice way of illustrating the credit traps many military familys find themselves in.  <br />If you are looking for information on what military life is like, I think this is a good option.  The author very accurately portrays the sense of frustration and anger many young military wives feel.  Probably not very useful to a woman who already has a good idea of what the military is about.	2003-07-16

I admit this.  My home is an explosion of toys, cracker crumbs, laundry and paperwork.  Our bills are regularly late because we can't find them or worse forget about them.  I would like to say this book re-invented my life, I have to be realistic though.  After almost 30 years of disorganization nothing will change over night.  The author does offer some very practical simple solutions that I was able to implement with almost no effort.  This was great for us.  I created an organization system and rearranged a few items of furniture to find that I could use the space and things I already owned to my advantage.  I try to look through the book weekly to find something new I can add to our routine to see what we can do to improve things.  If you are just starting out with organization or you are to the point I was where you were ready to explode this is an excellent resource.	2003-07-02

My marriage counselor recommended my husband and I read Men are from Mars Women are from Venus.  When I went to the bookstore to purchase the book I found this one instead.  It looked so much more interesting.  I changed my mind on which one to buy.  <BR>When I went back a few weeks later I discussed the book at length with my counselor and she was really impressed with how much the Waffles and Spaghetti had really helped me.  This was probably the first time I had really understood my husband's need to watch NASCAR.  He has a really stressful job and works six days a week, for the first time I understood why he didn't want to spend the seventh running all over town with me.  <BR>In addition, the Farrels put in some great problem solving tips.  I am also trying really hard to get my husband to agree with some of the other tips they write about including planning weekends and code words.  <BR>There were some things that I did disagree with.  First, I was unaware the book was a faith based publication.  The authors are ministers and spend a lot of time pushing God.  This isn't a bad thing, but I found it distracting at times.  I felt that they were spending too much time telling readers to place everything in God's hands and not enough about doing things for yourself.<BR>I also objected to their statements that a married person shouldn't have a personal conversation one on one with a person of the opposite sex.  Both my husband and I have jobs that require us to spend large amounts of time alone with people of the opposite sex.  Part of his responsibilities require him to probe for personal information and form close contact with men and women of the opposite sex.  The Farrel's seem to believe this will only lead to an affair.  I really have to disagree with that.  <BR>Overall, this book is excellent.  The advice is for the most part practical and I don't think you should expect to agree with everything you read in a self-help book.  I would recommend the book to anyone looking for an insite to the mind of the mind of the opposite sex.	2003-06-05

I became so engrossed with the characters wanting to give Nanny a backbone, comfort Grayer and just knock some sense into the Xes and Ms. Chicago.  I can't wait to pass the book on to a friend I know will love it.	2003-05-16

I could have given her a completely different view of military life. I did not marry my husband young, I have a college degree, I hold a job actually making more than my husband (an E-5) and never have I been more offended. The book does nothing to distroy the stereotypes of military wives and is just offensive.	2003-04-21

Ms. Martin looks at military life from a practical, no nonsense, hard love and humourous approach.  It is really an accurate portrail of what a new wife should expect.	2003-04-21

This is by far my favorite.  The recipes are grouped by category rather than month as in the annual editions which I hate, it makes it hard to browse for a dinner recipe.  One of the best things about this book is it has recipes for everyone from the beginner to the advanced chef.  I can't name the number of times I have used the reference sections also.  The substitution list is the best and I love the introductions and tips listed all over the book.  Where the annual editions are really geared towards an experienced chef this book has so many basic tips that I would strongly recommend it for a beginning chef as well.	2003-04-18

The author takes a no-nonsense, tough love, practical and often humorous approach to military life.  Unlike many other books designed to help military wives learn about thier new lives this one is written in a more personal stile explaining the things one wife learned and wanted to pass onto others.  It is entertaining reading which is more than you can usually say for a manual.	2003-04-18

I learned so much from it.  The recipes were great, but I really thought they took a back seat to the letters and stories listed.  So many of the things I read I want to take back with me to my next family support group meeting.  I am particularly interested in the section Ms. Tillery wrote about the Military Wives Table Setting.  I have looked all over for more information on it and hope to find something soon.  <br />Thank you for taking the time to record our history as so much of the women attached to military endured has been forgotten and overlooked.	2003-04-18

It is a collection of the best recipes from Southern Living over a 20 year period.  How could it not be great.  Also, unlike the annual editions it lists recipes by category making things easier to locate.	2003-04-18

Now at nine months, it is the only book she will sit still for. It is a classic with simple text and beautiful illustrations.  I know that we will be reading for years to come and I will not get tired of it.	2002-09-28
