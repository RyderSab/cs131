The Johns<BR>Hopkins Univ. Press.  1988.  126 pp.<BR>This volume contains a very good Introduction, 6 Hymns (to<BR>Zeus; Apollo; Artemis, Delos; the Bath of Pallas; Demeter);<BR>64 epigrams (short, succinct poetry bites!); and the<BR>Select Fragments (parts of Callimachus's poetry that are<BR>found in bits and pieces in various places, but which have,<BR>unfortunately, not come down to us complete): there is the<BR>more complete, Prologue to &quot;Aetia&quot;; a short fragment from<BR>&quot;Aetia&quot;- itself; 10 fragments from &quot;Victory of Berenike&quot;;<BR>fragments 67 through 75 from &quot;Akontios and Kydippe&quot;; a<BR>longer, more complete piece &quot;The Lock of Berenike&quot;, <BR>fragment &quot;Iambics&quot;; fragment 260 from &quot;Hekale&quot;; Lyric<BR>Fragments from &quot;Brankhos&quot;; &quot;The Deification of Arsinoe&quot;;<BR>and &quot;The All-Night Festival.&quot;  There are Notes for the<BR>various poems from p. 93 - 123.<BR>The translators tell us who Callimachus was by quoting<BR>from the -Suda-, a Byzantine encylopedia: &quot;Callimachus,<BR>son of Battos and Mesatma, of Kyrene, a man of letters...<BR>assiduous enough to have written poems in every meter and<BR>a great number of prose works beside, 800 volumes in all [!].<BR>He lived during the reign of [the Greek imposed line of<BR>rulers of Egypt] Ptolemy Philadelphos [285-247 B.C.E.]<BR>Before his introduction to that king he taught grammar in<BR>Eleusis, a suburb of Alexandria [Egypt].  He survived to<BR>the time of Ptolemy Euergetes [Philadelphos's successor].&quot;<BR>The translators further supply, &quot;We learn from another source<BR>(a scholium in a manuscript of Plautus) that Callimachus<BR>held a royal appointment in the great Library of Alexandria.<BR>Whether he was ever head librarian is a disputed point- he<BR>probably never was- but we do know that he produced a<BR>catalogue, the -Pinakes-, of the Library's holdings.  His<br />celebrated maxim...(&quot;Big Book, big brother&quot;) is probably<BR>to be understood in the context of his work as librarian,<BR>but is in accord with his aesthetic canons as well.&quot;<BR>The importance of Callimachus comes not just from what<BR>he himself wrote, and sadly we now have such a small <BR>portion of, but of his important influence on those poets<BR>who came after him, especially among the Romans.  In his<BR>own time, Callimachus might be viewed by us as a transitional<BR>figure between the modes and forms of ancient Greek poetry<BR>as they are transformed by a new perspective of the<BR>Hellenistic era (after the death of Alexander the Great,<BR>10 June 323 B.C.) The city of Alexandria, Egypt, founded<BR>by Alexander, became a great center of learning, culture,<BR>literary creativity, trade, and cosmopolitan spirit.<BR>Callimachus is a part of that wondrous mixture. The<BR>poetry of Callimachus presents a delicious mixture of<BR>flavors and tones, from the slightly distant Hymns, to<BR>the more immediate epigram complaints over youthful males he<BR>is attracted to (with his sharp complaints over their ways<BR>and wiles), to the tart comments he places in some of<BR>the poems about his critics and the heavy influence upon<BR>him of his researches and learning retentions.<BR>Callimachus, in the hands of the right translators (and<BR>these two are excellent) &quot;comes alive&quot; for us with <BR>immediacy, wit, tartness, clever irony, and very real<BR>moments of revelation.<BR>Here is their haunting translation of the emanation of<BR>the god Apollo: &quot;Don't you see, the Delian/ palm tree<BR>nodded,/ a sudden sweetness, the swan sings in air,/ bolts<BR>slide from the door, the hinges swing/ The god is no longer<BR>far.&quot;<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-03-12

Oxford Univ. Press. 2001.  350 pp.<BR>What sets this volume above the volume asembled by Stanley<BR>Lombardo and Diane Rayor is the quality and presentation<BR>of the commentary. The &quot;Introduction&quot; is fuller and focuses<BR>on Callimachus the poet, in a fashion that challenges <BR>somewhat the &quot;traditional&quot; views of him.  The commentary<BR>on the poems is excellent, as well as the Notes (pp. 186 - <BR>314). This volume takes advantage of the fragments which<BR>were found by Callimachus and attempts to reconstruct<BR>for the reader what the whole must have been like by<BR>giving brief carry-over insertions between the fragments<BR>which we do have. Nisetich also &quot;reconstructs&quot; briefly<BR>certain poems or parts of poems which we do not have from<BR>mentions and quotes of those items in ancient scholarly writers<BR>which we do have. This is immensely helpful and enriching.<br />The contents of the volume are arranged slightly in a<BR>different form and given different title names from those<BR>of other editions. The helpful thing, here again, is that<BR>Nisetich numbers the parts, so we always &quot;know where we<BR>are.&quot;<BR>Those contents are: &quot;Hekale&quot; (with Introduction)- &quot;the<BR>encounter between the young Athenian hero Theseus and <BR>the old woman Hekale&quot;) (58 fragments and interpositions);<BR>Hymns (To Zeus; Apollo; Artemis; Delos (island birthplace<BR>of Apollo); Bath of Pallas(Athena); Demeter); -Aitia 1-2-<BR>(Introduction; Prologue and Dream; Aitia 1, Aitia 2);<BR>Iambi (17); -Aitia 3-4- (Introduction; Aitia 3; Aitia 4);<BR>and Epigrams (Erotic Poems -- 63).<BR>Some helpeful insights supplied by Nisetich in this<BR>wondrous volume: &quot;The best cure for all these and similar<BR>[traditional] distortions is to read the poet himself, free,<BR>as much as possible, from prejudice [an excellent way to<BR>read any writer].&quot; *** &quot;Unpredictability, freshness, <BR>perfection: these are among his qualities. *** Lightness<BR>of touch is perhaps his hallmark, no matter how much weight<BR>he is handling.&quot; *** &quot;The poet has finer calibrations in<BR>mind, and pays heed to them in composition, confident that<BR>his audience will appreciate what he is up to.&quot;<BR>One of his epigrams shows their focus, style, and<BR>Callimachus's personal perspective: Fill the cup: time for<BR>another toast &quot;To Diokles&quot; /and leave the water out!  <BR>His looks (handsome/ all too handsome) demand it neat.<BR>If anyone disagrees,/ I'm the only connoisseur of beauty<BR>here!<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-03-12

The other quote follows some<BR>critical introduction by the editor herself: \\"Tellingly,<BR>Sidney's own persona, Philisides, is described on his first<BR>appearance as diabled by unhappiness: \\"Another young shepherd<BR>named Philisides...had all this time lain upon the ground<BR>at the foot of a cypress tree, leaning upon his elbow, with<BR>so deep a melancholy that his senses carried to his mind no<BR>delight from any of their objects.\\"<BR>But these poems rarely dwell in melancholy.  The slight<BR>hindrance, sometimes, is Sidney's versification itself.<BR>The reader may find it slightly stilted and a bit too<BR>poetically \\"artificial\\" to meet the rhythm or the rhyme.<BR>However, the glories far outweigh the slights.  A further<BR>help to understanding Sidney might come from applying<BR>deeper SYMBOLISM and interpretation to his works, in<BR>names and themes. There is this left to end: <BR>Love makes the earth water to drink,<BR>Love to earth makes water sink;<BR>And if dumb things [without speech] be so witty<BR>Shall a heavenly grace want pity?<BR>[from: -Astrophil and Stella-.]<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-03-10

Chaucer has offended the God of<br />Love by his translation of -The Romance of the<BR>Rose-, and his writing of the poem of -Troilus<BR>and Criseyde- in which he portrayed love and<BR>women in a poor light.  In compensation, Chaucer<BR>awakens from his dream concerning this meeting<BR>with the God of Love and Alcestis and begins his<BR>&quot;Legend of Good Women&quot;, which is subdivided into the<BR>sections titled: &quot;The Legend of Cleopatra, Queen<BR>of Egypt, Martyr&quot;; &quot;The Legend of Babylonian Thisbe,<BR>Martyr&quot;; &quot;The Legend of Dido, Queen of Carthage, <BR>Martyr&quot;; &quot;The Legends of Hypsipyle and Medea,<BR>Martyrs&quot;; &quot;The Legend of Roman Lucrece, Martyr&quot;;<BR>&quot;The Legend of Ariadne of Athens&quot;; &quot;The Legend of<BR>Philomela&quot;; &quot;The Legend of Phyllis&quot;; &quot;The Legend of<BR>Hypermnestra.&quot;  There are excellent Notes from page<BR>233 253, a Select Bibliography, and an Index of<BR>Proper Names.<BR>These works are very accessible and highly enjoyable<BR>and insightful.

In the Preface to the 1st edition, published<BR>in 1971, Dahlberg says: &quot;This translation of the -Romance<BR>of the Rose-, the first in modern English prose, is one of <BR>nearly a dozen volumes during the past decade to present<BR>an edition, a translation, or a major commentary on the<BR>Old French poem. The aim of this book is to provide a<BR>clear, readable text that is as faithful as possible to<BR>the original, particularly in terms of imagery.  Because<BR>translations have their pitfalls and because thirteenth-<BR>century assumptions about the use of imagery, indeed of<BR>poetry, are very different from ours, I have provided a<BR>variety of materials that may help the reader to approach <BR>the poem with an approximation of the perspective of that <BR>time.  The Introduction, Notes, and Illustrations are <BR>designed primarily to elaborate and clarify such a view<BR>of the poem.&quot;<BR>In the 2nd Preface, to the 1983 edition, Dahlberg says:<BR>[after saying that minor errors have been corrected<BR>and additions have been made to the Bibliography]<BR>&quot;During recent years, a number of writers have reemphasized<BR>the contrast between the two authors in their treatment<BR>of the poem's allegory.

This review relates to the volume 1 of Dante Alighieri's<br />-The Divine Comedy-, Hell; Translated by Dorothy L. Sayers,<br />Penguin Classics, 1949.  346 pp.<br />Other reviewers have spoken to the perceived weaknesses<br />and problems with this particular translation and<br />volume, with Ms. Sayers' &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Notes.&quot;<br />Perhaps one should be warned before entering its portals,<br />as constructed by Ms. Sayers, that this is not an &quot;easy&quot;<br />Hell to assimilate.<br />Yet, at the beginning of her &quot;Introduction,&quot; she presents<br />the offering in an inviting fashion: &quot;The ideal way of<br />reading -The Divine Comedy- would be to start at the first<br />line and go straight through to the end, surrendering to<br />the vigour of the story-telling and the swift movement<br />of the verse, and not bothering about any historical<br />allusions or theological explanatios which do not occur<br />in the text itself. That is how Dante himself tackles<br />his subject.&quot;<br />Some readers may not find Ms. Sayers' translation to be<br />one that lends itself to &quot;swift movement of the verse.&quot;<br />The value here, however, is the wealth of information<br />provided in both the &quot;Introduction&quot;, the Notes, and<br />in the map drawings which clearly help the mind's eye<br />understand the &quot;lay-out&quot; of Hell as depicted by Dante.<br />The value of Ms. Sayer's &quot;Introduction&quot; is its clear<br />presentation of HER view of Dante, his work, his value,<br />his meaning, and his emphases.<br />She concentrates on the Images of Hell and on the Christian<br />doctrine implicit in the work.  This translation is in<br />keeping with that emphasis, for it is structured,<br />somewhat restricted, and presents &quot;Dante's&quot; voice<br />as more attuned to the didactic and lecturing.  Even the<br />voices of the denizens of Hell have the tones of<br />stern lesson-learning rather than evoking pity for<br />their failed virtue and blind human proclivities.<br />The problem with some readers, and some viewers of<br />Christianity, is trying to reconcile the idea of<br />stern, unrelenting, eternal Judgment and damnation<br />for sins with the idea of God's eternal Love, or as<br />Ms. Sayers translates the second tercet of Dante's<br />*terza rima* on the lintel of the entrance to Hell:<br />Justice Moved My Great Maker; God Eternal<br />Wrought Me: The Power, And The Unsearchably<br />High Wisdom, And The Primal Love Supernal.<br />Ms. Sayers will have no human shilly-shallying with<br />Dante's intent or the purpose of Hell.  And that,<br />though it may appall some readers, is to the good;<br />for it forces the reader to confront whether or not<br />he or she accepts or does not the Christian doctrinal<br />views -- and helps the reader to understand the<br />serious nature of choosing one's faith and one's<br />religion, or not.<br />After each Canto, Ms. Sayers uses the same very<br />helpful devices for explaining the preceding Canto:<br />first, she discusses the main Images to be found in<br />that particular Canto in a very clear, full, doctrinal<br />way -- and then, she has the numbered notes which<br />explain allusions and phrases which Dante uses in<br />the work.<br />For instance, after Canto I, we find: &quot;The Images.<br />-The Dark Wood- is the image of Sin or Error -- not so<br />much of any specific act of sin or intellectual perversion<br />as of that spiritual condition called &quot;hardness of heart&quot;,<br />in which sinfulness has so taken possession of the soul as<br />to render it incapable of turning to God, or even knowing<br />which way to turn.&quot;  Similarly, after Canto III, we find<br />this note concerning the phrase &quot;the good of intellect&quot;:<br />&quot;In the -Convivio- Dante quotes Aristotle as saying:<br />'truth is the good of the intellect'.  What the lost souls<br />have lost is not the intellect itself, which still functions<br />mechanically, but the -good- of the intellect: i.e., the<br />knowledge of God, who is Truth.&quot;<br />This is an excellent edition for the scope of Ms. Sayers'<br />medieval scholarship and doctrinal insights.

This review relates to the volume -Dante: Inferno-; Translated,<BR>Edited, and with an Introduction by Anthony Esolen.  The Modern<BR>Library.  2002/2003 paperback.  491 pp. [Dual language version,<BR>Italian on left pages, English translation on right pages.]<BR>What makes one English translation of Dante's -Inferno-<BR>better than another?  That is a question that each reader,<BR>with his or her own educational background, tastes, <BR>understandings, and desires to account for must answer.<BR>I, personally, knew that I would like this version very<BR>much when I picked it up, read the Modern Library's biographical<BR>piece about Dante, and then began to read Anthony Esolen's<BR>&quot;Introduction.&quot;  The Modern Library has given any reader<BR>the solid, but brief, background to proceed on this<BR>quest or pilgrimage with Virgil and Dante through the<BR>Inferno, or Hell.  The biographical piece immediately<BR>tells the reader that &quot;Dante Alighieri, the Italian poet,<BR>whose great allegory -The Divine Comedy- has exerted<BR>profound effect on Western literature and thought, was born<BR>in Florence in May 1265.  He came from a noble though<BR>impoverished family, descendants of the city's Roman<BR>founders. *** Dante probably received his early schooling<BR>from the Franciscans and the Dominicans; later, he studied<BR>rhetoric with the Guelph statesman and scholar Brunetto Latini.<BR>Another significant mentor was the aristocratic poet Guido <BR>Cavalcanti, who strongly influenced his early work.&quot; The<BR>piece goes on to say that for the young Dante, writing<BR>poetry became an important expression of his passion for<BR>art and learning, and of his abiding concern with the nature<BR>of love and spiritual fulfillment. That is surely a very<BR>succinct and marvelous beginning, though there is much<BR>more in the biographical piece.<BR>But it is the &quot;Introduction&quot; by Anthony Esolen, which<BR>entrances in this version, along with his translation<BR>itself which is clear, compelling, easily understood,<BR>and marvellously absorbing.<BR>One knows the nature of the translation and the translator's<BR>quality when he begins an &quot;Introduction&quot; to the -Inferno-<BR>(the first section of -The Divine Comedy-) in this fashion:<BR>&quot;In Plato's -Phaedrus-, Socrates explains that true love<BR>is a passion to behold not just a beautiful face or body,<BR>but the eternal Form of Beauty itself.  To make his point<BR>he compares the soul to a charioteer and a team of horses,<BR>one obedient and the other unruly.  While the unruly horse,<br />representing appetite, strains to leap upon the beloved as<BR>soon as he is in sight, the obedient horse, the 'spirit'<BR>or 'ambition,' heeds the reins and the whip of the shuddering<BR>driver, who recalls that eternal Beauty and beholds its<BR>image with awe and reverence.  Dante never read the -Phaedrus-,<BR>but in a deep sense he is at one with Plato, for he too<BR>believes that the goal of human life is to behold Beauty,<BR>and he too believes that the way to that beholding is<BR>traversed by love.&quot; Truly that is a wondrous way to<BR>begin the journey, even to Hell -- or, perhaps, especially<BR>to -- and through -- Hell ... toward, ultimately, Paradise.<BR>This translation is excellent.

This review relates to the volume -The Song of Roland-,<BR>Translated and with an Introduction by Dorothy L. Sayers,<BR>Penguin Classics, 1957 (first translation, 1937). 206 pp.<BR>There seems little point in giving a work of world literature<BR>a rating of stars as to whether it is better or lesser than<BR>some other work of world literature, even of the same genre.<BR>The rating for this review is based on this particular<BR>edition and translation.<BR>The excellent qualities of this Penguin edition include<br />the \\"Introduction.\\"  Sayers discusses this \\"earliest,<BR>the most famous, and the greatest of those Old French<BR>epics which are called Songs of Deeds.\\" Her \\"Introduction\\"<BR>is divided into the highly enlightening subsections titled:<BR>The Poem; The Feudal Picture; Vassalage; Tokens; Chivalry;<BR>The Rules of Battle; Nurture and Companionage; Horses and<BR>Swords; and The Verse and the Translation. She says the<BR>poem as we have it \\"would appear to have achieved its<BR>final shape towards the end of the eleventh century.\\" But<BR>the events described in the epic took place in 778, and<BR>\\"the anonymous poet describes in detail the betrayal and <BR>slaughter by Saracens of the rearguard of Charlemagne's<BR>army under Roland -- at Rencevaux -- and Charlemagne's<BR>bitter revenge.\\"<BR>Perhaps most interesting in the \\"Introduction\\" are Ms.<BR>Sayers' character studies.  She sees that in Charlemagne,<BR>\\"beneath this larger-than-life-size figure, we discern<BR>another: the portrait of the ideal earthly sovereign --<BR>just, prudent, magnanimous, and devout.\\"  She goes<BR>further and posits that in the way he is described<BR>in this epic he even seems like an early medieval version<BR>of a \\"constitutional\\" monarch. \\"Beneath all this again<BR>is the personal character of Charlemagne -- his stately<BR>bearing, his courtesy, his valour and strength, his deep<BR>religious feeling, his friendship for Naimon, his warm<BR>affection for his nephew and the Peers....He rides<BR>and fights among his barons as the greatest baron of<BR>them all.\\"<BR>Roland, on the other hand, in Ms. Sayers' view, has a<BR>character which is \\"simplicity itself.\\"  \\"Rash, arrogant,<BR>generous, outspoken to a fault, loyal, affectionate,<BR>and single-minded, he has all the qualities that endear<BR>a captain to his men and a romantic hero to his audience.<BR>He has no subtlety at all; other men's minds are a closed<BR>book to him.\\"  This particular view of Roland makes him<BR>sound a little like a faithful pooch rather than a<BR>chivalrous knight; and perhaps strains a bit of invective<BR>at Romantics in believing that they prefer no subtlety<BR>in their heroes.<BR>The final aspect which Ms. Sayers stresses is the \\"essential<BR>Christianity of the poem.\\"  \\"It is not merely Christian in <BR>subject; it is Christian to its very bones.\\"  *** \\"And it<BR>is a Christianity as naive and uncomplicated as might be<BR>found at any time in the simplest village church.\\" However,<BR>it is a Christianity which has already made the concession<BR>to the idea of \\"just wars\\" -- and killing for \\"the right<BR>reasons.\\"  Augustine and Constantine take precedence over<BR>Jesus.<BR>This is a very readable translation and Ms. Sayers, who<BR>received a degree in medieval literature from the<BR>Somerville College, University of Oxford, in 1915, does<BR>it great credit with a readable, engrossing translation.<BR>Here is the section on the death of Roland himself (actually<BR>it takes him 3 full stanzas to die; 174, 175, and 176,<BR>even though it seems he has fully expired in the first --):<BR>Now Roland feels death press upon him hard;<BR>It is creeping down from his head to his heart.<BR>Under a pine-tree he hastens him apart,<BR>There stretches him face down on the green grass,<BR>And lays beneath him his sword and Oliphant [his horn].<BR>He's turned his head to where the Paynims are,<BR>And this he doth for the French and for Charles,<BR>Since fain is he that they should say, brave heart,<BR>That he has died a conqueror at the last. <BR>He beats his breast full many a time and fast,<BR>Gives, with his glove, his sins into God's charge.<BR>[174]<BR>------------------<BR>   -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-20

This review relates to -Catullus: The Complete Poems-,<BR>Translated and Edited by Guy Lee, Oxford World's Classics,<BR>ISBN: 0192835874.<BR> In the poet Catullus, we have a very interesting figure.<BR>On the one hand he has a mentality which is satiric,<BR>sharp-tongued in its sting (waspish, if not scorpion)<BR>which is quick to feel a slight and retaliate in<BR>even gutter-talk hyperbole -- yet, also, there is a<BR>very intelligent, sensitive, driven soul which is<BR>all too sensitive to its desires, its frustrations,<BR>and the manipulations of others.<BR>Catullus was fascinated and mesmerized and played with<BR>by a woman whom he calls \\"Lesbia\\" (who may or may not<BR>have been a notorious Clodia Pulcher, wife of Metellus<BR>Celer -- \\"notorious for her sexual license, who was<BR>even rumored to have murdered her husband Metellus by<BR>poison\\" -- Lee, \\"Introduction.\\")  But Catullus is also<BR>drawn to and played with by a young male whom he calls<BR>\\"Juventius\\" (Poems XXIV, XLVIII, LXXXI, and XCIX,<BR>and the series dealing with male love, XV-XXVI).<BR>According to Guy Lee in his \\"Introduction\\": \\"Indeed it<BR>would be true to say that we know more about Catullus<BR>from his poetry than about any other classical poet,<BR>with the exception of Horace and Ovid. This is because<BR>two thirds of his work are concerned with actual moments,<BR>incidents, and personalities in his life.  Virtually all<BR>his epigrams (I-LX as well as LXIX - CXVI) are concerned<BR>with his emotional reactions to other people, his<BR>contemporaries.\\"<BR>According to Lee, also, \\"Catullus came from a rich and<BR>influential family in the neighbourhood of Verona.  He<BR>had the entree to high society in Rome and like the<BR>satirist Lucilius in the previous century could afford <BR>to throw his weight about.\\"  However, Catullus is <BR>also highly intelligent and literate: \\"...Catullus is<BR>well known as a *doctus poeta* or scholar-poet (Martial<BR>calls hiim *doctus* on several occasions) andwas well<BR>acquainted with Greek literature, as is shown by his<BR>translations from Sappho and Callimachus, his knowledge<BR>of Greek epigram, and his not unlikely connection with<BR>the Hellenistic poet Pathenius....\\"<BR>The sensitive side of Catullus can be found in the<BR>poems bemoaning the loss of his brother in a foreign<BR>land -- and the description of the betrayal and<BR>abandonment of Ariadne by Theseus (Poem LXIV).<BR>The best poem summing up Catullus might be LXXXV:<BR>I hate and love.  Perhaps you're asking<BR>why I do that?<BR>I don't know, but I feel it<BR>happening, and am racked.<BR> -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-17

P. Postgate), and<BR>of the -Pervigilium Veneris- (by J. M Mackail)<BR>have now been updated for the better by G. P.<BR>Goold (his first 2nd edition appeared in 1988 --<BR>this reprint is dated 2000), and Goold's<BR>Introductory explanations for the state of the<BR>translations and the need for updates appear<BR>before each section of works (entire volume,<BR>Reviser's Note, Aug. 1987; Catullus, Reviser's<BR>Preface 1987; Tibullus, Reviser's Preface, 1988;<BR>-Pervigilium Veneris-, Reviser's Preface, 1984).<BR>Catullus, perhaps the best known of the 3 sources<BR>of work in this volume, is an extremely interesting,<BR>if not fascinating person and/or character.  He can<BR>be rough and bawdy and cynical, and at other times<BR>stricken, driven, haunted, and sympathetic.  His<BR>poems are satiric attacks using \\"gutter language\\"<BR>and sexual accusations, name-calling (especially<BR>relating to ... proclivities) --<BR>but they are also songs of pain, frustration, despair,<BR>self-criticism, and complaint.  There are also<BR>exceptionally moving poems that recite the feelings<BR>of the family and of himself over the loss of his<BR>brother. Many editions of Catullus use euphemistic<BR>language to get around his direct rough talk, or<BR>they simply excise the \\"offending\\" passages.  Thankfully,<BR>this new edition restores the complete text with <BR>appropriate graphic translations which give one the<BR>sense of just what kind of an artist and person<BR>Catullus was. G.P. Goold says that he has used<BR>W.H.D. Rouse's paraphrases of several of Catullus'<BR>poems because the paraphrases are so good.  Those<BR>poems paraphrased by Rouse are: 15, 21, 37, 69, 71,<BR>74, 78, 79,80, 89, 94, 97, 100, 110, 112, and 113.<br />Here for those who can take it are the opening<BR>lines of 37 (paraphrased by Rouse): ...BR>Tibullus, on the other hand, is a bit quieter -- his<BR>opening lines talk of pastoral peace (until he a little<BR>later starts talking to Delia and shows how driven he<BR>is, how under her spell -- and Love, oh Love -- that<BR>mesmerizer, that seducer, that desired ideal). \\"I am<BR>a captive fast bound in the bonds of a lovely girl;<BR>I sit a janitor before her stubborn doors.  I care not<BR>for glory, Delia dear; let me only be with thee, and<BR>I will pray folk call me sluggard and idler.\\" \\"But <BR>me, for I have been ever pliable to gentle Love, shall<BR>Venus' self escort to the Elysian fields.\\" <BR>-Pervigilium Veneris- \\"a poem of not quite a hundred<BR>lines celebrating a spring festival in honour of the<BR>goddess of love, is remarkable both for its beauty<BR>and as the first clear note of romanticism which<BR>transformed classical into medieval literature.\\"<BR>The poem is divided into 3 sections with sub parts:<BR>Spring -- stanza I, The arrival of spring; stanza<BR>II, The birth of Venus; stanza III, The budding of the<BR>rose.  The Festival -- stanza IV, Venus' message to<BR>the nymphs; stanza V, The nymphs' message to Diana;<BR>stanza VI, The festival at Hybla.  Litanies to Venus --<BR>stanza VII, As cosmic goddess of procreation; stanza <BR>VIII, As tutelary goddess of Rome; stanza IX, As goddess<BR>of vegetation; stanza X, As goddess of animals and birds;<BR>and a personal epilogue at the end of the poem: \\"She sings,<BR>I am mute.

This review relates to the volume -The Complete Poems<BR>of Cavafy-, Expanded Edition, Translated by Rae Dalven,<BR>published by Harcourt, Inc., 1976.<BR>Although his name is spelled as Konstantinos Petrou<BR>Kabaphes, the name by which he is usually referred is<BR>an English version, C.P. Cavafy. He lived from<BR>1863 - 1933, and resided most of his life in Alexandria,<BR>Egypt.  Perhaps the only poem that most modern readers<BR>might come in contact with in modern poetry anthologies<BR>is \\"Ithaca.\\"  And even in this poem, one can see the<BR>interesting, wry, ironic way that Cavafy has of reversing<BR>what one might think would be the usual, or \\"safe\\"<BR>way of seeing things.  Cavafy has that very interesting<BR>double vision, which knows the \\"usual\\" and the \\"accepted,\\"<BR>and yet dares to sail in the face of convention and<BR>expectation and create the unexpected, the delightful,<BR>the heart touching, the soulful.  That is not to say<BR>that he is maudlin or sentimental in a syrupy fashion.<BR>That double vision comes from the double nature of the<BR>experiencer and the viewer and the analyzer.  Cavafy<BR>was a lover of males.  The words \\"homosexual\\" and \\"gay\\"<BR>just don't even come close to doing justice or exactness<BR>to what that life direction meant to him.  For, though<BR>he knows what he is and what he desires, he also knows<BR>the surrounding culture's and religion's negative<BR>attitudes and doctrines towards that direction.  So<BR>it results in a double-awareness, with multiple levels<br />of subtle nuance. He sees, knows, analyzes the outward<BR>manifestations, experiences, modes -- and yet at the<BR>same time internally is aware, secretly, of the inner<BR>manifestations, desires, manifestations, and modes.<BR>The critical edge of judgment and decision is when<BR>and in what ways he will actualize the secret internal<BR>desire into the \\"public\\" external world.  These poems<BR>reflect those attempts and results.  However, Cavafy<BR>is also interested in ancient history, and many of<BR>his poems reflect a sort of world-weary love and<BR>appreciation, yet sadness at the passing of the past,<BR>towards the history of ancient Greece and that of<BR>the Hellenistic World which followed in the wake<BR>of the conquests and death of Alexander the Great.<BR>Here is a sample of Cavafy, the poem titled \\"At the<BR>Cafe Entrance\\":<BR>Something they said beside me directed<BR>my attention toward the cafe entrance.<BR>And I saw the beautiful body that looked<BR>as if Eros had made it from his consumate experience --<BR>joyfully modeling its symmetrical limbs;<BR>heightening sculpturally its stature;<BR>modeling the face with emotion<BR>and imparting by the touch of his hands<BR>a feeling on the brow, on the eyes, on the lips.<BR>--------------------<BR>   -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-15

Following ample precedent, it includes<BR>not only monody and choral lyric but also short poems<BR>and fragments in the elegiac and iambic meters, even<BR>though the latter do not fit the etymological definition<BR>of lyric as -- 'poetry composed to be sung to the lyre.'\\"<BR> The poets included in this volume are: Archilochus,<BR>Tyrtaeus, Callinus, Semonides, Mimnermus, Alcman, Alcaeus,<BR>Sappho, Solon, Stesichorus, Theognis, Ibycus, Anacreon,<BR>Hipponax, Xenophanes, Simonides, Corinna, Pindar, and<BR>Bacchylides.  Since the poems still remaining by Pindar<BR>and Bacchylides are more numerous than those of many of<BR>the other poets, Miller says that his selection for<BR>each of the two latter poets has been made with an<BR>attempt to choose examples which best show \\"variety<BR>of scale and treatment.\\" For Pindar, the selection is:<BR>Olympian 1, 2, 12, 13, and 14; Pythian 1, 3, 8, and<BR>10; Nemean 5, 10; Isthmian 5, 6, and 7; Paean 4,<BR>Dithyramb 2, Partheneion 2, Enkomions for Theoxenos,<BR>Thrasyboulos, and Xenophon, and Threnos 7. For<BR>Bacchylides, the selection is: Odes 2, 3, 5, 6, 11,<BR>13; Dithyrambs 17, 18; and an Enkomion for Alexandros.<BR>As example of Miller's translations, here is an<BR>excerpt from Bacchylides' Dithyramb 18: \\"Theseus\\":<BR>He is a boy,<BR>  on manhood's very verge;<BR>the sports of Ares<BR>  are what his mind is fixed on, war<BR>and battle with brazen din;<BR>  and what he seeks is splendor-loving<BR>Athens.<BR>   -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-13

Each of them has its own excellencies.<BR>There is the -John Keats: Complete Poems-, edited by<BR>Jack Stillinger (Belknap Press, Harvard) ISBN: 0674154312,<BR>-John Keats: The Complete Poems-, edited by John Barnard<BR>(Penguin Classics) ISBN: 0140422102, and also this<BR>present volume, edited by Elizabeth Cook, ISBN: 0192840630.<BR>A fact which both John Barnard and Elizabeth Cook point out<BR>as editors is their debt, as well as the debt of all Keats<BR>scholars, to Jack Stillinger.  As she says in her \\"Note on<BR>the Text\\": \\"In deciding which source text to use I am deeply<BR>indebted to Jack Stillinger who in -The Text of Keats's <BR>Poems- (1974) and in his subsequent edition of Keats's<BR>-Poems- (1978) presents his informed and considered arguments<BR>for and against each transcript and state of text.  Prior<BR>to his work editors had frequently created Keats's poems<BR>from a patchwork of different source texts.\\"<BR>  The glories of this Oxford Classics edition are the<BR>same as with many of their editions, the fine \\"Introduction\\",<BR>the wondrous notes to the poems (pp. 557 - 641), an excellent<BR>selection of \\"Further Readings\\", Glossary of Classical <BR>Names, Index of Keats's Correspondents (with much helpful<BR>background information about them), and an Index of Poem<BR>Titles and First Lines.  In this volume, there are also<BR>Appendix I, \\"St. Agnes' Eve\\" as found in George Keats's<BR>manuscript, and Appendix II, \\"La Belle Dame sans Mercy\\",<BR>as printed in the -Indicator-, 10 May 1820.  Some editors<BR>and Keats lovers feel the changes that Keats made to<BR>the latter poem to publish in the -Indicator- mar the<BR>wondrous tone and atmosphere, so they print the first<BR>version.<BR>In her \\"Introduction,\\" Elizabeth Cook stresses several<BR>important aspects of Keats's psyche and his reverences<BR>toward other authors (Spenser and Milton, in particular).<BR>From the side of the aspect of his psyche, she states:<BR>\\"Keats conceived of history as a process of *actualizing*<BR>the world's sum total of what is knowable and thinkable.<BR>In Stoic fashion he postulates a finite quantity of<BR>world-stuff of which Milton has used up an unfairly<BR>large portion, therby depleting not only his contemporaries,<BR>but posterity [later writers] as well.<BR>* * * He writes with the assumption that a certain quota<BR>of qualities, capacities, and experiences is allotted to<BR>each individual.\\"  In relating of Keats's sensitivity,<BR>sense of dedication, and love, she says: \\"In June 1818,<BR>when one brother, Tom, was dying of tuberculosis and<BR>the other, George, planning to sail with his new bride<BR>for America, Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, 'My Love<BR>for my Brothers from the early loss of our parents and <BR>even for earlier Misfortunes has grown into a affection<BR>\\"passing the Love of Women\\".\\"  This was a section of<BR>verse from the Old Testament regarding the love of<BR>Jonathan, King Saul's son, and David, the exiled,<BR>hunted song singer, which Herman Melville was also<BR>attracted to.<BR>  The formatting in this edition is very readable,<BR>the font is medium, not small, the layout of the<BR>pages is uncrowded and accessible, so that even with<BR>the longer poems one is not presented with a complicated<BR>task by smaller type.<BR>The excellence of this Oxford edition is the inclusion<BR>of 87 (!) of Keats's letters to various correspondents<BR>(pp. 348 - 543), as well as the prose pieces, \\"When <BR>Alexandre the Conquerore was wayfayring\\" (which according<BR>to the Notes was \\"Composed probably late 1815 while Keats<BR>was a student at Guy's [Hospital].  The only source for<BR>this fragment is Walter Cooper Dendy, -The Philosophy of<BR>Mystery- (London, 1841), pp. 99-100 where it is quoted at<BR>theend of a chapter on the pathology of 'Poetic Phantasy<BR>or Frenzy.\\"  The other prose pieces are \\"Keat's Marginalia<BR>to the Shakespeare Folio\\", \\"Keats's Marginalia to Milton's<BR>-Paradise Lost-\\", a piece on \\"Mr. Kean\\" [the actor], and<BR>the \\"Rejected Preface to -Endymion-.\\" Keats's letters are<BR>a very valuable source of information of his views on<BR>poetry as a craft and an avocation, as well as providing<BR>commentary on his times.<BR>  The only caution with these large-size Oxford Major<BR>Works is that one should be very careful not to crease<BR>the outside binding, as the pages if not sufficiently<BR>glued, might tend to come apart. Otherwise the Oxford<BR>Classics editons, and this one in particular, are<BR>treasured resources of fine works as well as extremely<BR>helpful scholarship.<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-10

[John Milton, son of a scrivener and musician...]<BR> This review is of the Oxford World's Classics edition of<BR>-John Milton: The Major Works- (ISBN: 019280409X),<BR>edited and with an Introduction by Stephen Orgel and<BR>Jonathan Goldberg.<BR> \\"That kings for such a tomb would wish to die\\" (John<BR>Milton-- \\"On Shakespeare\\") -- \\"one of the greatest,<BR>most noble, and most sublime poems which either this<BR>age or nation has produced\\" (John Dryden -- on -Paradise<BR>Lost-). The picture drawn of Milton, his life, and his<BR>career (or careers) by Orgel and Goldberg is of a<BR>man of intelligence and means who had been educated<BR>for the life of a gentleman and a scholar in his<BR>early life, yet finding that the surge of events<BR>and ideologies has a way of changing one's timing,<BR>course of expression, and even personal fate.   Thus<BR>Milton makes conflicting statements about his intents,<BR>his \\"ripeness\\" (maturity of intellect and wisdom, more<BR>than age), and which venue is his real chosen arena<BR>of expression.<BR>  His first published poem, is anonymous, and is<BR>\\"On Shakespeare\\" included in \\"the dedicatory verses<BR>to the second Shakespeare folio[1632].\\" (Chronology.) Yet<BR>in his first signed publication, -The Reason for Church<BR>Government- (1642), a prose tract, \\"Milton presents himself ...<BR>as a poet who uses only his 'left hand'<BR>in writing prose. In the account he gives, his entire<BR>life appears to have been spent in training as a poet.\\" (Introduction.)<BR> As the eldest son, however, he \\"had been from childhood<BR>'destined'...to a Church career.\\" (Introduction.)  But<BR>events intrude, as well as yearnings, and the 2 Jan. 1646<BR>publication of -Poems of Mr. John MIlton, Both English<BR>and Latin-, dated 1645. The Church career never materializes,<BR>but in a strange way, a more interesting \\"preaching\\" or<BR>\\"exhorting\\" or \\"inspirational\\" one does, through his<BR>poetry, rather than his political tracts. And Milton,<BR>perhaps even oblivious to his own constantly self-<BR>revisionist attitudes and stances, creates a more<BR>enduring legacy which has influenced literature,<BR>scholarship, views about justifying \\"the ways of<BR>God to man\\" (from -Paradise Lost-), and the common<BR>cultural views about Satan, and Hell, and the Fall,<BR>even more so than those of Dante.<BR>  This is an excellent edition which contains the<BR>shorter English poems, the Latin poems (with both<BR>Latin text on left pages -- and the Enlish translations<BR>on the right pages), Selections from -A Book of<BR>Sylvae-, Greek poem added 1673, Carmina Elegiaca,<BR>the Prose Works: from -The Reason of Church Government-,<BR>from -An Apology for Smectymnuus-, -The Doctrine and<BR>Discipline of Divorce (Complete), -Of Education-<BR>(Complete), -Areopagitica- (Complete), -The Tenure<BR>of Kings and Magistrates- (Complete), from -The<BR>Second Defence of the English People, -The Ready and<BR>Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth- (Complete).<BR>  Of course, there is also -Paradise Lost- (Complete);<BR>-Paradise Regained- (Complete); and -Samson Agonistes-<BR>(Complete).  Highly enlightening are 3 Familiar Letters<BR>of 1674: \\"To Charles Diodati, 1637\\"; \\"To Benedetto<BR>Buonmattei, 1638\\"; and \\"To Leonard Philaras, Athenian.\\"<BR>There is a lengthy excerpt from -Christian Doctrine-<BR>which starts out talking of \\"restoring religion to <BR>something of its pure original state\\" and has the<BR>very interesting (telling) perspective on Milton's<BR>own \\"cross\\": \\"If I were to say that I had focused<BR>my studies principally upon Christian doctrine because<BR>nothing else can so effectually wipe away those two<BR>repulsive affictions,tyranny and superstition [of<BR>course, no idea that doctrine itself might promote<BR>those two evils -- R.K.], from human life and the<BR>human mind, I should show that I had been concerned <BR>not for religion but for life's well-being.\\" And<BR>the glory of Oxford editions, there are copious<BR>notes in the back going from page 735 to page 959,<BR>Further Reading List, and Index of Titles and First<BR>Lines.

John Barnard says in his \\"Introduction\\":<br />\\"Jack Stillinger's -The Poems of John Keats- (Cambridge,<br />Mass., 1978) and his -The Text of John Keats- (Cambridge,<br />Mass., 1974) now give the fullest available account of<br />Keats's text, and are based on a comparision of the<br />printed texts with the wealth of manuscript material,<br />now mainly in American libraries.\\"<br />  And this edition compiled and edited by Jack<br />Stillinger has it glories, too.  The first of these<br />is the excellent \\"Introduction,\\" which has meaningful<br />insights in it concerning Keats, but which can also<br />be related to one's own experiences in life, though<br />Stillinger does not himself so relate them. A few<br />of these I like very much are: \\"Obviously Keats had<br />an exceptionally keen sensitivity to the minute<br />particulars of objects, sounds (as well as various<br />shades of silence), and motions in the world around<br />him.\\" *** \\"He nursed his brother Tom in a lengthy<br />illness that ended in death on December 1st of this<br />year [1818], and as an added complication he met and<br />fell in love with Fanny Brawne.  More than anything<br />else, I think, it is this combined experience of<br />suffering, death, and love all at once, against a<br />background of serious conversation, reading, and<br />thinking, that accounts for Keats's sudden rise to<br />excellence in his poetry.\\"<br />  There is no way, of course, to share Keats's<br />poetry in a review of this sort.

This collection of excerpts from ancient sources concerning<BR> athletes, athletic contests, skills, prizes, and the<BR> athletic \\"mystique\\" is excellent.  For it gives a<BR>generous overview from different sources, from different<BR>ancient venues, and from different time periods. The<BR>reader gains a growing sense of the awe and reverence<BR>in which skilled as well as beautiful athletes were<BR>held, both by spectators at the events as well as<BR>through the fame which they gained that was passed<BR>down in inscriptions, statues, poetry, and the<BR>memories of those who heard of their skills and<BR>victories even in distant places.<BR>  The excerpts are not excessively long, but they are<BR>highy interesting and instructive.  The topics covered<BR>by chapters are: the Earliest Days of Greek Athletics/<BR>Nudity and Equipment/ The Events at a Competition <BR>(Running, Wrestling, Boxing, Pankration, Pentathlon, <BR>Equestrian, Music, Poetry and Prose Composition, Acting,<BR>Painting)/ Organization of a Panhellenic Festival/ Local<BR>Festivals/ Role of the Games in Society/ Women in<BR>Athletics/ Athletes and Heroes/ Ball Playing/ Gymnasion,<BR>Athletics, and Education/ Spread of Greek Athletics in<BR>the Hellenistic Period/ Greek Athletics in the Roman<BR>Period/ Amateurism and Professionalism/ Nationalism<BR>and Internationalism/ Our Ideal and the Reality.<BR>  As the author, Stephen Miller, explains in the<BR>\\"Introduction\\":  \\"A definition of -arete- would <BR>include virtue, skill, prowess, pride, excellence, <BR>valor, and nobility, but these words, whether taken<BR>individually or collectively, do not [completely]<BR>fulfill the meaning of -arete-.\\" *** \\"...the word<BR>-arete- still carries with it a notion of ephemeral<BR>excellence and of transient triumph that make its<BR>translation an exceedingly risky business.\\"<BR>  In any particular chapter, the sources cited<BR>may include: Pausanias (author of the famous Guide<BR>Book to Greece), statue inscriptions, Athenaeus<BR>(author of the multi-volume -Deipnosophists-,<BR> Scholars at Dinner), Diodorus Siculus, poetic<BR>excerpts from the -Greek Anthology-, Plutarch,<BR>the ancient poet Pindar, Plato's dialogues, Aristotle's<BR>treatises, as well as many other Greek and Roman<BR>sources.<BR> The title which I chose for this review comes from<BR>the chapter titled \\"The Events at a Competition\\"<BR>and shows both the striving for excellence,<BR>and the transience of the accomplishment (if<BR>not the fame).  The 3 excerpts concern the<BR>athlete Phayllos of Kroton, who was a pentahlete.<BR>Some of the ancient writers thought the pentathlete<BR>was the physically most perfect and beautiful<BR>of the athletic competitors. The excerpts come<BR>from \\"The Suda\\", \\"a lexicon compiled toward the end<BR>of the 10th century after Christ and based upon a<BR>variety of earlier material\\" [Miller]. As \\"The<BR>Suda\\" says: \\"Beyond the dug-up area\\": beyond<BR>measure.  A metaphor from the pentathlon [jumping<BR>pit]. It is said to come from the pentathlete Phayllos<BR>of Kroton who, when the skammata used to be 50 feet,<BR>first exceeded them with his jumps, as the epigram<BR>on his statue says: 'Five and fifty feet flew Phayllos'.\\"<BR>The transience and the agony of ancient competitions,<BR>for they were even more brutal in some physical<BR>aspects than any modern events, come in the 3rd<BR>excerpt: \\"'To jump beyond the dug-up area': with<BR>reference to doing something hyperbolically, because<BR>Phayllos jumped more than 50 feet and tore up his<BR>leg.\\"<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-01

The book<BR>is a complete survey including information about<BR>ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, but primarily focuses<BR>on Greek and Roman sports and venues.<BR>  As the author, Michael Poliakoff, says in Chapter<BR>I, &quot;General Aspects of the Ancient Combat Sports,&quot;<BR>&quot;Boxing, wrestling, and pankration, a sport that<BR>allowed a variety of unarmed fighting tactics, were<BR>the three important forms of combat sport in the <BR>ancient world. *** The element of fighting makes<BR>combat sports easy to mark off as a group; more<BR>difficult is settling on a definition of sport in<BR>general.  I define sport and athletics in this book<BR>as activity in which a person physically competes<BR>against another in a contest with established<BR>regulations and procedures, with the immediate<BR>object of succeeding in that contest under criteria<BR>for determining victory that are different from those<BR>that mark success in everyday life.&quot;<BR>  The chapters of the book are: General Aspects of<BR>the Ancient Combat Sports/ Wrestling/ Pankration/<BR>Stick Fighting/ Boxing/ The Nature and Purpose of<BR>Combat Sport/ The Participants in Greek Combat<BR>Sport/ Metaphor, Myth, and Reality/ as well as<BR>an Appendix titled &quot;Combat Sport, Funeral Cult,<BR>and Human Sacrifice.&quot;<BR>  The book is very well illustrated throughout<BR>the text with photographs from vases, drinking<BR>cups, statues, Egyptian wall paintings and<BR>sculptures, a photo of a Greek wrestling<BR>manuscript, and a modern photo of Nuba wrestlers<BR>in the Sudan.<BR>  Each of the chapters is also divided into <BR>interesting sub-sections.  In Chapter VI, for<BR>instance, the sub-sections are: The Problem of<BR>Athletic Violence/ The Nature of Ancient Criticism/<BR>Military Consideratons/ Military Critics/ An <BR>Agonistic Society/ Sport in Other Cultures: The<BR>Contrast with Greece/ and, Greek Agon and Social<BR>Need.<BR>  Each chapter starts with a highly interesting<BR>and engrossing introductory paragraph.  From the<BR>&quot;Wrestling&quot; chapter comes this: &quot;Wrestling appealed<BR>deeply to the ancients.  Though far from being a<BR>gentle sport, it is substantially less violent and<BR>injurious than the other two combat sports: it pits<BR>one man against another in a close struggle that<BR>maximizes the role of skill and science.  In a<BR>manner that encourges wide participation, it tests<BR>an array of martial virtues: cunning, boldness,<BR>courage, self-reliance, and perseverance.&quot;<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-02-01

Murray, revised by William F. Wyatt. Vol. 2<br /> (ISBN: 0674995805) contains Books 13 - 24. This<br /> is a 2nd edition of these volumes, issued in 1999.<br /> In explaining why a revision of Murray's translation<br /> was needed, Wyatt says in the &quot;Preface&quot;: &quot;A.T.<br /> Murray's translation of the -Iliad- has long set<br /> a standard for accuracy and style. But its archaic<br /> language no longer seems as appropriate as it did<br /> to earlier generations of readers.  In revising it to<br /> fit the expectations of today's readers I have changed<br /> little substantively, but have modernized diction<br /> throughout.&quot;  And Wyatt is true to his word -- the<br /> revised translation reads easily, but still gives<br /> the flavor of Homer's poetic style through repeated<br /> introductory formulas such as: &quot;Then in answer to<br /> him spoke Achilles, swift of foot&quot;  and &quot;Then the<br /> incomparable seer took heart, and spoke, saying...&quot;.<br />  Also included are the wondrous Homeric similes<br /> with the full force of their acute observations,<br /> poetic flow, and telling imagery.  Here is an<br /> example describing the spread of the Achaeans<br /> throughout the camp: &quot;Just as a consuming fire makes<br /> a boundless forest blaze on the peaks of a mountain,<br /> and from afar can the glare be seen, so from their<br /> magnificent bronze, as they marched out, went the<br/> dazzling gleam through the sky to the heavens.&quot;<br />  Included in Vol. 1 is an Introduction as well as<br /> an updated short Bibliography of critical text<br /> citations, Editions and commentaries, Recent<br /> translations, Reference, Linguistic, General<br /> works on Homer, and Studies on the Iliad.<br />  And as Achilles says after he has slain Hector,<br />&quot;There lies by the ships a dead man unwept, unburied --<br />Patroclus; him will I not forget so long as I am<br />among the living, and my knees are quick.  And even<br />if in the house of Hades men forget their dead, yet<br />will I even there remember my dear comrade.&quot;<br />  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-31

The<BR> present book begins by examining the impact of the<BR> decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics on nine-<BR> teenth century American literature, and then, ranging<BR> back and forth over literary history, practical criticism<BR> of individual works, and speculative criticism, it relates<BR> the image of hieroglyphics to the larger reciprocal<BR> questions of the origin and limits of symbolization<BR> and the symbolization of origins and ends.&quot;<BR>  This is an amazing tour-de-force for any lover of<BR> 19th century American literature, its major Titan<BR> figures, symbolism, and Egyptian influences on<BR> American psyches.<BR>   -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-25

Through her<BR> father, a famous Alexandrian mathematician, she became<BR> acquainted with the mathematical sciences and classical<BR> philosophy.  She gained wide fame through her remarkable<BR> activities as a teacher.  * * * One source told how,<BR> 'clothed in a mantle, she used to wander about the city<BR> [of Alexandria, Egypt] and expound to willing listeners<BR> the works of Plato, Aristotle, or some other philosopher.'&quot;<BR>   One of my favorite people discussed at length in the<BR> work is Michael Acominatus, the very Idealistic lover<BR> of Hellenic culture, who was appointed Archbishop to<BR> Athens and served for a period of 30 years.<BR>   -- Robert Kilgore	2004-01-25

This Riverside Edition of the -Poetry and Prose of<BR> Alexander Pope- published by Houghton Mifflin is an<BR> excellent collection.  For it contains complete works<BR> from his earliest efforts (Pastorals written at the age<BR> of 16) through the final Four Book complete version<BR> of \\"The Dunciad\\" which he published in October 1743.<BR>  Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 -- 30 May 1744) is the<BR> middle representative of a great Triumvirate of <BR> British literature encompassing the Neo-Classical<BR> or Augustan Age.  This period saw, at its best, writers<BR> emulating the classical values and styles which they<BR> found in the ancient works of Greece and Rome. Also,<BR> as a result of the excellent educational backgrounds<BR> which they received, writers desired to bring forth<BR> English translations of those ancient Greek and Roman<BR> writers. Pope brought out an excellent English <BR> translation of Homer's -Iliad-.  The other two<BR> authors of the Triumvirate are John Dryden (1631 - 1700)<BR> before Pope, and Samuel Johnson (1709 - 1784) after Pope.<BR>   The works included in this well-priced volume are:<BR> Pastorals (with a Discourse on Pastoral Poetry); The<BR> Episode of Sarpedon (from The Iliad); Sapho to Phaon;<BR> An Essay on Criticism (complete); Messiah; Epistle to<BR> Miss Blount, With the Works of Voiture; Windsor-Forest;<BR> The Rape of the Lock (complete); Epistle to Mr. Jervas;<BR> Eloise to Abelard; Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate<BR> Lady; To Mr. Addison; An Essay on Man (complete); Epistles<BR> to Several Persons: Richard Temple, To a Lady, Allen<BR> Lord Bathurst, Richard Boyle; An Epistle to Dr.<BR> Arbuthnot; Satires and Epistles of Horace Imitated<BR> (First Satire, Second Book; Second Satire, Second<BR> Book; Second Satire, First Book; Second Epistle,<BR> Second Book; First Epistle, Second Book; Sixth<BR> Epistle, First Book; First Epistle, First Book);<BR> The Satires of Dr. John Donne, Versified (Second<BR> Satire; Fourth Satire); Epilogue to the Satires<BR> (Dialogue I; Dialogue II); The Dunciad, in Four<BR> Books (complete); A Letter to the Publisher;<BR> Martinus Scriblerus of the Poem; Book First,<BR> Book Second, Book Third, Book Fourth); essay<BR> in -The Guardian-, No. 40; Peri Bathous, or <BR> The Art of Sinking in Poetry; Preface to the<BR> Iliad; and Preface to the Works of Shakespear.<BR>     Pope, born a Roman Catholic and suffering a <BR> tubercular infection of the spine in adolescence<BR> which stunted his growth and gave him a hump-backed<BR> appearance, was an outsider to the mainstream of<BR> British life in one sense.  Yet it gave him a<BR> very good vantage from which to be able to critique<BR> and satirize the people and events around him.<BR> However, he is not simply the jabbering, acid-penned<BR> \\"monkey\\" that many of his targets were all too prone<BR> to counter-mock him as being.  Pope was a highly<BR> intelligent, thoughtful, reasonable (when not riled),<BR> extremely well-read genius.  And even though he bears<BR> all the regalia of the Neo-Classical scholar and poet,<br /> yet some of his views and feelings seem like the<BR> forerunners of English Romanticism -- he favored the<BR> natural, unsymmetrical English garden over the stylized,<BR> pruned, sculpted, balanced Neo-Classical gardens of the<BR> French.<BR>    No reader should be wary of the multiple lines of<BR> poetry which may be encountered in Pope.  Simply go<BR> slowly -- think about what he is saying and enjoy<BR> his intelligence, his reason, his classical learning,<BR> and even his satirical thrusts. <BR>    -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-25

The<BR> Byzantine church epigrams, for instance, might seem<BR> dull reading, but they give remarkable insight into<BR> the Byzantine religious views as well as the sense<BR> of wonder at the beauty, splendour, and awe which<BR> the colors, the ikons, and the marble veins in the<BR> churches caused in the poetic viewers.<BR>  The section on the statues in the gymnasium is<BR> rather put down by the translator W.R. Paton as<BR> being the work of a bombastic poet, but there are<BR> remarkable turns of phrase and insight within this<BR> section as well.<BR>  Those who have ever been lured, or frustrated, or<BR> angered by the amatory effusions of women will find<BR> Book V inviting: &quot;They drive me mad, those rosy<BR> prattling lips, soul-melting portals of the <BR> ambrosial mouth, and the eyes that flash under <BR> thick eyebrows, nets and traps of my heart....&quot;<BR> by Dioscorides.<BR>  Those who might be interested in male-to-male<BR> epigrams along the same erotic/psychological/<BR> thought-filled lines would do well to go to<BR> Volume 85 of the Loeb Anthology, which contains<BR> Books X-XII, Book X contains the Hortatory and<BR> Admonitory Epigrams/ Book XI has the Convivial<BR> and Satirical Epigrams/ and Book XII has Strato's<BR> &quot;Musa Puerilis,&quot; poems written about erotic love<BR> toward males. &quot;Lysanias, yes indeed thou art fair,<BR> fair.  But before I can say this clearly, an echo<BR> says, 'He is another's.&quot; -- Callimachus.<BR> (ISBN: 0674990943)<BR>   The epigram as a genre of poetry is easy and<BR> delightful to read -- and the volumes of this<BR> Anthology serve it in delightful bites which<BR> can be consumed as much or as little in a single<BR> reading as one desires.  &quot;Chacun a son gout.&quot;<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-24

This collection of poems of love, longing, sadness,<BR> rejection, and mourning for lost loves (those who have<BR> died, and those who have gone away...) is a very fine,<BR> but uneven, expression of the range of thought and<BR> emotion which can encompass relations between male<BR> and male -- on the erotic and the psychological level.<BR>   The editor, Neil Powell, has divided the poems into<BR> six groupings under the titles: Nature Boys -- Street <BR> Life -- Lads' Love -- As It Is -- Borderlines -- In<BR> Memoriam.  Within each grouping, the poets and their<BR> poems are presented in chronological order.  As the<BR> editor points out, he has included poems going back<BR> as far as eighth century B.C. and has \\"allowed 'love'<BR> to encompass as wide a range of affectionate relation-<BR> ships as possible.\\"  Each grouping is preceded by an<BR> Introductory Note, which contains very interesting<BR> insights or thoughts to ponder.  Here is something<BR> from the section titled \\"Lads' Love\\" -- \\"Love poetry --<BR> regardless of sexuality -- has always had a natural<BR> inclination to celebrate the beauty and desirability<BR> of subjects who are significantly younger than their<BR> admiring authors (also regardless of the fact that <BR> the young are ignorant, vain, selfish, unreliable...).\\"<BR> That's certainly a surprising insight to share with<BR> readers of a collection of love poetry, espcially<BR> for a group, which as a whole, puts such a<BR> premium on youth, looks, and sensuality -- usually<BR> over sense.<br />  The poets include Theocritus, Virgil, Sir Philip<BR> Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare,<BR> Walt Whitman, John Addington Symonds, Oscar Wilde,<BR> C.P. Cavafy, Wilfred Owen, Solon, Alcaeus, Catullus,<BR> Martial, Strato of Sardis, Michelangelo, Lord Byron,<BR> Homer, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson among the famous --<BR> and a convocation of the lesser known, but no less<BR> feeling and thoughtful trekkers of the quest.<BR>  To my own taste, some of the poems seem uneven<BR> in quality -- and the tone of many of them seems<BR> \\"artificial\\" -- stagey -- though some of them overcome<BR> that \\"staged-effect\\" quality to become quite humane,<BR> telling, and heart-felt.<BR>  The poems of the classical authors are often presented<BR> with the translations by famous authors themselves,<BR> such as John Dryden as translator of Virgil's pastorals,<BR> Solon translated by J.A. Symonds.  Each of the six<BR> sections may contain poems by previous poets in other<BR> sections, so the representations are fuller in <BR> giving voice to many facets of the same poets.<BR>   All in all, this is an excellent collection, especially<BR> for the novice reader or even the more experienced<BR> reader and liver of male-love-related themes.<BR>  \\"Catching up with each other halfway to where we're<BR> going / any day is a likelihood, and an unexpected<BR> extra.\\" -- Peter Daniels. from: \\"Liverpool St.\\"<BR>  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-22

This collection of Hellenistic poetry is a very fine<BR> addition to anyone's library.  The editor and translator,<BR> Barbara Hughes Fowler, has chosen representative poets<BR> and works which have been influential on later authors,<BR> as well as those which show off the wide specturm of<BR> themes, genres, and approaches of the Hellenistic poets.<BR> There are 8 Idylls from Theocritus; Hymns to Apollo,<BR> Demeter, and Artemis, as well as On the Bath of Pallas,<BR> and Epigrams from Callimachus; the entire work of<BR> -Argonautica- (The Voyage of the Argo; Jason and the<BR> Argonauts) by Apollonius of Rhodes; the Procuress, the<BR> Schoolmaster, Women at the Temple, and Friends in<BR> Private from Herodas; the Proem and Weather Signs<BR> from -Phaenomena- of Aratus; &quot;Europa&quot; from Moschus;<BR> &quot;Lament for Adonis&quot; from Moschus; &quot;Lament for Bion&quot;<BR> from Pseudo-Moschus; Selections from the -Greek<BR> Anthology- by Antipater of Sidon, Anyte, Asclepius,<BR> Dioscorides, Diotimus, Erinna, Leonidas of Tarentum,<BR> Meleager, Tymnes, Mnasalcas, Bassus, Crinagoras, <BR> Philodemus, and Rufinus; and the short work &quot;Wings&quot;<BR> from A Technopaignion.<BR>  Ms. Fowler has a unique perspective on the Hellenistic<BR> Age, for she is interested in the increased voices<BR> given to the issues of humanity during this period --<BR> &quot;Quite new in the history of Western literature are<BR> the sensitive descriptions of heterosexual love; the<BR> sense of sinning; the pathos of the death of young<BR> women before marriage or in childbirth, of children<BR> dead in infancy, of young men dead before their <BR> parents, of the very old.  New too, accordingly, is<BR> the sympathetic treatment of women, children, babies,<BR> and pets, of cities and the ordinary people who<BR> inhabit them; the delight in what is tiny -- * * * --<BR> and what is enormous - * * *-- the increased <BR> attraction of faraway peoples and places.&quot;<BR>    Ms. Fowler's approach is technically concerned<BR> with poetics as well.  She says that she has for<BR> the most part translated the dactylic hexameter, <BR> the meter of the great majority of these poems, with<BR> a six-beat basically iambic line, but to prevent<BR> that line from breaking in two, and to add variety,<BR> and often to make sound match sense she has used a<BR> heavy admixture of anapests, trochees, tribrachs,<BR> and syncopated feet.  That certainly shows a desire<BR> to do as much justice as poetically and sense-ually<BR> as it is possible for a translator to do.<BR>   For the range and variety of the selections,<BR> as well as the inclusion of the complete -Argonautica-,<BR> and the excellent quality of the translations and<BR> care for the poetics, this is an excellent anthology<BR> to own. -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-21

This one volume work in the Loeb Classical Series (# 253) is<BR>Ovid's remarkable combining of poetry, myth, astrology,<BR>astronomy, and commentary on Rome.<BR> Apparently the work was written, or completed, while<BR>Ovid was in exile in what is today Romania (in the<BR>ancient city of Tomis), having been sent there by the<BR>Emperor Augustus.<BR>  Ovid's life there must have been misery, anguish, and<BR>hardship (how different from the famous poet all<BR>Rome had talked about before his fall!).  The poems <br />about that exile, along with letters which he sent back<BR>to Rome, can be found in Loeb Classical volume, # 151,<BR> -Tristia, Ex Ponto- (ISBN: 0674991672).<BR> This present volume &quot;is a poetical treatise on the<BR>Roman calendar, which it discusses in chronological<BR>order, beginning with the first day of January and<BR>ending with the last day of June, where it stops<BR>abruptly.&quot; (Introduction.) Ovid had intended to<BR>write 12 parts to the work, but we only have the<BR>first six.  The author of the Introduction makes <BR>some scholarly speculations about what happened to<BR>the other six parts, which are very interesting.<BR>  This Loeb version is translated by James G. Frazer,<BR>who himself had orginally published a 5-volume edition<BR>of the -Fasti-, but trimmed a bit of his scholarly<BR>commentary in order to produce this one-volume edition<BR>for the Loeb series.  Frazer (1854 - 1941) was a<BR>British anthropologist, folklorist, and classical<BR>scholar; his 12 volume opus, -The Golden Bough-,<BR>is a world-famous work on comparative ancient religions,<BR>myth, and cultural rites.<BR>  Ovid, himself, was exremely interested not only<BR>in poetry, but in myth and cultural rites as well.  That<BR>is clearly evidenced in the -Fasti-. Here is an example<BR>of the combining of poetry, with myth, and astrology/<BR>astronomy from March 5: &quot;When from her saffron cheeks<BR>Tithonous' spouse shall have begun to shed the dew /<BR>at the timeof the fifth morn, the constellation,<BR>whether it be the Bear-ward or the sluggard Bootes, <BR>will have sunk and will escape thy sight. But not<BR>so will the Grape-gatherer escape thee.&quot; There is<BR>more to the quote which expands on the myth of the<BR>origin of the constellation. There are excellent<BR>notes to explain allusions, as well as a scholarly<BR>Introduction to the volume.<BR>  Though Ovid was trying to find some way to gain<BR>either commutation or release from his exile, he was<BR>not successful (either under Augustus or his successor,<BR>the Emperor Tiberius).  Still, though seeking clemency,<BR>Ovid nonetheless takes satiric swipes at Rome's<BR>losing of ancient values. Ovid died in exile and<BR>was buried in Tomis.  &quot;Sic transit gloria mundi.&quot;<BR> -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-20

The poems are sometimes fragments,<br />lines or phrases which were quoted by some ancient<br />author or by a later commentator on some ancient author,<br />who then uses the line or phrase of the poet mentioned.<br />  The \\"elegy\\" in this case is not the poem of mourning<br />that most people are familiar with.  As the Introduction,<br />by the translator and editor, Douglas E. Gerber states:<br />\\"Almost any topic, apart from the scurrilous or obscene,<br />was considered suitable for archaic elegy and in this<br />period it is therefore more apporpriate to define elegy<br />as simply a poem composed in elegiac couplets.\\"<br /> Many of the poems were composed during symposia, drinking<br />parties where intellectual discussion and cultural commentary<br />and criticism also were shared by the participants.<br />  Some of the poetry is wise advice; some is commentary<br />on love making and beauty worshipping.  All of it is<br />wondrous insight into ancient Greek thinking, ways of<br />living, and creative expression.<br />  -- Robert Kilgore.	2004-01-13

He is not an \\"art for art's<br />sake\\" temporizer or relativist.  He not only knows what<br />HE believes...but he believes he knows what YOU should<br />believe too.  If that makes you uncomfortable or makes<br />you feel hampered, you might want to pass him by until<br />you feel you can accommodate the \\"insult\\" and \\"restrictions\\"<br />on your \\"free will choices.\\"  Otherwise, there is much of<br />beauty, wonder, and insight to be gained in these pages.<br />  Ruskin's point of view is that of a classical Platonist<br />mixed with the moralizing tenor of an exhorting (but not<br />shrilly so) prophet toward beauty, Truth, and clarity of<br />vision...and moral purpose in Art. He also has a wondrous<br />prose style which is both clear, compelling, and entrancing.<br />  This edition published by Dover as a reprint is of the<br />second edition of the work from 1880.  It also includes<br />14 plates of drawings which Ruskin did to illustrate the<br />points which he makes in the text.<br />  Along the way, Ruskin includes shortened Aphorisms<br />in the margin which restate the bold face print points<br />which he is making in the text.  In Chapter 2, titled<br />\\"The Lamp of Truth,\\" Ruskin stands forth most forcefully<br />and dynamically (and perhaps to the \\"modern,\\" most<br />tendentiously) as the classical Platonic moralizer<br />and aesthetic apostle/prophet/priest.  Though raised<br />a strict Protestant, Ruskin rebelled and left Christianity<br />for a classical Paganism based on beauty, Truth, and clarity.<br />Needless to say, this more than tended to alienate him<br />and isolate him from the mercenary, industrialized<br />Victorian world which was chugging along outside his<br />hermetically sealed temple dedicated to Truth, Beauty,<br />Goodness, and Clarity.  Mercantilism and \\"practical<br />progress\\" don't exactly exalt those four princples as<br />the means or the goals whereby to make money and become<br />successful in the eyes of the world or popular opinion.<br />  But if you want to read about Truth and Beauty and<br />read it through the eyes and soul of a lover of those<br />qualities -- and read it expressed in most beautiful<br />prose and style (which is both poetic and powerful),<br />then Ruskin and this work are clearly the choices you<br />should make.<br />  This excerpt from Ruskin tied to Aphorism 29 {\\"The<br />earth is an entail, not a possession.\\") clearly shows<br />that Ruskin's vision and prophetic power extend beyond<br />the merely practical realm of architecture into an<br />all-encompassing total vision of responsibility and<br />reverence:  \\"The idea of self-denial for the sake of<br />posterity, of practising present economy for the sake of<br />debtors yet unborn, of planting forests that our<br />descendants may live under their shade, or of raising<br />cities for future nations to inhabit, never, I suppose,<br />efficiently takes place among publicly recognized motives<br />of exertion.

This opening line from Diogenes Laertius (as translated<BR>by Robert Drew Hicks) neatly sums up the approach of<BR>Diogenes in compiling this amazing amount of material<BR>about the ancient philosophers.  Some of the material<BR>is valuable, some is stuff...but even the \\"stuff\\" is<BR>pretty interesting coming from such an \\"ancient\\"<BR>compilier (one dating for Diogenes is (ca. A.D. 225-<BR>250).<BR> According to Herbert S. Long in his \\"Introduction\\"<BR>to Vol. 1 (there are 2 volumes in the complete set of<BR>the Loeb Classical Library Diogenes published by Harvard<BR>Univ. Press -- Vol. 1: ISBN 0-674-99203-2 and Vol. 2:<BR>ISBN 0-674-99204-0) -- Diogenes ranges from being a<BR>source of valuable information about the lives of the<BR>ancient philosophers to a source of highly readable,<BR>even entertaining, but sometimes unreliable thought<BR>bites.<BR>  A few things Long has to say are: \\"His account of Plato,<BR>one of his longest, clearly shows how superficial and<BR>unreliable he was [sigh...].\\"  \\"The tone of his work as<BR>a whole suits better a man of the world who happened to<BR>be interested in philosophers, but more as men and writers<BR>than as philosophers in a technical sense.\\"  Which means<BR>that Diogenes can appeal to the general reader who is<BR>interested in anecdotes and fascinating out-of-the-way<BR>puns and \\"gossip\\" about the philosophers (as compiled<BR>from tomes of secondary and tertiary sources)-- as well<BR>as to the scholar interested in seeing the effect of<BR>a compiler/synthesizer as a source of information.<BR>According to Long, again, \\"Diogenes has acquired an<BR>importance out of all proportion to his merits because<BR>the loss of many primary sources and of the earlier<BR>secondary compilations has accidentally left him the<BR>chief continuous source for the history of Greek<BR>philosophy.\\"<BR> Volume I of the 2-volume set includes Books I through<BR>V, containing a \\"Prologue\\" and going from the beginning<BR>with Thales in Book I to Aristotle at the beginning of<BR>Book V. Volume II begins with Book VI and goes through<BR>Book X, with Antisthenes at the beginning of Book VI<BR>and ending with the entire Book X devoted to Epicurus.<BR>  Diogenes starts out his work by taking to task those<BR>who claim that philosophy arose among the barbarians,<BR>who rest their claims with the Persians and their Magi,<BR>the Babylonians and Assyrians with their Chaldaeans,<BR>the Indians with their Gymnosophists, and the Celts<BR>and Gauls with their Druids.<BR> But Diogenes assertively states: \\"These authors forget<BR>that the achievements which they attribute to the<BR>barbarians belong to the Greeks, with whom not merely<BR>philosophy but the human race itself began.\\" [!!!]<BR>  One example of his interesting material concerns<BR>the ancient figure of \\"Linus\\":  \\"Linus again was (so<BR>it is said) the son of Hermes and the Muse Urania.  He<BR>composed a poem describing the creation of the world,<BR>the courses of the sun and moon, and the growth of<BR>animals and plants. * * * Linus died in Euboea, slain<BR>by the arrow of Apollo, and this is his epitaph:<BR> Here Theban Linus, whom Urania bore,/ The fair-<BR>crowned Muse, sleeps on a foreign shore.\\"<BR>  Very provocative...certainly worth deeper<BR>investigation...so, why not plunk down your dollars and<BR>have a go at Diogenes!	2003-06-27

This volume of COLLECTED POEMS by Stephane Mallarme<BR>and translated with commentary by Henry Weinfield<BR>is a joy and a treasure. For it contains Mallarme<BR>poems from various of his collections: First Poems,<BR>Satirical Parnassus, The Contemporary Parnassus,<BR>Other Poems, Album Leaves, Street Songs, Several<BR>Sonnets, Homages and Tombs, Other Poems and<BR>Sonnets, Poems in Prose, and A Throw of the Dice.<BR>  The best appreciation of Mallarme is cited by<BR>Henry Weinfield in his &quot;Introduction&quot; to this<BR>volume.  The comments were by Paul Valery (and<BR>were about Mallarme): &quot;This poet was the least<BR>-primitive- of all poets, yet it came about that<BR>by bringing words together in an unfamiliar, strangely<BR>melodious, and as it were stupefying chant -- by the<BR>musical splendor of his verse as well as by its<BR>amazing richness -- he restored the most powerful<BR>impression to be derived from primitive poetry: that<BR>of the -magical formula-.  An exquisite analysis of <BR>his art must have led him toward a doctrine, and <BR>something like a synthesis, of incantation.&quot;<BR>  This volume contains the texts of the poems in<BR>French on the right-hand side of each page -- and<BR>the translation in English on the left-hand side.<BR>  Mallarme is an extremely interesting poet, artist,<BR>and human thinker/creator, for he has a spiritual<BR>crisis in which he came away perceiving: &quot;Yes, I<BR>-know-, we are merely empty forms of matter, but<BR>we are indeed sublime in having invented God and<BR>our soul.  So sublime, my friend, that I want to<BR>gaze upon matter, fully conscious that it exists,<BR>and yet launching itself madly into Dream, despite<BR>its knowledge that Dream has no existence, extolling <BR>the Soul and all the divine impresssion of that kind <BR>which have collected within us from the beginning of<BR>time and proclaiming, in the face of the Void, which<BR>is truth, these glorious lies.&quot;  Yet, even this, is<BR>notprecisely what Mallarme finally winds up doing...<BR>for his is a &quot;quest for Beauty and for a transcendent<BR>Ideal and the tragic vision on which that quest is<BR>based.&quot;<BR>  And all of this is enveloped in the most beautiful<BR>sounds and images...charming and mystifying...for he<BR>is also hermetic in his approach, &quot;Everything that is<BR>sacred and that wishes to remain so, must envelop<BR>itself in mystery.&quot;<BR>  Here is a portion from &quot;The Afternoon of a Faun&quot; in<BR>English -- then in French:<BR> &quot;...through the motionless and weary swoon/ Of<BR>stifling heat that suffocates the morning,/ Save<BR>from my flute, no waters murmuring/ In harmony flow <BR>out into the groves;&quot; -- &quot;par l'immodible et lasse<BR>pamoison/ Suffoquant de chaleurs le matin frais sil <BR>lutte/ Ne murmure point d'eau que ne verse ma flute/<BR>Au bosquet arrose d'accords;&quot;.<BR>  &quot;...the ancient technique of verse -- for which I<BR>retain a religious veneration and to which I atribute<BR>the empire of passion and of dreams...&quot;	2003-04-22

Well...<BR>If you want a very good anthology of Hellenistic<BR>poetry, with the Greek texts available for your<BR>own translation, and excellent commentaries and<BR>notes -- then this is your volume.<BR>  There is a total of 81 pages of Greek texts of<BR>poems -- pp. 83 to 274 are detailed, highly<BR>interesting, and enlightening commentaries on<BR>the wordings, allusions, and implications in<BR>the various poems, delivered with scholarly<BR>insight, interest, verve, and never dullness.<BR>Example -- here is a commentary on a Greek<BR>word in an excerpt from Apollonius' epic<BR>poem, -Argonautica, Book 4-, concerning Talos:<BR>[astar/aulios]&quot;the homing star&quot;.  &quot;This is a<BR>good example of Ap.'s allusion to Homeric<BR>philological problems.&quot; The editor then goes<BR>on to give the quote in Greek, as well as<BR>telling how Homer uses the word poetically,<BR>and then how Apollonius changes the order of<BR>his use of the word in his own poetic foot<BR>placement. The relation to &quot;aulios&quot; is explained<BR>as meaning &quot;it brings relief to wretched plough-<BR>men, i.e., signals their return home.  Nor is<BR>this mere pedantry: the 'gloss' is particularly<BR>apt, since 'ploughing the sea' is a common<BR>metaphor for rowing. The ploughmaen can rest;<BR>but the heroes' work is only just begun.&quot;<BR>The other notes in the commentaries are just<BR>as insightful and interesting and enrich the<BR>appreciation of the pieces.<BR>  The only drawback, at this price, for the<BR>general readership is the fact that with all<BR>this richness of detail and scholarly insight,<BR>there are no translations.  This book is meant<BR>for students of Greek to use as a text for study<BR>or class work.  General readers would greatly<BR>benefit, as would non-Greek reading scholars,<BR>if only the translations had been supplied as<BR>well.<BR>  The poets covered with various poems, pieces,<BR>and excerpts are:  Callimachus, Cleanthes, Aratus,<BR>Nicander, Theocritus, Simias, Phanocles, Apollonius,<BR>Moschus, Bion, Rhianus, Lycophron, Herondas, Machon,<BR>as well as Epigrams, and Drinking Song.<BR> There are also 4 pages of maps and a very good<BR>Introduction.	2003-04-14

This volume is more touching and insightful than most<BR>works about Oscar Wilde tend to be.  It is filled with<BR>the narrative commentary of Wilde's grandson,<BR>Merlin Holland, who gives honest opinions as well<BR>as factual detail about the various stages of<BR>Oscar Wilde's life.<BR>  The treasures, however, are the multitudes of<BR>photographs, memorabilia, and paintings that are<BR>included -- as well as drawings, satirical cartoons<BR>(mostly lampooning Oscar, both at Oxford and later<BR>in life), and wonderful notations under the items.<BR>  The most interesting photographs, for me, are<BR>the ones which were done by Napoleon Sarony. They<BR>seem to touch a more thoughtful, poetic, dreamy<BR>Oscar, rather than the posing bon vivant or the<BR>deliberately provocative aesthete/decadent.<BR>The volume does well to have one of those photos<BR>on the cover, as well as having a different photo<BR>beside the title page.  The grotesque photos,<BR>that almost make one cringe, though, are of<BR>Oscar in a skirted Greek national costume <BR>(with boots!) from April 1877; Oscar in a<BR>checkered suit and bowler hat at Oxford in<BR>1878, and Oscar at age 2 in a blue velvet<BR>dress, a daguerreotype which has been color<BR>tinted.  The weirdest photos are of the<BR>\\"blond tiger/panther\\" Lord Alfred Douglas,<BR>would-be \\"friend\\" and lover of Oscar.  His<BR>eyes look vacant, haunted, cold in most of<BR>the photos , except for the one on page 147,<BR>in which he looks touchingly sensitive and<BR>lonely...the caption below the picture says<BR>it all: \\"Douglas aged 23. 'Your slim gilt<BR>soul walks between passion and poetry.  I know<BR>Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved so madly, was you<BR>in Greek days,' Wilde wrote to him around that<BR>time.\\"<BR>  Truly a remarkable album of memories.	2003-04-14

This volume (#268) in the Loeb Classical Library<BR>editions of Greek and Latin works -- contains two<BR>major philosophical works by Cicero {Marcus Tullius<BR>Cicero -- sometimes referred to as \\"Tully\\" by later<BR>writers of the 17th and 18th centuries).  The two<BR>works are: -De Natura Deorum-, and, -Academica-.<BR>  There are, in his life and in his writings, two<BR>different Ciceros, according to the implications in<BR>Cicero's writings.  There was the public man Cicero--<BR>the lawyer in the courts (whether prosecuting or<BR>defense), the Consul, the politcal activist, the<BR>manipulator and manipulated man.  Then there was<BR>the retiree from public life, the father cast into<BR>sorrow by the grief over the loss of his daughter,<BR>the man seeking consolation and engagement with<BR>philosophy.  It is the second of these two men<BR>who is the author and thinker in these two works.<BR>  Both works are cast as dialogues...discourses, <BR>or gentlemanly \\"arguments\\" about the schools of<BR>philosophy and the approaches of philosophical<BR>thought which were available in Cicero's time.<BR>They mainly concern what had happened to philo-<BR>sophical thought after the death of Plato, and<BR>the fate of his school (the Academy) and its<BR>teachings were passed down to various \\"stewards\\"<BR>of thought.  Each of the succeeding masters of<BR>the school took a different approach toward<BR>philosophical investigation and interest, depending<BR>on how they interpreted Plato's emphases.  One<BR>group decided that it was impossible to be positive<BR>about any knowledge concerning the external world;<BR>another group decided that while a certain healthy<BR>skepticism should be held concerning sense impressions<BR>and the rational deductions which could be based on<BR>them, still there was plenty of room for rational,<BR>productive insight to be developed.<BR>  Cicero begins -De Natura Deorum- with a Preface<BR>which is addressed to his friend Brutus.  In this<BR>\\"Preface,\\" Cicero says that the various philosophical<BR>groups have argued over the nature of the gods. He<BR>says that it is important to try to discover which<BR>might be the true view, since if the gods \\"have<BR>neither the power nor the will to aid us\\" [he<BR>never presents the option that there are no gods<BR>at all], then that will lead to one way of looking<BR>at the gods and will have certain repercussions on<BR>thought and social life and the life of the country,<BR>but if there is another side, and the gods do, in <BR>fact, concern themselves in men's affairs and<BR>perhaps even intervene or let their wills be<BR>known, then that should lead to a different<BR>response on the part of man.  For, as Cicero<BR>says, \\"Piety however, like the rest of the virtues,<BR>cannot exist in mere outward show and pretence;<BR>and [without] piety, reverence and religion must<BR>likewise disappear.  And when these are gone, <BR>life soon becomes a welter of disorder and confusion;<BR>and in all probability the disappearance of piety<BR>towards the gods will entail the diappearance of<br />loyalty and social union among men as well, and <BR>of justice itself, th queen of all the virtues.\\"<BR>  Those are important ideas to consider, especially<BR>in these, our own times. Cicero says that there<BR>are two main reasons why he has turned to philos-<BR>ophy: he thought to expound philosophy to his<BR>fellow-countrymen as a duty in the interests of<BR>the commonwealth since it would greatly contribute<BR>to the honour and glory of the state to have<BR>thoughts so important and so lofty enshrined in <br />Latin literature (rather than only Greek); and,<BR>secondly, he has taken to the writing of philosophy<BR>because of the dejection of spirit occasioned by<BR>the heavy and crushing blow from the death of his<BR>daughter, Tullia (45 B.C.).<BR>  In Book I of -De Natura Deorum-, the theology<BR>of the philosopher Epicurus is expounded by <BR>Velleius, who attacks the theology and cosmology<BR>of Plato and the Stoics, and refutes the theology <BR>of the other schools from Thales downward [this<BR>is from the relation by H. Rackham in his \\"Intro-<BR>duction\\" to the work].  \\"He is answered by the <BR>Academic Cotta, who demolishes the Epicurean<BR>theology, and pronounces Epicureanism to be<BR>really fatal to religion.\\"<BR>  In Book II, the Stoic theology is set out by<BR>Balbus.  Cotta again replies, in Book III, <BR>giving the Academic criticism of the Stoic<BR>theology in the same four areas covered by<BR>Balbus. In the actual \\"debate,\\" Cicero is<BR>a somewhat silent observer, but at the end<BR>he notes the impression of the debate on his<BR>own mind.<BR>  In -Academica-, there is another dialogue, or<BR>debate.  There were two different versions of<BR>this work written by Cicero; and we have parts<BR>of both, but not the complete version of either<BR>the first or second edition (and Cicero made<BR>some changes between the two versions).  So<BR>we have a work which is a part of one edition,<BR>some fragments, and a part of the other edition<BR>put together to form a \\"whole.\\"  Again, the<BR>debate is over the approaches of philosophers<BR>outside the Academy, and the various groups<BR>which inherited and put their own stamp on<BR>the Academic thought -- the Old Academy and<BR>the New Academy. This work is dedicated and<BR>has as one of its interlocutors the great Roman<BR>scholar and librarian, Marcus Terentius Varro.<BR>Varro says that he has written nothing in philosophy<BR>because he thinks that Romans will either <BR>read the Greek, rather than any Latin <BR>version or imitation, or they won't be interested<BR>in philosophy at all, and so won't read anything,<BR>Greek or Latin.  Cicero, disagrees with Varro.<BR>He says that Romans, even those who can read<BR>Greek works of philosophy, would also be interested<BR>in Latin works as well.  And he says that works of<BR>philosophy in Latin might be of value for those<BR>who would have no interest in the Greekones.<BR>  In these two excellent translations into<BR>English by H. Rackham, the English reader will<BR>also find interest, pleasure, and insight in<BR>involvement with Cicero's presentation of these<BR>arguments and refutations of the various philo-<BR>sophical approaches to ideas, values, virtues,<BR>divinities, and schools of thought.	2003-02-01

This review refers to the work, -Cicero: On the Good<BR>Life-, translated and with introductions by Michael<BR>Grant (Penguin Classics).<BR>  What is to like about this collection of sections<BR>of essays by Cicero?  I personally favor very much<BR>the excellent introductions by Michael Grant, as well<BR>as the excellent thought and expression by Cicero.<BR> Be aware that this volume contains parts of whole<BR>works. The parts themselves are complete, but if one<BR>is looking for the whole work, then one should look<BR>to the Harvard/Loeb editions of Cicero.  Michael<BR>Grant has piloted several Penguin Classics volumes<BR>of Cicero parts, so one will have to purchase several<BR>volumes in order to get the benefit of Mr. Grant's<BR>insights and translations.<BR>  But those introductions, the main \\"Introduction\\" to<BR>this volume itself, as well as the \\"introductions\\"<BR>to each of the selections are excellent.  Michael<BR>Grant not only gives you the historical and cultural<BR>context for Cicero himself, but he also in the main<BR>\\"Introduction\\" (as he does in other volumes he<BR>superintends) gives you the historical and cultural<BR>influence which follows after Cicero, the influence<BR>of his works on later generations.  In this particular<BR>volume, Mr. Grant says that he starts first with <BR>\\"indicating how important [these works] still are<BR>for us today.\\"  \\"For Cicero, through these treatises,<BR>has been the greatest of all conservers and trans-<BR>mitters of cultural values, the greatest unifying<br />force of Europe, the shaper of its civilized speech.\\"<BR>  That is tall praise indeed.  And, when he gets<BR>to the historical influence itself, Mr. Grant is<BR>no less emphatic. \\"One of the very strongest forces<BR>contributing to the ideals of the Italian Renaissance,<BR>and thus to the whole intellectual, scientific, and<BR>social development of western Europe, was Cicero's<BR>thought as interpreted by Petrarch (d. 1374).\\"<BR> So, if you have ever scratched your head, and/or<BR>your mind, and/or your soul, and wondered just<BR>what DOES constitute the good, moral, worthy,<BR>excellent life, then Cicero is an invaluable<BR>companion to help you quest in search for an<BR>answer to that most important of quandaries.	2003-01-26

One wants to like a book that one has spent some deal<BR>of money to have bought.

The first perplexing thing is that<BR>the publishers have put the map of the ancient city in<BR>such a two-page layout that the mausoleum for Alexander's<BR>body which forms such a central axis for the city and<BR>for this book, is hidden in the folds between the two<BR>pages.  This is certainly provocative, but also a bit<BR>irritation producing.<BR>  Then comes the author's recounting of Alexander's<BR>career.  The events are mixed up, in the wrong<BR>chronological sequence.  He has put the Egyptian<BR>experience of Alexander at the beginning of Alexander's<BR>invasion (as a prelude, seeking of wisdom from the Oracle<BR>at Siwah), before the invasion even starts.  One hopes<br />that this is just a slip of the Word Processing program.<BR>It seems like parts have been inserted in wrong places...<BR>so that the final draft should have been more closely<BR>scrutinized by author, copy editor, and someone in the<BR>know about Alexander's career.  The author thanks many<BR>people at the beginning of this book.  After reading<BR>the book, some of those people might not want to be<BR>thanked.<BR> A nice helpful addition might have been an Appendix<BR>or two containing such things as a chronology of the<BR>Ptolemy rulers of Egypt -- and a chronology of the<BR>significant events of the ancient city itself.<BR>  The intended target for this book seems to be the<BR>general reader who might know next to nothing about<BR>Alexander the Great, the ancient city of Alexandria,<BR>or its cultural history.  If that is so, then the<BR>book might be a &quot;worthy&quot; buy for such a person, as<BR>a beginner's introduction; but then one should move<BR>on.  And certainly one should not take this book, nor<br />recommend this book as a definitive treatment of either<BR>Alexander or Alexandria.<BR>  As an alternative, or addition (depending upon the<BR>reader's tastes and decisions) I would recommend<BR>a compact, well illustrated, well written paperback<BR>book titled -Alexandria: Jewel of Egypt- by Jean-Yves<BR>Empereur, published by Harry N.

[excellent overview from the dust jacket]<br />  MELVILLE, the first new biography of America's<BR>great storyteller in twenty-five years [pub. 1975],<BR>is a major achievement.  Intricately and sensitively, <BR>Edwin Haviland Miller depicts the delicate balance <BR>between Melville's life and his creativity and offers<BR>a new perspective on the impact of family members upon<BR>Melville's artistic experience.<BR>  MELVILLE is an \\"inside narrative.\\"  It begins dramatically<BR>in the year 1850, when at age thirty-one Melville was<BR>completing the first draft of his greatest book, -Moby-Dick-.<BR>On Auguest 5 of that year he met Nathaniel Hawthorne, an<BR>experience which was to have an emotional and artistic<BR>impact for the rest of his life.  Hawthorne was not <BR>simply the author of -The Scarlet Letter-, or the American<BR>Shakespeare as Melville was to proclaim.  Fifteen years<BR>older, Hawthorne was the kind of father or brother whom<BR>Melville the man and the orphans in his early fiction <BR>had been searching for.<BR>  Miller weaves back to Melville's earliest years to <BR>depict the family bonds -- the weak father, the dominant<BR>mother, and the favored older brother.  Herman's world<BR>collapsed suddenly in his twelfth year when his father<BR>died, bankrupt and mad.<BR>  The biography records the painful drama of Melville's<BR>search for a replacement of the father which fictionally<BR>took the mythic form of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Ishmael.<BR>The quest in life and art proved unending, continuing into<BR>the pages of -Billy Budd, Sailor-, which was written in<BR>his last years.<BR>  *  *  * [and from within the book itself]<BR> In the letter as in the novel Melville sought the safety<BR>of farce to disguise the intense emotional attachment; the<BR>tenderest and most intimate scenes in all his writings<BR>were those between Ishmael and the cannibal.  Whether<BR>Hawthorne understood or not, Melville here exposed his<BR>love-starved heart, but, typically, the jesting tone <BR>took both men off the hook.<BR>   -- Edwin Haviland Miller.	2002-11-26
