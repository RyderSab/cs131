I listen to mystery, crime or detective stories when I walk because they keep my attention and therefore keep me motivated. Mosely's stories blend just the right amount of intrigue with intelligence. This particular combination of narration and novel stuck the right balance.	2004-10-19

Especially because there were many opportunities for it to turn into something a little less predictable. A saving grace was CJ Critt's narration. )I listened to BOT). It almost made the characters interesting. This was my first Carlotta Carlyle mystery and probably my last.	2004-07-27

I laughed out loud during the opening sequence. Alex's &quot;interpretation&quot;  of his American friend's story was fun to listen to. Then, the book switched to the 1700s, the story of the American's ancestors, and it was so relentlessly boring, repetetive, filled with minutia (lists, sorrows, etc) that at times I think I may have dozed off while walking. As Alex's grandfather's story is revealed by the woman they so much want to be the woman in the picture (who was a marvelous cahracter)the story reaches its emotional zenith. In retrospect, I wish it would have been easier to read rather than listen to this novel. Then I could have skimmed the historical sections, saved much time and not missed anything. But, in reading, I would have missed the mangled translations that made the novel worthwhile. 4 for Alex. 0 for everything else. Average=2.	2003-08-10

Even at first glance, I was so concerned with it's whiny, negative tone, and it's message that hard work has no redeeming value, that all entry level minimum wage jobs should be living wage jobs, that individuals are owed a living rather than should have to earn one, that even the hardest working lower skilled workers who manage to become supervisors are criticized for having now &quot;gone over to the other side&quot;  rather than be congratulated for bettering themselves... that I had second thoughts about her enrollment at a University that would make this required reading. After reading the entire book, I hoped that perhaps reading this biased book  would serve as a lesson in how college can assist in living a better life. Or at least a discussion on compassion  and being commited to helping those who perhaps weren't able to manage the same. When I learned that the author has been invited to campus during welcome weekend I gave up hope that the book would be a point of balanced discussion. I have encouraged my HS senior to read the book and then many of these reviews so she does not begin her college years thinking this is the kind of &quot;literature&quot; she will have to endure, and that certainly not everyone feels the way the author does. One last comment, this book has been described as funny? I winced, blinked, became bored at times, but never once, laughed.	2003-07-29

The Rendell (brilliant but with emotional loose ends) /Cohen (brilliant but a control junkie)  combo slowed Philadelphia's death. But problems of this magnitude cannot be resolved in four years. What they were able to accomplish is both encouraging and inspirational, while at the same time ultimately futile. Their very human sides are presented as well which makes the book read like a novel. The only drawback is the someitmes overly lengthy passages related to population declines and other urban historical data. I have never been to Philly. Reading this book makes me want to go there, if only to see what it looks like now.	2003-04-22

Perky Lily has nine lives. She has a car accident, then surgery. Is released from the hospital, then fights off an attacker, then goes on to write cartoons, the same day. That is just the beginning of her adventures. This is just one of the  plot lines that strains credulity. It appears that the other stories about these characters may have been better, but it's hard to believe that the person who wrote this book could actaully write something that anyone would spend time reading. Hopefully, what other reviewers and more long time readers of the series say is true: that the author could not have sanctioned this book.	2003-04-07

A major book should not rely on happenstance for its pivotal moment. I found sections two and three readable as well, and fortunatley not as predictable.  The reader is left to trust that the word of a 13 year old Briony, is enough to alter the lives of so many. I also found it disappointing not to delve into Leon's and Marshall's role. Briony becoming a nurse did not seem a convincing choice for her, although the perhaps this training rooted her in reality and enabled her develop and mature enough to see what she had wrought. The reader's satisfaction is snatched away at the end, as atonement is implicated than never realized.	2003-03-28

Then as she regressed in her personality as she progressed  in her quest for spirituality, it became clear she inherited her selfishness from her father and her superficialty from her mother. She pursues men, endangered species, a theology degree, a women's center, orthodix Judaism and herbalism before &quot;finding herself&quot; and eventual happiness.  Some of these ventures are believeble, some not. She certainly got what she deserved when she demanded a rambling opinion paper be accepted as a research paper. Why Sharon couldn't accept this reasonable requirement, yet would seek out her parents' opinion on her marriage to a man she barely knows, and they, not at all, is but one example of many that left me shaking my head.	2002-07-03

Instead, Cindy, the mulatto half-sister, the protagonist of this story, does not seem to exist in her own right, only in how she relates to and resents the novels' privileged characters. It was difficult to follow the relationships (To be fair, I listened to, rather than read this book.) Cindy's diary gradually reveals the true story behind her sale and earns her mother, Mammy, the respect she deserves. She attains, then disdains, what the &quot;Other&quot; coveted. Only in the end, as she develops a relationship with the colored congressman, is the story unpredictable and Cindy developed, at least a bit, as a character in her own right.	2002-06-26

He ignores the good advice of those who have lived there and moved on, he ignores the clear signs that he should cut his losses and get out. He seems detached from everyone, even his mentor, even his lover. In the process, a different perspective of a developing African state is revealed to the reader. One senses the hopelessness conveyed by Salim's passionless actions, a habit of his Muslim family ancestry, who do not change with the times. His relationship with Metty, his servant, seems mutually condescending as is their tradition. His relationship with Ferdinand, the son of one of his most intriguing trading customers, is ultimately and unpredictably uplifitng. So there is much to learn from this novel, if not much to enjoy.	2002-06-11

Yes, it was simple and sweet, but not much more. I was expecting substance, but instead treated to a predictable outcome, albeit via an original voice. Ashmol's search for his sister's imaginary friends, to redeem his family's reputation and recapture some semblance of happiness, is succesful in an ironic way. The most enjoyable component of this book is its setting. An opal mining town in another country served as the perfect backdrop to frame this lttle tale.	2002-05-29

This book does not devote a whole section to preaching, as did Poisonwood Bible, but the urge to educate the reader was dispensed throughout. Women are smart, men need convinced. Of what? primarily that organic is good and chemicals are bad. However, this woman recalls the last organic item she purchased, orange juice, tasted like carrot juice gone rancid. So I was't buying. However, as the interwined characters' stories were gradually developed , I became increasingly enthralled as the book progressed and the linkages exposed. I hope for Kingsolver continues this one on to the next generation, of the people that is. A little less coyote and birdcalls would not be missed. Overall, a really enjoyable novel.	2002-03-25

But, some of the intertwined characters that were fleshed out were absolutely cruel and unlikeable, others so unidimensional, that I didn't really want to know more about them, and didn't care as much as I should what happened to them. Donna and Peter deserved each other. What was there to like about Mike? I, too, was reminded of Margaret Atwood's style when reading this, but she's not one of my favorites either.

She chronologically recounts the passage of her life without revealing much about herself personally or emotionally. She gushes over most people. Most seem to like her too, but aside from her generous charity work, it's hard to understand why, since we don't learn much about her as a person. She conveniently elects not to reveal the names of those she wishes to protect, while having no qualms about publishing gossip about those she doesn't. The last portion of the book is marginally more interesting than the first.	2002-02-08

Although this wasn't his best, even a 4 star story from my absolute favorite author is better than almost anything else I've read since his last book, Straight Man. And, of course there is no comparison to (Nobody's) Fool or (The Risk) Pool. Empire Falls returns us to the declining, small, blue collar town and inhabitants that are so genuinely yet captivatingly ordinary, where RR is at his best. The only awkwardness was the unexpected school scene. Much more blatant than any other event in any Russo novel. But, it is the everyday friendships of those involved, that provides the Russo touch, even when the going is gruesome.  Thinking of the antics of Miles' father still makes me laugh, weeks after I've finished. Is there a $20 bill in my glove compartment? What happened to the one I dropped in the collection basket?

The hero and villain were true to form. And Dr. Money is an evil villain, not because of his theoretical mistakes,which some reviewers have defended, but his inabilty to publicly recognize that the twins case was not a success. And, his willingness manipulate a human life to serve his own vanity. David's ability to maintain his sense of self, to overcome the farce of his first 14 years without bitterness for his parents or his brother is not only inspiring, but unusual in this age of victimization. His ability to love his wife and their children make him a hero who has overcome more than the routine obstacles of growing up. His ability to approach, then walk away from the physician who botched his original surgery, a sign of maturity and courage. I only wished he had confronted Dr. Money as well, and not walked away. True, the book's end focuses more on the whole gender identity and intersex quandary, rather than the very human elements that made it difficult to put down. But the 5 stars are earned, due not only to its readabilty, but for being a book that educates as well as captures the emotions.	2001-03-27

The preparation, the pressures,the sacrifice, the criticism (from those who never contribute anything other than their attendance on Friday night). How the smaller but better coached team can be a contender, can take on anyone and win. And, at least in this story, a balanced description of a dedicated coach, rather than the usual sterotypical &quot;win at all costs&quot; depiction. The author shows tremendous respect for all he characterizes on the team he follows and the town of Odessa. But he does so while still revealing all their flaws. The tragic outcome of passion gone awry is saved for the opposing team or the teams of subsequent years. After reading this, some will be glad that they don't live in Odessa, others would want to move there to take part in the tradition.	2000-10-20
