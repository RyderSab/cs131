Real life drama	I became introduced to this case through court TV and many documentaries, and all I can say is WOW!!!! No matter what you feel about the victims or Betty, you have to feel for the children who were put through this. I was heartbroken while reading this book. It has the same feel of the book I read for the movie \\"Goodfellas\\" and you do sort of feel caught up in the mess. It's sad really, but it's a teaching lesson if you look it at in a positive light.	2005-08-29

The title struck me right away and I remembered reading it years ago. Taking a bit of time to relax back, I really found myself re-enjoying this novel.<br /><br />Pierce Kingston is a famous movie star. He makes twelve million for a picture, but some crazed fan has been harrassing him, making his family anxious. In comes Nikki, the bodyguard.<br /><br />Okay, now the story line is a bit cliched so I gave it four stars, but you really can't help but to enjoy this one. Just Another Pretty Face has all the elements. Hot guy, hot girl, hot sex ... what more can you ask for.<br /><br />Take a chance on an oldie but goodie.	2005-08-15

Though I still read 'traditional' romance novels, I think the engaging and different story lines plus the hot, hot sex bring an extra zing that a lot of stories are missing now and days.<br /><br />Shattered is just that type of novel. Alex Houston is a dancer and college student struggling through life when one freak night introduces her to the man of her dreams, Steven Macmillan. They have a passionate (and I mean passionate) interlude that leaves them both yearning for more, but it takes a year for the two of them to hook up again. What follows from there is an engaging tale of how preconcieved notions, fate and great sex can snatch up even the most aware person.<br /><br />Although I own this book in both formats, I was really amped to see it on Amazon and I purchased my copy because it's definitely one for both my shelves.	2005-08-13

Continually, she manages to inject a new dose of humor and intrigue.<br /><br />Seize the Night is just another example of great, humourous writing from an author who is fast becoming one of the best.<br /><br />This latest contribution to the DH saga is about Valerius, the Dark Hunter who you may remember from previous books. If you thought you wouldn't want to read about the pompous, former Roman general...then you better think again. Kenyon really introduces this tragic hero in a great fashion. His pysche and character pull you in right from the start.<br /><br />While out on patrol, Valerius runs afoul of Tabitha Devereaux, the cheeky, human Daimon hunter. At first, he doesn't know what to make of this totally unconventional woman. She is wierd, has strange friends, and is the sister-in-law to his mortal enemy. So, why in the world is he falling in love with her?<br /><br />Kenyon makes this story very appealing with the addition of some new characters, the creation of a new Dark Hunter and...best of all...some very revealing tid bits about Ash, the leader of the Dark Hunters.<br /><br />I read the entire book in one sitting, and I just cracked it open for the second time. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment.<br /><br />Buy Seize the Night! You won't be disappointed.	2004-12-31

If you haven't been introduced to this intriguing and fascinating world, don't worry. The author provides plenty of background so you don't get lost.<br /><br />The book begins with Were-Hunter, Vane Kattalakis, distraught over the death of his sister, and the injury sustained to his brother who now lies comatose. All of Vane's life he has had to fight for what he wants and needs. Growing up in a wolf pack is definitely for the dogs, especially when both your mother and father hate you...and have tried to kill you at least once.<br /><br />Vane is steadily growing tired of the struggle. And, now without the companionship of his brother and sister...and with a death bounty on his head, he just wants to find a little peace. He doesn't expect a human woman to fulfill his desire, but in Bride McTierney, Vane finds all he ever needs.<br /><br />Bride is a sweet, compassionate woman who has just been dumped by her loser ex-boyfriend. She just wants someone to love her for her. When she meets Vane, Bride is a little scared of his intense and passionate nature. She has never met anyone like him...someone with magic powers, shapeshifting abilities...and stamina that can only be dreamed about. Yet, it isn't easy knowing your boyfriend is a dog, literally.<br /><br />This was such a wonderful book! I immediately rushed out to buy the rest of the series. The dialogue, wit, and humor is very funny. And, Vane makes this one a definite keeper. A true Alpha with a heart of gold, he makes you want to start looking for your own Were-Hunter.<br /><br />Check this out! You won't be disappointed.	2004-08-10

I will never forget this book, and for as long as I can see straight I will always read it at least once a month, just because I love it so much.<br />I absolutely adore this book, it makes me cry. And, for a Harlequin that is less then 60k in words it really hit home.<br />Daniel and Rachael are happily married with three children. Their life is that of a young couple fully involved in the joy and angst of raising a family. One day Rachael receives a call telling her Daniel has been unfaithful. As a devoted wife and mother, she is devasted and heartbroken. But, can she end their marriage and end their love.<br />My word! This book is so good. I was crying, laughing and steaming through every word. You experience the inside of the relationship from Daniel's prospective and Rachael's prospective.<br />This is a wonderful book during the age where Harley books were great. Now they're just copykats, but don't let that diminish the glory of this novel. Find this at the library, buy it used...do what you have to find this book.	2004-07-11

I have read through the reviews here and I am a bit surprised at some of the vehemence on display.<br />Hot Pink is not that bad, albeit it is a bit unbelievable.<br />Chloe and Rocco meet, hook up for a one night stand, and a couple of weeks later fall in love. But, during their two week escapade they have quite a few snags to get over. The first being Rocco's girlfriend...whose not quite a girlfriend, some arm wrestling, and the trials of trying to start a business. Yet, in the end, love does conqueror all...of course.<br />I, personally, found the book to be witty and well written. I laughed out loud at some of Chloe's comments, and overal SJ did a good job of making her somewhat believable. Rocco, who is described as drop dead gorgeous, was a little harder to buy, but it's not so bad that he is way out there in left field. It's definitely Sex in the City-ish, complete with the duo of companionable friends and liberated sexual views. Overall, it was a good book to take to the beach and read. Plus, the cover is cool. I don't know if that counts for anything, but it helped.<br />I did have one major problem with the book though. When Chloe and Rocco first hook up they don't use a condom. Now, IMHO, that is absolutely nutty especially since at the time they hadn't known each other but five minutes. But, I am not such a prude to let it sway me from the book, or let it raise my moral hackles to the point of outrage. It's a book of fiction...not a guide to life. Yet, they continue having sex without a condom, and except for one very small thought from Rocco nothing else about birth control is mentioned. I just found that way wierd. And, I feel like something should have been mentioned. Not doing so was a huge oversight.<br />But, aside from that...the read was pleasant. Try it out for yourself...you might like it.	2004-07-04

In this story we are introduced to the first female vampire hunter, Destiny, and her lifemate Nicholae. Of course, the plot follows the usual storylines...no great surprise there. Though, there is a slight twist because instead of the usual brooding male Carpathian, we get to see a brooding female Carpathian.<br />Destiny is conflicted because she's been turned Carpathian by a vampire who murdered her mother and father. The dastardly blood sucker held her hostage, terrorizing and torturing her mind. Yet, she was such a stong pyschic that she was able to link cosmically with a mysterious being who helps her escape.<br />To save her from the clutches of the vampire, Nicolae trained Destiny to hunt and kill as a means of protection until he could find her. Though they share a bond, Destiny is unsure if she can actually trust him, so throughout the years she has never responded back to his haunting voice. When they finally meet, Destiny has to learn to conqueror her fears and trust in herself, or risk losing him forever.<br />I got to be honest. I'm actually giving this book three stars because it's better then the three contributions to the series that came before it. Dark Symphony, Dark Melody, and the story in the anthology The One and Only...sorry forgot which Dark one that was...were absolutely trifling in their stupidity. Those books left such a horrible impression in my mind that I had no expectations for this book what-so-ever. I didn't even know it was out till I just happened to glance by it at the store.<br />Seriously, I am thinking of hanging up my hat with the Dark series...or at least stop spending my money and dust off my library card. This book is just tired, and it didn't do anything for me. Plus, I am sick to death of Ms. Feehan using her books as some type of platform for whatever cause she's currently on. She didn't do that early on in the series, but since Dark Legend she's been on this kick. The romance is lost in whatever statement she's trying to make...IMHO. It's not a totally unpleasant read, so you can give it a try. Just don't expect it to knock your socks off.n this kick. The romance is lost in whatever statement she's trying to make...IMHO.

I really remember her, and I remember liking her very much.<br />Kate didn't know when she first met Tair at the joining of her best friend, Sharon and his brother in the story of 'Seduction', that he was planning to claim her. LOL...when she is 'served' with papers stating she must report to the 'claming' center she is ready to crack some skulls. As a high powered lawyer, she isn't scared. So, she chooses what any woman of her ilk would chose...Challenge.<br />Tair and Kate are exciting, and their romance is hot. As with 'Seduction' there are many aspects of her relationship with Tair that must be worked out. Plus, Kate has her own insecurities.<br />Seriously, this is a good book, and wonderful follow up to 'Seduction'. Though, you could read this as a stand alone, it would help to read Oath of Seduction first. The ritual of the claiming is explained properly, so you won't be lost as to what it means. And, the author leaves you sufficiently hanging with the next story of the Oath series. I have been waiting on pins and needles to read this story for a while.<br />Overall, this is a very good book.	2004-06-21
US	45562164	R17SNCR7VRJHYU	1843603942	178572308	Warrior	Books	4	39	40	N	N	Two very good stories	I was actually quite pleased with both of the stories in this anthology.<br />\\"The War Lord\\" by Jaid Black is quite entertaining, if a bit unexplained. Janet, the heroine, is transported back in time to when real Scottish men wore kilts and killed with swords. It seems she lands smack-dab in the middle of a real Highland raid. Of course, at first, she isn't sure her eyes aren't playing tricks on her but when she is unceremoniously scooped up in the large arms of the hero, Euan, she realizes it isn't a dream.<br />Euan and Janet were really cute together, and of course their love scenes are typical JB HOT! This is a true romance erotica, with just enough flair and pancea to make it rememberable, if albeit a bit unexplainable.<br />\\"Keiran the Black\\" is also a another good story of unexpected time travel. Templeton does a good job with the story, and adds some very funny and different twists.<br />Elizabeth is transported back in time by grasping a magically enchanted sword. Amazingly, and quite interestingly, she is transported into the body of a young and naive 18 year old who has been wed to Kieran by force in the middle ages. It doesn't take long for Elizabeth, who in her previous life had been a sexually frustrated 39 year old woman, to accept the gift she's been given (Heck! I wouldn't mind being 18 years old again, but with the experience and knowledge of a forty year old) Easily giving up the pleasure of modern convenience for a chance at a new life, she works on trying to dissect the animal magnetism of her husband, Keiran.<br />For a bit of light reading, cause both stories are pretty short, this is a good book. The romance is stong in both stories, and the sex scenes are erotic and satisfying.	2004-06-21

Her partner was killed in the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and she is longing to find a new partner. In a bookstore, she meets a kindred spirit who calls to her lonliness.<br />Now, this is where the story gets real interesting. The hero and the heroine are both fascinated with the world of BDSM. So, the growth of their love really takes place over one weekend, where the two spend...and interesting time learning and discovering about what fascinates them sexually. But, although the heroine feels for the hero, she is looking for something different. She is looking for a man who can be both dominate and submissive, which I suppose in the underground world of BDSM is called a 'switch'. Is the hero the person she is looking for?<br />Well, you'll have to read that for yourself.<br />Personally, I thought the book was okay. The writing wasn't bad, and for the first half of the story I was a bit intrigued. Yet, the more I read, the more I became bored with the story. I just couldn't get into the whole 'switch' thing going on. It really broke the flow of the read for me, and made me question rather the heroine was really in love with the hero.<br />I give this first part of the book two stars.<br />\\"Oath of Seduction\\" is the best of the two. I remember this book a lot better because it was actually good.<br />Sharon is an earth woman bound by a contract the planet has with a neighboring race of aliens. The have a pact that exchanges woman for technology and the such. Of course, this may sound a bit archaic, but it's not like the woman aren't given a chance to resist. To make it fair, the woman can choose to be seduced, challenged, or conquerored.<br />Sharon chooses to be seduced, so Liken, the hero, has a month to seduce her into saying. What you find out later, is that the aliens aren't just picking women at random. They spend years looking for their soulmate, a woman who can bond with their mind and body. Sharon is Liken's mate, so now he has a month to seduce her into knowing it. Yet, there is a catch, and...well...it's a different kind of catch. You'll just have to read it too find out what I mean.<br />There are some elements of the paranormal because Liken has the ability to look into Sharon's mind. But, the author doesn't focus on that. Sharon's inability to deal with the changes in her life, and her problems with totally accepting all the changes taking place are really fascinating. The story is totally believable, even though it is a sci-fi/paranormal.<br />I enjoyed the story, so I give it 4 starss to be seduced, so Liken, the hero, has a month to seduce her into saying.

I decided to buy the physical book because it is actually really good, and I wanted to see it on my shelf.<br />As many another reviewer has said, &quot;the title does say it all&quot;. Regina, our heroine, is set up by her lovable friends with the date of her life. They are determined to have her live out some of her deepest, darkest fantasies.<br />At a costume party, where she was supposed to be set up with the first of her 'fantasy fix' she meets Dimitri. And, let me tell you, he is all the fixing for the fantasy Regina needs. But, what she doesn't know is our dominant and lovable hero is a vampire, and she is soul mate.<br />Interestingly, this isn't a dark and descending story, which is normally what you find when you read books with vampires as the hero. This book is funny, laugh at loud funny at times. Regina, her friends, and Dimitri friend's are hilarious. Add in the up and downs of the budding relationship, and you have a really good story.<br />Yet, I gave the book four stars because I found Regina's acceptance of some of the things Dimitri could do a bit unbelievable. I mean she accepted that he could speak in her mind before she even knew he was a vampire. I also gave it four stars because the book is very short for the price you will pay. But, it is very good, don't get me wrong.<br />If you have a little extra cash and can suspend some of your normal belief requirements then this is the book for you.	2004-06-21

I was looking for a romance story with a fun, vampiric element. I did get the vampiric element, but I found the humour to be a bit underdeveloped and at times very childish. I think there were only three or four parts where I laughed out loud.<br />Plus, romance books based strictly in the first person are confusing and difficult at best. I have only read two to date that are worthy.<br />I have the sequel to this book, and deep inside I am hoping it offers more then this first one did. Interestingly, the author gives thanks to Christine Feehan whose Dark series are the hottest vampire romances on the market. And, although CF's books have been lacking of late, please don't look to this book to offset what you haven't been recieving in a Feehan book.<br />If you are looking for fun vampire romance in the first person then I suggest Mary Janice Davidson's &quot;Undead and Unwed&quot;. That book is absolutely hilarious.	2004-05-27

And, I just don't mean in Christine Feehan's latest contribution to her Carpathians.<br />Seriously, I love this series. The first seven books were fabulous! I would recommend them to anyone. But, the last two books, Dark Symphony and Dark Melody, are just downright idiotic. I wish I could say one good thing about this book, but I can't. The writing is horrible. The plot is horrible. The h/h are horrible. To put it plainly, the entire book is horrible.<br />In Dark Melody, Dayan, a hero from a previous books finds his lifemate, Corrine. And, from there it's the same old trite villians seeking to destroy the pyschic female. The is the return of previous characters but even their addition seems lackluster and uninspiring.<br />Ultimately, the plot and storyline were a bit convulted.

I am an avid ebook reader, and I love steamy romance erotic fiction. Yet, this book was really neither.<br />The heroine is a frustrated doctor who searches for love on internet. She is looking for a Dom, or Dominant, who can fulfill all her wicked desires. What she doesn't know is the person she finds is a serial killer preying on women like her. Yet, the police are aware of the connection between the internet and the victims, and when the heroine is attacked they immediately make the connection. This brings the heroine into contact with the hero, a police detective, (...).<br />What follows is a basic premise replayed in numerous romances, both traditional and romance erotic. The detective moves in to protect her, and his Alpha ways fascinate the heroine. The have one very hot scene, but seriously that's it.<br />What disappointed me most about this novel is JB abandoned her roots for mainstream. She kept the story extremely tame. So, true readers of her work should be seriously dejected because it didn't stay true to what makes her a good writer. Also, to add to the burden of the read, the writings is really sub-par. Add that with a basic and underdeveloped storyline and you get 2 1/2 stars....maybe less if you are really trying to point out errors.<br />If you are a reader of romance erotica then you will be disappointed with this book. Simply because there isn't enough erotica to add with the romance. (...). If you are traditional romance reader looking for something different, you will be disappointed because the premise isn't different at all.<br />To be honest, this book really didn't please me.

If, however, you are looking for a book with true love then please...FOR THE LOVE OF GOD...pass this book on.<br />Marly and Cade have been destined to be. She's been in love with him since she was a little girl. Cade is older then Marly, and extremely protective of her. Yet, as she grows older his feeling become very sexual in nature. Since they aren't related by blood this isn't necessarily a bad premise. Most ole school readers have seen this replayed in Harlequin books of the past. LOL...But this is where the old school and the 'new school' come into play.<br />Cade has been abused in the past. The author doesn't really go into detail explaining this abuse, but somehow it makes him want to 'share' his women with his two younger brothers. And, when I say share...I MEAN SHARE IN THE MOST ULTIMATE SENSE.<br />I'll be honest...the sex is hot...but that's all there is to it. I could not relate to a male, alpha or otherwise, who gets some kick in sharing his woman. I find that gross and disgusting. And, any true man who love his woman would not want to share. Cade's relationship with Marly is borderline incest, and too disgusting to be true love. Though, the sex is hot. If you dig this...then purchase this book as an erotica only. But, don't fool yourself into thinking this is a romance with erotic overture.<br />You will be sorely disappointed.	2004-05-27

What an exciting and fantastic read. This book is very different from JKR's other books, but you see a difference that lingers in your mind long after you finish reading the last page.<br />The book starts with a very hot summer, and Harry stuck on Privet Drive with the horrible Durselys. Young Mr. Potter's world is just recovering from the events of Year Four, and Harry is trying to move on with his life. Yet, a sudden attack by Dementors leave him shaken and confused. Not soon after Harry is taken to a secure place because he-who-shall-not-be-named is on the loose and Harry's life is in peril. When Harry returns to Hogwarts to rumors it's to rumors that he is mad and unbalanced. I can't really say anymore because I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say that Harry is changing. Not only is he growing older, but unfamiliar feelings and emotions begin to bombard Harry. Our young hero has to deal with being a 15 year old famous wizard, who isn't sure about himself or where he belongs. You see a different Harry and sometimes you may not be so happy with the changes. Yet, the great things is you understand and feel for Harry. Life is moving fast in a direction he isn't sure of, and puberty is just one of his problems. I recommend that you read this latest version of the-boy-who-lived and see for yourself what all the fuss is about.	2003-06-23

This has to be one of the best historical romances ever written, if not one of the best in the genre period. The story has all the usual medieval tags, ie. forced marriage, wounded (...) hero, sweet virginal heroine, and wicked villian (family member), but its the unusual tags of the story that did it for me. Kenric is absolutely to DIE FOR! His emotional turmoil as well as his feelings for Tess vibrate right off the pages. Tess is also not your standard heroine. She is sweetly naive and sometimes really stupid, but you like her and can understand her reluctance. I don't know what else to say about this story except it is one of the best books I have ever read. Sadly, I haven't seen much else from this author. She has two continuation books, one that deals with Kenric's half brother and another that deals with his descendant. They are good, but this book surpasses them by far.	2003-06-21

This book lacked any sort of premise and it went completely south when it started to introduce numerous characters (who really didn't need to be there) and numerous sub plots (that frankly didn't make sense). I didn't particulary like the hero, and the heroine got on my nerves very quickly. I had to force myself to finish a story that is barely 150 pages long. Someone needs to tell Ms. Feehan that Alpha males are what makes the Carpathian men so yummy. You don't abandon a winning formula half through the game. The sad fact is I have little anticipation for Dark Melody which is Dayan's story because the plot is so outrageous. I only hope that someone gives her a quick check on reality so she can return to writing the stories that readers truly love. Unfortunately, I was so disgusted with Feehan's story that I didn't even bother to read the other two. After the horrible beginning from CF I throw the book in the MAT Pile (Maybe Another Time Pile).	2003-06-21

As a lover of writing and reading, I have appreciated the subtle nuances of Rowling's work. I came to read her series because I thought the movies were very sweet and interesting. Books 1-3 are very enjoyable, and highly entertaining; however, with this fourth book Rowlings out did herself. I must say that this is one of best books I have ever read.<br />I cried, laughed, and was jumping off my couch while reading. The fact that it is simply done enhances the emotional low and highs. JKR's vivid detail is engaging and I couldn't put the book down, literally. I started reading for a bit of fun, and eighteen hours later I was wishing that I had Book 5.<br />Unlike JKR's previous novels, the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" dispenses with a lot of its redundancy (as explained by another reviewer). Here the reader is taken to a very large fork in a road in the world of Witches and Wizards. We are given our greatest insight, and I was astounded and breathless.<br />I won't give away much of the plot, but I will say that everything is not as it seems for Harry. Friendship, loyalty, and conceived notions are threatened for our young friend. Beginning with his ill concealed delight to attend a World Cup Quidditch match with the Weasley's, where young Potter is introduced to the varying world of witchcraft. Yet, Voldemort has more in store for Harry, and characters of old and new faces must choose between understanding, or death. I refuse to give away more. You will have to buy the book and read for yourself.<br />On a separate note, I am twenty-six year old female and lover of literature. I applaud everyone who even attempted to read this book, especially children. I don't understand what all the fuss is about, but pull your head out the sand folks. This is a great book, emphasis on book. It is an imaginary world that is really nothing more then a microcosm of our own. Magik is what gives it the spice of life, but all the more subtle and finer points is what brings it to life. When I have children they will definitely be reading these stories. Matter of fact, I may have to speed up the process so I can get started reading again.<br />Happy Readingchildren they will definitely be reading these stories. Matter of fact, I may have to speed up the process so I can get started reading again.<br />Happy Reading	2003-04-14

I would have given the book 4 stars, because although it's good it isn't the best JB I have read (I own all her books), but the price is way too much.

The only parts I found exciting were the references to other Carpathians. I wasn't particularly enthused by Byron or his lifemate. They didn't spark anything in me. Ms. Feehan's last books were exciting because of the dominance and possessiveness of the male. In trying to add freshness to her story she lost the main formula and what makes the Carpathians so intriguing. Additionally, what the heck was up with the Jaguars or &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;. It was almost like she throw that one in for effects. I like the Scarletti Curse (the actual book not the one mentioned in Dark Symphony) and I have read it a few times. How come none of this was mentioned in that book? How come the curse is something different now? It made absolute no sense whatsoever, and I was left scrambling for the other book to make sure I hadn't missed anything. Also there was a lot of inconsistent dialouge between the main characters. One minute they are talking like two Victorian prudes and the next they are using everyday common language and slang. It was almost like there were two different books in one book. Overall the book was boring and slow, and not a good testament to Feehan or her Dark series. I haven't given up on her yet, but I am going to be a lot more critical about buying her purchases from now on.	2003-03-06
US	45562164	R16RMSCMV448T8	0060002697	224634936	The Lily and the Sword	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Decent Read	Lily and the Sword is a good read, albeit it is predictable.<br />Lily is a conquerored woman who in seeking shelter from the destruction of war. She inevitably falls right into the hands of her enemy, The King's Sword, Radulf.<br />Radulf is attracted to Lily, even though he knows that she is hiding something. He tries to resist her lure, but fails miserably.<br />When Lily's secret is revealed the the two commence battle. They don't trust each other and are weary of the other's motives. They eventually conqueror this distrust by way of a forced marriage and love saves the day.<br />This story has been replayed numerous times you don't even need to read the ending to figure it out.<br />Bennett does succeed in infusing a significant amount of emotion in to her characters in the beginning of the novel. It is just enough to make you continue to read on. Before the inevitable occured, I was in love with Radulf and his torment over his feelings for Lily. I also understood why Lily was doing what she was doing. Yet, Saxon maid and Norman conqueror has been played before. So about half way through the novel as things between Lily and Radulf began to detoriate, I was tempted to put it down. Yet, I stayed the course and it did turn out to be a pleasant read. Nothing spectacular but it will do to pass the time.	2003-02-26

The simple fact that there is a continuation struck me as odd. I won't give away the ending of HE, but I could have swore their story was finished. As we discover in HI this simply isn't the case. Once again this book is a testimony that sex scenes do not make the romance. Everything about this story was absolutely ridiculous. I won't go into detail about the story because I am sure there are plenty of other reviews doing that. I will say, however, that this booked surpassed kooky and entered into the realm of silly. I got bored real quick with the antics of Zanita and Tyber by the 3rd chapter. The crazy thing is it got worse and I!!!! kept reading. I can only say that I was hoping for something better from one of my favorite authors. Considering this is the fourth sub-par performance from DJ, I am skeptical of buying any of her other books that DO NOT DEAL WITH THE MATRIX OF DESTINY. If I could give this book a 1/2 a star I would. It was that bad! If you are dying to read it for yourself. I would suggest taking a trip to the library and saving yourself a few bucks for something else more worth your time.	2003-02-20

Julian is a wondering Carpathian who is nearly ready to give up on his endless, immortal existence. He is asked as a favor to protect a singer that is being hunted by deadly killers intent on destroying her and her band. Yet, to his surprise there is more to this singer then is first apparent, and love and possession are definitely in the air once he gets a whiff of her.<br />There is a lot of purple prose that start to work your nerves through out, but overall this book is a testimony to a new fresh perspective in romance. CF has the competition beat by a mile with her Carpathian series. Dara Joy is probably the only other author that comes close. If you want to get started on the Dark series I recommend reading them in order, although that is not a prerequiste. Most of the books are enjoyable by themselves. It's just that the names, times, and themes begin to make more sense if you read them in order.	2003-02-19

I read each of the Matrix of Destiny books on pins and needles. I love them so much I own two copies of each, yet this book was something else entirely. Unfortunately I can't state it quite the way I would like to because I doubt if Amazon[.com] would post my comments then. The characters were flat and uninspiring, especially the main characters. The concept of the story is interesting, but I find it hard to feel any sexual tension with a male character who is completely dominated by women. I mean lets keep it real here. We read romance novels for the men. If there aren't hot then the story isn't going to work. Jorlan was cute, but he seemed more like a boy then a man and I simply do not get off on boys. I give this book one star because as a few have suggested there seems to be a veiled reference to the Matrix of Destiny series.	2003-02-16

TIME MOVES FAST). I was a little disappointed with this book because I thought she had taken kooky to a different level. I expected to hear the Addams family theme every time I turned the page. It was okay. Not here best, but I did enjoy the book as a light hearted read. It didn't make my imagination wonder like the Matrix of Destiny books, but it was fun. I give this book 3 stars because there were some pretty hot scenes and overall it was pretty funny.	2003-02-16

I bought this book solely on the reference to Erik the Learned. I sat on it a while because suspense romance, unless it is written by Linda Howard, isn't my thing. Yet, I can say that this book is great. For those you us who have waited with baited breath for Erik's story this novel delivers. It doesn't give the full story and there are many pieces that are left undiscovered, but I think the true story is in the parallel that takes place between the modern-day Serena and Erik. I was very disappointed to learn that EL probably won't be writing any more historical novels and that is where my true preferences leans, but I am going to take some time to feret out a few of her other books, in particular the Donovan series. I haven't read the books but I am looking forward to reading them. For those of you who are leary of reading about a modern day Erik take heart. This book gives you all you need while still retaining the mysteriousness of the fictional man we have all come to love. I give this book 5 stars because it was a truly a good book.	2003-02-15

Ranulf and Reina (loved her name by the way) are hilarious. Once again JL delights the reader with her witty dialouge and humourous escapes. This is one of those the books that I read at least once or twice a year. I highly recommend this book for beginning JL fans and novice romance readers. You will not be disappointed. True veterans like myself probably already own two or three copies and are nodding their heads in agreement. Happy Reading!	2003-02-01

I can still remember the fascination I had when I first read it. I immediately rushed out to buy a second copy because I was so afraid that something might happen to my first copy. What can I say except Lorgin and Deanna are wonderful. I fell in love with the two of them. Lorgin is the perfect Alpha-male without being super hard core like most. This is a wondeful book. Its a futuristic/Time-Space travel and can get a little tedious with all the terms and dimensions hocus pocus, but that doesn't detract from the story at all. In fact, as you continue on with the series it actually begins to make a little sense (smile). Probably because I was trying to \\"teleport\\" myself to thier world so I could find my own Avarian, but that is besides the point. Read this book! I guarantee you will love it. NOW WILL SOMEONE PLEASE WRITE MS. JOY AND TELL HER TO WRITE TRAED'S STORY. I AM TIRED OF WAITING!!!	2003-02-01

After that great book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the other stories. Well I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. All I kept thinking throughout the entire book was what a jerk Royce was. I just couldn't get past that. Don't get me wrong! I love Johanna Lindsey, and I don't think she can ever write a bad book. Her dialouge, wit, and humour is always apparent. Yet, this book just didn't cut it for me. I do recommend this book with a 3 star rating, but I also recommend reading the trilogy in order. Don't start at the end like I did.	2002-12-01

I will probably need to purchase a new book sometime soon because the one that I have is almost falling apart. This is a pretty old book. I think it was written in the early nineties. The formula for the story (Norman Knight and Saxon peasant) has been used before, but the author works their magic in a special way. With most historical romances of this period. You begin to feel ambivalent toward the hero or heroine. Not with in this book!! You understand the reasons for the heroine's anxiety, and you also understand the pov of the hero. I highly recommend this book.	2002-12-01
US	45562164	RER4SPZ7D0BSI	084395048X	315047773	Lair of the Lion	Books	1	8	9	N	N	Not Good	First off, let me start by saying that I had read an excerpt from this book a few months before it was actually released. The beginning seemed so good that I pre-ordered the book and checked my mail box every day eagerly awaiting its arrival. However, when the book finally arrived I was left wishing I could send it back. The first parts of the book started off so well, but after that everything just diminished. I give the book one star because the sex scenes did indeed sizzle, but this book is a definite testimony that great sex scenes don't make the book.<br />The plot was extremely weak. This whole re-write thing of beauty and the beast was tired and boring. Secondly, the curse left a lot to be desired. The constant peril of the heroine became silly by 6 chapter. The hero seemed whiny and tiresome. Overall, the book was boring.... It took me nearly 3 weeks to finally finish the book.	2002-12-01

I do however have to agree with a previous reviewer that the plot was a little thin. Yet, this book has something that many romances are lacking today. Along with some pretty steamy sex scenes and great dialouge there is EMOTION. This is the third book of GF's that I have read so far, and although Lord of Ice is still my favorite of her works. This book measured up. I truly felt for the plight of Belinda and the ever faithful Robert. There were times I wanted to slap his face and times I wanted to wring her neck, but I felt it throughout the entire novel. I love romances, but today's crop aren't measuring up. I can hardly ever finish a book in its entirety without skimming or eventually putting it down because it is lame and stupid. This book kept me there till the end. I gave it 4 stars, which is a pretty high rating for me, because it was good. I would have given it 5, but the plot seemed a little wierd. Overall, it was good and I definitely recommend it.	2002-11-15

Of late she has been moving toward the erotic side of romance, and away from the traditional aspects of the genre. If you like steamy, kinky sex scenes this book is for you. I personally enjoyed the book. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't really understand what was going on between Caroline and Simon. I thought she should have delved a little further into their past, but since it is obvious that Caroline was about 12 or 13 when her sexual escapades began. I understand why she stayed away from it. Overall, the book is what it is. It is erotica. I had to join in after reading a couple of the previous reviews. The book wasn't bad. It just isn't erotic romance like her other books. It is pure erotica. Take it or leave it.	2002-10-17

The story of Tom and Elizabeth is great. I read their story a long time ago in a Summer Sizzler. I lost the book when my baggage was lost on a plane. I nearly cried. Elizabeth is strong but fragile, an interesting mix for the heroine. The trauma of her past has made her gun shy with men, especially Tom. If you like LH then this is must read. It is one of her earlier works so if your looking for something new then look elsewhere. Beware!
