It has in it what every screenwriter really needs when getting into this game, and that is the formatting specifications.  This tells you what kind and size font to use (12-point Courier), where to set the margins (one inch top and bottom, half an inch on the right, one and a half on the left to accomodate the binding brads), how wide the dialogue passages are supposed to be, all complete with examples you can see for yourself, all things that fool Syd Field never considered to be of value during his incessant ramblings about CHINATOWN.  Any creative writing class can teach you about story structure, but this will give you that professional appearance you'll need to actually get the door open.	2005-10-08

It lacked the feel of the previous eight books written by Max Allan Collins, who was able to duplicate the visual style verbally.  In fact, it came off like Kaminsky had taken one of his own novels and just written in Mac and Stella and the rest of the gang into it to turn it into a CSI:NY book without even watching the show beforehand, much like how [[ASIN:B0007P0XBO Ocean's Twelve]] started life as two original screenplays that were merged together and had the previous characters dropped into it.  Hopefully Collins is brought back in to do the next CSI:NY book.	2005-09-16

An absurd, slapstick and self-deprecating fictional autobiographical account of the modern moviemaking process, this follows Bruce in his preparation for what's ultimately a bit part as a sagacious doorman in a prestigious romance film that quickly spirals out of control.  It's hilarious to see how seriously Bruce takes his preparation for this part: he spends a day as a doorman...and ends up on the Terrorist Watch List after a mishap with Colin Powell's Secret Service retinue; he wrote his character's backstory as being southern, so he goes down to Richmond, Virginia to drink in the local color at a gentleman's club (i.e. not a strip joint)...and ends up getting challenged to a duel; his character is a matchmaker, so he goes to work for some wedding planners...and the redneck NASCAR stereotypes for the lucky couple and their families abound; he goes shopping for an appropriate midlife crisis car for Richard Gere's character...and the dealership blows up.  At the same time, Bruce takes time to downplay his own image, such as how his whole ladies'-man image comes from the screenwriters and that he pretty much married the first woman who came onto him, that all the weapons training he received for his assorted roles didn't prepare him at all for dueling, and that Rat Pack swinger types who haven't gotten the message that Frank & Dino are long gone could've invested all of that time and effort spent on their techniques into other, more worthwhile hobbies and women would eventually find them.  Plus there's a lot of hilarious pictures throughout it, such as joke movie posters based on whatever Bruce is commenting on at the time, an illustration of the difference between A- and B-movie actresses(...), and a lot of ancillary characters who bear a distinct resemblance to Bruce.<br /><br />Oh, and don't call him \\"Ash.\\" He prefers \\"Foyl.\\"	2005-07-25

Comic-book superheroes and supervillains are real, and once one of their battles resulted in the complete eradication of San Francisco, they're all declared persona non grata in the US and told to leave lest they be shot on sight by the assorted Metanormal Tactical Units (\\"MTacs\\") of every major police department in the country. The principal character, Officer Soledad O'Roark, is a bit of a renegade and a hothead, but is also an engineering genius by designing a variety of highly unauthorized ordnance delivered by an equally unauthorized O'Dwyer Variable Lethality Law Enforcement gun (a real device from Australia with a theoretical fire rate of 1 million rounds a minute) to take out the \\"freaks\\" as they're now called: white phosphorous rounds for the Human Torch types, contact poison rounds for the Thing types, composite rounds for the Magneto types, and \\"barrel-launched adaptive munition\\" guided smart rounds for the Flash types. The only thing she doesn't have is a real defense against the Shadowcat-esque intangibles and the Professor X-like telepaths, the latter being the most dangerous because they've often had cops shoot themselves with their own guns, along with the politicians of the LAPD. From time to time it gets a little overly political, but it does provide you with what Senator Kelly and General Stryker were thinking.	2005-06-04

This provides all the hard evidence to show why 51% or so of the American electorate still chose to go with Bush despite his track record of failure and incompetence.  The contradictions and hypocrisies of the \\"moral\\" right are spelled out in detail with researched figures from the CDC, FEMA, and the Center For Rural Strategies: red states have a higher incidence of drug addiction, AIDS cases due to needle drug use, poverty, physical violence despite being the \\"Culture Of Life,\\" and general ignorance (almost 90% of 18-to-24-year-olds, the primary military recruiting demographic, can't find Iraq on a map).

While Laura Bush was able to get the crowd roaring, she was shredding Republicans at the time.  Even Dennis Miller was funnier when he was unafilliated and ripping both sides of the political divide a new one.<br />It read like Baer and Boeke had been ordered by their publisher to put out a counterargument to BLUE VS. RED, and they just dashed it off in a couple of hours so they could get an early start on the weekend.  While it does make you think at times, such as the fact that 1.78% of red staters are farmers, the rest of them are recycled from BLUE VS. RED with some subtle rewriting to fit the intended audience, and even then they're hit-or-miss.  When those recycled jokes aren't making the rare valid point (if red staters make up only 6% of American tourists overseas, who's more likely to be promoting the Ugly American stereotype?) they're working along the weak yeah-but rebuttal to ineffectively show superiority over blue staters (\\"Yeah, Britney Spears is perpetuating every trailer-trash stereotype out there, but at least she isn't having sex outside of marriage like Christina Aguilera!\\").  Even the Blue Stater Ten Commandments read like the Red Stater ones from BLUE VS. RED with only a handful of word changes.<br /><br />If you want good Democrat mocking, you're going to have to go to an independent comedian or even an insider giving his crew the Carl Hiaasen treatment, such as stuff on THE DAILY SHOW or pre-sellout Dennis Miller.ler.	2005-04-18

The best part is at the end, explaining how to recreate the living conditions of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in your own home (set up a tent in the most crime-infested part of town and tell the locals you're there to help them while wearing body armor and packing heat).

Based on the rather reiterative fore- and afterwords by DC Fontana and Gerrold, respectively, this installment of the Star Wolf's misadventures is a bit of a catharsis for Gerrold regarding the headaches he received trying to get this story filmed as an episode of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.  The book is interspersed with sharp jabs at the Star Trek franchise, such as Captain Parsons' previous posting, the &quot;Big E&quot; (the US Navy's nickname for the Enterprise) being too valuable to risk on the front lines due to potential morale problems if it's destroyed, and one of the Norway's doomed crewmembers being named M. Okuda, after TNG production staffer Michael Okuda; I also suspect that the Norway's AI &quot;LENNIE&quot; is named after Roddenberry's lawyer who shot down the episode in preproduction.  The death of one recurring character wasn't a surprise if you'd read the Star Wolf Briefing Book, which had marked said character for death.  The complaints about it not reading like the earlier Star Wolf books do have merit, since this is technically a novelization of a teleplay, but I was able to shrug it off because I've been experiencing similar with novelizing a screenplay of my own.	2004-06-05

It reads like a catharsis for Bochco about the shark-eat-shark nature of the entertainment industry, told second-person from the POV of a screenwriting agent, with far too much Mamet Dammit-level profanity to be considered hardboiled.  You'd think he would have picked something up from the NYPD BLUE technical advisors about law enforcement, but Bochco seems to be more focused on venting about the hand that feeds him.	2004-06-01

I always thought of myself as a good Step 9 driver: granted, it took me two tries to get my license, but I've had exactly one parking ticket, I've been pulled over exactly once and got off with a warning, and every dent and ding I've put into the car has been below the deductible and couldn't be reported to the insurance company.  After reading this book, it seems I am a bigger psychotic behind the wheel than I had known.  I never thought that most of the manuevers listed here were borderline vehicular suicide, and I was even taught how to do the Boston Left Turn (you pull halfway out into the road, blocking the traffic on your left until a car coming from the right lets you go) in driver's ed.  A lot of the diagrams are hilarious (you'll never make sense of Brighton intersection dynamics), and they also include the obligatory pedestrian scoring scale (you don't want to be Tom Menino or Mitt Romney).  The best part is the epilogue describing the future of Boston driving--by the end of this century, it will become an Olympic sport, and the Central Artery Tunnel will become a pedestrian shopping mall.	2004-04-13

Each tactic and method--some amusing, others possibly illegal--such as how to determine leaks in your company, how to determine mail tampering, how to use cellphones as eavesdropping tools, and how to infiltrate your competitors' meetings all come with little true-life examples of similar tactics being used in the field.

A lot of what happens in here seemed to be way too convenient and easy, like people who just happened to have requisite Bronze Age survival skills on the island before it was blown back in time, the era's locals having a high-enough learning curve to pick up English within a couple of months, the Coast Guard training barque Eagle being on scene and her lesbian captain scoring a hot blonde native babe, and practically the entire Nantucket town government and police department being on the mainland before the transition as well as the Massachusetts State Police's Nantucket barracks (a ready-made ground militia right there) not even making the journey.  There was also a fair amount of stupidity from some characters who wanted to commit some revisionism without fully understanding the situation, like a black Coast Guard cadet wanting to warn Africa about European slavers even though the great African kingdoms won't exist for a least another millennium, and one woman who wants to give the Olmecs a copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica to prepare for the conquistadores even though they literally don't understand English.<br />It was a good idea for a book that just didn't play out that well.	2002-11-11

The whole Order of the Raven plot is relegated to only a couple of throwaway scenes, and their main goal is to venerate Sara rather than expose her situation or kill her or anything else sinister.  Reading this made me understand why Yancy Butler wanted the Witchblade to only turn into an armored gauntlet on the show, as there is a rather sensual description of the Witchblade morphing into little more than an armored monokini over Sara's Anna Nicole Smith-like figure.<br />I'd recommend this only if you're a fan of the comic books.	2002-04-15

Harrison found a way to deviate from that with a small, seemingly insignificant event from the Civil War--in this case, Price Albert dying before he could talk Queen Victoria out of retaliating after a US Navy ship took two Confederate ambassadors off a British ship--and result in a totally different outcome other than CSA endurance.  While my own studies of the history of the British Empire in college made it easy to accept that the Brits' decision to take on both the Union and the Confederacy after mistaking the Stars & Bars over Mississippi for the Stars & Stripes over Maryland (an opinion of Harrison's possibly exacerbated by his living in Ireland), I had never known before that the combined forces of the Union and Confederacy were more than a match for the standing military of any European nation at the time.

It falls more in the category of fantasy rather than sci-fi in that you're asked to accept the situation at face value without any explaination of its mechanics; I couldn't figure out why the NAC was able to thrive with its philosophy of minimal-to-nonexistent official intervention, and the book doesn't seem to want to reveal the reasons.  Why no price gouging if Adam Smith's economic theory reigns supreme instead of John Maynard Keynes'?  Why no murder sprees killers could claim were justifiable homicides if everyone's required to pack heat?  Why no airplanes in a tech base that produced flatscreen TV two decades before ours?  Why won't a policy of requiring unanimous decisions on major issues result in a pattern of implicit dictatorship by one joker consistently voting against the grain and preventing the passage or revocation of a bill?  Did Shay's Rebellion, which showed the ineffectiveness of the Articles of Confederation, even occur in this universe?  Why aren't drugs addictive?  And if drugs are still addictive, why hasn't some Omar  Santiago wannabe used that scientific quirk to create a personal army and carve off a swatch of the NAC for himself?<br />The heavy politicization was also a turn-off--what's the point of making 1776 Anno Domini/Common Era into 1 Anno Liberatis (\\"year of freedom\\")?--as was the idea that the rule of law is what creates heinous acts, like airport metal detectors convincing terrorists to blow up airliners rather than hijack them.  The Copyright Office in Win's universe has an armed tactical unit?  I'd love to see what kind of heavily-armed death squads Smith gave the Departments of Agriculture and Education.<br />Having a Lexington minuteman ancestor and middle school classmates who were descended from John Adams and Benjamin Franklin also made this book rather heretical in my opinion.  I do not consider the Founding Fathers to have been evil masterminds bent on unfairly forcing Josiah Saltpork to [loud shocked gasp] kick back some of his livelihood to help pay for road repairs, as much as the Newington, New Hampshire secessionists would beg to differ.<br />Basically, I think this book is merely an example of how the Libertarian Party is little more than a bunch of petulant whiners with an overinflated sense of entitlement.

This book gave some credence to that: while zapping around the Milky Way in his spacefaring F-16 trying to find out who he is with priest Pater Tomm (I wonder if he's related to Circle AA officer Major Tomm from WINGMAN #4: THUNDER IN THE EAST), Hawk eventually finds the good ole USA--and that it and 35 other Earth nations were physically removed from Earth, deported to three dozen separate worlds in another part of the galaxy, and placed inside some sort of time-slowing field to hinder their progress towards developing spaceflight and learning the truth; there's some similar nationalism-suppression tactics similar to Red Star's New Order from the earlier WINGMAN books that reoccurs here, as well.  Hawk's mindwiping seems to not only have completely blanked his origins, but reprograms him with the customs and skills needed to function in the era he winds up in: he doesn't remember Twinkies or that cars need to be gassed up from time to time, or that you have to pay for both.

I especially loved the five-year plan section (everyone seems to suffer career death--or literal death in the case of the Producer--except for Writer/Directors).	2001-10-14

Kebron's ultra-dry wit remains in full force with instances like &quot;Bartender? Another one if you're not too busy,&quot; when the ship is performing radical manuevers and everyone else is being flung across the compartment. Shelby and Calhoun's pre-Excalibur relationship is explored a little as well. There's even a visit from a VOYAGER character, and a subtle reference to the BABYLON 5 spinoff CRUSADE.	2001-08-24

It comes off as a remake of RED STORM RISING: aggressor Communist nation makes a move on NATO territory to steal oil, but modernizes it with using China as the invader and Russia as the victim.  The Jack Ryan Administration continues to follow the path of common decency and creative occupations for some of its staffers--First Lady Cathy is still doing eye surgery at Johns Hopkins, the kids get taken to school in a VH-60 Blackhawk helo, Jack wants out of the job despite actually running for election, and his VP (who shall remain nameless for now) has certain ideas about how Air Force Two should be operated when ferrying him around the country.  There's also a bit of a tirade on missile defense from the POV of Al Gregory, who's working on the problem aboard the Aegis cruiser USS Gettysburg.	2001-08-17

TITANIC Captain Edward Smith has taken up residence here (permanently cursing the iceberg), and Alexander the Great tried to take over the place and got exiled.<br /> What makes this series interesting is not only how they let you inside the heads of each captain, but that the bar changes appearance for every visitor: Calhoun sees it as a Xenexian tavern, while Picard sees it as a French inn.  In terms of characterization, the best story would have to be Calhoun's, because he completely drops his borderline-savage/space-cowboy facade and shows some real sentiment.  The multi-franchise miniseries also ties in with the &quot;Invasion!&quot; tetralogy by having Sisko meet Klingon Captain Sotugh from &quot;The Soldiers of Fear&quot; and Janeway run into an alien similar to the vaguely Satanic Zennor from &quot;First Strike.&quot;  Hardcore Trek fans should enjoy the Christopher Pike entry, which gives a hint as to what his XO's name was.	2001-08-07

It coexists with his previous POWER novels with the President mentioning that the Letter of Reprisal and Rules of Capture are not options this time around.  In addition to Huston's creative interpretations of Article I Section 8 of the US Constitution, it also gives people the notion that Huston believes that only people with time in the military are at all qualified to be elected officials--the hero, Lt. Sean &quot;Trey&quot; Woods, E-mails his Congressman, the only man in the House to be a former soldier, that the US should declare war on a single individual and his terrorist organization.	2001-07-13

There's also heavy discussion of the ethics of eugenics, as Bashir rails on about how he's had to hide his own genetic upgrades all his life and Locken saying that eugenics is necessary to prevent the Federation from going in the same direction as Rome.<br /> The subplots that were brought up in AVATAR are continued in here: Kira is finding a little acceptance about her excommunication in the form a Security deputy and Shakaar, who is also questioning her fitness for command of DS9.  Commander Vaughn got to revel in his Fonzie-esque air of cool mystery some more; while this was technically a Bashir-focused book, I really want to see more of Vaughn.  And the verdict on Ezri's transfer to the command track is in: red is definitely not her color.	2001-07-02

Hawk.  It also plays up the lesser-of-two-evils/greater-of-two-goods dilemma of whether or not to support Chiaros' allegedly-genocidal goverment or the rebels who want to overthrow it, and whether or not to hand the entire sector over to the Romulans in exchange for a list of Tal Shiar agents working in the Federation.<br /> As for the oft-debated subplot of making Hawk a gay Irish Martian with a thing for historical holodramas, the writers of FIRST CONTACT left the door open for it by making Hawk a redshirt without so much as a first name, but Mangels and Martin made him come off as a spaceborne Will Truman; another positive example of this would be Slon in NEW FRONTIER #10: EXCALIBUR #2: RENAISSANCE.  He's not the first gay Trek character (that honor goes to the Mirror Universe Ezri) but I was suprised to see that even though the 24th century is so enlightened and tolerant to allow this sort of relationship, they're still using the self-segregationist term &quot;partner&quot; instead of &quot;boyfriend&quot; or &quot;husband.&quot;  They also fell prey to the DS9 running gag of having a homosexual relationship with a Trill, and used the BABYLON 5 subplot of Martians not liking Earth.	2001-07-02

Some of the things mentioned about Hawk's mysterious past require having read several books from the &quot;Wingman&quot; series, like the photo he has on him when he's initially found, and some of the sci-fi stuff that's described sounds like it's from old 1950s Buck Rogers serials, but it ultimately comes off as a shorter, far-future revision of &quot;Wingman #14: The Sky Ghost&quot; in that Hawk is desperately trying to figure out who he really is and where he really comes from while wowing everybody he comes across with his flying skills.  The best part if the description of the Earth Race that featured on the cover, and how Hawk enters it flying what's ultimately an F-16C Fighting Falcon hand-built out of salvaged starship components.	2001-06-05

It doesn't cover all the comics--for example, the story arc &quot;Bread and Circuses,&quot; where Batman reenacts &quot;Diggstown&quot; in Penguin's free-trade zone, is reduced to a couple of sentences in one of Barbara Gordon's assorted journal entries--but what's left over is everything Tim Burton and Michael Keaton made Batman out to be: dark, brooding and heavy on personal vengeance.  The best parts were the ones told from the point of view of Garrett, a not-particularly-bright goon working for the Penguin: he thinks that Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince&quot; is a fairy tale and calls a Louis XV chair a &quot;Louie Cans.&quot;	2001-05-31

However, some of the details about the Greater Boston area really threw it off for me and reinforced Heitman's carpetbagger status, like using &quot;Port Authority&quot; instead of &quot;Massport&quot; like everyone else I know.  Also, her descriptions of Marblehead are completely off-base: it does not look like it was transplanted from Europe, the number of detectives in the Marblehead PD can be counted on one hand, and coffee shops are not called &quot;crumpet shops.&quot;	2001-05-15

It also provided easy-to-digest blues history in addition to the humor (one of the bad guys is a psychotic 19-year-old Elvis wannabe), but the contempt Nick shows for the Blues Shack, a corporate blues nightclub chain, struck me as a thinly-veiled diatribe against the House of Blues, right down to the Shack having Sunday gospel breakfasts.  Even so, it's a great start to what should be a spectacular series.	2001-03-31

Since I've always been a fan of Hawk's from the old &quot;Spenser: For Hire&quot; TV show, I was rather pleased to see that he'd received most of the focus despite the whole Spenser series being told first-person by Spenser.

The dogfight scenes were exciting, although some of the World War One dogfight manuevers like the Vrille and Renversement were lost on someone who's used to the more-modern Immellmann, Split-S, High Yo-Yo and Scissors.

One character is said to have become an ace in Vietnam by shooting down six MiGs in an Intruder--a ground-attack bomber without defensive weapons.  A flashback to DESERT STORM mentions a request for an Alert-5 (able to launch with 5 minutes' notice) Fly-By-Wire (a completely computerized flight control system) strike involving six F-16s (Air Force planes) from the USS CONSTITUTION (a Tall Ship that last saw action in the War of 1812); ....

It consists of little parables and stories and games to illustrate what the Rules were trying to pass on, such as &quot;There is no substitute for success&quot; involving a riot at a public event on Ferenginar because a band called Success never appeared.  To top it off, the DS9 producers made it &quot;official&quot; by mentioning some of the stuff that appears in it in episodes, like Sisko's middle name and a couple of popular Ferengi beverages.	2000-10-22

Reilly just keeps dropping you into firefight after fistfight after knifefight after chase scene after monster attack.  There were, however, some inaccuracies regarding the US military that I chalked up to Reilly being an Australian citizen: for example, the hero, Marine 1LT Shane &quot;Scarecrow&quot; Schofield, is said to have once held the rank of lieutenant commander while being a Marine, and that the USS Wasp is part and parcel of the Marine Corps.

Han also gets a new pal of sorts, Droma the ever-so-amusing Ryn  with eccentric personality traits and insights into the universe in  general.

Unfortunately it isn't; there were a slew of contradictions  between what was presented here and what was deemed &quot;official&quot; by  what was dropped here and there in episodes, and that's why it lost a star.  The book says Harry's Academy roommate was George Mathers, but the episode  &quot;The Cloud&quot; says it was James MacAllister.  Torres' mother's name  is Prabsa here, but was revealed to be Miral in &quot;Barge of the  Dead.&quot;  There's no mention of Paris' desire to join the Federation  Naval Patrol instead of Starfleet as he explained in &quot;Thirty  Days.&quot;  However, it did give some interesting looks into possible  backstories for them, such as Chakotay and Harry having the same officer  shepherd them during their respective plebe summers at Starfleet Academy,  Neelix's drug addiction, Tuvok's original plan to be a priest, and Paris  being in the same Maquis cell as Chakotay and Torres.	2000-08-19

It's like a rollercoaster in terms of how the storyline  proceeds: a lot of alternating rising and falling action, which creates  many a lull.  It should've been streamlined, or split into two separate  books--it basically breaks down to taking Earth back from the Psychlos, and  keeping Earth in the face of a new alien invasion and learning that we have  a week to pay off the horrifically huge mortgage on it.

Instead it read like a distant-future version of World War Three with some  occasional alien weirdness thrown in.	2000-01-11

I can use the cool military acronyms too!\\"<br />That's what this book screamed at me when I read it.  Slater's artistic license should be permanently revoked over this book: the US military is depicted  as being so inept and stupid that they'd surrender to your average Pokemon  armed with a Taco Bell Chalupa.  The cover is misleading; there's no air  combat at all.  To top it off, the miltia freaks are depicted as more  organized than they probably are in real life: gun control is not a big  enough issue to foment a rebellion around, and the whole war would probably  turn into an American version of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.<br /> The only  frightening thing about this scenario is that it spawned sequels.  Anybody  who thinks Slater's better than Tom Clancy should know that Clancy at least  researches his material.	1999-12-17

Shopworn Conventions, and Outdated Archetypes	Books	5	3	6	N	N	A contributor speaks out	It was amusing to learn about assorted hackneyed cliches that I'd kinda noticed in the background of movies.  It was even more fun to contribute some that I had discovered on my own, such as &quot;Backseater Mortality  Phenomenon&quot; and &quot;Inevitable Girl Next Door.&quot;	1999-11-27

I've seen some old Buck Rogers serials that Proton must have been based on, and they were just as  over-the-top and badly written as the Captain Proton stuff that's appeared  from time to time on Voyager.  I also liked the subtle Star Trek in-jokes  that appeared in it: Proton's ship gets thrown across the galaxy so far it  would take 70 years to get home (just like Voyager), and a letter from  Benny Russell, the '50s pulp sci-fi writer Sisko hallucinated he was on  DS9.	1999-10-27

While I also think that Joe Morton's a good actor, his  performance here left something to be desired: he tended to hesitate here  and there with the narration, misportrayed Natalia Nogulich's character of  Admiral Nechayev by giving her a Russian accent and pronouncing her name  &quot;Neck-uh-yev&quot; instead of the correct &quot;Nuh-chay-ev,&quot; and  when performing Robin Lefler, he sounds nothing at all like Ashley Judd,  the actress who originally played her.  I know it sounds like harping, but  I think it's somewhat justified since he manages to pull off sounding like  Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, and Brent Spiner on the tape.	1999-06-05
