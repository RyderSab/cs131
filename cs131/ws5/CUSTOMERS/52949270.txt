He started  speaking to TEC groups to share his experience as a founding owner of a  Company: how he did it, lessons learned along the way, mistakes made,  etc.<br />Gill is a compelling speaker with down-home charm coupled with  pragmatic advice and practical insights.  I don't even hold it against him  that he is from Dallas. His Company, RSI, became one of the most successful  and largest religious fund raising firms in the country. Gill, I believe,  literally founded the fund raising industry.<br />The book is a compilation of  anecdotal stories. Each chapter is a story, followed by his insights,  followed by questions for the reader to consider. The book is engaging,  funny, poignant, touching, gritty, visceral, and philosophical. While it is  almost 300 pages, it is any easy read. I found once I started it, I could  not put it down.<br />The Message<br />While the book offers no theoretical  premise, each chapter builds on an experience to build a \\"plank\\" into  Gill's platform of how to run and grow a successful Company. Each chapter  \\"story\\" can be a \\"stand alone module.\\" In fact, it struck me that you could  read the book of 30+ chapters in random order, without missing any of the  message.<br />The book is waiting for the business gurus to distill Gill's  wisdom into a theoretical premise on the principles of building a great  enterprise.<br />Many of the themes are common to what we have heard in our  Group and from our speakers. A few of these include:<br />1. Absolute  integrity of the leadership: sharing the good and the bad news, admitting  your mistakes, walking your talk. 2. Attracting the best and the  brightest: smart, highly motivated, decisive. Talent is the ultimate  differentiation of company performance, in Gill's assessment. But, the best  and brightest have to be able to work in a cooperative team environment. 3.  The critical role that coaching and mentoring make early in the career of a  person. 4. People who are very successful have a higher calling: it's  more than about money, it's about making a difference. 5. If you are  not a life long learner, then you are dead(and may not know it.)<br />All in  all, this book is well worth reading. In order to get the most from it, it  does require you to spend some time with his questions at the end of each  chapter. Therefore, I recommend that you read it twice: once straight  through as an easy read, and note the chapters of particular significance  for yourself. Then, go back and re-read the short list of highest relevance  chapters for yourself, working the questions posed at the end of  each.<br />For me, personally, the most compelling chapter is Chapter 16,  called \\"Having Enough.\\" The question posed is \\"what do you stand for?\\"(what  do you represent).  I struggled with that question for a long time. About a  decade I evolved to my answer: making a difference every day in people's  lives. How?
