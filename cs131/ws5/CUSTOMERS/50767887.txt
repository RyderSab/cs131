As a review on the back on my copy puts it &quot;this is an excellent portrait of a ghastly man.&quot;<br />Barry Miles does not understate Kerouac's influence. He takes him seriously as a writer and stylist, despite the patchiness of his output. His importance, says Miles, lay in his popularising the break with American post-war conformity (On the Road) and his prophesizing a Zen-infused &quot;world full of rucksack wanderers&quot; (The Dharma Bums), which underpinned the more thoughtful end of hippiedom.<br />No doubt such things would have happened without Kerouac, or any of the beats, but this odd mother-lovin' alcoholic redneck from the small-town north-east undoubtedly flavoured the 60s and 70s and inspired countless thousands of wanderers and artists.<br />Barry Miles's contribution is to sort through the myth, delivering a freshness to a now largely stale story of genius, self-obsession, and fatal loathing. The accounts of the cold-water flats of 1940s New York are especially vivid, where the beat ethos - much rougher than its hippie godchild - was formed.<br />With so much sentimentalising of the Kerouac story, this is one for readers who've been moved by the man but want more than the literary postcard.	2004-01-21

It takes two of the most tricky subjects around, wild romantic love and the Western instinct to &quot;aid&quot; the stricken, and renders them in all their rich contradictions and complexity.<br />By focusing on the short life of Emma McCune, Ms Scroggins gains a narrative structure on which she can hang many coats. She is revealing in her insights into both the nobility and folly of the &quot;aid&quot; industry. She evokes the strained English gentility in which Emma was raised, and the louche milieu of the Nairobi whites where she later became a star, beautiful, passionate and promiscuous. <br />Over each of those options, she preferred life in the swamps and savannahs of southern Sudan - &quot;not a beautiful country,&quot; as she told an interviewer, but a place where the &quot;people are so charming.&quot;<br />Her passion for the velvet-smooth warlord Riek Machar is her triumph and her undoing, and arguably contributes to the needless death of thousands of people.<br />Strung along her narrative, Ms Scroggins writes the most accessible account of the dread realities of Sudan's civil war yet. It is an awful, awesome, compelling place, riven with famine, religious slaughter, slavery, oil, and treachery at every turn. And yet it is not - finally - a pessimistic account.<br />Another reader complained that Scroggins spent too much time recounting her hotel rooms and conversations with taxi drivers. I don't recall a single taxi driver mentioned. The few first-person references all seemed relevant and useful to me.<br />This is so well written, so smoothly accommodating of a love story, frontline journalism, and dark history - and so honest about the confusions that are inevitable in this mix that it should be required reading for anyone drawn to aid work, Africa, or to rampant, improbable love.	2003-12-02

In part it is a travel journal recounting Lindqvist's own slow journey across the Sahara. This is the least developed piece of the narrative, but it gives light relief to the other material. More substantial is Lindqvist's deconstruction of Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; the iconic European novel of Africa. With a light touch, Lindqvist sets Conrad's writings in the context of Europe's developing ideas of Africa in the 1890s, as a glorious playing field, a treasure-house to be looted, a distant extension of the intrigues of the European capitals.<br />At its heart, Lindqvist's extended essay is a history of Europe's colonial instinct for genocide. He argues that Hitler's Holocaust was not an aberration in European history, but rather a logical extension of the policies used by the British in Sudan, the Belgians in the Congo, the French in Mali, and so on. Hitler's only difference was that he sought colonial expansion within the boundaries of Europe (a crime against humanity), rather than overseas (the spread of civilisation). <br />Lindqvist charts how European imperialists seized on the emerging theories of Charles Darwin to justify genocide on pseudo-scientific grounds. And also how Germany, not initially among the imperialists, spawned the most articulate opponents of colonialism. Later, when Bismarck set out to get an empire of Germany's own, funded by Germany's rising industrial might, the prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany became increasingly racist - setting the ground for Hitler.<br />People argue that since Lindqvist published this book, monstrous slaughters in Cambodia and Rwanda have destroyed his thesis. Not so. It is not hard to argue that both Cambodia and Rwanda's genocides were a reaction, at least in part, to European or American policies. Even if you choose not to accept that argument, there can be no denying that Lindqvist's fundamental thesis remains. Europeans in Africa (and elsewhere, including Australia) brought with them the civilisation of racism and the gun. All else is unimportant.	2001-06-07

Middle class, 30-ish, bright and pretty, Alice locks eyes with a devilishly handsome stranger on a wintry London street and within a few pages has abandoned her safe existence in the grip of a sexual obsession. Doesn't hurt that he's a legitimate mountaineering hero, or that his bedroom technique takes her to places where she's never been.<br />We see the pitfalls long before Alice seems able to, but the story still comes at us dense with dread.

Malinche, to use one of her many names, was the translator and go-between in perhaps the pivotal cultural drama of the last millennium - the moment when the Old World represented by Hernan Cortes, conquered the New World in the form of Montezuma's Mexico.<br />Anna Lanyon, an Australian backpacker, stumbled onto the story of Malinche while travelling in Mexico in the 1970s. Intrigued, she returned home, studied Spanish and Portugese to literary translation level, and revisited Mexico in search of this enigmatic woman.<br />So few are the clues, and often so contradictory, that Lanyon  works like an archeologist with a soft-haired brush to bring Malinche's life into relief from its bedrock of myth.<br />In official Mexican history, Malinche is the &quot;betrayer&quot;. Her name forms the root of a modern-day word for traitor. Lanyon finds a teenager blessed with intelligence, intuition and a sharp instinct for survival. Her options were few. Given as a sexual slave to the conquistadors, Malinche became Cortes's concubine, adviser, and mother of his first child. She died in obscurity, probably before she was 30.<br />But those close to her admired her. Lanyon makes the point often forgotten in facile renderings of the conquest: to vast numbers of people in what now is Mexico, Montezuma's &quot;Aztecs&quot; (more accurately, the Culua-Mexicans) were the feared and hated enemy. Malinche was therefore not a betrayer so much as a warrior, within her own context. But even more than that, she was a woman, condemned to slavery as a child, &quot;assigned&quot; to alien men when not yet 20, who simply did the best she could. <br />While the full personality of Malinche may be irretrievable from what history has left us, Lanyon does great work in debunking many of the myths about her and in exploring how national myths come about. And tantalisingly an impression emerges of thisaccidental figure of history: a woman we would like to have known, a woman from the lowest rungs who took a hand, for better or worse, in changing the world.	2000-12-28

He has no visa, no valid passport, an unreliable map, and a few sentences of Bahasa Indonesian.<br />He can survive in the rainforest only as long as he maintains the trust of the people he meets, as guides, tutors, friends. He does far more than survive, and it is clear from the modesty, resilience and humor that comes through in his writing, that he was made for just this journey.<br />For months on end he immerses himself in a world of exquisite natural richness, among a people who are white-skinned in the permanent shade of the forest canopy, who have no tradition of stories of the moon or stars because they are almost never seen.<br />For weeks at a time he and his hunter guides are - in a Western sense - utterly &quot;lost&quot;, moving apparently aimlessly through trackless bush. When Hansen asks one of his companions how they will find their way to their destination, the Penan hunter says simply: &quot;We will follow our feelings.&quot; Without ever labouring it, Hansen has written a travel book that is deeply satisfying to the spirit, full of wonder and rich in humor. He also captures the moment at which an ancient, closed culture hears the first troubling thunder of global economics. <br />When finally he reaches the coast, Hansen is so depressed by &quot;civilisation&quot; that he does the sane thing - slipping back into the jungle to retrace his steps, all the way back to Sarawak.<br />So truly does he tell his story, I find myself missing him - wondering what he got up to when he finally returned to the US, what travels he might have done since.   As I was finishing this book, I saw a travel brochure extolling Kuching, the Sarawak trading town that was Hansen's first step-off point. The glossy explained how easy it was nowadays to travel inland, with the interior &quot;opened up by good logging roads&quot;.<br />Eric Hansen, lead the weeping.	2000-12-27

Washed ashore on the Florida coast he survives for years until finally linking up with conquistadors in Mexico. During this time, enduring terrible hardships, he gains unique insights and an appreciation of the lives of the people he has fallen among.<br />Perhaps even more extraordinary, however, is the tale of Malinche. A teenaged girl, delivered into slavery by her mother, Malinche was later offered to the Conquistador Cortes as a peace offering on the Gulf of Mexico Coast. She was, in the words of the Spanish padre/historian Bernal Diaz, who knew her well, a woman &quot;of great being&quot;. She became Cortes's concubine/lover, the mother of his son, and - from history's perspective, her most important role - Cortes's translator. She knew both Cortes and Montezuma, the Aztec king. Long's working of her story is no doubt fanciful; little is known of the real Malinche and no records have been found of what she actually thought. But it's a lovely ambition, to make her breathe, this woman who was the very hinge of history, and who lives in Mexican folk stories to this day.<br />Anyone interested in further pursuing the life of Malinche would do well to seek out Anna Lanyon's elegaic new book &quot;Malinche's Conquest&quot;.  Lanyon became so fascinated by the story of Malinche when she was travelling in Mexico in the 1970s, that she studied Portugese and Spanish to literary translation level, and physically set off to track down every possible clue to the woman seen variously as the &quot;traitor&quot; of Mexico, and it's primordial &quot;mother&quot;. The result is a (prize-winning) book of wonder and charm.	2000-11-28

Sudan is an appalling offender through its sponsorship of slave-raiding militias that attack the black, Christian South.<br />But it is Sam Cotton's very emotiveness - understandable as it might be - that weakens his argument. He is guilty of extreme sloppiness. At one point he accuses the US Ambassador to Mauritania, among others, of having their silence &quot;bought&quot; by &quot;plenty of envelopes passing under the table&quot; from the Islamic government. This is a scandalous charge, which if proven would have the Ambassador doing time in jail, but Cotton offers no evidence whatsoever to support it. It is purely an expression of his frustration.<br />And while he resolutely stands by his evidence that Arabs still persist with chattel slavery in Mauritania, he quickly dismisses evidence that black Africans also keep black African slaves. &quot;It is a thing of the past...a charge that does not stand up to inspection,&quot; he insists, refusing to apply the same tests (are they paid? are their children educated?) that he applies to the &quot;slaves&quot; of Arabs.<br />On the material Cotton (and others before him) have gathered, Mauritania certainly has a case to answer that slavery still exists. Furthermore, it should be required to answer it, and the world should not tolerate any fudging.<br />Cotton has added something to the fund of knowledge, and deserves acknowledgment for that. But his writing is too cliche-ridden, too unexamined, too hasty in seeing what it wants to see. And Cotton, inexperienced in African conditions, also overlooks another reality of life on that continent. People do what they must to survive. Millions work in terrible conditions for no cash return. Millions of their children go without food, let alone education. I little doubt slavery exists in Mauritania.

Both were written immediately after WW2, when Englishmen, exhausted, quite reasonably gazed back at a lost time of grace and innocence.<br />Both Hartley and Waugh saw the falseness of that innocence, but also its deeper truth.<br />Hartley's story is worth reading now, at the beginning of this  century, for he places it at the dawn of the last one. Leo, his protagonist, is 12 years old. He has huge dreams for the century that is breaking on him. His faith contrasts with the bitter weariness of his older self, the alternative narrator, who in 1950 lays out this story from his memory, prompted by the discovery of a childhood diary.<br />&quot;Has the 20th Century done so much better than I have?&quot; the narrator chides the memory of his childhood self. &quot;You were vanquished, and so was your century, your precious century that you hoped so much of.&quot;<br />1900 was the last hot summer of Victoria's England. Leo, the only child of a widowed mother, goes to stay with a much wealthier schoolfriend. He sees nothing but the glories of the Maudsley family and their special guest, the Boer war-scarred young nobleman Viscount Trimingham. He becomes enraptured in his friend's sister, the ethereal Marian, for whom he would happily die.<br />In an emotional sense, he will.<br />Marian is kind to Leo. She also uses him. How much her affection was false, how much was genuine, lies at the core of Leo's agony. <br />The boy acts as a go-between in Marian's illicit love for a tenant farmer, a man of physical force, a creation worthy of DH Lawrence. Leo learns that adults are not what they seem. And he takes it hard.<br />It is possible to quibble with this story. It stretches credulity that even a century ago, a boy on the brink of puberty could be quite so naive - or that the loss of innocence should bring so complete an emotional collapse. The young Leo seems too vulnerable, the older one, too stifled. What holds it, though, is the beauty of the writing, the evocation of a lost age - both the age of boyhood and the age when Class, with its immutable threads, bound every English soul to its own orbit. Two world wars, for better or worse, blew such certainties apart.<br />The story lives up to the mystery and the promise of its rightly famous opening line, the haunting and teasing truth: &quot;The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.&quot;	2000-11-28

In subject matter it is a blending of two Patrick White novels - &quot;Voss&quot; about a doomed journey to the (Australian) interior, and &quot;A Fringe of Leaves&quot; about a white woman's life among Aborigines after a 19th Century shipwreck.<br />In Brink's hands, in 1750, a naive but spirited white woman from the Cape accompanies her Swedish explorer husband into the upmapped interior, only to find herself alone when the husband dies and the Hottentot retainers head for the hills.<br />She is found by a runaway slave, Adam, who for reasons of his own agrees to set off with her to the Cape.<br />Brink vividly describes the country through which they must travel. Against its physical presence, the couple become lovers. All of this is good fun. Brink was writing at a time when black/white relationships were forbidden under apartheid law. Indeed, the book for a while was banned. He delivers us a vintage love story, full of sex and spirit. (Funny how Coetzee, 25 years later when inter-racial sex is no longer verboten, sees the politics of such relationships in an entirely different way).<br />As Brink signals in the opening pages, however, there is no happy-ever-after. If there had been (the story purports to be based on truth), South Africa's history might have been different.<br />At times, the writing has less to do with black and white than purple, especially as Brink creates a seaside idyll for his pair, but for my money it's a grand read. It recalls a time when white South African liberals believed if only people could see their true nature everything would be all right.<br />Coetzee's darker - and more recent - version is that WHEN people are most true to their nature, South Africans have much to fear.	2000-11-06

It hints at Phillip Gourevitch's reflection that &quot;power comes when you convince your enemy to inhabit YOUR version of HIS story&quot;.<br />That struggle, each wanting the &quot;correct&quot; version of history to stand, lies at the heart of all Balkan conflicts of the last ten years.<br />Through innumerable interviews with the ordinary people of Kosovo, Serbian and Albanian, Julie Mertus reveals how competing myths came to be, and how they then contributed to an environment where terrorism and atrocity became - ultimately - a logical choice.<br />She does not go back to the mythology surrounding the 1389 defeat of the Serbian Prince Lazar at Kosovo Polje - the rallying point for Milosevic. (Covered already in Noel Malcolm's &quot;Kosovo: A Short History). Mertus shows how events within our generation created defining national stories.<br />Two quick examples.<br />In 1990, thousands of schoolchildren fell ill. The ethnic Albanian understanding: they were deliberately poisoned, probably with Sarin gas, by Serbian authorities. It was proof of the evil Serbs would be willing to do to Albanians. The UCK (Kosovo Liberation Army) recruited youths with the argument that without resistance, they would all be poisoned again.<br />The Serb response to the same event was that it was mass hysteria at best, or at worst a deliberate plot by ethnic Albanians to generate international sympathy against them, the Serbs. It proved the extent of the Kosovars' untrustworthiness, their deviousness. <br />There could be no common ground between those views. Which story you believed, defined you.<br />Similarly, there is the case of Djordje Martinovic, a Serbian peasant whoturned up at hospital with a bottle in his rectum and a story about being assaulted in his field by &quot;masked men&quot;. Although later apparently recanting his story, and confessing his &quot;assault&quot; had been a botched act of self-gratification, for Serbs it became a rallying point. Dismissing the recantation as an Albanian plot, Serbs were only too happy to believe that this, the violation of an honest peasant in an act with echoes of the old Turkish practice of impaling, was the extent to which ethnic Albanians would not hesitate to stoop. Martinovic quickly returned to his original story. He remains on the list of Serb martyrs to this day.<br />Today, Kosovo remains in an effective state of partition, nearly all its former Serb population living above the divided city of Mitrovica. Without the presence of KFOR troops, armed conflict would be inevitable. It is not their religion, or even their language, that divides Serb from Kosovar. It is the incompatability of the stories they tell. Since this book was written, both sides have volumes of fresh grievances, accentuating their enemy's inhumanity and highlighting their own victimhood. These stories, nearly all with some grain of truth, are now being woven themselves into the complex fabric of national myth.<br />Brilliantly, painstakingly and without taking sides, Prof. Mertus has given us a vivid account of how events become remembered. She gives us the template to understand better all the intractable conflicts of our times.	2000-10-27

Professor Lurie (lurid? leery?) has power over his student lover. He argues she, the embodiment of Eros, has power over him. The University exercises its power to sack him; the media, the power to hound him. At his trial he invokes - or tries to - the powerful right of silence. Socially, he accepts his disgrace. He almost wills it. That, too, though self-destructive, is a display of power.<br />But there are other powerful forces in post-apartheid South Africa that exempt neither the self-destructive - nor the idealistic. Taking sanctuary in the country with his lesbian, hippie daughter, they both get a shocking education in what it means to be vulnerable, to be without power of any kind. <br />Greatly reduced, David Lurie's redemptive outlet, finally, is to comfort unwanted dogs as they take the fatal needle. But Coetzee is far too disdainful of novelistic convention to make even this a matter of comfort to us. What if this work, wonders the fallen professor, is itself nothing more than an exercise in power?<br />Coetzee's achievement, I think, comes to two things. He is ruthless in extinguishing easy answers. He also, as a writer, has an unparalleled capacity to compress complex issues into a narrative, without slowing the flow.<br />He has created a book which is painful and challenging at every turn and yet utterly compelling to read.	2000-10-26

But it IS appealling, a character study of delicacy and truth, so full of recognition that the pages turn themselves. Maxwell understands  silences, the things unsaid in an evening of chatter, the state of armed truce that is the architecture of a respectable life, better than almost anyone. Eudora Welty calls it his &quot;integrity&quot;. It is a good word.<br />In the suffocating provincialism of 1912 mid-western America, town lawyer Austin King is undone through his own decency. Through his patience, his sense of propriety, his unwillingness to recognise the grasping motives of others, he unwittingly betrays his family and all but destroys himself.<br />People in the landscape of Draperville, Illinois, dream of escape, have visions of what might now be called &quot;authentic lives&quot;. But the centripetal pull of respectability, the complex web of family duty, entraps them all. The most ardent dreamer is young Nora Potter, whose infatuation with Austin King gives this story its fever and throws all other relationships into relief.<br />The characters are beautifully drawn. Nora's obsession, which she sees as liberating, wreaks instead its inevitable destruction.  Austin King, faithful to the belief that  steadfast, if unimaginative goodness, will be rewarded in kind, is both noble and tragic. The minor characters are equally real. The interior world of the King's four year old daughter Abbey is the most convincing evocation of early childhood I have ever read.<br />In many ways, though, the story is Martha's. Austin's role-bound wife, pregnant with their second child, hears the town's talk, yet copes better with Austin's apparent affair, than she could with his seamless virtue. The final page is hers, a denouement of such chilling and tender clarity it reminds me of the interior monologue that closes James Joyce's &quot;The Dead&quot;.<br />Whatever Maxwell seems to claim, this IS a book about love, and about its many shapes. Perhaps his truest opinion he entrusts to a minor character, the horse trader Danforth, deaf from an early age, who has long abandoned all thought of human intimacy. With no expectation of it, love comes anyway. It abides, and is beautiful.<br />So is this book.	2000-10-23

Nor is he here.<br />The book is a game, a riddle. The fictional form is simply a device. An ageing Australian author goes to visit her son at an American university. Her purpose is to give a speech and to attend a dinner. She chooses to explore the lives of animals.<br />Coetzee's aim is not, apparently, to make friends, to espouse any particular point of view, or to convince anybody of anything. But he needles. And he teases. There is not a page in this slim and brilliantly efficient book that doesn't include some idea, or a challenge to received ideas, to confront us and to invite us to think more deeply.<br />That is his achievement.<br />At the end, any comfortable ideology we took into the book has been exposed. I defy anyone to read it and not to think in a new way about the processes of reason, the homo-centric nature of man, and - more than anything - about the lives of animals, whose place on this planet has never been so tenuous.	2000-10-01

The town on the  bend in the river is never identified, neither is the country, nor the  &quot;Big Man&quot; who looms unseen over everything. But we can take it to  be Kisangani in Zaire in the early days of Mobutu.<br />The town stands were  the Arabs of the Indian Ocean coast met the European colonialists heading  inland from the Atlantic. It is a place where everyone is from somewhere  else, except for the local Africans. They have less power than anyone, but  run to rhythms and fears that threaten always to overwhelm them  all.<br />Salim gets drawn into what appears to be a new intellectual life in  the town when the Big Man establishes a centre for elites and Salim begins  an affair with the beautiful young wife of a European academic. The liaison  is written with piercing psychological clarity but seems - in the text -  emotionally stifled. This is a product of Naipaul's writing. He lacks  passion in the love scenes, but that same reserve perfectly suits him for  the rest of the tale.<br />It is the lack of sentiment that makes this book so  terrifying. Things happen to his characters. It is neither here nor there;  it is just the way of things. Africa cares nothing for their conceits.  Ultimately it cares nothing for the conceits of any man or any woman - the  Big Man included. It is utterly damning of outsiders who see this great and  terrible continent as a &quot;project.&quot;<br />The Oxford Companion to 20th  Century Literature talks of Naipaul's sense of despair. That is as may be.  But Zaire/Congo's history since this book was published is more horrifying  than even Naipaul's vision, although he hints at it at the end.<br />The New  York-based International Rescue Committee recently reported that 1.7  million people had died as a consequence of war and instability in Eastern  Congo in the last five years. &quot;A Bend In The River&quot; is like a  message in a bottle, carrying the last cryptic news before the darkness  came down.	2000-08-25

There are, in this book, some  deeply disturbing survivor's accounts of the genocide, transcribed,  unvarnished, from their own testimony. It is all the more powerful for the  directness of its expression.<br />Most valuable to me was the material  explaining the colonial origins of the division between Tutsis and Hutus.  It is extraordinary to me that when Rwanda and Burundi were  &quot;assigned&quot; to Germany in the 1880s, no European had even set foot  in those lands. When they came, their pursuit of control caused divisions  where previously - on this evidence - none had existed. Blame for the  genocide must be seated in the Belgian colonial rulers in general (they  took over after 1916), and the missionary churches in particular. This book  explains why.<br />Rwanda, more than any other event since WW2, makes us  consider the question put eloquently here by one of the witnesses: what is  humanity? Who is included? Who is left out? For the world not to have acted  effectively to have prevented the Rwandan cataclysm stands to its shame.  Kofi Annan has admitted as much, but the real fault lies with everyone and  we should all be ashamed.<br />The compilers of this book have acted bravely  in including an apologia from the authors of the genocide. We hear their  voices. We must be sickened by them. We must acknowledge that we were  warned; the voices existed long before the worst of the genocide began.  <br />Knowing what we know about the world, would we prevent it next time? Be  honest now; would we?	2000-08-25

I picked up this  book out of curiosity but without much in the way of expectations.<br />Having  read it, I am stunned and in awe. <br />There are many more famous and exalted  names in foreign journalism than Scott Peterson's - at least until now. The  sheer passion of his reporting, the level of his commitment, his  fearlessness both when faced by African violence and the equally grotesque  rationalisations of those who clumsily intervene (and those who fail to  intervene)deserve him a place in the highest rankings.<br />He stuck with  Somalia when most of the rest of the world lost interest (I plead guilty).  He took trouble to understand the Somali perspective when most others saw  it as an American story. He writes illuminatingly about Sudan - perhaps the  world's most overlooked war zone, rich in terrible, hopeless, wasteful  loss. His writings on Rwanda add renewed freshness to the gut-churning  horrors of the genocide - after Gourevitch's &quot;We Wish To Inform You  That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families&quot; apparently left  little more to be said.<br />Peterson returns the degraded craft of journalism  to its purest form: he &quot;bears witness.&quot; He risks his life to do  so. He loses friends. He confesses his fear. He disdains received wisdom.  He redeems the lazy journalism of the pampered hacks with one eye on the  room service menu and the other on how well their &quot;heroism&quot; will  play back home.<br />Anyone with an interest in Africa, reporting, the nature  of the human condition, the politics of humanitarian intervention, or just  a damn good, disturbing read about the ways of the world would do well to  read this book.	2000-08-25

Out of this gestation there has recently arrived a flood of books. Geoffrey Robertson's  &quot;Crimes Against Humanity&quot; details the development of the legal  arguments for humanitarian intervention; Susan Moeller's &quot;Compassion  Fatigue&quot; explains its political limits in terms of domestic apathy  (blaming, rather too heavily I think, the media); Michael Ignatieff has  written compellingly on humanitarian intervention from the perspective of a  muscular-minded moral philosopher.. but Shawcross - more than anyone in my  view - &quot;tells it like it is.&quot;<br />Shawcross says his is a story of  hope. It is hard to see how. With commendable clarity he charts the history  of humanitarian-inspired interventions, focussing on the post Cold War  world, when the end of superpower rivalries seemed briefly to make all  things possible.<br />Encouraged by the apparent (though only partial) success  of UNTAC in Cambodia, the &quot;international community&quot; (please God,  let us find another phrase!) rushed naively and disastrously into Somalia  (for more on this I recommend Scott Peterson's lively new memoir &quot;Me  Against My Brother&quot;). The world powers then turned to water when  confronted by the terrible challenge of Rwandan genocide. Shawcross writes  powerfully of this, as Gourevitch among others have done. He also writes  with chilling force of the events leading to the fall of Srebrenica, and  the global pusillanimity that allowed Foday Sankoh his free and terrible  reign in Sierra Leone.<br />As the century turns there are slim victories for  those who believe the &quot;good guys&quot; of the outside world can bring  peace to the blighted. The Australian-led INTERFET force in East Timor  secured a shattered territory to give some hope of genuine transition to  peaceful democracy. Mozambique, too, has been a quiet success story, making  the recent devastating floods all the more tragic.<br />But the lessons of  Shawcross's dispassionate analysis are those that the political powers  least want to hear. If the US, France and other Western powers want to live  up to the fine sound of their humanitarian rhetoric, they must stop playing  their policies to their domestic audiences. If they want to approve  impressive-sounding mandates, they must be willing to back them with men  and material. They must be willing to risk the lives of their soldiers.  They must look upon their cowardice in Srebrenica and Rwanda with shame  (and I don't speak of the individual Dutch and Belgian soldiers who,  respectively, were there). They must be more ready to see in Kofi Annan  perhaps the last best hope the UN has.<br />If they are not willing to do  those things, Shawcross makes clear, they might as well admit that  humanitarian intervention is an emperor without clothes, and that the worst  suffering in the world is irremediable.	2000-06-14

The point, surely, is not whether Emma Bovary is a good woman, or a bad mother, as some reviewers seem to think. What we get is a woman who is entirely  human. Her ultimately fatal desires are believable, her weaknesses as  common today as they ever were.<br />A post-modern Emma Bovary would divorce,  take the kid, and juggle childcare with a career in casting or magazine  journalism. Flaubert's heroine had no such options. Her dreams manifested  themselves in the futile search for a transforming love - a goal as  seductive today as ever.<br />Just as Cervantes wrote &quot;Don Quixote&quot;  in part as satire on the literary tastes of the day, Flaubert takes aim at  the unrealistic romance novels of his time. His antidote is a story of such  realism we recognise every character and every human foible. The sexual  descriptions, while not explicit in a modern sense, are still remarkably  frank, their power transparent.<br />The author most similar, in my view, is  Flaubert's English contemporary Thomas Hardy. I am a huge fan of Hardy, but  none of his heroes, not Jude nor the Mayor of Casterbridge nor even  Tess  comes to us as intimately as the beautiful, ardent, bored and ultimately  wasted Emma B.	2000-03-15

The climate is an apt metaphor for the cool emotional tone of the protagonist, Fabian  Vas.<br />The plot unfolds like an idiot plodding. As much colour is invested  in the description of place as it is in the lurid circumstances of the  story - not a great deal.<br />And yet I reckon it works. The lonely boy who  has a feel for the fine detail of feathers on a wing, but cannot see love  when it stands before his eyes, was convincing to me. The story is his  confession. There's no sentimentality. The language is restrained. It fits  the buttoned down nature of Witless Bay where formal courtesies struggle to  cope with the untidy passions that lie at the heart of the  tale.<br />Relentless, remorseless, restrained...the book makes no appeal to  our emotions, but stirs them just the same. Highly recommended for a  weekend when the fire is glowing and the weather closing in.	2000-03-15

As part of  my job, I read as many of them as I can. It is this book, however, that I  constantly return to. My copy is dog-eared, and deeply scored with  underlinings. In every paragraph, Ignatieff has something worthwhile - and  frequently confronting - to say.  <br />He addresses the role of the media and  the triangle of relationships between audience/media/political leaders; he  looks at the rise in humanitarian organisations and the peculiarities of  the ethics under which they work; he brings insights from the field on the  way the UN is so often programmed to fail.<br />The power of Ignatieff's  writing stems from his  unique capacity to bring together the perspectives  of news correspondent, novelist and  philosopher. He is direct and  extremely readable, while also knifing into the subtle heart of the  &quot;New World Order.&quot;<br />In the chapter entitled &quot;The Narcissism  of Minor Difference&quot; he comes as close anything I have read to  explaining why ordinary people are moved sometimes to conduct atrocities on  their neighbours. It is vivid and convincing.<br />If you feel exasperated by  the hideous mysteries of ethnic and sectarian conflict, I urge you to read  this book, if for that chapter alone.	2000-03-09

Simon Winchester takes a stab at the books of &quot;terrible dullness and labyrinthine sobriety&quot; that make up most that get written about the  Balkans. <br />Instead he takes us on a romp. His journey from Vienna to  Istanbul spans the period of NATO's bombardment over Kosovo last year. He  snatches at images and characters along the way. He is good at it. He has  an eye for eccentrics and characters and the contradictions that constantly  spring out the tortured landscape around him. It is a good read. His trip  into Pristina ahead of the KFOR troops is vivid stuff, though he leaves too  soon to continue his journey east. He is more generous to the Serbs than  most daily news reports, simply because he acknowledges a wider and longer  context.<br />His attempt to explain WHY the Serbs responded with such (at  times) unspeakable violence in Kosovo is clumsy and ill thought out. But  this is not intended to be serious history, or even serious journalism. It  is, for the most part, lively and engaging - a touch rushed - but also  clear-sighted about a place mired in the history of wars and the  consequences of wars.<br />The saddest man was the Sarajevo newspaper editor  who put out his publication under fire throughout the city's long seige,  who is so depressed by the corruption now thriving in the peace, that he is  nostalgic for the days of war.  If that's the legacy, what hope is there?	2000-03-02

Rather too obviously based on  the life of famed  war cameraman Neil Davis, it follows its hero from  sylvan days in the hopfields of Tasmania to the warzones of Vietnam and  Cambodia. The evocations of scented Asia, the journo/GI milieu, the chaos  of battle are extremely strong.<br />Over time the hero's naive idealism is  forged into - um, experienced idealism, as he comes to identify with the  Cambodian people in particular. His ultimate fate is almost operatic in its  awfulness. <br />The French have a word - sillage - which means the  ineffable  scent left in the air by a woman's passing. This book leaves a sillage. It  is the gentle wash of sadness of the old survivors of those horrible  South-East Asian wars, as they calculate the prices paid, and wonder at  their meaning.<br />I recommend this book. It is like an old-fashioned Sunday  roast - not necessarily the meal you'd choose, but richly satisfying at the  end.	2000-02-21

The strength for me of this book is that for once the sea isn't disguised as a person with human-like &quot;emotions.&quot; This is not &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. Junger sets his story in the impacable worlds of physics  and economics. Want to know HOW the sea can rise to heights no vessel can  endure? Junger will tell you. Want to know WHY men and women risk the  graveyard shoals of the Grand Banks - Junger will explain the economics of  fish. It gives an inexorable inevitability to the tragedy that  follows.<br />Junger has been described as writing like &quot;a poet who went  to meteorology school.&quot; He is not a poet. His style, for the most  part, is workmanlike. But he tells his tale without undue dramatics,  letting the events speak for themselves - while the main character, the  sea, sits massively at the outer limit of our human comprehension.<br />Start  this book and it is like running downhill at the edge of control; you know  the ending is not going to be pretty, but it isn't that easy to stop.	2000-02-11

For me, it was simple curiosity. New Zealand, where I'd come from, had imperfect race relations,  but Maori dances, hakas, and creation stories were taught from primary  level at every school. Like many &quot;Pakeha&quot; (white) New Zealanders,  I had a part-Maori partner - whom I later married. In Perth, however,  no-one I spoke to, including white journalists with whom I worked, could  tell me what the &quot;Dreamtime&quot; spoken about in aboriginal culture  meant. Their demeanour suggested the very questions displayed a lack of  taste.<br />     Strange then, that it should have been a Briton who gave me  my first insights - to have the boldness both to outline and celebrate the  unique richness of Aboriginal cosmology, and to put it in the context of  the great nomadic traditions of human life. This is beautifully written,  wry and teasing; it respects aboriginality, but shows a lightness of touch  rare in this particularly fraught field. <br />     Arguments have been made  against this book on anthropological grounds, and on the grounds that no  non-aboriginal person should presume to write about such matters. There may  be merit in  these points of view; I am simply grateful that Chatwin turned  his brilliance to this subject. I find this book as illuminating and as  life-affirming now, as when I first read it many years ago.<br />     Other  books I can recommend, although more prosaic in style, are Geoffrey  Blainey's &quot;The Triumph of the Nomads&quot;, Henry Reynolds'  &quot;Frontier&quot; and &quot;Why Weren't We Told&quot; and the official  reports into the so-called &quot;Stolen Generation&quot; and the Royal  Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. <br />There is still a way to  go.	2000-02-10

In WW2, Churchill equally admired Fitzroy MacLean, another well-born Brit who tied his fortunes to a foreign guerrilla warfare operation. But where Lawrence was doomed and dark and  full of his own agonies, MacLean carries his charm and wit (and what  Australians would call &quot;a larrikin streak&quot;) throughout his  extraordinary adventures.     If MacLean had not existed he would have had  to be invented. We meet him as a 20-something diplomat, subverting Stalin's  spies in a series of solo explorations into the forbidden zones of Central  Asia. He also observes, and astutely analyses, the infamous Soviet  show-trial in which Bukharin and other heroes of the 1917 revolution met  their fate.     When war breaks out, he contrives to escape the diplomatic  service, signing on as a lowly private. He ends the war as a general, his  breast weighed down with medals from Britain, Yugoslavia, and even the  Soviet Union. He is 34.      This is the story of those days - racy, funny,  bizarre, and full of daring. His adventures with the legendary SAS  commando, engaged in lightning strikes deep in Rommel's rear in the North  Africa desert are gripping stuff. Selected by Churchill himself to  parachute into the Balkans, MacLean takes a frontline role with Tito in  arranging the ultimate defeat of German forces there. Essential background  reading for anyone remotely interested in the Balkan tragedies of the last  decade or so.    Soldier, diplomat, linguist, wit, Fitzroy MacLean was  reputedly the inspiration for the original James Bond. Undoubtedly a  beneficiary of the British class system, he was also an ornament to it. 50  years after its first publication, this remains a unique window to some of  the most extraordinary upheavals of the 20th century.	2000-01-28

As a central device, the parallel journey into the heart of Africa and the dark centre of the human experience, remains as powerful as ever. The writing in the opening pages, depicting the men and the Thames  and the wide possibilities that rise with every outgoing tide, remain as  evocative as anything in English. Conrad's subject is barbarity, a theme as  relevant now as then. His dark view of the colonial instinct also stands as  a warning at this very hour. With &quot;Lord Jim&quot; a thicker, but in  many ways easier book to read, Conrad poses the great existential question  that was to dominate personal politics throughout the 20th Century, the  taking of personal responsibility, the search for personal redemption - as  one character puts it: &quot;How to be - Ach! How to be?&quot; With  &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; he articulates what Michael Ignatieff has  described as &quot;the seductiveness of moral disgust.&quot; Faced with the  darkness around him, the character Kurtz advises &quot;exterminate the  brutes.&quot; His final, dread epiphany, his message from the heart of his  own darkness &quot;The Horror! The Horror!&quot; is as chilling now as it  was a century ago - a century that has seen more horror than even Conrad  could have imagined.	2000-01-28
US	50767887	RHA7V9H8JKWZW	0393047431	275234414	The Haiku Anthology	Books	4	28	30	N	N	A gathering of silences	The point is often made that haiku is an increasingly popular poetic form in English, although the truth is probably more that Americans, among English speakers, have for some reason particularly taken to this classical Japanese discipline.  Almost without exception, the 89 writers featured in  this anthology are from the USA or Canada, losing it a star - in my  estimation - for lack of global range. That said, this book contains many  delights. There is a clear and useful introduction explaining the technical  differences between classical haiku forms (with their zen-like focus on  nature, seaons, and a permanent present tense) and &quot;senryu&quot;,  which concentrate on human relationships and the distinctly human  condition. An anthology survives on its works, however, and there is much  here to intrigue. The late Nicholas Virgilio's best known work is included  here, full of classical Japanese haiku spirit.<br />            lily:/              out of the water../             out of itself<br />Some of the senyru owe  as much to Homer Simpson as Basho or Buson. Try Alan Pizzarelli's<br />             the fat lady/             bends over the tomatoes/             a full  moon<br />Many deal with unequivocally modern subjects. For example, Alexis  Rotella's <br />            Discussing divorce/             he strokes/              the lace tablecloth<br />For a non-American, many of the works here seem  too self-absorbed - the very opposite of haiku's original intention. There  are also too many works that are meretricious, that seem dashed off, as if  their slight size makes haiku light weight. But in 850 works, there are  plenty that achieve the elusive gift of transferring epiphany. This  pleasingly bound little hardback should inspire writers, poets, readers. It  will also, hopefully, direct the curious back to the great works of the  Japanese Masters, Basho, Buson and Issa, in particular. Mostly though, it  is a book to nag at us gently, infuriate us occasionally, as slowly its  little gems work their way into our thoughts.<br />               my dead  brother../                hearing his laugh/                in my  laughter<br />(N.

With apartheid such a huge and pervasive structure, he  finds his greatest insights in the intimate detail of routine events. As a  crime reporter for a Johannesburg newspaper he does the unthinkable,  setting out to investigate the individual circumstances in Soweto's myriad  daily murders. The closer he looks, the more the reality of a racist and  violent system is thrown into relief. He turns up some astonishing stories  - the tale of the &quot;Hammerman&quot; is absolutely compelling journalism  - but he also reveals, as Michael Ignatieff has done, how faultlines can  open up to murderous degrees from the very simplest failures of  understanding.  All the cosy assumptions, the fables that comfort in turn  the arch-conservatives, the liberals, the youthful rebels, the black  freedom fighters - and Malan himself - are shown to be suspect. As his  sensibilities sharpen, Malan develops a deep pessimism about the country  which for all its violent complexities, he cannot help but love. It should  be said the substance of this book was written before Nelson Mandela's  release, and it was published three years before South Africans finally  voted for a government of their choice. Malan himself has conceded the  future may not be as bleak as he foresaw. It doesn't matter. The lasting  value of this book is in its description of a search for truth. The  humility he brings to the process provides its own lesson. South Africa has  been blessed with some of the towering figures of the late 20th century.  But even with their leadership, there are few easy answers, and this book  goes a long way to explaining why.	2000-01-21
US	50767887	R3DMSPY2JZP02E	0312243359	601276911	We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda	Books	5	398	407	N	N	A required text for the 21st century	In early May 1994 I stood on a bridge over the river that forms the border between Rwanda and Tanzania and observed corpses floating down towards Lake Victoria in an unbroken stream. As I write this, two Rwandan women are  taking the unprecedented action of suing the United Nations for its failure  to intervene in the worst act of genocide since WW2. UN secretary-general  Kofi Annan, who played a kay role in UN decision-making in 1994, has  confessed the UN's &quot;failure&quot; and expressed his own &quot;deep  remorse.&quot;  800,000 people died, most of them hacked to death with  machetes by their neighbours. How this happened, and how the world utterly  failed in its self-appointed role to prevent exactly such a holocaust, is  the subject of this beautifully written, accessible and compelling book.  Gourevitch wants to know WHAT happened, and through interviews with  survivors, gives us the clearest and most comprehensive understanding I  have yet seen. It is not pretty reading, although Gourevitch's  dispassionate and sensitive writing makes it possible to get through  material that in coarser hands would be impossible to stomach. He also  describes the HOW. For years it was evident to the West - and most  particularly to France and Belgium - that Hutu factions were gathering  their strength to strike at the Tutsi minority.  Every day Hutu radio  stations ran violent anti-Tutsi propaganda, in which Tutsis and any  moderate Hutus who were not interested in killing them were warned to  prepare to die. When the killing began, it was simply the next logical step  in a process that had long been underway.  The case seems impossible to  refute - indeed, the UN's internal investigation which published its report  in December 1999 does NOT refute - that the genocide was both broadly  predictable, and could have been ameliorated, if not altogether stopped, by  effective international intervention. The legal knots the UN allowed to  create for itself, so that &quot;blue-helmets&quot; felt they could not act  to save a woman being raped and hacked to pieces, because their mandate  allowed for only their own self-defence, are just one example of how  international law can - sometimes - ENCOURAGE crimes against humanity. The  lessons of Rwanda, painfully learnt, will influence the way the so-called  &quot;world community&quot; responds to massive ethnic eruptions for a  generation to come. To begin to understand this most painful event in  recent human history, this book cannot be too highly recommended.  If there  is one small niggle, it is the lack of an index, something that I hope will  be addressed in future editions.	2000-01-10

Facing middle age, Eric Newby abandons his chosen career as a fashion wholesaler to embark on a whimsical journey to remotest Afghanistan to attempt a mighty peak that has never been  climbed. His companion, an old friend, knows as much about high-altitude  (or ANY) climbing as he does: not a skerrick. They are almost parodies of a  vanished England - absurdly brave, amateurish and uncomplaining; Newby's  account of their scratchings up airy ice-walls will have the sweat  springing from your palms. Along the way we get a rich insight into the  rare mountain societies of one of the most mysterious nations on earth, but  it is Newby's character itself that makes this book such a joy.  Self-mocking, his courage entirely inferred, Newby's modesty holds until  the final hilarious, appalling line.  We may not want to go climbing with  him, but we'd welcome his company on any journey. In fact, Newby's courage  was always a key to his personality. His teenage years were spent as a  high-rigging sailor on grain ships in the Southern Ocean. In World War Two  he was a commando with the Special Boat Squadron. His capture, escape, and  life on the run is memorably recounted in another of his classics  &quot;Love and War in the Appennines.&quot; But for me, &quot;A Short  Walk..&quot; remains his most charming, exciting and extraordinary book.	2000-01-06

I read it shortly before embarking on my own, extremely modest Himalayan climbing career, and it was a powerful warning. An adventure idealist, Cherie Bremer-Kamp and her  partner set out to climb the world's third highest-mountain, in the middle  of the Himalayan winter. Eschewing the big-expedition approach to climbing,  they attack the mountain alone apart from an inexperienced local guide.  They did not lack for courage, experience, or skills. Cherie's climbing  partner and lover had climbed Everest and was a medical doctor. They might  reasonably have known as much as anyone about the dangers of the extreme  cold and the effects of altitude. The final chapters are too gruelling to  recount here - in fact the few sentences in which Cherie recounts the  moment they realise they are in DEEP trouble are as gut-churning in their  simplicity as anything I have read. Were they courageous? Were they  ridiculously naive? My take is that they were people for whom risk was an  essential ingredient in life - but it is not a risk until you stand to lose  something, and they lost more than anyone should have to. A brave and  painful book.	2000-01-06

Representing a Polish news agency, Kapuscinski stays behind when  Portugal abandons Angola and the barbarians come hurtling towards the gate.  He is without protection in a country mad with fear, suspicion, and messy  death. His meditation on the concept of &quot;confusao&quot; - the  Portugese version of confusion - is priceless. His accounts of travelling  to battle-zones on empty roads are terrifying. How good is his information?  Will they be ambushed? Will the next roadblock be friendly or will they be  pulled from their car and killed? Are the risks worth taking? Does anybody  out there care? Kapuscinski renders the absurdity and deep tragedy of  Africa's post-colonial wars with great compassion. It is a moving, sad,  funny and often breathtaking book - the mark against which other  journalists' &quot;I was there&quot; books should properly be measured.	2000-01-06
US	50767887	R1S4TC1W56HX6Q	0140168125	146741920	Big Sur	Books	5	98	101	N	N	A lacerating account of alcoholic descent	Jack Kerouac is famed as the great romantic of the American road, but that reputation ignores his greatest quality as a writer - his searing honesty. By the mid-60s, Kerouac was barely recognisable as the poet laureate of  footloose youth. He was bloated, depressed, and romantically disappointed.  He was also an alcoholic. One of the many heartbreaking passages in  &quot;Big Sur&quot; records his inability to hitch a ride up the  Californian coast. Americans, en route to the summer of love, had annexed  &quot;beat&quot; culture into the rising ethic of hippie-dom. Kerouac  couldn't relate to it, and nor could the hippies relate to him. This cult  hero for many hippies couldn't thumb a ride because - overweight,  middle-aged and dressed as a down-at-heel working man - Kerouac looked no  part of the hippie dream that, in part, he had helped inspire. Alone,  lonely, drinking heavily and in terrible emotional and spiritual pain,  Kerouac miraculously (for us) sustained his extraordinary honesty about his  condition. This, his most truly personal book, is agonising to read - but  it is through this book that we come to know him best, and most deeply feel  his tragedy. If you've ever worried about your own drinking, this is the  book to keep you sober.	2000-01-04

Too much has been  written already - enough to say that Kerouac intuitively felt both the  insane promise of life lived at reckless pace, and the terrifying  loneliness that was such a life's dark side. He was honest to both visions,  and it is that - his searing emotional honesty - that makes this book still  essential and moving reading. (His honesty remained on show in &quot;Big  Sur&quot; the most lacerating first-person account of alcoholic descent  that I imagine it is possible to read). &quot;On The Road&quot; is the only  book that I can say with certainty has changed my life, powering me off as  a young traveller to riches and losses and experiences I would not  otherwise have tasted. If Kerouac has remained in enduring fashion, at  least since the 60s, so too has it always been MORE fashionable to deride  him. If you haven't read this, I urge you to do so. If you're looking for  the antidote to Kerouac - the argument that aimless movement is death, not  life, I strongly recommend Paul Bowles's small masterpiece &quot;The  Sheltering Sky.&quot;	2000-01-04

Bowles, in this slyly subversive book, reverses that. The three Americans who start out on this  largely pointless journey into the North African desert, hope the mere fact  of movement will resolve their deep spiritual lethargy - or at least delay  their having to face it. They imagine themselves sophisticated, wearing  their cynicism as a talisman in a cultural landscape of troubling  strangeness. But they are simply unaware. Faced with an elemental vastness  that cares nothing for their conceits, they dis-integrate. Only one  survives and she is so utterly changed - physically and in spirit - that  she can no longer recognise herself, nor see a future for herself in the  world she formally inhabited. Although the prime characters are  fundamentally unpleasant - at least for most of the book - the lasting  impression is of an eerie, spectral beauty. It is a quiet masterpiece; I  know of few books that are more subtly teasing - that more wisely poke at  our arrogance in imagining that we know anything.	2000-01-04

I bought this for my daughter to encourage her interest in reading. We wound up fighting each other for turns at it. Within a week, with a few past-midnight &quot;power reads&quot; I hoed through every book in the  series.  The first three are superb, each better than the last. There are  some niggles - the stories rely a touch too much on luck and coincidence,  and there is some repetition of ideas. But the strengths are real ones. The  plotting is superb - few writers in any genre can get you turning pages  like Marsden can. The characters are psychologically and emotionally  convincing. The heroism is fairly shared between the boys and the girls in  the group. (The female narrator is a refreshing touch). Negative emotions,  fear, fatigue, impatience, are not shied away from. The central device is  an unexpected invasion of Australia by a foreign force which separates a  group of teenagers from adult supervision, leaving them to rely on their  own resources. It allows Marsden to explore real issues for teenagers about  responsibility, courage, sexual attitudes - even spirituality. All are  delivered without judgement or the author's baggage. The action is so  exciting - real pulse-racing stuff - but from a parent's perspective it  also carries an important theme: life may be difficult, threatening, even  terrifying, but it is always worth living, and courage - in whatever its  form - is a quality everyone can find and one that is always worth seeking  out. I recommend this series to anyone, although the mild sexual references  may make it more appropriate for post-pubescent readers.	1999-12-28

It is well researched, passionately written, and examines and  explains many of the mysteries of war. Why do soldiers suffer much higher  levels of psychiatric disorder than sailors on ships, or civilians  withstanding prolonged bombardment? Why do officers suffer less  psychological trauma than their men, even though in many cases line officer  casualties are much higher? It is disquieting to realise the extent to  which modern military authorities work to overcome our killing inhibitions,  and it raises questions about the ethics of psychologists whose training is  used to this end. It also makes me re-examine the 1994 massacre in Rwanda,  in which - as Philip Gourevitch makes plain in his book - an  extraordinarily high proportion of the Hutu population was involved in the  slaughter of the Tutsi minority. A valuable addition to our understanding  of war and of the human condition that drives it.	1999-11-23
