US	53019309	R1RFASCMMSHR88	0811731731	348660129	Panzer Aces I: German Tank Commanders of WWII (Stackpole Military History Series)	Books	4	28	30	N	N	Very good	I enjoyed this book quite a bit--it has loads of heavy tank fighting, mainly on the Eastern front.  The book is full of accounts of chatter in the turret and between tank commanders and actually reads more like a novel than a traditional military history or even a personal memoir.  Lots of suspenseful tank-on-tank actions.<br /><br />Which leads to a few things I didn't like about the book:  at least in the version of the book that I read, the author does not explain anything about the sources of his dialogs and personal accounts.  Given the very detailed conversations and other personal actions described in the book, presumably the author would have had to interview the participants soon after the actual events to get an accurate recollection of such things.  Or maybe the conversations and recollections are \\"reconstructed\\" (ie, made-up).  Ultimately, I guess it doesn't matter that much if you read the book purely for its entertainment value.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like--the panzer battles start sounding very similar after a while:  if I had a nickle for every time the author described one of the panzer aces hitting a T-34 \\"between the hull and the turret, causing the turret to be blown from the tank\\" I would be a rich man.  Maybe that is where the panzer aces hit all of their targets, but it definitely gave me a sense of deja vu.  Also, the focus of the book is more on describing what the crew is saying and doing rather than what the platoon and company are doing, so there is not much to pick up on small unit tactics from this book.<br /><br />Overall a fun and interesting read but if you want to read something that would teach you more about tank combat, I recommend reading \\"Tigers in the Mud\\" instead.	2005-08-25

Loza covers many very interesting facets of the fighting on the Russian front from a Russian perspective:<br /><br />--what the Russian tankers liked & disliked about their British and US tanks;<br /><br />--being ordered to fire on Russian infantry that was pulling back without orders;<br /><br />--female Russian anti-tank gunners;<br /><br />--armored advance through Mongolia in Summer 1945; etc.<br /><br />Although this book has alot of fresh, interesting information, I only gave it four stars because:<br /><br />--generally I don't think that the book is very well written;<br /><br />--I didn't like the organization very much--the book is essentially a collection of stand-alone chapters on discrete topics or engagements; there is no narrative flow and the book is not intended as a coherent chronological account of the author's experiences in the war.  Indeed, many of the accounts are jumbled chronologically for some reason. Finally, while many of the included accounts were quite interesting, as described above, some of the others, such as \\"Graves Registration\\" and \\"Home Leave\\" polices were less so (at least to me); and<br /><br />--perhaps understandably as a participant of the war, the author does not come across as an objective commenator on the Red Army.	2005-08-02

This is a very good book on operations on the Russian Front.  Raus was clearly a very gifted commander, and his descriptions of his numerous successful operations (both offensive and defensive) are very interesting, as he discusses the risks associated with the various courses of action he could take, why he chose a particular course of action, and the results.<br /><br />Raus was involved in a very wide variety of actions, from the attack toward Leningrad, forcing a passage on a troop-train through partisan-infested forests, attacks attempting to relieve Stalingrad, the Kursk offensive, and the defense of East Prussia.  Once the Germans shifted to the defensive, Raus' \\"trademark\\" tactic was the flexible defense, in which he was (at least according to his testimony) very successful and which probably explains the interest of the US Army in his writings after the war.<br /><br />This book is very good, but I'll mention a few reasons why I only gave it four stars, so you can judge for yourself:<br />--Raus rose from a relatively junior officer at the outbreak of war with Russia to an Army commander by the end of the war.  While I was very interested in his descriptions of the small unit actions in the first part of the book, my interest waned as he became more senior, and I found his accounts of his actions as an army commander fairly dull.<br /><br />--While Raus was clearly a very gifted commander, the book makes it sound like his unit was always succesful--all failures occurred under other commanders on other parts of the front (note that Raus never says this, it is just an impression that arises from reading his accounts).<br /><br />--Maps are pretty sparse.<br /><br />--I didn't find Raus' descriptions of his Russian opponents very objective--he basically describes them as very brave, tough,  clever (in a sneaky sort of way), and prone to atrocities, with only their massive numbers saving them.  Maybe this is the way it was, but I don't think Raus gave the Russkis enough credit.<br /><br />TMR	2005-07-07

His stories, most of which do not exceed a few pages, speak volumes about the extraordinary times in which he lived.  For me, the most interesting aspect of Babel's writing is his ability to convey how the onset of Soviet power changed everything--and yet changed nothing (ie, the cossacks of the Red Army seeking to spread world communist revolution in Poland, and simultaneously reprising past cossack wars and pogroms in the region).  Babel lived in a fascinating, uncertain time, and his vivid diaries describe the Red Army's exhilaration as they sweep westward into Poland--seemingly as the vanguard of a world revolution--and their confusion and dejection as the Polish pans push them back.<br /><br />This book was too intense and too homogeneous for me to read all at once:  many of Babel's stories feature the same themes (chiefly Jewish life and red cavalry) and after a few hundred pages a definite sense of deja vu sets in as Babel reworks various characters, scenes, etc.  Nonetheless, a fantastic book to read in smaller chunks.	2005-06-21

The author addresses not only tank combat, but the whole spectrum of activity at the tactical level--the conduct of route-recon, the vital necessity, and often complete lack, of infantry support, the critical importance of maintenance and vehicle recovery operations, the impact of initiative (or lack thereof) by junior officers, etc.<br /><br />This book is also interesting because it describes many of the personal aspects of the German military:  how the author's commander refused him a jeep necessary for combat operations so that the commander could go womanizing; the relationship between the Werhmacht and SS, and the status of nobleman-officers in the army.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was his repeated harping about how post-war German society betrayed the WWII veterans (...OK, we get the picture...), and to a lesser extent, his scathing remarks about the US army and soldiers (but he is entitled to his opinion, I suppose).<br /><br />Overall, very highly recommended for those interested in tactical armored combat or the Eastern Front.	2005-04-23

I am generally not very interested in mystery/detective books and don't think that I've read any other than a few Sherlock Holmes books many years ago.  That said, I picked this book up on a whim and really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The short novels included in this book all feature LA private eye Phillip Marlowe and are apparently set in the '30s and '40s.  I really liked the following aspects of these novels:<br /><br />1)  It is really fun to read Chandler's descriptions of the places, clothes, cars, slang, mannerisms, characters, etc. of the time.  Marlowe's wise-crack observations, while cliched, often had me laughing out loud;<br /><br />2)  While Chandler uses all of the stock characters (smooth but menacing nightclub owners, sultry crooners, wise-guy PIs, effete rich buffoons, etc.), he really makes most of them come alive with the dialogue and their interactions with each other.  In other words, Chandler does a great job of taking what would seem to be card-board cut-out characters and breathing life into them;<br /><br />3)  Marlowe is able to resolve most conflicts with a couple glasses of whiskey and some wise-cracks, especially if a \\"dame\\" is involved.  Today, it seems like most such conflicts would be resolved with a burst of AK-47 fire or worse.  While no doubt highly idealized, Chandler's more innocent world is appealing to read about.<br /><br />4)  For what it is worth, I am a big fan of the Everyman's Library series (which this edition is part of)--they are attractive, have good heft, include a page-marker ribbon, etc.<br /><br />Probably my only criticism of these novels is that the plots are a bit contrived, but I guess that is part of the fun.<br /><br />TMR	2005-04-12

Rather, the book mainly focuses on:<br /><br />1) the people involved in ferreting out the historical mystery;<br /><br />2) describing the kind of work that the scientists did (think lots of digging and scraping in remote South African locations);<br /><br />3) the personal relationships (and tensions) between the various team members; and<br /><br />4) the author's editorial comments about South Africa and its society.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the book focussed on the process rather than the resulting scientific conclusions, but overall it is a pretty interesting book nonetheless.  People more interested than I am in the four topics listed above should find it interesting indeed.  And if you are thinking about becoming a paleontologist, you should definitely read this book!<br /><br />TMR	2005-04-11

Actually this \\"search\\" was totally perfunctory and uninspired--he essentially drove to a new town every day, stopped in one or two bars, usually in the middle of the day when no one was around, asked the same question (\\"what is the perfect beer joint?\\" to whoever he happened to bump into there, and then moved on to the next town.  Often the people he met said things like \\"you have to come back tomorrow to go to bar x or meet person y\\", but no matter, he was on an expense-account determined schedule and would leave the next morning for the next day's tedious \\"adventure\\". I didn't count, but it sounds like in the course of this \\"search\\" he went into maybe half a dozen bars at night, on a weekend, where you might have any expectation of finding something interesting to write about.<br /><br />2)  While I can't say that the book is dry or overly boring, it is almost completely devoid of actual humour, which I found difficult to believe.  When you're writing about beer, bars, and drunks, it seems inevitable that some pretty funny stuff would creep in, but such is not the case.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  This book was evidently conceived and executed as a quicky, check-the-box type of exercise rather than a true labor of love.  This is a book that begs to be written by someone like Bill Bryson.<br /><br />TMR	2005-04-03

Russian scientists theorize that when the mammoths no longer grazed and churned up the ancient grasslands, the vegetation changed completely, into the tundra-wasteland that it is today.<br /><br />Overall a very enjoyable short book that does not try to puff up the page count with hundreds of pages of irrelevant material.<br /><br />TMR	2005-04-03

Dupuy's Quantified Judgement Model (\\"QJM\\") is essentially a reformulation and extension of Clausewitz's observations on the interplay between the quantity of troops, the quality of troops, and other relevant factors.<br /><br />This book features the calculation of many (rather simple) ratios as Dupuy seeks to illustrate the workings and validity of the QJM.  More interesting, as least to me, is Dupuy's well done analysis of issues such as Diminishing Returns in Combat, Advance Rates in Combat, Attrition in Combat, Friction in Combat (each of these is a chapter in the book) and other similar topics.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found Dupuy's treatment of the QJM interesting, but I am dubious that the model will prove very useful to anyone (except perhaps wargame developers) because while the model correctly identifies the various factors to be quantified, I don't think that, despite Dupuy's attempts, many of these factors can be quantified with any degree of precision.  The real value of this book, in my opinion, are the various discrete conclusions that Dupuy discusses in the book based on his extensive and perhaps unique \\"quant\\" analysis of historical campaigns.  For instance, after analyzing numerous campaigns from Napoleon to the Arab-Israeli Wars, he concludes that the rate of advance of armies have not increased at all from  Napoleon's time to our own, despite the advent of mechanization, etc.!  If this is the kind of thing that interests you, this is the book for you.<br /><br />I gave this book four stars rather than five because the book can be rather dry, and as I said, I ultimately didn't really buy into the usefulness of the QJM as a model of combat.	2004-12-11

If one article bores you, move on to the next...  I found the articles on statistics, logical paradoxes, a 2D Universe (Planiverse) and others very interesting and enjoyable.  It is important to understand that this book is not a puzzle book per se; although almost every articles includes some task for hard-core readers to perform (\\"Prove that...\\", or \\"How many...\\"), it is really intended as reading material.<br /><br />A few negatives:  the articles almost all seem to have been written in the 1950s or 1960s (!); each article has an addendum which attempts to bring it up to date.  Although this didn't matter that much to me, since I have never read anything on recreational mathematics, I doubt that much of the material would be new for anyone that reads the topic regularly.  Similarly, it would have been more interesting to discover what topics are currently \\"hot\\" in this field.  Also, the author spends too much time for my taste on trivial mathematical games such as folding paper into different shapes rather than on really thought-provoking mathematical topics (purely a personal preference, I suppose).	2004-11-23

The first thing to note is that this book only covers the period 1480-1580, so those interested in, for instance, the US dealings with the Barbary States in the 18th Century should look elsewhere.<br /><br />While this book provides decent coverage of the historical events and personages in the relevant period and of the complex relationship between Christian and Muslim of this period, the book suffers from its organization:  the first few chapters essentially run through a rather dry history of the period (X did so and so in year Y, etc.) with later chapters dedicated to overall topics such as \\"The Africa of the Corsairs\\", \\"Slavery\\", and \\"War and Propaganda.\\"  While the material in these final chapters is pretty interesting, the book as a whole would have been much more engrossing if the materials in these chapters would have been woven into the hisorical account instead of simply lumped into seperate chapters.	2004-11-21

If you know ANYTHING about developing games, this book is probably a waste for you.<br /><br />This book served my purposes by showing the concepts to use, and I didn't actually rely on running the code provided with the book (just looked at the code as a starting point for the concepts).  Nonetheless, I think that the book should have used .NET.<br /><br />I didn't like the following things about the book:  the author tries a little too hard to be flip or funny, but it didn't work for me.  Also, he focuses mainly on using 3d tools for 2d graphics, which I never really understood, other than his explanation that all games are going toward 3d, so that is what people should learn.<br /><br />Bottom line:  helpful book for absolute beginners at game development, probably too light for anyone else.  Moreover, I have not found any better alternatives to this book.  Worth buying for beginners, especially if you can buy it used for cheap!	2004-10-25

It is even more blatant than Dodge's praise of Hannibal, which is saying something;<br /><br /> -the language is oddly phrased and stilted, at least to my 21st Century American ear;<br /><br /> -the book is largely a recital of the facts from Polybius and Livy, overlaid with forced or irrelevant comparisons of Scipio's or Rome's situation to some occurence during World War I, the Franco-Prussian War, etc.<br /><br /> Maybe I'm being overly harsh, but I am a big fan of military history, particularly of Roman period, and I was extremely relieved to finally finish this rather tedious book.

One of the best features of his books is that he includes numerous maps and simple drawings to better show the battles, troops, weapons, etc.<br /><br />Limited, like all histories of the Punic Wars, in the available source material, in this book Dodge relies heavily on Polybius and Livy (not that he has a choice).  However, he also relies heavily on his own military experience and visits to the actual battlefields to  present his summary and analysis of the battles, and in this case, of Hannibal's route across the Alps.<br /><br />My one criticism has been noted by other reviewers--Dodge just LOVES Hannibal.  Hannibal is the yardstick by which Dodge measures all other commanders.  While this may be justifiable, it seems a bit overdone.	2004-07-27

The author is very funny, and I found myself laughing out loud at several passages.<br />That said, as other reviewers have pointed out, this book covers two widely divergent topics--Eggers' family situation and a biting commentary on Gen-X careers, etc.  Although I enjoyed the Gen-X portions of the book much more than the, uh, heartbreaking sections on his family situation, the author had a story and tells it very well.<br />Parts of the book tend to drag, but overall very well done.  I would look forward to reading more from the author, ideally something a bit more focussed.<br />tmr	2002-02-11

I guess I expected something like Mark Helprin (A Soldier of the Great War, etc.).  This book starts well but the pace slows to a crawl a third of the way through the book and utilizes contrived and unconvincing mechanisms to move the plot forward.  Finally, I found the characters rather two-dimensional and not particularly appealing.	2002-02-11
US	53019309	R20DJZKIZ0QYJG	0071374973	381044980	Digital Deals: Strategies for Selecting and Structuring Partnerships	Books	3	2	3	N	Y	Disappointing	I have been involved in private equity, acquisitions, and joint ventures for the last several years, and bought this book to learn more about other types of deals, such as e-commerce partnerships, etc.  Given the multiple five star ratings for this book, I expected quite a read.  Unfortunately, although the book is fairly informative, I cannot say that it imparts anything that could not be gained by an attentive reading of the business press--just a chronology of various deals along with their rationale.  I would say that this book would probably be quite useful for a novice or someone that doesn't keep up with their business magazine subscriptions.	2002-01-11
US	53019309	R2SQ9XYRW7455X	0553381393	282597222	Tides of War	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	Not bad, but disappointing	I enjoyed &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; immensely and was a bit disappointed with the pace and main characters in &quot;Tides of War.&quot;  The story spans the 27 year long Pelopenesian War and necessarily skips around to various points in the drawn-out war.  The chapters describing the seige of Syracuse are very interesting, but too much of the book covers the various political and diplomatic machinations during the war.<br />Moreover, I did not care much for the chief characters, who are a bit two-dimensional.  The book's story centers around the career of Alcibiades, who appears to be a very interesting and enigmatic, but not ultimately not very sympathetic, character.  The book's main character, a grizzled mercenary veteran of the war, is also a bit flat and unnattractive.<br />These issues aside, the book does contain some rousing action scenes and the complex diplomatic and political machinations are not completely without interest (just a bit slow).	2001-10-19

Most memorably, he provides interesting profiles of some of the pioneers, cowboys, and charlatans that participated in the creation of America's cell-phone sector.	2001-09-03
